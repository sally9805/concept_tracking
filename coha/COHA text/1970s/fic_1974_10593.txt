had been so beset by business pressures , making ends meet , problems with his children , keeping Elinor calm about his hours and neglect and their debts , that he had n't had time for any thoughts or feelings like this . Except once , one other time , recently , and that was last night in the Lantern Bar when , with those other kooks , he 'd watched Sharon Fields on television . But this one , Gale , she was sitting right in front of him . You could practically reach out and touch it . Ile lifted his gaze to the girl 's face , to see whether she knew what she was doing to him . She was n't even looking at him . She was still glaring furiously at her parents . That look on her face , that pouty mouth , that nest between her legs , all were driving him insane with desire . Briefly , he closed his eyes , and the pantie strip between her legs was torn off , the skirt and blouse were gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Geez , it had been so long since he had entertained such dreams and pleasures . But if you gave it a thought , that was what it was all about . Not all this crummy nonsense about insurance , business , money . ' We were put here to have fun , and he had forgotten it or repressed it and now this reminder of what was essential shook him . Opening his eyes , he realized with sudden despair the vast gulf that stood between him as he was and the person he wanted to be . He avoided looking at Gale , as he tried to sort it out . He tried to bring Elinor into his mind , take inventory . Elinor was what he had , and that was something . That was n't bad either . Fourteen years ago , when he had married Elinor , he had been excited by her . Yet , it was difficult to remember how he had been , and difficult to remember her as she had been . Ile tried desperately to remember . A tall young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He , still with his football-hero aura , and she worshippinghim . He had lusted for her , married her in Las Vegas , made her quit her job in the advertising agency to be available for him all the time , to give him a real home and eventually some kids . Elinor and himself , it had been a hot thing for five , six , even seven years . ' I'hcn what happened ? Probably what always happens to people when they are married . Too much sameness , too much closeness , with weaknesses and blemishes becoming clearer , and the need for wanting , pleasing , diminished by love turned into companionship . Of course , he cacti ! Iw her still . Nevertheless , the wear of years and marital attrition showed . She , exhausted from the children , the house , the budget . IIe , weary troth work , overwork , too much work , and the disappointment of time ' tc.tlly as lucking scctuity . But it 's always like that , he told himself , except for the privileged few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by time 's passage and the close-upness of living together , this Gale before him would become another Elinor , and the act he lusted for now would merely turn into one long conversationyears from now . Having solved it , he felt that he could look up at Gale once more withoutbecoming so excited and disturbed . He lifted his head and set his eyes upon her . There she was , legs high and parted , and the strip of panties teasing him . His heart began pounding . Forget Elinor . Forget that this one would grow into an Elinor . See her for what she is and has this moment . He wanted her , a night out with her , or with a reasonable facsimile . How he wished it was conventiontime again , the Fairmont in San Francisco , the Fontainebleau in Miami Beach , the Chase-Park Plaza in St. Louis , with all those greatlookinghookers coming up to your room when you bent your finger . But it was too long to wait , and maybe it was n't necessary . This kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She must know what she was doing to him , a total stranger , teasing him this way , telling him something , asking for it . Suddenly , it was important for Yost to contact her , let her know that he was getting the message , let her know who he was and what she 'd be getting . To hell with the Livingstons and that crummy , dreary policy . It was Gale he wanted to sell . She had to know that Howard Yost was more than a miserable insurance agent . He was a star , a headliner , a somebody , or he had been once , and not that long ago , not before she was born . He glanced at the Livingstons . They were still absorbed in the program folder . Well , he 'd pretend to be talking to them , but his words would be directed to their daughter . Let her know who Howard Yost truly was , and watch her react . He could play it by ear from there on . " You know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space between the Livingstons and Gale , " I was just sitting here thinking of when I was back in college , not many years ago . University of California in Berkeley . I never dreamt at the time that one day I would be underwriting insurance policies . I always thought I might eventually be  --  " He hesitated . What would Gale like him to be ? "  --  a newspaper columnist or television commentator , believe it or not . " Ile chuckled , modestly . Mr. and Mrs. Livingston looked up blankly , nodded %agucly , and resumed their reading . Yost would not yet allow himself to see whether Gale was at last attentive , curious , interested . He hurried on . " But instead , as chance would have it , my destiny was directed by my pituitary gland . I was a big young man . Tall , muscular , powerful , and I was noticed by everyone , the fellows , the girls , and they talked me into trying out for the football team . I made the team right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Became left tackle . By my senior year  --  well , you may have read about it  --  I was co-captain of the Rose Bowl team and I was elected to the second A11-American team by the sportswriters of the nation . Anyway , all the important alumni were after me to join their businesses as an associate , and this one man who was an executive with Everest Life Insurance Company , he  --  " " Father ! " It was Gale , sitting up impatiently . " How much more time is this going to take ? I 've got just ten minutes before I have to call  --  " " You hold your tongue , and do n't interrupt us again , " said Mr. Livingstonsternly . " This is going to take exactly as long as I feel it should take . " With a show of temper , Gale leaped to her feet , ready to storm out . That moment , Yost fully realized that she had been unaware of him entirely . To her , he was no more interesting than a rusting old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livingston , " he said to her impulsively . He had no more interest in remaining here or in discussing the insurance program . Selling the policy solved nothing important , certainly not the frustrationand unrest churning inside him . Selling the policy was like trying to repair a broken dream with a Band-Aid . He turned to the Livingstons , making a thing of pointing to his fancy silver wristwatch . " I had no idea it was this late . Why do n't I leave you , let you talk to your daughter , have your dinner ? The program I 'm recommending is spelled out there in full detail . I should give you time to absorb it and discuss it together . " He gathered his papers and stuffed them into his briefcase and stood up . " Why do n't I phone you at your office tomorrow , Mr. Livingston ? If you have any questions , or see anything that requires clarification , I 'll be happy to answer or explain on the phone . Or come back and see you in person again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A few minutes later , after a puzzled Mr. Livingston had shown him out the door , Howard Yost sat behind the wheel of his Buick , trying to figure out what had got into him . This had never happened before . But then , he had never been forty-one years old before . Or married fourteen years before . Or realized that he was never going to be successful before . Or known so clearly what had passed him by , and what he would never have , before . Ile turned the ignition key and started the car . I-ie was in no mood to go home . But then , there was no place else to go. toA half hour later , he was home . The drive on the freeway and Ventura Boulevard to Encino had settled him down somewhat and restored some degree of balance plus guilt . Letting himself into the house , putting away the briefcase , pulling off his jacket , loosening his tie , he could see Elinor in the dining room setting the table . " Howdy , honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " This 'll be a first . " " What does that mean ? " " Having dinner at a normal hour like other people do . " She finished with the table , and came into the living room . He watched her , feeling Gale-guilty , feeling regret and failure for not having followed through with the Livingstons on the policy , feeling he owed something to her for his shortcomings . He held his arms out wide , mock romantic , waiting for her . " I missed you , " he said . " I came home earlier because I missed you . You look wonderful . " She smoothed her hair . " I look like hell , and you know it . Do n't treat me like one of your clients . " He dropped his arms , as she came to him and kissed him , holding him briefly to let him know she was sorry for her unintended harshness . " How are the kids ? " he asked . " Tim is getting too fresh with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll listen if it comes from you . Nancy missed her ballet class . I think she 's coming down with a cold . Well , as long as you 're here , think you can be ready for dinner in fifteen minutes ? " " I 'd like a drink first . Want to have one with me ? " " No , thanks . " He shrugged , went to the cherrywood cabinet , opened it , took out the bottle of gin and the bottle of vermouth . " How was your day ? " " The usual . Busy . I do n't know where it went . Put the house together in the morning . Vacuumed . I emptied the drawers in the bedroom chests and relined them . I left out a lot of old socks and shirts you no longer wear . I wish you 'd go through them and tell me what I can throw out . ' then , let me see , I did some shopping at the market . Your father called and had me on the phone for at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to face it , Howard . He is becoming senile . Oh yes , Grace phoned . They 're just back from four days in Las Vegas . They had a super time . I wish we could get away at least once in a while like other people do . " Ile finished pouring his martini . " I wish we could have money sometimelike other people have , " he said sourly. 43 " What are you telling me ? That I spend too much ? " " I 'm telling you nothing , Elinor . ' Why do n't you just let me have my drink in peace and catch up on the morning paper . " " Now I 'm a nag . " " I did n't say you 're a nag . I just said I 'd like a few minutes to relax before dinner . " Elinor glowered at him , bit her tongue , turned and went into the kitchen . Wearily , Yost yanked the sports section out of the paper , and sipping his martini , sank into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his martini , and felt a little better . He decided that if one martini made you feel better , two martinis might make you feel good , maybe . He got up , practically filled the glass with gin , added a dash of vermouth , then went into the kitchen in search of an olive . As he entered the kitchen , Elinor eyed the drink and frowned . " You 're not having another one , are you ? It looks more like three . " " Why not ? " he said . " It 's a free country . " " Because I know how it makes you . Anyway , dinner 's almost ready . " " It can wait . " " It ca n't wait . Everything will get cold . Ca n't you skip the second drink for once ? " " No , dammit . Get off my back , Elinor , will you ? I 've had a hard day . " He waited for her to inquire solicitously about his hard day , to give him some sympathy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized that he had n't given her much sympathy for her hard day . The game was a tie at half time . He slouched back to the living room , determined to get high . He drank at his own pace , making haste slowly . Several times Elinor emerged from the kitchen to watch him with disapproval and ask if he was ready . He was not , and he said so , but a half hour later , slightly anesthetized , he began to feel more kindly toward Elinor and finally he joined her at the table . Throughout the meal , he beamed at her and nodded as he ate , half listening as she reviewed the day in greater detail . Her range of subject matter , he told himself , was awesome . A treatise on bed making . A historyof inconsequential telephone calls . A diatribe on the prices of food at the shopping center . A psychological report on the children and their problems . A fiscal account of the family finances , with emphasis on unpaidbills and creditors . A genealogy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get some rest , find some relief. 44The last be understood . Briefly , he felt warmth for her and wanted warmth back . She was a person , too , his person , and he could have done worse , much worse , all things considered . He was definitely feeling high , and Elinor was beginning to look as young and attractive as she had once been . The mood heightened . He leaned toward her , and gave her a mock leer . " Tell you what , honey , how 's about our getting into bed early for a little lovemaking ? " She grimaced and brought her finger to her lips . " Shhh . Do you have to be so loud ? Do you want the children to hear ? " " They know the stork did n't bring them . What do you say , honey ? " " I say it 's about time you showed some interest . " She wiped her mouth with her napkin , got up , and began to clear the dishes . " We 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home again . He pushed hack his chair , left the table , looking for a cigar . Finding one , lighting it , he wondered whether it was like this in other places with other women . Was it like this with the couple in the White House or the couple in BuckinghamPalace or with the chairman of Everest Life Insurance Company and his wife in their Manhattan town house ? Was it like this with those wild movie stars in Holmby Hills and Bel Air ? It simply could n't be when you were Somebody , with power and wealth and all the freedom and options on earth . Elinor had returned to the dining room from the kitchen , and was putting away the place mats . " Anything special on the agenda for tonight ? " he asked her . " If you mean , are we seeing anyone  --  no , not until Saturday night . " " What 's with Saturday night ? " " We promised to go over to the Fowlers ' for some gin rummy . " " Again ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you liked them . " " Once in a while , once in a while . What are you going to do now ? " " Finish up in the kitchen . Then I just want to get off my feet . I have some sewing to do . And if I do n't get too sleepy , I 'd like to finish that novel and get it back to the library before it 's overdue . " " Where are the kids ? " " Glued to the television set , what else ? I sometimes think we 're too permissive , letting them watch that endless junk night in and night out . You ought to put your foot down about that . Let them watch only after they 've done their homework properly and cleaned up their rooms . You should see what a mess their rooms are . " " Okay , sure , " he said . She started for the kitchen again , and he went45to the hallway to say hello to his twelve-year-old , Tim , who was as big as he himself had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turning out to be quite a pretty girl , even with her braces . I le entered the spare room which had never been completely furnished and was used as a catchall playroom to segregate the children , especially when there were guests in the house . Tim and Nancy were both seated cross-legged on the maroon carpet , their attention riveted to the color television set. " howdy , monsters , " he greeted them. ' l'iiu lifted a hand and waved without turning around . Nancy quickly got to a knee to kiss him . he indicated the set . " What are you watching ? " " It 's just a lousy Western , " piped Tim . " We 're waiting for what comes next . " " The premiere , " added Nancy . " There 's going to be an hour program on the premiere of Sharon Fields ' great new picture , The Royal Harlot , at Grauman 's Chinese . Sharon Fields is going to be there herself in person . " " She 's sexy , " said Tim , eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite in the whole world , " said Nancy . Yost sat down on the edge of the scarred captain 's chair , puffing his cigar , remembering suddenly the crazy encounter in the bar of the AllAmericanBowling Emporium last night . If he ever dared repeat it to anyone , they 'd think he had made it up . That fruity writer kid , Adam Malone , the self-styled expert on Sharon Fields , with his fanciful scheme about picking her up , kidnapping her , and how he could guarantee she would n't mind it , would in fact put out for all of them . Ile had an uncontrollable flash of young Gale Livingston sitting across from him a few hours ago , her legs high and parted , her smooth thighs and slip of panties visible and taunting him . His mind erased Gale , and replaced her with Sharon Fields , the actress with the most beautiful and provocative body on earth , across from him , legs up and parted , revealing what was between them . For a moment last night that far-out young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought Sharon Fields within reach of his life . Boy , there were some real crazies on the loose in this city . But the picture of Sharon Fields remained iii his mind . Could any female beauty ever look in person the way she looked on the screen ? lie wondered what Sharon Fields would be like in person . Could she possibly be as fabulous as they made her out in her movies orAsin those posed pictures ? He doubted it . They never were . Still , you did n't become famous and worshipped like that unless you had something for real . " When does the premiere start ? " he asked the children . Tim held up his astronaut watch . " Ten minutes , " he said . Yost was on his feet . " Enjoy it , but see that you get to bed right after . " Ile made his way to the kitchen . Elinor was stacking dishes , her backto him . He came up behind her , and kissed her on the cheek . " Honey , I just remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . I wo n't be long . " " You just came home . Where are you going now ? " " Back to the office . I have to dig out some papers I forgot to bring with me . Have to bone up on a special program I 'm pitching to a new prospect in the morning . It could be a fat one . " Elinor was mildly exasperated . " Why ca n't you be like other men ? Other men find things to do besides work . Is n't there any time that belongs to us ? " " It 's a living , " he said . " If I can carry off a few of these programs , we both might be able to relax a little more . I 'm not doing this just for myself , you know . " " I know , I know . You 're doing everything just for us . Well , see that you 're not out all night . " " Just to the office and back , " he promised . Ile headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeway traffic was n't heavy , he could be in Hollywood in twenty minutes or so . Ile was sure he would n't be too late to see her in person . This same Tuesday , at half past six in the evening , Leo Brunner was still at work in the rear corner of Frankie Ruffalo 's private office above Kuffalo 's popular key club , The Birthday Suit , located on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood . The Birthday Suit , which offered its member patrons luncheons , dinners , cocktails , and continuous entertainment provided by a threepiececombo and a variety of topless and bottomless dancers , was Leo . $runner 's most glamorous account and by far his favorite one . For days in advance , before his monthly visit to check out accounts receivable mid accounts payable in Ruffalo 's double-entry ledger , Brunner looked forward to the tedious task with ever-increasing anticipation . As certified public accountants went , Leo Brunner 's operation was47definitely small-time and his clients were in modest income brackets . There was a one-girl , two-room office , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low-rent area of Western Avenue , where Brunner did much of his work . In his own office , flanked by typewriterand computerized adding machine ( as important to him as one of his limbs ) , Brunner did his paper work  --  preparing and mailing out his report summaries , his confirmation requests to the customers or creditors of his clients , suggestions and recommendations to businesses he representedon improved accounting or record-keeping procedures . The part of his profession that he enjoyed the most was the part that took him outside his office to visit a client 's firm , examine books on the client 's home ground . But even these visits were not fully gratifying , except the monthly visit to Frankie Ruffalo 's daring private club . Several times , leaving the club , going down the stairs to the rear-door exit , Brunner had lingered backstage briefly to watch Ruffalo 's nude girls perform . Sometimes there was a single girl doing her dance alone . Other times there was a line of girls . The girls were always young , pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sway and swing and gyrate to the music , and halfway through their number they would remove their panties or short skirts , and reveal their fronts and bottoms totally nude , completely exposed . Brunner had never had an opportunity to observe them up close , as the customers did  --  they danced from the stage along a raised platform that projected right to the center of the club  --  but even at a distance he had found them stimulating . Tonight , hunched over the second desk behind Ruffalo 's own more ornate desk , his pencil footing the accounts in the ledgers , Leo Brunner was particularly distracted and finding it more and more difficult to concentrate . Through the closed office door he could hear the music below , the faint drift of fun talk and hilarity and good times and applause and it was hard to keep his mind on those debit and credit numerals that kept blurring and running together . Tonight , his work had taken almost twice as long as it normally did , but if he really devoted himself to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he seemed tumble to close out the books with his usual dogged efficiency , and finally he sat back in the creaky swivel chair and wondered why , wondered what was wrong with him . He smoothed the fringe of graying hair around his partially bald pate , removed his steel-rimmed glasses to give his tired eyes a rest , and involuntarilylooked into himself to audit his thoughts . Maybe , he had been thinking , it was his age that was slowing him clown . lie was fiftytwoyears old , married for thirty of those years to one woman , and with-aout children . But age could n't be it , or fitness , either . Because Brunner 's work was sedentary , he had always looked after his weight . He was five feet nine inches tall and weighed 155 pounds , which was just about right . He had done three exercises every morning for years to give himself some conditioning . He ate organic health food and yogurt regularly . He doubted that either his age or his fitness was what was slowing him down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were great lovers and much admired by younger women . Reflecting upon his situation , he nipped a thought and had a sudden insight on what was wrong . Plainly , what had been arresting his concentrationwas the emotion that he had just isolated . Two negative feelings , really  --  one of resentment , the other of self-pity . Brunner was a mild man , a quiet man , a timid man , devoid of envy or jealousy . He had never considered himself a person who could resent anyone or anything . Still , it was there inside him like a floating ulcer , the resentment , and he realized it was not anyone or anything special that he resented , but just life itself , the way life had marked him as a long-term liability instead of an asset . Life had written him off and passed him by , while downstairs there were men his own age , many even older than fifty-two , uninhibited , unencumbered , with bulging wallets and refreshed highballs eyeing gorgeous girls in the nude and sometimes bringing those girls to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it except that life could be fun for people who knew how to have fun and could afford to pay for it . He resented the unfairness of the way some Maker , some Cosmic Force , had given most people the means and right to have pleasure and given a minority like himself the limited means and limited right to be workhorses permitted only the barest minimum of hedonistic indulgence . There was a terrible inequity in this , and , yes , he resented the injustice of it . Digging into his suit pocket for the packet of soya beans he always carried with him , he tore it open , popped some beans in his mouth , and reflected further on his negative , decidedly negative , state of mind . Self-pity was the dominant pain he felt . He had made a mistake early , very early , when he was twenty-two , and he was paying for it still . He wanted to place the blame on Thelma , but he saw that blaming her was unreasonable . The choice had been his own . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a victim of his past , his parents , unloving , his upbringing , unloving , and so many like himself were victims , and when he 'd fallen in love with Thelma his last year at the University of Santa Clara , and she had loved him back49as no one ever had , he had clung to his one chance to possess someone who cared . He had intended to become a lawyer , meant to be one , had been qualified for the profession , had planned to take it up . In fact , his application for entrance to the College of Law at the University of Denver had already been accepted . Instead , he had married Thelma , and when she became pregnant , he was dutifully proud of how she depended upon him and he felt his responsibility to her and to their as yet unborn child . The least he owed his two was a living . So he had passed up the Denver College of Law , set his sights lower , decided upon certified public accounting as a respectable second cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By going to night school , he had eventually completed the forty-five semester units of required courses needed under California state law before he could take the State Board of Accountancy tests . He had crammed for the tests , taken them in San Diego , passed with flying colors , and emerged a full-fledged CPA . Meanwhile , their child had been born prematurely and was stillborn , and Thelma could never have another . After three years in the employ of a Beverly Hills business managementfirm  --  a firm which was too large to provide any opportunity for advancement and too high-powered for his unfortunate retiring personality  --  he had gone into business on his own , working out of an apartment , with Thelma serving as his secretary . Eventually , with dreams of glory , he had opened his own office , the same stick-in-the-mud office he 'd kept all these many years . It had not worked , or at least not worked as he had hoped , he could see that now . There were some people in his profession , accountants no better trained than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Name clients , important firms , their own suites of huge posh offices . Sometimes they even called themselves business managers , and made more money and were regarded with even more respect . Leo Brunner had never been able to make it that way . He supposed it was because he was not enough of an extrovert , a salesman , a gambler . He ( lid not have that kind of personality or style . He was meant to be not a legend but a number , a number close to zero . Or more accurately , if one rcally wanted to pamper self-pity , he was meant to be no more than a human adding machine , a calculator that also happened to be able to walk and talk . He had settled for , had even been grateful for , small , unromantic , pedestrian accounts . He did the books for a meat market , a trucking company , a small toy manufacturer , a chain of hamburgerstands , an organic food store ( where , in lieu of full pay , he was allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , doing books for The Birthday Suit , had come to him by accident on a referral from one of his business clients who belonged to the club . During a crackdown by vice squads and obscenity investigators , Ruffalo had needed a conservative , unobtrusive accountant quickly to get his books in order , in case the police used Internal Revenue as a means of closing him up . Brunner had fit the bill perfectly , and Brunner had been hired at once . Somehow , Brunner felt now , the very qualities that had retarded him as a CPA would have helped him as an attorney . Public accounting was a gray profession , and if you were a gray personality and went into it , you became invisible . But law was a more colorful profession , bright and important in itself , and your very colorlessness rendered you more credible , honest , respected , and therefore made you successful . Had he taken the step long ago , gone into law , he would have made it . He would be wealthy and successful today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Birthday Suit , drinking champagne , living life to the hilt , instead of being cooped up here in some anonymous and dreary office . It had been his fault from the start . He blamed no one else . Although his neighbor in Cheviot Hills and his best friend , Parmalee , who was in the same boat , blamed it on something else . Parmalee always liked to say , when it came up , that Brunner and himself  --  both of whom had given up law school for early marriages  --  had been victimized by the moral attitudes of their time . It was a time when you felt you had to marry a girl to have sex with her . So Parmalee and Brunner had given up their careers and futures for sex without guilt . Had they lived in the present day , things would have been different . They would not have felt that they had to marry in order to sleep with their girls . They would have been able to have both their chosen careers and guilt-free sex . So here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there was Parmalee , stuck as an agent in the Internal Revenue Service for twenty years , with no chance to better himself . It was sad , the whole thing . With a sigh , Leo Brunner restored his glasses to the bridge of his pointed nose , hunched forward in his swivel chair , and prepared to resume his work and complete it as quickly as possible . No sooner had he picked up his pencil , than the office door whipped open and Frankie Ruffalo erupted into the room . Brunner started to call out hello , but Ruffalo was unaware of his presence as he hastenedto his large oak desk . Ruffalo was a small , swarthy man with beady eyes and a pencil-thin moustache , who always seemed to be wearing a new expensive outfit , such as the ascot , suede jacket and slacks he was sportingthis moment . For so successful an entrepreneur , he was surprisingly young , in his early thirties , Brunner guessed . Pulling off his stylish pocketless jacket , Ruffalo threw it on the divan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not alone . " Oh . Sig told me you were here . I thought you 'd be finished by now and gone . " " There has been quite a backlog to make up , Mr. Ruffalo . I can be out of here in a half hour . " " Naw . Does n't matter . Just stay where you are and do your job . I have other fish to fry . One of my best girls quit on me . I 've got to audition for a replacement fast . " " I could move to another  --  " " Naw , naw . Stay put . You wo n't be in the way . No one 'll notice you . " Brunner could not believe that no one would notice him . " Really , Mr. Ruffalo , if you 're auditioning girls , maybe you 'd prefer to be alone with  --  " Ruffalo interrupted impatiently . " I said stay . For Chrissakes , Leo , do I have to write it out for you ? Forgive me , but having you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a compliment . So go on with your homework . " For Brunner , it was no compliment , none whatsoever . Hurt , he bent over the ledger . Usually , he was inured against life 's daily assaults upon his dignity . He had long ago accepted being a nonperson , a pattern on the wallpaper . But tonight his sensitivity was exposed and raw , and Ruffalo 's remark rankled . He tried to resume his double-entry accounting , but Ruffalo 's movements and talk intruded . Ruffalo had picked up his telephone receiver and apparently buzzdialedthe dressing room down the hall . " Hello , Sig ? How many showed up ? " He listened . " Okay , send the three of them in on the double . " Finished with the telephone , Ruffalo paced briefly , then went to the door , opened it , poked his head out . " Okay , girls , move your fat asses . Right in here . " he returned to his desk , drumming his manicured fingernails on its top , as he waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limy entered the office quickly , one after the other , three of them , each greeting Ruffulo warmly or flirtatiously . Ruffalo acknowledged each with a flip of his hand , and ordered the last of the three to shut the door. 12 " All right , girls , let 's not waste any time , " said Ruffalo . " Line up there in front of the sofa . " Obediently , the three women went to the sofa , and they stood at attention on the white furry throw rug before it . From the corner of an eye , Brunner , while pretending to work , glanced at them . Each one was gorgeous , maybe a little obvious in attire and manner , but each young and striking . " You know why you 're here , " said Ruffalo curtly . " I 'm sure Sig briefed you . I need one of you . I 'm going to hire one of you . I 'll need you to fill in on the late show tonight . You understand that ? " The young women nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " said Ruffalo , pointing to the platinumhairedgirl nearest him , " give me your names  --  just the first name for now  --  your last entertainment job  --  the reason you quit or were fired  --  and your best type of dance for a club like this . Okay , I 'm listening . " Brunner swiveled his chair a bit to his left for a better view of the girls across the room . His eyes feasted on each one as she spoke in turn . The first , the platinum blonde , had a rosy mouth , wet lips , a Nordic appearance . She was wearing a purple turtleneck sweater , abbreviated yellow skirt , panty hose , lilac leather boots . Her voice was high-pitched . " My name is Gretchen . I was employed as a model for the Grosser Agency . I modeled underthings . One manufacturer I did shows for  --  his wife took a dislike to me , she was jealous , I guess  --  so she had me fired . That was a few months ago . There have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Your best dance ? " inquired Ruffalo . " I can bump and grind . " " Good . Next one . " Brunner 's eyes moved to the middle girl , shorter than the other two , fuller all around , too , maybe five feet three . She had chestnut hair bobbed short , flared nostrils , the biggest bosom of the three . She was wearing a loose T-shirt and velvet pants to match her hair . " My name is Vicky . I did a solo number twice a night at Al 's Eatery near the airport . A topless joint . Well-off clientele . I quit when this dentist , a regular , started dating me and told me he was going to marry me . I dropped out , shacked up with him for a year . We had a spat and he walked out . I 'm ready to do my thing again . I can do a mean belly dance . " " Fine . Are you in shape ? " Vicky grinned . " See for yourself , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Okay , you , " he said , gesturing toward the third one. 54She had lustrous red hair that fell to her shoulders , a round , creamy ingenue 's face , broad shoulders and hips , but a narrow waist and long legs . She wore a clinging knee-length dress , no stockings , sandals . She spoke in a drawl , playing with her hair as she talked . " You can call me Paula . I 'm a photographer 's model . In the buff . I got busted for possessionin San Francisco . It was a second offense so they put me away for a while . Afterwards , I thought I 'd move down here . Just started looking for something to do . Thought I 'd try something different . " " Are you off dope ? " asked Ruffalo . " What do you think ? Sure . I 'm clean . I 've never danced professionally , but I used to take lessons . Interpretive stuff . Isadora Duncan style . I can pep that up , of course who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up . " Okay , so far so good . Now , for my trade , the most important part . " He swept his hand toward the three girls . " Okay , let 's see what you have . Take it off . " In the far corner of the office , Brunner gulped , and shrank back from his ledger , sliding down in his seat , furtively glancing at the girls to see whether they were aware of him or embarrassed by his presence . Not one of them appeared to know there was anyone in the room besides Ruffalo and their competitors . Amiably , leisurely , each one undressed . Brunner had never been through anything quite like this , three gorgeousyoung women stripping down simultaneously , doing so without hesitation , possibly with pleasure . Brunner 's eyes jumped from one to the other , not knowing on which one to focus , trying to hold on every exposedbit of epidermis at once . Gretchen lifted her turtleneck sweater slowly , carefully , so as not to muss her platinum hair . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid down on the divan . Her breasts were small , high , conical , the pink nipples tiny and pointed . She unzipped her skirt , stepped out of it . Now she balanced herself to tug off each leather boot , lay it aside . Then she rolled down her panty hose , and stepped out of them , also . She stood straight . She had a flat belly , a protruding rib cage , and a thin patch of pubic hair that did not hide the line of her vulva . The smaller one , Vicky , had got rid of her T-shirt , and when she took off the transparent band that passed for a bra her heavy breasts dropped slightly . She kicked off her pumps , and expertly stepped out of her velvet pants . She was wearing only bikini briefs underneath . She drew thema ' down , and freed herself from them . She smoothed the brown pubic hair below , then grinned up at Ruffalo , waiting . Ruffalo had been giving his attention to the third one , Paula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her dress and wiggling out of it . She wore nothing underneath , no bra , no panties . There had just been the dress . From his corner , Leo Brunner gaped at her . Paula looked the most naked , most exciting of the three , with those broad fleshy shoulders , large round breasts with reddish nipples , wide thighs enclosing a long thatch of hair that ran halfway up her belly . Brunner realized that what was happening to him was something that had n't happened in months . He could feel himself getting an erection . He eased himself closer to the desk , praying no one would see . But then he was again reminded that they did n't even know he was alive . Brunner 's gaze shifted to Ruffalo , who had risen from his executive chair and strolled closer to the girls , inspecting them minutely . He was silent before Gretchen . Reaching Vicky , he slapped her belly lightly , then bent and felt one of the calves of her legs . " Guess you 've kept in shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " said Vicky . Ruffalo stood before Paula , stepping back from her , examining her nude body from top to bottom , his brow furrowed . " Turn around , Paula . " She turned around , displaying her buttocks , then came full circle . " Everyone says I 've got a great bottom , " she said matter-of-factly . " Not bad , " muttered Ruffalo . He narrowed his eyes . " You sure you 're off dope ? " " Cross my heart . I would n't dare risk being picked up again . " " We 'll see . All right , girls . Paula 's got the job . But you other two , you stand by for the next forty-eight hours . If she does n't work out or if she double-crosses me , I 'll call on one of you . You can get dressed now . " While Gretchen and Vicky started dressing rapidly , Paula came forward . " Gee , thanks , Mr. Ruffalo . You wo n't be sorry . " " We 'll see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure you report back here by nine thirty . You 'll go on at ten . See Sig before you go on . He 'll brief you about cues and rehearse you on your moves . He 'll fill you in on your pay and hours for the rest of the week . " He started for the door . " Thanks , girls , thanks a lot . " Ruffalo was gone . Now alone in the office with the young women , two partially dressed , one utterly naked , Brunner felt hot and flushed . He tried to pretend55that he was ignoring them , devoting himself to his work , but he felt their eyes were on him , and a world of wild possibilities spun through his head . He looked up furtively , only to see that no eyes were upon him , that Gretchen and Vicky were now fully clothed , and bidding Paula good-bye and wishing her good luck . They left , and Paula , still stark-naked , remained . Brunner found it impossible to swallow . He tried not to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , half waltzing , half walking around the room , happily humming to herself . Then she came to a halt and surveyed the office . Her gaze went across the room , right past Brunner , not even stopping on him , right past him as if he were an inanimate object , like an adding machine , say . Her gaze lit on what she was looking for . She started across the room , approaching Brunner , a tower of exquisite flesh , coming nearer and nearer , the flagrant outthrust breasts shimmying ever so little . Brunner held his breath , and then she had gone past him without recognition or a word . She paused before the water cooler , found a paper cup , filled it , and drank with evident pleasure . At last , dropping the cup into the wastebasket , she went past Brunner once more , completelyoblivious of him , reached the divan , stepped into her pumps , took up her dress , and cheerfully put it on , humming steadily . A few minutes later , she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what ?  --  a tiny damp spot on his fly , and a bitter feeling that he did not exist for any of those people who crowded his mind and churned his desires . Those girls , that good life out there , all that was for real people , visible people with identities , the achievers , the somebodies . He was the total nobody . The zero . And it was not right , simply not right , because there was so much inside of him , hidden but simmering , that told him he was a person , a really interesting person , that those on the outside did not bother to see . He was a person who deserved something , who deserved better . Wretchedly , he tried to resume his work . It took him nearly an hour before he was able to close the books . By the time he had finished , he knew that he was too late for dinner at home . In fact , he had told Thelma not to wait for him if he did not show up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thelma and her older sister , Mac , who lived with them , would have eaten already . He decided to call his wife , tell her he 'd grab a sandwich at a health food Estrtuant two blocks away , and be home right after . Marla dialed his home . Just his luck for today , his sister-in-law Maemeanswered . It meant that he had to go through the routine with her that was repeated whenever he had done his monthly chore at The Birthday Suit . She would tease him about such a tough job all men should have , spending a day surrounded by naked ladies and calling that work . With an inner groan , he sat back and let Mae go into her routine . When she was mercifully done , he asked her to put Thelma on . His wife came on the line . " That you , Leo ? Where are you ? Do you know how late it is ? " " I 'm still at the club . Just finishing up . Did you eat dinner ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then I 'll have a sandwich at the place down the street , a few blocks from here . " " Just watch what you eat when you 're out , Leo . " " I will , I will . I should be home inside an hour . Would you like to go to a movie tonight ? There 's something good playing in Culver City . " " Thank you for thinking of me , but not tonight , Leo . If you felt the way I feel , you 'd want to crawl into bed and die . " He was used to this . " How do you feel ? Is there anything wrong ? " " The arthritis again . In my shoulders . In my back . It 's been killing me all day . I 'm not even going to wash my hair tonight . I 'm going to bed to get some rest . If you want to go to a movie , you go , Leo . I have no objections . " " I 'll see . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When you come home , I 'll be asleep . If I 'm so lucky . " " Good-night , Thelma . " He lowered the receiver into the cradle , and remained inert in his place . He was n't hungry . He did n't feel like eating a thing . Maybe a movie . At least that was a kind of escape . I-ie reached for the morning newspaper lying folded on the desk . Opening it to the entertainment section , he scanned the advertisements . Suddenly his eyes were arrested by a large star-circled ad headlined : GLAMOROUS PREMIERE TONIGHT ! SHARON FIELDS IN PERSON ! Leo Brunner sat up , looking fixedly at the full-length photograph of the half-clad Sharon Fields in a languorous , fetching supine position . His mind skipped backward to last night 's remarkable adventure at the bowling alley in Santa Monica . The strange young man who thought they could meet Sharon Fields and even  --  but the young man was certainly a psychopath . Leo Brunner stared down at the ad again . Ile had never attended a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in person . If the three girls who had just been in this office had proved sexually provocative , Brunner imagined that Sharon Fields would prove a hundredfold more arousing . He was in a rut , mired in self-pity , and mildly depressed . Here was an event , a glamorous event , free to the public . Here was an opportunity to observe the most desirable young woman in the world . To attend such an event , enjoy the sight of such a woman , might be an activity to enrich a dull life and offset a particularly unhappy day . Leo Brunner made up his mind . The night was young . There was still time to go to a movie , after all . This same Tuesday , at seven twenty in the evening , Adam Malone , his eyes constantly darting to the clock on the wall , knelt between the cartons of cat food in the second to last row of the Peerless Supermarket on Olympic Boulevard , ever conscious that he must hurry if he expected to arrive at the premiere on time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only  --  his choice , because the precious rest of his day was dedicated to writing  --  his hours of work were fairly flexible . Yesterday he had warned the market manager that he would be cutting out at seven thirty sharp , and the manager had sourly agreed to it . Now , Malone saw there were only ten minutes left in which to mark and stack what remained of the cat food . Swiftly , Malone sliced the lids off the four remaining cartons . Then , consulting the latest retail price list , he selected the appropriate rubber stamps , and began stamping the prices on the tins of tuna , chopped giblets , meat by-products , fish and liver . In eight minutes , he had marked every tin and stacked them on the right shelf . He was on the run now . After clearing away the empty cartons , he strode to the employees ' area behind the imported gourmet food section . Divesting himself of his soiled apron , he went into the bathroom . He doused water on his hair , washed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he combed back his wavy , dark brown , longish hair . Toweling his face and hands dry , he studied himself in the mirror . On thcie rare occasions , Malone always spruced himself up as though he might have a chance encounter with Sharon Fields . If it happened , he mated to look his best . The reflection in the mirror showed him whatNSharon Fields would see : the full head of hair , the broad brow of a creator , soulful brown eyes , straight nose , friendly mouth , a well-defined jaw marred only by an unaccountable pimple , sturdy neck with a visible Adam 's apple . And he appeared taller than his five feet ten inches because he was slender . Satisfied , hitching up his blue knit trousers , Malone took his cord jacket off the hanger , and went rapidly through the store , through the automatically opening glass doors , and into the market 's parking lot . He tried to recall where he had left his used foreign compact car , a green MG , and then he spotted it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he strode toward the car , there was a honking from off to one side , followed by a feminine voice calling out , " Hey , Adam ! " He slowed , trying to locate who was paging him , and saw the girl waving from the driver 's window of her Volkswagen . Veering toward her , he could make out that it was Plum again . She was a plain girl , nice and admiring , who was a regular customer in the market . They often talked in the store when she was shopping . She was a teller in a neighborhoodbank . He supposed that she was around thirty . She lived alone , and Malone knew that she had a crush on him . She liked his diffident manner and the fact that he was brainy . She had never met an author before and she was fascinated to know one at last . Several times , she had hinted that it would be nice to have him to her apartment for drinks and dinner , but he had never picked her up on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed with her , but somehow he had never been inspired to follow through . " Hi , Plum , " he greeted her , when he reached her car . " What gives ? " " If you want me to be honest , I 've been waiting for you for the last fifteen minutes . A bag boy told me what time you were getting off . I 'll tell you what it 's all about . I hope you wo n't think me too forward  --  " Immediately , Malone felt uncomfortable . " Of course not , Plum . " " Good . Anyway , someone in the bank  --  actually the lady who heads our escrow department  --  she 's giving a party tonight . I think it 's her boyfriend 's birthday or something . She 's having a late buffet dinner tonight , and she invited me and asked me to bring someone . So I tried to think of someone I 'd really like to be with and I thought of you right away . " Plum eyed him hopefully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other plans for the evening . " Embarrassed , Malone wondered how to let her down nicely . She was a decent person , and Malone , who was incapable of hurting anyone , found an invitation like this difficult to handle . Should he change his59plans ? Plum did absolutely nothing to him . She was zilch to him . Weighingan evening with her against an evening with Sharon Fields , well , there simply was no choice . " I really am sorry , Plum , " he said , " but I 've made other plans . I was just on my way to another engagement . If I 'd known a little in advance , well  --  " Ile shrugged helplessly , and oddly she shrugged , too . " C'est la guerre , " she said . " Maybe next time . " " Sure , " he said . " Take care of yourself . " Awkwardly , he backed away , then turned and left her . Once in his MG , he checked his watch . He 'd barely make it . Starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on Olympic toward Fairfax Avenue , he realized that he really had not lied to Plum . He did have plans , and a fully booked evening ahead . First , of course , the premiere and one more glimpse of Sharon Fields , the light of his life . He had seen her in person only twice before , and both times from some distance . Three years ago , he had observed her entering the Century Plaza Hotel for a charity ball . Early last year , as she hastily left a television station after being featured on a network star-studded variety show , he had viewed her from across the street because the police had blocked off the sidewalk . Tonight , he expected a closer view of the one he considered the only female on earth . Beside her , all women were like boys . After that , there was another engagement to be kept . He was not unmindful of the promise that he had given the three gentlemen  --  Shively , Yost , Brunner  --  in their private booth in the Lantern Bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he remembered his words almost verbatim  --  he had said : If any of you should have a change of heart  --  want to find out how we can really do it  --  I 'll be right loge tomorrow , same place , same time . It was risky bringing strangers into his scheme , but he had always known , ever since first conceiving the idea of picking up Sharon Fields , that he could not attempt it alone . It required a collaborator , possibly several . In a complex undertaking such as this , there was safety in nnnihcrs. " et , he had never once spoken to another soul about his scheme . He had never foisted anyone else . If he confided in the wrong person , and was misunderstood , lie could be seriously hassled by the police . What then bud prompted liini impulsively , boldly to confide his projected caper to three iiisiblote strangers last night ? ' I wit , rc.isous came to mind . One was an inner reason and personal . 1 lewas sick of living and reliving his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the point where he wanted to act out his wish , and felt that it could be done . The outer reason had been accidental . Three men at a bar , upon viewing Sharon Fields on television , had spontaneously , unanimously expressed a desire for her , and two of them had actually admitted in public that they would give up anything and risk anything to possess her . They had voiced , those strangers , what had been secreted in his own head so long . Instantly , he had seen them as brother musketeers , and himself as their D'Artagnan  --  all for one and one for all  --  and everyone for Sharon Fields . And so , taking the cue , he had stepped over the line , broken his silence , confided his most private dream to someone else . That they had rejected him , after a first hearing , was understandable . They were men , like most men , who were not used to believing an impossibledream could become a possible reality by direct action . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , if their growing frustrations were at the bursting point , they might be ready to reconsider , to call on him at the bar tonight , to enlist in his cause and to undertake the adventurous mission side by side with him . And if not , Malone told himself , no loss . He would still have his dream . He would wait , he would watch , and someday , somewhere , he would find another Byron romantic enough to join him in his quest for Sharon Fields . He turned his car into Fairfax and sped toward Hollywood Boulevard . Ile had parked on a side street , three blocks from Grauman 's Chinese Theatre , and half walking , half loping , he had gone toward the mass of activity . The klieg lights beamed their bright streamers toward the heavens , and it was toward the source of those lights that Malone propelled himself , blindly and mothlike . Short of breath , he came upon the congested area . He was only five minutes late , and the star-laden , chauffeured limousines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the theater 's forecourt were jam-packed bleachers filled with shrill and cheering fans . Crowds were thick in sidewalk passages between the theater and bleachers , and onlookers , standing five and six deep , were cordoned off from the boulevard by police . Malone found himself behind one segment of the spectator mob , with no clear view of the arriving limousines let alone the ceremonies in the theater forecourt . Then , remembering a ruse that had once worked successfully for him on another occasion , he pulled his membership card to the Authors Guild of America out of his wallet , held it high above his head , and began squeezing between jostling fans shouting , " Press ! Let me through  --  I 'm with the press ! " Conditioned reflex was instantaneous . Like Pavlov 's dogs , the plebeians responded , spectators crunching aside respectfully to make way for the Fourth Estate . It was an exhausting journey , but it brought him up to the first row behind the ropes , a fairly good vantage point from which he could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they went toward the hotly lighted square in the theater forecourt where two television cameras and Sky Hubbard were interviewing the celebrities before they entered the movie house . Straining for an even better view , Malone pushed against the man beside him , almost unbalancing him . The man straightened , turning upon Malone angrily . " Quit shoving , will you ? Who in the hell do you think you are ? " Malone recognized the rangy spectator at once . " Shively ! " he exclaimed . " What a surprise  --  " Shively squinted , remembered , and his anger faded . " It 's you . Hey , how about that . Ai n't that a coincidence . " Above the noise , Malone tried to make himself heard . " You 're the last person I expected to see here . How come ? " Shively bent down , hoarsely whispering in Malone 's ear . " Same reason you 're here , kid . To have myself a firsthand look at a prime cut of ass . Guess you got me interested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't be disappointed . " Malone looked off , worriedly . " Has she arrived yet ? " " Not yet . Should be here any minute . " They both turned their attention to the series of long , sleek automobilesarriving , a Cadillac limousine , a Jaguar , a chauffeur-driven LincolnContinental , each one delivering attractive young women and their formally attired escorts , the elite of the film industry . One arrival , who wore no makeup on her freckled face and looked like she 'd just got out of bed , drew a spattering of applause . Malone heard her identified as Joan Dever , and vaguely recalled that she was one of the new-style naturalistic actresses who had received a fair amount of publicity for bearing children out of wedlock . Suddenly , to the accompaniment of a rising buzz of anticipation in62the bleachers , a magnificent maroon Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible drew up at the curb . Excitedly , Malone tugged at Shively 's arm . " She 's here . That 's her car . " The theater doorman had opened the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , natty man , perhaps in his late forties , stepped out , blinked ruefully at the mass of faces and the dazzling lights . " Her personal manager , " announced Malone with awe . " Felix Zigman . He handles all her personal affairs . " Zigman had reached inside the back of the Rolls to assist someone , and gradually , almost in slow motion , she emerged , first the bejeweled hand , the bare arm , the slim foot and classic leg , then the long , loose blonde hair , then the familiar breathtaking profile , the shimmering protrusionof the famous bosom , then the sensuous torso . She had fully emerged from the car , and was standing erect , the green eyes and the half-parted moist lips smiling to acknowledge the growing clamor and applause building to a crescendo of cheering and shouting . " Sharon ! Sharon ! Sharon ! " came the tumultuous cry from hundreds of throats . Regally , an ermine stole around her shoulders , a body-hugging sequined dress slit up the side glittering with every movement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunderous reception with the briefest curl of a smile . Mesmerized by her proximity  --  he had never been this close to her , only thirty feet away from her  --  Malone was momentarily rendered speechless . Here she was in full dimension , unfiltered by a camera lens . His shining eyes stayed on her as she made one of her typically theatrical gestures . She freed the fur stole from her shoulders , tossed it to Zigman , and now unencumbered , she revealed her low-cut gown , the deep cleft between her breasts , her smooth shoulders and bare back . Straightening , thrusting her breasts forward until they strained against the sequined dress , she turned gracefully in one direction , then the other , lifting one ann high in further recognition of the continuing ovation from her worshipfulfans . Now , languorously , her face set in an expression of orgasmic bliss , she began her renowned walk from the curb toward the television cameras in the theater 's forecourt . It was a sinuous , slithering walk , her buttocks undulating gently beneath the tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transforming the outer garment into female flesh . " She  --  she does n't wear anything underneath , you know , " gasped Malone . " Just like Harlow and Marilyn Monroe . " Soon she was lost in an ambush of photographers , their bulbs lightingup the circle like a Christmas tree . Once more , the sex goddess was briefly visible , replying to sonic questions being asked by Sky Hubbard for national television coverage . Then , one more wave of the hand to the chanting ; admirers beyond , and she disappeared into the cavern of ( : aaaanava 's Chinese Theatre . Shively and Malone looked at one another wordlessly . Malone found his voice . " What did you think ? " Shively shook his head . " Je-sus , I 've seen a lot of stuff in my day , but never a chassis like that . How could God make tits and an ass like that all for one girl ? " " Site 's flawless , " intoned Malone solemnly . " Let 's go , " said Shively . " Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " " I agree , " said Malone . Others also appeared to agree , for much of the crowd was beginning to disperse , drift away . Shively and Malone retreated slowly through the remaining spectators , both lost in thought . Abruptly , Shively stopped , pointing ahead . " Lookit there . Are n't those the guys we were with last night ? " Malone peered ahead , and in an open space on the sidewalk before an ice cream parlor , were Howard Yost and Leo Brunner , engrossed in conversation . " Why , yes , they 're the same ones , " said Malone . " Well , there 's a surprise , and to me it looks like a reunion , " said Shively . " Let 's see what they 're up to . " In a moment , the four were together , Yost and Brunner sheepishly explaining that they had had some free time tonight and thought they 'd come by to see what a real glamour premiere looked like . " Crap , " said Shively , cheerfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a damn about seeing the premiere . We came here to see for ourselvesif she was what everyone said she was , the greatest-looking piece on God 's earth . " Yost gave off a booming laugh . " Guess we ca n't pull any wool over your eyes , Shively . I 'll confess . I had to see if she was for real . She sure is . " " You bet your ass she is , " said Shively . " All I could think of when she yanked off that fur and started walking was what it would be like to have that piece in the hay , banging her . All I can say , gentlemen , is what I said last night in the bar . Only now I 'd double it in spades . I 'd give up everything I have or could ever have for just one night  --  mind you  --  just one night with that gorgeous broad . " " Ditto and amen , " said Yost. 64Brunner smiled weakly , and bobbed his head . Shively poked a forefinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not kid ourselves . We owe our being here to our pal , to Malone , nobody else . He turned us on to this Sharon Fields . He got us worked up by the possibility of actually getting our hands on her , having her for ourselves . " He studied Malone . " You still feel that way , kid ? " " What way ? " " That we could get to meet this Sharon Fields in person ? " " Certainly , " said Malone . " Nothing 's changed . I 've never doubted it for a moment . I told you so last night , and I 'll repeat it . If you want to get to know her , you can do it  --  we can all do it  --  by cooperating and following my plan . " Shively shrugged at the others . " What 's to lose ? I 've had hot nuts for twenty-four hours just thinking of this Sharon Fields . I want to know if it 's being wasted over nothing . Should we try to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making some sense ? " Yost snorted . " I 'll go along on anything tonight , just for the laughs . What about you , Brunner ? " " I 'm at liberty for a few hours . " " Great , " said Shively . He placed an arm around Malone 's shoulders . " Okay , big brain , let 's the , four of us get better acquainted . And maybe talk a little more about what you have in mind . Know any place near here where we can have a drink in private ? " They had piled into Yost 's roomy Buick , and because they felt reckless and expansive , they had agreed to go to the bar of the Hollywood Brown Derby on Vine Street . While the adjacent restaurant room was filled and noisy , the Derby bar was relatively quiet and sparsely occupied . They had little trouble finding a comfortable booth that isolated them from the handful of customers who were present . After ordering and being served their drinks , there was an awkward interval of silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malone was yet ready to entertain his improbable fantasy . Finally , it was Kyle Shively , squinting about the expensive celebrity watering hole , who launched the conversation that led into what Malone was quickly learning was the mechanic 's favorite topic . " First time I 've ever been in this fancy joint , " admitted Shively . " Now I know why I65steered clear . Did you see what they charge for one lousy weak drink ? You got to be Onassis or Rockefeller to come to places like this . Anybody who says there 's no caste system in this so-called democracy is just full of crap . " With that , he was off into a recounting of the injustice done to him today , the way Mrs. Bishop had snubbed him , had told him plain out he was n't good enough for her , when in fact he had more to offer her than her husband or any of their rich friends . " The only thing I did n't have to offer , " said Shively , " was the fact that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long cock does n't count when you got a short bankroll . That kind of discrimination eats my guts out . It 's a crime , that 's what . And like I 'm always saying , there 's no way to close the gap and be equal , because the rich keep getting richer . " " Indeed they do , Mr. Shively , " Leo Brunner said . Pontifically , he unhookedhis spectacles , began wiping them with the end of his napkin , as he recited the facts of life . " In one recent year , there were five persons in this country who made more than five million dollars each but who did n't pay so much as a nickel in income tax . In that same period , there was an oilman with an income of twenty-six million dollars in twelve months who legally managed to pay no income tax at all . In fact , in a single year United States Steel made a profit of one hundred and fiftyfourmillion dollars and paid not one red cent in taxes . Because of legal tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saved from taxation by wealthy individuals or corporations , and to make up for it , each family in the United States is penalized roughly one thousand dollars annually . Mind you , all of this in a nation where four out of ten persons dwell in deprivation or poverty . I am anything but a radical , gentlemen . In fact , I am quite conservative in most matters , including fiscal policy . I subscribe without reservation to the free-enterprise system . But there is grievous inequity in our tax structure . " Having delivered his monologue , Brunner was left like a gas balloon which had just lost all its helium . He sagged back , seemingly emptied and smaller . " You tell ' em , my friend , " said Shively , pleased to have an expert 's corroboration . " Exactly what I 've been saying right along . " " Well , nobody 's denying that , " said Yost . He massaged a florid cheek thoughtfully . " Although , I always figured everyone had a chance to make it if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of big shots who were n't born rich . I mean , hell , I was n't born rich and I almost had ft made . Alter I was picked for the second A11-American football team46my senior year at Cal , all kinds of doors opened to me . To certain people up there , I was somebody . " " So why are n't you somebody now ? " said Shively . " What happened on the way to the bank ? " Yost appeared genuinely confused . " I do n't know , I really do n't . I guess you got to strike while the iron is hot , and I did n't strike fast enough or hard enough . Because after that , time passes , and people forget , forget who you were , what you did . Then new young hotshots come along , with fresher reputations , and you 're kind of forgotten , as if you 're old hat . A lot of the young marrieds I try to get as clients , why , they 've never even heard of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . I could tell you something that happened to me a few hours ago . I do n't suppose I should tell you , because it 's a little embarrassing , makes me look like a fool . " Adam Malone , who had been sipping his wine and listening , spoke up for the first time . " You can trust us , Mr. Yost , " he said gently . " I think all of us have an understanding that whatever we say to each other will be held in strictest confidence . " " Yeah , " said Shively . Haltingly , eyes on his Scotch , Howard Yost shed his extroversion , his bluff facade , became almost real , as he related his visit to the Livingston home , and how he had been distracted and ignored by their daughter Gale , and how he had found no comfort for his hurt feelings of rebuff in his own household . " Just like I 've been trying to explain , " said Shively . " Mind you , I 'm not putting my wife down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame for my own failures . I mean , she has problems of her own to contend with . It 's just that at one point in your life you can get backed into a corner , and there 's nowhere to turn , no way to get out of the pressure cooker . " Malone nodded with understanding , and said quietly , " Most men lead lives of quiet desperation . I did n't make that up . I 'm lifting it from ' I ' horeau . " Once more , Brunner seemed to emerge from the woodwork . " Yes , ' I horeau 's remark was a perceptive one . I suppose , well , I 'm assuming that one way or another , it applies to each one of us here . You mentioned your marriage , Mr. Yost . I 'd say I 'm probably the oldest one present  --  I 'm going to be fifty-three on my next birthday  --  and I guess I 've been married the longest time . Thirty years to one woman , if you wish to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage . When I look at other men 's mates , I often think I should count my blessings . Yet , I often67wonder whether man was meant for monogamy . All of the excitement and discovery in the early years of marriage inevitably tends to fade with the passage of time . The partners become too familiar . Passion recedes . The relationship becomes almost that of  --  of brother and sister , or something similar . And if , added to that , one 's work becomes wearisome , routine , with little hope for improvement , a man becomes more and more disappointed and demoralized . He is left with too few options . He has no opportunity for change or variety . He is bereft of hope . It 's not fair , somehow . " Shively seemed uncomprehending . " Well , Leo , if I can call you that , I ai n't ever been married , so I do n't know much about how that works . But I ca n't see why you ca n't get a piece of ass on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighten things up . Most married guys I know do . " Brunner shrugged . " It is not that easy for everyone , Kyle . We 're not all equally assertive or even attractive to women . I would find it  --  it very difficult to cheat . Perhaps it is my guilt apparatus that inhibits me . " " You mean you never cheated , not once , on your old lady ? " asked Shively . Brunner picked at his paper napkin , hesitant to reply . At last , he put the tattered napkin aside and spoke up . " Well , since we speak in confidence , I  --  I was unfaithful to Thelma twice , on two occasions in our marriage . The first time , well , actually it was n't my fault . It was sort of an accident . It was about ten years ago , and I had this attractive young secretary , and we were working late . It was during tax season when the work load is the heaviest . We finished past midnight , and she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I brought a bottle . I hope you 'll celebrate the occasion with me . ' So to give ourselves a lift , and to celebrate , we began drinking . I 'm afraid I got very drunk . All I can remember is there we were on the couch and she had her  --  her dress up and I was doing it to her . It was incredible . It was just that once . She left me shortly after for a better-paying job . " limuter hesitated , glanced at the others , blushing . " I  --  i guess that does not sound like much . On the second occasion  --  well , I confess , it was only last year  --  I happened to come across a copy of one of those very shocking underground newspapers . You know the ones ? " . " Read them every week , " said Malone . ' ' Well , this was new to me . Those ads . Massage parlors , whatnot . Well , these was this one ad from a place on Melrose Avenue saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one of several beautiful68girls pose for you nude . It so happens my hobby is taking Polaroid pictures . So one night , when Thelma was out of the city to visit an ailing relative , I took my camera and I went to this address in the ad . ' Well , I paid and they sent me into a private room with this attractive-looking model . She could not have been more than twenty . She was very matterof-fact . She removed her dress  --  her dress and panties  --  and lay down on the thick rug and told me to tell her how to pose . I was nonplussed . I was too  --  too stimulated even to set my camera . She saw what was happening , and she was amused and very nice . She said something like Come here and lie down beside me . You really did n't come here to take pictures , did you ? ' I did what she told me to do . Then she opened my fly and got over on top of me and we did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the risk of sounding naive to you , I had never done it that way . I mean , with positions reversed . It was most stimulating . " " If it was enjoyable , " said Malone , " why did n't you go back for more ? " " I do n't know . I guess I was ashamed , a man my age  --  a married man , at that . It did n't seem right . " Shively swallowed the last of his drink . " Well , I just ca n't see it , Leo , I do n't dig the going-without bit . What are you saving it for ? Do n't you have a desire to get out and have more fun ? " Brunner nodded his head vigorously . " I certainly do have the desire to indulge in such pleasures . I suppose I 'm held back by several factors . It is one thing to desire , and another thing to act out your desires . I suppose I was raised differently , in a different time , when sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithfulness , in men was extolled . In that respect , I am a victim of my past . Many men my age are . We 're psychological cripples . Furthermore , I 'm always worried that a younger woman might not want me , might even laugh at me . But desire  --  yes , Kyle , I have desire . " " I guess it 's just a little easier for me , " said Yost . " Being in my field , I mean . I 'm always making house calls on prospective clients . Some of them are divorcees or young widows . Every once in a while I score . I get an invitation to mix business with pleasure . Not bad . " He laughed . " Wow , there have been a few unforgettable ones . But I 'll tell you , to be perfectly honest , it can sometimes become too complicated . Sometimes they want to see you regularly , and that 's not easy for a family man . Frankly , to be right up front with you fellows , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You pay , you get , you go . " " You mean hookers and call girls ? " asked Malone . " Sure thing , my friend . I 'm lucky one way . I go to at least one insuranceconvention a year , sometimes two . State and national . Last year we69had our convention at the Fontainebleau in Miami Beach . The place was swarming with talent . There was one hooker in particular , a classy Cuban beauty , maybe twenty-nine , thirty , picked her up in the Poodle Bar . One hundred for all night . But those are the nights that make life worthwhile . That 's living like the other half lives . " Shively grimaced . " Each to his own , Howie . I 'm not knocking what anybody else does to get it . Speaking only for me , I 'm against paying for it . Why pay , when there 's so much snatch around begging for it ? What do you say to that , Malone ? For our chairman you 're not being very communicative . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , " said Malone . " Women seem to be intrigued by anyone creative . When I 'm in the mood , I seem to have no trouble finding someone available . Actually  --  " " What have you written ? " Yost interrupted . " Have I ever read anythingby you ? " Malone smiled shyly . " It 's unlikely you have . I 've had nothing importantpublished , neither books nor stories in widely circulated publications . Until now , my work has appeared in only the smaller periodicals , literary quarterlies . They pay with prestige , but you ca n't eat on prestige . So I 'm forced to take side jobs , until I hit it big one day . " " What kind of side jobs ? " ' inquired Brunner . " I 'm not very particular . Any job that gives me bread , and enough time to continue writing , satisfies me . I started out as a substitute grammar school teacher . But it was confining and unrewarding . For about a year I worked as a clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I got tired of looking up women 's skirts . " " Say , man , you must be queer , " said Shively . Malone smiled . " No , I 'm straight enough . Anyway , this past year I 've been doing part-time work as a stacker in a supermarket on Olympic . Mindless work . No concentration necessary . So it gives me plenty of time to think out my stories while earning some bread . And , incidentally , being employed in a market is a great way to meet lots of single girls who live in the neighborhood . They 're pretty open to action , too , the way Kyle Shively says . What with women 's lib , and all that , they 're as aggressive as men . They 'll come up to you and say , What about it , fellow ? ' Just like that . " " Well , what about it , fellow ? " repeated Shively . " What does that mean ? " " It means what it says it means . It means what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get together tonight . Look , kid , hashing over past conquests is past business . Done and over with . I found out70long ago that getting chicks to ball three or four times a week is no big deal . I learned the main lesson a long time ago . The chicks want it as much as the men do . If you 're not picky  --  and I 'm not  --  hell , if it moves and it 's gash , I 'll go for it  --  then they 're all pushovers . But that 's not why I came here tonight . Do you know why I came here ? " " I have an idea , " said Malone evenly . " It 's not to discuss the pushovers and roundheels . Those sex-starved bimbos who pass through the station every day  --  this one here a secretary , that one there a waitress , another one a shop clerk  --  that 's ordinary gash . I 'm here to talk not of what I 've got but what I 'm being deprived of because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm talking about the high-class stuff that 's supposed to be too good for Kyle Shively . I 'm talking about super-gash . " He paused meaningfully . " Like maybe Sharon Fields . Right ? " " Right , " said Malone . " I saw her at the premiere tonight . My dick went a mile high . That 's what I want to get into . That 's what I want to bang . You heard me say I 'd give up my left arm , my middle arm , anything in the world , for one shot at a piece like that . I want to slip it to somebody like Sharon Fields . Now , you 're the big brain who said it was easy . You had me half convincedlast night . Then you blew it . But I 've had second thoughts , see ? I 'm wide open to being convinced . Only I do n't want you to bull me . " " I have no reason to bull you , Shively . " " Then answer me one thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . I accept that you 're a nut on this broad and know a lot about her . I even accept the possibility that you got a plan to meet her that could work . So far , so good . But you tell me one thing . If you 've had this workable plan so long , how come you ai n't never used it , put it in action for yourself ? How come you never made it yourself with this Sharon Fields ? " Now they all waited for Adam Malone 's reply . He began to speak slowly , measuring his words . " In the beginning , I had a less daring plan , one that I felt I could manage . Yes , I did try to meet her by following my original plan . I put it together this way . I 'm a writer . Lots of writers are doing articles about Sharon Fields . They must be meeting and interviewing her to do them . So , even though fan magazineswere not the sort of outlets I wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself just for the opportunity to see Sharon Fields . So I concocted some ideas for stories about her , various angles , and went to Aurora Films to meet her . I never got nearer to her than their publicity department . Apparently , I was n't well enough known71to them , I did n't have credits enough , to be granted an interview . Furthermore , they said that she was now so famous , everyone on earth wanted time with her , and she was simply too busy to make that much time available . So they gave me all kinds of canned publicity material and photographs and sent me away saying that would give me plenty of material to work from . Well , then I kept thinking . From knowing so much about her , knowing her so well , even better than girls I 've gone steady with and slept with , I knew that once I 'd found a way to meet her , I 'd make it with her . She 'd want to love me the way I 've always wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out my second and more daring plan , my present plan . " IIc could see that Shively was definitely more responsive but still not entirely satisfied . " Okay , so how come you never tried to do what you told us could be done , go out and pick her up and get the chance to talk her into some sex ? " " Because it was simply too complex an undertaking for one person to tackle alone . Being who she is makes her less accessible than most women . There are other complications , as well , but not a single obstacle that I have not already faced and overcome on paper . It takes several people , several skills , an organization of men such as ourselves . " He paused . " Since we 're all being honest tonight , I 'll tell you I was held back by another reason , not dissimilar to Leo Brunner 's own when he spoke of women . I 'm good at creating things , dreaming up ideas and plans . I 'm not good at carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action . So I always looked forward to finding some others to help me , to implement my ideas . " Shively kept his eyes on Malone . " Maybe you found what you always wanted  --  in me and Yost and even Brunner . " " I can only hope so . " " Okay , no more jerking off , kid . From now on , I want to be practical . No games . I can see getting our hands on her . That part I can see . 1110 its what 's after that  --  what follows  --  that 's what I want to be sure of , Suppose we hung together , the four of us , worked it out , got our hands on her . What absolute proof have you got that we could make it with her , that she would n't object , that she 'd put out for us ? Answer me that and 1 ' 11 play on your team . " " I i an . uo ' . wer you that to your complete satisfaction , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once we confront her , she 'll be tvmplrlcl ' cooperative . " " I.ikr they say , I 'm from Missouri  --  vou got to show me . " " Proof ? " 72 " Proof . " " I 'll show you , I 'll show you every bit of it , " said Malone firmly . " Not here . It 's up in my apartment for you to see . Once you see it , you 'll have no more doubts . I 'm positive you 'll be ready to go ahead with me . What about coming to my apartment tomorrow night after dinner ? Say eight o'clock . " Shively laid his palms flat on the table . " Far as I 'm concerned , you got yourself a deal . " He looked at the other two . " You want in or not ? " Yost frowned . " Sure I want in . Who would n't , considering what we 're talking about ? I 'll be there . Just to learn what he 's got in mind ... . Malone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go along all the way . " Now the others were waiting for Brunner . The older man 's eyes blinked steadily behind his glasses . Finally , he spoke , " I  --  I do n't know . I guess I 've come this far , so why not a little further ? " Shively grinned widely . " Unanimous . That 's the way I like it . " " Me too , " said Malone , pleased . " It should be our motto . All for one and one for all . " " Yeah , not bad , " said Shively . " Okay , Malone , give us your address . We 'll be there , for sure . We 'll call it the first official meeting of the Let's-Ball-Sharon-Fields Society . " Malone winced , then quickly looked around to see whether they had been overheard . They had not been . He bent closer to the others . " I think from now on we 'd better be very careful , " he whispered . " If this is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely secret . " Shively formed a circle with his thumb and forefinger . " Okay , sworn in blood , " he promised . " From now on , everything is secret . Because I got a feeling in my crotch that this is going to happen . " " Oh , it 's going to happen , " said Malone softly . " And since it 's going to , I 'd suggest another name for our group , something very innocent  --  " " Like what ? " asked Shively . " Like  --  like  --  The Fan Club . " " Yeah , " said Shively , eyes glowing . " That 's great . That 's what we are , companeros . From now on we 're The Fan Club . " 733 . IT WAS WEDNESDAY EVENING . It was ten minutes after eight o'clock . It was the moment that Adam Malone had dreamt of for a year . From the tray holding bottles , glasses , ice cubes atop his television set , Malone poured and passed out drinks , and felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his three new friends who were relaxing in his bachelor apartment in Santa Monica . There was Kyle Shively slouched back in the cracked brown leather chair , a leg slung over one arm of the chair that Malone had acquired at a Salvation Army store . There was Leo Brunner seated stiffly and troubledin a corner of the convertible daybed . There was Howard Yost , tieless , going around the room examining the photographs and posters of Sharon Fields that papered two of the walls . " Hey , Adam , " the insurance salesman called out , " you sure are into Sharon Fields , all right . I 've never seen a collection like this anywhere . Your apartment looks like a pinup museum . Where 'd you get this stuff ? " " From Aurora Films , from other studios that Sharon worked at , " said Malone . " Some of it I bought in secondhand stores that specialize in cinema art . Some of it I got in trades with other movie buffs . Yes , I guess it 's one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before one six-sheet and whistled . " Look at this one . Look at her , will you ? " He indicated the larger-than-life photograph of Sharon Fields standing , legs apart , one hand on her hips , the other holding a crumpled dress at her side , wearing nothing more than a flimsy white bra and skintight panties , winking audaciously out at her unseen audience . " Boy , would n't you like to have that in your arms just the way she is there ? " Malone turned away from the television set , wormed between his battered legal-sized file cabinet and dining table , and joined Yost in admiring the poster . " One of my prizes , " said Malone . " It was used to advertise Are You Decent ? That 's the comedy Sharon made five years ago where she plays a prissy self-appointed censor determined to expose and ruin a producer of pornographic girly shows who has a road company playing throughout New England . To expose this producer , Sharon has to retold she 's a burlesque stripper and join the producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film , the first time she takes it off . Do you remember the picture ? " 74 " How could I forget ? " said Yost , still enjoying the oversized reproductionof Sharon Fields . " And you say you 've got more ? " Malone patted the file cabinet proudly . " Four drawers here filled with everything there is to know about Sharon . It 's all carefully filed  --  publicityreleases , newspaper and magazine clippings , tapes of radio and television interviews , still pictures , you name it . And that 's not counting my own notes . " Shively swung his leg off the arm of the leather chair . " You two , stop the drooling and time wasting and let 's get down to business . You , Adam , you were going to give us a complete fill-in on this chick . So let 's get going . " " I was just about to do it , " said Malone . He opened the top file drawer and extracted three folders , as Yost went to sit on the daybed next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular dining-room table , opened the folders , spread them out , began sorting and scanning the material . At last , he shifted around to face the others . " Here 's what we 're dealing with . Sharon Fields . The condensed version . She was born twenty-eight years ago on a plantation-type farm outside Logan , West Virginia . Good family , genteel aristocrats . Her father was a gentleman and a Georgiabornlawyer . She had her primary education at Mrs. Gussett 's Finishing School in Maryland . A distinguished school . Then attended Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania . Her major was psychology , and her minor was theater arts . At college , she played Mrs. Erlynne in Lady Windermere'sFan by Oscar Wilde , and Wendy in Barrie 's Peter Pan . Her third year in college , without her parents ' knowledge , she entered a beauty contest and was declared the winner , and part of her prize was a trip to New York to make a television commercial for a sweater manufacturer . The commercial proved so successful that Sharon was persuaded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television . On the side , she took lessons in the Stanislaysky method from a private drama coach . One day , along with some other young actresses , she modeled swimming suits at a charity function being held at the Plaza . A Hollywoodagent happened to be on hand with his wife . Instantly , he saw the possibility of making Sharon Fields a star . He arranged for a screen test . The studio signed her to a year 's contract at a minimum salary . She was brought to Hollywood , where she was given a bit part in a suspense film called Hotel for Terror . She played a gangster 's bride . She was in only two scenes . You know the rest . That small part attracted more fan mail , mostly from men , than any established star had ever drawn . Immediately , Sharon was signed to a long-term contract . And now , twentythreepictures later , she is the greatest female star and sex symbol in motion-picture history . " Malone paused to catch his breath , and to rummage through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As to some of the movies she 's  --  " " Enough of that , " Shively interrupted . " You do n't have to sell us on how big she is . We 're not dummies . We know . We even saw for ourselveslast night . That 's not why we 're here . For me , I want to know more about that chick 's sex life . She 's got to have a cunt big as a landing barge . " " IIcr sex life ? " said Malone . " Sure . Her relationships with men have been public property . It 's one of the great things about Sharon . She has nothing to hide . She 's frank about everything she does or has ever done . About men , well , she 's been married twice , both times when she was a kid , and both times quickies . The first time it was a college boy , who was drafted right after he graduated , which was a month after he married her . He was sent to Vietnam and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent agent who discovered her  --  Halden was his name . He 'd got rid of his first wife for Sharon , but after they got to Hollywood , they were divorced . I think that one lasted only six months . " Yost snickered . " At least we know she 's not a virgin . " " Marriage is not necessarily evidence of loss of virginity , " said Brunner seriously . " Well , I do n't think we have to worry about that , " said Malone . " While I would hardly call our girl promiscuous , I will say that she has always performed in real life the way she felt , without any inhibition whatsoever . She 's always been a hedonist . She 's never repressed her sexual needs . She 's always satisfied them . You 've read about her love affairs on the front pages , her proclivity for bedding down with headIiiu'rs . ' There are at least a half-dozen scandalous affairs that were heavily publicized . There were three with famous actors , two of whom were cci ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light-heavyweight champion. ' 1'Iien that billionaire socialite from Boston . Then  --  you remember  - -  the handsome senator from the Midwest . " " Yes , " said Brunner . " His wife divorced him , and smeared him when he ran for reelection . " " And her last afair  --  I 'm presuming it was an affair  --  with Roger Clay , fhe Ilrrtish actor , " said Malone . " She was supposed to marry him recentlyApp ; urntly they had a fight , and he went hack to London . She 's going to I isulon herself on June twenty fourth  --  that 's in about seven week , * m so but I do n't think it 's to see him . Anyway , we can safelyassume that she 's not active sexually right now . And we can also assume that she likes to be sexually active . " Shively stirred . " Says who ? " " It 's general knowledge , " Malone replied . " She makes no secret of it . I read one psychiatrist 's analysis of Sharon 's attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest childhood , despite her exemplary background , for whatever reasons , she 's always lacked confidence , always felt insecure , as if she did n't belong . One way of belonging , of being accepted by others , was to see that she was desired by men . It 's the way one famous photographer put it about Marilyn Monroe . When she faced a man she did n't know , she felt safe and secure only when she knew the man desired her . So everything in her life was geared to provide this feeling . The only way she knew to get herself accepted was to make herself desired . It even worked with the camera . She would try to seduce a camera as if it were a human being . ' That 's Sharon Fields . " " I 'll be damned , " muttered Yost , rising to refill his glass . " So you see , that 's the kind of person we 're dealing with , " said Malone . " All well and good , " said Yost as he poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us evidence the lady is a swinger . You 've told us she puts out . But you have n't given us one shred of evidence she 'd put out for men like ourselves , men who are n't movie moguls , or handsome actors , or billionaires , or politicians . That 's the evidence we want to hear . " " You bet your ass that 's what we want to hear , " echoed Shively . " Enough beating around the bush , sonny boy . We want to see you put up or shut up , once and for all . " " I was just giving you a backgrounder , filling you in to whet your appetites , " explained Malone . " I have the goods . I promised you proof . Now you can see it . " Without another word , Malone plucked a thick manila folder off the table , stood up , extracted a sheaf of clippings and handed them to Yost , who accepted them and crossed to sit down and read them . Malone passed another sheaf of clippings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clippings to Shively . As the three began to read the clippings , Malone took a position in the center of the room , watching for their reactions and awaiting their verdicts . Presently , unable to contain himself any longer , Malone resumed speaking , even as the others continued to read and half listen to him . " Like I told you before , I 've followed this girl from the start of her career , " Malone said . " I know every nuance of what she says , every subtle77change in her attitudes . You believe me , as the world 's leading Sharonwatcher , there 's nothing that gets by me . So you can take my word when I tell you that I 've detected a drastic change in Sharon Fields during the last year or two . She used to be what you think she is  --  a girl who would accept only the renowned , the rich , the powerful as lovers . But no more of that . Not anymore . With the exception of Roger Clay , she 's changed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . It 's clearly revealed in those candid interviews with her that you 're reading , in the confession articles she 's written herself , in the transcripts of the tapes I 've made of her television and radio talk shows . You can see and hear for yourself . " " Yeah , " murmured Shively , buried in the contents of the folder . " Note how she 's become more frank , more honest , more revealing about her restlessness with her celebrity life and her celebrated lovers . Note how she repudiates her old way  --  " Shively looked up . " Her old way ? Oh , you mean when she used to be a Name-fucker ? " Malone squirmed . " Well , not exactly that but something like that . She 's saying now that because a man has fame because of some talent or other , or has money or has power , that does not mean he 's automaticallythe kind of man she 'd be willing to love or want to give herself to . You can read how she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see  --  it 's so obvious  --  how she 's sick and tired of the effete , intellectual crowd , the materialistic males , the egocentric men who surround her . Most of them are so self-centered that they do n't know how to give . In one place , she quotes Wilson Mizner 's line about that type . Some of the greatest love affairs I 've known involved one actor , unassisted . ' " " Very amusing , " said Brunner with the smallest twitch of a smile . " ' Those vain men who love themselves more than they can love a woman are n't the only ones she 's tired of , " Malone went on . " There are other types in her immediate circle she 's also become tired of . There are many men who want a relationship with her because she is what she is  --  world-renowned as a sex symbol  --  " " Count Inc in as one of them , " interrupted Shively. "  --  and others want the publicity that accrues from being seen in her company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , who ate weak sycophants . She says that she got rid of them all because , for one rtawn or another , they are all incapable of giving her the one thing die wants and needs most from men  --  love -- pure , honest , outgoingMalone , observing the others absorbed in their reading , moved behind Yost , and peered down over his shoulder at a full-page Sunday newspaper supplement interview with Sharon Fields that he was skimming . " Look at that , " Malone said to no one in particular , " the one right here dated only a month ago . Look at the way Sharon lays it on the line . My need is for a man who is aggressive , who will make me feel helpless , who will dominate me , who will make me feel safe and protected . I 'm tired of grown men who are still mother 's boys , who pretend to be cocksurewhen they are frightened and weak inside . I 'm equally tired of overpublicized Casanovas who constantly have to prove their virility by trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no desire other than the desire to reinforce their manhood and improve their batting averages for public consumption . They get phony reputations for being great lovers , when they know absolutely nothing about love . Having a relationship with such a man is like having an affair with a computer . ' " Malone paused , reading ahead . Now both Shively and Brunner were being attentive , and Yost was following the words Malone had read aloud . Malone pointed down at the bottom half of the page . " Look at that paragraph . The interviewer says , It was evident to me that everything Sharon Fields told me was deeply felt and came from sincere conviction . She told me that her attitude toward the opposite sex has done a complete turnabout in recent months . ' " Malone raised his head . " Listen , all of you , listen to the next part . Now he 's quoting Sharon Fields directly . When I meet a man , and he 's interested in me , I expect him to tell me how he feels straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking of a man who happens to desire me , I 'd rather have him take me by force than try to take me by insincere seductive gamesmanship . Another new feeling I have is this  --  I 'm not interested in a man 's Dun and Bradstreet or Who 's Who rating . I 'm interested in the man himself . I do n't give a damn about his looks , his education , his station . What I do give a damn about is what he is inside , his inner qualities , and , of course , his interest in me and his readiness to express that interest , through caring for me as a person as well as caring for me as a sexual creature . More and more , I look for a man who is all man , if you know what I mean , and whose primary interest is to satisfy me as a woman , not only himself , but me , too . I 've opened the door of my heart to this  --  to this willingness to let enter any male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who would risk anything he possesses to have mc , for no reason except that I am me . There 's been a tremendousrevolution taking place in human relationships , and I 've been swept79up by it . There 's a new sexual freedom , equality , openness in the air , and I 'm for it and I want to be part of it . Most men do n't understand what is happening to women , and to a woman like me . But , perhaps a few do , and to them I say  --  I 'm ready , Sharon Fields is ready and waiting . ' " Malone straightened up , and walked toward the center of the room once more , watching the reactions on the faces of his friends . " ' Well , " he said , " well now  --  that 's something , is n't it ? " Yost 's expression made no secret of his reaction . He was impressed . " It sure is something . " He glanced at the article again . " How about that ? Asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clippings aside . " Yeah , no question . " He addressed himself to Yost . " Howie you know what  --  looks like our host here has been leveling with us right along . " Malone beamed . " I told you . It 's just a problem of meeting her . Once we 've met her , she 'll go along . In story after story , she 's trying to tell us that . " Leo Brunner lifted and wagged a finger  --  it looked as if he were trying to tell the teacher that he had to go to the bathroom , but actually he was making an effort to attract Malone 's attention , as well as Yost 's and Shively 's . Alone , he appeared uncertain of what he had read and what he had heard aloud . " Yes , Leo ? " said Malone . Amused , Yost added , " You 're on , Leo . We 're not following Robert 's Rules of Order here . " " Thank you , " said Brunner , formally . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh  --  interest in -- in plain men like ourselves . Taken at face value , this does tend to confirm what Adam has been saying . On the other hand , how can we know she actually said the things we 've been reading ? We all know how the media constantly distort the news , even interviews , through omission or to play up an angle . I  --  I think I can speak firsthand of this , in a modest way . I was once interviewedby our neighborhood weekly on the future of the economy . There was a paragraph in print quoting me , attributing a factual statement to inc . Yet , the reporter added three words that I had never spoken , and those words changed the entire meaning of my statement . So how can we be sure that Miss Fields has been quoted accurately ? " " We can be sure that where there 's so much smoke , there must be fire , " replied Malone , earnestly . " It would be one thing if we were dealingwit Ii two or three interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downs . ' I'hcy have her speaking in a single voice . You do n't believe so many chlicrcnt stories could all be distorted or exaggerated , do you ? " 80 " You have a point there , " admitted Brunner . " So many different interviewers quoting Sharon almost alike , " Malone went on . " It 's got to add up . But even if you did n't trust those stories , what about the transcripts I showed you of radio and television tapings I made of her when she was on the air ? I have the cassettes . You can hear them whenever you like . On those , there 's no reporter standing between her and the public . On those you can hear her own voice speakingdirectly to everyone , and generally saying the same things about her desires and feelings . In my opinion , she 's telling men like us who care for her that we 're the kind of men who interest her . And one quality I find in her constantly is utter frankness . She says what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the room . " And there she 's telling us , well , telling us in effect to come and get her . At least , that 's the way I read it . " Shively came to his feet , tightening his belt . " Yeah , that 's the way I read it , too . " He picked up the clippings , fondled them briefly , and put them down again . He came forward , placed an arm around Malone , and regarded him with admiration . " You know , kid , I did n't mind telling you once before that at first I thought you were some kind of kook who was jerking off . Now , I 'm beginning to see you got something there . It 's all making sense . I 'm ready  --  even if it 's just for the hell of it  --  to go on to the next step . " " The next step ? " repeated Malone . Shively released Malone , looked him in the eye . " You know what I mean . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . What you 've told us up to now is that we 'd start off by picking her up . That ai n't enough to go by . So you better sit down and tell us what would follow . " Shively dropped into the leather chair once more , and Malone drew the torn ottoman into the middle of the semicircle and sat on it . " All right , " he said . " The four of us , we just pick her up one day and take her away . " Brunner shook his head vigorously . " Mr. Yost said it before . I must emphasize it again . That 's kidnapping , a major criminal offense . Do n't make it sound like something else . " " Maybe it could be called kidnapping at the start , and would be kidnappingif we persisted in holding her against her will , " said Malone . " But if she does n't mind once it 's done , then it 's no longer kidnapping . " " What next ? " asked Shively . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , maybe for a weekend . We get to know her intimately . She gets to know us . After that , we  --  well , I guess we sleep with her . " si " And that , I must point out , is rape , " said Brunner , with unexpected firmness . " Not if she gives consent , " replied Malone . " Not if she volunteers to cooperate . That 's not rape . " " But let 's presume she might not enjoy the situation and refuses to cooperate with us , " said Brunner , still unconvinced . " ' That would n't happen . " " But suppose it did ? " " Why , then we 've failed , " said Malone . " We 'd have no choice but to release her . " Brunner seemed satisfied . Shively was on his feet again . " Just one more thing , kid , before I take off , " he said to Malone . " Got to be on the job early in the morning , so I 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thing . You 've been talking in generalities . Nothing solid , know what I mean ? If we 're going to explore this further , we better know exactly what we 're doing . " " You mean details of how to proceed ? " said Malone . " I have the details . Pages and pages of notes on how to carry this off . I could go over them with you whenever you 're free . " " Good , " said Shively . " That 's what I want to get into . How do we do it  --  if we do it ? " He moved to the center of the room . " You guys game for another session ? I mean , where we get down to brass tacks ? " " Name the time and place and I 'll be there , " said Yost . " What about you , Leo ? " Shively asked . Brunner hesitated , then shrugged . " Why not ? " Going to the door , they discussed the time and place . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the following Monday evening , five days from this date . It was also decided to hold the meeting in Leo Brunner 's office on Western Avenue , because Brunner 's wife knew he often worked late on that evening , and furthermore , because the office at night assured them absolute privacy . Disbanding , Malone promised them that they would not be disapIx-intcd . " Once you see my blueprint , you 'll know we 're in business . " It wail not until late the following Monday evening , after having been rlrluved at work , that Adam Malone arrived at the glazed glass door on the third Hoot of the dingy office building on Western Avenue that borethe black lettered legend : Lxo BRUNNFR -- CF.R ' 11r'IEv PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT. vAn imitation-leather portfolio under his arm , Malone opened the door and went inside . The outer cubicle , which apparently served as a reception room and secretarial office , was empty and darkened except for the shaft of light shining through the doorway to the connecting office . Malone could make out Yost 's bulk and Shively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light was partially blocked out as Brunner appeared in the opening between the two rooms . " Who is it ? " Brunner called out . " Is that you , Adam ? " " Nobody but . " Brunner came hurriedly into the darkened room . " We were beginning to worry that you were n't going to show up . We 've all been here for forty-five minutes . " " I 'm sorry . My boss stuck me with some last-minute work . Then I had to get home to pick up my papers . " Brunner shook Malone 's hand . " Well , you 're here . Go right in . I 'd better lock the front door from the inside . We do n't want any unexpectedvisitors . " " We certainly do n't . This meeting has got to be absolutely top secret . " He watched Brunner turn the dead bolt on the door , waited , and with Brunner proceeded into the inner office , greeting and apologizing to the others . Malone headed for the client 's chair across from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the desk . " You have all your papers , so you use the desk , Adam . Just let me clear it . " Busily , he moved his adding machine and ledgers to one side , turned the swivel chair toward Malone , and himself went to the chair across the way . " There 's some cold beer , " said Brunner . Malone shook his head . " No , thanks . I want to concentrate on what I have here . " He began to empty his portfolio of typed notes and several manila folders . What he had assembled had occupied most of his spare time during the past five days . Normally , his precious time before or after going to the market was devoted to developing one of several short stories he had been writing , and outlining a novel he had in mind . But in the last five days his typewriter had been filled only with sheets of paper on which he had described each step of the Sharon Fields mission . He had thought it out , written and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creativework of art . In fact , he had told himself wryly , it was a work of art , a superior one , which had all the ingredients of a perfectly wrought story . Once you suspended disbelief , you were left with abduction , cliff-hangingR.4action , conflict , romance , sex , even a happy ending . Malone could not remember when he had enjoyed a writing project more than his preparation of the steps in the taking of Sharon Fields . Now , his notes and exhibits fanned out on Brunner 's desk , Malone faced his companions . " To begin with , the layout of her estate in Bel Air . It is located behind a gate off a short dead-end street called Levico Way . What you do is turn north off Sunset Boulevard into Stone Canyon Road , and in six or seven minutes you come to Levico Way on your left . I 've scouted the area , and to get a full view of Sharon 's house , you keep driving along Stone Canyon Road , following it high up into the Bel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you reach the end of Stone Canyon at its highest elevation . By looking down , you can see all of Sharon 's property and her house directly below . " " You 've been there ? " asked Brunner , with surprise . " Many times , " Malone acknowledged . " I have here one of those souvenir maps for tourists who want to see where the movie stars live . We 've seen them being sold along Sunset Boulevard . Well , with a red crayon I 've drawn the path to Sharon 's estate and then the path to the elevation from which her estate can be observed . As you 'll see marked on the map , the Bel Air section near and around Sharon 's place is dotted with movie stars ' homes . If you look carefully you 'll see on the way to Sharon Fields ' place the homes owned or once owned by Greer Carson , Ray Milland , Louis B. Mayer , Jeanette MacDonald , Mario Lanza , Alan Ladd , Frank Sinatra . " " Pretty fancy , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you an idea of what we are contending with , here is a photographic layout of Sharon Fields ' mansion , exterior and interior , and of the grounds surrounding the palatial residence . It 's a lrclluva spread . I heard somewhere it 's worth around four hundred and fifty thousand . " Shively whistled . " Nobody lives like that . " " Plenty of people do , " said Malone , " and she 's one of them . It 's a two story house , with twenty-two rooms , and it is what 's called Spanish colonial revival style  --  you 'll see for yourself , red-tiled roof , grilled windows . Ratios , open balconies , carved-wood mantels over the fireplaces , a billiard roan , a private projection room . And in the rear an artificial waterfall rand pavilion with wooden columns supporting a terra cotta owning dust I think her decorator bought or copied from the old John Itunyruure hu rrncla . Here , see for yourself . " Malone mllrl has swivel chair toward the couch , handing the picture14layout to Yost and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk , searching for his step-sheet of the plot and finding it at last . " There 's one thing I want you to look at carefully , " said Malone , " because it 's what concerns us the most . You 'll see that there 's a narrow asphalt road or driveway that leads from the mansion past a small wooded area of poplars , cypresses , palm trees , around a bend to the tall wrought-iron entrance gate . Do you see that ? " Both Yost and Shively nodded , and summoned Brunner to join them . Hastily , Brunner squeezed in on the couch beside the pair , and craned his neck to observe the picture . " Okay , " said Shively , " what about it ? " " That 's where Sharon Fields takes her daily constitutional , " explained Malone . " I know most of her habits , and the one she 's observed religiouslyever since she moved into that house is her morning walk . All sources confirm it . She gets up every morning early , showers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the road to the gate and back again , a daily stroll for air , for exercise , for whatever . Well , I always figured that 's the best place for any outsider to meet her . " " You mean grab her during her walk ? " said Shively . " At the halfway point , at the point where she reaches the gate before turning back . That 's where we could  --  well  --  pick her up , with the best chance of not being seen . It 's usually somewhere between seven and eight in the morning . We 'd be ready , get to her , pick her up . " Yost sat back . " She might resist . Did you ever figure that ? " " Yes , she might , at least at first , because she 'd be frightened , not understand our motive , " agreed Malone . " But I 've even anticipated that . I 'm afraid we 'd have to put her out for a short time . " Brunner 's pale face twitched . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chloroform . Just a small amount . The next step would be to transport her to some safe hideout , some isolated place  --  like an unusedor abandoned bungalow  --  which was removed from any community and far from traffic of any kind . " " Not so easy to find , " said Shively . " You think we can find a place like that ? " " We 'd have to , " said Malone . " Because  --  " " Do n't worry about that part , " Yost interrupted . " Let 's not get hung up on that . I 've got a flash on how we could solve it . We can get into that later . You just go on , Adam . ' What do you see as the next step ? " Malone did not answer at once . He reclined in the swivel chair , trying to visualize fulfillment . He had visualized what followed so many times privately , it was not difficult to conjure up the picture once more. uc " Well , " he said softly , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There we are with Sharon , and there she is with us , and no one else in the world around . We relax together . We get to know her . She gets to know us . We spend two , three , four days rapping , talking about ourselves , each other , life in general , love in particular , until she feels at home with us , feels comfortable . Once she no longer feels disorientedor threatened , once she knows we 're good decent guys who care for her , good people treating her the way she herself always hoped some vain or men would treat her , then the ice is broken . " " Talk straight , " said Shively . " What does that mean ? " " It means we 're ready to tell her what we want , although I 'm sure she 'd grasp it long before . We tell her , and after that it 's up to her . She could choose to sleep with one or two of us , or all of us , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's out in the open . " " Wait a minute , kid , " said Shively , before Malone could go on . " Maybe you see no problem . But I see one pretty clear . Want to know what it is ? " " Sure , of course  --  " " I 'm not going through this much sweat to get my hands on her , " said Shively , " and maybe not get nothing back for it . You know what I 'm saying ? I 'm not going through this and then maybe have her suddenlydecide that she would n't mind putting it out for you and Yost , but not for me , maybe not for me and maybe not for Brunner . See ? It 's like that expression I heard you use one time  --  remember  --  about the four of us , it 's all or nothing  --  " " You mean what Dumas wrote in The Three Musketeers ? It 's all for one and one for all ? " " ' flat 's it ! " exclaimed Shively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my motto and nothing less . " " Mr. Shively , " Brunner said , " are you suggesting that even if Miss Fields did not want you or me , you 'd be determined to have intercourse with her anyway ? " " You bet your ass that 's what I 'm saying . " Hmunuer looked extremely troubled . " I could n't condone that under aiiv c ircumstance , Mr. Shively . I hate to bring up the word , but I see I must bring it tip once more . It is rape , criminal rape , you are speaking of . Mr. Shively . " " Call it whatever the hell you want , " snapped Shively . " Okay , rape . Hog deal , lint I 'm dust saying right now I 'm not going through with this without uuiic uxaurancc that I 'll get a piece of the action , one way oranotlmrmBrunner still would not have it . " Well , Mr. Shively , if you are entertainingany idea of rape , then I think you ought to be made aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . " He pushed himself off the couch . " Besides finding the act of forcible rape reprehensible and morally wrong , I also happen to know that in the eyes of the law it is one of the most serious crimes , short of murder , in existence . " He moved around the coffee table to his desk . " I anticipated that this might come up again , and I decided to be ready for it . I did some homework , Mr. Shively . Over the weekend , employing what legal knowledge I still possess , I did some quiet research on the subject . Would you like to hear the facts ? " " Not especially , " said Shively . While Malone rolled his chair aside , Brunner opened the center drawer of his desk . " Nevertheless , since we are speaking of being together on this project , I think not only you but each of us should be fully apprised of the facts . " He removed a blue-covered , legal-sized set of papers . " I have here certain portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're blowing hot air , Leo , " said Shively . " I 'm not interested . " Yost made a conciliatory gesture to Shively . " Let him read it , Shiv . It does n't hurt to know everything . Okay , Leo , go ahead and read to us from the local book of etiquette . " " The State of California Penal Code , " repeated Brunner . " To save time , I will merely quote from the key provisions I 'd previously checked off . " He cleared his throat and began to read in a monotone . " Section Two Sixty-one . Definition of rape . Rape is an act of sexual intercourse , accomplished with a female not the wife of the perpetrator , under either of the following circumstances : Where the female is under the age of eighteen ; where she is incapable , through lunacy or other unsoundness of mind , whether temporary or permanent , of giving legal consent ; where she resists , but her resistance is overcome by force c ' violence ; where she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm , accompanied by apparent power of execution , or by any intoxicatingnarcotic , or anesthetic , substance , administered by or with the privity of the accused ; where she is at the time unconscious of the nature of the act , and this is known to the accused ; where she submits under the beliefthat the person committing the act is her husband , and this belief is induced by any artifice , pretense , or concealment practiced by the accused , with intent to induce such belief . ' " Shively thought the last very funny . " That 's the solution , Leo , old boy . We 'll all make up to look like Sharon 's last husband and never tell her we are n't . " Brunner was not amused . He frowned at Shively , then returned to hisbrief . " Section Two Sixty-three on rape . Essential elements . Penetration . The essential guilt of rape consists in the outrage to the person and feelingsof the female . Any sexual penetration , however slight , is sufficient to complete the crime . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he exclaimed . " With Sharon Fields ? Listen , brother , I assure you it would n't be slight . " Ignoring him , Brunner continued . " Section Two Sixty-four defines punishments for the crime . I 'll skip to just what applies to what we 've been discussing here . The minimum for plain rape is imprisonment in the state prison not less than three years . ' If bodily injury is inflicted upon the victim , and proved in court , defendant shall suffer confinementin the state prison from fifteen years to life . ' " " There 'd be no bodily injury , " said Yost , " so none of that applies to us . As to  --  " Brunner held up a hand . " Wait , Howard , I was reading the wrong part . Here 's the part that applies to us exactly . The part where more than one person participates in the act . It 's Section Two Sixty-four point one of the Penal Code . In any case in which the defendant , voluntarily acting in concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will of the victim , committed the rape , either personally or by aiding and abetting such other section , such fact shall be charged in the indictmentor information and if found to be true . . . defendant shall suffer confinement in the state prison from five years to life . ' " Brunner raised his head , adjusted his glasses . " That 's what we 're talking about . Five years to life in prison . Maybe that 'll give you pause . " Malone sat forward in the swivel chair and tugged at Brunner 's sleeve . " Leo , what you 've read us is meaningless , because what we 're talking about would never come to that , to forcible gang rape . I mean , despite Kyle 's little speech earlier , that is simply not what we are about to do . But let 's suppose  --  let 's just make this up  --  let 's suppose Sharon doublecrossedus after , and went to the authorities and complained that she 'd been raped . You know what ? She would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're not the only one who 's been doing some research . " Malone guided his chair to the desk and began shuffling among his papers . " Get off your feet , Leo the Lion , " said Shively . " You 're blocking the view . " Annoyed , Brunner pointedly walked past the couch , and took the chairin toss ftnnt the desk . Malone hitd found what he wanted . " I 'll summarize what I learned. 88To begin with , according to the experts , seventy percent of all rapes are never reported to the police . Usually the victims are ashamed , do n't want it known , do n't want publicity , do n't want to be embarrassed in court . The last FBI breakdown listed thirty-eight thousand reported rapes in the United States  --  about thirty-six women raped out of every hundred thousand . But the FBI estimated there must have actually been five times as many rapes in that one year . You see , most women simply concealit . If a person like Sharon were actually raped , the odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think she might be one of the few who would , " said Brunner . " All right , " said Malone , agreeably , " let 's play it your way . Suppose Sharon was raped . Suppose she did report it . What are the chances that her rapists would be convicted and punished ? Small , very small . I have it here . Listen . Take Los Angeles County in one recent year  --  there were three thousand four hundred ninety forcible rapes reported that year . Of those , only one thousand three hundred eighty suspects were ever arrested . And of those arrested , a mere three hundred and twenty were found guilty and put away . So you see  --  " " Hey , that 's interesting , " Yost broke in . " I never knew that . How come it 's so hard to get a conviction in a rape case ? " " Many reasons , " replied Malone . " The main factor is psychological . Juries are hung up on an old-fashioned sexist notion that no women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's assumed that if a woman was penetrated , she wanted it , even enjoyed it , because that 's the biological nature of things . Like one prosecutor in the district attorney 's office was quoted as saying , Unless the victim 's head is bashed in or she 's ninetyfiveyears old or it 's some other kind of extreme case , jurors jus. ca n't believe a woman was raped . There 's a suspicion that it was her fault , that she led a guy on , or consented  --  consent is the hardest thing to disprove . It 's just his word against hers . ' Once the accused says he did n't do it by force , says that she agreed to have sexual intercourse , it becomes difficult to disprove that . Another thing . The physical evidence . When a woman is raped , the police immediately rush her to the Central ReceivingHospital . They have her submit to a pelvic examination , obtain a sperm smear , give her an antiseptic douche  --  but they like to have the immediate sperm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only if the victim is contacted at the scene or if she reports what happenedimmediately . Only two out of a hundred women go to the police immediately . The rest of them usually go home or somewhere to get over the shock , calm down , and the first thing they do after is want to89clean up . That way they wash away all the evidence . So , Leo , you can see that if Sharon ever dreamt of making up a rape complaint against us , there 's almost no chance she 'd get anywhere . " " I disagree , " said Brunner . " She 's not any ordinary victim . She 's the most famous actress in the world . They 'd listen . They 'd believe , both the police and the jury . " " You could n't be more wrong , " said Malone emphatically . " The fact that she is who she is would work against her in a case like this . I 've investigated police procedure . One of the first things the police do is start running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaining victim 's past performances , her sexual background and history . Well , we know Sharon 's history . There have been many men in it . Countless publicized sex scandals . I do n't think the prosecution could present her on the stand as a shy , virginal type . For God 's sake , she 's the world 's leading sex symbol . No , Leo , no chance for us to be hurt . " " Well , maybe , " said Brunner , still doubtful . " Anyway , it 's beside the point . As I said before , it would never come down to that . We 're not going to assault her forcibly . We 're not like the ignorant , sick , warped men who do such things . We 're average guys . We 're civilized human beings . Besides , as I 've contended right along , rape does n't even enter into our plan , because it does n't have to . Sure , Sharon might be a little annoyed at first , resentful about being carted off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know us , well , I think she 'd cool down and then warm up . After all , she 's a crazy adventurous girl , the kind of girl who 'd appreciate what we 'd done and even respect our nerve . There 's every chance she 'd be receptive to us . So I think you can stop worrying , Leo . There 's no crime involved in our plan . " " There is a crime , " said Brunner . He shifted to address himself to Yost and Shively as well . " I 'm sorry to be the one to be so obstructive . But I think it 'll do us no good to be impulsive , to jump into this without taking into consideration the facts and risks of such an enterprise . Becauseeven if we rule out rape , I say again , there is another crime involved . There 's the crime of kidnapping . " " Hell , Leo , if she cooperates after we 've become acquainted , she 's not going to bum-rap us on kidnapping , " said Yost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me another beer . " " But she might , she might , " Brunner buzzed after him . " Do you know what the law of kidnapping is in this state ? " He took the bound set of vipers from his lap , and quickly peeled through them . " You all ought to be fully informed . " 1pShively grunted his disdain . " Chrissakes , Leo , do n't bend our ears no more with that legal bullshit . " But Brunner would not be silenced . " Section Two Hundred and Seven of the California Penal Code . A kidnapper is every person who forcibly steals , takes , or arrests any person in this state , and carries him into anothercountry , state , or county , or into another part of the same county . ' I guess that 's simple enough . Just as simple as Section Two Hundred and Eight which spells out the amended law for punishing such an act . If you abduct somebody , the crime is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison not less than ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the set of papers on his desk top . " Are all of you ready to risk twenty-five years of your life to have a weekend with this woman ? Because that 's the penalty for kidnapping , and what you 're talking about is kidnapping and nothing else . " Malone came out of the swivel chair . " Leo , you are missing the point entirely . Of course , this act would be kidnapping if we abducted Sharon by force against her will and she accused us of doing so . But have n't I made it clear , shown you enough evidence , to prove that once we had her , talked to her , did her no harm , she 'd have no reason to accuse us of such a crime ? She 'd never do that . She 'd have no reason to . " Brunner wriggled uneasily . " I wish I could be as certain as you . " " All right , I 'll go even further . Suppose , no matter what , once we released her unharmed , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went to the police . Who would she have to accuse ? You see , in my plan I 've anticipated that . When we pick her up , we 'd be wearing disguises . We 'd wear the disguises whenever we were in her presence . We 'd never mention each other 's names . She 'd have absolutely no way of knowing who we are or what we really look like afterward . No , Leo , she 'd have no targets to aim at if worse came to worse . " " You seem to have thought of everything , " said Brunner . " But I have . It 's necessary to anticipate every contingency . No , nothing would go haywire . It would be too well planned . " He half turned toward the others , smiling . " We 'd have our fun with her , then release her in a week or whatever time we decided , and she 'd forget it , only remember it as an unusual adventure , and resume her life  --  and we 'd split , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But we 'd have something special that very , very few plain people have ever had . We 'd have behind us an unforgettable experience . Yes , we 'd have an experience that millions of men dream about their entire lives and never enjoy . We 'd be among the chosen few . That 's what we 've got to keep in mind . The reward . " 91Shively slapped his knee resoundingly , and they all turned to him . " Goddammit , enough hot air , " he commanded . " Let 's focus on the end , and not worry our asses about the means . We 'll hammer out the means . " He paused . " I 'm telling you where I stand . I like it . I 'm for it . I do n't know about you guys , but me , I 'm with Adam here . He 's done his preparation like a real general and everything he says makes sense . I say it can be done , and the payoff is worth taking the shot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " So all right , so what 's to worry ? " said Shively expansively . " We just lay it out to the last minor detail . If we develop Adam 's plan to the smallest detail , we 'll run no risk . You believe me . I was an assistant to our platoon leader , infantry , in Vietnam . Organization and planning and enough guts to follow through are the only things that matter . Every assault or raid our task force ever made was figured out in advance , and look , I 'm here , it worked . What we 're talking about now is ten times easier . It 'll work the same way . " Brunner remained unconvinced . Stubbornly , he continued to resist . " Gentlemen , to sit around here and drink and talk , speculating , indulgingour fancies , that is one thing . Harsh reality is something else again . Talk is cheap , especially uninhibited stag talk . But the minute you turn this sort of daydreaming into a real-life venture , the minute you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred obstacles and pitfalls , maybe more . I  --  I hate to be the devil 's advocate , but  --  " Shively twisted toward Brunner , out of patience and in a temper . " Then goddammit , stop monkey-wrenching our project . If you do n't want to be a part of this , if you want out , now 's the time to quit . " He stared at the accountant . " If you do n't believe in what we 're doing  --  why in the hell did you invite us up here to your office ? " For the first time , Brunner was taken aback . Flustered , he tried to find an answer . " I  --  I do n't know . I ca n't say , really . Maybe  --  well , I guess I just thought it would be fun to  --  to talk about . " " It 's more than that , " said Shively angrily , " and now I 'm going to tell you what it is , and why the hell you 're here , and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and me , too , why I 'm here . It 's because we 've been fucked by society all our lives , just the way most of the people in the world have been . We 're trapped in one place for the rest of our years like we were born in a caste system . " " ' I'h , it 's the radical point of view , " Brunner protested , " and I 'm not quite sure it 's  --  " " I 'm saying I 'm positive that 's the way it is , " asserted Shively , his voiec stamping out Brunner 's . " And I 'm no radical , either . I 'm not interested in politics . I 'm interested in me , and I do n't like the way the system puts me down . The real criminals in this country are the powerful and the fat cats . They exploit us . They use us . They give us nothing , so 's they can keep everything for themselves . Because they already got everything , they keep getting more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best vacations , the best cars , the best ass around . And they shit on us down below , like we should be flushed away . They got a closedshopunion , and we ai n't allowed in . And , Brunner , I 'm telling you straight , for once in my life I 've had enough of it . I want in . I want my piece of the action . If it 's not dough I can get , then let it be first-grade ass , the best there is , the kind they can have whenever they want it . " Shively was on his feet , agitated , his gaunt face contorted , the veins behind his temples prominent . He confronted Brunner , stood over him , waved his hand to encompass the entire office . " Look around this room , Brunner , just look . Four strangers who happened to meet by accident . Not one of us specially selected or handpicked . Just four average guys from every walk of life , right ? " He pointed a finger at Yost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A college man . Educated . A football star . Now what is he ? Tied down day and night working his rear end off to support a wife and two kids . And he has to scramble for every spare nickel , you believe me . If he wants some fun on the side , some variety out of i'fe , he 's got to pray he 'll get lucky and land some love-starved prospective woman client . Or he 's got to get out of town for more work , and on his own time when he 's free he 's got to pay for it , pay for some beat-up twat . " Shively 's finger moved to Malone , who was listening fascinated behind the desk . " Look at the kid , Malone , Adam Malone . Smart kid . Lots of imagination . A writer who should be free to write , but instead has to spend half his time stacking cans of sardines in some goddam supermarket for his bread . And for relaxation , where does he turn ? I 'll bet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chick he meets in the market once in a while . The closest he can get to the rich guy 's ass , to a Sharon Fields , is by having a wet dream in bed alone . " Shively poked at his own chest . " Look at me . Kyle Shively from Texas . Maybe I 'm not school-educated , but I 'm smart . I learned a lot on my own . I got what you call common sense and knowledge of human nature . And I got skills , too . With my pair of hands here , I can make anything . Maybe if I 'd had a break I 'd have been a millionaire car-builder like that Ferrari and those other dagos . And speaking of skills , it 's not only my hands , it 's also inmy crotch . But what good does it do me ? If I want me some fun with chicks , who can I get to join in ? Some stupid teenagers or some dimestoreclerks in the neighborhood . The uppity rich broads I see day after day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , a grease monkey , an ignorant servant . They wo n't give me the time of day . I 'm nothing . And now , we come to you , Brunner  --  " He paused , hands on his hips , contemplating Brunner , who would not meet his eyes . " And what about you , Mr. Leo Brunner , in this palace hall of yours out on crummy Western Avenue ? Do n't tell me you 're happy , or even satisfied , with your life . Do n't tell me you got all you want out of life , all the juices , everything there is , just from your old lady alone , from being married to the same old lady for thirty years . In those thirty years you got it off only twice with something different , and then by accident , because they were sorry for you . " Brunner winced , his head lowering between his shoulders turtlelike , but he said nothing . " Listen , you ca n't fool me , " Shively continued . " Do n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to get into some of the stuff those rich guys got a lock on , the stuff you see in pictures or in the papers . Well , man , I 'm going to tell you something franker than you ever heard before . How long have you got left on this earth ? Your poor unused prick is withering away , gradually withering away . It 's never enjoyed any of the good life your so-called superiors have . In ten years , you wo n't be able to get it up no more , you 'll be through . In twenty years , you wo n't get it up no more , because you 'll be dust , you 'll be dead , and on the last day before dying you 'll know that not once did you have the experience , the fun , you read about others having . What do you say to that , Brunner ? " Breathing heavily , Shively waited . The room was quiet as a mausoleum . Brunner sat dejected , head hanging , eyes averted . After what seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what can I say ? I suppose in some respects you  --  you 're right . I  --  I have to be honest with myself . Yes . I guess I have n't really had much chance to  --  to live . " " You bet you have n't , old man . But I 'm saying now you got a chance , maybe one last chance , and I 'm saying take it . Reach for the brass ring . ( noc along for the ride all the way . Just stop thinking . Just shut your cyr unu ) plunge  --  and maybe you 'll have something to justify your rxitlrm r and make the rest of your life worthwhile . Okay ? " 94Almost imperceptibly , Brunner nodded . From the couch , Yost spoke up . " I go along with you , Shiv . You put it well , but I 'd put it a little differently , if you do n't mind . I 'd say let 's not shut our eyes and plunge . I 'd say let 's open them wider before plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we are going . " " Suits me , " said Shively with a shrug , as he took up a beer , knocked the cap off , and started back to the couch . " Just as long as we get going . " Yost was addressing Malone now . " I 'm a gambler , Adam . But I 'm also a statistician . I like to gamble when I 've got the right odds . So let 's make the odds right on this little investment . Let 's take your overall plan , examine it step by step , go over every step with a fine-tooth comb , find every hole , plug it , make the whole effort positively foolproof . " " I 'm perfectly agreeable , " replied Malone . " I 'm open to a complete rewrite . Where do you propose we start in ? " " At the very beginning , " said Yost . " Let 's get firsthand or eyewitness answers to these questions I 'm going to pose . " " One second , " said Malone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil and opening his notebook . " Let me get this down . " Yost waited , then resumed . " Ready ? First and foremost , Sharon Fields ' habits and routine . I 'm not satisfied having it secondhand from some newspapers and magazines . I want verified eyewitness reports . What is her real daily routine ? Does she actually take a walk early every morning ? Is it really every morning ? And exactly what time ? Is she alone when she walks ? Who is inside her house and outside on her grounds when she walks ? Get it ? " Malone glanced up from his writing . " You mean we 've got to scout her in person ? " " In person . Not once or twice but many times , to be positive . You say there 's an elevated place from where her grounds can be observed ? " " Yes . From the top of Stone Canyon Road . " " Okay . Excellent . Next question , the date . When can we pull it off ? In a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to find out her plans , with no mistakes . " " I can get a schedule of her activities , " Malone promised . " Next , " said Yost , " how long should we arrange to be away with Sharon Fields ? How do we coordinate our individual activities so that each of us can take off a week or ten days at precisely the same time ? Once we have her , where do we take her ? Actually , I know a perfect place , but as I told you , I 'll get into that later . Next , how do we get a vehicle to hide her in , one that ca n't be traced , and what kind of vehicle95should it be ? How do we disguise ourselves in a real believable way ? Once we 're in the hideout , the place where we are going , what kind of supplies do we need ? Then there 's more  --  " His voice trailed off . " Like what ? " asked Shively . " Umm , we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Yost slowly . " For example , once we grab her , who are the people who will miss her ? What will they do when they find out she is missing ? As for ourselves , what emergency schemes , alternatives , do we have if someone spots us while we 're grabbing her or driving away with her ? How can we be sure , each one of us , that the people close to us , employers , wives , friends , wo n't be checking to find out where we are when we 're away ? Then , finally , there 's the psychological part of the enter-prise  --  " Malone 's pencil stopped . " Meaning what ? " Yost pursed his lips thoughtfully . " Say we 've pulled it off successfully . We 've got Sharon alone in an isolated area . Now , I happen to think Adam is right . I have a hunch she 'll play along , if only for kicks . She 'll like the excitement , something new , different , or maybe just because she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , " said Shively with a grin . " Or even that , " said Yost , still thinking . " But I guess here 's what I 'm leading up to . ' What if she finally resents being grabbed  --  or as someone brought up  --  what if she responds to only one or two of us , not the four of us ? How do we handle that ? We 've got to be in unanimous agreement in advance . We 've got to be of one mind and stick to what we agree upon here . " " I believe I have the compromise answer , " said Malone . " But we 've all got to swear to it now , this far in advance , and never deviate from it if we are in accord . I suggest that we make the only involuntary act on Sharon 's part her being picked up . " Brunner found his voice . " There  --  there is a second involuntary act on her part . That is when she wakes up in the  --  the hideaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether she wants to stay or not , until we have a chance to make her acquaintance . " " You 're right , Leo , " Malone said . " That 's the only other involuntary act on her part . After that , I suggest anything she does has to be voluntary , volunteered by her , without coercion on our part . If she chooses to stay , and to make love , reciprocate our love , it has to be with all of us , not one , not two , not three , but with all four of us . It has to be all of us or none of us . " Ile paused . " Let me underline this . If she wants to cooperate with us  --  as I have no doubt she will  --  there 's no problem . We 've made it . The rainbow . The pot of gold . However , if she says she 'll cooperate with only one of us , or with any number less than four of us , we must agree right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go free without another word . There 'll be no force , no harm to her , no criminal acts . That 's got to be our basic and absolute agreement . What do you say ? You , Howard ? " " Fair enough , " said Yost . " I 'll buy that . " " And you , Leo ? " " I  --  I think that would be the right thing . I can go along on that basis . " " Shiv ? " Shively grinned broadly , and cupped a hand over his crotch . " What 're we wasting any more time for ? Just draw me a map , and point me in the right direction . " He grabbed his crotch tighter . " Everything 's in go ' position . " They had their assignments , and they needed time . It was not until the following Saturday , five days later , that they reassembled , on this occasion in Adam Malone 's Santa Monica apartment at nine o'clock in the evening . They arrived , Malone observed , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each of them carrying something , like so many Wise Men bearing gold , frankincense , myrrh . Once drinks had been poured , they quickly settled down to business . Yost and Brunner drew chairs up on either side of Malone at the dining table , and Shively made himself comfortable in the leather chair , crackingthe shells of peanuts and chomping the nuts between swallows of his beer . " If you do n't mind , I 'll serve as the collective 's secretary , " Malone began . " Collective ? What in the hell 's that ? " Shively wanted to know . " All for one , and one for all , " said Malone . " Oh , " said Shively . " Okay , then . For a second there I thought you were pitching us some Communist thing . " Malone smiled tolerantly . " Do n't worry . We 're a democratic organization . The Fan Club , remember ? " He opened his notebook and took up his pencil , as he consulted a sheet of paper before him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . I think we agreed that we 'd cometo this meeting with some of the answers . I 'll read off one question at a time , and then we 'll resolve it , and I 'll jot down our decision on how to proceed . Should we start ? " " I 'm listening , " said Yost eagerly . " Very well . First question . Who are the people apt to be in Sharon 's house or on her grounds during any given day of the week ? That 's essentialto know . Any of you got any definite information on that ? " Leo Brunner , eyes shining behind his convex lenses , lifted a hand tentatively . " I  --  I think I can be of some help , " he said shyly . " I believe I know what persons are in Miss Fields ' employ , at least as of last April . " He hesitated . " I 've never done anything like this before . I 'm afraid that to obtain this information , I 've been an accessory in breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open his brown attache case , and came up with what appeared to be about twenty legal-sized photostats . " I have acquired a copy of the last income tax form filed by Sharon Fields with the Internal Revenue Service . " Yost was immediately impressed . " No kidding , Leo ? How in the devil  --  " " I do n't dig it , " said Shively . " What 's that going to tell us ? " " A good deal , quite a good deal , " said Brunner proudly . " Your average layman may consider an IRS return as a dull , routine set of figures . But I have spent many years of my life preparing tax returns , and to a practiced accountant a person 's IRS return is tantamount to a biography . I can assure you that if you know how to read income tax returns , they are as fascinating and revealing as a private detective 's report . Properly read , a detailed tax return , with its accompanying schedules and statements , can give you a true profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flipped through the photostats . " Yes , Miss Fields ' tax return divulges a good deal of what we wish to learn . I do n't know how I ever thought of of acquiring it . " " That was brilliant , Leo , " Malone said with sincere admiration . " Thank you , " said Brunner , pleased . " Now in answer to the question  --  who are the persons in Miss Fields ' employ who might be inside her house or on her estate during any week ? I 've paper-clipped the pertinent pages  --  " Ile riffled through the pages . " Here we have it . Business deductions . Salaries and Wages . ' A detailed explanation is attached . Here we lave Ms.  --  yes , she . is listed as Ms.  --  Nellie Wright , full-time secretary . She apparently lives on the premises , because this document reveals that two rooms in the house  --  one for personal use , the other for use as an other , am dcchided as business expenditures . Listed as a partial business expcnrc are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple who serve as Miss Fields ' housekeeper and chauffeur . They also live on the estate , in a guesthouse behind the main house . Then , under Schedule Cl , we have salaries given for a Henry Lenhardt , listed as public relations counsel , and Felix Zigman , personal manager  --  he was the preparer of the tax return . There is no indication that either Mr. Lenhardt or Mr. Zigman lives on the premises , but I would guess they visit the house frequently . Now , let me see  --  " Brunner turned the pages , as Malone made notes . " Here , this could be important , " Brunner continued . " Listed as a partial business expense are wages paid to three gardeners or groundkeeperscalled K. Ito and Sons . Another business expense , one vulnerable to challenge by IRS , but significant to us  --  the amount paid out annually for maintenance of a protective alarm system and for a private patrol that polices Miss Fields ' estate . " " Hey , that 's important , Leo , " Shively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yost said with growing respect . Brunner accepted the accolades modestly . " Well , I trust it has helped a little . I guess that is about as much as I could derive from this source . " He shoved the tax return into his attache case and snapped it shut . " How 'd you ever get hold of something like that ? " Malone wanted to know . " I  --  I prefer not to reveal my means , " said Brunner . " Suffice it to say that I have a pipeline to the offices of the Internal Revenue Service in Los Angeles . " Yost was momentarily worried . " ' Whoever it was , whoever gave it to you , Leo , was n't that person curious about why you wanted Sharon Fields ' income tax return ? " " Actually , no . " Brunner hesitated before going on . " I obtained this return through someone close to me , someone for whom I 've done favors in the past . But to prevent any questions , I had a story prepared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the account of a rising young motion picture actress , an actress who one day might attain the eminence of a Sharon Fields . I said I planned to meet with her in the near future , but before doing so I wanted to be totally conversant with the special income tax problems that I might face in handling someone in the entertainment world . I wanted to know about the amount of flexibilitypossible in the area of deductions . I said it would be most useful to me to have a look at a recent return filed by someone like Sharon Fields  --  in fact , it would mean a lot to me to see Miss Fields ' own last return . " " I still do n't see how your friend got hold of anything so private , " said Malone . " Like you , I thought it would be difficult , too . Well , this friend of mine  --  if you want to be honest , and I tell you this in confidence , my friend works in the local offices of the IRS  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax returns directly to the Internal Revenue Service Center in Ogden , Utah . If the Los Angeles offices require a copy for sonic reason or other , they contact Ogden and receive a copy in three to four weeks . However , when there is an audit , Los Angeles receives copies of the returns to be audited , and these are kept here on file . Needless to say , someone in Miss Fields ' income tax bracket would be audited annually . So there was a full file of her returns on hand locally . My friend was able to obtain this copy for me overnight . He had no idea of how I really intended to use it . " Yost was lost in thought briefly . " You know , the information Leo 's just given us alerts us to three obstacles we must overcome . To wit : How extensive is that alarm system in Sharon Fields ' house  --  I mean , does it extend to the front gate ? Next , the private patrol cars . How often do they come by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those gardeners , Mr. Ito and his sons , what days and what hours do they do their lawn mowing and trimming and whatever ? " Malone put down his pencil and said , " I can answer each of those questions , at least partly . " He had taken it upon himself , he explained , to spy upon the activities around the Sharon Fields estate during the past week . He had been at his observation post every morning and for a part of three afternoons when he was not working . He had borrowed a pair of binoculars . He had also taken along a camera , so that he could pretend that he was a professionalphotographer , in case someone in the neighborhood wondered what he was doing . He had gone to the high point on Stone Canyon Road in Bel Air , stationed himself in his place of concealment , and observed all the activity going on far below . The vigil , he was delighted to say , had been most productive . " Like what ? " demanded Shively . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the early morning stroll that 's been written about . She was out there every single morning I watched . She started her stroll at almost seven o'clock , give or take a few minutes . She walked along rather slowly , accompanied only by her Yorkshire terrier . " " What kind of hound is that ? " Shively asked with concern. 100Malone reassured him . " To ordinary dogs , the Yorkshire is a gnat . You could put a Yorkshire in Leo 's attache case . " " Okay , " said Shively . " What else ? " " I could n't take my eyes off her , " said Malone . " My God , she 's beautiful . Anyway , anyway , she sauntered along that road from the house right up to the iron gate . I would lose sight of her only once going and once returning  --  there 's a large clump of trees about two thirds of the way to the gate . She arrived at the gate each time at about seven fifteen , then turned around and retraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're interested in is where she is at seven fifteen , " said Shively . " Right ? " Malone nodded . " Yes . Now , as to your questions , Howard . I saw those three gardeners once .. Never in the mornings . Not on Friday or Sunday and I could n't stay for this afternoon . But Saturday afternoon , just after one o'clock , this old man Ito and his two grown sons arrived and spread out , working at their gardening from one to four o'clock . " " Good to know , " said Yost . " But you 'd better check on them further . " " I intend to , " Malone promised . " You see , I figure with Sharon 's grounds being as large as they are , Ito and his sons ca n't do the job working just once a week . They 'd have to come at least one or two more times during the week . So I 'll be watching for them . Now , the private patrol car . I got a bead on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's painted black and white . One person in the car , the uniformed patrolman . He drove by the front gate at approximately ten o'clock every morning , and again at three o'clock every afternoon . " " Did he get out of his car , go on the grounds ? " Brunner wondered . " More important , " said Shively , " does he carry a gun ? " " The answer to that comes out of my answer to Leo 's question . I do n't know about a gun because he never got out of his patrol car . Just slowed it down outside the gate , kind of looked the grounds over , then made a U-turn and drove away . " Shively slapped a hand on one thigh . " That 's the kind of sharp security patrol I like . " " I agree , " said Malone . " All we have to do is be there when they 're not there . Now we come to the alarm  --  " " Yes , I 've been waiting for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you my observations and deductions . When the gardener , Ito , arrived , he spoke into some kind of speaker set in a post in front of the gate , and seconds after that the two sections of the double gate automatically opened inward . Also , about ten after ten this morning , 101one of those special pure mountain-water delivery trucks , I think it was Puritas , came to the gate . The driver talked into the speaker , the gate automatically uncoupled and swung open . What does that tell you ? " " It tells me enough to start with , " said Shively , shifting forward in his leather chair . " This sort of stuff is my bag . Tells me the gate is electronicallyopened and closed from inside the house . It also tells me the alarm itself probably covers just the house proper . Although , we ca n't be sure from watching like that . There are a hundred different systems . If that Sharon has her alarm system also tied into the front gate , we 'd be in real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , it still sets off a silent alarm , feeds an electronic card or warning to the patrol headquarters , where they radio an alert to one of their patrol cars . So that 's something we 've got to be pretty damn sure about . " " I 'm wholeheartedly with you , Shiv , " said Yost . " We 've got to be absolutely positive about handling everything . We ca n't leave anything to chance , especially anything as dangerous as an alarm system . " He fumbled in the breast pocket of his jacket for a cigar , unpeeled it , bit off the tip , as he continued to give this particular obstacle some thought . Suddenly , his broad face brightened . " Look , I have an idea how we can check out both the alarm system and that patrol car . " He pointed his cigar at Malone . " I 'll need your help , Adam . " " Name it . " " Next time you 're at your observation post , focus your binoculars on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the company . You do that , and I 'll do the rest . " " I 'll remember to . " " Good . Then phone it to me at my office . What I 'll do is this  --  I ' 11 call the patrol company , pretend I 'm a potential customer for installation and service , give them a phony name and fake address in Bel Air , or maybe a real address of some house near Sharon 's place . I 'll say I have this big house , grounds , outer gate  --  sort of describe Sharon Fields ' layout  --  and say I want some preliminary information on their various systems , how they work , how foolproof they are , the costs involved , and I want to know this before arranging an appointment for them to come over with more exact figures . " " Do you think they 'll cooperate ? " asked Brunner . " Sure , Leo , they 're bound to be looking for new business . Anyway , I 'm good at breaking down people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'll get them to talk . That way I 'll find out whether the main alarm system they install protects only the house or is also in some way conmetalto the outside gate and fence . If the protection includes gateand fence , we 'll have to think up some other means of entry , if any alternative is even possible . We 'll just have to hope the electronic gate lock is a separate unit , having nothing to do with the interior alarm system . They are usually separate . But I want to make sure . I 'll have it for our next meeting . " " Yeah , you do that , " said Shively . " Because if the gate is a separate electronic unit , I can handle it easy . Deactivate it in minutes the night before we move in . Then we can open the gate manually and enter . " " Perfect , " said Malone , scribbling his notes . " And I can keep up my surveillance of her estate from that elevated vantage point I found . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But two weeks before we 're ready to make our move , I 'll do it on a daily basis practically full time . I 'll also have the schedule of the gardeners for you . Also , the patrol car . And any other type of visitors that show up on any regular basis . " " I 'll pitch in with you when we get nearer takeoff time , " said Shively . " Four eyes are better than two . Besides , I want to have another look at the object of our affection . " Malone had gone back to studying the questions on the typed agenda sheet before him . " The hideout , " he said . " Seems to me that 's one of the crucial things to be solved . Once we have her , where do we take her that 's isolated and safe ? " Yost finished lighting his cigar . He shook out the flame of his match . " No problem . Remember my mentioning I had a place in mind ? " The others indicated that they remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a cloud of smoke , Yost said , " We 're in luck . You just wo n't believe it . The perfect setup , made-to-order for our operation . " In no hurry , eager to build up his contribution , Yost began to speak of his longtime friendship with a man named Raymond Vaughn , a successfulengineer . Every year , until a year ago , Yost and Vaughn had gone off on hunting trips together . In fact , their children had attended the same schools . Anyway , this Vaughn had always been a great one for getting away from it all , escaping the city on long weekends or during vacations to rough it with his family in some remote and relatively isolated area . About eight years ago , while hiking in an absolutely out-of-the-way and desolate area in the Gavilan Hills , near Arlington , California , Vaughn had come across a piece of acreage with a weathered , almost illegible ' For Sale ' sign on it . Vaughn decided this was an ideal site for a vacation retreat . He bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two years , using native granite boulders and cement blocks , he constructed an eight-room lodge , completely furnished it and equipped it with its own underground1 n.3septic tank and cesspool and its own electrical system supplied by a portable power plant . Vaughn had spent a small fortune , and considerableenergy , on this self-contained dream hideaway , and he and his family had been able to enjoy its comforts and privacy at least two or three times a year . Because , despite its remoteness , Vaughn 's rustic lodge had been no more than a two-hour drive from the heart of Los Angeles . " Then , a little more than a year ago  --  and here 's where we 're in luck  --  my friend was transferred out of L.A. , " Yost went on . " His company got a fat construction contract in Guatemala , and Vaughn was asked to supervise the project in return for expenses , a raise , a bonus . Naturally , he could n't resist . Besides , he looked forward to a change . So he leased his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moved down to Antigua . Before doing so , he decided against selling his lodge in the Gavilan Hills . Not that it would have been easy to sell , anyway . It 's so damn inaccessible . So he turned the keys to the place over to me , just in case I ever wanted to use it during the hunting season . I went up there only once , after he left , to make sure it was all locked up tight and safe . " Yost paused , beaming at the others , as he gave them his gift . " Well , it 's ours , right there waiting for us , " he said . " It 's made-toorderfor us . No one ever goes near it . No one even knows it exists . " " Somebody must 've built it for him , " said Shively . " They 'd know where it is . " Yost shook his head . " I assure you , no one knows . Vaughn built most of it with his own two hands . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's good at . He used granite boulders found in the immediate area , and some cement blocks he hauled in , for the outer walls . In that way , he eliminated any necessity for carpenters , plasterers , all the rest . He laid in a rough wooden floor and covered it with linoleum tiles and throw rugs . For the interior walls he used prefinished wood panels . He laid asphalt shingles on the roof , and inside he left the ceiling beams exposed and just stained them . Oh , he had some help , as I recall . Hired a couple of itinerant Mexican wetbacks to lend muscle . But that was years ago , and those Mexicans were just passing through and probably never knew where the place actually was , and anyway , they 're probably hack in Mexico long since or somewhere in jail . No , Shiv , I would n't worry about that . " " What about county building inspectors ? " asked Malone . " Or utility bilk on file somewhere ? " Yost chuckled . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vaughn , built this out of sight , out of the way , without anyone 's knowledge . No inspectors knew of it . No utility companies , either . No telephoneor gas or water or electric bills , because it has neither telephone nor gas , and water is pumped out of the backyard well , and I told you the place has its own portable generator for electricity . Look , it was hard enough for my friend himself to reach the place at first , let alone get supplies to the area . There was a dirt road that wound over the hills half the distance and after that nothing but brush and bushes and scrub trees in the direction of his property . He had to labor for months clearing a narrow side road off this dirt road , one wide enough to carry a vehicle , and he had to carve it out over the hills around Mount Jalpan , and down into his valley retreat . Just take my word , boys . This is as remote and safe as  --  as Robinson Crusoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mas a Tierra was the actual Crusoe island , " said Malone promptly . " Okay , now we 've got our own Mas a Tierra , " said Yost . " And instead of Crusoe 's man Friday , we have our girl Sharon , " said Malone . He picked up his pencil . " From now on Mas a Tierra is our code name for the hideout . " Brunner coughed nervously . " Howard , what if your friend , Mr. Vaughn , suddenly returned and looked in on  --  on Mas a Tierra ? " " No chance . Relax , Leo . My friend 's got a five-year contract down in Guatemala , got his kids in school in Mexico City . In the last letter he wrote me , he said if he were ever able to take a few days off , he wanted to use it to spend more time with his kids in Mexico . Vaughn wo n't be back in these parts for three or four years . " " Well , we got that one solved , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , how in the hell do we get to that cabin ? " " It takes two types of vehicles to get there . An ordinary car or mediumsizedtruck can make it on the old dirt road halfway into the Gavilan Hills . After that , where Vaughn cut away his homemade road the rest of the distance around Mount Jalpan , it requires something smaller and tougher . You can hike the last half of the distance . But I 'd say it 's a devil of a hike in summer unless you 're in shape . We tried it once . After that we rented a motorcycle , I remember , carried it up halfway in a pickup truck . Then we 'd leave the pickup truck at the halfway point , and go the rest of it on the motorcycle . When we went home , we 'd take the cycle , park it hidden in the bush , get into the truck for the ride down out of the hills to the Riverside freeway and home . Hey , I just remembered something I 'd forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took him two trips up and down to bring his family in there . It just came back to me . He replaced the motorcycle with a Cox dune buggy , which he remodeled by adding two makeshift jump105seats in back and a canvas top . Ever see one of those dune buggies in action ? They can take rocks , gullies , steepest hills , rutted roads , sand , anything . Now , I 'm just trying to remember  --  " " Remember what ? " Malone prodded. "  --  just what he did with that dune buggy before going to Guatemala . No , I 'm sure he did n't sell it . What am I saying ? I saw the damn thing up there after Vaughn left . Of course , he left it behind , parked under the carport , even told me to use it once in a while to keep it in shape . But that last time I was there , the damn thing would n't start  --  " " Dead battery , " said Shively. "  --  so I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foot . God , Shiv , there may be more than the battery that 's wrong with it by now . Nobody 's used that car for a year . I do n't know whether it can be made to go . " " Forget it , " said Shively . " I can make anything go . " " Okay , " said Yost with renewed enthusiasm , " let 's take a look for ourselves . What do you say , Shiv ? One morning next week , real early , we can make a dry run of the exact route to Arlington , and then into the hills to the lodge or cabin  --  " " Mas a Tierra , " Malone reminded him . " Sure , sure , whatever . " He turned back to Shively . " We can make the dry run , time it out going and coming , right down to the minute . We can take my Buick halfway into the hills , and carry in some cans of extra gasoline for the dune buggy . You can bring along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can lug the stuff the rest of the distance to the cabin on foot  --  I do n't look forward to that , but it 'll be the only time , I hope  --  and you can repair the buggy , and I can check out the cabin and see what shape it 's in and whether everything is in working order and what supplies would be needed . How 's about it ? " " Any morning , " said Shively . " Just give me a day 's notice . " Malone 's pencil was tapping his typed agenda for the evening . " All right , that takes care of our second vehicle . What about the main one , the first one ? The one we use to  --  well , to pick up Sharon and to drive on the freeway to the hills . I do n't think any of our ordinary cars will do . I think we should have some kind of van-model truck with an enclosedback or maybe a camper to conceal her in . Like an El Camino or VW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass from a hole in the ground , " Shively interruptedbelligerently , annoyed that Malone had invaded his precious territory . " When it comes to knowing what 's right in cars , you 'd better106leave it to me . Those fancy cars and campers you mentioned would cost us a bushel , even secondhand . Where would we get the money , unless you 're ready to pay for it all yourself ? Naw . You leave that part of it to me . I 'll get my hands on some small , old abandoned panel truck  --  maybe an ancient Yamahauler van or Chevy  --  there are still some of those around , broken-down and abandoned in dumps . I 'll handpick the right one , scavenge some salvageable parts from others , work on it , make it shipshape , and no charge for the labor . Okay , kid ? " " Certainly that 's okay , Shiv . That 's great . Then , maybe at the last minute we can paint something on the side of the truck to make it look like we 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. , something like that . Afterwards , we can paint it out . " Having conciliated Shively , Malone glanced at his agenda once more . " This brings us to supplies . ' What kind of supplies would we need for Mas a Tierra ? " " It all depends , " said Yost . " Depends on how long the four of us  --  five of us , actually  --  are going to be holed up there . We have n't settled on the time span yet . It seems to me we should settle that as soon as possible . " " What about one week ? " said Malone . " Naw , not enough time , " Shively objected . " I 've been turning it over in my mind . One week does n't cut it . You got to figure , according to Adam 's approach , two , three , maybe even four days wasted settling the chick down and getting her in a receptive mood . That would leave us maybe three days for some sport . I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for just three days . " " You were satisfied with just one night the first time I met you , " said Malone . " That was then . This is now . And now the thing is becoming realer . So why not take advantage of it ? I say let 's make it two weeks  --  that sounds just about right for the summer  --  a two-week vacation . What do you say ? " " I have no objection , " said Malone . " Whatever you all agree upon . ' What about you , Howard ? " Yost contemplated the two weeks . " Well , I guess it 's possible . My clients do without me for two weeks whenever I take Elinor and the children on a vacation . I suppose my clientele can survive that length of time again . " Malone looked across the desk . " And you , Leo ? " Brunner pushed at his glasses nervously . " I do n't know . I can tell you107it is n't easy . There is rarely a week that passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some kind of crisis . To be truthful , I 've never been away from the office more than a week . " " Then it 's time to begin , " said Shively . " Well , if that 's the majority vote , I do n't want to be the lone dissenter , " said Brunner . " I 'll have to try to work it out . " " Settled , " said Malone . He swiveled toward Yost . " We 'll need two weeks of supplies for five people . " " I foresee no problem getting everything laid in well in advance , " said Yost . " We 'll probably be going up to the cabin a couple of times before the big day , and each time we can carry in whatever we need and stock it in the place . As I recall , the cabin is fully furnished . There 's plenty of silverware and plates already there . There are two bedrooms . Vaughn had a master bedroom with a real bed for his wife and himself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets , towels . Then there was a smaller bedroom with bunk beds , a lower and an upper , which he had his kids use . We 'd have to prepare a third bedroom . " " Why three ? " Shively wanted to know . " Well , I assume we 'll let Sharon have the master bedroom , " said Yost . " Two of us go in the bunk bedroom . But we need someplace to sleep two more . There 's one area , I remember , a sort of spare room between the kid 's bedroom and the carport . Vaughn used this spare room for a workshop and to store things . We could move his things out , convertit into the extra bedroom we need , and take turns sleeping there in sleeping bags . We 'd have to get two sleeping bags , but that 's easy to arrange . I have one . We could chip in and buy another one . " " What about chow ? " asked Shively . " We 'd shop for staples in advance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . There 's a going refrigerator for stuff that might spoil . If we run short in the two weeks , I could drive to Arlington or Riverside and pick up some more food . In fact , remembering back , there 's a small shopping arcade in Arlington with a supermarket called Stater 's across from it and there are liquor stores and clothing stores and one or two pharmacies along the main street . So no problem if we run out . " " I do n't like it , " said Shively abruptly . The others seemed surprised . " Do n't like what , Shiv ? " Yost asked . " You or any one of us leaving the hideout to expose ourselves in that town . Its dangerous . " " What the hell , Shiv , " Yost protested . " That 's being too cautious . No our would be I(x)king for us , so no one in Arlington would give a damnabout a stranger 's dropping in to do shopping . Vacationers do it every day as they come off the freeway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " persisted Shively . Yost threw up his hands cheerfully . " Okay , so if it makes you uncomfortable , we do n't do it . We 'll arrange to do all our shopping in advance . " " That 's better , " said Shively . " We 'll just have to make a complete list ahead of time of everything we 'd need , down to the smallest item . Even  --  " Yost suddenly snapped his fingers . " Hey , which reminds me , I almost forgot . I 've got something interesting here . " He brought his briefcase to his lap , opened it , and extracted what appeared to be a document encased in a plastic cover . He unsnapped the cover , and unfurled the set of papers folded inside . " Maybe not as interesting as the income tax return Leo came up with . But kind of useful , I think . " He paused dramatically and dangled the document before them . " Here it is , gentlemen . You are looking at something confidential that very few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fields ' private and personal Life Insurance Policy Number 17131-90 . " Malone 's collector's-eyes widened with awe . " Sharon 's own policy ? " " Nothing else but , taken out two years ago , with her medical report attached . " " How 'd you ever lay hands on that ? " Malone wondered , still impressed . " I thought those policies were kept confidential . " Yost laughed . " Nothing 's confidential anymore , my lad . Everything about everyone is known by someone . In this case , it was easy . Do n't forget , I 'm in the insurance business . Well , my company , Everest Life Insurance Company , is merely one of many subsidiary companies owned by a conglomerate . One of the other companies that the conglomerate owns is Sanctuary Life Insurance and Annuity Company . We all have a common central pool of information on anyone who has at some time or other applied for insurance . Well , Sharon Fields has a Sanctuary policy . I 'm an Everest agent . I went to our pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What 's in it ? " demanded Shively , getting right to the point . " For one thing , it tells us Sharon Fields has never had epilepsy , a nervous breakdown , high blood pressure , tuberculosis . She 's never had any disease or abnormality of the breasts or of menstruation . She 's never used LSD or similar agents . It has her height , weight , measurements . She 's built like the proverbial you-know-what . " " Give them to us , " said Shively . " Sure , pal . " Yost turned several pages of the policy . " Here we haveInuit the way the doctor wrote it down . Sharon Fields . Height  --  five feet six and a half inches . Weight  --  a hundred and sixteen pounds . " He looked up . " And right here , let me throw in a little statistical sidelight I picked out of a movie magazine in the drugstore last night . " He paused to dramatize it . " Sharon Fields ' physical measurements  --  are you ready ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Iloly Jesus ! " Shively exclaimed . - " Forgive me , " Brunner interjected , " but could you define the measure-ments ? " " With pleasure , Leo , with pleasure , " said Yost . " Breasts a very , very full thirty-eight inches . Waist twenty-four inches . Hips thirty-seven inches . " Yost grinned at the others . " Plenty to go around for everyone . " " Je-sus , " said Shively , " that sure turns me on . " Yost nodded , and went back to the policy . " The only thing that 's important for us to know here when we 're buying supplies  --  it 's here under In the past two years have you used barbiturates , sedatives or tranquilizers ? ' The insurance doctor wrote down her reply . Nembutals prescribed by my personal physician . ' I do n't know whether she takes them for tension or for sleep , but we 'd better have some of them on hand for her . " Shively 's thin lips curled crookedly . " Brother , she wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . " Malone frowned at the last , thanked Yost for his contribution , and took up his typed agenda . " Let 's move on , " he said . " Now we come to a vital decision that has to be made . The exact date we undertake this project . Here 's the precise information I have . The most recent announcementmade in Daily Variety was that Sharon flies from Los Angeles to London on the morning of Tuesday , June twenty-fourth . I would suggest we should plan on picking her up the day before , the early morning of Monday , June twenty-third . Does that make sense ? " The other three agreed it did . " Very well , " said Malone . " If the morning of June twenty-third is our target date , that means each of you should arrange to take your two weeks off starting with that Monday , June twenty-third , right on through Saturday , July fifth , the Fourth of July weekend , which is a good time to get her back and return home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he free during that period of time ? " Malone waited . Yost and Brunner were silent , ruminating . Only Shively %poke up. " ( : an do , " he said . " My boss owes me a vacation . Sure , he 's pissed off at Inc light now , but he knows how hard it would be to replace mc , so Igot an idea he 'll go along . If he does n't , well , screw him , I 'll just take off . " " And obviously , the dates are fine for me , " added Malone . " My job at the market is part-time and temporary . I 'll just give the manager notice I 'm leaving . I can always find another spot like that when we get back . " IIe looked at the silent pair . " What about our married men ? Any problem about taking a two-week vacation without your wives ? " Yost rubbed his jaw . " I think I can manage it . I 've done it once or twice before . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention . She might happen to check out the dates of the conventions in Mutual Review  --  one of the trade periodicals I get  --  and then I 'd be in hot water . I was just thinking  --  there 's another way . I could send her down to Balboa to give the children a vacation  --  they 'll be out of school by then  --  and I could tell her I have to use the time to go along with two wealthy insurance prospects on a fishing trip to  --  to the Colorado River . I can say they invited me . Elinor is very insecure . She 'll fall for it . In fact , I 'm almost ready to believe it myself . " " I see only one hole in your story , Howard , " said Malone . " What if your wife wants you to phone her ? Wo n't she expect to hear from you ? " " Yes , sure . Umm , let me see . She knows from the past that when I go off on a hunting or fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no telephones . I 'll say I 'll be up in the backwoods , out of reach . But yes , I would have to phone her just once . I suppose , the day we pull this thing off , we could stop for a minute near Arlington , before we head into the hills . I could call her Balboa motel from a pay phone  --  tell her we 've just arrived at Lake Havasu , and how are the kids , and the clients and myself are about to go downriver to do some fishing and camping . I think that would cover me with roses . " Malone was satisfied . He gave his attention to the last of the four . " What about you , Leo ? " Brunner shook his head worriedly . " Not as simple for me , I 'm afraid . The time is all right . Tax season will be over . I usually give myself a week off , after that , between May and the Fourth , to catch up on odd jobs around the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Disneyland or Marineland . I am not away often without my wife . So Thelma may look upon any request I make to be away from her for so long a period as rather unusual . That 's what I am up against . " " Yes , " said Malone . He then addressed himself to Yost and Shively . " I think Leo 's difficulty is one we should consider seriously . He 'll have to he very convincing with his wife or he might arouse her suspicions , and we 'd all wind up in the soup . It is the thing Sherlock Holmes always usedto warn about . Look out when a person changes his pattern of behavior , fails to act or respond in his normal way . Look out for the unexpected , the different . Like the famous incident in Conan Doyle 's story , Silver Blaze . ' The inspector says to Holmes , Is there any other point to which you would wish to draw my attention ? ' Sherlock Holmes says , To the curious incident of the dog in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clog did nothing in the nighttime . ' And Sherlock Holmes says , That was the curious incident . ' Well , the same thing applies to Leo 's situation . he has never been out of his wife 's sight for one week , let alone two . Now , suddenly , for the first time , he has to be away for two weeks , and alone . Mrs. Brunner would consider that as suspicious as the dog 's not barking in the nighttime . We have to see that Leo handles Mrs. Brunner with care . " " What the hell do we do ? " wondered Shively . Yost shifted his bulk toward Brunner . " Leo , you mean to tell me that accountants do n't have out-of-town conventions or seminars just like insurance agents ? " " Of course , we have meetings and seminars , " said Brunner . " The Society of California Accountants has regional meetings on tax planning all the time . They are usually in November or December , though , not in June . " " Have you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one ? Why , yes  --  three or four years ago  --  I attended a fourdayseries of seminars sponsored by the Institute on Federal Taxation . It was held in  --  in Utah . " " Did your wife go along with you ? " asked Yost . " Of course not . She has no interest in such affairs . " " Well , there you are , " said Yost . " Suppose the Institute on Federal Taxation sponsored a series of seminars in Washington , D.C. , to acquaintCPAs with the new tax laws . Suppose you were invited . Suppose you decided to accept , to improve your knowledge and therefore your future business . Would your wife want to go along ? You said she has no interest in such affairs . " " No , " said Brunner slowly , " no , she does n't . She does n't like to travel anyway . " " Would she be suspicious ? " " She 'd have no reason to be . She might be concerned about the length of t line I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Okay , then , " said Yost . " You 've just been invited to attend seminars w lsore ( I by the Institute in Washington . You 've accepted . You 'll be away from June twenty-third to July fifth . Just tell her . " ... Brunner considered it . " Yes , I could do that . Only  --  only one difficulty I foresee . She 'd expect me to be in touch with her from Washington . I would n't know how to get around that . " " Washington ? " Shively snapped his fingers . " Solved . I can give you an assist there . I have an old girl friend  --  Marcia -- we 're still friends  --  she lives in Baltimore . All you 'd have to do , Leo , is write two or three postcardsin advance to your wife  --  you know  --  ' Darling , I 'm so busy , I 'm finding this interesting , I wish you were here '  --  that kind of crap . I 'd send the cards to Marcia along with a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three times to mail your cards with a Washington postmark . How 's that ? " Brunner was intrigued but had reservations . " What would Marcia think ? Would she be suspicious about what was going on ? " " Her ? " Shively snorted . " Naw , hell , she 's a street girl , on dope to boot , and all she 's curious about is picking up a few bucks any way she can . Leo , you just give me fifty bucks to send her with the postcards , and she would n't give a damn what it 's all about . " " I 'd be willing to do that , " said Brunner . Shively slowed down . " Only one niggle . You 'll have to give your wife the name of a hotel where you 're supposed to be staying , righ ' , ? Let 's say the Mayflower . Well , what 's bothering me is  --  what if your wife calls you there ? " " Thelma call me long-distance in Washington ? " Brunner showed genuineshock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never , she 'd never do that . She 'd never make such an expensive call . She 's extremely frugal by nature . Nor would she expect me to be so extravagant as to telephone her . No , Kyle , that would be no worry . I  --  I think the postcards would be more than sufficient to satisfy her . " From the desk , Malone exhaled his relief . " So that one 's licked . We can all make it on the dates agreed upon . " He nicked a check mark on his agenda sheet . " Which leaves only three more problems to be solved . There 's the matter of changing our appearances before June twenty-third so that we look different when we 're with Sharon . This would protect us later , when we 'd return to the way we look now . She would not be able to recognize us , if it ever came to that . What do you suggest ? For myself , it 's easy . I could let my hair grow longer and also start growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five weeks . " " Okay , " said Shively , " you got the beard . Me , I 'll grow a big moustache . I used to have one . It 'll change my whole looks . " Malone gestured toward Yost , then Brunner . " If you two tried that , would your wives ask questions ? " " Mine might , " said Yost . " I 'd rather not try . Would n't it be better if we wore silk stockings over our faces whenever we 're with her ? " " I think that would be too uncomfortable and scary , " said Malone . " Well , " said Yost , " What about keeping Sharon blindfolded for the two weeks ? " Malone disapproved . " I think that would scare her even more , and alienate her . It would get in the way of our communicating with her . " " Besides , " said Shively with a wicked grin , " I want her to be able to see what she 's getting , lucky girl . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yost , " I guess Leo and I could put on artificial disguises at the last minute . I mean we could stay the way we are until we leave home , then at the last minute alter our appearances with disguises . I could wear dark sunglasses most of the time , and maybe dye my hair and comb it differently just before we grab her . " " It would work , " said Malone . " And you , Leo , I 'd say we could alter your appearance by getting you some kind of hairpiece to paste on or a full wig , and maybe even a small false moustache . And maybe you could do without your glasses in her presence and wear  --  well , less formal clothes  --  no neckties or regular shirts , maybe turtlenecks . Would you mind ? " Brunner seemed entranced by the prospect . " Not in the least , except for the glasses . I 'm pretty nearsighted . I 'd be lost without them . But otherwise , I 'll cooperate . " " Why not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames ? " Yost suggested . " Thick black frames . " " That 's an idea , " said Brunner . " It 's merely for two weeks , " Malone reminded him . " Once we 're finished , once we 've released Sharon , you 'd get rid of the hairpiece and false moustache , return to wearing your metal-framed glasses and more conservative clothes . Howard could discard his shades , rinse out his hair , comb it in his regular style . And Kyle and I , we 'd simply shave off our moustaches and beards and cut our hair . I think it 's foolproof . " " A cinch , " said Shively . He pointed toward Malone 's agenda sheet . " What have n't we covered yet ? " " Second to last problem , " said Malone . " When we pick her up , how do we make her unconscious right away ? " "  --  sy , " said Shively . " We bring along a can of ether or some chloro-form . " " Not ether , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brunner clotted his throat . " Uli , these arc matters 1 pride myself in knowing a little u1x-ut . You see , my wife has frequently been hospitalized or beenunder a physician 's care for various ailments . I 've often attended her in her convalescence . I am quite familiar with The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy . Also , The Home Medical Guide . Of the two anesthetics mentioned , ether is the more risky . It is explosive . The fumes can build up in an enclosed area , and a spark would ignite them . Chloroform , on the other hand , is just as effective and is nonexplosive . " " Where do we get some ? " Yost wanted to know . " At any pharmacy , if you have a legitimate reason for the purchase , " said Brunner . " You could say you require chloroform for the butterflies you want to mount in your butterfly collection . Or  --  " " Forget it , " Shively interrupted . " We ai n't going to any pharmacists  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can get my hands on chloroform with no trouble at all . A young couple I know in Venice , real drug freaks , they 're on everything from uppers and downers to mescaline and nitrous oxide and chloroform and ether . They get some of what they want because she works at one of the free clinics , and she rips off whatever the clinic has that appeals to her . I 'll tell her I want to try some chloroformin my own apartment here . I 'll get it . " " Perhaps I should mention one other fact , " said Brunner . " I do n't wish to add to our problems , but everything must be considered . You must understand that neither chloroform nor ether has a long-term effect . If applied through a mask , rag , handkerchief , it can render the recipient instantly unconscious . But the recipient recovers consciousness rapidly , unless one continues to administer it , and if an overdose is accidentally given , it may prove lethal . It all depends on the length of time Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't timed the drive from Bel Air to the Gavilan Hills hideout yet , Leo , " said Yost . " We 'll know that almost exactly in a week or two . But I 'd say we 'd have to be sure she 's unconscious up to four or five hours , playing it on the safe side . " " Then chloroform wo n't serve your purposes completely , " replied Brunner . " It may be employed as a quick anesthetic agent in the first instance . Following that , you would have to employ a hypodermic injectionwith a longer lasting anesthetic . I 'll try to learn what would be most effective . As to use of a hypodermic , I 'm familiar with that , having administered insulin shots to my wife at home . " " We 'll count on you to check that out , Leo , " said Malone . He studied his agenda sheet for the last time , and pushed it aside . " The final problemto be faced , gentlemen . We pick up Sharon . We remove her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are not in touch with anyone nor is she . ' 1'hc problem . Slit will be missed . She is supposed to 1 ake offfor London the day after she disappears . She undoubtedly has appointmentswith associates and friends . Now , she evaporates into thin air . She 's world-famous . It may create a stir , cause someone to bring in the police  --  " " Of course it will , " agreed Brunner . " So how do we handle that ? " asked Malone . " I have one thought . After we have her in custody , we encourage her to write a letter to Felix Zigman , her manager , or Nellie Wright , her secretary , explaining that she changed her plans , decided to slip away for two weeks of complete rest , and not to worry about her because she 'll be in touch soon . Or we  --  " " I think a letter from Miss Fields would be a mistake , " said Brunner . " It could open up all  --  " " The letter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that leaves us only one alternative , " said Malone . " We depend upon Sharon 's past record for impulsive and erratic behavior . Ever since she became renowned , she has also been notorious for breaking dates , being capricious , disappearing from sight for short periods on sudden whim . There was one occasion several years ago when she simply vanished for about a week . I have clippings in which her disappearance was then likened to that of the evangelist , Aimee Semple McPherson  --  you recall ?  --  who disappeared from sight for days and suddenly returned one day with no acceptable explanation . " " I like that better than our having her write her friends , " said Shively . " Maybe her friends will decide that she just took off , and anyway , she 'd be back before they got too antsy . " Yost , puffing away at his cigar , removed the stogie to speak up . " I was just speculating in my own mind about what would happen after Sharon was finally missed that morning . How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get real worried and go to the police ? " " My guess is that they 'd spend at least a day or two trying to locate her among friends or checking with her old boyfriends , " said Malone . " But if they did n't find her , they 'd certainly go to the police right after that , " persisted Yost . " They probably would , " agreed Brunner , " but they would n't get very far with the police . I know of several cases firsthand , where children or relatives of my clients have disappeared for a period of time . After a while , my clients called the police . They talked first to the Complaint Board . Since there was no evidence of kidnapping or foul play , they were rcfcrrcd to the Missing Persons Bureau in the Detective Section . There they were asked for a full physical description , along with unusualidentifying characteristics , of the missing person . Then they were simply told to wait . The Missing Persons detail proceeded to do a routine check on morgues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same procedure would be followed if Sharon Fields disappeared . Failing to find her , those close to Miss Fields could do little else except to have the police keep an eye out for her . As long as there was no hint , clue , evidence of crime , the police would not be empowered to do anything further . Of course , they might react differently in this case , since Miss Fields is so world-famous  --  " " But that 's just the point , Leo , " Malone broke in . " It 's because Sharon is a movie star that the police would not act . They simply would n't take a report of her being missing seriously . The police are n't complete dummies . They 'd know Sharon 's past record . They 'd also know Sharon had a big epic movie , The Royal Harlot , about to go into release . They 'd regard any report of her disappearance as just another PR stunt , in fact one of the oldest in history , one that 's been used time and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . You can be sure of that . We do n't have to worry about the police getting into this . And even if they did  --  where could they start to look ? " " Right you are , " said Yost . " I think we fully agree that 's the least of our problems . " Malone arose from the chair and stretched . " I 'd say we 're set . We 've asked ourselves every question possible . We know what to do about each one . We should have them answered , every problem solved , in the next three or four weeks . I say we should proceed with our assignments , and then get together at least twice a week for the next month to work out final details . Everyone agreeable ? " Everyone was on his feet and all were agreeable . Shively reached out to take Brunner 's arm . " Leo , old man , before we split , one last question . You know that income tax thing of Sharon Fields you were reading from before ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thing you did n't tell us from it . I 'm a little curious about a chick like that . What did she earn last year ? " " Earn ? " Brunner lifted his attache case to the table , opened it , and brought out the IRS report . " Do you mean Miss Fields ' gross income or net taxable income ? " " Just tell me in plain English what she gets paid for looking the way she looks . " " Well , " said Brunner , turning the pages of the IRS form , " Miss Fields ' earnings  --  her gross income for the last tax year  --  was one million117two hundred twenty-nine thousand four hundred fifty-one dollars and ninety cents . " Shively stood blinking . " You 're kidding . " " Mr. Shively , Miss Fields earned upwards of a million and a quarter dollars for that one year . " Shively gave a low , long whistle . " Wow , " he said at last . He looked at each of the others with a Cheshire cat grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not only lining up the most desired hunk of flesh in history  --  but we 're getting ourselves the most expensive piece of ass on earth for free . I low long did you say before it happens , Adam ? Only five weeks to go ? Well , I tell you , I ca n't wait . I 've always wanted to fuck a gold mine . I just keep wondering  --  what 's it going to be like ? " 4 . Adam Malone 's Notebook  --  May 18 to May 24 : IN A SECONDHAND BOOK I bought , entitled Redder Than the Rose and written by Robert Forsythe , I have found the following quotation attributed to the playwright Robert E. Sherwood : " Imagine the plight of a Hollywood heroine , a not too complex cutie who has been boosted suddenly to a dizzy eminence and is rather puzzled by it all . She awakens in the night with the realization , At this moment I am being subjected to vicarious rape by countless hordes of Yugoslays , Peruvians , Burmese , Abyssinians , Kurds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any wonder that a girl in that predicament finds it difficult to lead a normal life , that her sense of balance is apt to be a bit erratic ? " I have been thinking of this in relation to Sharon Fields . On the surface , it seems to offer an insight into the lives of many beautiful young movie actresses who have become international sex symbols . It tends to explain their sometimes confused and unusual public behavior . But as one who has probed so deeply into the psyche of Sharon Fields , I do not feel the remark or comment applies to her . Or at least its conclusion does not . It may be true that Sharon does sometimes wake up in the middle of the night  --  so to speak  --  conscious that millions of males throughout the world , in love with her flickering image on the silver screen , desire her , and that in their secret minds they subject her to vicarious rape . But , from my knowledge of her , in no way has this predicament or her realizationof it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levelheaded as any young woman on earth who knows she is attractive to men and accepts it as an accident of nature , as she might accept other natural gifts like intelligence , wit , poise . If on some occasions in the past Sharon has acted outrageously or impulsivelyin public , I think it is the result of her refusing to be shackled to an unreal image . She wants to be herself , not what she is supposed to be . So now and then she revolts . She asserts her independence . In effect , she tries to tell everyone I am me . The fact that she has daringly told the world , time and again , that she prefers men like ourselves to the glamour figures she is expected to associate with merely gives validity to my point. **25;1735;TOOLONG to be , then I brushed at the spots on the burgundy sweat shirt she had brought home for me one day , happily taking it from the bag and holding it up for me to see . Then I stood up and walked quickly out the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late , the door was already swinging to and the glass bounced off the screen and hit the floor . Somehow it did n't break . I crossed the lawn , onto the sidewalk that sloped down with the street ; a half block from the house I was suddenly afraid she was coming , I felt her behind me , and I turned , but the sidewalk was empty and lovely in the shadows of maples and elms . I went on . If there was a way to call Edith and she could come get me . But of course no . I could go back and get my car , the keys were in my pocket , I could start it and be gone before Terry came running out with a Goddamn knife , if I drove to Edith 's and parked in front of the house and looked up at the window where she slept beside Hank she would know , if I waited long enough watching her window she would know in her sleep and she would wake and look out the windowat me under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the damp lawn . I came to a corner and went up another street . Edith , ' I whispered into the shadows of my diagonal walk , oh Edith sweet baby , I love you , I love you forever . ' I thought about forever and if we live afterward , then I saw myself laid out in a coffin , the beard and hair lovely white . I stopped and leaned against a car , dew on its fender cool through my slacks . Natasha and Sean and I looked at Terry in her coffin . I stood between them holding their small hands . Terry 's smooth cheeks were pale against her red hair . When she told me she was pregnant she was n't afraid . She was twenty years old . It was a cold bright Thursday in January , the sky had been blue for a week and the snow in Boston was dirty and old . We went to a bookstore on Boylston Street and bought paperbacks for each other , then we had steamers and draft beer in a dim place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing boats in harbor on the walls . For some reason the waiters wore leather tunics . In those days Terry always seemed happy . I can close my eyes any time and remember how I loved her and see and feel her as she took my hand on the table and said : After today I 'll be careful about eating , and if I promise not to get fat and if I get a job , can I keep our baby ? ' Now I started walking home . We were , after all this , the same Jack and Terry , and I would go to her now and touch her and holdp7her ; I walked faster , nodding my head yes yes yes . Then going into the dark living room I felt her in the house like the large and sharpenededge of a knife . She was asleep . I crept into the bedroom and lay beside her , at the edge of the bed so we did n't touch . Natasha and Sean woke Terry early for breakfast but I stayed in bed , held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the sun got higher and the room hotter until it was too hot and I got up . I went straight to the shower without seeing anyone . While I was drying myself she tapped on the door . ' Do you want lunch or breakfast ? ' Her voice had the practiced sweetness she assumed when she was afraid : strangers got it , and I got it after some fights or when she made mistakes with money . For an instant I was tender and warm and I wanted to help her with a cheerful line ( Oh , I 'll have you for breakfast , love ; just stick a banana in it and hop in bed ) ; but then sure as time is a trick I was sitting in the kitchen last night , and the bourbon and ice were flying at me . ' I do n't know , ' I said . Through the door I could feel the tone of my voice piercing her . What do you have ? ' Just cereal if you want breakfast . But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and me ; the kids do n't like them anyway . ' ' No , I have to hurry . I 'm taking the car in . ' Linhart , I said to my face in the mirror . You are a petulant son of a bitch . Why do n't you drag her in here and whip her ass then eat lobster with her . She was still waiting outside the door ; I pretended not to know , and went about drying myself . ' I could go to the fish market and be back and have them done in thirty minutes . Forty to be safe . ' ' I have to get the car there at twelve . ' You have to ? ' ' If I want the work done , yes . ' ' What 's the work ? ' ' Oil and grease . ' ' That does n't take long . ' ' They 're busy , " Terry . They want it at twelve or not at all . They do n't care how badly you want a lobster . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . ' ' I do n't want one by myself . ' ' What , you mean it wo n't taste good ? ' ' Oh , you know u hat I rtn'an , ' in that smock-whine you hear fromp8girls everywhere when they 're being lovingly teased . I started brushing my teeth . Cheerios or Grape Nuts ? ' Grape Nuts . ' She went away . When I came dressed to the kitchen the table was set neatly for one : a red straw place mat , a deep bowl which had the faint sparkle of fresh washing , a spoon on a napkin , a glass of orange juice . She was upstairs with the vacuum cleaner . Over in the sink were the children 's breakfast dishes , unwashed ; beneath them were last night 's dishes . Terry is the toy of poltergeists : washer , dryer , stove , refrigerator , dishes , clothes , and woolly house dust . The stove wants cleaning and as she lifts off burners the washing machine stops in the wash room ; she leaves the stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ; it is a white load , bagged in a sheet , lying on the kitchen floor since before breakfast . She unloads the washing machine and , hugging the wet clothes to her breasts , she opens the dryer ; but she has forgotten , it 's full of clothes she dried last night . She lays the wet ones on top of the dryer and takes out the dry ones ; these she carries to the living room and drops in a loose pile on the couch ; a pair of Sean 's Levi 's falls to the floor and as she stoops to pick it up she sees a bread crust and an orange peel lying in the dust under the couch . She can not reach them without lying on the floor , so she tells herself , with the beginnings of panic , that she must do the living room this morning : sweep , dust , vacuum . But there are clothes waiting to be folded , and a new load going into the dryer , another into the washer . Going through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusted burners lying on greasy white porcelain . In the wash room she puts the wet clothes into the dryer , shuts the door , and starts it , a good smooth sound of machine , the clothes turning in the dark . In fifty minutes they will be dry . It is all so efficient , and standing there listening to the machine , she feels that efficiency , and everything seems in order now , she is in control , she can rest . This lasts only a moment . She loads the washer , turns it on , goes back to the kitchen , averts her eyes from the stove and makes for the coffee pot ; she will first have a cup of coffee , gather herself up , plan her morning . With despair she sees it is not a morningbut an entire day , past cocktail hour and dinner , into the night : when the dinner dishes arc done she will have more clothes to fold and some to iron . ' this happens often and forces her to watch televisionwhile she works . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes are in the sink , last night 's pots are on the counter : hardened mashed potatoes , congealed grease . She hunts for the coffee cup she 's been using all morning , finds it on the lavatory in the bathroom , and empties the cold coffee over the dishes in the sink . She lights a cigarette and thinks of some place she can sit , some place that will let her drink a cup of coffee . There is none , there 's not a clean room downstairs ; upstairs the TV room is clean enough , because no one lives there . But to climb the stairs for a sanctuary is too depressing , so she goes to the living room and sits on the couch with the clean clothes , ignores the bread crust and orange peel whispering to her from the floor . Trying to plan her work for the day overwhelms her ; it is too much . So she does what is at hand ; she begins folding clothes , drinking coffee , smoking . After a while she hears the washer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash room , brings back the dry clothes , goes back and puts the wet load in the dryer . When I come in for lunch , the living room is filled with clothes : they are in heaps on chairs , folded and stacked on the couch and floor ; I look at them and then at Terry on the couch ; beyondher legs are the bread crust and orange peel ; with a harried face she is drinking coffee , and the ash tray is full . Is it noon already ? ' she says . Her eyes are quick with panic . Oh Goddamnit , I did n't know it was that late . ' I walk past her into the kitchen : the burners , the dishes . Jesus Christ , ' I say . We fight , but only briefly , because it is daylight , we are n't drinking , the children will be in from playing soon , hungry and dirty . Like our marriage , I think , hungry and dirty . While I ate the Grape Nuts , Natasha and Sean came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the door at once , the screen slamming behind them . Natasha is nine ; she is the love child who bound us . Sean is seven . Looking at them I felt love for the first time that day . You slept late , ' Sean said . That 's because you were up late , you guys were fighting , ' Natasha said . I heard you . ' What did you hear ? ' ' I do n't know  --  ' She was hiding whatever it was , down in her heart angry words breaking into her sleep . Yelling and swear words and then you left . ' ' You left ? ' Scan said . Ile was simply interested , not worried . He lives his own life . I lc eats and sleeps with us , comes to us when he needs something , but he lives outside wit Ii boys and bicycles.  |p10All  grown-ups fight from time to time . If they 're married . ' I know , ' Sean said . Where 's Mom ? ' I pointed to the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to eat , ' he said . Let her work . I 'll fix it . ' You 're eating , ' Natasha said . I 'll hurry . ' Is that your lunch ? ' Sean said . Grape Nuts ? ' It 's my supper . ' I asked what they had done all morning . It was hard to follow and I did n't try ; I just watched their loud faces . They interrupted each other : Natasha likes to draw a story out , lead up to it with history ( Well see , first we thought we 'd go to Carol 's but then they were n't home and I remembered she said they were going  --  ' ) . Sean likes to tell a story as quickly as he can , sometimes quicker . While they talked , I made sandwiches . It was close to noon but I lingered ; Natasha was stirring Kool-Aid in a pitcher . In twelve minutes Edith would be waiting at the Shell station , but I stood watching them eat , and I hoped something would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she would . An advantage of an affair with a friend 's wife was the matter of phone calls : there was nothingsuspicious about them . If Edith called and talked to Terry I 'd know she could n't see me this afternoon . I asked the children if they wanted dessert . Do we have any ? ' Natasha said . We never have dessert , ' Sean said . I looked in the freezer compartment for ice cream , then in the cupboard for cookies , sweets to sweeten my goodbye , and there were none . Sean was right : we never had desserts because I did n't like them and Terry liked them too much ; she controlled her sweet tooth by having nothing sweet in the house . I 'm sorry , ' I said . I knew I was being foolish but I could n't stop . I 'm a stupid daddy . I 'll bring some dessert home with me . ' Where you going ? ' Natasha said . To get the car worked on , ' my voice jumping to tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He had a moustache of grape Kool-Aid . Me too , ' Natasha said . No , it takes a long time , then I 'm going to run with Hank . ' ' We do n't mind , ' Natasha said . We 'll watch you . '  |p11There  is not one God , I thought . There are several , and they all like jests . No you wo n't , ' I growled , and went at her with fingers curled like talons , then tickled her ribs ; her sandwich dropped to her plate , she became a fleshed laugh . Because after we run we 're going to a bar and drink beer . It 's what mean old men do . ' They were laughing . Now I could leave . Then Terry came downstairs , one of my old shirts hanging out , covering her shorts . I want us to start having desserts . ' What ? ' Tay ! ' Sean said . Desserts . ' We never have desserts , ' Natasha said . Terry stood looking at us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're depriving the kids of a basic childhood experience . ' What 's that ? ' Mother 's desserts . ' Jesus . ' I wished she were the one going off , to wickedness ; I would stay home and make cookies from a recipe book . Well , I 'm off . ' I kissed their Kool-Aid mouths , touched lips with Terry , and went out . She followed me to the screen door . Did you get enough to eat ? ' Sure . Not as good as lobster , ' talking over my shoulder , going down the steps , but cheaper anyway . ' She did n't answer . In the car I thought adultery is one thing , but being a male bitch waging peripheral war is another , this poison of throwing gift-lobsters at your wife 's vulnerable eyes , drying up her sweetness and hope by alluding to the drought of the budget . Which was also a further , crueler allusion to her awful belief in a secular gospel of good news : we were Americans , nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and we deservedto eat lobsters the day after a fight , just as we deserved to sec plays in Boston and every good movie that came to town , and when I told her there was no money she was not bitter , but surprised . She was also surprised when the bank told her we were overdrawn and she found that she had forgotten to record a check , or when someone wrote her about a bill that lay unopened in her desk.  |p12When  I got to the Shell station Edith was parked across the street . I told the man to change the oil and grease it . ' I ' 11 go run some errands with the wife , ' I said , thumbing over my shoulder at Edith . Then I 'll come pick it up . ' He looked across the street at Edith . Keys in the car ? ' I slapped my pockets . Yes . ' I wondered what twelve months of daylight would do to adulterers . In daylight it seemed everyone knew : the fat man in the greasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a new filter and grease , the women who drove by and glanced at me as I waited to cross the street , and the little suntanned boy , squinting up at me , pulling a wagon with his tricycle on the sidewalk beside her car . I got in and said : He knows too . ' Who ? ' That kid . He knows where we 're going . ' She drove through the city . It is built on the Merrimack , which is foul , and the city itself is small , ugly , and has the look of death , as a man with cancer does . The industry was shoes , but the factories have been closing . On the main street the glass-fronted stores , no matter their size , all have the dismal look of pawn shops or Army surplus stores . But urban renewal has started : on the riverbank they have destroyed some old gray wooden buildings ; in their place a shopping center will be built , and then as we stop at the red light and look toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide glass windows , and specials posted on the glass of the supermarket , and the asphalt parking lot with cars , shopping carts , and unhappy women . Our city is no place for someone who is drawn to suicide . When Edith got to the divided highway I twisted around and opened the ice chest on the floor in the back . Already we had a ritual like husband and wife : it was for me to begin the drive by opening two beers , lighting two cigarettes . Today she had added something : two Lowenbraiis , two Asahis , and two San Miguels angled up at me in the ice . She brings such presents , ' I said , and kissed her cheek . Cold presents from a cold woman . ' An opener was in the glove compartment , under one of her scarves that was red and soft like pants in my hand . The Asahisp13opened with a pop . Edith glanced in the rear-view mirror , swallowed , then took the lighted cigarette from my fingers . I think I 'll change to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . Why not just let him babysit for us . ' We avoided naming them : we said he , she , him , her . He 'd be glad to . ' Well she would n't , sweetheart . ' I told her about the fight ; the sun was warm on my face and arm at the window , the air smelled of trees and grass , we were driving in rolling wooded country under a blue sky , and I was too happy to care about last night . I told it quickly . I think he wants to make love with her , ' she said . Why ? ' Why ? Because she 's pretty and he likes her and he has n't had any strange since Jeanne . Why do you think ? ' I mean why do you think he wants to ? ' The way he looks at her . And the way he looked when we came back from getting beer last night . ' Guilty ? ' Sheepish . Does that bother you ? ' Not me . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling , her eyes bright . She blooms , she blooms , ' I said . And in May you were so hurt . ' In May I was alone . ' I am surrounded by painful marriages that no one understands . But Hank understands his , and I think for him it has never been painful ; the pain was Edith 's , and she came to me with it in May , at a party . When she asked me to go outside I knew she had finally caught Hank , and because she is small and her voice soft I saw her as vulnerable , and I felt she lacked the tough spirit to deal with adultery . First I found Terry in the kitchen so she would n't miss me , then start looking about to see which woman was missing too . I told her where I was going and she understood too that Edith had finally caught on ; she looked at me with that veiled excitement we feel in the face of other people 's disasters . In the backyard , away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a picnic table . You probably already know this , I guess Terry does too and everybody else : about I lank and that phony French bitch that sonicbodv brought to our Christmas party  --  ' ' Jeanne . '  |p14And  they crashed that party . ' She touched my shirt pocket for a cigarette . I forgot my purse inside . Bumming cigarettes , that 's how I first got suspicious : he 'd come home with Parliaments , I guess they lay around in bed so long he smoked all his , and now I do n't know what to do , I ca n't stand to see him naked , I keep thinking of  --  shit : I ought to divorce him , I could do that but I do n't really want to , but why should n't I ? When he does n't love me . ' She stopped . My arm was around her ; I patted her shoulder , then squeezed her against my side . There was a time in my life when I believed I could help people by talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several people , most of them young girls who were my students . People told me about marriages , jobs , parents , and boyfriends , and I listened and talked a lot and never helped anyone at all . So now if someone comes to me I offer what I know I can give : the friendship of a listening face . That night I held Edith and listened and said very little . After a while she jumped down from the table and walked toward the shadows of the house . She was wearing a white dress . I was about to call to her when she stoppedand stood smoking with her back turned . Then she came back to the table . You 're good to me . ' I have n't helped you any . ' She stood looking up at me . I got down from the table and held her , pressing her face to my chest and stroking her hair , then we kissed and she squeezed me tightly , her hands moved on my back , and her tongue darted in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come see me . ' Yes . ' Monday afternoon . ' Are you sure ? ' Yes . Yes , I want you to . Come at one . ' Next day was Sunday , and all day while the sun was up I did n't believe Edith , and I did n't believe what I had felt holding her , but after dinner in the night I went for a walk and I believed all of it again , and that night in bed I lay awake for a long time , like a child before a birthday . After my twelve o'clock class Monday I drove to Edith 's . When she opened the door I knew from her face that she had been waiting . Now the place we were going to , the place we always went to after that first afternoon in her house , was a woods off a highway inp15New Hampshire : down a wide , curving dirt road , dry and dusty , then she parked in the shade and I opened two San Miguels , got the blanket from the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine needles slippery underfoot . I timidly held her hand . I prefer adultery to be a collision : suddenly and without thinking alone with a woman , an urgent embrace , buckles , zippers , buttons . Walking up through the trees gave me time to watch Terry taking the lunch dishes from the table , stacking them on the counter by the sink , and with a distracted , troubled face starting to wash the dishes from three meals . At the knoll 's top I lay the blanket under pines and a tall hemlock and heard behind me the buttons of her shorts ; I turned and , kneeling , pulled the shorts down her warm brown legs . She took her shirt off and reached back for the clasp of her brassiere ; then she lay on the blanket and watched me until I was naked , lying beside her with the sun shining over the crown of a gray birch onto my face . What 'll we do in winter , ' she said . In the car , like kids . ' If we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : When fall comes we 'll make love in the car and when winter comes we 'll fog the windows and make love wearing sweaters and in spring we 'll be back here on this blanket on this hill . ' Promise me . ' I promise . ' Then I was alone thinking of a year of deceiving Terry and Hank and the others whom you do n't and ca n't watch out for because they 're faceless and nameless , but they 're always watching you . I could feel Edith knowing what I was thinking . I promise . ' I know you do . No , lie down , love . I want to be on top . There . I cllo , love . ' I reached up for her breasts and watched her face , eyes tightly shut , lips parted , and the long black hair falling across her right cheek , strands of it in her mouth , and she tossed her head , neck arching , and the hair fell back over her shoulder . Then I shut my eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a while we were still , then I opened my eyes to the sun and her face . ' I do n't Want to move yet , ' she said . ' I want to sit here and drip on you . ' Alrcadv I could feel it . ' Can you get the beer ? '  |p16I  reached behind me and gave her a bottle and watched her throat as she swallowed . I raised my head to drink from mine . You 're much faster now , ' she said . On that afternoon in May we went to the guest room , downstairs at the rear of the house , and after an hour I gave up . We had our shins on and I was wearing socks . Are you sure you ca n't ? ' she said . I keep listening for Sharon to come down or Hank to walk in . ' You 're sure that 's all it is ? ' That 's plenty enough . ' We went outside and sat on lawn chairs in the sun . After a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feet . I said I would see her tomorrow , at the shopping center north of town , just over the New Hampshire line ; then I went home happy and Terry said : You must have had a good day in class . ' I avoided her eyes until she turned back to the stove , then I looked at her long red hair and like singing I thought : I will love them both . I said I would go take a shower , and I went to our bedroom : the bed was unmade and a pair of her Levi 's and a shirt were on the floor , and I had to step over the vacuum cleaner to get into the bathroom , where two wet towels lay on the floor but no clean ones in the closet , and I yelled at her : Could I have a Goddamn towel ! ' That night I read in the living room until she was asleep , and next afternoon Edith and I found this road and woods and hill , and that time it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry at home , and Edith kept working with me until finally I came in spite of thinking , it was like some distant part of me coming , like the semen itself had decidedit was tired of waiting , and it spurted out just to give us all a rest . For two or three weeks I was like that , then all at once one day I was n't , as though even guilt and fear could not survive the familiarityof passion . Now Edith lay beside me and we drank beer going tepid and smoked lying naked in the sun . Do n't let it get sunburned , ' she said . You 'll get caught . ' Poor limp thing . ' ' I ' 11 keep the sun off . ' No . I ca n't . ' Yes you can . ' I 'm an old man . ' You 're my young lover . Your stomach 's growling ; have you eaten lunch ? '  |p17Gra|pe  Nuts . I slept late . ' You should live with me . I 'd feed you better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She feeds me what I want . ' You taste like me . ' A squirrel darted up the hemlock . After a while I said , Wait . ' I stroked her arm , then tugged it , and she moved up beside me . I was on her , in her , taking a long time , the sun on my back , sweating against her belly , listening to the monologue of moans . Did you ? ' I said . Yes . I want you to . ' Her tongue-moistened fingers went up to my nipples . She had taught me I had those . ' Oh love , ' she said . Again ? ' ' I think so . Yes . God , yes . ' She took me with her and I collapsed on her damp belly and breasts and listened to the pounding of her heart . ' It felt like spurting blood , ' I said . Did it hurt ? ' ' I could n't tell . ' ' My young lover . ' ' I 'm starving . ' You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . ' ' No , you have to be strong , taking care of two women . Would you like to live with me ? ' ' Yes . ' ' I 'd like to live with you . We should all rent one big house . ' ' And who 'd mop up the blood ? ' ' ' lucre would n't be any blood . ' ' She 'd cut my throat . ' I got up and dressed and went down to the car for the LOwenbraiis , then back up the slope treasuring my hard climbing calf muscles ; now I wanted to run . She was dressed , lying on her back , her hands at her sides , eyes closed , face to the sun . I wonder how we 'll get caught , ' she said . ' He 'll smell you when I undress . ' ' I mean Terry . If he caught us I would n't care , I would n't stop unless you wanted to . You probably would . You 'd be embarrassed . ' ' Maybe not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit Inc into your life , but it 's hardp18for you , and if you got caught you 'd throw me out . But you 're part of my life : you 're what allows me to live with Hank . ' Am I a what ? I do n't want to be a what . ' I held up the LOwenbraii . This is one . It 's what 's going to make me belch for the first mile . ' You 're my lovely what . ' Good old Jack , just part of the family . ' Sure . You make me a good wife . If I did n't love you I 'd have to love someone else . We married too young  --  ' We all did . ' Once at a party Terry was in the kitchen with Edith and two other wives . They came out grinning at the husbands : their own , the others . They had all admitted to shotgun weddings . That was four years ago and now one couple is divorced , another has made a separate peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and there are the Allisons and the Linharts . A deckstackingexample , but the only one I know . He needs us , Sharon and me , but he ca n't really love anyone , only his work , and the rest is surface . ' I do n't believe that . ' I do n't mean his friendship with you . Of course it 's deep , he does n't live with you , and best of all you 're a man , you do n't have those needs he ca n't be bothered with . He 'd give you a kidney if you needed one . ' He 'd give it to you too . ' Of course he would . But he would n't go to a marriage counselor . ' You funny girl . After a long carnivorous fuck you talk about a marriage counselor . Who are you , sweetheart ? ' My name is Edith Allison and I 'm the leader of the band . I wanted to go to a marriage counselor so he 'd talk . Because he would n't talk just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been screwing Jeanne , now he 'd stopped , and that was that . ' What more did you want ? ' You know what I wanted . Remember me back in May ? I still believed in things . I wanted to know where we were , what Jeanne meant . Now that I have you I know what she meant : that he does n't love me . You love the person you 're having the affair with . But it does n't matter now , I can live with him like that , on the surface . He 'll be busting out again soon . He 's been hibernating with that novel since he broke off with Jeanne . Before long he 'll look around and blink and screw the first thing that rall:s into his office . '  |p19Jesus  . I hope somebody goes in before I do . ' He 'd probably do that too . ' Now , now : bitchy bitchy . ' Well , he screws his wife once in a while , so why not another man . ' He screws you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I hear you can go to St. Louis and screw for that man and woman who wrote the book . The one about coming . ' Really ? ' Sure . They watch you and straighten out your hang-ups . ' Let 's you and I go . I 'd like them to watch us . We 'd make them hot . ' You might get rid of your guilt . Do you good . ' Why spoil my fun ? Maybe you 'd learn to come more . ' What would a wee dirty lass like you have told a marriage coun-selor ? ' I was trying to keep from being a wee dirty lass . I 'm glad now I did n't . What are you doing ? ' Touching you . ' Is n't it getting late ? ' I do n't know . ' Can you again ? ' I do n't know . ' We left our shirts on , a wrong move : they reminded us that time was running out . My back hurt but I kept trying ; Edith did n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . ' Our shirts were wet . We gathered up the bottles , the cigarettes , the blanket . In the car she made up her face . ' What 'll you do with the bottles ? ' I said . I think I 'll burn candles in them at dinner . And if he notices  --  which he would n't  --  I 'll tell him they 're souvenirs from this afternoon . Along with my sore pussy . ' ' He 'll see them in the garbage . You know , when he empties it or something . ' She started the car and grinned at me , almost laughing . And then what , Charlie Chan ? ' ' He 'll wonder why in the hell you drank six bottles of imported beer this afternoon . ' ' Well , he does n't deserve honesty , but a few clues might be nice . ' ' Sometimes I think- '  |p20It  was possible she wanted him to catch her ; you have to keep that in mind when you 're making love with a man 's wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes you think what ? ' Sometimes I think I love you even more than I think I do . Which is a lot . ' Which is a lot . Impotent as you are , you try hard . ' She turned the car around and drove slowly and bouncing out of the woods . At the highway she stopped and put on sunglasses . Light me a Lucky , ' she said . My last one till  --  ? ' I thought of the acting and the lies and , right then , if she had said we must stop seeing each other , I would have been relieved . I do n't know , I 'll call you . ' As she drove onto the highway both of us pretended we were n't eyeing the road for friends ' cars . My damp shirt and chest cooled in the air blowing through the window . My pecker aches . ' I 'm going to keep the sitter another hour and take a nap . ' Let me give you some money for her . ' Another time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chest . ' I 'll go by the dump . ' Summer school was in session , and walking downtown you 'd see college girls licking ice cream cones . Once I was teaching Goodbye , Columbus and a blonde girl with brown eyes like a deer stopped me at the door before class and said : Mr. Linhart , what is oral love ? ' She was licking a lollipop . I looked away from her tongue on the lollipop and said fellatio ; when she asked what that was I mumbled in the heat of my face that she ought to ask a girl . It took me a couple of hours to know she was having fun with me . After that I tried to talk to her but she had only wanted that fun ; she had a boyfriendwho waited every day in the hall outside our classroom , and seeing them holding hands and walking down the hall I felt old and foolish . That was three years ago , when I was twenty-seven . On summer afternoons there were no classes , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three flights of stairs in the old , cool building Hank would be working with his back to the open door ; he 'd hear me coming and he 'd turn smiling , stacking and paper-clipping the manuscript . Hi , ' he 'd say , his voice affectionatelike he was talking to a woman or a child . There are severalp21men I love and who love me , all of us married , passive misogamists , and if we did not have each other to talk to we would probably in our various ways go mad . But our love embarrasses us ; we show our affection in reverse : Where you been , you sonofabitch ? Look at that bastard , he would n't buy a round for Jesus Christ  --  But Hank only did that if it made you feel better . Hi , ' he said . You ca n't write , you fucker , so let 's go run . ' One Goddamn page . ' In four hours ? ' Three hours and forty-six minutes . Let 's go . ' I started walking downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Walking over to the gym he was quiet . By the flagpolehe lit a cigarette , then flung it to the sidewalk , crumpled his pack and threw it hard , like an outfielder ; it arched softly , red and white in the sun . You just quit . ' Goddamn right . ' Which time ? ' For the last time . ' ' You wo n't make it . ' ' You watch . They 're pissing me off . They 're trying to kill me . ' They have no souls . ' Exactly . ' So they 're not trying to kill you . ' Not the cigarettes . I mean the fuckers that make ' em . ' here were tennis players in the locker room . We had lockers next to each other and I glanced at him as he pulled up his jockstrap then gym shorts . ' Jesus , do n't you ever get fat ? ' I said . ' I 'm fat now . ' He pinched some tight flesh at the back of his waist . ' Bullshit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred my flabbier waist and smaller cock . But sometimes I believed it and , when I did , I felt wonderful . ' You smell like beer , man . ' I had a couple . ' I 'll carry you in . ' ' Watch me go , baby . On the clipped grass behind t he gym we did push-ups and sit-ups . and side-straddle hops , then started jogging on a blacktop road that would take us into the country . Five ? ' I said . I ought a do ten . Run off my Goddamn frustration . ' A page a day 's not bad . ' Shit . ' It was a hot , still day . We ran easily , stride for stride , past the houses where children waved and called to us and women looked up from their lawns or porches . I belched a couple of times and he grinned and punched my arm . Then the houses were n't close togetheranymore , the country was rolling and we climbed with it , pounding up the blacktop , not talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level we talked : Goddamn , there 's that lovely orchard . ' Hold your breath , mothuh , here comes the hog stench . ' Jesus , look at that cock pheasant . ' Then he was all right , he had forgotten his work , he was talking about shooting pheasants in Iowa , walking through frozen cornfields , the stalks lying brown in the sun . We ran to the top of a wooded hill two and a half miles from the gym and started back , still stride for stride : it would be that last two hundred yards when he 'd kick . We ran downhill through sudden cool shade between thick woods ; in fall the maple leaves turned orange and yellow and scarlet , and it was like peeping at God . Then on our left the woods stopped , and the hog smell lay on the air we breathed as we ran past the cleared low hills and the barn , chickens walking and pecking in front of it , then past the hog pen and the gray shingled house . A white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had missed us on the way up , and now he chased us until he was almost at our legs , then we looked back at him and yelled Hey white dog ! ' and he trotted away , looking back at us over his shoulder , sometimes stopping to turn and bark . Runninghas taught me that most dogs are cowards . But there used to be a Doberman pinscher living on this road : he loped after us so quietly that we never knew he was there until we heard his paws on the road and we 'd yell and turn on him and crouch to fight , watching him decide whether he wanted to chew on us . He always looked very detached ; that 's what scared us . Then he 'd trot back down the road , dignity intact ; we were glad when last year he moved away . All the other dogs were like the white one at the farmhouse . Past the farm there were trees again , pines motionless in the still air , and then to the right , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're a little screwed up this summer , ' hank said.  |p23Do  I look it ? ' ' Yep . ' Should 've taught summer school . ' Maybe not . ' Thought I would n't this year . Needed a break , I thought . Now I need the money . ' Need the work more . ' Bothers me . You 'd think a man would do something . All that time . Read . Even think . Noble fucking pursuits . I run errands . Makes me wonder what 'd happen if I did n't have to make a living . ' You 'll never find out . ' Good . Probably mean suicide . Man ought to be able to live with himself . Idly . Without going mad . Women do it . ' Not so well . ' Work is strange . ' All there is . ' This . This is good . ' ' Best of all . ' We stopped talking and right away my head was clear and serene , I was lungs and legs and arms , sun on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my forehead , drippingto my eyes , burning , and I flicked it away with a finger . At the houses near the college he moved ahead of me , a pace or two . I caught him and ran beside him for a while , then he kicked and was gone ; I stretched my legs , arms swinging , breath in gasps , and watched his back ten then twenty yards away as he sprinted past the gym and slowed and walked , head going up and down for air , hands on his hips . I walked beside him . He did n't smile at beating me , but I felt a smile as though in his rushing breath . Competitive bastard , ' I said . I'hen he smiled , and I believed then he knew I was making love with Edith and he was telling me he knew , saying , You see Edithca n't touch me and you ca n't either , what matters here is what matters to me and what matters to me is I will write and I will outrunyou and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I am . He did n't smoke , either . After the shower , a long time of hot water on the shoulders and legs and back muscles , then warm then cool , we drank Heineken draft in tall frosted mugs . We were alone in the bar , then a thin bald man came in carrying wrapped fish . Adjacentto the lounge was the dining room , where people ate fish from the sea and looked out at the dirty Merrimack ; if you walkedp24out of the lounge , across the hall , you went into the fish market . Before starting to drink , Hank and I had gone in and stood in the smell of fish , looking at the lobsters in a tank . I thought of Terry , but not with guilt ; I had loved and run and sweated that out of me . I stood shifting my weight from one leg to another so I could feel the muscles , and I breathed my own clean smell with the salt water and fish , and resolved not to smoke for an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had after running restored innocence to my lungs ; and I loved and wanted to embrace Edith and Hank and Terry , who in their separate ways made my life good . I felt at the border of some discovery , some way I could juggle my beloveds and save us all . But I did n't know what it was . The man with the fish sat to our left , put his fish on the bar , and ordered a Schlitz . Betty was tending bar ; she was a middle-aged blonde who had lived all her life in this town . She sat on a high stool near the taps and talked to the fish man . He looked at the I-lcinckcn sign over the mirror and asked if that was imported beer ; she said yes it was . He said he 'd never heard of it and she told him oh yes , it was quite popular , it sold ten to one here . Schlitz , ' Hank said , so they could n't hear . Some people like it better inside the horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Yeah , l saw her . ' He gave me the foxy smile I got after he beat me running . ' To tell her goodbye ? ' ' Remember when I went to New York to see my agent ? ' ' Ah . I did n't know you could lie so well . ' He held out two dollars to the woman . ' We 'll have a round , and give my friend on the end a Heineken . ' The fish man looked over at us . ' Well , thank you . Thank you very much . ' ' Beats that horse piss Schlitz is bottling . ' Betty grinned . The fish man was embarrassed and he started to say sonicthing , maybe about Schlitz , then he just watched her filling the mug ; when he tasted it , he said : Well , by golly , it does have something to it , does n't it ? ' He and Betty talked about beer . ' I 've never spent the night with anyone but Terry . ' ' Same old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ; piss ; brush your teeth . ' ' Have a cigarette , lover . '  |p25Hell  no . Every time I want one I 'm going to hold my breath for sixty seconds and think of the Marlboro man and the Winston assholesand all the rest of them , and that 'll do it . ' All right , I wo n't till you do . But you wo n't be able to stand Edith . I quit once for three days and Terry smelled like an ash tray . ' Not all over . It was a good scene , though , in Boston . Hotel , took her to the airport in the morning , sad loving Bloody Marys . Then up in the air . Gone . Me watching the plane . Thinking of her looking down . Gone . Back to France . Maybe I 'll go see her someday . ' You love her , huh ? ' I was fucking her , was n't I ? ' ' I guess it was tough breaking it off , her right down in Boston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I broke it off ? Why would I do a stupid thing like that ? ' Well , when the shit hit the fan Edith said you broke it off . ' Course she said that . It 's what I told her . ' Have a beer , you sly son of a bitch . ' I held up two fingers to Betty and she slid off the stool . Wait , ' the fish man said . I 'll get this one for the boys , and  --  lemmee see  --  ' he pulled out a pocket watch from his khakis , peered down in the red-lighted dark  --  yeah , Betty , I 'll have one more , then I 'll be getting home and put my fish in the oven . ' Hank cocked his head and watched him . Do n't get it started , the wife 'll come home and start looking around , wanting to know where 's the dinner . ' ' I do n't blame her , ' Betty said . ' Oh sure . She works all day too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinner on . ' She gave us the beer and we raised our mugs to him and said thanks . He raised his , smiled , nodded , sipped . He picked up his fish , turning it in his hands , then lowered it to the bar . ' If I 'm going to fry it I can start later , but when I 'm baking like with this one , I need a little more time . ' He looked through the door at two men going into the dining room . Someday I 'm going to come in here and get me one of those fish platters . I 'll be about ready for one , one of these days . ' Hank was watching him . ' Did you ever want to leave with her ? ' I said . ' Why ? ' ' You said you loved her . ' ' I still do . You 're nineteenth century , Jack . '  |p26That  's what you keep telling me . ' It 's why you 've been faithful so long . Your conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , so you end up worse : monogamous . ' What 's this made for whores shit . ' The way it used to be . Man had his wife and kids . That was one life . And he had his whore . He knew which was which , see ; he did n't get them confused . But now it 's not that way : a man has a wife and a girlfriend and they get blurred , you see , he does n't know where his emotional deposits are supposed to be . He 's in love , for Christ sake . It 's incongruous . He ca n't live with it , it 's against everything he 's supposed to feel , so naturally he takes some sort of action to get himself back to where he believes he 's supposed to be . Devotedto one woman or some such shit . He does something stupid : either he breaks with the girl and tries to love only his wife , or he leaves the wife and marries the girl . It he does that , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he 'll just have to keep marrying  --  ' Or stay monogamous . ' Aye . Both of which are utter bullshit . ' And you think that 's me . ' I think so . You 're a good enough man not to fuck without feeling love , but it you 're lucky enough for that to happen , then you feel confused and guilty because you think it means you do n't love Terry . ' I looked him in the eyes and said : Have you been talking to my mistress ? ' Mistress pisstress . I 've been talking to you for three years . I 've been watching you watching women . ' I believed him . If he knew about Edith and me , it was because he 'd guessed : they had not been talking . Am I right ? ' he said . I worry about Terry , that 's true . Just getting caught , I mean . I worry about love affairs too : the commitment , you know . ' What 's commitment got to do with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joy back in fucking . It 's got to be with a good woman , though . See , Jeanne knew . She knew I 'd never leave Sharon and Edith . Commitment . That 's with Terry . It does n't even matter if you love Terry . You 're married . What matters is not to hate each other , and to keep peace . The old Munich of marriage . You live with a wife , around a wife , not through her . She does n't run with you and conic drink beer with you , for Christ sake . Love , shit.  |p27Love  the kids . Love the horny wives and the girls in short skirts . Love everyone , my son , and keep peace with your wife . Who , by the way , is not invulnerable to love either . What 'll you do if that happens ? ' That 's her business . ' All right . I believe you . ' You should ; it 's true . ' So why are you so uptight ? ' I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' I did n't like that look of awe in your face . When I said I spent the night with Jeanne , and never broke up with her . I love you , man . You should n't feel awe for anything I do . I do n't have more guts than you . I just respond more , that 's all . I do n't like seeing you cramped . Chicks like you , I see it , Jack . Hell , Edith gets juiced up every time you call the house . Other day Sharon said she wanted a jack-in-the-box , I thought Edith would fall off the couch laughing . Wicked laugh . Lying there laughing . ' Jack-in-the-box , ' I said , smiling , shaking my head . He slapped my shoulder and we drained our mugs and left . Take care , ' I said , passing the fish man . See you boys . ' He raised his mug . Going out the door Hank turned left , toward the dining room ; I waited while he talked to the hostess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her four dollars and waved off the change . What was that about ? ' We walked to the front door and I started to go outside , but turned instead and went into the fish market . I bought him a fish platter . ' I went to the lobster tank , and an old man in a long white apron came from behind the fish counter . He 'll be gone before it 's ready , ' I said . Told her to give him a beer too . He wo n't waste a beer . By the time he 's done , there it 'll be . ' All right : cool . ' I turned to the old man . How much are you getting for lobsters ? ' ' As much as we can , ' winking , laughing , then a wheeze and a cough . The chicken lobsters were a dollar seventy-nine a pound ; she loved to eat , she 'd say 7  --  nmmi , sucking the claws , splitting open the tail . I asked for two and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't ; it was like when they call you in to pay for your crime : your father , your boss , the old humiliation of chilled ass andp28quickened heart . They were four dollars and fifty-two cents . I did not think about the bank balance until I bought the wine . On the way to Hank 's I stopped at the liquor store and bought Pinot Chardonnay , Paul Masson : two-fifty . Seven dollars . Two on beer . Nine . I went next door into the A &P; Hank was waiting in the car , listening to the Red Sox in a twi-nighter . Eight at the service station : seventeen . I bought half pints of strawberry , chocolate , and vanilla ice cream , a bunch of bananas , a can of chocolate syrup , a jar of cherries , a pressurized can of whipped cream , but no nuts , there were only cocktail nuts , salted things . My children did n't know what a banana split was ; I had told them the other day how the boys and I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend seven on Terry and me then certainly they deserved  --  was love no more than guilt ? I have a girl so Terry should have a lover . We get lobster and Pinot Chardonnay so the kids should have this junk . The banana splits cost four dollars and twenty-eight cents . A twenty-onedollarday , only two on something I wanted : the beer with Hank . Now I could slide back the door in my mind , look at the bank balancewritten there : forty-three dollars and eighty cents . I had glanced at it yesterday , I had n't really wanted to see , but it sprang like a snake and got in my head and stayed there . Eight days before payday and a week 's groceries still to buy . What now ? Stop drinking ? Stop smoking ? So we could sit stiff and tight-faced night after night , chewing blades of grass , watching the food and milk and gas all going down down down . We had tried that once , for six weeks : nothing but red wine , a dollar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bourbon and gin and beer money never turned up ; it jumped into the cash register at the supermarket , the service stations , it went to the utilities and telephone gangs , the landlord , it paid for repairs on a bad car , it went to people who sold bad shoes to children and to people who sold worse toys . It just kept going , and days before payday it was gone ; when the last milk carton was empty , Terry put powdered milk in it and did n't fool the kids , and every day there was more space in the refrigerator and cupboard , and each day I woke wanting payday to come and hating the trap I was in : afraid of death and therefore resisting the passage of time , yet now having to wish for it . I spent twenty-one bucks today . What 's the score ? ' Sox , 2-I . Top of the third . You broke ? ' There were driving lanes in the big parking lot , but people drovep29through the parking spaces too ; they drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other geometric figures , and I had to look in all directions at once . Not for a couple of days . ' Here . ' He took out his wallet . ' No , man . That 's not why I said that . ' Jesus , I know that . How much you need ? ' ' I ca n't . ' Come on . Some day you 'll come through for me . ' ' I need about forty bucks , man . I 'll go to the bank . ' He was holding out two twenties and Reggie Smith was catching a fly ball on the warning path . Edith got a check from Winnetka . ' ' It wo n't last for shit if you support me too . ' Thinking of the importedbeer , the baby-sitter . ' We needed two hundred , so she asked for three and her mother sent five . ' Five ? No shit : you mean there are people in the world who can write a check for five hundred dollars and not break into tears ? I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Sure . Buy me a bottle some time . Buy me one round of beer some time , you cheap cocksucker . ' At his house he said to come in for a quick one . I was worried about the ice cream but he reached back and took it from the bag , so I followed him in . She was at the stove . She smiled at us over her shoulder ; she had changed her shorts and shirt and had a red ribbon in her black hair . She looked as if she 'd changed souls . She stirred a pot of something and looked in the oven while Hank put up the ice cream and opened two ales and a beer . Then she sat at the table and asked Hank for a cigarette . ' I quit . ' ' Good luck , baby . ' I gave her one of mine , and took one too . ' Oh , a Lucky , ' she said . ' See what you did . As long as he was with me he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You looked like a girl from the forties just then , ' I said . ' Or early fifties . Taking the tobacco off your tongue . Except their fingernails Were painted . You 'd sec that red fingernail moving down their tongues , and I used to love watching them . '  |p30Why  ? ' Hank said . I do n't know . I think it was watching a woman being sensual . You were a little hard on that fish man . ' I know . Did n't seem so funny once I got in the car . ' What fish man ? ' I watched her listen to the story and I thought how she did n't know Hank and Jeanne had n't ended till she went back to France . And whether he guessed or not he could never know what she was like out there on the blanket . Now she was just an attentive young wife , listening to her husband , her eyes going from him to Sharon with her coloring book on the floor . Still they had a marriage . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got that money for them . Her dinner smelled good , and her house was clean . I felt it was my house too , and I remembered what I was like before I loved her , during that long time when I was n't in love ; I need to be in love , I know it is called romantic , it is n't what they call realistic , I am supposedto settle into the steady seasons , the ticking Baby Bens , of marriage . Hank , that was cruel . ' I know . But he had no balls . Cooking , for Christ sake . ' At my back door I smelled spaghetti sauce . She was ironing in the kitchen and I looked past her at the black iron skillet of sauce on the stove . I did n't give her a chance to ask me how the day had been ; I saw the question in her face as she looked up from ironing and reached for her drink at the end of the ironing board . Edith had not been drinking when Hank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank before their husbands came home . This guy gave me some lobsters , ' I said , as the screen door shut behind me . I saved his daughter from drowning and he gave me all he had . ' Oh let me see . ' She hurried around the ironing board and took the bag and looked in . I put the wine in the freezer compartment . Wine too ? ' Sure . And some stuff for the kids . ' I gave her the supermarket bag . Oh look , ' peering in , taking out the jar of cherries , the whipped cream , the chocolate syrup . What a nice daddy . ' She took the ironed clothes on hangers upstairs , then put the ironing hoard and basket of waiting clothes in the wash room . I gotp31the ball game on the radio and sat at the kitchen table with the BostonGlobe while she looked for her big pot and found it and put it on the stove . I skimmed the news stories I could n't believe while I told her Hank had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had had a good run , drunk some beer , and he had loaned me forty dollars . She was happy about the money , but she said very seriously we must be sure to pay him back , ten dollars a payday till it was done . All this time I was following the ball game and getting through the news about Nixon and the war , getting to those stories I could believe : a man winning a tobacco spitting contest ; a woman and her son drowning , taken into the sea by waves on the coast of Maine ; the baseball news . I could also believe all stories about evil . I was accustomed to lies from the government and the press , and I never believed them when they spoke with hope or comfort . So I believed all stories of lies , atrocity , and corruption , for they seemed to be the truth that I was rarely told and that I was waiting for . I knew that my vision was as distorted as the vision of those who lied , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , I started to tell Terry about the fish man , but with the first word already shaping my lips , I stopped . In a marriage there are all sorts of lies whose malignancy slowly kills everything , and that day I was running the gamut from the outright lie of adultery to the careful selectivity which comes when there are things that two people can no longer talk about . It is hard to say which kills faster but I would guess selectivity , because it is a surrender : you avoid touching wounds and therefore avoid touching the heart . If I told her the story , she would see it as a deviousway of getting at her : the man 's cooking would be the part of Inc she smothered ; Hank 's buying the seafood platter would be my rebellion . And she would be right . So I treated our disease with aspirins , I weaved my conversation around us , and all the time I knew with a taste of despair that I was stuck forever with this easy , I ying pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually into it , as into death , and that now at the end of those years and the beginning of all the years to come I had lost all dedication to honesty between us . Yet sometimes when I was alone and away from the house , always for this to happen I had to be away from the house , driving perhaps on a day of sunlight and green trees and rolling mea ( 1ows , I would hear a song from another time and I could weepbut did not ) for the tints when I loved her every day and came up the walk itt the afternoons happy to sec her , days when I never hadp32to think before I spoke . As we ate lobsters and drank wine we listened to the ball game . And later , after the spaghetti dinner that was n't eaten , we made love . We had watched the children , who were impatient for banana splits and so ate only a little and that quickly , sucking spaghetti , spearing meatballs , their eyes returning again and again to the door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the can of chocolate syrup . They were like men late for work eyeing the clock behind a lunch counter . They loved the banana splits , ate till I feared for their stomachs , then I went with a book to the living room couch , and Terry put the meatballs and spaghetti sauce in the refrigerator to be warmed again another day . When she got into bed I pretended to be asleep but she touched my chest and spoke my name until I looked at her . I went a little crazy last night , ' she said . I 'm sorry . ' Okay . ' I should n't have got drunk . ' She found my hand and held it . Forget it , ' I said . I 've got to grow up . ' Who ever told you grown-ups were n't violent ? ' Not with their husbands . ' Read the papers . Women murder their husbands . ' Not people like us . ' Sailors ' wives , is that it ? Construction workers ? ' I do n't mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to kill each other . You can have separate lives then , when things go bad . You do n't have to sweat over your beer in the same hot kitchen : watching her fat ass under wilted blue cotton , her dripping face and damp straight hair . Pretty soon somebody picks up a hammer and goes to it . Did Hank make a pass ? ' Yes . ' He did ? ' I said yes . ' Well ? ' Well what . ' What did he do ? ' None of your business . ' All right , then : what did you do ? ' Nothing . '  |p33Come  on . ' He tried to kiss me on the porch , so I went inside . ' Where ? ' Grinning at her . Here ? ' To the kitchen . To get a beer . ' And he followed you in and  --  ' Said he loved me and kissed me and said he did n't love Edith . Then I felt dirty and we went outside and sat on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edith ? ' Yes . She 's a sweet girl and she does n't deserve that , and I do n't want any part of it . ' But until he said that , you felt all right . ' We can stop this now . Or do you want to know whether his nose was to the left or right of mine ? ' Do you remember ? ' We were lying on the floor and he was on my right , so I 'd say his nose was to the left of mine . ' Lying on the floor , huh ? Goodness . ' I 'd squatted down to get a beer from  --  Oh shut up . ' I was only teasing . ' You were doing more than that . You 're glad he kissed me . ' Let 's say I 'm not disturbed . ' Well I am . ' She got out of bed for a cigarette and when she came back I pretended to be asleep and listened to her smoking deeply beside me . Then she put out the cigarette and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I mounted her , thrusting the sound of bedspringsinto the still summer night , not a word between us , only breath and the other sound : and I remembered newly married one morning she was holding a can of frozen orange juice over a pitcher and the sound of its slow descent out of the can drove us back to bed . I could feel her getting close but I still was far away , and I opened my eyes : hers were closed . I shut rnine and saw Edith thisafternoon oh love ; then I thought she is thinking of Hank , behind those closed eyes her skull is an adulterous room , and now he washere too and he had given me the forty dollars and it was Hank , not I , I-lank who was juggling us all , who would save us , and now we came , Hank and Terry and Edith and me , and I said , Goodnight , love , ' and rolled over and slept.  |p34On  a moonlit summer night , in a cemeterysix blocks from my house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of a pedestaled eight-foot bronze angel , Hank made love to my red-haired wife . At midnight I had left them on the front porch . Edith had the flu , and Hank had come over late for a nightcap ; it was the day after payday and I gave him ten dollars which he did n't want to take . We drank on the front porch , but I was tired and I watched them talking about books and movies , then I went to bed , their voices coming like an electric train around the corner of the house , through the screen of my open window . I slept . When I woke my heart was fast before I knew what it knew . I lay in silence louder than their voices had been , and listened for the creak of floor under a step , the click of her Zippo , a whisper before it died in the air . But there was only silence touching my flesh , so they were n't in the house ; unless making love in the den or living room they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were locked in sculpted love waiting for me to go back to sleep . Or perhaps they were in the yard and if I went outside I would turn a corner of the house and smack into the sight of her splayed white legs under the moon and the white circle of his wedging ass . The clock 's luminous dial was too moonlit to work : with taut stealth I moved across the bed , onto Terry 's side , and took the clock from the bedside table : two-twenty . I waited another ten minutes , each pale gray moonlit moment edged with expectancy , until I was certain it was emptiness I heard , not their silence . And if indeed they were listening , I would cast the burden of cunning on them : I rolled over and dropped my feet thumping to the floor , and walked to the bathroom next to my room and turned on the light . I flushed the toilet , then went out through the other door , into the kitchen , the dining room , the living room , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I shivered , standing in my T-shirt so white if they were watching . His car was parked in front . Their glasses were on the steps . I picked them up : lime and gin-smelling water . Then I went to bed and waited , and I saw them under the willow tree in the backyard , the branches hanging almost to the grass , and I asked myself and yes , I said , I want the horns ; plant them , Hank , plant them . I wanted lovely Edith now there with me and twice I picked up the phone and once dialed three numbers , but she would be asleep with her fever and there was nothing really to tell yet , Ip35did n't really know yet , and after that I lay in bed , quick-hearted and alert , and waited and smoked . At ten minutes after three he started his car . I ran tiptoeing to the living room window as his car slowly left the curb and Terry stood on the sidewalk , smoking ; she lifted a hand , waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior light , but I could n't see him , then his car was dark , just tail lights again , and then he was gone and the street was quiet . She stood smoking . When she flicked the cigarette in the street and started up the walk , I ran back to the bedroom . She came in and crossed the living room , into the dining room and bathroom . She stayed there a while : water ran , the toilet flushed , water ran again . Then in the kitchen she popped open a beer and went to the living room ; her lighter clicked , scraped , clicked shut . When she finished the beer she plunked it down on the coffee table and came into the bedroom . Where 've you been ? ' She got out of her clothes and dropped them on the floor , and lies cracked her voice : ' I woke up and could n't get back to sleep so I went out for a walk . ' She went naked to the living room and came back shaking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Terry . ' ' What . ' ' You do n't have to tell me that . I woke up at two-twenty . ' She drew on her cigarette . Still she had not looked at me . ' You bastard . Did you ever go to sleep ? ' ' Yes . ' ' I wish I could believe that . ' ' I was tired . ' ' You could 've brought me to bed . ' ' You could 've come with me . ' She threw back the sheet and blanket and got out of bed and went fast , pale skin and flopping hair , out of the room . She came back with a beer and got into bed and covered up and bent the pillow under her head so she could drink . I 'm lonely , that 's why . I 'm a woman , I 'm sorry , I ca n't be anything else , and 1 need to be told that and I need to be made love to , you do n't make love with me anymore , you fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he held my hand and listened to me talk about this shitty marriage because all you ever see is the house , you do n't see me and he said let 's go see the bronze angel , we 've never seen itp36in the dark , and I was happy when he said that and I was happy making love  --  ' So she had really done it , and I lay there feeling her wash down me , from my throat , down my chest , my legs , then gone like surf from the sea , cold like the sea.  --  and I lay afterward looking up at her wings and for the first time since leaving the porch I thought of you and for a moment under her wings I hated you for bringing me to this . Then that went away . I wanted to go home and seal up the split between us , like gluing this shitty old furniture , I wanted to clap my hands for Tinker Bell , do something profound and magic that would bring us back the way we used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and when I never would have made love with someone else . And all the way walking home I wanted to hurry and be with you , here in this bed in this house with my husband and children where I belong . And right now I love you I think more than I have for years but I 'm angry , Jack , way down in my blood I 'm angry because you set this up in all kinds of ways , you wanted it to happen and now it has and now I do n't know what else will happen , because it 's not ended , making love is never ended  --  ' Are you seeing him again ? ' No . ' Then it 's ended . ' Do you think making love is like smoking , for Christ sake ? That if you quit it 's over ? It 's not just the act . What 's wrong with you  --  it 's feeling , it 's  --  ' She drank , then sat up and drank again , head back for a long swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smoking . It 's what , ' I said . Promises . ' You promised to see him again ? ' I did n't say anything . Opening my legs is a promise . ' But he must have said something . ' I wish you could hear your voice right now , the way it was just then , I wish I had it taped and I 'd play it for you till you went to a shrink to find out why your voice just now was so Goddamn oily . You like this . You like it . Well hear : it took us a long time to get to the cemetery because we kept stopping to kiss and when we did walk it was slow because we had our arms around each other and his hand was on my tit all the dine and when we got to the angel we did n't loot , at her , not once , we undressed and got down on thep37ground and we fucked , Jack , we fucked like mad , and I was so hot I came before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was long and slow and I told him I loved him and you , you poor man , you sick cuckold , look at your face  --  Jesus Christ , what am I married to ? ' Will you stop ? ' Why should I ? You ought to be knocking my teeth out now . But not you . You want to watch us . Is that it ? Is that what you want , Jack ? ' I sat up and was swinging at her but stopped even before she saw it coming , and my hand opened and I pointed at her eyes , the finger close , so close , and I wanted to gouge with it , to hit , to strangle , the finger quivering now as I tried not to shout beneath the children 's rooms , my voice hoarse and constricted in my throat : Terry , you fuck who you want and when you want and where you want but do not do not give me any of your half-ass insights into the soul of a man you 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh at first or at least a smile , but she lay with her head back on the pillow , throat arched , her shoulders and breasts shaking , and prolonged it , forced it cracking into the air , withering my tense arm , and I got out of bed so I would not even touch the sheet she lay on . Oh God : half-ass insights into the  --  what ? The soul of a man I 've never understood ? Oh my . You poor baby , and it 's so simple . You think you 're a swinger , free love , I can fuck whoever I want , oh my how you talk and talk and talk and it all comes down to that one little flaw you wo n't admit : you 're a pervert , Jack . You need help . And I 'm sorry , I really am , but there 's nothing I can do about it . I made love with Hank tonight and he wants to see me tomorrow  --  or this afternoon really  --  and when I finish this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be up soon and you 're not known for gettingthem breakfast  --  ' ' I ' 11 do it . Forget it , I 'll do it . ' Fine . Do that . That 's one thing you can do . You ca n't help me with my other problem any more than I can help you with yours . See , I 'm a big girl now and I knew what I was doing tonight and I do n't know if I can very well say tomorrow  --  today  --  well gee I lank that was last night but this is now and gee I just do n't want to aiivinorc . I mean even you with all your progressive and liberal rheas vw ill have to admit that even adult cry has its morality , that one can cup out on that too . So I have things to figure out . '  |p38Yes  . ' I started leaving the room . Do what you can . ' Oh , that 's good . ' I stopped at the door but did n't look back . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice : Just do what you can . Well , I will , Jack , I will . ' I went to the kitchen and drank an ale and when Terry was asleep I went to bed . Next morning I woke first , alert and excited , though I had slept only four hours . Everything was quiet except birds . I got up and dressed , watching Terry asleep on her back , mouth open ; I stepped over her clothes on the floor , and going through the living room picked up her beer can and brought it to the kitchen . In the silence I could feel the children sleeping upstairs , as if their breathing caressedme . I went outside : the morning was sun and blue and cool air . I drove to a small grocery store and bought a Globe and cigarettes . Then I drove to a service station with a pay phone and parked but did n't get out of the car . It was only five minutes of nine on a Sunday morning , and they would be asleep . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I drove to their street : all the houses looked quiet , theirs did too , and I went past , then turned around in a driveway and started back , believing I would go on by ; then I stopped and walked up their driveway to the back door and there she was in the dim kitchen away from the sun , surprised , turning to me in her short nightgown , a happy smile as she came to the door and pushed it gently so the latch was quiet . I stepped in and she was holding me tight , and I stroked her soft brushed hair and breathed her toothpaste and soap . Are you all right now ? ' The fever 's gone . Was it fun last night ? ' They made love . ' She moved her head back to look at me and say , Really ? ' ; then she was at my cheek again . She told you ? ' She did n't want to , but I knew , I had waked up . They went to the bronze angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was holding me , rubbing her cheek on my chest . Her kitchen was clean . They might see each other today . If they do , we can get together . ' We 'll have the kids and they 'll have the cars . ' Shit . '  |p39Water  started boiling ; she let me go and turned off the fire . Then she was back . How are you ? ' I said . Still weak , that 's all . I told you the fever 's gone . ' ' I mean about them . ' Fine . I think it 's fine . He 'll be asleep for a long time . ' ' He might wake up . ' We 'd hear him , we 'd be right under the bedroom . He always goes to the bathroom first . ' Sharon , ' I said . She 'll sleep too . ' We started for the door ; she stopped and put instant coffee in two cups and poured water . Then we crept through the house to the guest room . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , Sharon was coming downstairs . Before getting into the car I squinted up at the bedroom where Hank slept . At home I did n't go in ; I sat on the back steps to read the sports page . I could smell Terry 's cigarette , then I heard her moving and she came outside in her robe , hair uncombed , and sat beside me and put a hand on my shoulder . I nearly flinched . ' I was scared , ' she said . When I woke up and you were n't there . I thought you had left . ' ' I did . To get cigarettes and a paper . ' What took so long ? ' Driving around looking at the bright new morning . ' ' Is it ? ' I looked up from the paper and waved a hand at the trees and rooftops and sky . Blink your eyes and look at it . ' Your beard 's beautiful in the sun . It has some blond and red in it . ' ' I got that from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me . ' Why should I ? ' ' What I said . ' ' ' hhat 's night talk . ' ' I know it . Just as long as you know it . I was being defensive because I was scared and when I 'm scared I get vicious . ' ' Why Were Vou scared ? '  |p40Because  I have a lover . ' Is that what you 've decided ? ' I have n't decided anything . I made love with Hank so I have alover , no matter what I do about it . You really do n't care ? ' She had the right word : care . So I must get her away from that . The way to hunt a deer is not to let him know you 're alive . I care about you . It 's monogamy I do n't care about . ' You 've said that for years . I 've waked up with that whispering to me for years . But a long time ago you were n't that way . ' A long time ago I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you do what I 'm doing . ' Are you doing anything ? ' I do n't know yet . ' But you want to . ' If I knew that I 'd know something . ' Why do n't you know it ? I know it . ' How ? ' Her hand was still on my arm ; I was scanning box scores . You stayed out there with him because you wanted to and I think you came home planning to see him today and tomorrow and tomorrowand tomorrow , but when you found out I knew about it then it got too sticky . Just too bloody sticky . To all in one night leave monogamy and then have to carry it out with your husband knowing about it , staying with the kids while you  --  ' Oh stop , ' her voice pleading , her fingers tightening on my shoulder . Shhh , stop . ' Is n't that so ? ' I do n't know . I mean , sure I wanted to , and I like Hank very much ; in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing 's changed that , what 's with Hank is  --  ' she squeezed my shoulder again and looking at the paper I heard the fake smile in her voice  --  it 's friendly lust , that 's all . But it might not be marriage , living like this . ' We 're married . You and I are married . So it has to be marriage . ' It might not be for long . ' I wish Boston were a National League town . You mean you 're afraid you 'll run off with him ? ' No . My God no . There are all sorts of ways for a marriage not to be a marriage . ' You 're just afraid because it 's new . ' If I kept on with Hank you 'd want a girl . You 'd feel justified then . Maybe even with Edith , and would n't that he a horror . '  |p41Seems  strange to me that while you 're deciding whether or not to make love with a man you call your lover , you 're thinking most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange . You 're my husband . ' It is strange , and it 's beneath you . This is between you and Hank , not me . ' She took a pack of cigarettes from the carton I 'd bought and sat smoking while I read . Are you hungry ? ' she said . Yes . ' Pancakes and eggs ? ' Buckwheat . Are the kids up ? ' No . I think I 'll take them to the beach today . Do you want to go ? ' I want to watch the game . ' I think I 'll tell him no . ' Is that what you want ? ' I do n't know . I 'm just scared . ' Because I know about it ? ' Because there 's something to know . ' She went inside . I read the batting averages and pitching records , then the rest of the paper , listening to her washing last night 's pots and dishes . Then she started cooking bacon and I sat waiting , smellingand listening to the bacon , until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , then Terry lit a cigarette and said , Well , ' and went to the bedroom and shut both doors . I could hear her voice , but that was all . Natasha and Sean were upstairs gettingdressed ; when Terry came back to the kitchen she went to the foot of the stairs and called them and said to put on bathing suits . We 're going to the beach ! ' The beach ! ' they said . The beach ! ' How did you get it done ? ' I said . He answered . He 'd said he would . I asked how Edith was and he told me . ' That was the signal ? ' Yes . ' Poor Hank . And what if you had decided to see him ? ' I would n't have called . ' She had been smoking a lot all morning . Now she started making a Bloody Mary . ' Do you want one ? "  |p42No  . How 's Edith ? ' All right . Her fever 's gone . ' For some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife . ' When I read or hear husband I see a grimly sereneman in a station wagon ; he is driving his loud family on a Sundayafternoon . They will end with ice cream , sticky car seats , weariness , and ill tempers . In his youth he had the virtues of madness : rage and passion and generosity . Now he gets a damp sponge from the kitchen and wipes dried ice cream from his seat covers . He longs for the company of loud and ribald men , he would like to drink bourbon and fight in a bar , steal a pretty young girl and love her through the night . When someone says wife I see the confident , possessive , and amused face of a woman in her kitchen ; among bright curtains and walls and the smell of hot grease she offers her husband a kiss as he returns from the day sober , paunchy , on his wav to some nebulous goal that began as love , changed through marriage to affluence , is now changing to respectable survival . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his balls hang like a trophy taken in battle from a young hero long dead . I wheezed again with this allergy as I stood on the lawn and watched Terry and Natasha and Sean drive off to Plum Island . They had a picnic basket , a Styrofoam cooler of soft drinks and beer , a beach hag of cigarettes and towels , and a blanket . They left in a car that needed replacing . This morning 's lovely air was now rent apart by the sounds of power mowers . One was across the street , two blocks down to the right ; the man behind it wore a T-shirt and shorts and was bald . The one to the left was on my side of the street , behind shrubs , and I only saw him when he got to the very front of his lawn , turned , and started back . I sat on the grass and chewed a blade of it and watched the bald man . I wondered what he was thinking . Then I thought he must be thinking nothing at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine that was mowinghis lawn and go into the garage and jam the garden shears into his throat . Yet once in a while you saw them : they sat in restaurants , these old couples of twenty and twenty-five and thirty years , and looked at each other with affection , and above all they talked . They were always a wonder to see , and when I saw them I tried to hear what they said . Usually it was pleasant small talk : aging sailors speakingp43in signals and a language they have understood forever . If I looked at most couples with scorn and despair , I watched these others as mystified as if I had come across a happy tiger in a zoo ; and I watched them with envy . It can be faked , Hank said once . We were in a bar . The afternoon bartender had just finished work for the day , his wife was waiting for him in a booth , and they had two drinks and talked ; once they laughed aloud . There are two kinds ofpeople , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unhappy ones who do n't . Now I went inside and upstairs and turned on the ball game . Hank 's marriage was n't a grave because Hank was n't dead ; he used his marriage as a center and he moved out from it on azimuths of madness and when he was tired he came back . While Edith held to the center she had been hurt , and for a few days when she started guessing that Hank was not faithful I did n't like being with them : you could smell the poison on their breaths , feel the tiny arrows flyingbetween them . Now she had a separate life too and she came home and they sat in the kitchen with their secrets that were keepingthem alive , and they were friendly and teasing again . It was as simple as that and all it required was to rid both people of jealousy and of the conviction that being friendly parents and being lovers were the same . Hank and Edith knew it , and I knew it . I had waked happy , believing Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was at the beach with the children , and we were husband and wife again . I sat watching the game . Far off , as though from the streets behind the black and white ball park , I could hear the power mowers . After dinner Terry came to the living room where I was reading on the couch . Upstairs the children were watching television . Hank came to the beach . ' He found you ? On a hot Sunday at Plum Island ? My God , the man 's in love . ' He says he is . ' Really ? ' Oh , I know it 's just talk , it 's just a line  --  he wants to see me tonight . ' She was smoking . I wish I had n't last night . But I did and it does n't seem really right to say yes and then next morning say no , I mean it 's not like I was drunk or something , I knew what I was doing . But I 'm scared , Jack . ' She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she tool : nn  --  hand . ' Look at ntc . What do you reallyp44think ? Or really feel . You 're not scared of this ? People screwing other people ? ' No , I 'm not scared ! Then why am I ? When I 'm the one who  --  Jesus . ' What did you feel at the beach ? ' Guilty . Watching my children and talking to him . ' Did you tell him you 'd meet him ? ' She lowered her eyes and said , Yes . ' And now you do n't feel like it because it 's embarrassing to leave the house when I know where you 're going . If I did n't know , you 'd have got out with some excuse . Does Hank know that I know ? ' I did n't tell him . It just seemed too much , when we 're all together . Wo n't you feel strange ? When you see him tomorrow ? ' I do n't think so . What are you going to do tonight ? ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen . I listened to her washing the dishes : she worked very slowly , the sounds of rui. iing water and the dull clatterof plate against plate as she put them in the drainer coming fartherand farther apart so that I guessed ( and rightly ) she had done less than half the dishes when I heard her quickly cross the floor and go into the bathroom . She showered fast , she must have been late , then she opened the bathroom door to let the steam out . Late or not , of course she spent a long while now with the tubes and brushes and small bottles of her beauty , which was natural anyway and good , but when people came over or we went out she worked on it . I had always resented that : if a car pulled up in front of the house she fled to the bathroom and gave whoever it was a prettier face than she gave me . But I thought , too , that she gave it to herself . She closed the bathroom closet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out briskly into the bedroom ; lying propped on the couch , I looked over the Tolstoy book ; she had a towel around her , and I watched her circling the bed , to our closet . She was careful not to look at me . On the way to the mirror she would have to face me or turn her head ; so I raised the book and read while she pushed aside hangered dresses , paused , then chose something . I felt her glance as she crossed the room to the full-length mirror . I tried to read , listening to the snapping of the brassiere , the dress slipping over her head and down her body , and the brush strokes on her hair . Then I raised my eyes as she stepped into the living room wearing her yellow dress and small shiny yellow shoes , her hair long and soft , and behind the yellow at her shoulders it was lovely . When I looked at herp45she opened her purse and dropped in a fresh pack of cigarettes , watching it fall . She had drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All right . ' ' I 'll do the dishes when I get back . ' No sweat . ' She looked at me , her eyes bright with ambivalence : love or affectionor perhaps only nostalgia and , cutting through that tenderness , an edge of hatred . Maybe she too knew the marriage was foreverchanged and she blamed me ; or maybe it was n't the marriage at all but herself she worried about , and she was going out now into the night , loosed from her moorings , and she saw me as the man with the axe who had cut her adrift onto the moonless bay . My face was hot . She turned abruptly and went upstairs and I listened to her voice with the children . She lingered . Then she came downstairs and called to me from the kitchen : The movie should be over around eleven . ' I read again . I could have been reading words in Latin . Then the screen opened and she was back in the kitchen , my heart dropping a long way ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys jingled as she swept them from the dresser , and my heart rose and she was gone . After a while I was able to read and I turned back the pages I had read without reading ; I read for twenty minutes until I was sure Hank was gone too , then I went to the bedroom and phoned Edith . " Ivan Ilyitch 's life was most simple and most ordinary and thereforemost terrible . " ' Who said that ? ' She was n't literary but that did n't matter ; I loved her for that too and anyway I did n't know what did matter with a woman except to find one who was clean and peaceful and affectionate and then love her . Tolstoy . Our lives are n't so simple and ordinary . ' Is she gone too ? ' A movie . That 's what she tells me so the kids can hear repeated what she told them . A new twist to the old lying collusion of husband and wife against their children . But she also told me the truth . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they relax him and help him write next day . I hate Westerns . ' I love them . There 's one on the tube tonight and I 'll watch it with the kids . ' ' We 'll have to do something about these cars . '  |p46Maybe  a car pool of sorts . ' Dear Mother , please buy me a car so I can see my lover while Hank sees his . ' Is she really that rich ? ' She 's that rich . I miss you . ' Tomorrow . Eleven ? ' ' I ' 11 go shopping . ' ' I ' 11 go to the library . ' You use that too much . Some day she 'll walk over and see if you 're there . ' She 's too lazy . Anyway , if things keep on like this maybe I can stop making excuses . ' Do n't count on it . ' Being a cuckold 's all right , but it 's boring . Get a sitter and take a taxi . ' Go watch the movie with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ; they were on the lavatoryand the toilet tank , and I replaced tops on bottles and put all of it into the cabinet . I went to the foot of the stairs and called . What ! ' When their voices were raised they sounded alike ; I decidedit was Sean . Turn to Channel Seven ! ' What 's on ! ' Cowboys , man ! Tough hombre cowboys ! ' Cowboys ! Can we watch it ! ' Right ! ' All of it ! ' Yeah ! All of it ! ' Arc you gon na watch it ! ' I am ! I 'll be up in a while ! ' I got a pot out of the dishwater and washed it for popcorn . Once Sean called down that it had started and I said I knew , I knew , I could hear the horses ' hooves and I 'd be up evermore ricky-tick . There were Cokes hidden in the cupboard so the kids would n't drink them all in one day . I poured them over ice and opened a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought everything up on a tray . Hey neat-o , ' Natasha said . Popcorn ! ' I pulled the coffee table in front of the couch and put the tray on it.  |p47Sit  between us , ' Natasha said . Sean hugged me when I sat down . We got a good Daddy . ' Now Mom 's watching a movie and we 're watching a movie , ' Natasha said . What movie did Momma go to ? ' I believe a Western . ' You did n't want to go ? ' Nope . I wanted to see this one . He 's going to hit that guy soon . ' Which guy ? ' The fat mean one . ' How do you know ? ' Because if he does n't hit him we wo n't be happy . ' When the movie was over , I tucked them in and kissed them and went downstairs to Tolstoy and the couch ; as I read I kept glancing at my watch and at midnight I thought how she never uses the seat belt , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept reading and I remembered though trying not to Leonard in Michigan : he had married young and outgrown his wife and he hated her . When he was drunk , he used to say Nobody hates his wife as much as I hate mine . And one night drinking beer  --  he was a big weight-lifting man and drank beer like no one I 've ever known  --  he said I 've thought of a way a man can kill his wife . You take her for a ride , you see , and you have a crash helmet with you and it 's just resting there on the seat between you , she wonders what it 's there for , but the dumb bitch wo n't say anything , she wo n't say anything about anything and the world can fall down and still she 'll just blink her Goddamn dumb eyes and stare and never let you know if there 's anything burning behind them , then you get out on some quiet straight country highway and put that son of a bitch on your head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bitch and floorboard into a telephone pole and throw the crash helmet way the fuck out into the fieldI wished the movie had n't ended and I was still upstairs watching it with the children ; the TV room was a good room to be in , the cleanest in the house because it was nearly bare : a couch , two canvas deck chairs , the TV , and a coffee table . A beach ball and some toy trucks and cars were on the flour . " Hie secret was not having much life in the roost . It was living that defeated " ferry : the rooms where we slept and ate and the living roots and dishes and our clothes . Thep48problem was a simple one which could be solved with money , but I would never make enough so that I could pay someone to do Terry 's work . So there was no solution . Two years ago Terry had pneumonia and was in the hospital for a week . Natasha and Sean and I did well . Everyone made his own bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we took turns with the pots ; every day I washed clothes , folded them as soon as they were dry , and put them away ; twice that week I vacuumed the house . All this took little time and I never felt harried . When Terry came home , I turned over the house to her again ' , and the children stopped making their beds and washing their dishes , though I 'd told her how good they had been . We could do that again now , and I could even have my own laundry bag and put my things in it every night , wash my clothes once a week Ind wash my own dishes and take turns with the pots , I could work in the house as though I lived with another man . But I would n't do it . If Terry had always kept house and was keeping it now , then I could help her without losing and I would do it . But not the way she was now . In Michigan when I was in graduate school , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred a month , and for a while she was excited , I 'd come home and find the furniture rearranged , and one afternoon she painted the bathroom orange . The landlord had paid for the paint , and for two buckets of yellow for the kitchen ; he was an old farmer , he lived down the dirt road from us , he liked Terry , and he told her when she finished the kitchen he 'd buy paint for the other rooms . Whatever colors she wanted . For a few days she talked about different colors , asked me what I thought the bedrooms should be , and the halls , and then a week went by and then another and one day when I was running down the road Mr. Kenfield was at his mailbox and he asked me how the painting was coming . I called over my shoulder : Fine . ' That afternoon we painted the kitchen . I was sullen because I should have been studying , and we painted in near silence , listening to the radio , while Natasha watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , now tell Kenfield you 're too busy to paint the other rooms . At least now when he comes for coffee he 'll see the yellow walls . And if he pisses he 'll see the orange ones . Now I 'm going upstairs to do my own work . ' All through graduate school that 's what she kept doing : my work . When I brought a book home she read it before I did , and when my friends came over for an afternoon beer and we talkedp49about classes and books and papers , she sounded like a graduate student . Once I daydreamed about her soul : she and Rex and I were sitting at our kitchen table drinking beer , and I watched her talking about Sons and Lovers and I remembered her only a year ago when I was a lieutenant junior-grade and she was complaining about the captain 's snotty treatment of reserve officers , deriding the supply officer 's bureaucratic handling of the simplest matters , and saying she wished there were still battleships so I could be on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the farmhouse in Michigan I daydreamed that Rex and I were ballplayers and now it was after the game and Terry had watched from behind the dugout and she was telling us she saw early in the game that I could n't get the curve over , and she did n't think I could go all the way , but in the fifth she saw it happen , she saw me get into the groove , and then she thought with the heat I 'd tire , but after we scored those four in the seventh  --  and he did n't tag him , I know he did n't  --  she knew I 'd go all the way  --  And she kept talking , this voice from behind the dugout . And from behind the dugout she came up to my den where I worked and brought a book downstairs and later when I came down at twilight , blinking from an afternoon 's reading , I 'd find her on the couch , reading . A couple of years ago in this house in Massachusetts , she put Sean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before ; I noticedit when I went up to kiss the children goodnight . That was two days after I had gone to the basement and found on the stairs a pot and a Dutch oven : the stairway was dimly lit , and at first I thought something was growing in them , some plant of dark and dampness that Terry was growing on the stairs . Then I leaned closer and saw that it had once been food ; it was covered with mold now , but in places I could see something under the mold , something we had n't finished eating . I got the tool or whatever I had gone down for , then I went to the living room ; she was sitting on the couch , leaning over the coffee table where the newspaper was spread , and without looking at her  --  for I could n't , I looked over her head  --  I said : I found those pots . ' She said : Oh . ' I turned away . I have never heard her sound so guilty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard her coming up fast , she gagged once going through the kitchen , and then she was gone , into the backyard . Soon I heard the hose . I stood in the living room watching a young couple pushing a baby in a stroller ; they were across the street , walking slowly on the sidewalk . The girl had shortp50straight brown hair ; her face was plain and she appeared , from that distance , to be heavy in the hips and flat-chested . Yet I longed for her . I imagined her to be clean ; I pictured their kitchen , clean and orderly before they left for their walk . Then Terry came in , hurrying ; from where I stood I could have seen her in the kitchen if I 'd turned , but I did n't want to ; she went through the kitchen , into the bathroom , and shut the door ; then I heard her throwing up . I stood watching the girl and her husband and child move out of my vision . After a while the toilet flushed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she went outside again . For two days we did n't mention it . Every time I looked at her  --  less and less during those two days  --  I saw the pot and Dutch oven again , as though in her soul . But when I kissed little Sean and smelled his clean child 's flesh and breath , then the other  --  last night 's urine  --  I went pounding down the stairs and found her smoking a cigarette at the kitchen table , having cleared a space for herself among the dirty dishes ; she was reading the T V Guide with a look of concentration as though she were reading poetry , and in that instant when I ran into the room and saw her face before she was afraid , before she looked up and saw the rage in mine , I knew what that concentration was : she was pushing those dishes out of her mind , as one sweeps crumbs off a table and out of sight , and I saw her entire life as that concentratedeffort not to face the dishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark down there , on the stairs . I said low , hoarse , so the childrenwould n't hear : And what else . Huh ? What else . ' She did n't know what I was talking about . She was frightened , and I knew I had about three minutes before her fright , as always , turned to rage . What else do you hide from behind TV Guides ? Huh ? Who in the hell are you ? ' What did n't I do ? ' She was still frightened , caught . She pushed back her chair , started to rise . She gestured at the dishes . ' I ' 11 do these as soon as I finish my  --  ' and we both looked at the ash tray , at the smoldering cigarette she could not have held in her fingers . It 's not what you did n't do , it 's why . I can list a dozen whats every day , but I ca n't name one reason . Why do I live in the foulest house I know . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me a shitty house . Why is it that you say you love your children but they go unbathed for days , and right now Sean is lying in last night 's piss . ' I forgot . '  |p51Goddamnit  , ' and I was nearly whispering , that 's your TV Guide again , you 're hiding , you did n't forget anymore than you forgot those pots  --  ' Will you stop talking about those pots ! ' Shhh . I have n't mentioned them since I found them . ' They 've been in your eyes ! Your Goddamn nitpicking eyes ! ' And she fled from the room . I stood listening : her steps slowed at the top of the stairs , calmly entered Sean 's room , and then she was talking , her voice sweet , motherly , loving . Sean jumped to the floor . After a while Terry came down with the dirty sheet ; she went through the kitchen without speaking , into the wash room ; I heard her taking wet clothes from the washer to the dryer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started both machines . So she had forgotten the clothes in the washer too , was behind on that too ; vet neither of those was true . She had n't forgotten , and she was n't merely behind . She was ... what ? I did n't know . For a moment I had an impulse to go through the entire house , a marauding soldier after her soul : to turn over the ironing basket and hold before her eves the shirts I had n't seen in months ; to shine a flashlight under the children 's beds , disclosing fluffs of dust , soiled pajamas , apple cores ; to lift up the couch cushions and push her face toward the dirt and beach sand , the crayons and pencils and pennies  --  over every inch of every room , into every cluttered functionless drawer ( but no : they functioned as waste baskets , storage bins for things undone ) . I wanted to do that : take her arm and pull and push her to all these failures which I saw , that night , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen as she entered it from the wash room . I went on the front porch for a cigarette in the dark . It was fall then , and for a while I was able to forget the house . The air was brisk but still , and I was warm enough in my sweat shirt ; I walked down to the end of the block and back , smelling that lovely clean air . Then I went back into the house . As soon as I stepped in , it all struck me : it was there waiting , jesting with me , allowing me the clean walk in the air , the peace , only to slap me when I walked in . I stayed in the living room with a book . After two pages I laid it aside and looked for one that would serve as well as the autumn night had ; I found one , and after two pages I was right , there was neither house nor " ferry . The book was Saturday Night and SundayMorning , and I saw niv'self in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a married woman . I thought of the sleeping childrenp52above me and was ashamed ; but I also felt the slow and persuasive undertow of delight . Then I heard her singing in the kitchen . She was washing the dishes now ; beyond her , from the closed wash room , came the rocking of the washer , the hum of the dryer . I did n't want her to sing . She sings alone in the kitchen when she 's angry , brooding . So I knew then I would n't be able to keep reading the book ; she would do something . I read faster , as though speed would force a stronger concentration , would block her out . I was able to read for nearly an hour . It took her that long to clean the kitchen ; the washer and dryer had stopped , but she had n't removed the dry clothes and put the wet ones in the dryer . So when she came into the living room , a bourbon and water in her hand , all fright and guilt gone now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me know there are times she could kill me , I looked up at her , then stood and looked scornfully not at her face but past her , and said in a low , cold voice that I would go put the clothes in the dryer . Wait . I want to talk to you . ' We stood facing each other . We can talk while the clothes are drying . ' No . Because I 'm not ready to fold the others . And do n't look at me like that , I 'll fold them , Goddamnit . ' I sat down , got out of the position of being squared off , got out of range . I 'm tired of being judged . Who do you think you are anyway ? Who are you to judge me ? I did forget Sean had wet last night . If you got them up one morning out of every thousand , if you loved them as much as you say you do  --  oh , that was shitty , accusing me of not loving my children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a catty , bitchy woman  --  lying innuendos  --  if you ever got them up you 'd know he had n't wet for four or five days before that , so I was n't used to  --  ' Three days . He 's been telling me every morning . ' All right : three . Anyway , I forgot . ' She had finished her cigarette ; she found another on the bookshelf . And I did forget those pots . I cooked in them the night you had the party . ' What night I had the party ? ' Whatever Goddamn night it was . When you were  --  ' she mocked a child 's whine  --  so depressed  --  you and your fucking self-indulgent bad moods  --  ' What night are you talking about ? '  |p53When  you called up your friends to have this impromptu Goddamnparty . ' They 're your friends too . ' Oh sure : me and the boys . They bring their wives over because they have to ; I get to talk to the wives . It 's your party , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep clean as HowardJohnson 's . ' You know my friends like you . We were discussing the pots . The famous pots on the stairs . ' You supercilious shit . ' I smiled at her . I cooked in them that night , and you were in your funky mood , and you had to call Hank and Roger and Jim and Matt , I did n't even have time to clean the Goddamn kitchen , and I put those pots on the stairs , I was going to wash them when everybody went home but they stayed half the Goddamn night  --  ' I recall you dancing . ' So I forgot them that night , I probably got drunk , I do n't know , and the next day I was n't thinking about dirty pots . I just do n't go around thinking about pots ! And I forgot them until you found them . And that 's the absolute God 's truth ! ' She went to the kitchen and came back with a fresh drink and stood looking at me . I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you 're full of shit . I can believe you forgot them that night , what with drinking and dancing . Although I do n't see why you could n't have washed them while these quote friends of mine unquote wandered in  --  other women do that , you know  --  I realize you probably had to put your face on and so forth before they came , but after they came I think you could have got someone to talk to you in the kitchen for ten minuteswhile you washed a Dutch oven and a pot  --  ' Ten minutes ! ' Fifteen , then . ' A lot you know . Would my husband have sat with me ? Hell no , he 's busy flirting  --  ' Oh , stop that crap . Now : I can even believe that you forgot them next morning . But I can not and will not cater to your lie by trying to believe that you forgot them for the weeks they 've been down there  --  ' It has n't been weeks . ' Now her voice did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cunning.  |p54While  you were describing your ordeal of merging the problem of two dirty pots with the problem of enjoying a party , I was scratching around through my file of memories  --  I have this penchantfor nostalgic memories , you know  --  and what I come up with is this : the party was on Friday , the twenty-first of September ; todayis the twentieth of October ; those pots were there about a month . Are you going to stand there drinking my booze and tell me that you did not miss those pots for one month ? Or , for one month , descend the basement stairs ? ' Then she was throwing things : first the glass , exploding on the wall behind me ; I got up from the chair and ducked the copper ash tray , but she got my shoulder with her lighter . I started toward the kitchen , where the car key hung on a nail ; she got in front of me and choked me with both hands . You crazy bitch  --  ' I shoved hard and she fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came after me but I was gone , slamming the door , leaping from the top step and running across the lawn to the car . I heard the screen door opening then I was in the car , locking all four doors and jabbing the key twice then into the slot and as I turned it and the car started she grabbed the door handle ; I accelerated and was gone . I went to Plum Island and got out and walked on the beach . The moon was out and on the water , and a cold wind blew out to sea . I , walked until I was too cold and Terry was gone , my head clear , I was only shivering and walking . Sometimes I stopped and faced the water , taking deep breaths , the wind pushing at my back . Then I drove to a bar where fishermen and men who worked with their hands sat drinking beer with their big wives . I sat at the bar , turning the stool so my back was to the color television , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I felt good , sitting there in her hatred . I knew what she felt when she came at me with her bright , tearful eyes and shrill voice and reaching , choking hands : she wanted my death . And sitting in the bar , watching the couples , I liked that . I remembered the night I had called my friends to come over and drink ; I had been sitting on the lawn toward evening , drinking beer and watching the children play ; then they came to me and sat on the grass at my feet and I stroked their heads like dogs , and talked to them , and when Terry came out I was telling them a story , makingit up as I went along , and I put them in the story : When Natashaand Sean Were Cowboys , it was called ; they were comic and heroic , mostly heroic , they endured blizzards , they raised a babyp55cougar , they captured an outlaw . While I told the story , Terry barbecued pork chops . I felt serene and loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made me , when the children were in bed , call Hank and Matt and Roger and Jim . Then sitting at that bar , watching the couples who looked past and over me at the movie or variety show or whatever , I rememberedclearly the lawn , the children , the story , and my mood , and I remembered eating dinner on the lawn too : barbecued pork chops , baked beans , green salad , garlic bread  --  I sat in the bar seeing my paper plate in the sunset evening on the lawn , back in September . The baked beans . I saw my fork going into the pile of beans on my plate ; and I remembered later , in the kitchen , Sean and I standing over the Pyrex dish and finishing the last of the beans . She had cooked on the grill and in a Pyrex dish . She had lied . Though at first I thought she had only been mistaken . Because I hate lies so , and I did n't want to believe she would lie . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the story was too good : my mood , my party , had caused her to forget her work . When confronted with the mold and stench of those pots , the urine on the sheets , she reached back for the one night she could use as an excuse . So she avoided work and she lied . Then what does she want ? I thought . What on earth does she want ? And right away I knew : to be beautiful , charming , intelligent , seductive , a good cook , a good drinker , a good fuck . In short , to be loved by men and admired by women . A passive life . A receptive life . I remember once the landlord 's daughter came by , a girl of sixteen ; she wanted to go into the attic , she thought she left her bicycle pump there . It was a Saturday afternoon ; I answered the door and when she told me what she wanted , I thought : A bicycle pump . My pitiful wife is to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it were lived in , not by a family , but a platoon of soldiers holing up before moving on . We had had a party the night before . She had at least moved the party mess to the kitchen , where it still was , along with the breakfast and lunch dishes ; on the table , the countertop , in the sink ; the kitchen floor was sticky with spilled booze ; every bed was unmade ; and so on . I let the girl in , and called Terry to show her to the attic ; then I went out and got Scan and we rode our bicycles along the Merrimack . When we got hack , ' I'crry was standing at the sink , washing dishes.  |p56That  night Uncle Vanya was on NET . By then our house was in reasonable order , and Terry sat drinking beer and watching the play . Laurence Olivier played Doctor Astrov , and when he said : She is beautiful , there 's no denying that , but . . . You know she does nothing but eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beauty  --  nothing more ... And an idle life can not be pure ... ' I wanted to glance at Terry but did not . She sat and watched and when it was over she said , Jesus , ' and weaved upstairs to bed . Next afternoon we were supposed to go hear Cannonball Adderley at Lennie 's ; I had put the money aside on payday ; we were going with Hank and Edith , but all morning and through lunch she said she was n't going , her life had reached a turning point , the landlord'sdaughter ( oh her face ! she said ; she was so hurt , and so  --  scornful ! ) and Uncle Vanya were too much , she would work , she would work , she would start right now by paying for being a slob , she would not go hear Cannonball Adderley . I told her she was being foolish , that if she were serious her house would need a long , thoroughcleaning , and that she might as well wait for Monday morning , the traditional day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't go . So I went , and told Hank and Edith that Terry was turning over leaves . I did n't have to say more ; they like mysteries . Cannonballwas playing at four . I got home about eight . The children were in bed , the kitchen was clean , and in the living room Terry was asleep in the warm hum of her portable hair dryer . The house was neither dirtier nor cleaner than when I left . I never asked how she spent the afternoon . I guessed she did normal surface cleaning , and spent a lot of time with the children ; it 's what she does when she feels guilty . For three days after that she made all the beds as soon as we got up in the morning ; on the fourth day , without a word about Uncle Vanya or girls looking for bicycle pumps , or CannonballAdderley , her slow momentum stopped , like a bicyclist going up a steep hill : she got off and walked the bike . Everything went back to below normal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really gripped it  --  and for how long would she have squeezed if I had n't been able to push her away ? she had right away shut off my windpipe  --  in that bar , I saw something : I saw her sitting with the TV Guide among those dishes , with that look of concentration which was real , yes , but it was n't concentrating on something , it was concentrating away from her work . She was saying no . And I thought : Why , that 's her word : No . It is what she said to the life that waited forp57her each morning , perched on the foot of the bed . She simply refused to live it , by avoiding work , by lying about it , and by  --  yes : I believed it : violence . It was n't me she hated , me she wanted to kill : it was the questions I raised . Yet I could n't really separate my questions from me any more than I could separate Terry from her house . She is what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , I am what I ask . And that is why , I thought , our quarrels usually ended violently : because she could not or would not answer my questions about pots on the stairs and Sean lying in last night 's piss . So she hit me . And now tonight she was out with Hank and I remembered the day I found the pots and went up to the living room and told her and she went downstairs ; I remembered how I stood at the window and watched the couple pushing their baby in a stroller ; the girl was , as I have said , rather plain , and her breasts were a little too small , and her hips a little too wide , but I stood watching her , and that is what I wanted and what I have refused all the years to admit I wanted : a calm , peaceful life with that plain , clean girl pushing her stroller in the sunlight of that afternoon. 3 HE came home long after midnight , an hourand twenty minutes into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where I sat drinking bourbon , having given up on Tolstoy , sitting and sipping now . She stood just inside the door , looking at me , shaking her head : Not this way , Jack . Not after ten  --  ' Then her eyes filled , her lips and cheeks began to contort , she bit off her voice and went to the refrigerator for ice . I stood , to go to her ; but then I did n't move . I stood near the wall and watched her make the drink ; her back was turned , her head lowered , the hair falling on both sides of her face , and I saw us as in a movie and all I had to do now was cross the room and take her shoulders and turn her and look into her eyes , then hold and kiss her . We can try again , I would say . And : Yes , darling , she would say : Oh yes yes . I stood watching her . When she turned , her eyes were dry , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in DiBurro 's , for the first time in my life , alone in a bar- '  |p58What  happened ? ' Never mind what happened . I 've been thinking about love , and I want to tell you this , I want to tell you these things in my heart , but I do n't want to see your face . Your cold , guilty face . ' She sat at the table , facing the back door ; I leaned against the wall , waiting . All right then : I 'll move . ' She turned her chair so she was profiled to me . Do n't worry , you 'll get rid of me some day , but not like this , not this sordid , drunken adultery , do you know  --  no , you would n't because you never look at me  --  do you know that I drink more than any woman we know ? I 'm the only one who gets drunk as the men at parties . I 'm the only one who starts drinking before her husband comes home . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomea statistic . Because , you see , I do n't keep a Goddamn Howard Johnson 's for you , because I read a lot and , you know , think a lot , and I read someplace that booze and suicide claim many of us , us housewives ; did you know that ? No other group in the country goes so often to the bottle and the sleeping pill . I guess that 's how they do it , with pills . Although as a child I knew a woman who played bridge with my mother , she shot herself one afternoon , a tiny hole in the temple , they said  --  from a tiny pistol , Daddy said , a woman 's gun  --  she had been in and out of hospitals like others were in and out of supermarkets  --  maybe there 's not much difference , they 're both either a bother or terminal  --  and she was convincedshe had cancer . That 's what the ladies said , my mother and her friends , but they were n't known for truth , on summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , said trump and no-trump and I pass ; I used to walk through and see their souls rising with the cigarette smoke above their heads . Oh yes , they would rather believe relentless old cancer was eating the bones or liver or lungs of their dead friend than to believe one of the zombies in their midst had chosen one sunny afternoon to rise from the dead . She 's the only suicide I 've known . And I 've only known one alcoholic , unless I 'm one , which I 'm not . I drink a lot at parties and on nights like this one when my husband sends me off to fuck his friend . I do n't drink at lunch or early afternoon , but at ten in the morning a real lush will talk to you smelling of booze , a nice , pleasant enough smell but awfully spooky when the sun 's still low and the dew has n't burned off the grass , like in high school Sue 's mother was an alcoholic , she was rich and lovely so maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to function much anyway . She always smelled of booze , she was usually cheerful and friendly ,  |p59and  you never saw her glass until five o'clock , at the cocktail hour . So much for statistics . ' She went to the sink and poured another bourbon . Do n't you want to stop that ? ' She turned with the ice tray in her hands . Give me a reason , Jack . ' I looked at her for a moment , then I looked around the room and down into my glass . She poured the drink and sat at the table and I watched the side of her face . A man must have done those statistics , ' she said . They sound like a fraud . Because he was treating housewife like a profession , like lawyer or doctor or something , and that 's wrong , he 's includingtoo many of us ; if he had done the same with men , just called them all husbands , you can bet they 'd have the highest rate . Most of them I know are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of cowardly ways ; sometimes in the bank I wait in line and watch the walking suicides there , the men on my side of the counter and on the other , those lowered eyes and turned-down lips and fidgety glances around like God might catch them dying without a fight . So they should classify us if they must classify us by our husbands ' jobs : how many pharmacists ' wives are too drunk to cook at night ? How many teachers ' wives slit their fucking throats ? But that would n't be accurate either . We are an elusive sex , hard to pin down . Though everyone tries to . I know : I have red hair . She has that red-headed temper , Daddy used to say . I was thinking about him tonight . Once when I was ten he took me fishing . We stood barefoot on the sand and cast out into the surf for flounder . The fishing rod was very long ; I had to hold it with two hands and I shuffled forward with my side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging in the sand , then I arced it high over my head and the line went out , not as far as his but better than I had done before , and he said it : That 's better . ' I reeled in praying I 'd hook one , please dear God for one sweet fish . Was n't that absurd ? To think the luck of catching a fish would make me somehow more lovable ? Because then it 'd follow that to be unlucky was to be unlovable , would n't it ? And I must have believed that , as a child . And while I was drinking alone tonight I thought maybe I still believethat . But of course luck is n't an element in my life now . I do n't fish or play cards ; but there 's always skill . So should I expect lily cooking and screwing to make me more lovable ? Maybe . I suppose a mall ca n't he cprctcd to love a wotitan who fails in thep60kitchen and the bed . I 'll admit that  --  even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll admit that first a man has to be well fed and fucked . Only God , my dear , could love you for yourself alone and not your yellow hair . ' What if I cooked badly ? Or were paralyzed and could n't screw ? Because maybe then you do hate me for my house , because it 's dirty some-times  --  ' I do n't hate you . ' She looked at me : only for a moment , then she turned away and finished her drink and rose for another . Terry  --  ' How would you know if you hate me ? You do n't even know me . You say , You are what you do . ' But do you really believe that ? Does that mean I 'm a cook , an errand runner , a fucker , a bed maker , and on and on  --  a Goddamn cleaning woman , for Christ sake ? If you  --  you , you bastard  --  ' looking at me , then looking away  --  lost all discipline , just folded up and turned drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd get a job and support us too . Maybe no one else would love you . You 'd be a different man , to them : your friends and your students . But not to me . I 'd love you . I 'd love you if you went about at night poisoning dogs . So what is it that I love ? If action does n't matter . I love you  --  ' looking at me , then away  --  I love Jack Linhart . And I say you 're more than what you do . But if you love me for what I do instead of for what I am  --  there is a difference , I know there is  --  then what are you loving when I screw Hank ? Because if you love me for what I do then you ca n't want me to be unfaithful because if I screw somebody else it 's because I love him , so either you do n't love me and so you do n't care or you do n't know me and you just love someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is add to my tricks . Screw Hank . Shake hands . Sit , roll over , play dead , fetch  --  loving me like a dog . Because I 'm not like that , I simply love a dog , I had dogs , four of them , they all disappearedor died or got killed , like everything else around here , like me , and I just loved them : fed them and petted them and demanded no tricks . No fucking tricks ! But not you . ' She stood up and looked at me . Am I right ? You do n't love me , you love the tricks ? Is that true ? My stupid spaghetti sauce , the martini waiting in the freezer when you come home in the afternoons , the way I for Christ 's sweet sake look and walk and screw ? ' I love Edith , ' I said , and looked her full in the face ; probably I did n't breathe . Her face jerked back , as if threatened by a blow ; then she was shaking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I said : Terry . Terry , yes : I love her . I do n't love you . Ip61have n't for a long time . I do n't know why . Maybe no one ever knows why . I 'm sorry , Terry , but I ca n't help it , I  --  ' N00000 , ' she wailed , and she was across the room , dropping her glass , tears now , shaking her head just below my face , pounding my chest , not rage but like a foiled child : she could have been striking a table or wall . No , Jack . No , Jack  --  ' Then she shoved me hard against the wall and I bounced off and pushed her with both hands : she fell loudly on her hack , her head thumped the floor , and I crouched with clenched fists , looking down at her frightened face and its sudden pain . She rolled on one side and slowly got up . Come on , ' I said . Come take it . ' She looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . No , you 're right : I 've hit you too much . You 're right to push me down . I 've hit you too much . ' She went to the sink and stood with her back to me , bent over the counter with her head on her arms , one fist in a light rhythmic beat ; after a while she turned . Tears were on her cheeks and she sniffed once and then again . All right . I wo n't cry and I wo n't hit you . Edith . So Edith then . All right . Jesus . ' She looked around for her glass . I moved to pick it up from the floor , but she said , Oh fuck you , ' and I straightened again . She took a glass from the cupboard and poured a long drink ; the ice tray was empty . She went to the refrigerator and put the glass on top of it and opened the freezer compartment , then stood holding the door and looking in at the trays and vapor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry ; but she did n't , and after a while she banged out an ice tray and went to the sink and ran water on the back of the tray and pulled the lever but the ice did n't come out ; then she squeezed the dividers with her hands , then jerked back , dropping the tray and shaking a hand : I hate these Goddamn cutting ice trays . ' She ran hot water again and worked the lever and got some cubes . Then she stood leaning against the stove , facing me across the table . That fucking bitch whore Edith . My fucking friend Edith . So up Terry . Alone then . I should have known . I did know . I knew all the time . I just would n't let myself know that I knew . How long have you been screwing her ? ' ' Max . Late May . ' Yes . I thought so . I thought so tonight going to meet Hank and I thought so while we high school screwed in the car , I saw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't looked at Inc in years , andp62I saw you screwing her and when Hank finished I told him I wanted to be alone , just to take me back to DiBurro 's where my car was . Did you love me until you fell in love with Edith ? ' No . ' I shook my head . No . I guess that 's why I lo  --  ' Do n't say it ! I do n't have to keep hearing that . I  --  ' She lowered her head , the hair covering her eyes , then she went to her purse on the table and got a cigarette and lit it at the stove , holding her hair back behind her neck . When she turned to face me she looked down at the gold wedding ring on her finger , then she twisted it as though to pull it off , but she did n't ; she just kept turning it on her finger and looking at it . We must have had a lot of people fooled . A lot of people will be surprised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm thirty years old , I 've lost my figure  --  ' No , you have n't . ' Do n't , Jack . I 've lost my figure , I 'm not young anymore , I do n't even want to be young anymore , I 've become just about what I 'll become  --  ' I could not look at her : I went to the refrigerator needingmotion more than I needed ale , and got a bottle and opened it and went to the door and stood half-turned , so my back was n't to her but my face was n't either . But there was a time when I wanted to be young again , I never told you that , I did n't see any reason to load you down with it . I remember once nursing Sean when he woke in the night in Ann Arbor , I had the radio on in the kitchen turned down low and listening to music and watching Sean , and of course I loved him but I was almost halfway through my twenties and I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the radio and all at once I was back five years , the year before I met you , the summer I was nineteen and all of us used to go to Carolyn Shea 's house because it was the biggest and her parents were the best , her mother and father would come and talk to us in the den where the record player was , she was just a little patronizingto the girls but not to the boys , only because she was a woman ; but he was n't patronizing to anyone at all . The boys would come over : Raymond Harper and Tommy Zuern and WarrenHuebler and Joe Fleming , and sometimes they 'd bring cherrystones , or steamers , and Mr. Shea would help them open the cherrystonesand if they brought steamers Mrs. Shea would steam them and we 'd sit in the kitchen with beer or wine . We were there all the time , all that summer , and no one was in love with anyone , we all danced and went to movies and the beach , and all that summerp63we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night in Ann Arbor I thought of Raymond getting knocked off a destroyer at night and they never found him , and Tommy got fat and serious , and Joe became an undertaker like his father , and Warren just went away ; and Leslie had an abortion , then married someone else and went to live in Nebraska , and Carolyn married a rich jerk from Harvard Law , and Jo Ann married a peddler and turned dumb to survive , and then there was me nursing my baby in Ann Arbor , Michigan , and I started to cry , loud and shaking , and I thought you 'd hear and think Sean had died and I clamped my teeth shut but I could n't stop crying because I knew my life was gone away because you did n't have a rubber with you because we 'd never made love before  --  and is n't that tender and sweet to think of now ?  --  and I was foolish enough to believe you when you said you would n't come inside me , then foolish enough not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to bed that night with Natasha alive in me and next morning when I woke I knew it . Then you got rubbers but every time I knew it did n't matter ; I gave up hope , but I thought if I was lucky anyway , I 'd start dating others . I would make love with you but I would date others . I was twenty years old . So now you say you do n't love me . You love Edith . ' Her lower lip trembled , then she spun around , her back to me , and slapped the counter with both hands . I wo n't cry . You bastard , you wo n't make me cry . I 've given you my liii f e . ' She wiped her eyes once , quickly , with the back of a hand and faced me again . Oh , how I hate your Goddamn little girl students you bring in here to babysit , those naive , helpless little shits , what I 'd give for their chance , to be young and able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York now , I could be anywhere but no . I had to get married . I should have aborted  --  ' Her voice lowered to almost a whisper , and she stopped glaring at me and looked somewhere to my side , her eyes fixed on nothing , just staring : I thought of it . I did n't get the name of an abortionist but I did get the name of a girl who 'd had one , just by manipulating a conversation I got that done , but I did n't go on . Not because I was scared either . What I was scared of was being knocked up and getting married to my boyfriend . That 's what you were : my boyfriend . But no , not Terry , she wanted to do the right thing . So I did . And now Natasha 's here and so of course I 'm glad I did n't kill her . After you sec a child and give it a name V'ou can never thinls : thou ' abortion . But I 've wasted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't let nn self , I was going to stake thep64best of it , I was going to keep on being a girl in love . All right , then . You 're having an affair with Edith and you love her and you do n't love me . All right . I wo n't cry and I wo n't hit you . When are you leaving ? ' I do n't know . ' You might as well go today . ' I guess so . ' Is Edith leaving ? ' We 've never talked about it . ' Oh , you must have . ' No . ' So you might be like the coyote . ' It was a joke we 'd had from the Roadrunner cartoons ; one of us trying something fearful and new was like the coyote : poised in midair a thousand feet above a canyon and as long as he does n't look down he wo n't fall . It does n't matter , ' I said . I would n't take her from Hank anyway , if he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's me . Well Jesus . I 've been telling you and telling you you do n't love me . But I never really meant it . I never believed it at all . Was it the house ? ' I do n't know . ' No . I guess you ca n't know , anymore than I can know why I still love you . Jack ? ' Her lip trembled . Do n't you love me even a little ? ' I looked above her , over the pots on the stove , at the wall . Then I closed my eyes and shook my head and said : No , Terry . ' Then without looking at her I left . I went to the bedroom and undressed in the dark and got into bed . I heard her in the kitchen , weeping softly . Sometimes I slept and all night she did not come to bed and all night I woke and listened to her . For a while she stayed in the kitchen : she stopped crying and I went to sleep listening to her silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting at the table under the light . I had not been heartbroken since I was very young ; but I could remember well enough what it was like and I wished Terry were leaving me , I wished with all my heart that she had come to me one afternoon and looked at me with pity but resolve and said : I 'm sorry but I must go  --  I wish I were now lying in bed grieving for my wife who had stopped loving me . I rolled one way and then another and then lay on my back and breathed shallowp65and slow as though sleeping , but I could n't ; I felt her sitting in the kitchen and I felt her thinking of me with Edith and me divorced laughing on a sunny sidewalk with some friend , and I felt her heart 's grieving , and then I was nearly crying too . I sat up , slowly shaking my head , then lit a cigarette and lay on my back , listening to her silence , then my legs tightened , ready to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook my head once viciously on the pillow and pushed my legs down against the mattress . Then I heard her taking pots from the stove : footsteps from the stove to the sink , and the sound of the heavy iron skillet lowered into the dry sink , footstepsagain and this time the higher ringing sound of the steel pot and then higher again of the aluminum one . She began scraping one of them with a knife or fork or spoon . She knocked the pot against the inside of the plastic garbage can and started scraping another . Then she washed and dried them and hung them on the pegboard . She ran water into the sink and I lay staring into the night as she washed the dishes . She washed them quickly , then she was moving about and I guessed she was circling the table , wiping it clean , and after that the stove . Still she was moving with quick steps , into the laundry room and out again , to the sink , and she lowered a bucket into it and turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor and sat on the edge of the bed . When she started mopping the floor I went to the kitchen . She knew I was there at the doorway but she did n't look up : she was bent over the stroking sponge mop , her head down , toward me ; water had splashed on the front of her yellow dress ; she was mopping fast , pushing ahead of her a tiny surf of dirty water and soap . Finally she had to stand straight and look at me . Her forehead was dripping , her hair was stringy with sweat , and I could not imagine her with Hank a few hours earlier . Come to bed . ' No . I want to clean my house . I 've been a pig and I 've beaten you and thrown things at you . I know it 's too late for you but maybe not for me , maybe I can at least be good for my babies . Or maybe you 'll miss them and want to come back and the house will be clean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't you be happy then ? ' You do n't want that . ' No , I guess not . ' Mopping again , bent over . I do n't know . Maybe I could change . Co to bed , love ; I want to clean my house . ' I slept light Iv . Sometimes I heard " Ferry moving about the house , and I felt the night leave . ul the day grow lighter and warmer ; atp66one warm and light time I heard a vacuum cleaner beneath my dreams . When I heard the children 's voices I woke up ; but I would not open my eyes . I lay on my side and listened to their voices . After a while I heard Terry upstairs , in Sean 's room above me . She was walking from one spot to another ; then she pushed furniture across the floor . I opened my eyes and looked into the living room : Natasha was standing in the doorway . You should see the house . ' What 's she doing upstairs ? ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's doing the upstairs . ' Sean called from the kitchen : Is that Daddy you 're talking to ? ' I winked at Natasha . Is that true you do n't love Mom ? ' she said . Who told you that ? The morning paper ? ' I heard Mom last night . ' Oh ? Who was she talking to ? ' Sean came in , carrying a full glass of orange juice ; he held it out in front of him , his forearm extended , and watched it while he stiffly walked to the bed . Thanks , chief , ' I said , and kissed him . I could n't hear you , ' Natasha said . Just Mom . ' Are you getting divorced ? ' Sean said . Wow . You really know how to wake a fellow up . ' Upstairs the vacuum cleaner went on . I imagined what Terry had got from under the bed . Natasha said you were leaving . ' ' That 's an idea . Where should I go ? Join the Mounties ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not going to choose , ' Natasha said . Ah mc . You should n't listen to drunk grown-ups fighting , sweetheart . It 's always exaggerated . ' Mom said you were leaving and you love Edith and you screwed her . ' Do you know what that means ? ' Yes . ' What ? ' Sean said . What what means ? ' Nothing , ' I said , looking at him and feeling Natasha 's eyes on me . Just grown-up foolishness . ' I looked at Natasha . Let 's get on our bikes . ' You have n't eaten yet . '  |p67Let  's go to the river , ' Sean said . We 'll stop someplace where I can eat and you two can have something to drink . ' I told them to get the bikes out while I dressed . When they were gone , I called Edith to tell her I could n't meet her . Hank answered . I ca n't run today , ' I said . I 'm sick . The flu . Tell Edith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for spreading it to her friends . ' White clouds were piled in the sky , and from the southwest gray was coming . I led Natasha and Sean in single file down our street , to the river . From our left the air was turning cooler and the gray was coming . We stopped at a small grocery store and got a quart of apple cider and stood on the sidewalk , drinking from the bottle and looking across the blacktop at the dark river . Is it true about you and Edith ? ' There was in her eyes a will to know , a look of deep interest ; nothing more . Is what true ? ' Sean said . He was down there , below our voices and souls , looking at the river . It is and it is n't , ' I said to Natasha 's eyes . I do n't know if I have the wisdom to explain it to a little girl I love . ' She took a quarter from her pocket and gave it to Sean . Go buy us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where 'd you get that ? ' My allowance . ' I ' 11 explain as well as I can , ' I said . I watched her eyes . I do n't want to abort it . ' They had n't changed . What 's that mean ? ' To kill something before it 's fully developed . Like a party you 're planning . Or a baby inside the mother . ' Oh . ' Now I remembered Terry lowering her voice : 1 should have aborted ; even in her raging grief the old instinct of an animal protectingher young was there . Then I looked at the river and the lush woods on the other side , turning bright green as the gray and black moved faster over us ; at the horizon the last puffs of white and strips of blue were like daylight under a tent wall ; I turned from Natasha because there were tears in my eyes , not for her because she was strong and young and there was hope , but for Terry and her trenihling lip : lack ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am afraid of water ; but looking out at the river I wanted suddenly to be in its flow , t timing over once , t wie  --  e , with the current ; going downp68with slow groping arms , and hands opening and shutting on cool muddy death , my hair standing out from my head as I went bubblingdown to the bottom . I shuddered , as much with remorse as fear . Then my wish was over . I stood alive again and breathed the rain-scented air and I knew that I would grow old with Terry . Mother and I have made mistakes , ' I said . She was standing at my side , almost touching ; I kept my eyes on the woods across the river . Sea gulls crossed my vision . You must trust us to make things better for everyone . Your mother and I love each other . She 's a good and wonderful woman , and do n't worry about anything you heard last night , people are all sorts of things , and one mistake is only a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Edith is very good , and  --  ' And so are you , ' she said , and slipped her hand into mine and I could n't go on . The sky was completely gray now and it watched us ride home ; we put our bikes in the garage and crossed the lawn and as we climbed the back steps it began to rain . We stood in the darkened kitchen and watched it coming down hard and loud . Sean was touching my leg . I tousled his hair , then turned on the light . The room changed : when it was dark and we had looked out at a day as dark as our kitchen , I had felt we were still out there in the rain , the three of us , somewhere by the river and trees ; I could live in that peace , from one fresh rain-filled moment to the next , forever . Now with the light we were home again ; our bodies were lightly touching but the flow , the unity , was gone . We were three people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bedroom . Terry was putting my clothes in a suitcase . She looked clean and very tired ; she had showered and changed clothes . She tried to smile , failed , tried again , and made it . Was it awful ? ' she said . Was what awful ? Why are you doing that ? ' I thought that 's where you went . To tell the kids . ' I pushed the suitcase to make room , and lay on the bed ; I would not look at her . Unpack it , ' I said . Why ? Could n't you tell them ? ' I do n't want to . ' ' I ' 11 call them in and we 'll both tell them . ' I mean I do n't want to leave . '  |p69She  stepped closer to the bed and I was afraid she would touch me . You really do n't ? ' No . ' Is it the kids ? I mean I know it 's the kids but is it just the kids ? You could see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never move away , I 'd live here as long as you teach here  --  so if it 's just telling them , we can do it and get it over with , these things are always hard , but we can do it  --  ' It 's not that . ' I shut my eyes . Unpack the suitcase . ' Across the bed I felt her pain and hope . I kept my eyes shut and listened to her moving from the bed to the closet and hanging up my clothes . Then she came around to my side of the bed and sat on the edge and put a hand on my cheek . Hey , ' she said softly . Look at me . ' I did . It 'll be all right , ' she said . You 'll see . It 'll be all right again . ' She slept the rest of the afternoon , then woke to cook dinner ; during dinner she and the children talked , and sometimes I talked with the children , but mostly I listened to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen Terry went back to bed and slept late next morning ; then she called Edith and asked her to go to lunch . Do you have to ? ' I said . She stood in the kitchen , in a short skirt and a bright blouse and a raincoat , looking pretty the way women do when they meet each other for lunch . I 've loved her , ' she said . I want to keep loving her . ' The rain had stopped for a while , but now it was coming down again . They were a long time at lunch ; the children were bored , so I let them watch a movie on television . It was an old movie about British soldiers in India ; I explained to the children that the British had no business being there , then we were all free to enjoy watchingthe British soldiers doing their work . They were all crack shots and awfully brave . The movie had n't ended when Terry came upstairs and , smiling happily , said : Do n't you want to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the rest of this . ' I followed her downstairs and put on some water for one cup of tea . I ler face was loving and forgiving and I could not hear to lookp70at her , I could not bear the images of her in warm collusion with Edith ; for I could see it all : we would gather again in living rooms , the four of us , as though nothing had happened . And perhaps indeednothing had . She wants you to go see her tonight . ' Her cheeks were flushed , her eyes bright , and she smelled of bourbon . She 's going to tell Hank , she 's probably told him by now , she said he wo n't mind  --  ' I know . ' Bubbles were forming beneath the water in the pot . I held the cup with the tea bag and waited . I told her about Hank and me , right away , as soon as I 'd told her I knew about you two , and it 's all right , I told her it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to steal you or anything , it was to save herself , she said , and  --  ' I do n't want to hear it . ' You do n't ? ' No . I do n't know why . I just do n't . ' The water was boiling , and I poured it into the cup . I 'm sorry , ' I said . I 'm sure it was a fine afternoon with Edith . ' It was . ' I looked at her . She was watching me with pity . It was wonderful . ' I went upstairs . Going up , I could hear the rifles cracking . That night I went to see Edith and Hank . They were drinking coffee at the kitchen table ; the dishes were still there from dinner , and the kitchen smelled of broiled fish . From outside the screen door I said hello and walked in . Have some coffee , ' Hank said . I shook my head and sat at the table . A drink ? ' he said . Aye . Bourbon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll take in a movie , ' Hank said . Edith was holding the bottle and watching me , and it was her face that told me how close I was to crying . I shook my head : There 's no need  --  ' But he was up and starting for the back door , squeezing my shoulderas he passed . I followed him out . Hank  --  ' He turned at his car . Listen , I ought to dedicate my novel to you . ' He smiled and tookp71my hand . You helped get it done . It 's so much easier to live with a woman who feels loved . ' We stood gripping hands . Jack ? You okay , Jack ? ' I 'm okay . I 'll be laughing soon . I 'm working on the philosophy of laughter . It is based on the belief that if you 're drowning in shit , buoyancy is the only answer . ' When I got back to the kitchen , Edith was waiting with the drink . I took it from her and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd guessed long ago , ' she said . He said he was happy for us and now he 's sad for us . Which means he was happy you were taking care of me and now he 's sorry you ca n't . ' I reached down for the drink and , still holding her , drank it fast over her shoulder and then quietly we went to the guest room . In the dark she folded back the spread and sheet ; still silent and standing near each other we slowly undressed , folding clothes over the backs of chairs , and I felt my life was out of my hands , that I must now play at a ritual of mortality and goodbye , the goodbye not only to Edith but to love itself , for I would never again lie naked with a woman I loved , and in bed then I held her tightly and in the hard grip of her arms I began to shudder and almost wept but did n't , then I said : I ca n't make love , I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek and for a long while we quietly held each other and then I got up and dressed and left her naked under the sheet and went home . Like a cat with corpses , Terry brings me gifts I do n't want . When I come home at night she hands me a drink ; she cooks better than any woman I know , and she watches me eat as though I were unwrappinga present that she spent three months finding . She never fails to ask about my day , and in bed she responds to my hesitant , ambivalent touch with a passion I can never match . These are the virtues she has always had and her failures , like my own , have not changed . Last summer it took the house about five weeks to beat her : she fought hard but without resilience ; she lost a series of skirmishes , attacks from under beds , from closets , the stove , the vegetable bin , the laundry basket . Finally she had lost everything and since then she has waked each day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wakes passively , without a plan ; she waits to see What the ( la ' hi-ing , and so it brings her its worst : potsp72and clothes and floors wait to be cleaned . We are your day , they tell her . She pushes them aside and waits for something better . We do n't fight about that anymore , because I do n't fight ; there is no reason to . Except about Edith , she is more jealous than ever ; perhaps she is too wise to push me about Edith ; but often after parties she accuses me of flirting . I probably do , but it is meaningless , it is a jest . She is n't violent anymore . She approaches me with troubled eyes and says maybe she 's wrong but it seemed to her that I was a long time in the kitchen with  --  I assure her that she 's wrong , she apologizes , and we go to bed . I make love to her with a detachment that becomes lust . Now that it is winter the children and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side in the cellar , the three of them waiting , as Sean says , for spring and summer . We go sledding . The college has a hill where students learn to ski and on weekends it is ours ; Natasha and Sean always beg Terry to come with us and she always says no , she has work to do , she will go another time . I know what it costs her to say this , I know how she wants to be with us , all of us going shrilly down the hill , and then at the top a thermos of chocolate for the children and a swallow of brandy for mama and papa . But she knows that with the children I 'm happy , and she always says she will go another time . We sled and shout for a couple of hours until we 're wet and cold , and when we come home with red cheeks Terry gives us hot chocolate . Last week Hank sold his novel , and Saturday night he and Edith gave a party to celebrate . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky was blue then ; later in the afternoon clouds came and by night snow was falling . When I went up to his office he had finishedwriting ( he has started another novel ) and his girl was there ; she is nineteen , a student , and she has long blonde hair and long suede boots and the office smelled of her cigarette smoke . Hank has not started smoking again . He is very discreet about his girl and I think only Terry and I know ; we do n't talk about it , Terry and I , because she ca n't . I know it bothers her that she ca n't , I know she wishes she were different , but she is n't . Edith knows too , about Hank and his girl ; they do n't lie to each other anymore . It 's not love , ' she said that night at the party . We had gone to the front porch to breathe and watch the snow . It 's marriage . We have a good home for Sharon . We respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you could have : it 's enough . It 's sad , watching you two . She loves you and you never touch her , youp73do n't look at her when you talk . Last summer , after we stopped seeing each other , I went to the zoo that week , I took Sharon to the zoo ; and we went to see the gorilla : he was alone in his cage , and there were women with their children watching him . They 're herbivores  --  didyou know that ? They 're gentle herbivores . I do n't like zoos anyway and I should n't have gone but it was such an awfulweek , finding out how to live this time , I 'd been through that in May and then there was you and then in July there was n't , so I took Sharon to the zoo . And I looked in the gorilla 's eyes and he looked so human  --  you know ?  --  as if he knew everything , how awfully and hopelessly and forever trapped he was . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at us looking at him , all the young mothers in their pants and skirts the colors of sherbet and the jabbering children . Then he reached down like this and shit in his hand . He was watching us . He held up the handful of shit  --  ' and she held her hand up , shoulder-high , palm toward me  --  and then he brought it to his mouth and licked it . His eves were darting from side to side , watching us . They were merry and mischievous , his eyes . Then he licked it again . Around me the mothers were gasping and some of the children were laughing ; then they all hurried away . Murmuring . Distracting their children . But I stayed , and he looked at me like he was smiling and then he showed me his shit again and then he licked it and then he showed it to me again ; he almost looked inquisitive ; but by then I was squeezing Sharon 's hand and looking in his eyes and I was crying , standing there weepingon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched me for a while , curious at first , and then he lowered his hand with the shit and we just stood looking at each other , he was looking into my eyes , and he knew that I knew and I knew that he knew , and if he could have cried he would have too . Then I left . And after a few weeks when I was able to see someone besides myself I 'd see you and I 'd think of that trapped gorilla , standing in his cage and licking his own shit . And I wanted to cry for you too  --  not just me , because I love you and ca n't touch you , ca n't be alone with you , but I wanted to cry for you . And I did . And I still do . Or at least I feel like it , I cry down in my soul . Oh Jack  --  are you trying at all ? ' There 's nothing to try with . ' I could not look at her eves , for I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I moved to the window and looked in ; from the couch Terry looked up and smiled ; she held the smile whenp74Edith moved into her vision and stood beside me . I turned from the window . Around the streetlight the falling snow was lovely . Terry had stopped watching us after the smile ; she was talking ardently with Hank and Roger , and I thought poised like that  --  a little high on bourbon , talking , being listened to , being talked to  --  she was probably happy . I raised my glass to the snow and the night . Here 's to the soul of Jack Linhart : it has grown chicken wings and flaps near the ground . ' I drank . I shall grow old and meek and faithful beside her , and when the long winter comes  --  ' I drank  --  and her hair is white as snow I shall lay my bent old fingers on her powdered cheek and  --  ' I love you . ' Do you still ? ' Always . ' And live with Hank . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' And he 's got a Goddamn  --  All right : I 'm sorry . It 's bitterness , that 's all ; it 's  --  ' I do n't care if he has a girl . ' You really do n't ? ' Some women take up pottery , some do knitting . ' Oh . ' Yes . ' I guess I did n't want to know that . ' I 'm sorry . ' Jesus . Oh Jesus Christ , I really did n't want to know that . Course there 's no reason for you not to have someone , when I ca n't , when I  --  Jesus  --  ' I went inside and got drunk and lost track of Terry until two in the morning , when she brought my coat . I told her I was too drunk to drive . In the car I smelled her perfume , and I thought how sad that is , the scent of perfume on a rejected woman . Edith has a lover , ' I said . I know . She told me a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to ? ' No . ' We do n't anyway . ' Why did n't you tell me ? ' I did n't want to talk about it . I think it 's sad . ' It makes her happy . '  |p75I  do n't believe it . ' Oh , you ca n't tell . ' Please do n't , ' she said . She was leaning forward , looking into the snow in the headlights . I know you do n't love me . Maybe someday you will again . I know you will . You 'll see , Jack : you will . But please do n't talk like that , okay ? Please , because  --  ' Her voice faltered , and she was quiet . While she took the sitter home I sat in the dark living room , drinking an ale and looking out the window . In the falling snow I saw a lover for Terry . I went to bed before she got home and next morning I woke first . The sky had cleared and the snow was hard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the kitchen Natasha and Sean came downstairs . Get dressed , ' I said . We 'll go buy a paper . ' We should go sledding , ' Sean said . All right . ' Before breakfast ? ' Natasha said . Why not ? ' We 've never gone first thing in the morning , ' Sean said . It 'll be neat . ' Okay , ' Natasha said . Is Mom awake ? ' No . ' We 'll write her a note . ' Okay . You write it . And be quiet going upstairs . ' We will , ' Sean said , and he was gone up the stairs . What should I write ? ' That we 're going sledding at nine and we 'll be back about eleven , hungry as hell . ' I 'll just say hungry . ' I got my coat and filled its pockets with oranges , then went outside and shoveled the driveway while they dressed warmly for the cold morning.  |p76Over  the HillHER hand was tiny . He held it gently , protectively , resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the back of his hand , the smoothflesh gentle and tender against his palm . He looked at her face , which seemed no larger than a child 's and she smiled . You buy me another drink ? ' she said . Sure . ' He motioned to the bartender , who filled the girl 's shot glass with what was supposedly whiskey , though Gale knew it was not and did n't care , then mixed bourbon and water for Gale , using the fifth of Old Crow that three hours earlier he had brought into the bar . I 'll be right back , ' he said to the girl . She nodded and he released her hand and slid from the stool . You stay here , ' he said . Sure I stay . ' He walked unsteadily past booths where Japanese girls drank with sailors . In the smelly , closet-sized restroom he closed the door and urinated , reading the names of sailors and ships written on the walls , some of them followed by obscenities scrawled by a different , later hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet and reaching up , his coat tightening at the armpits and bottom rib , he printed with a ballpoint pen , stopping often to shake ink down tothe point again : Gale Castete , Pvt . USMC , Marine Detachment , USS Vanguard Dec /961 . He stood on the toilet with one hand against the door in front of him , reading his name . Then he thought of her face tilted back , the roots of her hair brown near the foreheadwhen it was time for the Clairol again , the rest of it spreading pale blonde around her head , the eyes shut , the mouth half open , teeth visible , and the one who saw this now was not hini  --  furiouslyp77he reached up to write an obscenity behind his name , then stopped ; for reading it again , he felt a gentle stir of immortality , faint as a girl 's whispering breath into his ear . He stepped down , was suddenlynauseated , and left the restroom , going outside into the alley behind the bar , where he leaned against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to the cold air . Two Japanese girls entered the alley from a door to his left and walked past him as if he were not there , arms folded and hands in their kimono sleeves , their lowered heads jabbering strangely , like sea gulls . He took out his billfold , which bulged with wide folded yen and tried unsuccessfully to count it in the dark . He thought there should be around thirty-six thousand , for the night before  --  at sea  --  he had received the letter , and that morning when they tied up in Yokosuka he had drawn one hundred and fifty dollars , which was what he had saved since the cruise began in August because she wanted a Japanese stereo ( and china and glassware and silk and wool and cashmere sweaters and a transistor radio ) and in two more paydays she would have had at least the stereo . That evening he had left the ship with his money and two immediate goals : to get falling , screaming drunk and to get laid , two things he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to ; or so he thought . But first he called home  --  Louisiana  --  to hear from her what his mother had already told him in the letter , and her vague answers cost him thirty dollars . Then he bought the Old Crow and went into the bar and the prettiest hostess came and stood beside him , her face level with his chest though he sat on a barstool , and she placed a hand on his thigh and said Can I sit down ? and he said Yes , would you like a drink ? and she said Yes , sank you and sat down and signaledthe bartender and said My name Betty-san and he said What is your Japanese name ? She told him but he could not repeat it , so she laughed and said You call me Betty-san ; he said okay , l am Gale . Gale-san ? Is girl 's name . No , he said , it 's a man 's . Now he buttoned his collar and slipped his tie knot into place and went inside . You gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back ship . ' No . S'koshi sick . Maybe I wo n't go back ship . ' You better go . They put you in monkey house . ' Maybe so . ' He raised his glass to the bartender and nodded at Betty , then looked at the cuff of his sleeve , at the red hashmark which branded him as a man wit It four N'ears ' service and no rank  --  three years inp78the Army and eighteen months in the Marines  --  although eight months earlier he had been a private first class , nearly certain that he would soon be a lance corporal , then walking back to the ship one night in Alameda , two sailors called him a jarhead and he fought them both and the next day he was reduced to private . He was twenty-four years old . I sink you have sta'side wife , ' Betty said . How come ? ' You all time quiet . All time sink sink sink . ' She mimicked his brooding , then giggled and shyly covered her face with both hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dat 's true ? ' He nodded . While you in Japan she butterfly girl ? ' Yes . ' How you know ? ' My mama-san write me a letter . ' Dat 's too bad . ' Maybe I take you home tonight , okay ? ' We 'll see . ' When ? ' Bar close soon . ' You 're very pretty . ' You really sink so ? ' Yes . ' She brought her hands to her face , moved the fingertips up to her eyes . You like Japanese girl ? ' Yes , ' he said , Very much . ' Now he could not sleep and he wishedthey had not gone to bed so soon , for at least as they walked rapidlyover strange , winding , suddenlyquiet streets he had thought of nothing but Betty and his passion , stifled for four and a half months , but now he lay smoking , vaguelyconscious of her foot touching his calf , knowing the Corporal of thep79Guard had already recorded his absence , and he felt helpless before the capricious forces which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had married her in June , two months before the cruise , and their transition from courtship to marriage involved merely the assumption of financial responsibility and-an adjustment to conflicting habits of eating , sleeping , and using the bathroom , for they had been making love since their third date , when he had discovered that he not only was not her first , but probably was not even her fourth or fifth . In itself , her lack of innocencedid not disturb him . His moral standards were a combination of Calvinism ( greatly dulled since leaving home four and a half years earlier ) , the pragmatic workings of the service , and the ability to think rarely in terms of good and evil . Also , he had no illusions about girls and so on that third date he was not shocked . But afterwardhe was disturbed . Though he was often tormented by visions of her past , he never asked her about it and he had no idea of how many years or boys , then men , it entailed ; but he felt that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was nineteen ) Dana had somehow cheated him , as if his possession of her was retroactive . He also feared comparison . But most disturbing of all was her casual worldliness : giving herself that first time as easily as , years before , high school girls had given a kiss , and her apparent assumption that he did not expect a lengthy seduction any more than he expected to find that she was a virgin . It was an infectious quality , sweeping him up , making him feel older and smarter , as if he had reached the end of a prolonged childhood . But at the same time he sensed his destruction and , for moments , he looked fearfully into her eyes . They were blue . When she was angry they became suddenly hard , harder than any Gale had ever seen , and looking at them he always yielded , afraid that if he did not she would scream at him the terrible silent things he saw there . His memories of the last few days before the cruise  --  the drive in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his parents ' home  --  were filled with images of those eyes as they reacted to the heat and dust or a flintless cigarette lighter or his inability to afford a movie or an evening of drinking beer . He took her home because in Alameda she had lived with her sister and brother-in-law ( she had no parents : she told him they were killed in a car accident when she was fifteen , but for some reason lie did not believe her ) and she did not like her sister ; shep80wanted to live alone in their apartment , but he refused , saying it was a waste of money when she could live with her sister or his parentswithout paying rent . They talked for days , often quarreling , and finally , reluctantly , she decided to go to Louisiana , saying even that would be better than her sister 's . So he took her home , emergingfrom his car on a July afternoon , hot and tired but boyishly apprehensive , and taking her hand he led her up the steps and onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a carpenter  --  hadsquinted down at him standing in the yard and said : So you joined the Army . Well , maybe they can make something out of you . I shore could n't do no good. 3 TRANCE fish and octopus and squid were displayeduncovered in front of markets , theirodors pervading the street . The morningwas cold , damp , and gray : so much like a winter day in Louisiana that Gale walked silently with Betty , thinkingof rice fields and swamps and ducks in a gray sky , and of the vanished faces and impersonal bunks which , during his service years , had been his surroundings but not his home . They walked in the street , dodging through a succession of squat children with coats buttoned to their throats and women in kimonos , stooped with the weight of babies on their backs , and young men in business suits who glanced at Gale and Betty , and young girls who looked like bar hostesses and , like Betty , wore sweaters and skirts ; men on bicycles , their patient faces incongruous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and small taxis sounded vain horns and braked and swerved and shifted gears until they had moved through the passive faces and were gone . Bars with American names were on both sides of the street . Betty entered one of the markets and , after pausing to look at the fish outside , Gale followed her and looked curiously at rows of canned goods with Japanese labels , then stepped into the street again . Above the market a window slid open and a woman in a kimono looked down at the street , then slowly laid her bedding on the market roof and , painfully , Gale felt the serenity of the room behind her . Betty came out of the market , carrying a paper bag . Now I make you sukiyaki , ' she said.  |p81Good  . I need some shaving gear first . ' Okay . We go Japanese store . ' Where is it ? ' Not far . You sink somebody see you ? ' Naw . Everybody 's on the ship now . They 'll be out this after-noon . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in monkey house ? ' Right . ' When you go back ? ' Next week . Before she goes to sea . ' Maybe you better go now . ' They 'd lock me up anyhow . One day over the hill or six , it does n't matter . ' Here 's store . ' You buy ' em . They would n't understand me . ' What you want ? ' Shaving cream , razor , and razor blades . ' He gave her a thousand yen. bat 's too much . ' Keep the rest . ' Sank you . You nice man . ' She went into the drugstore . He waited , then took her bags when she came out and , walking hack to her house , treating her with deference and marveling at her femininity and apparent purity and honesty , he remembered how it was with Dana at first , how he had gone to the ship each morning feeling useful and involved with the world and he had had visions of himself as a salty , leather-faced , graving sergeant-major.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could even find her and even when we got out there she told us she was n't coming with us , she was going to stay with him and it took your daddy about a hour to talk her into coming with us and you know how mad he gets , I do n't see how he did n't whip her good right there , that 's what I felt like doing , and it 's a good thing that boy was n't there or 1 know your daddy would killed him . I do n't know how long it was going on bef ore , she used to go out at night in your car , she 'd tell us she was going to a show and I guess we should havep82said no or followed her or something but you just do n't know at the time , then Sunday she did n't come home and her suitcase was gone so I guess she packed it while I was taking a nap and stuck it in the car . I hate to be writing this but I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife is running around like that . We 'll keep her here tit you tell us what your going to do , she do n't have any money and daddy has the car keys . Tell us what your goingto do , I hope its divorse because she 's no good for you . I hate to say it but 1 could tell soon as I seen her , theres something about a girl of her kind and you just married too fast . Its no good around here , she stays in your room most of the time and just goes to the kitchen when she feels like it at all hours and gets something to eat by herself and I do n't think we said three words since we got her backHe returned the letter to his pocket , lighted a cigarette , poured another glass of dark , burning rum that a British sailor had left with Betty months before , and looked at his watch . It was seven o'clock ; Betty had been gone an hour , promising to wake him when she came home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Betty kneeling on the opposite side of the low table , cookingand serving as he ate , shaking her head each time he asked her to eat instead of cook , assuring him that in Japan the woman ate last ; he ate , sitting cross-legged on the floor until his legs cramped , then he straightened them and leaned back on one arm , the other hand proudly and adeptly manipulating a pair of chopsticks or lifting a tumbler of hot sake to his lips . After eating she turned on the televisionset and they sat on the floor and watched it for the rest of the afternoon . She reacted like a child : laughing , frowning , watching intently . He understood nothing and merely held her hand and smoked until near evening , when they watched an American Westernwith Japanese dialogue and he smiled . Now he rose , brought the rum and his glass to the bedroom , undressed , went back to the living room for an ash tray and cigarettes , then lay in bed and pulled the blankets up to his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belly , knowing that he could not take her back and could not divorce her ; then he started drinking rum again , with the final knowledge that he did not want to live.  |p83HE  stood in the Detachment office , hislegs spread , his hands behind hisback , and stared at the white bulkheadbehind the Marine captain . That afternoon , as his defense counsel told the court why he had gone over the hill , he had felt like crying and now , faced with compassion , he felt it again . But he would not . He had waited two weeks at sea for his court-martial and every night , sober and womanless and without mail , he had lain in bed with clenched jaws and finally slept without crying . Now he shut his eyes , then opened them again to the bulkhead and the voice . If you had told me about it , I would 've got you off the ship . Emergency leave . I 'd have flown you back . Why did n't you tell us ? ' I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I want you to know what 's going to happen . They gave you three months confinement today . We do n't keep people in the ship 's brig over thirty days , so you 'll be sent to Yokosuka when we get back there and you 'll serve the rest of your sentence in the Yokosuka brig . So we 'll have to transfer you to the Marine Barracks at Yokosuka . When you get out of the brig , you 'll report there for duty . Do you understand all that ? ' No , sir . ' What do n't you understand ? ' When will I get back to the States ? ' You 'll finish your overseas tour with the Barracks at Yokosuka . You 'll be there about a year . ' A year , sir ? ' Yes . I 'm sorry . But by the time you get out of the brig , the ship will be back in the States . ' Yes , sir . ' One other thing . You 've worked in this brig . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prisoner chasers . While you 're down there , I expect you to be a number one prisoner . Do n't give your fellow Marines a hard time . ' Yes , sir . ' All right . If you need any help with your problem , let me know . ' Yes , sir . ' He waited , blinking at the bulkhead . ' That 's all , ' the captain said . He clicked his heels together , pivoted around , and strode out . Ap84chaser with a nightstick was waiting for him outside the door . Gale stopped . Son of a bitch , ' he whispered . They 're sending me to Yokosuka . ' Go to your wall locker and get your toilet articles and cigarettes and stationery , ' the chaser said . Gale marched to his bunk , the chaser behind him , and squatted , opening the small bulkhead locker near the head of his bunk , which was the lower one , so that his hands were concealed by the two bunks above his and he was able to slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his palm . He packed his shaving kit with one hand and brought the other to his waist and tucked the razor blade under his belt . He rose and the chaser marched him to the brig on the third deck , where Fisher , the turnkey , took his shaving kit and stationery and cigarettes from him and put them in a locker . It 's letter-writing time now , ' Fisher said . You can sit on the deck and write a letter . ' Sir , Prisoner Castete would like to smoke . ' Only after meals . You missed the smoke break . ' Sir , Prisoner Castete will write a letter . ' Fisher gave him his stationery and pen and he sat on the deck beside two sailors who glanced at him , then continued their writing . He did not write . He sat for half an hour thinking of her scornful , angry , blue eves looking at him or staring at the living room wall in Louisiana as she spoke loudly into the telephone : What do you expect me to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet you 're not just sitting around over there in Japan . No ! I have n't done a damn thing . Goddamnit , Dana , I love you . Do you love me ? I do n't know . Do you love him ? I do n't know . What are you going to do ? What do you mean , what am I going to do ? Well , you have to do something ! It looks like I 'm going to sit right here in this house . That 's not what  --  oh you Goddamn bitch , you dirty Goddamn bitch , how could you do it to me when I love you and I never even looked at these gooks , you 're killing me , Dana , sonofabitch you 're killing meSon . Son !  |p85Mania  ? She was going to hang up on you and you calling all the way from Japan and spending all that moneyWere you standing right there ? Yes , and I could n't stand it , the way she was talking to you  --  WVhy were you standing there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone rings in my own house and my boy'sNever mind . Where 's Dana ? In the bedroom , I guess . I do n't know . Let me talk to her . She wo n't come . You did n't ask her . Gale , you 're wasting time and money . Mama , would you please call her to the damn phone ? All right , wait a minute . What do you want ? Dana , we got to talk . How can we talk when your mother 's standing right here and you 're across the ocean spending a fortune ? If I write you a letter , will you answer it ? Yes . What ? Yes ! I got to know everything , all about it . Did you think you loved him ? I do n't know . Is he still hanging around ? No . Dana , I love you . Have you ever run around on me before this ? No . Why did you do it ? I told you I do n't know ! Why do n't you leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Bye . Answer my letter . 1 love you . Bye . The letter-writing period ended and he handed the blank paperand pen to Fisher , who started to say something but did not . Gale did not start crying until after he was put into a cell and the door waS locked behind hint and he had unfolded his rubber mar/tress and was holding one end of it under his chin and with both hands was working it into a mattress cover and he thought of Dana , then of himself , preparing his bed in a cell thousands of miles away , then he started , the tears flowing soundlessly down his cheeks until he was blinded and could not see his hands or even the mattress and it seemed that he would never get the cover on it and he desperately wanted someone to do it for him and lay the mattress on the deck and turn back the blanket and speak his name . He dropped the mattress , threw the cover against the bulkhead , unfolded the blanket , and lay down and covered himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt , touching it to his left wrist , for a moment just touching , then pressing , then he slashed , knowing in that instant of cutting that he did not want to ; that if he had , he would have cut an artery instead of the veins where now the blood was warm and fast , going down his forearm , and when it reached the inside of his elbow he said : Fisher . ' But there was no answer , so he threw off the blanket and stood up , this time veiling it : Fisher ! ' Fisher came to the door and looked through the bars and Gale showed him the wrist ; he said sonofabitch and was gone , coming back with the keys and opening the door , pulling Gale out into the passageway and grabbing the wrist and tying a handkerchief around it , muttering . You crazy bastard . What are you ? Crazy ? ' Then he ran to the phone and dialed the dispensary , watching Gale , and when he hung up he said : Lie on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Gale lay on the deck and Fisher turned a waste basket on its side and rolled it under his legs , then threw a blanket over him . Son of a bitch ! ' he said . ' They 'll hang me . How 'd you get that Goddamn razor ? '  |p87THE  doctor was tall , with short gray hair and a thin gray moustache . He was a commander , so at least there was that much , at least they did n't send a lieutenant . The doctor filled his cup at the percolator , then faced Gale and looked at him , then came closer until Gale could smell the coffee . You did n't do a very good job , did you , son ? ' ' No , sir . ' Do you ever do a good job at anything ? ' No , sir . ' The doctor 's eves softened and he raised his cup to his lips , watching Gale over its rim , then he lowered the cup and swallowed and wiped his mouth with the back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , without any more silly ideas . I 'll see you tomorrow and we 'll talk about it . ' Yes , sir . ' Gale stepped into the passageway where the chaser was waiting and they marched down the long portside passageway , empty and darkened save for small red lights , Gale staring ahead , conscious of the bandage on his wrist as though it were an emblem of his uncertaintyand his inability to change his life . He knew only that he faced a year of waiting for letters that would rarely come , three months of that in the brig- where he would lie awake and wonder who shared her bed and , once released from the brig , he would have to return to Betty or find another girl so he would not have to think of Dana every night ( although , resolving to do this , he already knew it would be in vain ) ; and that , when he finally returned to the States , his life would be little more than a series of efforts to avoid being deceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one last pitiless glare  --  leave him forever . All this stretched before him , as immutable as the long passageway where he marched now , the chaser in step behind him , yet he not only accepted it , but chose it . He figured that it was at least better than nothing.  |p88The  DoctorIN late March , the snow began to melt . Firstit ran off the slopes and roads , and thebrooks started flowing . Finally there wereonly low , shaded patches in the woods . In April , there were four days of warm sun , and on the first day Art Castagnetto told Maxine she could put away his pajamas until next year . That night he slept in a T-shirt , and next morning , when he noticed the pots on the radiators were dry , he left them empty . Maxine did n't believe in the first day , or the second , either . But on the third afternoon , wearing shorts and a sweat shirt , she got the charcoal grill from the garage , put it in the backyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some tonic and limes for the gin . It was a Saturday afternoon ; they sat outside in canvas lawn chairs and told Tina , their four-year-old girl , that it was all right to watch the charcoal but she must n't touch it , because it was burning even if it did n't look like it . When the steaks were ready , the sun was behind the woods in back of the house ; Maxine brought sweaters to Art and the four children so they could eat outside . Monday it snowed . The snow was damp at first , melting on the dead grass , but the flakes got heavier and fell as slowly as tiny leaves and covered the ground . In another two days the snow melted , and each gray , cool day was warmer than the one before . Saturday afternoon the sky started clearing ; there was a sunset , and before going to bed Art went outside and looked up at the stars . In the morning , he woke to a bedroom of sunlight . He left Maxine sleeping , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carrying his sweat suit he went downstairs , tiptoeing because the children slept so lightly on weekends . He dropped his sweat suit into the basket for dirty clothes ; he was finished with it until next fall . He did side-straddle hops on the front lawn and then ran on thep89shoulder of the road , which for the first half mile was bordered by woods , so that he breathed the scent of pines and , he believed , the sunlight in the air . Then he passed the Whitfords ' house . He had never seen the man and woman but had read their name on the mailboxand connected it with the children who usually played in the road in front of the small graying house set back in the trees . Its dirt yard was just large enough to contain it and a rusting Ford and an elm tree with a tire-and-rope swing hanging from one of its branches . The house now was still and dark , as though asleep . He went around the bend and , looking ahead , saw three of the Whitfordboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had its prettiest days in winter when it was frozen ; in the first weeks of spring , it ran clearly , but after that it became stagnant and around July it dried . This brook was a landmark he used when he directed friends to his house . You get to a brook with a stone bridge , ' he 'd say . The bridge was n't really stone ; its guard walls were made of rectangular concrete slabs , stacked about three feet high , but he liked stone fences and stone bridges and he called it one . On a slope above the brook , there was a red house . A young childless couple lived there , and now the man , who sold life insurance in Boston , was driving off with a boat and trailer hitched to his car . His wife waved goodbye from the driveway , and the Whitford boys stopped throwing rocks into the brook long enough to wave too . They heard Art 's feet on the blacktop and turned to watch him . When he reached the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and Art smiled and said Hello ' to them as he passed . Crossing the bridge , he looked down at the brook . It was moving , slow and shallow , into the dark shade of the woods . About a mile past the brook , there were several houses , with short stretches of woods between them . At the first house , a family was sitting at a picnic table in the side yard , reading the Sunday paper . They did not hear him , and he felt like a spy as he passed . the next family , about a hundred yards up the road , was working . Two little girls were picking up trash , and the man and woman Were digging a flower bed . The parents turned and waved , and the man called , ' It 's a good day for it ! ' At the next house , a young couple were washing their Volkswagen , the girl using the hose , the man scrubbing away the dirt of winter . They looked up and waved . By now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his second wind.  |p90All  up the road it was like that : people cleaning their lawns , washing cars , some just sitting under the bright sky ; one large bald man lifted a beer can and grinned . In front of one house , two teenageboys were throwing a Frisbee ; farther up the road , a man was gently pitching a softball to his small son , who wore a baseball cap and choked up high on the bat . A boy and girl passed Art in a polishedgreen M.G. , the top down , the girl 's unscarfed hair blowing across her cheek as she leaned over and quickly kissed the boy 's ear . All the lawn people waved at Art , though none of them knew him ; they only knew he was the obstetrician who lived in the big house in the woods . When he turned and jogged back down the road , they waved or spoke again ; this time they were not as spontaneous but more casual , more familiar . He rounded a curve a quarter of a mile from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Whitford boys were gone too . On this length of road he was alone , and ahead of him squirrels and chipmunks fled into the woods . Then something was wrong  --  he felt it before he knew it . When the two boys ran up from the brook into his vision , he started sprinting and had a grateful instant when he felt the strength left in his legs , though still he did n't know if there was any reason for strength and speed . He pounded over the blacktop as the boys scrambled up the lawn , toward the red house , and as he reached the bridge he shouted . They did n't stop until he shouted again , and now they turned , their faces pale and open-mouthed , and pointed at the brook and then ran back toward it . Art pivoted off the road , leaning backward as he descended the short rocky bank , around the end of the bridge , seeing first the white rectangle of concrete lying in the slow water . And again he felt before he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent over the slab and getting his fingers into the sand beneath it before he looked down at the face and shoulders and chest . Then he saw the arms , too , thrashing under water as though digging out of caved-in snow . The boy 's pale hands did not quite reach the surface . In perhaps five seconds , Art realized he could not lift the slab . Then he was running up the lawn to the red house , up the steps and shoving open the side door and yelling as he bumped into the kitchen table , pointing one hand at the phone on the wall and the other at the woman in a bright yellow halter as she backed away , her arms raised before her face.  |p91Fire  Department ! A boy 's drowning ! ' Pointing behind him now , toward the brook . She was fast ; her face changed fears and she moved toward the phone , and that was enough . He was outside again , sprinting out of a stumble as he left the steps , darting between the two boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He refused to believe it was this simple and this impossible . He thrust his hands under the slab , lifting with legs and arms , and now he heard one of the boys moaning behind him , It fell on Terry , it fell on Terry . ' Squatting in the water , he held a hand over the Whitford boy 's mouth and pinched his nostrilstogether ; then he groaned , for now his own hand was killing the child . He took his hand away . The boy 's arms had stopped moving  --  they seemed to be resting at his sides  --  and Art reached down and felt the right one and then jerked his own hand out of the water . The small arm was hard and tight and quivering . Art touched the left one , running his hand the length of it , and felt the boy 's fingers against the slab , pushing . The sky changed , was shattered by a smoke-gray sound of winternights  --  the fire horn  --  and in the quiet that followed he heard a woman 's voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing beside him in the water , and he suddenly wanted to be held , his breast against hers , but her eyes shrieked at him to do something , and he bent over and tried again to lift the slab . Then she was beside him , and they kept trying until ten minutes later , when four volunteer firemen descended out of the dying groan of the siren and splashed into the brook . No one knew why the slab had fallen . Throughout the afternoon , whenever Art tried to understand it , he felt his brain go taut and he tried to stop but could n't . After three drinks , he thought of t he slab as he always thought of cancer : that it had the volition of a killer . And he spoke of it like that until Maxine said , There was nothing you could do . It took five men and a woman to lift it . ' They were sitting in the backyard , their lawn chairs touching , and Maxine was holding his hand . The children were playing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened , told them Daddy had been through the worst day of his life , and t hev must leave him alone for a while . She kept his glass filled with gin and tonic and once , when ' Dina starred screaming in the front yard , he jumped out of the hair , but she grabbed his wrist and heldp92it tightly and said , It 's nothing , I 'll take care of it . ' She went around the house , and soon Tina stopped crying , and Maxine came back and said she 'd fallen down in the driveway and skinned her elbow . Art was trembling . Should n't you get some sedatives ? ' she said . He shook his head , then started to cry . Monday morning an answer  --  or at least a possibility  --  was waiting for him , as though it had actually chosen to enter his mind now , with the buzzing of the alarm clock . He got up quickly and stood in a shaft of sunlight on the floor . Maxine had rolled away from the clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moccasins and went downstairs and then outside and down the road toward the brook . He wanted to run but he kept walking . Before reaching the Whitfords ' house , he crossed to the opposite side of the road . Back in the trees , their house was shadowed and quiet . He walked all the way to the bridge before he stopped and looked up at the red house . Then he saw it , and he did n't know ( and would never know ) whether he had seen it yesterday , too , as he ran to the door or if he just thought he had seen it . But it was there : a bright green garden hose , coiled in the sunlight beside the house . He walked home . He went to the side yard where his own hose had lain all winter , screwed to the faucet . He stood looking at it , and then he went inside and quietly climbed the stairs , into the sounds of breathing , and got his pocketknife . Now he moved faster , down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the hose and cut it off . Farther down , he cut the hose again . He put his knife away and then stuck one end of the short piece of hose into his mouth , pressed his nostrils between two fingers , and breathed . He looked up through a bare maple tree at the sky . Then he walked around the house to the Buick and opened the trunk . His fingers were trembling as he lowered the piece of hose and placed it beside his first-aid kit , in front of a bucket of sand and a small snow shovel he had carried all through the winter.  |p93In  My LifeI had my hair in curlers all afternoon the daythey electrocuted Sonny Broussard . Orthe day before , I guess , because they did itat midnight . That seems in a way a strange time to do it , but when you think about it , it starts to make sense . Better for it to happen at night . At least I think I would n't want it first thing in the morning , staying awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell window and it waiting for me ; I think I 'd rather wait all day and see the sun set and the dark come and know now in the night I was going . But maybe that 's only because I work nights and do n't like mornings . His real name was Willard , he was big , and sometimes I still remember his weight on top of me and his smell of booze and nigger . I bet you liked it , ' Charlie said once . I bet you twitched a little . ' Shit . I was dry as a cracker . I just lay there and watched him with my legs like this and I was saying to myself Dear Jesus because I thought when he finished he 'd cut my throat and that 's why I would n't even shut my eyes . ' ' Did n't he say nothing , all that time ? ' There . He said There when he finished . He said it twice . When he was leaving he stumbled , he was still pulling up his pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be one over there on the dresser , a little lamp I had  --  and it broke and he started running . That 's when I stopped being so scared and I wanted to kill him and I called the sheriff . ' Charlie is married . It semis after you get to be twenty-five there 's nothing around but married men . I was married when I was eighteen , we had to , hut I miscarried , : Ind inside of two cars I could n't stand the sight of him . His name seas Unlink ' , and I carne to hate that name , and I would pronounce it hating . I 'd say , Okay ,  |p94Brumby  . ' One morning I woke up and he was gone . I went in the kitchen and there was a note on the table , with the salt shaker resting on it . I was grinning when I picked it up . It said : I 'm sorry , I 'll send money . Brumby . I laughed , I was so glad he finally took it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little frost in my insides , listening to the quiet in the house . Then I turned on the radio and put water on for coffee . While it was dripping I took a shower , humming . I went naked to the kitchen , it was summer and already the morning getting hot ; a mama blue jay was making a racket in the fig tree . I got a cup of coffee and a cigarette and turned up the radio so I could hear it in the bathroom and went back and made up my face . The radio was playing hillbilly . I took a long time with my face , I felt good and free , and I prayed : Thank you sweet Jesus , do n't let him change his mind . He left me the car . That afternoon I went to town and bought a yellow dress at Penney 's ; when I got home I put it on and drove up the little white shell road through the pines to the highway . The Bons Temps was a mile down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a cocktail waitress and Mr. Breaux hired me because I 'm pretty . Brumby sent me a money order for fifty dollars and asked if I was going to divorce him , and when I got around to it , I did . The only time I ever missed him was around dusk and I knew it was n't really him I missed . The sun would go down and I 'd have the lights but it was n't the same . But I was lucky : I 'd be fixing supperabout that time and getting dressed and made up for work . I 'm glad I do n't work in the day , especially in winter when it gets dark early . If I worked in the daytime I 'd leave a light on when I left in the morning so it 'd be there to come home to . We have Blue Law in our parish , so sometimes on Sunday afternoons I go see my sister and her husband in Opelousas or go to a movie and I always turn some lights on first , the overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room . On a good sunny day I ca n't even tell they 're on , the sun comes in so bright in those rooms . They took a long time getting around to killing Sonny , almost sixteen months after he walked in the front door ( I keep them locked now and I have a dog that barks at niggers walking past on the road and a pistol that I at least know how it works ) and did what he pleased and stumbled out drunk . So I had a lot of time to get over him ; or it . Everybody at the Bons Temps was nice to me while it was still in the papers . Then I had my period . Then Earlp95came along : he was married , he was a postman , and on Friday and Saturday nights he played electric guitar in the hillbilly hand at the Bons Temps . I 'd say Earl saved me in a way . I still felt different , like I had sores or something , and I thought Sonny- Broussard being a nigger would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl came home for a cup of coffee with me and everything was all right . I woke up wondering if he still felt the same in the morning . He could n't get out on week nights , so I did n't see him till Friday and as soon as he grinned I knew it was okay . So it was every Friday and Saturday nights for a couple of months , and I 'd watch him get up and dress fast in the cold . In the morning I 'd wake up late and lie there smoking and looking out at the frost on the grass that was left , and the brown earth , and beyond that the pines in the sun . Or some mornings it was doing that slow cold rain and I did n't want to get up and light the heaters , it was so cold , and I 'd stay in bed a long time till I felt like the quiet was going to explode ; then I 'd get up and soon the bacon was sizzling and smelling . Then his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a hateful woman for carrying on with her man ; the letter came to the Bons Temps and Iread it thinking , Her man ? TVhy it was n't even him , it was just a couple of times a week , about four hours all told . But that was theend of it with Earl ; his wife was waiting up for him . But I was all right then , Earl had taken care of me . There was Vern between Earl and Charlie , while Sonny Broussardwas waiting , and most of the time I did n't think about him ; but sometimes I did and I wished it had come out at the trial that he had done other things too , robbery or maybe an old knifing , but he had n't . It was just that one thing with me and I had called the sheriff , I had wanted him dead when he knocked over the lamp and ran ; I wanted him dead when the sheriff and a deputy came , then went up the shell road way back up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead when they caught him that same afternoon in Port Arthur , Texas ; and I wanted him dead when I saw him in the courthouse . But when they said they would do it I felt funny , sort of like surprised , and scared too . Then , like I say , t here was Earl and he did n't mind ; and the trucker Vern that came bonne on a Friday night and staved with me all day till time for awn l : Saturday , then he WAS on the road again ; I have n't seen him since but some day I hope to . Charlie is good to mc , though . He 's a hid rough man and it does n't natter if his wife waits up for him orp96not , he 'll tell her it 's none of her business where he 's been . Once he staved until the sun was coming up , and there were shadows from the pines . They killed Sonnv Broussard on a Thursday in March . In late afternoon I took my curlers out real slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights and put the rice on and played the radio ; while I was brushing my hair I tried to picture him in the prison , they probably had every corner lighted up , and I wondered was he eating supper . I do n't care about niggers one way or the other . I hated his smell and his black and his booze breath and him in me , I hated his panting and grunting over my face , and his big hands pressing mine back on the pillow . I 'd never go with one on purpose . His lawyer was n't much older than me , already getting sloppy fat and with a crewcut . He asked if I put up a fight ; I said not much , I was scared he 'd kill me . That was all he asked me about that . He mostly tried to show Sonny Broussard had a clean record and that night he was dead drunk . Brushing my hair at the bathroom mirror I thought myself pretty and I wondered how long I 'd be pretty , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they go , and I wonder if it 's like that to get old , if the time will come when I dye it black over the gray and if I wo n't be able to remember that Vern 's last name was Mackey and that I knew him between Earl and Charlie in the winter of nineteen fifty-six . Then I thought about Sonny Broussardstanding there when I woke up with my heart pounding and he dropped his pants and pulled hack the sheet and spread my legs like parting canes in a canebrake and I was so dry but still he done it fast , maybe a couple of minutes like Charlie is first time around , then him saying There . There . I thought maybe I could tell Charlie . But for a long time he was n't at the Bons Temps that night ; even for a Thursday there was n't much of a crowd , not even enough people to change the air , so at eleven o'clock I could still smell the dance wax . I kept looking at the door and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got worse , I always had a cigarette going in my ash tray at the bar . Then about eleven thirty-five I was serving a table of four , my tray was wet and the quarters and nickels sticking , but still thislow was prying up every one of them until his pressing on the tray made it hard to hold . ' When he had the last nickel , Charlie behind me said : ' Jill . '  |p97I  spun around and almost grabbed him . He was bigger in his mackinaw , a big broad face with thick reddish hair . I thought you would n't come . ' Hell yeah , ' he said . He was grinning . Then for a while I talked to Charlie at the bar and waited table ; I was still nervous but happy too because he 'd be with me that night . I looked at the clock at five minutes to twelve while I was waiting for Curtis to mix a Vodka Collins and open three beers . Then I brought them to the table . The juke box had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams songs . It said one minute , and Hank was singing . I looked at the maybe twenty faces scattered about at the tables , there were some men together but mostly couples , older than me , and I watched their cigarettes and their hands and faces . I thought Sweet Jesus . Ithought I have felt his body and now they are going to burn it . Then I thought No . Then I said it out loud , No , ' and it was midnight . We got home at one-fifteen and went into the kitchen that was lighted up . This time I did n't put on coffee , I said I 'd drink with him a little , and I took from the cupboard the bourbon he kept there for his time with me . He was being careful , he was n't sure how to treat me , he had n't known tonight was the night until I went fast from the dance floor and stood beside him sitting so big on the bar stool and I put my face on his arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he made us some drinks , we had one in the kitchen , the next one in bed , naked under the covers , but I still was n't sure I wanted to do anything . We were on our sides , looking at one another , propped on our elbows so we could drink . It was just a couple of minutes , ' I said . That he was in me . ' Yes . ' He was watching me , and I thought for a second how good it was that he was relaxed , not like Earl , he never hurried to leave . If they shot him that morning , ' I said . Or if you 'd known me then and you 'd dragged him out of his shack and beat him up . ' I would 've . ' Do you want another drink ? ' Nape . ' Could we just lav here a while ? ' Sure . ' He put our glasses on t he hcdtiidc t able and lay on his back withp98one arm out for me and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side so all of me was snug against him . Can you wait a while ? ' I said . There 's other nights coming . ' I 've had eleven , ' I said . I do n't count him . ' You 're off to a good start . ' One knocked me up and he was a slob , ' I said . Pretty soon I fell asleep . A long time later he woke me up and I said yes I wanted to . Over his shoulder there was pale light at the window.  |p99If  They Knew Yvonneto Andre and JebI grew up in Louisiana , and for twelve yearsI went to a boys ' school taught by ChristianBrothers , a Catholic religious order . In the eighth grade our teacher was Brother Thomas . I still have a picture he gave to each boy in the class at the end of that year ; it 's a picture of Thomas Aquinas , two angels , and a woman . In the left foreground Aquinas is seated , leaning back against one angel whose hands grip his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds , and his upturned face looks imploringly at the angel . The second angel is kneeling at his feet and , with both hands , is tightening a sash around Aquinas 's waist . In the left background of the picture , the woman is escapingup a flight of stone stairs ; her face is turned backward for a final look before she bolts from the room . According to Brother Thomas , some of Aquinas 's family were against his becoming a priest , so they sent a woman to his room . He drove her out , then angels descended , encircled his waist with a cord , and squeezed all concupiscence from his body so he would never be tempted again . On the back of the picture , under the title Angelic Warfare , is a prayer for purity . Brother Thomas was the first teacher who named for us the sins included in the Sixth and Ninth Commandments which , in the Catholic recording of the Decalogue , forbid adultery and coveting your neighbor 's wife . In an introductory way , he simply listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most signiticant : he called it self-abuse and , quickly sweeping our faces , he saw that we understood . It was a mortal sin , he said , because first of all it wasted the precious seed which God had given us for marriage.  |p100Also  , sexual pleasure was reserved for married people alone , to have children by performing the marriage act . Self-abuse was not even a natural act ; it was unnatural , and if a boy did it he was no better than a monkey . It was a desecration of our bodies , which were temples of the Holy Ghost , a mortal sin that resulted in the loss of sanctifying grace and therefore could send us to hell . He walked a few paces from his desk , his legs hidden by the long black robe , then he went back and stood behind the desk again and pulled down on his white collar : the front of it hung straight down from his throat like two white and faceless playing cards . Avoid being alone , ' he said . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the house  --  go out and play ball , or cut the grass , or wash your dad 's car . Do anything , but use up your energy . And pray to the Blessed Mother : take your rosary to bed at night and say it while you 're going to sleep . If you fall asleep before you finish , the Blessed Mother wo n't mind  --  that 's what she wants you to do . ' Then he urged us to receive the Holy Eucharist often . He told us of the benefits gained through the Eucharist : sanctifying grace , which helped us fight temptation ; release from the temporal punishmentof purgatory ; and therefore , until we committed another mortal or venial sin , a guarantee of immediate entrance into heaven . He hoped and prayed , he said , that he would die with the Holy Eucharist on his tongue . He had been talking with the excited voice yet wandering eyes of a man repeating by rote what he truly believes . But now his eyes focused on something out the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dusty school ground of that hot spring day . One hand rose to scratch his jaw . In a way , ' he said softly , you 'd actually be doing someone a favor if you killed him when he had just received the Eucharist . ' I made it until midsummer , about two weeks short of my fourteenthbirthday . I actually believed I would make it forever . Then one hot summer night when my parents were out playing bridge , Janet was on a date , and I was alone in the house , looking at Holidaymagazine  --  girls in advertisements drinking rum or lighting cigarettes , girls in bulky sweaters at ski resorts , girls at beaches . girls on horseback  --  I went to the bathroom , telling myself I was only going to piss , lingering there , thinking it was pain I felt but then I knew it was n't , that for the first wakeful time in my life itp101was about to happen , then it did , and I stood weak and trembling and , shutting my eyes , saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas , then above them , descending to join them , the awful diaphanous bulk of God . That was a Tuesday . I set the alarm clock and woke next morning at six-thirty , feeling that everyone on earth and in heaven had watched my sin , and had been watching me as I slept . I dressed quickly and crept past Janet 's bedroom ; she slept on her side , one sun-dark arm on top of the sheet ; then past the closed door of my parents ' room and out of the house . Riding my bicycle down the driveway I thought of being struck by a car , so I rode on the sidewalk to church and I got there in time for confession before Mass . When I got home Janet was sitting on the front steps , drinking orange juice . I rode across the lawn and stopped in front of her and looked at her smooth brown legs . Where 'd you go ? ' ' To Mass . ' Special day today ? ' I woke up , ' I said . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered Brother Thomas quotingsome saint who had said if you could n't stand an insect buzzing at your ear while you were trying to sleep , how could you stand the eternal punishment of hell ? ' You set the alarm , ' she said . I heard it . ' Then Mother called us in to breakfast . She asked where I had been , then said : Well , that 's nice . Maybe you 'll be a priest . ' Ha , ' Daddy said . Do n't worry , Daddy , ' Janet said . We do n't hate Episcopalians anymore . ' I got through two more days , until Friday , then Saturday afternoonI had to go to confession again . Through the veil over the latticed window Father Broussard told me to pray often to the VirginMary , to avoid those people and places and things that were occasions of sin , to go to confession and receive Communion at least once a week . The tone of his whispering voice was kind , and t he confessional itself was constructed to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its interior was dark as my soul was , and Christ crucified stared back at me , inches from my face . lather Broussard told me to say , ten Our Fathers and ten Hail Marys for ntv penance . I said them kneeling in a pew at the rear , then 1 went outside and walked around the church to the cemetery . In hotp102sun I moved among old graves and took out my rosary and began to pray . Sunday we went to eleven o'clock Mass . Janet and I received Communion , but Mother had eaten toast and coffee , breaking her fast , so she did n't receive . Most Sundays she broke her fast because we went to late Mass , and in those days you had to fast from midnightuntil you received Communion ; around ten in the morning she would feel faint and have to eat something . After Mass , Janet started the car and lit a cigarette and waited for our line in the parkinglot to move . I envied her nerve . She was only sixteen , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just ca n't keep the fast , ' Mother said . I must need vitamins . ' She was sitting in the front seat , opening and closing her black fan . Maybe you do , ' Janet said . Maybe so . If you have to smoke , I wish you 'd do it at home . ' Janet smiled and drove in first gear out of the parking lot . Her window was down and on the way home I watched her dark hair blowing in the breeze . That was how my fourteenth summer passed : baseball in the mornings , and friends and movies and some days of peace , of hope  --  then back to the confessional where the smell of sweat hung in the air like spewed-out sin . Once I saw the student body president walking down the main street ; he recognized my face and told me hello , and I blushed not with timidity but shame , for he walked with a confident stride , he was strong and good while I was weak . A high school girl down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour after I had done it , and I sat against the door at my side and could not look at her ; I answered her in a low voice and said nothing on my own and I knew she thought I was shy , but that was better than the truth , for I believed if she knew what sat next to her she would recoil in disgust . When fall came I was lad , for I hoped the school days would break the pattern of my sins . But I was also afraid the Brothers could see the summer in my eyes ; then it was n't just summer , but fall and winter too , for the pattern was n't broken and I could not stop . In the confessional the hardest priest was an old Dutchman who scolded and talked about manliness and will power and once told me to stick my finger in the flame of a candle , then imagine the eternal fire of hell . I did n't do it . Father Broussard was firm , sometimesimpatient , but easy compared to the Dutchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said very little : I doubt if he ever spoke to me for over thirty seconds , and he gave such light penances  --  three or four Hail Marys  --  that I began to think he could n't understand English well enough to know what I told him . Then it was fall again , I was fifteen , and Janet was a freshman at the college in town . She was dating Bob Mitchell , a Yankee from Michigan . He was an airman from the SAC Base , so she had to arguewith Mother for the first week or so . He was a high school graduate , intelligent , and he planned to go to the University of Michigan when he got out . That 's what she told Mother , who believeda man in uniform was less trustworthy than a local civilian . One weekend in October Mother and Daddy went to Baton Rouge to see L.S.U. play Ole Miss . It was a night game and they were goingto spend Saturday night with friends in Baton Rouge . They left after lunch Saturday and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke their date , then went to bed . She had the flu , she said , but she had n't told them because Mother would have felt it was her duty to stay home . Would you bring me a beer ? ' she said . ' I ' 11 just lie in bed and drink beer and you wo n't have to bother with me at all . ' I sat in the living room and listened to Bill Stern broadcast Notre Dame and S.M.U. I kept checking on Janet to see if she wanted another beer ; she 'd smile at me over her book  --  The Idiot  --  then shake her beer can and say yes . When the game was over I told her I was going to confession and she gave me some money for cigarettes . I had enough to be ashamed of without people thinking I smoked too . When I got home I told her I had forgotten . Would you see if Daddy left any ? ' I went into their room . On the wall above the double bed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it a graven image , but he smiled when he said it ) ; stuck behind the crucifix was a blade from a palm frond , dried brown and crisp since Palm Sunday . I opened the top drawer of Daddy 's bureau and took out the carton of Luckies . Then something else red-and-white caught my eye : the corner of a small box under his rolled-up socks . For a moment I did n't take it out . I stood looking at that corner of cardboard , knowing immediately what it was and also knowing that I was n't learning anv thing new , that I had known for some indefinite and secret time , maybe a few months or a year or even two years . I stood there in the history of my knowledge , then I put down thep104cigarette carton and took the box of condoms from the drawer . I had slid the cover off the box and was looking at the vertically arrangedrolled condoms when I heard the bedsprings , but it was too late , her bare feet were already crossing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to her as she said : Ca n't you find  --  ' then stopped . At first she blushed , but only for a second or two . She came into the room , gently took the box from me , put the cover on , and looked at it for a moment . Then she put it in the drawer , covered it with socks , got a pack of cigarettes , and started back to her room . Why do n't you bring me a beer , ' she said over her shoulder . And we 'll have a little talk . ' When I brought the beer she was propped up in bed , and The Idiot was closed on the bedside table . Are you really surprised ? ' she said . I shook my head . Does it bother you ? ' Yes . ' You 're probably scrupulous . You confess enough for Eichmann , you know . ' I blushed and looked away . Do you know that some people  --  theologians -- believe a mortal sin is as rare as a capital crime ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' They must not be Catholics . ' Some of them are . Listen : Mother 's only mistake is she thinks it 's a sin , so she does n't receive Communion . And I guess that 's why she does n't get a diaphragm  --  that would be too committed . ' This sort of talk scared me , and I was relieved when she stopped . She told me not to worry about Mother and especially not to blame Daddy , not to think of him as a Protestant who had led Mother away from the Church . She said the Church was wrong . Several times she used the word love , and that night in bed I thought : love ? love ? For all I could think of was semen and I rememberedlong ago a condom lying in the dust of a country road ; a line of black ants was crawling into it . I got out of bed , turned on a lamp , and read the Angelic Warfare prayer , which ends like this : 0 God , Who has vouchsafed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are engaged in the terrible conflict of chastity ! grant to us Thy suppliants , by his help , happily to overcome in this warfare the terrible enemy of our body and souls , that , beingp105crowned with the lily of perpetual purity , we may deserve to receivefrom Thee , amongst the chaste bands of the angels , the palm of bliss .... Janet did n't do so well in the war . That January she and Bob Mitchell drove to Port Arthur , Texas , and got married by a justice of the peace . Then they went to Father Broussard for a Catholic marriage , but when he found out Janet was pregnant he refused . He said he did n't think this marriage would last , and he would not make it permanent in the eyes of God . My parents and I knew nothing of this until a couple of weeks later , when Bob was dischargedfrom the Air Force . One night they told us , and two days later Janet was gone , up to Michigan ; she wrote that although Bob was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this time a priest had married them . Seven months after the Texas wedding she had twin sons and Mother went up there on the bus and staved two weeks and sent us postcards from Ann Arbor . You get over your sister 's troubles , even images of her getting pregnant in a parked car , just as after a while you stop worrying about whether or not your mother is living in sin . I had my own troubles and one summer afternoon when I was sixteen , alone in the house , having done it again after receiving Communion that very morning , I lay across my bed , crying and striking my head with my fist . It was a weekday , so the priests were n't hearing confessionsuntil next morning before Mass . I could have gone to the rectory and confessed to a priest in his office , but I could not do that , I had to have the veiled window between our faces . Finally I got up and went to the phone in the hall . I dialed the rectory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get to church but I had to confess and I wanted to do it right now , on the phone . I barely heard the suspicious turn in his voice when he told me to come to the rectory . I ca n't , ' I said . What about tomorrow ? Could you come tomorrow before Mass , or during the day ? ' I ca n't , Father . I ca n't wait that long . ' Who is this ? ' For a moment we were both quiet . Then I said : That 's all right . ' It was an expression we boys used , and it usually meant none of our business . I had said it in a near-whisper , not sure if I couldspeak another word without crying.  |p106All  right , ' he said , let me hear your confession . ' I kneeled on the floor , my eyes closed , the telephone cord stretched tautly to its full length : Bless me Father , for I have sinned ; my last confession was yesterday  --  ' now I was crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed ; I could still talk but my voice was in shards  --  my sins are : I committed self-abuse one time  --  ' the word time trailing off , whisperedinto the phone and the empty hall which grew emptier still , for Father Broussard said nothing and I kneeled with eyes shut tight and the receiver hurting my hot ear until finally he said : All right , but I ca n't give you absolution over the phone . Will you come to the rectory at about three ? ' Yes , Father . ' And ask for Father Broussard . ' Yes , Father , thank you , Father  --  ' still holding the receiver after he hung up , my eyes shut on black and red shame ; then I stood weakly and returned to the bed  --  I would not go to the rectory  --  and lay there feeling I was the only person alive on this humid summerday . I could not stop crying , and I began striking my head again . I spoke aloud to God , begging him to forgive me , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy . Then something occurred to me : an image tossed up for my consideration , looked at , repudiated  --  all in an instant while my fist was poised . I saw myself sitting on the bed , trousers dropped to the floor , my sharpedgedhunting knife in my right hand , then with one quick determinedslash cutting off that autonomous penis and casting it on the floor to shrivel and die . But before my fist struck again I threw that image away . No voices told me why . I had no warning vision of pain , of bleeding to death , of being an impotent freak . I simply knew ; it is there between your legs and you do not cut it off . YVONNE Millet finally put it to good use . We were both nineteen , both virgins ; we started dating the summer after ourfreshman year at the college in town . She was slender , with black hair cut short in what they called an Italian Boy . She was a Catholic , and had been taught by nuns for twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was . In thep107parked car we soaked our clothes with sweat , and sometimes I went home with spotted trousers which I rolled into a bundle and dropped in the basket for dry cleaning . I confessed this and petting too , and tried on our dates to keep dry , so that many nights I crawled aching and nauseated into my bed at home . I lay very still in my pain , feeling quasi-victorious : I believed Yvonne and I were committing mortal sins by merely touching each other , but at least for another night we had resisted the graver sin of orgasm . On other nights she took me with her hand or we rubbed against each other in a clothed pantomine of lovemaking until we came . This happenedoften enough so that for the first time in nearly seven years I stopped masturbating . And Saturday after Saturday I went proudly to confession and told of my sins with Yvonne . I confessed to Father Grassi , who still did n't talk much , but one Saturday afternoon he said : How old are you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the young girl ? ' I told him she was nineteen . Now I was worried : I had avoided confessing to Father Broussard or the Dutchman because I was afraid one of them would ask about the frequency of our sins , then tell me either to be pure or break up with her and , if I did neither of these , I could not be absolved again . I had thought Father Grassi would not ask questions . Do you love her ? ' Yes , Father . ' At your age I think it is very hard to know if you really love someone . So I recommend that you and your girl think about gettingmarried in two or three years ' time and then , my friend , until you are ready for a short engagement and then marriage , I think each of you should go out with other people . Mostly with each other , of course , but with other people too . That may not help you to stay pure , but at least it will help you know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Because this other thing that 's going on now , that 's not love , you see . So you should test it in other ways . ' I told him I understood and I would talk to my girl about it . I never did , though . Once in a while Yvonne confessed but I have no idea what she told the priest , for she did not sec things the way I saW them . One night , When I tried to stop us short , she pulled my hand hack to its proper place and held it there until she was readyp108for it to leave . Then she reached to the dashboard for a cigarette , tapped it , and paused as though remembering to offer me one . Do n't you want me to do it for you ? ' she said . No , I 'm all right . ' She smoked for a while , her head on my shoulder . Do you really think it 's a worse sin when it happens to you ? ' she said . Yes . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taught me . You believe that ? ' she said . That God gave you this seed just to have babies with , and if you waste it He 'll send you to hell ? ' I guess so . ' You have wet dreams , do n't you ? ' That 's different . There 's no will involved . ' What about me ? It just happened to me , and I did n't use up any eggs or anything , so where 's my sin ? ' I do n't know . Maybe sins are different for girls . ' Then it would n't be a sin for me to masturbate either . Right ? I do n't , but is n't that true ? ' I never thought of that . ' Well , do n't . You think too much already . ' Maybe you do n't think enough . ' You 're right : I do n't . ' ' I ' 11 tell you why it 's a sin , ' I said . Because it 's reserved for marriedpeople . ' Climax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be married to touch each other too , ' she said . So why draw the line at climax ? I mean , why get all worked up and then stop and think that 's good ? ' You 're right . We should n't do any of it . ' Oh , I 'm not sure it 's as bad as all that . ' You 're not ? You do n't think it 's a sin , what we do ? ' Maybe a little , but it 's not as bad as a lot of other things . ' It 's a mortal sin . ' I do n't think so . I believe it 's a sin to talk about a girl , but I do n't think what you do with her is so bad . ' All right : if that 's what you think , why do n't we just go all the way ? '  |p109She  sat up to throw her cigarette out the window , then she nestled her face on my chest . Because I 'm scared , ' she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . I 'm just scared of not being a virgin , that 's all . ' Then she finished our argument , won it , soaked her small handkerchief in my casuistry . Next morning at breakfast I was tired . You 're going to ruin your health , ' Mother said . It was after one when you got home . ' I flexed my bicep and said I was fine . But now Daddy was watching me from his end of the table . I do n't care about your health , ' he said . I just hope you know more than Janet did . ' Honey , ' Mother said . She got it reversed . She started babies before she was married , then quit . ' That was true . Her twin boys were four now , and there were no other children . Bob had finished his undergraduate work and was going to start work on a Ph.D . in political science . Early in the summer Mother had gone up there and staved two weeks . When she got back and talked about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lie , and a couple of times I walked into the kitchen where Mother and Daddy were talking and they stopped until I had got what I wanted and left . I wo n't get pregnant , ' I said . Neither will Yvonne , ' Daddy said . As long as you keep your pants on . ' Then finally one night in early fall we drove away from her house , where we had parked for some time , and I knew she would not stop me , because by leaving her house she was risking questions from her parents , and by accepting that she was accepting the other risk too . I drove out to a country road , over a vibrating wooden bridge , the bayou beneath us dark as earth on that moonless night , on through black trees until I found a dirt road into the woods , keeping my hand on her small breast as I turned and cut off the ignitionand headlights . In a moment she was naked on the car seat , then I was out of my clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shockingly white bodt I almost dressed and took her home but then she said : Love me , Harry , love me/The Brothers had n't prepared me for this . If my first time had been with a whore , their training probably would have worked , for that was the sort of lust they focused on . But they were no match for Yvonne , and next morning I woke happier than I had ever been . At school that day we drank coffee and held hands and whispered . That night on the way to her house I stopped at a servicestation and bought a package of condoms from a machine in the men 's room . That was the only time I felt guilty . But I was at least perceptive enough to know why : condoms , like masturbation and whores , were something the Brothers knew about . I left that piss-smelling room , walked into the clear autumn night , and drove to Yvonne 's , where they had never been . For the rest of the fall and a few weeks of winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my own joy , my lack of remorse . Once , after a few weeks , I asked her if she ever felt bad . It was late at night and we were sitting at a bar , eating oysters on the halfshell . For a moment she did n't know what I meant , then she smiled . I feel wonderful , ' she said . She dipped her last oyster in the sauce , and leaned over the tray to eat it . Do we have enough money for more ? ' she said . Sure . ' They were ninety cents a dozen . We watched the Negro open them , and I felt fine , eating oysters and drinking beer at one in the morning , having made love an hour ago to this pretty girl beside me . I looked at her hair and wondered if she ought to let it grow . Sometimes I worry though , ' she said . Getting pregnant ? ' Nope , I never said you had to use those things . I worry about you . ' Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much , and now you do n't . ' That 's because I love you . ' She licked the red sauce from her fingers , then took my hand , squeezed it , and drank some beer . I 'm afraid someday you 'll start feeling bad again , then you 'll hate me . ' She was right to look for defeat in that direction , to expect me to move along cliched routes . But , as it turned out , it was n't guiltp111that finally soured us . After a couple of months I simply began noticingthings . I saw that she did n't really like football . She only enjoyed the games because they gave her a chance to dress up , and there was a band , and a crowd of students , and it was fun to keep a flask hidden while you poured bourbon into a paper cup . She cheered with the rest of us , but she was n't cheering for the same thing . She cheered because we were there , and a young man had run very fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end chasing a long pass : when he dived for it , caught it , and skidded on the ground , she turned happily to me and brushed her candied apple against my sleeve . Watch out , I said . She spit on her handkerchief and rubbed the sticky wool . She loved sweets , always asked me to buy her Mounds or Hershevs at the movies , and once in a while she 'd get a pimple which she tried to conceal with powder . I felt loose flesh at her waist when we danced , and walking beside her on the campusone afternoon I looked down and saw her belly pushing against her tight skirt ; I lightly backhanded it and told her to suck her gut in . She stood at attention , saluted , then gave me the finger . I 'm about to start my period , she said . Except for the soft flesh at her waist she was rather thin , and when she lay on her back her naked breasts spread and flattened , as though they were melting . Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives in Houston , leaving Yvonne to take care of her sister and brother , who were fourteen and eleven . They left Saturday morning , and that night Yvonne cooked for me . She was dressed up , black cocktail dress , even heels , and she was disappointed when she saw I had n't worn a coat . But she did n't say anything . She had alreadyfed her brother and sister , and they were in the den at the back of the house , watching television . Yvonne had a good fire in the living room fireplace , and on the coffee table she had bourbon , a pitcher of water , a bucket of ice , and a sugar bowl . Like they do in Faulkner , ' she said , and we sat on the couch and drank a couple of toddies before dinner . Then she left me for a while and I looked into the fire , hungry and horny , and wondered what time the brother and sister would go to bed and if Yvonne would do it while they were sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blushed , and said : If you 're brave enough , I am . Want to try it ? '  |p112We  ate by candlelight : oyster cocktails , then a roast with rice and thick dark gravy , garlic-tinged . We had lemon ice-box pie and went back to the fireplace with second cups of coffee . I love to cook , ' she said from the record player . She put on about five albums , and I saw that we were supposed to sit at the fire and talk for the rest of the evening . The first album was Jackie Gleason , Music , Martinis , and Memories , and she sat beside me , took my hand and sipped her coffee . She rested her head on the back of the couch , but I did n't like to handle a coffee cup leaning back that way , so I withdrew my hand from hers and hunched forward over the coffee table . I think I started cooking when I was seven , ' she said to my back . No , let 's see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed legs , the black dress just covering her knees , then looked at the fire . When we lived in Baton Rouge . I had a children 's cookbook and I made something called Chili Concoction . Everybody was nice about it , and Daddy ate two helpings for supper and told me to save the rest for breakfast and he 'd eat it with eggs . He did , too . Then I made something called a strawberry minute pie , and I think it was pretty good . I 'll make it for you some time . ' Okay . ' I was still hunched over drinking coffee , so I was n't looking at her . I finished the coffee and she asked if I wanted more , and that irritated me , so I did n't know whether to say yes or no . I said I guess so . Then watching her leave with my cup , I disliked myself and her too . For if I was n't worthy of the evening , then was n't she stupid and annoyingly vulnerable to give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished my coffee , then leaned back so our shoulders touched , our hands together in her lap , and we listened . Once she took a drag from my cigarette and I said keep it , and lit another . The third album was Brubeck . She put some more ice in the bucket , I made toddies , and she asked if I understood The Bear . I shrugged and said probably not . She had finished it the day before , and she started talking about it . Hey , ' I said . When are they going to sleep ? ' She was surprised , and again I disliked myself and her too . Then she was hurt , and she looked at her lap and said she did n't know , but she could n't make love anyway , not here in the house , even if they were sleeping . We can leave for a while , ' I said . We wo n't go far . ' She kept looking at her lap , at our clasped hands.  |p113They  'll be all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I looked away and she said : Okay , I 'll tell them . ' When she came back with a coat over her arm I was waiting at the door , my jacket zipped , the car key in my hand . We broke up in January , about a week after New Year 's . I do n't recall whether we fought , or kissed goodbye , or sat in a car staring mutely out the windows . But I do remember when the end started ; or , rather , when Yvonne decided to recognize it . On New Year 's Eve a friend of ours gave a party . His parents were out of town , so everyone got drunk . It was an opportunity you felt obliged not to pass up . Two or three girls got sick and had to have their faces washed and be walked outside in the cold air . When Yvonne got drunk it was a pleasant drunk , and I took her upstairs . I think no one noticed : it was past midnight , and people were hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master bedroom , Yvonne with her skirt pulled up , her pants off , while I performed in shirt , sweater , and socks . She was quiet as we stood in the dark room , taking our pants off , and she did n't answer mywhispered Happy New Year as we began to make love , for the first time , on a bed . Then , moving beneath me , she said in a voice so incongruouswith her body that I almost softened but quickly got it hack , shutting my ears to what I had heard : This is all we ever do , Harry  --  this is all we ever do . The other thing I remember about that night is a time around three in the morning . A girl was cooking hamburgers , I was standing in the kitchen doorway talking to some boys , and Yvonne was sitting alone at the kitchen table . There were other people talking in the kitchen , but she was n't listening ; she moved only to tap ashes and draw on her cigarette , then exhaled into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty , quite lonely and sad , and I pitied her . But there was something else : I knew she would never make love to me again . Maybe that is why , as a last form of possession , I told . It could not have been more than an hour later , I was drunker , and in the bathroom I one-upped three friends who were bragging about feeling tits of drunken girls . I told them I had taken Yvonne upstairs and screwed her . To add history to it , I even told them what she had said.  |p114WAITING  in line for my first confessionin five months I felt someguilt but I was n't at all afraid . I onlyhad to confess sexual intercourse , and there was nothing shameful about that , nothing unnatural . It was a man 's sin . Father Broussard warned me never to see this girl again ( that 's what he called her : this girl ) , for a man is weak and he needs much grace to turn away from a girl who will give him her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious sin because sexual intercourse was given by God to married couples for the procreation of children and we had stolen it and used it wrongfully , for physical pleasure , which was its secondary purpose . I knew that in some way I had sinned , but Father Broussard 's definition of that sin fell short and did not sound at all like what I had done with Yvonne . So when I left the confessional I still felt unforgiven . The campus was not a very large one , but it was large enough so you could avoid seeing someone . I stopped going to the student center for coffee , and we had no classes together ; we only saw each other once in a while , usually from a distance , walking between buildings . We exchanged waves and the sort of smile you cut into your face at times like that . The town was small too , so occasionallyI saw her driving around , looking for a parking place or something . Then after a while I wanted to see her , and I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't drink coffee there anymore . In a week or so I realized that I did n't really want to see her : I wanted her to be happy , and if I saw her there was nothing I could say to help that . Soon I was back to the old private vice , though now it did n't seem a vice but an indulgence , not as serious as smoking or even drinking , closer to eating an ice cream sundae before bed every night . That was how I felt about it , like I had eaten two scoops of ice cream with thick hot fudge on it , and after a couple of bites it was n't good anymore but I finished it anyway , thinking of calories . It was a boring little performance and it did n't seem worth thinking about , one way or the other . But I told it in the confessional , so I could still receive the Eucharist . Then one day in spring I told the number of my sins as though I were telling the date of my birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quickly and sternly : Are you sorry for these sins ? ' Yes , Father , ' I said , but then I knew it was a lie . He was askingp115me if I had a firm resolve to avoid this sin in the future when I said : No , Father . ' No what ? You ca n't avoid it ? ' I mean no , Father , I 'm not really sorry . I do n't even think it 's a sin . ' Oh , I see . You do n't have the discipline to stop , so you 've decidedit 's not a sin . Just like that , you 've countermanded God 's law . Do you want absolution ? ' Yes , Father . I want to receive Communion . ' You ca n't . You 're living in mortal sin , and I can not absolve you while you keep this attitude . I want you to think very seriously  --  ' But I was n't listening . I was looking at the crucifix and waiting for his voice to stop so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do next . Then he stopped talking , and I said : Yes , Father . ' What ? ' he said . What ? ' I went quickly through the curtains , out of the confessional , out of the church . On Sundays I went to Mass but did not receive the Eucharist . I thought I could but I was afraid that as soon as the Host touched my tongue I would suddenly realize I had been wrong , and then I 'd be receiving Christ with mortal sin on my soul . Mother did n't receiveeither . I prayed for her and hoped she 'd soon have peace , even if it meant early menopause . By now I agreed with Janet , and I wished she 'd write Mother a letter and convince her that she was n't evil . I thought Mother was probably praying for Janet , who had gone five years without bearing a child . It was June , school was out , and I did not see Yvonne at all . I was working with a surveying crew , running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a machete , eating big lunches from paper bags , and waiting for something to happen . There were two alternatives , and I was n't phony enough for the first or brave enough for the second : I could start confessing again , the way I used to , or I could ignore the confessional and simply receive Communion . But nothing happened and each Sunday I stayed with Mother in the pew while the others went up to the altar rail . Then Janet came home . She wrote that Bob had left her , had moved in with his girlfriend  --  a graduate student  --  and she and the  |p116me  when I got home from work , Mother handing me the letter as I came through the front door , both of them watching me as I read it . Then Daddy cursed , Mother started crying again , and I took a beer out to the front porch . After a while Daddy came out too and we sat without talking and drank beer until Mother called us to supper . Daddy said , That son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time Janet and the boys rode the bus home from Ann Arbor , Mother was worried about something else : the Church , be- cause now Janet was twenty-three years old and getting a divorce and if she ever married again she was out of the Church . Unless Bob died , and Daddy said he did n't care what the Church thought about divorce , but it seemed a good enough reason for him to go up to Ann Arbor , Michigan , and shoot Bob Mitchell between the eyes . So while Janet and Paul and Lee were riding south on the Grey- hound , Mother was going to daily Mass and praying for some an- swer to Janet 's future . But Janet had already taken care of that too . When she got off the bus I knew she 'd be getting married again some day : she had gained about ten pounds , probably from all that cheap food while Bob went to school , but she had always been on the lean side any- way and now she looked better than I remembered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boys were five years old now , and I was glad she had n't had any more , because they seemed to be good little boys and not enough to scare off a man . We took them home  --  it was a Friday night  --  and Daddy gave Janet a tall drink of bourbon and everybody talked as though nothing had happened . Then we ate shrimp etou ff ee and after supper , when the boys were in bed and the rest of us were in the living room , Janet said by God it was the best meal she had had in five years , and next time she was going to marry a man who liked Louisiana cooking . When she saw the quick look in Mother 's eyes , she said : We did n't get married in the Church , Mama . I just told you we did so you would n't worry . ' You did n't ? ' Bob was so mad at Father Broussard he would n't try again . He 's not a Catholic , you know . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy said . ' So I can still get married in the Church , ' Janet said . To some- body else . ' But Janet  --  ' Wait , ' Daddy said . Wait . You 've been praying for days so Janet  |p117could  stop living with that son of a bitch and still save her soul . Now you got it  --  right ? ' But  --  ' Right ? ' Well , ' Mother said , I guess so . ' They went to bed about an hour past their usual time , but Janetand I staved up drinking gin and tonic in the kitchen , with the doorclosed so we would n't keep anybody awake . At first she just talkedabout how glad she was to be home , even if the first sign of it wasthe Negroes going to the hack of the bus . She loved this hot oldsticky night , she said , and the June bugs thumping against thescreen and she had forgotten how cigarettes get soft down here inthe humid air . Finally she talked about Bob ; she did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first year upthere , and it had gone on for five years more or less ; near the endshe had even done it too , had a boyfriend , but it did n't help her surviveat all , it only made things worse , and now at least she felt cleanand tough and she thought that was the first step toward hope . The stupid thing was she still loved the philandering son of abitch . That was the only time she cried , when she said that , but shedid n't even cry long enough for me to get up and go to her side ofthe table and hold her : when I was half out of my chair she was alreadywaving me back in it , shaking her head and wiping her eyes , and the tears that had filled them for a moment were gone . Thenshe cheered up and asked if I 'd drive her around tomorrow , downthe main street and everything , and I said sure and asked her if shewas still a Catholic . Do n't tell Mother this , ' she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communion every Sunday , except when I was havingthat stupid affair , and I only felt sinful then because he loved meand I was using him . But before that and after that , I received . ' You ca n't , ' I said . Not while you 're married out of the Church . ' Maybe I 'm wrong , but I do n't think the Church is so smart aboutsex . Bob would n't get the marriage blessed , so a priest would havetold me to leave him . I loved him , though , and for a long time Ithought he loved me , needed me  --  so I stayed with him and tried tokeep peace and bring up my sons . And the Eucharist is the sacramentof love and I needed it very badly those five years and nobodycan keep me away . ' I got up and took our glasses and made drinks . When I turnedfrom t he sink she was watching me.  |p118Do  you still go to confession so much ? ' she said . I sat down , avoiding her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell Janet you ca n't tell anybody . So looking at the screen door and the bugs thumping from the dark outside , I told her how it was in high school and about Yvonne , though I did n't tell her name , and my aborted confession to Father Broussard . She was kind to me , busying herself with cigarettes and her drink while I talked . Then she said : You 're right , Harry . You 're absolutely right . ' You really think so ? ' I know this much : too many of those celibates teach sex the way it is for them . They make it introverted , so you come out of their schools believing sex is something between you and yourself , or between you and God . Instead of between you and other people . Like my affair . It was n't wrong because I was married . Hell , Bob did n't care , in fact he was glad because it gave him more freedom . It was wrong because I hurt the guy . ' A Yankee word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that accent from up there among snow and lakes . If Bob had staved home and taken a Playboy to the bathroomonce in a while I might still have a husband . So if that 's a sin , I do n't understand sin . ' Well , ' I said . Then looking at her , I grinned and it kept spreading and turned into a laugh . You 're something , all right , ' I said . Old Janet , you 're something . ' But I still was n't the renegade Janet was , I wanted absolution from a priest , and next morning while Mother and Daddy were happily teasing us about our hangovers , I decided to get it done . That afternoon I called Father Grassi , then told Janet where I was going , and that I would drive her around town when I got back . Father Grassi answered the door at the rectory ; he was wearing a white shirt with his black trousers , a small man with a ruddy face and dark whiskers . I asked if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , ' he said . Do you come from the Pope ? ' No , Father . I just want to confess . ' So it 's you who will be the saint today , not me . Yes , come in . ' He led me to his office , put his stole around his neck , and sat in the swivel chair behind his desk ; I kneeled beside him on the carpet , and he shielded his face with his hand , as though we were in the confessionaland he could not see me . I whispered , Bless me Father , for I have sinned , ' my hands clasped at my waist , my head bowed . Myp119last confession was six weeks ago , but I was refused absolution . By Father Broussard . ' Is that so ? You do n't look like a very bad young man to me . Are you some kind of criminal ? ' I confessed masturbation , Father . ' Yes ? Then what ? ' I told him I did n't think it was a sin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be confused too , if you confessed something as a sin and then said you did n't think it was a sin . You should take better care of your priests , my friend . ' I opened my eyes : his hand was still in place on his cheek , and he was looking straight ahead , over his desk at the bookshelf against the wall . I guess so , ' I said . And now I 'm bothering you . ' Oh no : you 're no trouble . The only disappointment is you were n't sent by the Pope . But since that 's the way it is , then we may just as well talk about sins . We had in the seminary a book of moral theology and in that book , my friend , it was written that masturbationwas worse than rape , because at least rape was the carrying out of a natural instinct . What about that ? ' Do you believe that , Father ? ' Do you ? ' No , Father . ' Neither do I. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only for that reason . The book also said , among other things , let the buyer beware . So you tell me about sin and we 'll educate each other . ' I went to the Brothers ' school . ' Ah , yes . Nice fellows , those Brothers . ' Yes , Father . But I think they concentrated too much on the body . One 's own body , I mean . And back then I believed it all , and one day I even wanted to mutilate myself . Then last fall I had a girl . ' What does that mean , you had a girl ? You mean you were lovers ? ' Yes , Father . But I should n't have had a girl , because I believed my semen was the most important part of sex , so the first time I made love with her I was waiting for it , like my soul was listening for it  --  you see ? Because I would n't know how I felt about her until I knew how I felt about ejaculating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you want to mutilate yourself with a can opener , or maybe something worse ? ' I was happy , Father . ' Yes . ' So after that we were lovers . Or she was , but I was n't . I was just happy because I could ejaculate without hating myself , so I was still masturbating , you see , but with her  --  does that make sense ? ' Oh yes , my friend . I 've known that since I left the seminary . Alwaysthere is too much talk of self-abuse . You see , even the term is a bad one . Have you finished your confession ? ' I want to confess about the girl again , because when I confessed it before it was n't right . I made love to her without loving her and the last time I made love to her I told some boys about it . ' Yes . Anything else ? ' No , Father . ' Good . There is a line in St. John that I like very much . It is Christ praying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray that You take them out of the world , but that You keep them from evil . ' Do you understand that ? ' I think so , Father . ' Then for your penance , say alleluia three times . ' Next afternoon Janet and I took her boys crabbing . We had an ice chest of beer and we set it under the small pavilion at the center of the wharf , then I put out six crab lines , tying them to the guard rail . I remembered the summer before she got married Janet and I had gone crabbing , then cooked them for the family : we had a large pot of water on the stove and when the water was boiling I held the gunny sack of live crabs over it and they came falling out , splashing into the water ; they worked their claws , moved sluggishly , thendied . And Janet had said : I keep waiting for them to scream . It was a hot day , up in the nineties . Someone was water-skiing on the lake , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we had the wharf to ourselves , and we drank beer in the shade while Paul and Lee did the crabbing . They lost the first couple , so I left the pavilion and squatted at the next line . The boys flanked me , lying on their bellies and looking down where the line went into the dark water ; they had their shirts off , and their hot tan shoulders and arms brushed my legs . I gently pulled the line up until we saw a crab just below the surface , swimming and nibbling at the chunk of ham.  |p121Okay  , Lee . Put the net down in the water , then bring it up under him so you do n't knock him away . ' He lowered the pole and scooped the net slowly under the crab . I got him ! ' That 's it . You just have to go slow , that 's all . ' He stood and lifted the net and laid it on the wharf . Look how big , ' Paul said . He 's a good one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But they crouched over the net , watching the crab push his claws through . Poor little crab , ' Lee said . You 're going to die . ' Does it hurt ' em , Harry ? ' Paul said . I do n't know . ' It 'd hurt me , ' he said . I guess it does , for a second or two . ' How long 's a second ? ' Lee said . I pinched his arm . About like that . ' That 's not too long , ' he said . No . Put him in the sack now , and catch some more . ' I went back to my beer on the bench . Paul was still crouching over the crab , poking a finger at its back . Then Lee held open the gunny sack and Paul turned the net over and shook it and the crab fell in . Goodbye , big crab , ' he said . Goodbye , poor crab , ' Lee said . They went to another line . For a couple of hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their bare feet on the wharf and their voices as they told each crab goodbye . Sometimes one of them would stop and look across the water and pull at his pecker , and I remembered that day hot as this one when I was sixteen and I wanted to cut mine off . I reached deep under the ice and got a cold beer for Janet and I thought of Yvonne sitting at that kitchen table at three in the morning , tired , her lipstick worn off , her eyes fixed on a space between the people in the room . Then I looked at the boys Iving on their bellies and reaching down for another crab , and I hoped they would grow well , those strong little bodies , those kind hearts.  |p122Going  Underto HollyMIRANDA is wearing purple and waiting in the open doorway , behindher are the yellow walls of the livingroom and the orange couchwhere they have loved , her hair is nearly black , it is very long , and her body is long and slender . She is twenty-one years old ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple sweater and pants she is lovely , and he presses his face into her shoulder , her hair , he is squeezing her and her heels lift from the floor , then he kisses her and breathes from deep in her throat the scorched smell of dope . He looks at her green eyes : they are glazed and she is smiling , but it is a smile someone hung there ; Miranda is someplace else . But now her eyes are making some appeal , then they move away from Peter 's and when they return they are simply green again , bright again , and she nestles into his chest and murmurs , Only one little pipe , ' and he holds her ever more tightly , crushing against her the loneliness he always feels when she lowers between them the glass wall of her smoking ; the muscles of his arms and chest are taut with squeezing her , he is working isometrics against his heart , and it begins to give , it is subdued , it wo n't scream at her . It knows the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses her again , and they move through the living room  --  her black and white photographs are on the walls ; soon she will start working with color  --  and into the kitchen where she makes him a martini . She is not really a drinker , she has never drunk a whole martini , but he has taught her to make them and she likes to and when it is ready she tastes it , then hands it to him , and he sits at the table and watches her strong fingers peeling boiled shrimp . Herp123face is straining against the dope , she is trying to listen to him as he props his feet on a chair and sips the martini and unwinds . He tells her about his afternoon and the traffic driving home from Boston and she listens with exaggerated concentration ; her responding smiles come a moment late and are held a moment too long . By candlelight they eat shrimp cocktail while the sole broils , her kitchen is light blue , and from the walls hang red and orange pots and mugs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they eat fish and drink Chablis , she has only a couple of glasses because she is already high , he helps her with the dishes , and they linger still in the kitchen . He finishes the wine , the candles burn and drip and in their light her face overwhelms him , his blood is quick , she sees this and her smile vanishes , her face ages with passion , they rise and she leans over and blows out the candles , and they walk down the hall toward the music in the dark . In the morning he wakes first ; early sunlight comes through the window and he goes to it and looks out at the bright snow on the hemlock branches that nearly touch the frosted pane . He gets back in bed . After a while Miranda begins to wake ; he feels her watching him , and he turns his head . She is staring at him , the way his childrenused to stare from their baby beds ; he would pass the bedroom door and see Kathi lying on her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her eves staring wide and blank as though her mind were still asleep . Miranda is the only adult he 's ever seen wake that way . He is about to speak to her but she closes her eyes and is asleep . When she wakes again he brings her grapefruitjuice and they lie warmly and drink . ' Let 's eat lobsters tonight , ' he says . ' I 'll cook them . ' She looks away . Her eyes do not leave his but she looks away . It 's a talent she has . ' I wo n't be able to , ' she says . ' Oh . Well , maybe tomorrow night . ' ' I do n't think I 'll be able to then either . ' ' I thought we had plans for tonight . A movie . ' Did we ? ' ' I guess we did n't . ' This is the wad they end up talking . , Miranda has a fiance ; Peter does n't know w  --  hv .
