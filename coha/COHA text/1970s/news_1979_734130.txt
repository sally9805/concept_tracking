txt To the Editor : As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East , I am particularly sensitive to the issues raised by President Carter 's pledges in support of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty . I have noted , however , that the terms " aid " and " assistance " have allowed considerable confusion in media and public discussion of the settlement . It has been widely reported that the package will cost the United States $4.8 billion . This is not true . The President is proposing supplemental assistance of less than $1.5 billion over the next four years . The balance of the package will be in form of interest-bearing loans . The assistance package can be itemized as follows : ? The United States will underwrite military resettlement costs to Israel to the extent of $800 million . This represents far less than Israel 's estimates of the costs of relocating its defense perimeters in the Negev desert . ? The United States will make available to Israel $2.2 billion in military sales credit financing ? loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 10 percent per year . Israel has a perfect record of repaying loans on time with full payment of interest . It has repaid without default almost $2 billion in loans to the U.S. Government and approximately the same amount to holders of State of Israel bonds . ? The United States will make available to Egypt $1.8 billion , of which $300 million will be economic aid ( the mix of grants and loans is yet to be determined ) and $1.5 billion in the form of interest-bearing loans for military sales . ? Of the $3.7 billion in loans for military sales financing , only 10 percent will come from the United States Treasury . The rest will come from the Federal Financing Bank and will not affect taxes or the Federal budget . MICHAEL D. BARNES Member of Congress , 8th Dist. , Md . Washington , April 6,1979 Mothers and Sons To the Editor : The unhappy mother whose letter to her son you excerpted for the March 31 Op-Ed page may not know where her son is , but like her , I question whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unknown ; more important , he is trying to establish his own identity . His bizarre behavior is often a cover-up for insecurity . For him relevance is peer status and a new role in which he can discover where he 's coming from . His world is bigger now , and he wo n't be making profound remarks that touch your heart . Yet he still needs to hear you say you love him , and care enough to be upset by the transformation in him . What defeats us as mothers is that we can not mold our children after a certain age . They are experimenting with life , and we must accept them 119 they are . The meaning and purpose will return , but it has to come from within . ELIZABETH CLARK Oyster Bay , L.I. , April 1,1979 Letters Mideast Treaty , in Dollars Let Thousands of Windmills Provide Us With Energy To the Editor : The Three Mile Island nuclear accident is one of several such mishaps that have been considered lucky not to have been worse . A Congressional hearing April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency management agencies " the next time we have a similar incident . " Even more important is the implication of these accidents that next time we may not be so lucky . They emphasize that there are more ways a reactor can seriously malfunction than can be anticipated , so there is no dependable way of knowing what the chances are of having a much more serious accident . Widely advertised assurances about nuclear safety have lost credibility at Three Mile Island . There have also been assurances , often from the same source , that " there is no alternative to nuclear power . " Three Mile Island suggests that it is important to question the credibility of this claim as well . Policy statements of the nucleardominated Federal Energy Administration have been implying for years that large-scale wind power is like fusion power in needing extensive research and development before The Great Subways Of New York City To the Editor : The New York City subways have taken such a beating in the press lately that it 's time someone put in a good word for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City , I ride daily on SEPTA ( the Philadelphia counterpart of M.T.A. ) , Conrail , Amtrak , PATH and the New York City subways . The subways are far and away the best part of the trip . During February and March of this year , Amtrak 's performance was atrocious ? trains again and again anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours late . PATH , too , had frequent delays in that period . During that time I never had any delay whatsoever on the New York City subway system ? fast trains and plenty of them . As for SEPTA , New Yorkers do n't know when they 're well off . The local I take at North Philadelphia has a total run of 29 minutes , and it is habitually 10 to 30 minutes late . The reasons are a theater of the absurd . On several occasions a train was canceled because the crew never even showed up . I have yet to hear of that happening on the New York subways . Also , the passengerss on the subways are far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing are those pests of Amtrak , Conrail and SEPTA : the seat-hog ( who spreads packages and coats over two or three seats while people are standing ) and the loud-mouthed card group . And if you think there is pushing in the rush hour on the subways , you ai n't seen nothin ' till you 've boarded a PATH train at Newark . The rush of the New Jersey commuters for seats there is like the charge of the wild bulls at Pamplona . God help the aged and infirm . The only change that should be made in the subways is to outlaw handbags . That 's right , not handguns , handbags . Those dainty little women 's purses of a few years ago have grown as big as suitcases . With their sharp corners and heavy metal buckles and clasps , they are a lethal weapon in a crowded subway , and the Legislature should make it a felony to carry one . Either that , or legalize purse-snatching . Seriously , in spite of noise and dirt and graffiti , the subways are great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANTHONY DAY Lafayette Hill , Pa. ? April 3,1979 Children 's Year // Elena Pavlov becoming an important energy source in the next century . In keeping with this view , the Federal wind power development program has taken seven years ( and is still not quite finished ) producing commercial electric power from a megawatt-scale windmill , a feat that was accomplished in two years in Vermont by a small York , Pa. , firm about 40 years ago . Wind power could be an alternative To the Editor : There has been an unusual amount of reporting of corporate profits , stressing the large increase for the fourth quarter of 1978 compared with the fourth quarter of 1977 , and even a suggestion that the profit increases may be excessive . It is disappointing to see this implication as it conveys a very clear message : Most people still do not understand the exceptional success of the American economic system . Our poverty line exceeds the per capita income of almost all other countries . Not only were our employment levels during 1978 the highest in history but our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the population from the " baby boom " following World War II . Beyond this , we continue worldwide commitments , we continue to obtain new products from reserch and development , and despite massive inflation we have been able to maintain our standard of living fairly well . The ability to retain our current economic strength is based upon our Selective Punishment To the Editor : So the Government has decided it can not succeed in any prosecution of the farmers whose riotous demonstrations with tractors caused $2 million or $3 million damage to the Mall and other Government property . What a craven contrast to the Government 's relentless courage in prosecuting and sentencing Grace Paley and her peaceful group for demonstrating on the White House lawns . The White House lawn is no more hallowed ground than the Mall and Capitol grounds ( remember Andrew Jackson 's riotous inaugural party ? ) , and the Paley demonstrators had no more intention of harming the President or his staff with their banners than the farmers had of harming Congressmen with their tractors . The difference appears to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shameful business all around , and a foolish way for the Administration to continue throwing away its reputation . B. F. POE New York , April 3,1979 to much of the comtemplated increase ' in nuclear power and save money at that , if the Government would start now by contracting to build hundreds of large windmills in remote windy regions , supplementing its hydroelectric power . This should bring the economy of mass production into play and lead the way for industry and the utilities to build thousands more , just as Federal initiative once led the way to nuclear power . Otherwise , the trouble is that no one will invest heavily in largescale wind power until he sees someone else making money at it . Wind power is the one of the solarrelated energy sources that is technically and economically ready to go in a big way now , lacking only decision and financial backing to initiate the needed engineering and industrial effort . We once heard from a successful Presidential candidate that nuclear power would be used " only as a last resort . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power should be made an important part of national energy policy . The recent event . at Three Mile Island underscoresits importance . DAVID RITTENHOUSE INGLIS Professor of Physics Emeritus University of Massachusetts Amherst , Mass. , April 5,1979 unique capital commitment to investment in plant and equipment from which we derive employment , products and services . Fortunately , an estimated 80 percent of the capital needs of this country derive from reinvestments of profits , for the individual savings rate is quite low and interest rates are quite high , making both personal investments and increases in the debt markets difficult . It is because of this that there have been some recent suggestions that increasing savings and increasing investments might be a major factor in reducing the rate of inflation without having to cause a recession or create the abnormalities that can occur from fiscal or monetary policies . Finally , my memory is that halt the profits from most companies are taken in the form of taxes .

As a real graduate student , sweating it out bleary-eyed from too many nights of microfilm and peanut-butterand-jelly suppers , I believe I speak for my peers in saying that I found " John Smith " and his satire absolutely repulsive . It seems striking that " Mr. Smith " both writes of and is involved in the field of public relations , for when lying comes to mind , particularly as an occupation , P.R . is the prince among jobs . Myth has it that one always gets caught when telling an " elaboration " of the truth . " Smith " certainly did : trapped like a vagrant given the keys to the kingdom . My question : How many sleepless nights has he had since ?
