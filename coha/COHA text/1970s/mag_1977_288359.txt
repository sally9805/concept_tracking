The Bakke case brings a troubling racial argument to the court <P> As dawn broke over the white-pillared U.S. Supreme Court one day last week , more than 100 spectators were already clustered on the granite steps , huddled in bed rolls or stamping their feet to ward off the autumn chill . By midmorning the crowd had doubled and doubled again , stretching across the court plaza all the way to First Street . Photographers maneuvered to capture celebrities as they arrived , including Senators Robert Griffin and Thomas Eagleton , and Mrs. Earl Warren , widow of the Chief Justice who presided over the historic school desegregation decision of 1954 . As the crowds pressed forward , young demonstrators waved picket signs and chanted slogans . <P> Inside the court , every seat was taken by the time the principals began arriving . Archibald Cox , Harvard law professor , former Solicitor General and special Watergate prosecutor , was resplendent in black cutaway , striped tie and a matching gray crew cut . So was Wade McCree , in the Solicitor General 's traditional morning coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk intoned " Oyez , oyez , " and the nine black-robed Justices suddenly appeared from behind red velvet curtains and settled into their seats at the elevated bench . The stage was set for what could turn out to be the most important civil rights case in a generation , Regents of the University of California v. Allan Bakke . <P> At a signal from Chief Justice Warren Burger , Cox began presenting the case of the university . He underlined immediately the importance of responding to the charge that a white male had been excluded from medical school by " reverse discrimination " favoring disadvantaged minority candidates who were , by traditional admission standards , less qualified than the white . Said Cox : " The answer which the court gives will determine , perhaps for decades , whether members of racial minorities are to have meaningful access to higher education . " After a few minutes , Justice Byron White interrupted Cox to inquire about the adequacy of the trial record in lower courts . And then for two hours the Justices questioned the lawyers , Cox and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> From the questions it was clear that the Justices were struggling to adapt the most perplexing social questions into a manageable legal framework . They were obviously not comfortable . Justice Lewis Powell , normally the most courteous of Virginia gentlemen , uncharacteristically attacked Colvin : " We are here primarily to hear a constitutional argument , " he said softly . " You have devoted 20 minutes to belaboring the facts , if I may say so . I would like help , I really would , on the constitutional issues . " <P> Colvin could not help much . He focused his case simply on the interests of his client , Allan Bakke of Sunnyvale , Calif , a tall , blond engineer and father of two , who at 37 still harbors hopes of starting medical school . Bakke is largely a mystery to the world , for he has consistently refused requests for interviews . He earned two engineering degrees and fought as a Marine captain in Viet Nam , then decided to change careers . He started working as a hospital volunteer and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen medical schools . By then he was already 33 , and they all turned him down .
