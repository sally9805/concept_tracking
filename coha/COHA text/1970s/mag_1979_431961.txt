i  | What Happened When 5 Families Stopped Watching TV ? Their reward for a month of no TV was $500-but what they learned about themselves was more valuable . Some amazing things happened when five families gave up television for a month . ? One husband and wife stopped talking to each other . ? Two husbands began to chain-smoke . ? One woman took tranquilizers and talked to her cat . ? Two couples began to have more sex . ? Most read more , went to sleep earlier , visited more friends and relatives , ate out more often , went to the movies more frequently ? and got to know each other better than they had for a long , long while . The five familes had responded to an offer of $500 by the Detroit Free Press to stop watching television for a month . The newspaper made the offer to 120 families but 93 said no ? not even for the money ? proving rather conclusively that Americans are addicted to television . ( What other narcotic can claim 97 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected , the project proved quickly and painfully how important TV really was to their lives and how much they depended on it . The changes started as soon as the TVs were turned off . Not only were the sets unplugged , but technicians took out important tubes and wires so that the families could n't cheat . In their month without TV , the families missed professional and college football games , World Series baseball , the AliShavers fight and TV coverage of important news events , Bert Lance 's resignation as budget director , three plane hijackings and Bing Crosby 's death on a golf course in Spain . When the experiment was finally over , each of the five families vowed they would never again get hooked on television . Did they all keep their promises ? Here are their stories : THE FINLEYS Bob and Diane Finley and their children , Tracy , 12 ; Jody , 10 ; continued on page 97 Photographs by RI 94  | and Nathan , six , live on an 80-acre dairy farm in Howell , about 50 miles northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 , were high school sweethearts . After the family finished supper at 8 P.M. , the routine was always the same ? they all trooped into the living room and turned on the TV . The children also enjoyed Saturday ay-morning cartoons . Although they were avid viewers the Finleys only watched about 25 hours of TV a week , far below the national average of 44 hours . When Tracy found they were about to lose their TV for a month , she burst into tears . But Diane thought the would be beneficial for the family . The children passed the time by reading , playing records - and games , and practicing piano . Bob , who starts his day at 4:30 A.M. , began getting more sleep ? retiring at 9 instead of falling asleep in front of the set and dragging himself to bed at 11 . Diane spent more time sewing but missed the noise of the set . The biggest difference ? Suddenly it was easier to get the into the bathtub at night . " When we had the TV on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd miss something , " Tracy explained . Tracy admitted that she missed TV less than she 'd expected . But after the experience when Bob and Diane suggested they leave the TV off permanently , Tracy and Jody insisted on being allowed watch their favorite shows again . " TV 's not going to get me hooked again , " Bob said the experiment was over . The Finleys ' TV broke down soon after it was turned on again and it was n't replaced for four months . They survived quite happily without it ? thanks to the practice they 'd had . But at Jody 's insistence , Diane finally bought a TV at a country auction . Recently Bob admitted , " I 'm hooked again . I watch stupid boob tube until 11 at night , just like I did beforeOnce you get the thing going , you ca n't help but get addicted to it .

" Our sex life increased about 50 percent for the simple reason that we went to bed earlier and together , " Carol reported . She and Ed also talked more .

Richard , 35 , is a steam engineer for a steel company and Mary , 38 , keeps busy with housework and sewing classes . The TV provided regular nightly entertainment for the Elmores , who have no children . They were watching about 30 to 40 hours a week . Richard was confident he could survive without TV , but Mary was not so sure . The first days of the experiment passed easily .

In the evenings the Elmores spent more time together and talked about anything they could think of from news events to history . Ten days into the blackout , a crisis developed . There was a strike at Richard 's steel plant and he was locked in as one of the crew assigned to keep the plant operating . Suddenly Mary was stripped not only of her TV but of her husband too . She turned to her clock radio to give her some consolation . " It was so quiet , " she said . " I talked to my Siamese cat and he looked at me as if I were crazy . " She talked to her sisters on the telephone twice as much as before . Most nights Mary went to bed early . If she found herself awake at 3 A.M. , she 'd get up and cut out a sewing pattern .

You do n't realize how much TV becomes part of your life , " he said . After the set was back on , the Elmores vowed they would watch less . But two weeks later they were shamelessly devouring old favorites and even watching shows they 'd never cared about before . " It feels great , " Mary said , to walk 98 in the front door and switch on the TV right away . " A year later the Elmores moved into a new house and Mary took a job .

The living room of their Detroit bungalow is arranged around the TV with an easy chair for Bruce , 27 , the sofa for his wife , LuBertha , 27 , and miniature chairs for Marcell , six , and Tamya , three . ( LuBertha was pregnant N ith daughter Amanda during the month without TV . ) The Callaways ' TV often ran from early morning straight through to the late-night movie . LuBertha often watched 56 hours a week . The children averaged more time in front of the TV than in school . " I do n't know if I 'll be able to stand it , " LuBertha sighed before the TV was turned off . LuBertha 's first withdrawal pangs were over the seven soap operas she had followed faithfully for years . Her husband 's addiction was sports . Bruce , a union carpenter . began the experiment happily , but became grouchy . The Callaways turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circus . Eventually a sense of peace replaced their irritation . " I felt we were getting closer to each other , " Bruce said . LuBertha started feeling " more affectionate " toward her husband and their sex life picked up . LuBertha liked the new attention .  | Coached by their mother , the children practiced spelling their names and address . But not all was good . LuBertha experienced painful headaches and Bruce jumped from one to two-and-a-half packs of cigarettes a day . The day the television returned to the Callaways ' home re was a celebration . LuBertha turned on a favorite me show at 10 A.M. and ran the set straight through that ernoon and evening . A year later the Callaways found that they had slashed hours a week from their viewing time and Bruce had broken the habit of turning on the set the minute he came me from work .

For us , TV is almost a necessity because we ca n't afford to go other places , " says Ed Rychlewski , 44 , a credit manager who shelters his large brood in a Detroit suburb . Ed , his wife , Rosemary , 43 ; Ed , Jr. , 17 ; Marie , 16 ; Mary , 14 ; Michael , 13 ; Patrick , 11 ; Andrew . 10 : Helen , nine ; and Margaret , seven , are one of those close happy families . They watched TV an average of 53 hours a week before experiment . The kids know those commercials by heart . " Rosemary says . " Sometimes I think if I was inside commercial , I 'd reach them a lot easier . This is your mom speaking . Set the table .

" I think we 'll be a family again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably kill each other before this is over , " she said , laughing . The Rychlewskis got off to a rocky start . Ed and Rosemary stopped talking to each other . Ed tried to wean himself off TV and fatty foods at the same time and his double withdrawal made for a bad temper . The children adjusted remarkably well . They played games , read books , painted and listened to the radio . Tensions began to ease when Ed found his beloved football and baseball games on the radio . But he conceded early on , " It 's been extremely tough on me ? a disaster . " The kids discovered radio drama and seemed to be concentrating more on their schoolwork . By the month 's end , the Rychlewskis made peace with themselves . They even vowed to set aside two nights a week as no-TV evenings . If the children use this experience to watch on a more careful scale and keep in mind quality programming , then it will all have been worthwhile , " Rosemary wrote in her diary of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights had been scuttled but the Rychlewskis did keep the set off one night a week during Lent . The kids were reading more books and had even begun to listen to radio drama in place of some of their old , favorite television programs . The entire family was viewing more selectively . The Rychlewskis successfully reduced the amount of time they spent in front of the television from 53 hours a week down to 40 hours . " For prolonged periods of entertainment , " said Ed , " there is just no competition for TV. "
