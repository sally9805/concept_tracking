For reasons of pocketbook as well as policy , the U.S. is cutting its 3,500,000-member armed forces to 2,900,000 by mid-1971 , and eventually to 2,500,000 . At least part of the reduction will be made in overseas garrisons-and not just those in Viet Nam . Thus the Pentagon announced last month that the 62,000-man American force in South Korea would be cut by nearly one-third . Last week plans were announced to reduce the U.S. troop level in the Philippines from 24,000 to about 18,400 possibly by next July . <P> No sharp objection was expected from Philippine politicians , many of whom have been suggesting for years that the Yankees go home . In Korea , however , the reaction was quite different . President Chung Hee Park and Premier Chung II Kwon berated the U.S. for its decision . The Premier threatened to resign if the U.S. did not delay the withdrawal until 1976 and pledge $1 billion in military aid spread over five years to upgrade Korea 's own forces . <P> Last week , at a conference in Honolulu , Korea pressed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrawal was not negotiable . After two days of heated discussions , no timetable was agreed upon-though U.S. sources still expect up to 20,000 Army ground troops to be out by early next year . The U.S. did promise , however , to take several steps to bolster the 500,000-man ROK army . <P> Among the measures : the transfer of U.S. aircraft to Korea from other Pacific bases ; the shift of Navy tracker planes for reconnaissance and antisubmarine patrols ; and the accelerated development of defense industries in South Korea . The U.S. also reaffirmed a commitment to " render prompt and effective assistance " in the event of attack . <P> While the withdrawal of 20,000 men from Korea is partly motivated by economics . U.S. officials also explain it in terms of the Nixon Doctrine-that it is time for Korea to take care of itself , and that Korea is fully capable of doing so . Seoul disagrees violently . It maintains that withdrawal would gnaw away at the South 's morale while bolstering the confidence of the North Koreans . Moreover , the South Koreans argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event of another attack from the North . The North Koreans have a tough army equipped with modern weapons and bolstered by an air force that is far superior to the South 's . ROK troops have proved themselves tenacious fighters in Viet Nam , but at home they must make do with World War II-vintage weaponry . At present the two armies , along with two U.S. divisions , are engaged in a nerve-racking confrontation across the 38th parallel 's free-fire zone ; though the truce line is guaranteed by the 1953 U.N . armistice , there are sporadic outbursts of shooting . <P> Beyond that , there are cash considerations . Withdrawal would directly affect 12,000 Korean workers now employed by the U.S. military , along with hundreds of small businesses . The various businesses dealing with the U.S. military take in an estimated $160 million per year and stand to lose a good part of that if the scheduled withdrawal goes through .
