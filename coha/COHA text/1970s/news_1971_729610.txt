txt When the new $50-million Gateway Center , a massive downtown office and hotel complex , is completed here next Christmas , a covered glass bridge will link it to Penn Station so commuters can get to their offices without having to set foot in the streets . To some here , the bridge represents both the success and the plight of Newark 's downtown business community . Surrounded by increasing numbers of blacks , poor and unemployed , it has remained prosperous , white and controlled by people who live in the suburbs . Newark 's white business leaders , most of whom have committed their companies to staying in Newark , express serious concern at this growing gap between the two Newarks . They have instituted a series of programs , including remedial education , on-the-job training and building loans , to try to ' prevent the separation from widening . But Dr. George Sternlieb , the director of Rutgers University 's Urban Studies Center , believes that these changes are inevitable and that Newark is simply evolving faster in the direction that most American cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Dr. Sternlieb said in an interview , " is just the most accelerated case of the death of the old central city as we know it . In Newark the changes have gone further and faster than elsewhere in the country . We do n't really have any way of stopping it . " Among the signs of growing divergence between the two Newarks are the following : illRecently compiled statistics show that since the riots of July 1967 the creme rate in Newark , already the highest in the country , has increased 50 per cent . The number of unemployed slum youths has doubled so that today nearly one out of three residents is receiving welfare . elAlthough in 1967 Newark had the greatest percentage of slum housing among the nation 's cities , since then 8,453 units of housing have been demolished and only 3,907 new units have been built . 9Newark has remained the commercial and financial center of New Jersey , the nation 's fourth largest and one of its fastest-growing markets . Newark 's office space is largely filled , it has new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex is almost finished . Newark 's major companies , such as the Prudential Insurance Company , Western Electric and the First National State Bank , all have built new high-rise headquarters in the downtown area . Olewark is the first major , city in the country with more of its work force made up of commuters from the suburbs than from its own residents55 per cent to 45 per cent . Of Prudential 's 8,300 employes , 18 per cent live in Newark . Given Newark 's volatile situation , businessmen here have had to make a hard decision about whether to stay or leave . For some , like Robert Ferguson , president of the First National State Bank , New Jersey 's largest bank , it is a matter of good business sense to stay . " There is n't any question from a business viewpoint that Newark will continue to grow , " he said , in explaining why his company had built its new 20-story glass and concrete headquarters on Broad Street . " Northeast New Jersey is having an industrial and economic boom . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docks and an airport to service them . " For some other businessmen , tradition and sentiment are important . Howard Grad , a senior partner in the Grad partnership , New Jersey 's largest architectural firm with over 100 employes , said his company had been under strong pressure from workers and customers to move . " The employes were afraid to come to work , and the customers wanted a nicer place to visit , " he said in his newly occupied office in the Gateway Center . " We had to make a tough decision . But the overriding factor was our commitment to Newark . " Decided to Stay " My father , who was an immigrant , started the business here in 1906 and the city has been good to us . We did n't agree that Newark is dead , and we felt we could help by staying , so we have taken new quarters here in the Gateway Center . " Mr. Grad , who last year campaigned actively for Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson , , Newark 's first black Mayor , was disturbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office had been broken into , the bronze glass entryway smashed , and several typewriters stolen . But he remains confident that his firm made the right decision . " Newark is still going to be the financial center of the state . " A few companies , pressed for space or uneasy over Newark 's situation , have decided to move out . This week , for example , Triangle Industries , a small manufacturer of copper , steel and plastics products that had long been located in Newark , broke ground for a new corporate headquarters in suburban Holmdel . Most of the major companies that have decided to stay in Newark have undertaken some kind of program to try to help solve the city 's desperate urban problems , The Prudential Insurance Company , the largest company in Newark in terms of both assets and employes , is generally acknowledged to have made the most effort in this direction . Invested 897-Million In the last three years the Prudential , whose national headquarters are located here , has invested $97-million in Newark , including $47-million in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for construction of a large nursing center in the all-black Central Ward ? $11-million in industrial loans , and $10-million for housing . The Prudential has also loaned $172,000 to a black businessmen 's group for renovating Ebony Manor , a black club and catering service , and $55 , - 000 for creating the Bessie Smith Community Center in Clinton Hill , also an all-black neighborhood . In addition , the Prudential was the original sponsor of the Newark branch of the National Alliance of Businessmen  --  a program to find jobs for the disadvantaged . The company has a regular remedial reading and on-the-job training program for employes from the slums . And after Mayor Gibson was elected last year , Prudential loaned him one of its vice presidents to act as city business manager . Although only 14 per cent of the Prudential 's 8,300 employes are black or Spanish-speaking , the company says that 45 per cent of all new personnel hired are now black or Spanishspeaking . And 12 per cent of all new college graduates hired in Newark now are black . Despite Prudential 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has come under increasing attack from black leaders for failing to arrest the city 's decay . Its gleaming white marble office is easily visible from the empty , blackened hulks of buildings burned out in the 1967 riots . " There 's no question Prudential has done a lot , " remarked Gustav Heningburg , head of the Greater Newark Urban Coalition . " But the question is , how much is enough ? As long . as there is so much slum housing , business obviously has n't made enough money available for rebuilding . " " As long as most of Prudential 's employees are white , they are not fairly reflecting the racial make-up of Newark . " Mr. Heningburg , who is regarded as a racial moderate , feels that ? since Newark is 60 per cent black , businesses in Newark should have 60 per cent black employes . Imamu Baraka , the Newark black poet and playwright who was formerly known as LeRoi Jones , has charged that white business controls . Newark like a colony , exploiting the black people and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Role Weighed Donald S. , the tall , white-haired and distinguished-looking man who is chairman of Prudential 's board , is puzzled by what his company 's role should be in Newark 's urban crisis . He replies to Mr. Baraka 's contention by pointing out that the only money Prudential actually makes front Newark is whatever business its Newark sales agency does , and that is not a great deal . " We could pack up and leave Newark any time without loss to ourselves , " Mr. says . " We stay because this is where the company was founded and it is our home . " High Turnover Rate He notes that Prudt . tial has had a difficult time keeping the black employes it trains . " We spend two months to a year training someone as a computer specialist , and then one day they just leave without notice . The turnover rate for minority people is very high . " And black personnel from Newark who do stay for more than a year , usually move outto the suburbs after they have accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get requests for money nearly every day from some black leader who has a special project , " the Prudential chairman said . " Most of them we have to turn down as simply uneconomical , and so we are accused of not seeing the light . " We recognize that our society ca n't go on with such sharp cleavages . But how much can a business firm do ? Our primary obligation must still be to produce goods and make a profit . " Business just does n't have a magic wand that will make these problems go away . "
