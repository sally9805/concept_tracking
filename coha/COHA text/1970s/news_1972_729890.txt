txt It is the light shed on the operation of the Nixon administration rather than any specific new revelations that is the arresting part to many of the so-called Anderson papers being revealed by syndicated columnist Jack Anderson from hush-hush official documents on the India-Pakistan crisis . The whole issue of the so-called " Metternich role " of Dr. Henry A. Kissinger as adviser to the President on international affairs is brought up , by the exposure of how it works in practice . Dr. Kissinger is not secretary of state , and yet , in this instance , he was apparently calling the shots and delivering orders from the absent President to the prestigious top-level White House Security Action Group ( WSAG ) , including the head of CIA and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . // *Kissinger chief shot caller for Nixon , Anderson reveals // Washington Dr. Kissinger is liked by the press , and his frequent backgrounders are often illuminating and helpful , yet his credibility is now raised . In two backgrounders , for example , he said the administration had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet a confidential cable to Secretary of State William P. Rogers from U.S. Ambassador Kenneth B. Keating ( Nov. 12 ) at New Delhi reportedly said that war was " imminent . " A wave of sympathy for Mr. Nixon is expected on the grounds that nobody can carry on foreign policy easily or perhaps successfully when confidential talks at highest levels are disclosed . Almost everybody here seems to agree with this . On the other hand there is a feeling that official secrecy has been carried to preposterous lengths . This is another aspect of the instability in the situation , like Dr. Kissinger 's own role , that the Anderson papers affect . There are other aspects of the administration position . For example , advisers to the President simply shrug their shoulders ironically over the alleged " slanting " of the American press in ways counter to administration foreign policy in this instance , condsering it inevitable . Another theme is how President Nixon asserts authority over the prestigious WSAG through Dr. Kissinger . But in the Pakistan crisis WSAG did not meet directly at critical moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FBI continues search Meanwhile the FBI continues the search for the source of the leak , and two house committees are starting their own investigation . G. Warren Nutter , Assistant Secretary of Defense for Security Affairs , in an exchange with Dr. Kissinger during a White House WSAG session Dec. 4 , gave the administration 's mood to the press . It goes without saying , " according to Mr. Nutter , " that the entire press is slanting this war to place the entire blame on the Pakistanis and to show that they attacked India . " Mr. Nutter 's comment was recorded in a " memorandum for record " by James H Noyes , a deputy to Mr. Nutter. that was leaked to the columnist by sources unknown . It purportedly quotes participants directly instead of in paraphrase as in an earlier published memorandum pirepared by Navy Capt . Howard N. Kay . And like the Johnson administration . the Nixon administration has had trouble with the press . In this instance administration officials at WSAG discussed procedures for " tilting " government response against the  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Delhi Nixon anger discussed The WSAG was told of Mr Nixon 's anger at the version of affairs that was coming out from press backgrounders at the State Department . " Both Yahya West Pakistan President Yahya Khan and Mrs. Gandhi are making billicose statements . If we refer to Mrs. Gandhi 's in our statement , do we not also have to refer to Yahya 's ? " asked Samuel De Palma , assistant secretary of state for international organizations Dr. Kissinger replied . " The President says either the bureaucracy should put out the right statement on this or the White House will do it . Can the UN object to Yahya 's statements about defending his country ? " Mr. De Palma replied , " We will have difficulty in the UN because most of the countries who might go with us do not want to tilt toward Pakistan to the extent we do . " " Whoever is doing the backgrounding at State , " Dr. Kissinger reportedly answered . " is invoking the President 's wrath Please try to follow the President 's wishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
