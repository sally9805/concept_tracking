In the vaguely 18th century parlance of House parliamentarians , she is " the gentlewoman from New York . " Gentle ? It has been some time since the U.S. Congress has seen the likes - male or female - of Bella Abzug , the freshman from Manhattan 's 19th District . Bella is in the eye of the beholder , and like all true originals , she sometimes risks becoming a caricature of herself . <P> Her partisans know her as a raucously passionate crusader for minority rights , Women 's Lib and the antiwar movement , a truculent and courageous woman . To the less friendly , she comes on as a sumo liberal , a lady wrestler , Joan of Arc resurrected as an elemental yenta . No one , friend or enemy , denies that Bella Abzug has a certain presence . <P> Big Buddies . In her eight months in the House , she has made that presence felt with a characteristic indifference to protocol , notably the tacit understanding that a freshman Congressman ranks slightly above a page boy . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House doorkeeper , Mississippian William ( " Fish Bait " ) Miller , asked her not to wear one of her trademark broadbrim hats onto the House floor , she briskly replied , " Go f - yourself . " Actually , Fish Bait says , the exchange was jocular ; they are " big buddies . " <P> For a freshman , she has already had unusual impact in the House , upstaging even Brooklyn 's combative Shirley Chisholm , the first black woman in Congress . During one of her 18-hour days , Bella unearthed from the House rules an old tactic called a resolution of inquiry , which demands action by the House within the startlingly short span of seven days . Invoking that device , she pushed through the proposal that the President be directed to furnish the Pentagon papers to Congress . She succeeded in getting a sex-discrimination amendment added to the Public Works Acceleration Act . It was vetoed by President Nixon , but is now being redrafted with the Abzug amendment intact . In the recent effort to censure CBS President Frank Stanton , Freshman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of the press . She argues that the U.S. ought to get out of Viet Nam at once and get to work on urgent social needs , including better education and health care . <P> In her New York City voice that , according to Norman Mailer , " could boil the fat off a taxi driver 's neck , " Bella complains that " the U.S. House of Representatives has the distinction of being the most unrepresentative body in the <P> West . " Her logic : " Both houses are dominated by a male , white , middleaged , middle-and upper-middle-class power elite that stand with their backs turned to the needs and demands of our people for realistic change . " <P> Rhinoceros Qualities . Bella knows that her abrasive manner grates on her colleagues . As one fastidious member says : " When Bella comes roaring into the cloakroom , mutters a few four-letter words and elbows you out of the way , you want to treat her as you would treat any rude man . But sometimes when she has that hat off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face is really pretty . "
