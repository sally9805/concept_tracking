The death of Jomo Kenyatta last week , which raised questions about the future of Kenya , evoked sharp memories for a trio of TIME writers and correspondents who covered the African leader at different stages of his long and spectacular career . <P> Jim Bell , now a senior correspondent in Boston , went to Kenya in 1959 and was told by British colonial servants that Kenyatta was confined , or " rusticated " as they put it , near the Somali frontier . The militant Mau Mau leader was said to be a " hopeless alcoholic . " A year later , Bell met Kenyatta in a village in northern Kenya . He was tall and dignified , and Bell remembers him manipulating a fly whisk with great style and grace . At first he spoke haltingly , " not because he was a gone alcoholic , " Bell recalls , " but because he had n't spoken English in seven years . By the end , he was speaking as the London School of Economics scholar of anthropology he was . " <P> Correspondent Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in triumph to his village near Nairobi . Remembers Griggs : " In the crush of thousands I only managed a handshake and a few words , but I was instantly impressed . The handshake was firm and the eyes were almost blazing with determination . " Griggs asked if he was bitter about his long detention in the desolate north of his country . <P> The eyes softened a little . " The British will see the error of their ways someday , " he said . <P> Griggs also recalls Kenyatta giving speeches in three languages : " He would lead off in deep , booming English for the whites , talking of how Kenyans should not resent foreigners but understand that they were in Kenya to help blacks develop . <P> Next , in Swahili , he would urge tribal unity on the country . Finally , in Kikuyu , he would tell his own tribe 's people that he was still virile . That always evoked loud cheers . " <P> By the time Bill Smith arrived in Kenya in late 1962 , Kenyatta 's country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it again and again , if I had to-again and again , " said the leader , speaking of the revolutionary activities that cost him years in exile and prison . " It was the only way . " Like his predecessors , Smith was impressed particularly by Kenyatta 's presence . " He really was the father of his nation , and with his seniority and strength he was indomitable . " <P> Now an associate editor , Smith wrote this week 's World story on the African leader , drawing on files from David Wood , our current bureau chief in Nairobi . The passing of Kenyatta , perhaps the last of the grand old men of the African nationalist movement , is a milestone in the history of independent Africa .
