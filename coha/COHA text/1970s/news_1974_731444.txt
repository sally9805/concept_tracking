txt The dreadful truth is out : after the U.S. oil shortage , it 's . .. bagpipes . The plaintive skirl of the Scottish warpipes is gathering fans across the land , but there are n't enough pipes to ea around While pipe bands are popping up all over the place ? or would if they could ? back in the ancient home of the clans the craftsmen can find neither time nor materials to keep pace with U.S. demand . Potential American pipers , elbows poised to squeeze , must wait for months or even years to buy that ultimate in Celtic culture , a real Scottish bagpipe . True , a brazen lowland amateur may perhaps pick up a cheaper Pakistani set of pipes ( although even those are scarce ) , but few pipers would dare to look a brawny Highland Scot squarely in the eye with one of those tucked underneath his arm . " Not only would I not touch one with a 10-foot barge pole , but I would n't touch one with a 20-foot barge pole , " declares K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bagpipe Importers , New York 's Scottish Products , Inc. // *Bagpipes hard to find // " It 's like taking a plastic ukulele from a corner store and putting it up against a Stradivarius , " Mrs. Ramsay adds with a boiling Scot 's indignation . Bagpipe experts explain that some Pakistani and other makers resort to inferior woods which easily split in changing U.S. temperatures , are often difficult to tune , need black paint ( which may peel ) , and ? worst of all bagpipe crimes ? may have to have a metal tube inserted down them ( " you can imagine what that does to the tone " ) . Blackwood needed It seems that it 's the special refinement of the Scottish instrument that is the main cause of its shortage . For only African blackwood seems able to produce ( without cracking , or metal support , or paint ) that wailing , lilting tone which sends the proper shivers of delight through devotees ? while prompting the less enthusiastic to spurn the Instrument as " an ill wind that nobody blows good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sultry forests of central Africa . ( It is darkly rumored In the trade that " the Japanese have bought it up , " that " the African governments have kicked out the Asians who used to harvest it . " ) Then , too , ivory for the trimmings Is scarce , silver is expensive , and fine craftsmen are rare . . . While the Scots , it seems , are not a people to be rushed merely to meet the raucous demands of a distant American market . 50 sets on order So , Mrs. Ramsay has had more than 50 sets of pipes on order for three years ? selling for $295 to $1,000 and upward ? and would dispatch them to enthusiasts across the country if she could get them . And Mal Ross , partner in New York 's Wee Scots ' Hoose , does n't expect his small February order to be filled until at least December . And San Francisco 's Scotch House has been waiting for nearly two years for its batch . Nor is Ireland any easier a source of quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine months to order eight sets of pipes for his budding group of young learners at St. Ben-edict 's Church in Queens , N.Y . ? but can not even extract a reply from the Irish craftsmen . So his score or so of youthful pipers ? like other hopeful handlers of that Celtic " pregnant octoput ! " across the states ? resort to " practise chanters " ( no bag ) , or borrow from more fortunate friends . " It 's an exciting type of instrument , " exclaims a new convert to the great Highland warpipes ? if you can find one .
