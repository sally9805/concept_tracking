 | Talk is cheap , the old saying goes . But the aftermath of certain kinds of talk can be expensive . There is talk which injures , talk which alienates . And since Barbara Walters talks for a living , Good Housekeeping asked her for some opinions about how hurtful talk happens , how to avoid it , and how , when it 's unavoidable , to deal with it . As a professional conversationalist , Barbara Walters talks to heads of state about the state of their heads , she talks to people who know things and to people who do things , to people flushed with success , and to people racked with trouble . In 1970 , she wrote a book ? How To Talk with Practically Anybody About Practically Anything ? and in 1975 , she is still practicing ( on NBC 's Today show and her syndicated program Not For Women Only ) what she preached in that manual . Approaching a television guest , she tries to be non-mischievous , direct ( asking the questions we at home are asking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has ever deliberately hurt a guest . " I ca n't think of anyone I 've shattered , " she says . " If I wounded them , people would n't agree to do interviews with me . " Even so , there are times when Barbara Walters , like any of us amateur talkers , wishes she could go back and say something differently . " If I had it to do over again , " she says , offering a forinstance , " I would not have questioned Lady Bird Johnson about the rumor that her husband had been a lady 's man . Her answer was wonderful . She said , Lyndon was a people lover , and that certainly did not exclude half the people in the world ? women . ' But I 'm sorry I asked because those things can be misconstrued . There had been books ? notably Barbara Howar 's ? which made it sound as if President Johnson had gone beyond mere flirting . I knew how warm he was , and how cute he 'd been with women , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was always the love , the deep relationship between them , and that 's what I was trying to bring out . But when the exchange got into print , most of the people who read it had n't seen the program , and thought I 'd said the President was a chaser . It embarrassed Mrs. Johnson , and I wish I had n't ever @#  | raised the issue . " Differentiating between what she calls " high class " gossip , and gossip that hurts , Barbara says the first kind seems to her harmless , and everybody indulges in it . " Even serious news magazines have gossip columns . Gossip represents curiosity ; it represents a feeling about life . Show me someone who never gossips , and I 'll show you someone who is n't interested in people . " What I think is okay is gossip about people like Liz and Richard or Jackie Onassis . Talking about the woman down the street is not high class , because that woman can get hurt . " According to Barbara , the same stan- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewer is trying to get a guest to reveal himself on the Today show or a private person is dealing with a friend . " How far do you go ? " she asks . " If you hear that a couple is separating , do you ask them if it 's true , or do you wait till they tell you ? If you 've heard that a friend has a drinking problem , do you march up to her and say , Matilda , everybody 's talking about how loaded you were last week at the charity tea ' ? " Answering her own question , Barbara says it depends on the closeness of the friendship . And whether you 've picked up on an isolated rumor , or the story 's all over town . And whether you know your own motive for passing along hurtful talk .  | " Are you repeating a rumor because you want to help , or because it 's kind of exciting ? My feeling is , if you 've heard ? or overheard ? something you think is doing a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or could make things tough for her child at school , and if that person is an intimate , you might very well say , Look , perhaps this is n't true , but there 's been so much talk about it that maybe you ought to know ' I think if 20 people tell you that your best friend 's husband is planning to divorce her , you might bring it up to her . But if someone tells you , I saw Charlie at lunch with a blonde yesterday , ' you should forget it . At any rate , that 's what I 'd do . " Sometimes the person about whom hurtful talk is circulating wants to connfront and refute it , and does n't know how . Barbara cites the case of Mamie Eisenhower , victim of a widespread tattle that she drank . " I knew she was anxious to talk about it , " Barbara says , " because when I asked her before the program we were doing if she wanted a glass of water , she said , No , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air Barbara inquired whether Mrs. Eisenhower was aware of the rumors about her . Mrs. Eisenhower said " Yes , I know they say I 'm a dipsomaniac , " and proceeded to declare that she was a teetotaler , but that an inner-ear imbalance often caused her to lurch . Later , she wrote to Barbara and said she loved the interview , but some people can actually hallucinate hurtful talk and still demand to know why Ms. Walters called Mrs. Eisenhower a drunk . News reporters , of course , have to wrestle with a unique moral issue when it comes to hurtful talk . They 're pulled between the demands of their profession and the demands of decency . " I spend my life trying to draw people out , " Barbara says , " and I know there 's thin line between news and gossi . I mean were discussions of Nixon 's personality ? which was relevant to Watergate ? news or hurtful talk ? " Here 's another example . I went to a dinner party one Friday night . I had just finished doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this party a doctor high up in the cancer-research field came over to me and said , You know , Happy Rockefeller is going to have the other breast removed on Monday . It will be announced on Sunday . ' And he walked away . I thought : why did you tell me ? I wrestled with it . I could have rushed to call my network , but I did n't . It was a time when the Rockefellers should have been allowed to tell their own story . It was their right . We were n't discussing a war , just a private misfortune , and I 'd heard about it by accident . Though it would have meant a big scoop , I thought the country could wait a day to hear it from the Rockefellers themselves . " If it 's a question of illness , mental or physical , that 's not gossip , that 's pain . " Sometimes , in order not to go back on her word to a friend who trusts @#  | her , even an innocuous secret is kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that Jackie Kennedy was going to be married the following Thursday . " She asked could I guess to whom . I went through a few names : Mike Nichols , Lord Harlech . And she said , You 'll never believe it , she 's going to marry Aristotle Onassis . ' And then she gasped , Oh , my God , why am I telling you ? You have to promise you wo n't say anything ! ' I wanted to keep the friendship , so I said nothing . But by the next Wednesday , I felt I 'd done my bit ? and I could n't stand it any more ? so I called NBC News ( I was out of town on a story ) , told them what I 'd heard , and suggested that perhaps they should put cameras in front of Jackie 's house . They did n't take it seriously . Thursday night , I was sitting on a bed in a hotel room and I heard David Brinkley announce the engagement . I started to scream in frustration . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has said is something you have to develop in your own head . Nobody can teach it to you , Barbara contends . Recently , Betty Ford gave her an unusual glimpse of the White House . " She took me through the bedroom she and the President share , and into the bathroom and their dressing rooms . Although a description would have made interesting TV conversation , I felt the tour had been for my ears and eyes only . " On the other hand , when people are public about the intimacies of their lives , then you can be too . For example , I think if unmarried people are living openly with each other , you 're not hurting them if you talk about it . You can say , Tell me , does n't your mother worry ? ' or , How do your kids feel about your living this way ? ' If they 're open , you can be open . " But even with guidelines in your own head , you can come a cropper . A year or so ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him why he and Dinah Shore did n't get married . " Why do n't you get divorced ? " Reynolds barked , adding , " I do n't have to discuss Dinah . " A somewhat shaken Barbara held her ground . " Well , Mr. Reynolds , " she said , " you 've discussed her in all the movie magazines and you were n't asked here to talk about Watergate . " Still , the Reynolds episode troubled Barbara , and she uses it to illustrate how careful one has to be . " You 've heard that a friend 's kid cheated on his exams ? When you think of asking his mother about it , also think of the next step ? what will be the reaction to your asking ? If I had known Burt Reynolds was going to snap back at me and embarrass us both , I 'd never have brought up the subject of Dinah . " But nobody can tell you how to judge whether or not you 're likely to hurt someone ; you 've got to have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burt Reynolds , his love life was all over the papers , so I did n't worry about it . But when I interviewed Rex Harrison , even though he 'd pub-  | lished an autobiography in which he discussed his five wives , I could not sit down with him and ask why he 'd gotten all those divorces . I could have written it ? in reviewing his book , say ? but I could n't talk about it , because he 's a very shy man . And I thought , it 's just not that important . We did talk about Kay Kendall ? he knew she had leukemia and was going to die when he married her ? because that was important , and it was a touching part of his life . " Barbara proclaims herself wary of people who use hurtful talk as a gift ? " They come , not with a box of chocolates , but with somebody 's head on a platter , hoping to win your friendship " - and she suggests that when the head on the platter is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . For people in show business , she says , no response is generally the best reponse . Especially when the attack is in print . " If somebody writes something bad about you and you react , you give it leqiitimacy and make it a bigger deal . " A couple of years back , Barbara says , a hatchet job was performed on her in the magazine section of the Sunday New York Times . The first girl who 'd been given the assignment backed away from it after telling Barbara she was n't willing to do the piece which had been suggested to her . " I know the sort of people they want talked to , " the writer said . " I should have refused to be interviewed then and there , " Barbara says , with the wisdom that comes of hindsight . " But I was flattered because it was The New York Times . And then they assigned this man , and I felt , how can he hurt me , I 'm a nice girl . I mean really , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went downstairs to a restaurant that 's part of the RCA Building , not at all an elegant restaurant , and I ordered this cheese pie which they call quiche Lorraine . And I thought , I 'm going to open myself up and let this man know what I 'm like . So when he asked , What are you working for ? What are you striving for ? ' I said , ' Look , I have to work . ' It was the first time I had ever publicly talked about certain things , like the fact that my sister is retarded , and the kind of insecurities that had given me . When the article came out , it began by talking about Miss Walters who shed crocodile tears over her quiche Lorraine as she told the familiar story of her sister . ' " Barbara cried for weeks over the article ? " It really hurt me " ? but she cried in private , knowing the reverberations would be fewer if she did n't react . Occasionally , though , she says you must react @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorced three times . It was totally inaccurate , and if it had gotten picked up by other papers , it could have done me harm , so that hurtful talk had to be answered . But when I called the paper , they said , If it 's true , Miss Walters , we 'll print a retraction . " If it 's true ? ' I yelped . Do you think I 'd lie about this ? ' After I hung up the phone I thought : Things have  | gotten so bad that these days we disbelieve everything . ' " Hurtful talk in one 's private life is often easier to cope with than public assaults . " If you know that someone has said something about you , and it bothers you ? and it may be true , lots of times hurtful talk is true ? straightforwardness can help , " Barbara suggests . " Do n't telephone . It 's better to be able to see the talker 's expression . Confront him or her face to face . Then say , Mary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my questions . Did I do that ? If so , I did n't mean to . ' Put it in terms of a question . Why would you say thus and so about me ? Maybe I can learn something from you . ' " A straight reaction is always best . To someone spreading slander you say , " I heard you said I 'm seeing Vera 's husband . You ca n't imagine how something like that hurts me . " That 's better , Barbara says , than spreading the story further by telling some third person you 're innocent , and asking that person to go back and explain to Vera that you 've never laid a glove on her husband . " Do n't make it bigger , " is one Walters rule . " Do n't put it in writing , " is another . " I 'm wary of writing , " she says . " A tough lawyer once told me , Never write a letter , and never throw one away . ' I rarely write love letters ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't put You said this or that about me ' in a note . " While gossip is the most common form of hurtful talk , Barbara points out that " good advice " can upset people too , " unless they 're very mature , or very thick-skinned . Somebody shows you a speech he 's about to make , and asks what you think of it . If you say , It 's lousy . Let me give you some constructive criticism , ' he 's not going to want to hear it . Even though he wants you to be honest , he 's hurt . And hurt people get defensive . " If someone very close to you asks , specifically : What did you think of my report ? My hairdo ? , there 's a time and a way to tell the truth . " The time is later , " Barbara says . " The next day . And after you 've picked out something good , something complimentary to say first . I loved this part of your report , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lightened it and parted it on the side , but ? ' " Even then , do n't kid yourself . The but ' is going to hurt . " Anytime a viewer writes something particularly mean to Barbara , she fires back what she describes as an " obnoxiously grateful " note , thanking him for his constructive criticism . " I do it , " she says laughing , " to make him feel guilty . In the same way , a private person referring to a community theater performance can say to someone , I understand you thought my performance was terrible last night . I thank you for your honest comment ; I 'm sure I 'll learn from it . ' If it 's possible to sniffle a little , that helps ? " ( Barbara also writes to everyone who says anything complimentary about her ? " Most people are more likely to respond to nasty comments than to kind ones . I like to thank people for being nice . I think it 's lovely to acknowledge kindness . " ) As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says no discussion of the subject would be complete without some acknowledgment of one 's children 's contributions to hurtful talk . " What do you do when your child repeats gossip ? " she asks , and answers herself . " There 's nothing you can do . If you have young children , you ca n't gossip . Not only ca n't you gossip , but you 've got to be careful to live an immaculate life because they gossip about you . Sometimes when I 'm terrifically busy and the phone rings , I shout , Tell them I 'm not home . ' Jacqueline 's old enough now so she picks up the phone and screams , Mommy says we 're not home . ' " Children teach you the difference between what can be repeated and what can not be repeated . Especially children between the ages of five and nine . By nine , they already know what they should n't say , and before five , nobody totally believes them . I 'm very careful about what I say in front of my child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wear a girdle , or a hairpiece ; she even says things that are n't true , just to be funny . Someone will come to pick me up , and she 'll say , Mommy will be late , she 's naked , ' when I 'm fully dressed except for earrings . " Her own mother , Barbara recalls , used to say , " If I tell you I 'm 22 , I 'm 22 . If I call it black , and you think it 's white , it 's black . Do not correct me ! ' " That seems terrible to Barbara in this day and age . Says she , " I certainly do n't want to bring my child up to be a hypocrite and a liar ? but I 've never figured out what the alternatives are . Recently , Jacqueline stopped me cold by asking , What 's a white lie ? ' That was after I 'd told her that saying on the telephone that I was n't home was a white lie . " I remember talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to be truthful , to have integrity . Then their children hear them sweet-talking someone on the phone and then , after they hang up , saying , That bore , or That witch . So no matter how much you lecture your children , they get the picture . ' " I was very impressed with that . Now that I 'm older and wiser , I realize we 're all human , and there are certain things ? call them manners , white lies , good grace ? which make life more civilized , and we just have to hope our children wo n't give us away . " But my advice to anyone who has a child between the ages of five and nine is : Never open your mouth ! " Despising unkindness ( she ca n't bear those TV shows where celebrities sit around and try to list the other celebrities they think are most boring ) , Barbara says she still " agonizes " when she prepares an in-depth interview , worrying about how far she can go . " And I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure that after we hurt somebody , we should n't go home and think not only : How did I do it ? But , why did I do it ? What 's in it for me ? " Everybody ? the boss , the visiting celebrity , the woman in town who seems so poised and sure of herself ? has feelings . We 're all hurt by the same things , and everybody can be hurt . That 's the great equalizer . " In the end , Barbara Walters ' advice seems to come down to trying to keep your sense of balance . " Do n't be terribly upset if once in a while something unpleasant is said about you , " she says . " And do n't be upset if once in a while you gossip , and it backfires . " After all , it was 1610 or thereabouts when Miguel de Cervantes wrote , in Don Quixote , " There 's not the least thing can be said or done , but people will talk and find fault . " And since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
