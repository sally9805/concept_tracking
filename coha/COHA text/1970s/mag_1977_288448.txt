DELMORE SCHWARTZ : THE LIFE OF <P> AN AMERICAN POET by James Atlas <P> Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ; <P> 418 pages ; $15 <P> When Saul Bellow wrote his roman a clef , Humboldt 's Gift , even knowledgeable readers had trouble recalling the model for Von Humboldt Fleisher . The difficulty would not have occurred if Bellow 's chief character had been based on Robert Lowell or John Berry man or Theodore Roethke . Yet , for these celebrated poets , Delmore Schwartz was once the front runner of their generation . <P> No young poet since has so dazzled his peers . When Schwartz 's first book , In Dreams Begin Responsibilities , appeared in 1938 , Critic Allen Tate called it " the first real innovation that we 've had since Eliot and Pound . " T.S . Eliot himself was " much impressed . " <P> Nor was Schwartz 's achievement limited to verse . The title work was a brilliant short story whose narrator witnessed the past courtship of his mother and father , interrupting with cries of " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No less a judge than Vladimir Nabokov placed this tale - written when Schwartz was only 21 - among his " half a dozen favorites in modern literature . " <P> Delmore became a member of the Harvard faculty . He joined the prestigious Partisan Review crowd . He began a long poem , Genesis , which he believed would secure his place as a poet and cultural hero . John Berryman recalled his colleague just " waiting for fame to descend . " <P> That descent never came . What happened to the promise , the flamboyant charm ? With care and intelligence , James Atlas chronicles a decline as moving as it is horrifying . By the time Schwartz reached 30 his center could no longer hold . He had started to drink heavily . His marriage broke up . One day in 1947 , suddenly and finally , he left Harvard , convinced of his double exile from the American Dream : as a poet and as a Jew . <P> As his spiral curved down , Schwartz ran through more and more women , more and more colleges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , California , Syracuse . His ambition to be the Great American Poet deteriorated into a panicky need for money . Inspiration was replaced by alcohol and amphetamines . The body went to flab , the handsome face to coarseness . Fellow Poet Hayden Carruth remembered Schwartz slouching toward 40 : " He looked and spoke like a defeated shipping-house clerk . " <P> Yet Delmore never stopped trying . Through the chaos of his life , trailing from one rented room to the next , he made desperate resolutions : " To get up at eight o'clock-and to take vitamins , join a gym , buy new clothes , answer mail . " Occasionally there was rebirth , as with his poem about the disciples , " Starlight like Intuition Pierced the Twelve " - Schwartz always could write titles . But below the labels the quality was diminishing .
