&gt; In 1969 , University of Maryland Physicist Joseph Weber astonished the scientific world with the claim that he had detected gravity waves-a phenomenon predicted by Einstein 's 1916 general theory of relativity but never confirmed by actual observation . Since then , scientists in half a dozen countries have tried to duplicate Weber 's experiment ( in which he measured tiny deformations in two large aluminum cylinders ) ; but none of these efforts has been successful . Now still another negative report has been filed . Using a detector at least as sensitive as Weber 's equipment , IBM Physicists Richard Garwin and James Levine write in Physical Review Letters , they were unable to pick up any signal that could reasonably be called a gravity wave . The IBM researchers were not surprised . <P> They note Weber 's contention that the waves he detected seemed to be coming from the center of the galaxy . If so , they say , the waves would presumably have to be of such great magnitude at their source that the entire galaxy would have burned itself out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Soviet Chemist Boris Deryagin 's report in 1962 , polywater was a totally different form of water -a thick , sticky substance that had a boiling point of about 1,000 F. , and a freezing point of - 40 F. Moreover , it closely resembled plastics or other polymers in molecular structure in that its molecules of hydrogen and oxygen atoms were linked together to form long chains . Scientists round the world were fascinated . But no one else was able to produce more than a few drops of the miraculous water and skepticism began to grow . Now even Deryagin has washed his hands of polywater . In a recent scientific paper , reports Chemical &; Engineering News , the Soviet researcher admits that it is nothing more than ordinary water contaminated by silicon . Where did the silicon come from ? Apparently it was picked up in the hair-thin quartz tubes that he and other scientists used to produce the stuff from condensing water vapor .
