txt To outward appearances , life in Greece under the colonels is n't harsh  --  and it 's getting better . The strikes and political instability , so common before the Greek army seized power in April 1967 , have disappeared . Statistics indicate the economy is thriving , and nearly everyone is making more money . Many political prisoners have been released . Students seem content , more interested in fashions than in antigovernment protests . Even the newspapers are free to criticize the military regime a little . " There 's a trend toward liberalization , " says an American official here . He says the cabinet is working hard to restore more civil liberties and that Prime Minister George Papadopoulos , the military junta 's head man , is " a moderate who no doubt wants a return to parliamentary democracy . " The U.S. Government , citing these changes as hopeful , recently said it would restore full arms shipments to Greece . Yet , under the surface , martial law is more apparent than any democratic trends : On the day the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuts down a musical review that had mildly satirized the regime . " For a dictatorship , the regime is comparatively mild , " says Evangelos Averoff-Tossitsa. a former foreign minister of Greece . " But it has strengthened its hold . We have less freedom now , not more . " Rewriting History Others are equally critical . While business conditions have been good , they say that government economic statistics are misleading and that a financial crisis looms . Although press censorship has been lifted , they note that editors exercise rigorous self-censorship out of fear . And education , from the lower grades to the university . is under the control of military men who rewrite history , intimidate teachers and expel or jail students . Some well-connected Greeks , staunch supporters of the government , say the junta is in the midst of an internal crisis . They speak of a clash between Mr. Papadopoulos and Nicholas Makarezos , the minister of coordination and the junta 's third-ranking official . For the second time in two months , young " hard-line " army officers and other subordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . But even opponents of the regime do n't look upon these rumors as a sign that the dictatorship will disintegrate . " I 'm terribly frightened by the younger officers , " says one Greek who has been threatened by them . " They want very radical changes in our foreign and national policy . " These officers are sometimes nicknamed the " Nasserites , " because of their alleged intent to nationalize industry and steer an independent course in the manner of the late President Nasser of Egypt . Restaurants Are Crowded Neither these internal stresses nor the government 's authoritarian nature is at all visible to the tourists who are flocking to Greece in record numbers . Foreign newspapers and magazines are available at well-stocked kiosks throughout Athens . There are no huge banners proclaiming the " revolution , " as the government calls its coup . The streets are jammed with fearless Greek drivers , intimidated neither by police nor by one another . At night the restaurants are crowded , and the bouzouki music twangs as before . But , say many Greeks , life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are suspicious of strangers , and , sometimes , even of friends . " The Greek people are scared to an unbelievable extent , " claims Mr. Averoff , the ex-foreign minister . In the sidewalk cafes and other public places , the normally voluble Greeks refrain from anything resembling political small talk . " I wo n't discuss politics with anyone who 's not an old friend , " says a professional woman . Mr. Averoff is an exception . He freely criticizes the government , either in interviews with foreign newsmen or directly in letters to Mr. Papadopoulos . Mr. Averoff 's attacks are n't published in Greek newspapers , however . He apparently is so well-known that the government is leery of trying to silence him . Cautious Editors " Freedom of the press is only a mockery , " says Mr. Averoff . " Theoretically , censorship has been abolished , and you can publish what you want . But after the Ethnos case , editors are more careful than before . " In March , four editors of the 57-year-old daily paper , Ethnos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antistate propaganda " in an interview with a former politician . The paper then ceased publication . A Western diplomat agrees that editors are more circumspect now . Nevertheless , the government is subject to some press criticism . One newspaper attacked the junta 's plan for a " mini-parliament , " a government-appointed body with no airect power , as reminiscent of " fascist and nazi methods . " Other papers show discontent by taking frequent digs at the U.S. , singled out by government opponents as the regime 's strongest friend abroad . One paper published U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings that contained scathing criticism of the junta by Sen. William Fulbright . Despite Mr. Averoff 's criticisms , the government has renewed his passport and those of many political foes . Many lesser-known Greeks , however , have had theirs revoked . A professional woman knows 10 friends  --  five lawyers , three doctors and two teachers  --  who have lost their passports . A government spokesman says that a total of 6,400 passports have been revoked because of " antistate " activities . Indeed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its citizens has been loosened . Practically every family has a relative who has been searched or questioned by police . A 29-year-old secretary recalls that about a month ago police summoned her mother and accused her of propagandizing against the state . The woman , who had never been politically active , denied all charges and eventually was released . " But a week later she had a nervous breakdown , " says the secretary . An Athens psychiatrist says that many Greeks are suffering psychological stresses that he attributes to the " current repressive environment . " And he reports a sharp rise in patients with severe neurotic tendencies . But , he quickly adds , he has no intention of publishing his findings . Although the regime has freed a large number of political prisoners recently , life apparently is rough for those still held . A widely publicized report of the Council of Europe documented cases of torture of these prisoners . To counter criticism stemming from the report , the Greek government entered into a one-year agreement with the International Red Cross allowing that organization to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government said it would n't renew the agreement because the need for the visits no longer exists . An official here at the Red Cross , which has never published its findings , declines to discuss the matter . Coup Welcomed at First When the coup took place , it was at first welcomed by many of Greece 's 8.8 million citizens . The political situation had been unstable , and - governments shuffled in and out of office . Strikes frequently closed down public services . And the new regime made some welcome moves . It immediately canceleil $250 million in farmers ' debts , for instance , and stepped up highway and other public construction projects . At first glance , the economy also seems to have prospered . " The Greeks have a word , ' apithanos ' ? magic  --  that might well be used to describe how Greece through August 1970 , was able to raise its gross national product at constant prices by 7.5% while holding the rise in the consumer price index to 2.8% , " begins an American embassy assessment of the economic situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greek economy and generally healthy prospects for the future carry favorable implications for the United Statkm. , " Not everyone agrees . John S. Pesmazoglu , a 52-year-old former deputy governor of the Bank of Greece , says Greece 's economic situation is basically unsound and potentially dangerous . Using official statistics , he notes that the average annual rise in gross national product over the past three.and-a-half years was 6.3% , compared with 7.6% in the preceding four years . He says that not magic but inaccurate statistics account for the small rise in consumer prices . A source close the the Bank of Greece says that it will soon revise upward its consumer price index to 4.5% . The Bank of Greece refused to discuss this and other related economic questions . Mr. Pesmazoglu and other critics say Greece 's worsening economic situation is reflected in its widening trade deficit . The deficit ? including such " invisible " transactions as shipping and insurance charges  --  deepened in 1969 to $343 million from $247 million the year before , an increase of more than 38% . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , compared with $224.2 million in the 1969 period , despite higher revenue from tourism and shipping . Few Foreign Investments A flow of foreign investments into Greece would offset this deficit . However , the investments are n't coming because , critics say , foreign companies are fearful of eventual political instability here . Many Greeks are particularly critical of President Nixon 's decision to resume full arms shipments to Greece . Mr. Pesmazoglu , for example , believes this move , plus frequent visits to Greece by Pentagon officials , including Defense Secretary Melvin Laird , demonstrate that the junta has American backing . " It 's shameful that the American Embassy is continually presenting the regime 's point of view , " he adds . " American officials are coming to be known here as the lawyers for the colonels . " Other Greek businessmen say that because of what they term " American interference " in Greece , anti-U.S . sentiment is rising fast . This is disputed by some Americans here . " It 's a phony charge ? I 've never been in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a U.S. embassy official . Thomas A. Pappas , a Greek-born American businessman with some $200 million invested in this country , also denies that anti-American feeling exists . " The long-term business climate is very good , and the Greeks love Americans , " he avers . Among the Pappas interests are the EssoPappas oil refinery , ammonia and steel plants and a Coca-Cola bottling concern . Mr. Pappas discounts as isolated incidents the bombs that were exploded at his Esso-Pappas headquarters building on Constitution Square here , at the nearby American Express Co. building and at the U.S. embassy . " You do n't see any rioting , " he observes . Vital to NATO American officials are quick to reply to critics who say that , instead of sending Greece arms , they should have applied more pressure against the junta . Says a U.S. official : " It does n't follow that we can dictate to the Greeks what they ought to do . They are n't influenced much by foreign criticism . They go pretty much their own way . " The official adds that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been effective . Because of this ineffectiveness ? rather than any strong trend toward democracy  --  the arms aid was resumed since Greece is considered a strategically vital NATO member . " We did n't put the cnionels in power in the first place , " he says . " We are n't supporting them ? and they wo n't go away no matter ' what we do . " The government now is trying to establish a firm political foundation before elections will be called , most observers agree . The members of the new mini-parliament , for instance , will owe their allegiance to the current government that hand-picks them , many critics say . The government is also using the education system to build for the future . Military " commissars " have been appointed to head the three Greek universities - and are in charge of the nation 's entire education system . One development is that the school-leaving-age has been lowered from 35 to 12 . Another is that the number of students receiving higher education in Greece declined from 19,000 in 1967 to 11,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in education is most evident in the elementary grades .
