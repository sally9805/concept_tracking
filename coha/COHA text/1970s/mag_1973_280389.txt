Like Paris hemlines and Italian governments , women 's hair styles tend to rise and fall with cyclical regularity . Bearing names reminiscent of characters in a Disney movie ( the Pixie , Poodle , Ape and Artichoke ) , those styles have often been far more decorative than practical . This summer , however , the favored wave in hair styling reflects convenience rather than elegance . It is the summer of the scissor in hair salons across the U.S. , as starlets , social-register types , housewives and coeds are emerging with their hair cut shorter-and simpler-than many a man 's . <P> " Women are tired of the motorcycle-helmet look , " says Atlanta Hairdresser Don Shaw , who arranges more than 1,600 heads a month . " Hair that looks natural looks feminine . " The essence of that natural look is brevity-wash-'n ' - wear hair occasionally trimmed as short as an eighth of an inch . The result : hair as suitable for tennis in the morning as for dinner out at night . For its wearer , rollers and pin curls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing , so too is the hair treatment in many salons . Lacquer spray and other synthetic chemicals are giving way to " natural " preparations . Shaw , for instance , favors avocado oil and mayonnaise , which he claims make hair shiny and restore the natural oils lost through bleaching . <P> Fancier shops now boast resident " hairologists " whose only mission is to prescribe the proper natural treatment and conditioning for feeble follicles . To test the latest in hair care , TIME Reporter-Researcher Audrey Ball visited Sassoon 's , a leading Manhattan salon . There under the direction of Hairologist George Resh , a single strand was plucked from her head and examined in a Jape microgram calculator . The machine pronounced her hair dry and brittle , with its tensile strength hovering between an " excessively deficient " and " deficient " protein structure . <P> " For treatment , " Ball reports , " I was acidified with a protein shampoo , conditioned with a ten-minute bake job under the dryer ( after which my head felt as though it had been thrust in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of dusty road ) , shampooed again , and then finished off with a creme rinse . After 40 minutes of treatment , I at last got to go to the styling room where , with a quick snip of the scissors , five inches of my newly conditioned hair was sent to the floor . " <P> Customers , of course , are leaving more behind in salons than their hair . Ball 's tab came to $47 , including tips . Though easier to maintain , the natural look is no less costly to acquire , and satisfied patrons usually return in five to six weeks for more conditioning and another cut . For dissatisfied patrons , life can be more difficult . Unlike hemlines , haircuts can not be committed to the closet . In most cases , this summer 's new look will continue into fall , and winter as well .
