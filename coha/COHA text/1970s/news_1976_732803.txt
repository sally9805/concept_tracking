txt The name of the game at the Geneva conference on Rhodesia is to keep it going . And the most important fact after nearly two weeks of hesitations , openly voiced suspicions , even threats of breakdown , is that the conference is still on the tracks . The chairman of the conference , Britain 's Ambassador to the United Nations , Ivor Richard , said Monday he was moderately encouraged by the progress of the talks . " We are in a negotiation , " he added . " If people were walking out or something , that would be a different situation . It is proceeding in the somewhat erratic way I thought it would . I really do n't see it in crisis terms . " - On Mr. Richard 's shoulders more than anybody else 's rests the responsibility for keeping all the parties ? black and white ? at the negotiation table until they have agreed on a timetable for early transition of political power in Rhodesia from white to black hands . This is to be done within the framework of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Kissinger and the leaders he met when in southern Africa last September . To complicate things , there are differing versions about what was agreed then // From page 1 *Rhodesia talks are ' still on tracks ' Mr. Richard was back in Geneva late Tuesday after an overnight flight to London for consultation with Prime Minister James Callaghan and Foreign Secretary Anthony Crosland . Presumably they discussed whether some fresh British initiative might be needed to help give the conference momentum . Interestingly , while Mx . Richard Was back in London for consultation , two top U.S. State Department officials who have been helping from the wings to keep the Geneva talks going were back in Washington for presumably parallel consultations with Dr. Kissinger . The two are Assistant Secretaries of State William Schaufele and John Reinhardt . The immediate hitch in Geneva is over the proposed date for independence for Rhodesia under a black majority government . Rhodesia 's Prime Minister and , white-minority leader , Ian Smith , says Dr. Kissinger agreed there should be an interim period of two years before independence . He reiterated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But perhaps significantly his accompanying words seemed to leave the door open for a shorter period . The African nationalists at Geneva ? who believe that independence under a black government is long overdue ? say two years is far too long : they press for independence after at most a year . Searching for agreement on a compromise , conference chairman Richard has proposed March , 1978 , as the target date for independence . Both blacks and whites have rejected this . Mr. Richard has privately met the black objections by saying that once a target date had been agreed , there is no reason why successful momentum toward independence should not automatically advance the date . Because of the stalling of the talks on a date for independence , there have been suggestions that either the British Foreign Secretary or the U.S. Secretary of State should personally fly to Geneva to rescue the conference from collapse . But Mr. Richard 's remarks in London Monday implied that any such point had not yet been reached . In any case , it is unlikely that either the British or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except as a measure of last resort much further down the line. ? Meanwhile both blacks and whites continue to put pressure on the Geneva conference from outside . The African nationalists pursue their guerrilla activities in Rhodesia itself . The Rhodesian security forces strike back .
