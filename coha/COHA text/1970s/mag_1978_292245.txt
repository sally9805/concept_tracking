Overcrowded on weekdays and underused on weekends , Sunrise is solving its problem in true Las Vegas fashion : a lottery for all those who agree to enter the hospital on weekends , with a weekly prize of a $4,000 vacation . Since the game was started 14 months ago , admissions have jumped by 60% , to about 85 each weekend .
