Who is the last White House staff member to see the President at night ? Who wakes him in the morning ? Who spends more time with Richard Nixon than Henry Kissinger ? Who is privy to the periods of presidential reflection during walks on the beach ? Haldeman and Ehrlichman of the palace guard ? Political Operatives Dent and Chotiner ? No . The correct answer is Manuel ( " Manolo " ) Sanchez , 41 , the President 's man , an ebullient Cuban refugee and family servant for nine years . <P> Manolo is always there : waiting by the buzzer in his third-floor White House apartment or West Wing office for the signal to retrieve papers or bring the tray from the kitchen for a working lunch . He serves as a one-man gallery for presidential bowling in the basement , sits quietly in the Executive Office Building hideaway while Nixon works alone late at night , gives the word to Secret Service men and military aides about the departure time for presidential trips . He is the one free spirit of the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who jokes with the press in fractured English and breezes past the protective shield that rebuffs Cabinet members and Congressmen . <P> One or Two . Once Manolo and his wife Fina , 40 , were the Nixons ' personal servants , cooking , keeping house , chauffeuring-first in California , then in New York . The White House staff takes care of those duties now , although Manolo defensively explains that on weekends at Key Biscayne or San Clemente it is like the old days when Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez were in charge . Manolo 's chief duty now is being on hand when Richard Nixon wants him . <P> On New Year 's Eve , Nixon invited newsmen into his office for a taste of his " secret " martini formula . It was not long before the press corps discovered that Manolo knew the vaunted recipe . But there were no high-level disclosures : " I give you my secret formula for daiquiris , " he offered . " How about that ? " He dispenses footnote facts-Nixon has orange juice , cold cereal and grapefruit for breakfast-but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more controversial information , such as which newspapers the President reads during breakfast : " Oh , one or two . I really can not say . " The gentleman 's gentleman has even begun to look like the boss : Manolo 's sideburns have fallen to mid-ear level in recent months ; his hair has become fuller above the temples , and the greasy kid stuff has disappeared . The reason : Manolo has placed himself in the hands of Nixon 's hair stylist , Milton Pitts . <P> The Sanchezes , who have no children , came to work for the Nixons shortly before the 1962 California gubernatorial election . Nixon Pal Bebe Rebozo recommended the couple after they had been forced to leave Cuba with their wealthy Italian employer . Manolo 's English was so bad in the beginning that Nixon often had to leave notes for Fina to translate .
