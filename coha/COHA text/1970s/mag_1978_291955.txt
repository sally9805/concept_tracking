For Hubert Humphrey , politics was joy , and better days were always coming <P> Six a.m. in front of a factory gate in Miami , March 1972 . A gaggle of droopy-eyed campaign aides and reporters . The somnolent scene suddenly springs to life . The candidate appears , Hubert Horatio Humphrey , once again running for the presidency . Smiles , handshakes , banter-only the voters are missing , since no one has shown up for work yet . No voters ? Humphrey will find them . He sprints into the street , waving and calling out to passing cars : " Hi , I 'm Hubert Humphrey . " Drivers slow down , gaping . Humphrey thrusts a hand through the window for a hurried shake . Dodging the traffic as nimbly as a matador , he blurts out to nobody in particular : " I love it . I really love it . " <P> He truly did , and the scene was repeated endlessly throughout one of the richest and most remarkable American political careers of this century . Humphrey was sheer political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped talking because he never stopped politicking . Politics was his life , his breath , his inspiration , his entertainment . The public and private Humphrey were indivisible ; he was what he appeared to be . There were no dark patches of mystery . He kept so little distance from the voters that he suffered from what was called a " mystique gap . " But when some of the hidden flaws of more heroic figures came to light , Humphrey 's old-shoe familiarity shone by contrast . <P> He preached not only the politics of joy but the politics of plenty . He was the quintessential , unrepentant New Dealer . Government existed to serve the people , and the more of everything it served the better . He was easily moved to tears over the plight of others , and figured he was put in this world to do something about it . If he was always on the attack , it was seldom against people but against what he considered to be injustice and deprivation . Malice was not in his bones . <P> Bursting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other public figure of his time . He was a driving force behind the civil rights bills of the 1960s , federal aid to education , the Peace Corps , Medicare and the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency . Humphrey , in fact , kept going at full liberal throttle when others were beginning to slow down and wonder if they had not gone too fast with programs that were not working out . But to reconsider , to calculate , to calibrate was not to be Hubert Humphrey . When he died last week at 66 at his Lakeside home in Waverly , Minn. , after a long and agonizing bout with cancer , his liberal boots were still firmly on .
