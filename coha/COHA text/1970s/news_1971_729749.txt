txt It has been nearly a year now since Kevin applied for permission to marry . But the church often moves too slowly for men like him , a Roman Catholic priest who once dedicated his life to the church . He now finds he can not cope with two basic controversies raging within it : the role of the priesthood and the question of priestly celibacy ? the required vow not to marry.1 At odds with the celibacy requirement since he was ordained 10 years ago , Kevin , now 36 , dated several women , some of them nuns , during his years in the active ministry , tho he knew the church disapproved . Marriage Not Only Cause However , his other troubles with the priesthood prompted him to seek permission to be removed from the active ministry . Marriage was the secondary reason . " Primarily , J asked to be dispensed frorn:the active ministry because I was unable to live with the tension and pressure of polarity among priests , " he said . " The prosnert of marriage gave me a hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Impatient , somewhat confused and uncertain as to how long it would take for approval from the Vatican to travel thru channels , he acted without permission . Marries Former Nun Last month , he and a former nun were married by a friend who is a priest . They moved from the Chicago area to a small community in the southern part of the state , where he is working as an educational consultant in a private firm , keeping their marriage a secret from the church until permission comes thru . For this reason , their names have been changed in this story . Kevin was constantly at odds with many priests for his antiwar activities , social action involvement and his association with various ministers and some black groups . He felt his work was hampered . " I just could n't be effective with all that pressure , " he said . The question of celibacy , he insisted , is not an issue of physical sexuality . No Summer Frolics " The concept that a priest runs away to Florida two weeks in the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell is ridiculous , " he asserted . " Priests are trying to find out what this celibacy thing really means . " I dated both nuns and other women  --  a lot of dating goes on in the neutral atmosphere of a college campus or summer school , " But you always had the feeling you were being sneaky . Each individual was working out the problem alone . Years ago , optional celibacy was n't discussed like ' it is now . When a priest left to marry , it was a scandal . Now many lay people support a married clergy . " We must change the image of priests and stop putting them on pedestals . They are human beings . " Sees No Bar To Duty If given the option , . he believes , many priests would choose celibacy , while others would marry and be just as effective . " I do n't know whether it was wise for . us to marry without permission , " Kevin said . " But , it is n't as tho we decided to leave one week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The decision to leave is a terribly painful one . I remained in my parish for six months after making the decision and requesting a decree of laicization . " This decree w o u l d mean that he had been reduced to the lay state and not permitted to perform the priestly functions of saying mass , administering the sacraments or teaching religion . Want to Stay in Church " It could take three more months or maybe even three years for the decree to come thru , " he said . " It 's all a bunch of bull ? . " Yet Kevin and his wife , Marilyn , say they want very much to be Catholics in good standing and responsible members of the church . Continuing , his activist role , Kevin is n't sure if he would go back into the active ministry if the c elibacy ruling were changed . " I do n't believe at this time I would want to be a pastor , " he said , " but I would work part time in a parish . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't feel like a priest at this time . " I still have some guilt feelings I have to work thru . "
