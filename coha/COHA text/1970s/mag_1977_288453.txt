The apostle of " Mere Christianity " converts a new generation <P> The road to England 's Whipsnade Zoo is hardly the Road to Damascus , but it was dramatic enough for a brilliant Oxford don who traveled it one September day in 1931 . As he later described his adventure : " When we set out I did not believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and when we reached the zoo I did . Yet I had not exactly spent the journey in thought . Nor in great emotion . " <P> No blinding light or voice from heaven for Clive Staples Lewis ; but his conversion on that picnic excursion had some of the impact of St. Paul 's . The ruddy-faced writer 's works were to lure innumerable souls into the precincts of belief . Fourteen years after his death at 64 , this Pascal of the Space Age is the only author in English whose Christian writings combine intellectual stature with bestseller status . <P> Besides his eleven overtly religious books , C.S.

Like so many other unbelievers , Vanauken and his wife Jean dipped into Lewis upon urgings of Christian friends , began devouring all the Lewis books they could find , and wound up , to their surprise , as converts . Then Jean died of a liver ailment , and Vanauken plunged into despair . It was an astringent letter from Lewis that enabled Vanauken to make some sense out of her death-and his life . Longtime Bachelor Lewis later suffered similar tragedy when he married a woman he knew was dying of cancer .
