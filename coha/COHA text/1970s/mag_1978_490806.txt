THE TALK OF THE TO ' ' N Notes and Comment SALUTATIONS to Chief Redbird , of the Cherokee Nation , who for more than sixty years has supplied the White House , gratis , with ceremonial headdresses handmade from eagle or turkey feathers , one headdress per elected President . He 's outlived most of the recipients : Woodrow Wilson , Warren G. Harding , Calvin Coolidge ( do you remember those photographs of Coolidge in an Indian feather bonnet ? ) , Herbert Hoover , Franklin D. Roosevelt , Harry S Truman , Dwight D. Eisenhower , John F. Kennedy ( whose disdain for any kind of headgear nearly put the hat manufacturers out of business ) , Lyndon B. Johnson . Richard M. Nixon was so honored ; not so lucky Gerald Ford ( whom we usually picture in a ski cap ) . Republican or Democrat , each accepted and politely responded to the Chief 's benison , which , if the recipient did n't put it on at once , at least reminded him briefly that the Great Spirit was keeping an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance and response perhaps constituted virtually the Executive 's entire interest in Indian affairs . ) Redbird is now seventy-eight and is in a hospital far from Oklahoma , but he did manage to send the newest President his habitual favor of welcome this year . The President 's staff , according to the Times , sent it back , saying that Mr. Carter does not accept gifts from the public . The Chief , who is unable to speak now , is reported to be " despondent . " The new Administration has striven to be businesslike without being bureaucratic  --  to achieve a kind of warm efficiency  --  and yet there 's something here that chills the heart . " This bonnet is n't a gift . It 's a symbolic tribute to the nation 's chosen leader , " says the father-in-law of Chief Redbird 's daughter , in the Times . Without considering the wrongs of the red man , or the emptiness of symbols , or the importance of the demystification of high office , we wish that the nation 's chosen leader could have forsaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so gently meant . ADISAGREEABLE word has lately gained a new currency : " blow-back . " It was introduced into general circulation during the recent House Intelligence Oversight Subcommittee hearings on the relationship of the C.I.A . to news organizations , and it refers to deceptions that , having been planted by the C.I.A . in the press abroad to fool people in other countries , have wafted back into the United States in one way or another and fooled Americans as well . In the opinion of sonic congressmen at the hearings , it was all to the good that the foreigners were being led to stumble around in a world of misinformation but unfortunate that the Americans were deceived  --  an accident that everyone concerned seemed to regard as the equivalent in psychological warfare of hitting friendly troops with your own fire . Everyone was especially concerned that American officials had sometimes fallen victim to blowback , and one witness , who had formerly been on the staff of the CIA. , described efforts he had made on several occasions to apprise policymakers that they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting Americans from deception is no doubt heartening , but its hope of embargoing the tainted material from our shores suggests some basic misunderstandings about what facts  --  or , as in this case , non-facts  --  are . Governments call their propaganda campaigns psychological warfare , but facts are quite different from bullets or other ammunition . A bullet will go where it is aimed and will then self-destruct . A fact , however , lives on . Its progress continues long after it has been sprung on the particular enemy that the psychological warriors wished to inform or misinform . The C.LA. seemed to have in mind the creation of certain zones of misinformation , to which its deceptions could he restricted . The general reliability of information in such zones would presumably be poor it would be like a form of perpetually bad weather . The United States , by contrast , would be a zone of truth , from which faulty news would he excluded . But facts are both migratory and long-lasting . They can cross borders , and , even if they disappear from sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about results that were entirely unexpected by whoever released them . These peculiarities of facts are well known to anyone who has succeeded in getting a newspaper to retract an error . The retraction never reaches precisely the audience that saw the mistake . And , even if it could reach the original audience , that audience would by then have passed the mistake along to a second audience , which would be altogether unreachable . Once a fact has been released into the air , it can freely blow back and forth and sidewise , and not even the most powerful government in the world can dictate where it will go . ? ? Live TOWARD the end of Luciano Pavarotti 's recent Metropolitan Opera recital , a voice from the back of the hall yelled " Bravo , prima tenoref " ? a simple and accurate description of Mr. Pavarotti 's present status in the musical world . Now forty-two , he is the only classical singer who has ever performed a complete live recital before a national television audience  --  his Metropolitan concert was televised at 4- P.m. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the only one who has ever given a solo recital at the new Met . His clear , sweet , well-focussed lyric tenor , which is supported by a formidable vocal technique , has been compared to the voice of Caruso or of BjOrling , His extraordinary-ability to communicate with an audience reminds some people of John McCormack . And his repertoire  --  which includes bel-canto roles that have n't been sung accurately for fifty years , except by him ? is a remarkably eclectic one , ranging from the baroque arias of Gluck and Handel to the intensely dramatic role of Cavaradossi in Puccini 's " Tosca . " We renewed our acquaintance with Mr. Pavarotti on the day of his televised concert , and can report that he is the same engaging mixture of hardheaded north-Italian practicality and Latin charm which we remembered from a previous meeting . He is also just as nervous before a performance . We arrived at the Metropolitan shortly after 3 P.M. to find Mr. Pavarotti  --  large , bearded , with his throat wrapped in an enormous brown knitted scarf  --  warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clutching the edge of a Steinway , he sang Donizetti 's " Una furtiva lagrima , " Leoncavallo 's " Mattinata , " and Bellini 's " Vanne , o rosa fortunata , " listening carefully to the reverberation of his voice in the hall . Then he walked back to his dressing room to sit in front of a lighted mirror while a makeup man combed his glossy dark-brown heard and shadowed the sides of his face with a dark foundation stick . " What time is now ? " Mr. Pavarotti asked , looking grim . " Three-forty-five , " an associate said . " I would not give these last two hours before a concert to my worst enemy , " Mr. Pavarotti said , putting his hands over his face as the makeup man released a cloud of hair spray . " Is a great , beautiful profession , but not just before you go onstage . " He looked at his reflection in the mirror and said , " Very good , but I wo n't stay dry . The lights burn me up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the makeup man . " Otto minuti prima delle quattro , " the loudspeaker said as Mr. Pavarotti emerged from his dressing room looking elegant , if uneasy , in white tie and tails . " Is shirt all right ? " he asked John Goberman , the producer of the " Live from Lincoln Center " series , of which this recital was a part . " It 's fine , " said Mr. Goberman . " I do n't think it will flare in the cameras . " " La cravatta , " said Annemarie Verde , Mr. Pavarotti 's secretary . She reached up and straightened his white tie  --  a large one  --  which had tilted up toward his right ear . Charles Riecker , one of the Metropolitan 's artistic administrators , put a comforting arm around Mr. Pavarotti 's massive shoulders and said , " Remember , Luciano , everybody loves you out there . " " I hope they still love me after , " Mr. Pavarotti said . " When I think of those millions of people who watch on television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked across the empty Metropolitan stage , paused at the stage manager 's desk to sign some programs for the stagehands , and took up a position in the wings , with his chin resting on top of a five-foot metal curtain-control box . " Houselights going out , " said the stage manager , Tom Connell . Mr. Pavarotti took four deep breaths , pulled a large white handkerchief from his pocket , and walked briskly onstage with his accompanist , John Wustman . The delicate , poignant melody of " Una furtiva lagrima " filled the house . We could see Mr. Pavarotti 's broad back , rigid with tension , as he leaned forward with his w eight on the soles of his feet to produce a high A. At the end of the first three songs , he bounded into the wings to sip soda water and let the makeup man mop his face and neck with a towel . " I like these friendly people , " he said . " E meglio cantare per amid . " ( " It 's better to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert  --  after five enthusiastically applauded encores , a blizzard of torn programs , and flowers handed up from the audience  --  he came offstage smiling broadly and said , " Is a very warm public , and I think In voce worked well . For sure , they heard my pianissimo on television , but I think four thousand people out there could hear it , too . " " Now you sing Pagliacci , ' " said Mr. Wustman with a grin . " Now I go out and thank the audience  --  e baste , " said Mr. Pavarotti , hugging his pianist . Roses N 7 A.M. on the day before Valen- tine 's Day , we were standing in a snowy parking lot at Pinchbeck 's rose farm , in Guilford , Connecticut , looking at a twelve-hundred-foot-long greenhouse . Many of the panes were frosted with ice ; the rising sun behind the greenhouse gave some of them a shimmering flare of yellow ; others showed light-blue sky or wavery clouds of pink . The concrete base of the greenhouse was encrusted with shiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the concrete , inside the glass , we suddenly noticed a deep-red rose sticking up , then another , and another , and another , and we went inside to look around . ( Over the Valentine 's Day period , we 'd heard , Pinchbeck 's would cut , grade , pack , and ship about a hundred and fifty thousand roses  --  mostly a variety called Forever Yours  --  from some ninety-five thousand hushes , sending them to the American Wholesale Cut Flower Company , at 44 West Twenty-eighth Street , in Manhattan 's flower district , wholesale and retail florists Connecticut . ) The inside of the greenhouse was vast , warm , and silent , and it-smelled like one enormous rose . The countless glass panes overhead divided the sweep of sky into pink and blue rectangles with white borders . There was the occasional soft , almost imperceptible dripping of water onto leaves . The rosebushes soared six or seven feet high , rising from thickly clustered beds , three and a half feet wide , that ran the length of the greenhouse and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heat and water hung overhead . Between the rose beds  --  sixteen of them were laid out side by side  --  were narrow dirt paths less than two feet wide . We could look down the path on which we stood six hundred feet in one direction , then turn and look six hundred feet in the other ; at either end , the space between the bushes was only a tiny slit of light at the vanishing point . To walk , we had to move like a figure in Egyptian art  --  our feet going forward but our torso turned sidewise  --  and the leaves and thorns kept brushing against our clothes . We saw a stocky , smiling man in green work clothes coming toward us , holding an armful of roses . He introduced himself as Norbelto Solivan. said he had been in charge of growing roses at Pinchbeck 's for the last twenty years , and , grinning , indicated that he could not shake hands : he wore two-inch sections of old pink garden hose on the thumb and forefinger of his right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife . As he cut the roses , he explained , the sections of hose protected his thumb and forefinger . He looked up at a rose at the top of one of the hushes , and in one sweeping gesture the rose was lopped off , to rest on its eighteen-inch stem in the pile on his arm . " W c tried clippers once , " Solivan said . " But I did n't like them . They were kinda slow . " He said he had to change the hose on his thumb every two days , but the forefinger tube lasted two or three months . We asked him how he had got into the rose-growing business . " I used to live in Cayey , Puerto Rico , " he said . " I worked on a tobacco farm . Tobacco is easier than roses . The only thing we had to do was dust for hugs . With roses , you got to watch everything . When I was eighteen , I came to Guilford to work in a factory . I got laid off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smiled again . He looked at the roses on his arm . " If the sun shines , you get a nice , beautiful red , " he said . " IF it 's cloudy , you get a paler color . " " Should we go halfway down ? " said a girl 's voice very nearby . We could n't see her ; it was solid jungle . " Yes , " said Solivan . " O.K. , " said the girl . Solivan told us there were eleven people besides him working in the greenhouse that day ; they would form three teams and cut roses from all ninety-five thousand hushes twice a day . He moved off to put his load of roses in water , and we went crabwise through sections of white roses , pale pinks , orange pinks , dark oranges , and miniature deep reds , and then into an adjacent brick building , which houses the fur naces , the refrigerating rooms , and the grading and packing area . WUEarn Cordts , the man in charge of sales and packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , and black rubber boots , showed us around . Half a dozen women , up to their ankles in rose leaves , were wrapping roses in cellophane at big tables ; another woman was dropping freshly cut roses one at a time into a weird conve% or-belt machine called a jamafa . " The Jamafa sorts them for size , " said Cordts . " The length of the stem determines the price . " Long , narrow trays , each holding one rose , went bobbing along on the belt until they approached an electric eye . This measured the shadow of the rose , then tripped a device that turned the tray upside down , ( lumping the rose into one of six compartments , which could accommodate roses with stems as long as thirty inches and as short as ten . Defective roses and those with weak stems or stems shorter than ten inches : ; re never put on the conveyor belt at all . These flowers , called culls , generally end up in paper cones on sidewalk displays at bargain prices . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred in a brown cardboard box , adding shaved ice , " like you get in a Coke , " and ships them out . We went into the greenhouse again to say goodbye to Solivan , and ran into a blond , elfin young woman who was cutting in one of the endless alleys . " How do you like the work ? " we asked . " Fine , " she said . " I really like roses . But when I go into a flower shop they seem . prettier . " Gordon Davis THE new Commissioner of Parks and Recreation , by order of Mayor Koch , is Gordon J. Davis , who is thirty-six years old and is the tallest ( six feet five and a half inches ) man , as well as the first black man , to get the job . He is the tenth Parks Commissioner since 1934 , when Robert Moses took command of the first consolidated department for the city 's parks . Commissioner Davis is in charge of twenty-four thousand acres of New York City property ( roughly twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-one hundred permanent employees ; three thousand Comprehensive Employment and Training Act employees , whose salaries are paid by the federal government ; five hundred and seventy-two parks ; nine hundred playgrounds ; a hundred and four swimming pools ( nine indoor pools , thirty-seven large outdoor pools , fifty-eight outdoor mini-pools ) ; fourteen golf courses ( including one pitch-and-putt ) ; five hundred and thirty-five tennis courts ; six beaches ; three zoos ; seven ice-skating rinks ; a hundred boccie courts ; seven hundred and nine baseball , softball , football , and soccer fields ; six hundred thousand street trees ; two million park trees ; fifteen hundred vehicles ( including mowing machines , sweepers , road graders , road rollers , beach-sand sifters , and mobile recreadon units ) ; and thirty-four recreation centers . Cultural Affairs , which was detached from the Parks Department two years ago , now has Henry Geldzahler as its Commissioner . ( We wrote about him a couple of weeks ago . ) A few days after Commissioner Davis went on the city payroll ( fifty thousand dollars annually ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the third floor of The Arsenal , in the Park at Fifth Avenue and Sixty-fourth -- a light-filled perch with white-painted walls , a sky-blue carpet , the three obligatory standing flags of country , city , and Parks , a couple of framed photographs on almost empty bookshelves , and a rickety-rectangular oak table that was bare except for a calendar , two pencils , and a telephone . Commissioner Davis , who was standing behind the table when we arrived , was wearing a navy pin-striped suit , a tattersall shirt in red , white , and blue , and a red foulard tie . He looked to us like the handsomest city official since John Lindsay . With one foot , the Commissioner was nudging a telephone-dictation contraption under the table , trying to maneuver it out of his way . " I 'm just getting rid of the last of the stuff I found in here that I do n't need , " Commissioner Davis told us . " I 'm not sure what this machine under here does , but I do n't need it Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , that kind of thing  --  I had taken out because I felt it was n't reflective of what this department is . This office should be reflective of parks . I had the table brought in because I ca n't fit my legs under a regular desk . " A young woman came in and handed him a sheet of paper . " My first administrative assistant , liable Mitchell , " Commissioner Davis said , introducing us , and continued , " Leave the door open , please , Mable . " Then he turned to us and said , " I try as much as possible to keep the door open . I do n't like to be isolated , secretive , or whatever . This , by the way , is more like my first real day on the job . I 've been struggling with snow problems until now  --  what to clear first , how to get our equipment working on snow removal wherever we were needed . I was something like an assistant Sanitation Commissioner . It was a great opportunity to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great extent , you know . At one point , I was looking at snow conditions here in the Park , and I saw a couple of cross-country skiers come along and put up a police barrier to one of the Park entrances , so that they could do their skiing in peace . Everybody has the most incredibly personal response to our parks . People think it 's all theirs , and it is . The day after my appointment was announced , I got forty calls from people telling me what 's wrong at the tennis courts , at the rinks , with the trees . We have an incredible constituency . " He glanced at the paper his assistant had handed him . " I 'm going to hold my first staff meeting in a few minutes , " he said . " And , oh , the Mayor is going to pay us what they call an unannounced visit . The door is open , if you want to stick around . " We asked Commissioner Davis for a quick identification of his two framed photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up one and pointed to a dignified-looking gentleman with white hair and a white mustache . " There is the man I admire most in the world my father , " he said . " He has the incredible title of John Dewey Distinguished Service Professor of Education at the University of Chicago . The others here are my older brother , Allison Stubbs Davis , who is a corporate and trial lawyer in Chicago , where we were born and raised , and my wife , Peggy , who teaches law at Rutgers  --  her father happens to be the Director of the Department of Human Resources ( which includes the Division of Recreation ) in Dayton , Ohio  --  and my daughter , Elizabeth Cooper , and my stepmother and in sister-in-law . And these two little sandy-haired boys are in% nephews . Blacks come in every color . " He laughed . " Often , people THE NEW YORKER do n't find out I 'm black until it 's too late . " He laughed again . " All these guys in the other picture , looking so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once-powerful municipal civil servants  --  Martin Lang , Jim Cavanagh , Harry Bronstein , Henry Rosner , John Lanigan , Tom Roche , John O'Hagan . The picture was taken near the Mayor 's Office in City Hall during the last administration . They 're all special . That is , all smart  --  the kind of guys who really know what it takes to run the city . The kind of guys you really learn from . But there 's also something else here . I keep them here as a reminder . In government , you should n't get too pleased with yourself about what you 're doing . " He looked at his wristwatch . " The meeting , " he said . " But we can keep talking . " " Why do you think you were picked to he Parks Commissioner ? " we asked , following Mr. Davis out of his office . " I do n't know , " he said . " I had n't known Koch , or even met him . I was not at all active in the mayoral campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search committee , I was leading a full , contented life . My wife has her own very Full professional life . Elizabeth , our daughter , is three years old , and we 're committed to spending a lot of time with her . I had been on the City Planning Commission since 1973 ? the only minority member  --  and I had my niche , in labor and real-estate law , with the firm of Poletti , Freidin , Prashker , Feldman &; Gartner . I 've always been interested in planning . When I left college , at Williams , I wanted to he an architect . In those days , I thought buildings changed society . The fact of the matter is , a good architect is a good planner . Still , it seemed to me that the best planners often tended to be lawyers . I got out of Harvard Law School in the spring of 1967 and went to work for a law firm in Chicago . After eight weeks of corporate buy-sell agreements , I knew that something was wrong . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time of change , and I felt I was on the sidelines . One of my former roommates was working for the Budget Bureau in New York , so I came here , rented a tiny apartment in the Village , and got a job working in program analysis . I was a young eager beaver , and one thing led to another . I was exposed to City Hall . Then I worked with the Neighborhood Youth Corps . Then the housing program . Then Human Resources . In 1970 , I worked as secretary to Mayor Lindsay 's cabinet and , finally , as a speech writer for Lindsay . When he tried for the Presidential nomination , I helped write the immortal words for him to speak in Florida , north Florida , ' I 'm for busing , and let me tell you why . ' Parks appeal to me . They 're one of the few places that are genuinely democratic . Central Park , you know , was the first park in the United States to be built for the people . Koch has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to head certain agencies . I 'm honored to serve , but I 'm apprehensive about being drawn into any active politics . I have no desire to give up that last barrier of privacy in m ) personal life . " We followed the Commissioner into a conference room , where a couple of dozen staff members  --  all of them white , except for Mrs. Mitchell , and most of them from one to three decades older than the new Commissioner  --  were seated around a long table . Commissioner Geldzahler was also on hand . " I 'm not going to announce the Mayor 's visit , because it 's supposed to be unannounced , " Commissioner Davis told us . Then he took his place on one side of the table and quickly said that Commissioner Geldzahler was there because Commissioner Geldzahler wanted to keep Cultural Affairs close to Parks and Recreation , even though they were now separate , and that he himself had n't yet had time to see everybody on the staff , because he had been bus ) with snowplows . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally , " he told the staff . " I want to keep the paperwork down . I want more direct communication with all of you . Please do not feel reluctant to pick up the phone and call me up . Now , on immediate issues . As of April 1st , there will he a new attrition policy . The city will replace one for every two . " There were knowledgeable mutterings around the table . " I hope you were n't expecting good news , " Commissioner Davis said . " I 'm going to try to bolster our credibility . But things will be tough , and they will get tougher . We 're not at the point of layoffs . " " It 's all right ! " a gentleman across the table called out , with a wave of his hand which took in everybody in the room . " We 've been through this before . Since 1968 , we 've been through this . We know all about it . " " I 'm sure , " Commissioner Davis    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
