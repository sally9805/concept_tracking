txt Congress drove Friday toward a major showdown with President Ford by tying a delay in his oil import fee hikes to an increase in the debt ceiling he needs to pay for his new economic programs . By a 15 to 14 vote , the House Ways and Means Committee decided to tie these issues together and then voted 19 to 15 to approve legislation which would block Ford 's triple-stage oil import fee boost and would increase the federal debt limit to a record $531 billion thru June 30 . Democrats in Congress were using as their weapon against Ford 's import fee boost a traditionally veto-proof piece of legislation w h i c h must be signed into law within the coming month or the government can not continue borrowing money . BUT , AFTER the vote , Rep. Herm an T. Schneebeli R. , Pa. , the senior G. 0 . P. member of the committee , said he was sure the President would veto this package if it emerges from Congress . The President , Schneebeli said , " opposes the curb on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt limit crisis is expected to develop Feb. 18 when officials figure the existing temporary $495 billion ceiling will be reached . On March 31 , that limit is due to vanish and the legal lid automatically will plunge to the permanent $400 billion level . On Feb. 1 , under a proclamation Ford issued Thursday after rejecting repeated congressional calls for a voluntary delay , a special $1 per barrel import fee will be imposed on foreign oil and petroleum products , With additional monthly increases of $1 until a $3 level is reached April 1 , thus boosting retail gasoline prices . THE PRESIDENT Is pressing for Congress to pass legislation which would impose a $2 per barrel levy on all oil from home and abroad . He has said his action would be rescinded when such broader legislation is enacted . The committee 's bill would block the Ford program for 90 days . Congressional critics of Ford 's action argued it takes time to develop sound legislation in the complex economic-energy field . ALTHO HE ducked a firm answer on whether Ford would veto the measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford " in a way that the President does not feel is responsible , we 'll deal with it . " Nessen said the President likened the congressional move to old-time political maneuvering and feels that the issue " should be addressed directly . " Ford maintained time was passing " without strong and tough action , " which he said he was thus deciding to take . He termed his move the " first step down the long-and difficult road toward regaining our en ? ergy freedom . " HOWEVER , REP . Al Ullman D. , Ore. , the committee 's new chairman , said he disliked the Presidential " hammer over the head of Congress , " altho he agreed the lawmakers should step down the road toward eventual American energy independence . Another committee member , Rep. James C. Corman D. , Calif. charged Ford has " subverted , I think twisted " the authority granted to the chief executive under the trade laws . Republicans and oi 1-s t a te forces urged some compromise . But the committee shouted down an effort to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 against an amendment which would have suspended the President 's action for just 30 days .
