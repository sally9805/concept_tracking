After three years in Siberian prison camps , Writer Andrei Amalrik , 35 , was looking forward to going home . In May he wrote his wife Gyusel in Moscow to say that he expected to be released on schedule later that month . He was mistaken . As soon as his term expired , Amalrik was rearrested and has now been sentenced to three more years for " fabrications defaming the Soviet state " - the same charge that produced his previous conviction . In protest , he has gone on a hunger strike . His friends fear for his life , since he is already in poor health from meningitis and years of eating deficient prison food . <P> The decision to keep Amalrik in prison is part of a stepped-up Soviet campaign against " liberal " intellectuals . Only last winter the underground journal Chronicle of Current Events was forced by the secret police to suspend publication . Gabriel Superfin , editor of the memoirs of Soviet Elder Statesman Anastas Mikoyan , was arrested last month on suspicion of having helped publish the journal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail without trial for more than a year on related charges . Amalrik was flown to Moscow to be questioned in the case but refused to cooperate-a fact that is believed to have contributed to his new troubles . <P> From all indications , his trial in Talaya , near Magadan , 4,000 miles from Moscow on the Asian coast and well out of bounds of foreign newsmen , was little more than a judicial pretense . His wife , who Tass reported had been allowed to attend his trial , was in fact barred from the courtroom . She saw her husband only as he was hustled to and from court in police cars . As for the charge of compiling " fabrications , " that apparently consisted of Amalrik 's notes on his experience in prison . <P> Amalrik has been in trouble with Soviet authorities ever since he was a student at Moscow University , when he was expelled for an " un-Marxist " study stressing foreign influences in early Russian history , and for taking the manuscript to the Danish embassy for forwarding to Danish scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amalrik is virtually unknown in his own country . His two books have been published only in the West-in violation of Soviet law . In the first , Involuntary Journey to Siberia , he gives a spare , vivid account of his exile to a Siberian collective farm for " parasitism " ( failure to hold a regular job ) . Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984 ? is a political treatise that foretells Russia 's ultimate disintegration , and predicted in 1969 that the U.S. and China would reach a rapprochement .
