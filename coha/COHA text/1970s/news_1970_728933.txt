txt The national board of Americans for Democratic Action adopted a resolution yesterday refusing to support candidates who move to the right . The action by 65 members of the 100-member board , meeting in a private session at the Biltmore Hotel , followed arguments over whether the liberal political organization should support Democratic party candidates " already seeking to accommodate themselves " to public pressure for a move to the right . The vote to adopt the resolution , which listed no names , was overwhelmingly in favor although there were some differences of opinion as to whether the action should // apply to every candidate . One name mentioned in the discussion was that of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts . " Look at some of Ted 's speeches , " a board member said . " He gives every indication that he is moving toward the center . Do we continue to support him ? Do we support others like him ? " Another name mentioned was that of Adlai E. Stevenson 3d , candidate for United States Senator from Illinois . Leon Shull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two candidates under extreme pressure to move to the right . What we 're trying to tell them is that they do not have to do so to win . We think such a move is a poor position . We 're not saying we wo n't support them . We 're asking them not to give up their liberal position . " As delegates from various parts of the country reported on the progress of liberal candidates in their areas , some members challenged the idea that there was a nationwide move to the right . The discussion was quiet and dignified , with no member showing any anger , a woman delegate said . Differences Noted The difference of opinion on whether there is a political swing to the right was made clear by a delegate from the , Middle West who said : " If , as we believe , the na-1 tion is not moving to the right , we readily concede that some elements in the Democratic party hierarchy apparently believe that such a move is taking place . " Stina Santiestevan , public relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed because the organization was opposed to an attempt by Robert Strauss , treasurer of the Democratic National Committee , to have John Kenneth Galbraith , the former ambassador and Harvard economists , ousted from ' his position on the Democratic Policy Council . The Strauss-Galbraith argument , she said , stemmed from a letter Mr. Galbraith had written opposing the Democratic candidacy of Lloyd M. Bentsen for the United States Senate from Texas . Mr. Bentsen defeated Ralph W. Yarborough in the primary . A statement supporting Mr.1 Galbraith , which was distributed to members of the board , said that Mr. Strauss , in effect , was asking " that all members of the Democratic Party Council must be loyal to all Democratic candidates everywhere . " In reply , the statement said : " To now adopt a loyalty test requiring liberals to support all Democratic candidates when the party has long rejected that concept even for Presidential candidates would be the height of hypocrisy .

" Those who argued in favor of a continued policy of supporting liberal candidates said they believed that " the Democratic party 's vital majority must draw from the black , the poor and the young and the millions of workers and intellectuals who share their objectives . " s " The great body of Americans feel deep compassion for , not conflict with , the oppressed , " one member said . " We hold that the black , the poor and the young , together with their natural working and intellectual allies , make up a compassionate majority for progress upon which the future of the Democratic party rests . " The statement prepared for endorsement by the board said : " The forces that supported Eugene McCarthy , Robert Kennedy and George in 1968 are not going to accept a party leadership that veers right . " The youth we desperately need inside the political system and inside the Democratic party is not going to accept a party leadership that veers right .
