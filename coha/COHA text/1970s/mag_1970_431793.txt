 | " Teach-In " to Save the Earth FROM ONE end of the country to the other , a new movement has been gathering momentum among our young people . Where once they occupied deans ' offices ? and headlines ? to protest black poverty , or our involvement in Vietnam , or any of a hundred other causes , today they have added a major new concern ? the environment . How , they want to know , can we clean up our dirty air and water , how beautify our ravaged landscape , how control our burgeoning popu-lation ? This concern will reach a peak on April 22 , when hundreds of thousands of Americans , participating in a massive " Teach-In on the Environment , " will protest the destruction of our planet . But the movement has already produced a series o small miracles in college communities around the nation . At the University of Illinois , " Students for Environmental Control " took 30 tons of refuse from a creek near the Champaign campus . A group of law students in the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority to reduce pollution from its buses . At the University of Texas ' Austin campus , students filed a formal complaint against the university to prevent trees being cut down to make way for a new building . Some of the trees were saved . Last December , students and faculty at the Binghamton campus of the State University of New York protested the bulldozing of a unique 50-acre marsh on the " TEACH-IN " TO SAVE THE EARTH III  | edge of the campus ; not only was construction halted , but 30 more acres have since been set aside as a nature preserve . Whether they are burning billboards , burying an internal-combustion engine or giving out " dishonor awards " ( " Smokestack of the Month " ) , students everywhere have shown a flair for spotlighting the issue . At the University of Washington , conservation militants put out a bucket of oil and invited onlookers to dip their hands in it so they 'd know how it felt to be a bird caught in an offshore oil slick . A 19-year-old coed put dye and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if raw sewage was going into Biscayne Bay ; it was . On April 22 , a group at the University of Minnesota plan to march to the Minneapolis Mall , where they will set up tents and hand out free oxygen . Aware of this intense interest among students , I first proposed the national environmental teach-ins in an address at Seattle , last fall . Co-chairman of the teach-in effort , Rep. Paul McClosky of California , and I both expected the response to be good . It has been tremendous . A thousand colleges and universities are expected to participate , along with hundreds of high schools ; civic groups , garden clubs , the League of Women Voters and conservation organizations have also offered a helping hand to make the day a success . Soon after that speech , plans for what students quickly came to call " Earth Day " were pouring into Teach-In Headquarters in Washington , D.C. , nerve center for this massive effort . Some campuses even jumped the gun . Prior to last fall , Michigan had been planning an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March . Dickinson College canceled all classes on February ri so students could hear conservation speakers . San Jose State ran a week-long " Survival Fair " during early February . Biologist Barry Commoner set the tone for the ' leach-In when he gave an address at Northwestern University late in January . " We are in a period of grace , " he said . " We have the time ? perhaps a generation ? in which to save the environment from the final effects of the violence we have already done to it . " The younger generation means to get going now ! Berkeley students plan to march from San Francisco to Los Angeles during April , inspecting pollution along the way and shouting the environmental message . Seattle 's " Committee on Environmental Awareness " has mobilized college and high-school groups and civic organizations in a mammoth " Scavenger Hunt for Visual Pollution . " Stanford University is organizing a house-tohouse canvass in Palo Alto , giving students a chance to knock on doors and talk up conservation . Teach-In Headquarters has made it clear that students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might start with the problems on campus and in the neighboring community . Thus students at upstate New York 's Skidmore College hope to show movies of sewage being dumped into nearby Lake Saratoga . A University of Arizona group will make a detailed study of air pollution caused by local copper smelters , and then follow up with a debate between GASP ( Group Against Smelter Pollution ) and industry spokesmen . So far , the " environmental revolution " has been peaceful . And there is every indication that Teach-In will be a calm , sober appraisal of the problems that confront us . But the growing concern of our young people outlines the need for some radical changes in our national habits . Are we prepared , for example , to make economic modifications in our system to reverse the disastrous trend ? Are we prepared to say to manufacturers , " You must take that thing off the market or prove that the waste it generates does n't pollute the atmosphere " ? Are we prepared to dispose of disposable bottles ? Are we prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars are collected and recycled ? Are we prepared to say to the oil companies that they must not drill offshore ? Are we prepared to develop a landuse policy , to say , " You must not destroy anymore " ? The massive demonstration on April 22 will dramatize these questions . And this is important : in a democracy , people must be informed before they can demand action from their public servants . But the demonstration must do more than inform . It must spark a national commitment to do something . Such a commitment seems increasingly likely . Only a few short years ago there were few political figures interested in environmental questions . Today more than half of Congress is committed to the cause . Last January , in his State of the Union Message , President Nixon himself sounded the alarm . " Shall we surrender to our surroundings ? " he asked . " Or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air , to our land and to our water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Teach-In ? and the growing movement it represents ? offers a dramatic reason for hope . @#
