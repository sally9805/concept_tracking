" I Ca n't Help But Weep " <P> Sir : I am a college student , and I ca n't help but weep for my country . I look around and see my brothers gunned down in the streets . Our " leaders " persist in pursuing an unjust war , and yet the Great Silent Majority remains silent . What does it take to make people see that this country is on the brink of disaster ? <P> GEORGE CRAWFORD Knoxville , Tenn . <P> Sir : From now on it will be easy to kill students , because no one will care . They will read of two of them shot , and it will not be as many as four ; they will harden themselves to the shock value that Kent presented . As time passes they will forget or become immune to the reality as they have become immune to the slaughter in Viet Nam . They will present the same apathetic front that destroyed Germany in the ' 30s , and history will repeat itself . <P> LLOYD CHESLEY Toronto , Ont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the grand finale : " But no one informed the demonstrators that the troops had live ammunition . Nor were any warning shots fired . " Goodness gracious and mercy , mercy . Even the most retarded demonstrator understands that guns are made to kill . <P> May Kent State Professor Charles Brill 's statement , " My God , this is for real , " ring throughout our nation . You bet your hippie wig it 's for real . America is fed up with all of these violent demonstrators . What a great nation we 'd have if just a fraction of this hostile energy could be transformed into efforts to assist the more unfortunate members of our country . <P> DAVID M. YOUNG , D.V.M. Department of Veterinary Pathology Ohio State University Columbus , Ohio <P> Sir : If it is necessary to establish blame for the mess in which we find ourselves , it should be placed on us parents , who have abdicated the responsibility to give our children the direction they need . Many of our generation have gone on our selfish way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings . Then , when our young act like the non-adults that most of them legally are , we are completely shocked . <P> I feel that if we are to continue in Indochina , it should be a declared war , so that those who are so vociferously in favor of it can be actively engaged . <P> It is time we so-called adults accept our own responsibilities rather than to expect it to be a Children 's Crusade . <P> ( MRS . ) CATHERINE HUGHES Missoula , Mont . <P> Sir : The father of one of the Kent State victims is quoted as asking : " Have we come to such a state in this country that a young girl has to be shot because she disagrees deeply with the actions of her Government ? " No one has been shot in this country for disagreeing with the actions of the Government . Persons have been killed and injured , however , for participating in riots and demonstrations involving violence . Certainly the events at Kent State were tragic , but I can not share TIME 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not about time that the Black Panthers , Weathermen , professional agitators , and even college students realize that fomenting deliberate violence carries with it the risk of personal injury ? <P> DALE M.
