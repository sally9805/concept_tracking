First , the good news : President Carter 's friendly persuasion strategy for fighting inflation seems finally to be gaining momentum . Now , the bad news : inflation will probably get worse . <P> The consumer price index for April , due out this week , will be a " disaster , " warns Barry Bosworth , director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability ( COWPS ) . May 's figures will not look much better , he adds , and prices will not start to level out until June at the earliest . Partly because of last winter 's blizzards , food prices climbed 16.4% in the first quarter . Beef has jumped at an annual rate of 41 % since January , and wholesale prices are spurting , meaning that retail prices will continue to rise . <P> The Carter Administration is paying dearly for its past support of inflationary increases in such areas as farm price props , the minimum wage , and Social Security benefits and taxes . " It will take a long time to overcome the inflationary actions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Administration is at last " taking a tougher line on anything inflationary . " Indeed , the President and private business people were pressing the anti-inflation campaign on several fronts last week : <P> <P> The Budget . More than $50 billion in deficit spending is projected for the fiscal 1979 budget that is now before Congress , and both Carter and his Budget Director , James Mclntyre , are under attack for being unable to reduce the volume of the red ink any more than that . Last week Carter pledged to do better in his 1980 budget , saying that new spending will be severely restricted . Meanwhile , the President 's chief inflation fighter , Robert Strauss , predicted that the deficit in the 1980 budget will be " well below " $40 billion . <P> Regulation . Carter 's Regulatory Analysis Review Group made its debut by persuading Labor Secretary Ray Marshall to put off new federal regulations against cotton dust in mills . Those regulations , proposed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , would have helped reduce lung disease among cotton-mill workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Executive Pay . Responding to Carter 's call , several companies volunteered to hold pay raises of high executives to 5% or less this year . General Motors and Time Inc. joined the list . So did A T &; T , after its chairman , John deButts , got a wheedling phone call from Bob Strauss , who typically asks business leaders , " What can you put in the pot ? " Ford , R.C.A. , Westinghouse and some other companies were studying the idea . Meanwhile , the House Appropriations Committee voted to deny scheduled pay increases this year to some 16,000 federal executives earning more than $47,500 . <P> Wages . In its first public blast at a labor negotiation , Bosworth 's COWPS condemned as " clearly inflationary " a 25.5% three-year wage offer that West Coast employers presented to 21,000 pulp-and-paper mill workers . Both Bosworth and Charles Schultze , the President 's chief economic adviser , fear that labor is coming to take for granted annual 10% wage increases . Unless the trend is reversed , says Bosworth , " we might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . "
