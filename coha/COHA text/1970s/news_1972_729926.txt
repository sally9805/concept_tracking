txt It 's cold-shouldered by many of the young American exiles to whom it 's offered , and by the President who can bestow it . It 's embraced in Congress by the unlikely team of a conservative Ohio Republican and a boat-rocking Greenwich Village Democrat ? but precious few others , save perhaps 71 percent of the American people . " Conditional amnesty , " it 's called , and the concept may elbow its way to wide public attention in 1972 ? whether the politicians like it or not . Both houses of Congress now are weighing bills to enlist presidential aid in waiving penalties for draft resisters who return to the United States , in ex- change for two or three years of alternative public service . The number of these exiles ? as many as 75,000 ? could by May exceed the number of American troops in South Vietnam ? 69,000 , as projected by President Nixon 's withdrawal program . In Congress , the politically thorny amnesty proposal won its first fight with eyebrow-raising ease . Both bills were assigned to relatively open-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblivion . It may , or may not , be an omen . " Clearly , amnesty for Vietnam war resisters is an idea whose time has come , " claims Louis Lusky , professor of constitutional law at Columbia University . // *Amnesty-with-strings  --  when ? // More cautious congressional supporters say only that its time is " coming . " They see several signs suggesting that resistance is fast melting : Public reaction . When Sen. Robert Taft Jr . ( R ) of Ohio last month introduced his surprising amnesty bill ( an idea apparently implanted by a constituent and the Senator 's two teen-age sons ) , the first week 's mail from home was vicious . At least one angry Ohioan suggested that the Senator buy " a one-way ticket to Montreal " ( a haven for draft resisters ) . Then the letters became evenly divided on the issue . Now , while pouring in more heavily than on any other national issue , Senator Taft 's mail supports amnesty . Rep. Edward I. Kock ( D ) of New York  --  who did buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exiles there  --  noticed the same turnabout in his mail after announcing that he would introduce similar legislation . His bill , introduced last week , requires only two years of civilian service ( as in VISTA or federal hospitals ) , while the Taft measure imposes three years . Both proposals sidestep the special case of military deserters ? Senator Taft 's by exclusion , Representative Koch 's by omission . Public-opinion poll . A Gallup Poll for Newsweek magazine reported earlier this month that a startlingly large total of 71 percent of surveyed Americans favor some form of amnesty . Specifically , 63 percent endorsed conditional amnesty ( such as the Taft-Koch plan ) , 7 percent preferred amnesty without alternative service , and 1 percent supported the concept while remaining uncertain about conditions . Presidential statements . In November President Nixon brushed off the question ) f amnesty with a firm " no . " But earlier his month in a televised interview , his response had mellowed essentially to " not now . " Mr. Nixon said he " would be very liberal with regard to amnesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and not while POWs are held by the enemy . " Challengers divided The President 's Democratic challengers stand divided over the issue  --  ranging from Sen. George S. McGovern of South Dakota , who favors unconditional amnesty , to Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington , who opposes any pardon . The stance of the President ( and would-be presidents ) looms crucial , for the Constitution reserves to him the " power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States . " But Congress may participate  --  easing the political stigma , and performing such non-presidential acts as restoring renounced citizenship . Amnesty proponents argue that Congress need not wait until the war ends , as President Nixon insists . Senator Taft points out that a resister would win his amnesty only after completing ( under the Taft bill ) three years of national service  --  by which time the war would presumably be over . The apparently growing acceptability of amnesty in the country scarcely shows yet , however , on Capitol Hill . The Taft and Koch bills together have attracted only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican renomination rival , Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr . of California . Organized lobbying for amnesty is limited so far mostly to a handful of church and antiwar groups . Ironically , sizable numbers of the exiles themselves evidently spurn the concept of amnesty-with-strings as penalizing morality . " The government , " one explains , " is the one who will have to admit guilt . "
