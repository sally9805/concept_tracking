txt Every morning when her husband leaves for work , Mrs. Pauline Baker walks the few blocks from her home in Burlington , Vt. , to the family 's garden plot , where she puts in two hours of work . Most afternoons she returns for perhaps another half hour of hoeing and harvesting . The time and effort pay off . With seven to feed , the garden means the difference between eating very well or very indifferently , she says . For Mrs. Baker and thousands like her around the United States the recent resurgence of community gardens is proving a trememdous boon . Vacant town lands , unused farm fields , rubble-strewn city lots , and factory yards are being turned over increasingly , just as they were in World War II , to gardening . The gardens make it possible for city folk , apartment dwellers , and others who would not otherwise get the chance to raise their own food . Interesting pastime Currently 500 community gardens , all but a few having started up in the last few years . are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more if space were available , according to a Gallup Poll that indicated 30 million Americans without land would garden , given the opportunity . They are looking for both an interesting pastime and the opportunity to cut food cost , says a spokesman for Gardens for All , Inc. , the Charlotte , Vt. - based organization geared to bring would-be gardeners and unused land together . In the past two years there has been an explosive interest in home gardening in the U.S. According to the publishers of Organic Gardening and Farming magazine , the number of family plots being cultivated ? back yards and community gardens ? jumped 30 percent in 1973 to almost 11 million . No figures are in for this year yet , but " we think it is likely to be somewhere between 121/2 and 13 million , " says a spokesman for the magazine . In all , 50 million individuals are thought to be actively gardening . Trend confirmed Seedsmen confirm the growth trend . Colleges report that applications for horticultural and agricultural courses are up markedly . The ecology movement and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesome things in life " sparked the trend a few years ago . Now skyrocketing food prices have added considerable thrust . It was food costs that got Mrs. Baker into gardening . With the cash register ringing up higher figures every time she visited the supermarket , she simply " had to do some-thing ! " With no previous gardening experience , she headed off to the Burlington library several winters ago and read everything she could on gardening . Armed with this newfound knowledge , she met with encouraging success the first season and now is considered " a very accomplished gardener , " says Judi Loomis , coordinator for Gardens for All , which established community gardening in Burlington . // *Vacant lots into gardens // The seed industry , expects the spectacular growth in home gardening may be over and that future growth will again be moderate . The outlook for community gardens , however , continues to be rosy . " We have barely scratched the surface of people 's needs , " says Jodi Loomis , pointing to the 30 million would-be gardeners in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 available plots when the Burling-ton project opened in 1971 . By mid-season 40 plots were available , and the following year 544 of the 20-by30-foot plots were under cultivation . Currently there are 651 families gardening on 743 plots . Some , such as Mrs. Baker , are working two plots . This Burlington experience is being duplicated again and again around the country according to Gardens for All ? in New York , Appleton , Wis. , Seattle , and Santa Barbara , Calif. , to name just a few . Old concept The concept of community gardens is almost two centuries old . The British have been at it since 1806 and the Dutch began soon after . In Boston the Fenway Gardens , a holdover from the " victory " gardens of World War II , have operated uninteruptedly since 1942 . But until recently Boston was an exception to the rule in an America where decades of cheap abundance led to a **28;1265;TOOLONG approach . Now a reduction of perhaps several hundred dollars on the season 's food bill is readily appreciated . So are fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and " real enjoyment , " to quote Mrs. Baker , are proving strong draw cards too . Less tangible benefits include new friends , a boosted community spirit , and , for older persons particularly , an end to feelings of loneliness and uselessness . In inner-city areas vandalism , street fights , and thefts have declined with the inception of local gardening projects . Children who once trampled grass now water gardens . They learn , too , that peas come in pods , not packets . Gardens for All , Inc . ( Box 164 , Charlotte , VT 05445 ) is a nonprofit organization that regards itself basically as a clearinghouse for information on community gardening . It has compiled manuals on how to organize a community project , where to find land , who to see , and the like .
