While Jimmy Carter 's political fortunes have been waning , his financial fortune , which is in a trust managed by Old Friend Charles Kirbo of Atlanta , has been doing just fine . Last week , in a public accounting required by the 1978 Ethics in Government Act , Carter disclosed that he has become a millionaire . With assets of $1.2 million and liabilities of $221,000 , including $1,500 in unpaid bills , the President computed his net worth as of Jan. 1 at exactly $1,005,910.25 . That was up from $795,357.74 a year earlier , chiefly because of the rising value of 2,000 acres of farm land that Carter owns in Sumter and Webster counties in southwestern Georgia . The President had a comfortable income last year of $267,195 , including $250,000 in salary and expense money from the Government . His autobiography Why Not the Best ? brought him more than $20,000 in royalties , most of which he plans to donate to unnamed charities . Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter paid $89,805 in federal taxes . They ended the year with $2,554 in U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in savings accounts . <P> According to the statement , the Carter family peanut business , which is 62% owned by the President , ran $73,572.44 in the red last year , after losing more than $300,000 in 1977 . From the thriving family farm , which is 91% owned by Carter , Kirbo made loans of $250,000 to the warehouse and $250,000 to Billy Carter . The farm land that Billy pledged as collateral was promptly assumed by the trust , apparently as a face-saving way to free him from the debt . <P> During the year , the President and his wife received gifts worth $100 or more from 68 donors . Included were a crossbow from Admirer Wladyslaw Adamowski of Poland , a handmade Cherokee Indian headdress from Iron Eyes Cody of Los Angeles , a 32-cassette tape recording of the Koran recited by Mahmond El Husary of Cairo 's Islamic Academy , and a vermeil chain with 62 gold peanut pendants from Frank Sinatra 's daughter Nancy . All of the gifts were turned over to the Government , with five exceptions ; a Norman Rockwell book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Poet James Dickey 's tribute to Composer Aaron Copland , two Cherokee Indian clay pots , 600 to 800 years old , and two brass barometers , one from Kiwanis International and the other from the Naval Academy 's class of 1978 . In such stormy times , keeping two barometers is surely justifiable .
