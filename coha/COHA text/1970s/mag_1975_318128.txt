" We have so much blood on our hands out there . Why do we thirst for more ? " <P> - Idaho Democratic Senator <P> Frank Church <P> " There was a cry for help in the dark of night , which I did not want to deny . " <P> - New York Republican Senator <P> Jacob Javits <P> Once united in their opposition to U.S. involvement in Indochina , the two Senators were now divided on whether to provide more American military aid to Cambodia . The split dramatized the agony among political leaders in Washington as battlefield events in the small nations of Cambodia and South Viet Nam once again troubled America 's long-tortured conscience concerning its role in that distant part of the world . The persistent Khmer Rouge rebels seemed on the verge of final military success as they pinched the Cambodian capital of Phnom-Penh . Communist forces in South Viet Nam stepped up the fighting there to its most intense level since the Paris Peace Accords were supposed to have ended it all in 1973 . The problem for the U.S. was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either situation . <P> The debate in Washington was remarkably calm and reasoned , even though it revived the nation 's receding emotions over its most distressing military entanglement . At issue were the Ford Administration 's request to send $222 million in additional military aid to President Lon Nol 's shaky Cambodian government and , less urgently , $300 million in more arms to the less immediately endangered government of South Viet Nam 's Nguyen Van Thieu . <P> For the moment , Gerald Ford was pressing his Cambodia request hardest , personally telephoning key Republican members of Congress . Only a few years ago , any such relatively trifling request for military funds in Indochina would have speeded through Congress with barely a whimper of protest . Now , while prospects for approval of some limited aid varied day by day , they appeared forlorn by week 's end . The House , in particular , seemed adamantly opposed . <P> Clearly the opponents of aid to Cambodia were more aggressive . Generally they insisted that Lon Nol 's forces were doomed with or without U.S. aid , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome and that the U.S. had neither a vital interest nor a commitment to either side in Cambodia 's internal fighting . Defenders of aid echoed Ford 's claim that the funds were needed to sustain the government troops until the rainy season , when a negotiated settlement could be sought , thus avoiding a " bloodbath " that might be inflicted by rampaging rebels . The Administration had also argued that failure to help a friendly government , even in a losing cause , would undermine faith in the U.S. from other allies elsewhere in the world . <P> Ford had been forewarned that his aid requests faced an uphill struggle . A Gallup poll released last week reinforced that feeling ; it showed that 78% of those polled opposed more aid for either Cambodia or South Viet Nam . Nevertheless , Ford received two pleasant surprises as the Congress began processing his Cambodia proposal . By identical squeak-through margins of 4 to 3 , a subcommittee in each chamber kept the notion of some kind of aid to Cambodia alive .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
