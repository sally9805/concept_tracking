THE SATURDAY NIGHT SPECIAL and Other Guns with Which Americans Won the West , Protected Bootleg Franchises , Slew Wildlife , Robbed Countless Banks , Shot Husbands Purposely and by Mistake and Killed Presidents-Together with the Debate over Continuing Same by ROBERT SHERRILL 352 pages . Charterhouse. $8.95 . <P> There might as well be a magazine called Playgun to offer forthright celebration of America 's steamy relationship with firearms . Such a publication might eliminate the need to justify all that noisy discharge of lead at tin cans , clay pigeons and passing cars that is so dyed-ih-the-Dacron American . There might even be a centerfold featuring the latest model that has come to the big city for the exciting night life-but ultimately , of course , would like to settle down as a policeman 's side arm . <P> Why not ? When it comes to guns , anything is possible in what Polemicist Robert Sherrill ( The Accidental President , The Drugstore Liberal ) calls " a phantasmagoria of roscoes . " Although the U.S. has no corner on the world 's violence , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissatisfactions with such destructive results . A few random examples , courtesy of Sherrill 's research : Dateline New York . Two youths ask a shopkeeper for apple pie . He offers them Danish pastry instead and is shot dead . Ohio . An engineer living near an Air Force base tattoos a number of bomb-laden B-52s with his deer rifles to protest their takeoffs over his house . California . A Glendale landlady loses an argument with a tenant when he shoots her with a German antitank weapon . <P> Sherrill 's statistics are less amusing . Each year 20,000 Americans die by gunfire ( murder , accidents , suicides ) , a rate 35 times higher than England 's or Germany 's . Half of the 60 million households in the U.S. harbor one or more guns . These plus military and police weapons add up to 200 million firearms - 50 million more than when John Kennedy was killed with a $19.95 used rifle imported from Italy . <P> Knocking off U.S. Presidents has always been a cut-rate , do-it-yourself operation . Fanatics may be willing to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains that from John Wilkes Booth to Lee Harvey Oswald , as Sherrill reckons it , the total cost of all the guns used to kill Lincoln , Garfield , McKinley and Kennedy was under $75 . Like the vote , the cheap gun is a great leveler . <P> This is particularly true of the illfamed Saturday Night Specials , those $25-and-under , small-caliber imported handguns that are flooding our cities at a rate of 2,000,000 a year . They are being used increasingly in muggings , holdups and the random , senseless murders of strangers , which are also on the rise . The 1968 Federal Gun Control Act banned the import of many of these so-called " junk guns . " But under pressure from various gun lobbyists , the landing of gun parts was not stopped . This led naturally to the profitable gun-assembly business .
