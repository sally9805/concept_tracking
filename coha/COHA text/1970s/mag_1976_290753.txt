Look at Ourselves and Laugh <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Doonesbury Feb. 9 is the best thing to come out of Yale since the lock . <P> Alan Gray <P> Neptune City , N.J. <P> <P> Wrong Yale . The lock was named after Linus Yale Jr. , who invented it in 1865 . <P> <P> Trudeau 's satire enables us to look at ourselves and laugh . Any paper that cuts out Doonesbury cuts out a part of American life . <P> <P> Mike Murphy <P> Houston <P> It is refreshing to read a funny political cartoon that hits between the ears instead of below the belt . <P> <P> Alan Albright <P> San Antonio <P> Garry Trudeau 's eating habits are not the signs of an eccentric cartoonist , but merely the eating habits of an un married college student . In my own apartment here at Cal State Fullerton you will find 13 empty bottles of Dr Pepper , six Swanson TV dinners , and in the freezer an open can of orange juice concentrate with a spoon in it . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caucus is whose favorite Trudeau character ? Ms. Caucus is a menopausal potato , clearly modeled on Sarah Moore . <P> <P> Nolan Nix Denver <P> Zonker " flaky " ? Only " a spaghetti-haired specimen of the drug culture " ? Zonker Harris is the most appealing character of Doonesbury 's world , the most fully developed character , and ( one suspects ) in personality the alter ego of <P> Garry Trudeau . Zonker lives ! <P> <P> Helen Moak <P> Philadelphia <P> If that 's an example of Doonesbury humor , I 'm glad I leave the comic strips to kids and liberals . <P> <P> Donald F. Hinds <P> Grand Rapids <P> I learn more about government in Doonesbury than in school . <P> <P> David Foster <P> Weston , Conn . <P> <P> Is TIME changing to a comic book ? <P> Paul Trimakas <P> Charlotte , N.C. <P> <P> Trudeau 's use of repeated backgrounds , a cinematographic technique , lets characters develop and philosophies emerge because the sets never upstage the actors and the message . I think any film director would be delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in only four frames . Try it some time . <P> <P> Anne Bonney <P> New York City <P> God as Guide , Not Pal <P> Anyone who thinks a new prayer book Feb. 9 will help us Anglicans should attend his nearest Roman Catholic Church next Sunday to see what a mess they made of their English translation . There are plenty of churches around for the semiliterate . Suppose somebody had tried to make Shakespeare or John Donne more readable . <P> <P> Peter B. Weber <P> Schenectady , N. Y. <P> <P> For many Episcopalians , the language of their rituals is not a barrier to a meaningful relationship with God , but a beautiful , expressive key to that relationship . Brevity and blandness are not better ; I want God as my guide , not my pal . <P> <P> Leanne Wade Beorn <P> Blacksburg , Va . <P> <P> Fitness Report <P> Thanks to TIME 'S medical assessment of the presidential candidates Feb. 9 , we now know much , much more than we could ever care to know - and certainly more than we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Oak Park , Mich . <P> <P> It made my day to find out that Senator Jackson is allergic to adhesive tape . <P>
