txt The British Embassy was destroyed by firebombing tonight as the Irish Republic observed a day of national mourning for the 13 persons killed in Northern Ireland by British soldiers . A force of 200 Dublin police . men stood by helplessly and the fire brigade could not get past the surging crowd in Merrion Square to save the 18th-century Georgian building . Before the fire started , stones were thrown , with encouragment from the crowd . Every stone that hit the embassy windows elicited great cheers , but because the panes were bullet . proof the stones bounced back . Then gasoline bombs flew , at first sporadically . Each flash was greeted by the crowd with . excited shouts of " More ! " More ! More ! " Vows of Vengeance In Londonderry , in the British-controlled province in the north , where British troops killed the 13 persons during a civil-rights demonstration Sunday , thousands of members of the Roman Catholic community , weeping and vowing vengeance , bade them an anguished farewell . Page 14 . In the Republic of Ireland so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister John Lynch may have difficulty controlling them . Last week the Government seemed to be steeling itself , ' in view of British criticism that it was doing nothing , to deal with the militants seeking a united Ireland . This week the political will seems to have weakened . The Irish Ambassador in London , Dr. Donal O'Sullivan , has been temporarily withdrawn . There is a general feeling of hopelessness that any understanding on Northern Ireland can be reached by the British and Irish Governments . British Envoy Returns The British Ambassador , Sir John Peck , returned to Dublin tonight after consultations in London . He is to see Mr. Lynch tomorrow . All the embassy staff were evacuated this morning as a precaution following two days of bombing . The Irish Government , in a statement issued tonight in reply to a protest from London , asserted that it accepted full responsibility for the loss of the embassy and would pay compensation . As Ireland . gave herself over to observance of the day of mourning , a vast march , organized by the trade unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took more than an hour to go through the center of Dublin . It was peaceful until it reached the embassy . The marchers carried 13 coffins and hundreds of placards proclaiming opposition to British control of neighboring Northern Ireland . Some were inscribed " British murderers . " " British out , north and south ! " the crowd chanted . The crudely made mock coffins were handed over the heads of the demonstrators to the entrance of the embassy building , already blackened and smashed by a bomb last night . For an hour the crowd waited , occasionally singing " We Shall Overcome " and " We Shall Not Be Moved . " It watched as young men burned the Union Jack and an effigy of a pig . There were too many demontrators for the police to control , so they stood impassively about 30 yards from the embassy entrance . The fire started after three young men climbed onto the balcony of an adjoining building and made their way to the embassy . One of them hoisted an Irish tricolor to the halfstaff position as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hack at the bulletproof windows . Eventually the glass broke and he was able to get into the embassy . That was the signal for a hail of gasoline bombs and red flares . The fire quickly took hold as the crowd roared . At least four fire trucks tried to reacts the building from the bank but failed . A fire brigade spokesman said that because of the crowd there had been no ' effective firefighting . The embassy fire was not the only violent episode , Late last night a British insurance company 's branch office in a Dublin suburb was destroyed by bombs and fire . Early today windows in three British-owned shops and a travel agency in the center of Dublin were smashed and an attempt was made to burn the Royal Air Force club . In observance of the day shops , offices , schools and'factories were closed , few buses or trains ran and all Irish Airlines craft were grounded during the Londonderry funerals .                    @
