Calvin Hill , running back for the Dallas Cowboys , sat watching the Super Bowl on TV last January with thoroughly unmixed Demotions . Though he had just been named the National Football League 's Rookie of the Year , he was rooting wholeheartedly for the Kansas City Chiefs , champions of the rival American Football League , to trounce the N.F.L. 's Minnesota Vikings . His reasons transcended league allegiance . Hill is black ; the Chiefs are the first team in the history of major league football with more black players than white . It was a source of great pride to Hill that the Chiefs , 13-point underdogs , soundly walloped the Vikings , 23 to 7 , to become the new world champions . <P> Hill is part of a vast black rooting section . He was born in 1947 , the year that Jackie Robinson was accepted by the old Brooklyn Dodgers , thereby becoming the first black man to break the color barrier in modern professional sports .

Fullback-turned-Actor Jim Brown has formed the United Athletic Association to help such stars as the Cleveland Browns ' Leroy Kelly get their just due . Three seasons ago , though he had succeeded Brown as the N.F.L. 's leading ground gainer , Kelly was earning only $21,000 a year . The following season the U.A.A. negotiated a new contract for Kelly that will pay him $320,000 over four years .
