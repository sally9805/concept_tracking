txt Letters pg . 18 Letters On Checking Accounts and Fed Membership To the Editor : Your July 5 editorial on pending banking legislation calls for comment . Readers of that editorial might gain the impression that the Federal Reserve Board is lukewarm in its support of the extension of negotiated orders of withdrawal NOW-account authority on a nationwide basis . That is decidedly not the case . Recent experience in New England has convinced us that NOW 's ? which are essentially checking accounts paying interest ? yield substantial benefits to consumers , and we are most desirous that people in all parts of the country enjoy those benefits . It is important , however , that the extension of NOWaccount authority be achieved with minimal , disturbance to our banks . As your editorial notes , member banks of the Federal Reserve System suffer a cost disadvantage vis- ? - vis nonmembers because of the more onerous burden of reserve requirements . That cost disadvantage has been causing banks  --  particularly smaller banks ? to withdraw from the System in recent years . This trend has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of NOW accounts Speeding Summonses No Bar to Accidents To the Editor : In the June 25 issue of The Times the article on the new radar equipment to be acquired by the Police Department contained the old police myth that speeding , per se , causes accidents and therefore by issuing summonses for speeding , accidents will be reduced . What we have here is one non sequitor followed by another . The supposed correlation between the number of summonses issued and the number of accidents proves nothing . There might be a similar correlation between the number of bananas consumed and accidents . Speeding is more likely to cause accidents when accompanied by any of the following activities which can be causative of accidents even when speed is not involved : 1 . weaving in and out of traffic ; 2. tailgating ; 3. driving while intoxicated ; 4. imbibing from a beer can or bottle while driving , a recent development ; 5. changing lanes without signaling . In order to apprehend these violators the officer must get off his comfortable fixed position and become mobile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of having *two officers at each of 16 fixed positions , waiting for violators , we would have the advantage of 32 officers actively seeking them out . Otherwise it would appear that an increase in the number of speeding summonses issued would do more for revenues than for accident prevention . SOL P. MERKIN Rockaway Park , N.Y. , July 1 , 1977 The writer is a member of the New York Bar and a retired lieutenant of the New York Police Department . For the Death Penalty To the Editor : The hijacking of the bus and the wanton killing of two innocent persons should cause Governor Carey to reconsider his position on capital punishment . Murderers must know that if they take a life , they will certainly lose theirs . EPHRAIM LEEMAN Bronx , N. Y. , July 5 , 1977 Becoming a Statistic To the Editor : Suddenly , on June 30 at 4 P.M. , I became a statistic . I 've been crying a lot since then . But that 's childish . I 've been a statistic from birth . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while collecting my mail , thrown to the ground like so much garbage ana having my purse snatched has got me down .

Since the introduction of NOW accounts in New England , bankers , lave become more cost conscious and the erosion of membership has proceeded faster in that region than in the rest of the nation . In the twelve months ending in May 1977 , almost one-fifth of all banks that left the system were located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about 3 percent of system membership . This is telling evidence that nationwide NOW-account authority ? if unaccompanied by measures to lighten the burden of membership  --  could greatly speed withdrawals throughout the country . That makes it vital to couple extension of NOW-account authority with action to alleviate the burden of membership . Further aggravation of conditions that already create a bias in favor of membership withdrawals could have serious consequences . I am concerned that the execution of monetary policy would become less precise . Other things trouble me still more . Provision of lender-of-last-resort facilities was a critical reason for establishing the To the Editor : I am writing to you as a concerned citizen and businessman , because I feel that under today 's circumstances there should be drastic adjustments in regard to capital gains taxes if business is to be stimulated to make the long-term investments that are so necessary to the well-being of our economy . When the tax was first proposed , currencies held their value in terms of purchasing power , so that it was a fair tax . Today , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens to a holder of 100 shares of common stock which was purchased ten years ago at $100 a share . The real value in terms of purchasing power of that original $100 investment has shrunk under today 's inflationary impact to a worth of approximately 50 percent of the original price , so that if the holder were to sell his stock at double the price , namely $200 a share , he would only break even in terms of actual value . To make matters worse , the poor ' individual would be forced to pay a tax of approximately 50 percent , considering Federal and state capital gains taxes , on his fictitious gain . This is confiscation , not a tax on profit . Robert Toth Explains Refuseniks ' Role To the Editor : My main reason for writing this is to thank you , sincerely , for your editorial on my behalf when I was being interrogated by ' the Soviet K.G.B . in Moscow , June 14 and 15 . Secondly , a comment on Leonid Tarrassuk 's letter ( June 27 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of my articles in the Los Angeles Times on details of my detention and interrogation and on why it may have happened , before he wrote his letter . I will only say that Anatoli Shcharansky and I had agreed , when his arrest was a high probability , that he would openly describe help he gave to Western newsmen , including myself , since he had done nothing illegal and his only purpose was to facilitate his exit from the Soviet Union and that of other refuseniks , as well . Finally , your " Notes on People " column today contains an error . Shcharansky was not the author of the parapsychology article . Also , my comment about the Soviets acting stupidly was summing up my belief that they do not appreciate the depth of support here for Shcharansky or the likely response of the American Jewish community if they mount a spy trial accusing him of treason . That was unfortunately juxtaposed with what I replied to a question about operating conditions for journalists ? that one sometimes felt protected by the belief that the Soviets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapes or making composite pictures  --  and would " get " you on one pretext or another if they wanted . ROBERT C. TOTH Washington , June 29 , 1977 Federal Reserve System . I do not like to contemplate the ultimate consequences of having fewer and fewer banks enjoy ready access to the System 's discount window . The accelerating trend in that direction endangers the safety and soundness of our banking system , particularly since more than a few of the departing banks lack financial strength . I am also deeply concerned about having the exodus of smaller banks continue and of the Federal Reserve becoming a central bank whose members are mainly the larger banks . In the public 's mind , the Federal Reserve would then be seen as a big bankers ' bank . That would generate disenchantment with the System . In time , the System 's independence , which has served the nation well , would diminish if not entirely end . I hope these brief comments will serve to indicate that the linkage between NOW accounts and the membership burden deserves more searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BURNS Chairman , Federal Reserve Board Washington , July 7 , 1977 It is not only totally unfair but , even more important , acts as a deterrent to long-term investment in business , a time when such investment is absolutely essential to the well-being of the economy . What I am now suggesting is a change in the law , so that a fair allowance can . be made to offset the harm now being done by this fictitious type of bookkeeping . Not only in most of the new wage labor contracts being made today is there a clause in which wages are raised in relation to the price indices of the Department of Commerce , but even in Congress a bill has been proposed that the same type of indexing be applied to congressional salaries . In other words , the original purchase price of a given security should be adjusted , for tax purposes , to the extent that there should be added to the original purchase price an , amount reflecting the percentage increase which occurred during the holding period between purchase and sale . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally intended to be , a tax on actual profit . WM . S. WASSERMAN New York , July 5 , 1977 The writer served as lend-lease administrator in Australia in World War If . V.A . Hospital Patients To the Editor : Your reader Anne Walshe ( letter July 5 ) leaves me puzzled : " Veterans stay in hospitals too long because they get paid to do so . " Her comment is on a Times editorial ( June 24 ) about alleged waste in the V.A . ' s 171-hospital system . She says " Any serious examination of this wasteful system must include a critical look at the practice of remuneration which actually encourages veterans to remain sick . " She charges that " Some V.A . patients make more money by being sick than do the staff who work to care for them . " Let 's be specific about this . The V.A . pays nobody , but nobody , for being sick in a hospital . The only patient who would benefit , indirectly , would be one hospitalized for a service-connected disability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 100 per cent . On discharge , however , his compensation rate would go back to what it was before admission . Congress , in fairness , has provided that in such cases the patient may appeal to a compensation board for an increase in disability rating , depending on the latest medical findings . There are few people in V.A . hospitals fitting this description . NEWTON H.

May I suggest that many more lives could be saved by making it mandatory for every driver to breathe into an air bag in a test for alcoholic content every time he gets into his car ? ALFRED R. WEIL ?
