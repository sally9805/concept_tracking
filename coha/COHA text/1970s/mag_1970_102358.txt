AL EAST // While BALTIMORE ( page 16 ) continued its leisurely stroll toward the championship , the DETROIT pitching staff finally was making noises like , well , Tigers . The 1968 world champions got one complete game from Mickey Lolich and another from Les Cain , who went the distance twice in a row after failing 14 straight times . But the big newsmaker was none other than Denny McLain . He won , finally pitching a complete game in his 13th start . Earlier , he was ejected for the first time ever over an incident precipitated by  --  of all things  --  organ music . // Pitching against the Athletics in Oakland , the combative righthander became irritated , then balked after organist Lloyd Fox rolled the organ while McLain was taking his signals from Catcher Bill Freehan . Complaining bitterly , McLain was shown to an early shower , but in a review afterward , music critic and Umpire Nestor Chylak panned Fox . Said Chylak : " That organist Fox , presumably should have his fingers broken . If he 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // New York lost four of seven starts to hold fast in second place . One bright spot was the pitching  --  and batting  --  of Mel Stottlemyre . In beating Minnesota 4-3 for his 12th win , he knocked in the lead run with a two-run triple . The Yankees ' other hitters have not done as well lately , so the club announced that Mickey Whatshisname will rejoin the team as batting coach . // The fence at Municipal Stadium was moved in this season in hopes of increasing the Indians ' modest home-run total  --  and it has done exactly that , modestly . Of 137 homers hit by CLEVELAND , 94 have been at home  --  including four each inconsecutive wins over Oakland last week . While Reggie Smith of BOSTON extended his hitting streak to 15 games , big Frank Howard of WASHINGTON was complaining " I have n't had any hot streaks yet . " Then he hit two homers to beat the Twins 5-4. // BALT 80-45 NY 69-56 DET 68-57 BOS 63-60 CLEV 61-64 WASH 60-65 // AL WEST // A couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slump and steady their hold on first place . First , Jim Holt , whose average is hanging up there around .250 , hit a two-run single in the ninth to beat the Yankees 8-7 . Three nights later Tom Tischinski ( .182 ) hit his first major-league home run to defeat Washington 4-3 . " I was so surprised and shocked , " said Tischinski , " I did n't know whether to run or walk , go forward or backward . " // Pitchers Chuck Dobson and Catfish Hunter each had his problem for OAKLAND . After allowing only one home run in 43 innings , Dobson gave up three in a row during the A 's 6-5 loss to Cleveland . Hunter was wondering what a guy has to do to win in August . Last season he was 0-7 for the month , this year he has lost three straight . // The old singing cowboy , Gene Autry , opened his mouth last week , and out came a surprising note . Said Autry , the chairman of the CALIFORNIA Angels , " I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This did not set too well with the Angels ' current nonplaying manager , Lefty Phillips . Asked about Autry 's remarks , Phillips snapped : " Everyone has a boss . I have mine . " // Kansas City rehired Manager Bob Lemon and also had a message for his players that sounded suspiciously like a threat . " The future of every player will be affected by his performance in the remaining games . " While MILWAUKEE General Manager Marvin Milkes was figuring out ways to boost the Brewers ' home attendance over a million , his team went 0-for-six and Pitcher Skip Lockwood watched his record drop to 1-10 . Said the undaunted Lockwood , " I 'm learning something every time I pitch . " The most improbable turn of events of the week came in Boston when previously hapless CHICAGO scored 11 runs in the top of the ninth ( tying a league record ) to beat the Red Sox 13-5 and end a six-game losing streak. // MINN 73-50 CAL 69-56 OAK 68-58 KC 48-77 MIL 46-80 CHI 46-83 // NL EAST // Montreal failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a good week . The Expos won for the first time ever in Cincinnati . The victory , their 52nd , tied their total for all of last year . On Friday , in the opening game of a home series against Atlanta , Carl Morton beat the Braves 6-4 for his 15th win , putting him ahead of Cincinnati 's Wayne Simpson as the league 's winningest rookie . And on Saturday night the Expos not only beat the Braves 4-1 to match their longest winning streak in 1970 ; they also drew a near-capacity crowd of 27,037 to go over the million mark in home attendance . // League-leading PITTSBURGH split six starts last week but did have Bob Robertson to solace Pirate spirits . He now has 19 homers in 294 at bats . At that rate , he could hit 35 to 40 homers a season . " I think I 'd help more if I played more , " Robertson said . // The NEW YORK Mets stayed in second , although there were games in which they fumbled and bumbled in the best Marvelous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the general ineptness , making two errors in one game after tying a league record with 54 straight errorless games . // Chicago bombed San Diego 12-2 and San Francisco 15-0 but lost ground in a mediocre week . Bob Gibson of ST . LOUIS complained of lack of sleep , then almost pitched a no-hitter while beating San Diego 7-0 . Gibson has won six in a row and 16 of his last 18 , which is almost as impressive as his .326 batting average and 17 RBIs. // PITT 70-57 NY 66-59 CHI 65-62 ST . L 60-66 PHIL 57-69 MONT 55-70 // NL WEST // Instead of The Big Red Machine , CINCINNATI played more like The Big Red Edsel , as one sign in New York 's Shea Stadium had it , but Catcher Johnny Bench stayed in high gear . His two-run double in the top of the ninth beat the Mets 3-2 on Saturday , and the next day , in a 5-4 loss , he hit his 42nd home run of the year to break the alltime record for home runs by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1953 ) . LOS ANGELES was still a safe 11 ? games behind . The Dodgers won nine of 12 during one stretch , and their .274 team batting average is only a point behind Cincinnati's. // Rico Carty of ATLANTA is apparently in his team 's doghouse . He first upset Brave officials by failing to show up for an exhibition in Columbus , Ga . Then he and Pitcher Ron Reed got into a fight when Carty apparently removed two Little League bats from Reed 's locker. // After finally moving up to .500 in the standings during a road trip , SAN FRANCISCO returned to Candlestick Park and 7,086 fans and knocked off the Cubs 5-1 . Earlier , Juan Marichal ( 8-9 ) topped Pittsburgh 7-4 . Although he gave up 13 hits and struck out only three , Marichal called the game his best performance of the season . " I wish next year was now , " he said . So , probably , does HOUSTON 'S Don Wilson . The winner of 16 games last season , Wilson beat the Phillies 9-1 for only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be something to that talk of a livelier ball . Then there 's the smaller strike zone and most important the lowering of the mound . " Ed Spiezio returned to the SAN DIEGO starting lineup and promptly went wild : a three-run homer to top the Pirates , a grand slam to help beat the Cubs and his team 's only two hits in a game against the Cardinals ' Gibson . // CINN 84-45 LA 70-54 SF 63-62 ATL 62-63 HOUS 56-70 SD 48-79
