When violence was sweeping the nation 's campuses in the late 1960s , a relatively small group of professors formed an alliance to carry the banner for scholarship . Though loosely knit , the University Centers for Rational Alternatives argued forcibly that student violence and emphasis on political action threatened academic freedom , and thus learning Today the students are subdued . But u c R.A. , which now has 3,000 members among ' faculty and administrators on 350 campuses , continues to carry essentially the same banner . Only the foe has changed . <P> The current enemy of general education , according to many U.C.R.A. members , is neglect . In discussions among themselves across the country and at a just-concluded U.C.R.A.-sponsored gathering of scholars at New York 's Rockefeller University , a strong feeling emerged : the threat faced by scholarship today may be more insidious than that posed by rock-throwing students . <P> The vice president for academic affairs at Columbia University , Oriental Scholar Theodore deBary ( not a member of U.C.R.A. ) , raised the alarm as keynote speaker at the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over our campuses , " he said , " it may seem melodramatic still to speak of the ' university crisis . ' " But , he added , a " creeping crisis from the neglect and erosion of general education " is getting worse . According to deBary , part of the trouble is that a shift in emphasis toward more and earlier career training has resulted in liberal education 's coming out second best . <P> DeBary contends that universities should be trying not only to hold the line on liberal education but also to advance it . " Far from holing up in its own bunker , " he asserted , " general education should try to break out into new ground where it can hope to enlist new recruits and find new intellectual sustenance . " <P> For Sidney Hook , a founder and first president of U.C.R.A. , the chief threat to liberal education has been the galloping movement for the abolition of curriculum requirements . A former philosophy professor at New York University , Hook proposes a program of required undergraduate studies that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientific method , historical forces and literature . But he also wants students to learn how to judge what they see and hear . <P> " Is it expecting too much of effective general education that it develop within students a permanent defense against gullibility ? " he asks . " It is astonishing to discover how superstitious students are , how vulnerable to demagogic appeal , to empty show and eloquence . " <P> At the New York conference there was widespread support for Hook 's contention that universities have an obligation to set priorities for their students . Historian Gertrude Himmelfarb of Brooklyn College deplored a " nihilistic tendency " to argue that " all ideas are equal . " Harvard Social Scientist Nathan Glazer complained that the problem in his field is that priorities are always shifting . But even in this most inconstant area of liberal education , Glazer argues , it is possible to determine essentials if scholars will only try .
