FOR PERSONAL REASONS I have been reading with close attention the first ? and possibly the last ? book by Bobby Seale , Chairman of the Black Panther Party . ( Seize the Time : The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton , Random House , 86.93.1 At Yak , where I do much of my work these days . he is the current folk-hero of many undergraduates and some of the faculty . His trial in New Haven for complicity in the murder of a fellow Panther kept the campus in a state of near-hysteria throughout the last term . The students ' campaign to " Free Bobby " was accompanied by a strike , demonstrations , arson , a bombing , and two minor skirmishes with the National Guard , although it resulted in far less violence than most of the Yale community had expected . I had hoped that this book would help me understand what the students sought to accomplish by such goings-on , and why so many had chosen Seale as the object of their adulation . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspect that the " Free Bobby " movement might have lost a lot of its steam . At that time few undergraduates knew much about Seale , or the character of his party . Although " revolution " is a popular word on campuses , I doubt Seale 's kind of revolution ? as set forth in his uwn words ? is exactly what the students have in mind . S SALE 'S BOOK SHOWS an obvious literary kinship to an earlier work : Adolf Hitler 's Mein . Kampf . Both books are a mixture of autobiography , revolutionary manifesto , and the story of the " heroic " struggle of an armed minority to dominate the streets . Philosophically both are based on a kind of perverted Marxism ; today we sometimes forget that Hitler 's was a National Socialist Party , promising all the glories of Communism without subservience to Moscow , and drawing much of its membership from the older parties of the radical Left . Seale 's ideology is less coherenta kind of ragbag of slogans picked up from Lenin , Mao , Che Guevara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is outrage , springing at least in part from real grievances ; the proposed remedies in both cases foreshadow even greater evils . Both are permeated with racial hatred . ( Seale denies this . He claims he is leading a class rather than a racial struggle . Yet he is frank in consigning his white supporters to second-class citizenship , and insists that they obey without question the decisions which are made by the Black Panther leadership alone . He is particularly contemptuous of the liberal intellectuals who provide much of his financing . All whites are of course barred from membership in his party , just as non-Aryans were barred from Hitler 's . ) Both are anti-rational . Hitler 's injunction to " think with your blood " is echoed by Bobby 's appeal to the impulses of Black Soul . Both proclaim a new morality , rising above the restraints of Christianity ; Seale 's chapter on " Pigs , Puritanism , and Racism , " with its discursions on sex and ancient African religions , summarizes his theology . Both try to dehumanize their enemies by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " Saujuden " ( Jewish swine ) ? because it is easier to kill if you believe your victim is really a beast . Both exalt violence , and violent rhetoric , not only as a tactic but as a virtue in itself ? a tonic for the soul of die downtrodden . To Seale , even more than to Hitler , the gun is a mystic symbol of defiance and virility . Some of his passages sound as if they had been written by a lobbyist fur the National Rifle Association . But the differences between the two books are of course far greater than their similarities . Mein Kampf was at least formidable , the work of a mind which was probably paranoid , but nonetheless powerful enough to organize holocaust on a global scale . Seale 's writing is saddening rather than formidable . Again , Hitler never for a moment doubted that he was the supreme leader . Scale describes himself as subordinate to Huey I ' . Newton , the now-imprisoned cofounder of the Panthers ; and seems to recognize that as a thinker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the party 's Minister of Education who jumped hail and lied to Algiers . And how right he is . The mastery of language which distinguished Cleaver 's Soul on Ice is entirely absent from Seale 's writing . His only rhetorical resource is a few weary obscenities , often repeated a dozen times to the page . Indeed , the term " writing " may be an exaggeration here ; the book sounds more like a collection of hastily dictated notes , shuffled into some kind of order by a publishing-house editor . S HE TELLS IT , Seale became Chair2Anari almost by chance . In the fall of 1966 , when he and Newton were both working at administrative jobs in the Oakland poverty program , they decided to organize their party . One evening in the poverty program office they drafted a ten-point platform . " Huey himself articulated it word for word , " Scale writes . " All I made were suggestions . " They then " took all the paper we needed out of the poverty program supplies . " Newton pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and asked Bobby , " What do you want to be ? Chairman or Minister of Defense ? " " Does n't make any difference to me , " Seale said . " What do you want to be ? " " I 'll be Minister of Defense , " Newton said , " and you 'll be the Chairman . " This self-awarded mandate was enough , they felt , to make them the only true spokesmen for American blacks . Seale ca n't find a good word to say for any Negro outside the party ? including James Forman , who served briefly as the Panthers ' Minister of Foreign Affairs , and Stokely Carmichael. who was for a short time designated their Prime Minister . ( " My analysis of it is that Stokely is an opportunist . " , His bitterest scorn is reserved for the members of Ron Karenga 's US organization in Los Angeles ( " pigs , black racists cultural nationalists ... enemies of the people " ) . They are responsible , he claims , for the death of Bunchy Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about which organization would get control of a black-oriented program at UCLA , and its $20-000 directorship . Such internecine strife is of course characteristic of extremist movements of both Left and Right . History is full of examples : both Marxists and Nationalists in pre-Hitler Germany , the factions of the Old Left of the Thirties in this country , the current splintering of SDS and the chronic rivalry of America 's innumerable Way Out Rightist outfits . But among black militants the infighting is especially savage , because they see a vision of patronage , power , and fat wads of cash for whoever grabs control of a local poverty program or a black-studies setup in any university . SEIZE THE TIME has a few comic passages , such as the story of The Red Books . When Newton read in the papers that The Red Book ? Quotations from the Chairman , Mao Tse-tuns ; ? was a big deal in the Chinese Cultural revolution , he said , " You know what ? I know how we can make some money to buy some guns . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that many brothers on the block would not even buy a Red Book , but I do know that many of those leftist radicals at Berkeley will buy The Red Book . " So Newton and Seale hustled down to the China I Iook Store in San Francisco , bought out its entire stock of Red Books at thirty cents per copy , and sold them at the University of California campus for a dollar . Within a few w hours this neat capitalist specula. tion brought in a $170 profit , which they used to buy their first shotguns . Apparently this was the first of many incidents which confirmed Bobby 's conviction that white liberals are a hunch of patsies . In the beginning the chief purpose of the Panthers was to combat the police , whom they regarded as an " army of occupation " which was " terrorizing " the ghetto . From their point of view , they had considerable justification . The police force in Oakland , where the party originated , was a notoriously tough one with little training in race relations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspects in the high crime-rate areas , without too much regard to legal niceties . And most of the Panthers ' early members , including Newton and Seale , had police records ; some . such as Cleaver , had served considerable time . Even today the party probably has less than two thousand members throughout the country , because the overwhelming majority of adult , lawabiding blacks want no part of it . One black businessman , who asked me not to use his name , insists that " the Panthers are n't a party at all . They are just a gang of hoods , a sort of black Mafia , who have pretty well succeeded in terrorizing a good part of the black community , but have n't made enough real converts to amount to anything . " He may have been a mite prejudiced because , as Seale explains , the Panthers are just as determined to destroy black capitalists as white . In their early days the main activity of the Oakland Panthers was " patrolling the pigs . " A car full of Panthers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car around the streets until the officers stopped to see what was up . Then the Panthers would produce the lawbook they always carried with them , and inform the police that they had a constitutional right to bear arms , and to refuse under the Fifth Amendment to answer questions . Confrontations sometimes resulted . Seale tells of one police . man who reached into the car and grabbed Huey Newton 's shotgun . Newton " kicked him in the belly , shoving him all the way out of the car .... The pig looked up and looked around , and Huey P. Newton was standing there saying , Now , who in the hell do you think you are , you big rednecked bastard , you rotten fascist swine , you bigoted racist ? You come into my car , trying to brutalize me and take my property away from me . Go for your gun and you are a dead pig . ' The pig folded his hands up . By this time I 'd gotten out of the ear on the other side , put the .45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as Huey finished saving what he had to say , little Bobby jumped out of the back of our car and jacked a round off in the M-1 .... This pig was scared . " Eventually one such encounter resulted in the death of a policeman and Newton 's conviction for manslaughter ; Little Bobby Hutton was killed in another . In several cities policemen were killed or wounded in ambushes which they attributed to the Panthers , and in Chicago two Panthers died in a police raid which never has been satisfactorily explained . Most of the party 's original leadership is now dead , in jail , or in exile . When Newton called for " revolu ? tionary struggle with guns and force , " he ignored one of Lenin 's basic teachings : do n't start the revolution until you have a chance of success . Some of the goals of the revolution , as proclaimed by Newton and Seale , are arson in the law library , the bombing of the ice rink , and the efforts to provoke violence during the May Week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anyone else . Even the Black Coalition of New Haven , a group of some forty community organizations , denounced " white radicals " who were " interested in confrontation for its own sake ... frantically and selfishly seeking personal psychological release . " A larger - number of romantic revolutionists saw Bobby as a hero-figure , a putative successor to the sainted Che . They knew little about him or his program ? but romantic heroes are scarce these days , and if you need one you have to manufacture him out of the material at hand and defend him at all costs . At one of the frequent mass meetings a law student made the charming proposal that everybody present should he allotted a number , and that each following day the person whose number was drawn would give his life in support of the Panthers . He did not explain how this martyrdom was to be areoruplished , but left no doubt about his yearning to " die like a Panther , die like a man . " Calmer heads at that rally merely insisted that " Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and demanded that the university donate $500,000 to the Panther Defense Fund . A STILL LARGER PERCENTAGE seemed 1 . to take their cue from the university Chaplain , the Reverend William Sloane Coffin . Jr. , who revealed in one of his typically with-it but ambiguous sermons that " it might be legally right but morally wrong for this trial to go forward . " He argued that " in the eyes of God all of us conspired to bring on this tragedy ? law-enforcement agencies by their illegal acts against the Panthers , and the rest of us by our immoral silence in the face of these acts . " These sentiments were widely approved by those masochistic liberals ? awash with guilt because they are white , middle-class , and privileged ? who make up a sizable fraction of the Yale University Community . Another group honestly believed that a fair trial was impossible . They took literally the headline on posters plastered all over New Haven by one of the Seale defense committees : " The Fascists already have decided in advance to murder Chairman Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to the antics of Judge Julius Hoffman in the Chicago conspiracy case . Or they misinterpreted the carefully calculated statement of Yale 's President Kingman Brewster that he was " skeptical of the ability of black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the United States . " ( Read in context , this did not mean that he thought the trial should be called off : he was simply pleading for the Yale community to cool it , to avoid " political passion " which might prejudice the proceedings . t Partisans of this school overlooked the fact that New Haven is not Chicago , and that in the early stages of the Seale ease Judge Harold M. Mulvey appeared to be leaning over backward to be even-handed . At one point Seale himself told the judge , " I respect your honor very much for allowing me to have a fair trial .... " According to my horseback estimate , the majority of the strikers probably did not actually expect , or even want . to stop the trial . They did hope , by a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameful conduct of the Chicago conspiracy case . And they were trying to show dramatically their hatred of racial injustice . Many of this essentially moderate group also believed that the trial was " political " ? part of a nationwide conspiracy of law-enforcement agencies to suppress the Panthers ? and that it should therefore be opposed by political demonstrations . Finally , there was a mindless fringe which plunged into the commotion simply because they enjoyed the excitement . It was a groovy thing to do . A SILENT MINORITY ? perhaps 25 per cent of the student body ? either continued to attend classes or left the campus for the period of the strike . Only a few lonely voices were raised in open dissent . Douglas Hallett , editorial page editor of the Yale Doily News , wrote a series of editorials opposing the strike and arguing that the Panthers should have a chance to " refute the prosecution 's evidence and make their own case against the alleged repression by the government . " He was subjected to heavy pressure . including threats , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the News formally endorse the strike . Another brave soul , Glenn Kane , wrote a letter to the News pointing out that if the trial were stopped " we will be establishing the principle ... that the Panthers may not be punished should they , in the course of their politically motivated activities , commit murder or lesser crimes . " But nobody , so far as I know , ever suggested that calling off the trial might be the worst thing that could happen to the Panthers . For if they were exempted from prosecution for a crime committed in the name of politics , then any other extremist group could claim the same kind of exemption . That would be equivalent to issuing a license to murder to every band of fanatics , including the Ku Klux Klan and the Minutemen ? and since the right-wing kooks far outnumber the Panthers , and probably are better armed , they might well set out on a private Panther hunt . Evidently Seale realizes this . even though his white supporters do not . Throughout his hook be puts heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is entitled to under the law . Even when he was working full time to overthrow the Constitution , he understood that it was the best shield he had ; and so lung as it lasted he meant to take advantage of it . Somewhere at Yale last spring ? perhaps in the fake-Gothic halls of the law school ? somebody may have been making the classic argument for trial by jury : however imperfect , it is the soundest protection yet devised for dissenters and unpopular minorities . If so . I never heard of him . Nor was the argument ever mentioned , to my knowledge , in any university publication or public meeting . I had half-expected the Reverend Mr. Coffin to raise it in one of his sermons , since he had been released by the courts in the Boston draft conspiracy case ; but he did not . The eagerness of so many students and some of their teachers to use political pressure to halt the work of the court struck me as the most surprising , and ominous . fact to emerge from the Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they succeeded , similar political pressures might someday be turned against them . Neither did they stop to think that they were , in effect , trying er throw away a right that radicals had fought for from Runnymede to Peter Zenger . Probably most of them never heard of Zenger , since student activists these days generally regard history as irrelevant . For that reason , too , they seem unaware of certain revolutionists who succeeded , a generation ago . in overthrowing their countries ' established governments , and who promptly closed down the courts . They called themselves " fascists . "
