Tim Kraft goes all out for his boss-and wins some friends <P> " You could get a hearing , sure , " says Minnesota Democratic Chairman Rick Scott , describing the White House during Jimmy Carter 's first 15 months in office . " But the guy supposedly listening was always tapping a pencil on the table . Now it 's different . They listen . " <P> This transformation was wrought by Tim Kraft , the Hoosier with a Pancho Villa mustache who two months ago became the President 's chief coordinator on political liaison and patronage . Kraft 's job is to improve Carter 's relations with Demo cratic Party officials and contributors , to help get the President 's programs through Congress and to help get him re-elected in 1980 . Although Kraft is one of the Pres ident 's top staffers , he has re mained almost invisible . White House Correspondent Laurence I. Barrett reports on Kraft at work : <P> His close friend and mentor , chief Presidential Aide Hamilton Jordan , calls him " Crafty , " a wordplay on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37 , has a reputation for directness and reliability as well as a dis arming aw-shucks mien and slow , quiet drawl . Says a White House staffer : " He 's more of a good ole boy than the Georgians . " <P> Kraft also has more of a taste and talent for political detail work than the Georgians , in cluding Carter , whose disdain for party regulars was an asset during the campaign but has been a weakness in office . " Some things were falling between the cracks , " acknowledges Jordan , who recommended that Kraft 's $56,000-a-year fence-mending post be created . <P> To court state party leaders , Kraft has started a series of White House breakfasts where they get a chance for candid exchanges with Cabinet officials-and a chance to see the President . Most of the guests come away impressed . " Sure , it 's an ego massage , " says Scott . " But it pays off . It builds a relationship . " Kraft and his staff of four also try to spot opportunities outside of the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to politicize the White House , " Kraft says , " but we 've got to use the political resources we have better than before . " <P> Thus , when Carter last week went to Texas for a $ 1,000-a-couple Democratic fund-raising dinner in Houston , Kraft added speeches in the districts of two in fluential House members , James Wright and Jack Brooks , to Carter 's schedule . <P> Kraft also made certain that the Presi dent would have a bouquet of good news for his hosts , ensuring a welcome in a state where his popularity has been falling fast . Carter announced that Ellington Air Force Base , which was scheduled to be closed , will be taken over instead by NASA - thereby saving about 1,000 jobs in the Houston area . In addition , the Environmental Protection Agency will grant $6.4 million to expand a sewage treatment plant in Fort Worth .
