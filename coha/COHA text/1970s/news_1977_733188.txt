txt JIMMY LEANED around slowly in the front seat , wearing a sick grin not unlike that of a new husband who has forced down two helpings of charred casserole and has just been asked by his bride how he likes it . Here he was , a rented chauffeur , the helmsman of a black Cadillac limousine as long as a heavy cruiser , ready to shuttle his passengers from canopy to canopy , canape to canape , and here these two clients come out of the RitzCarlton , pile Into the plush back seat , and order him to take them to CabriniGreen . " Ummm what ? ' asked Jimmy , hoping he 'd heard wrong . " Cabrini-Green . The housing project , " one of the men said . " You mean over on Division ? " " That 's the one , " the man said . Close-up With Jeff Lyon JIMMY TURNED his head forward to gaze out the windshield . Women in amber beads and Holston clothes were crossing regally from the Ritz to Water Tower Place . Jimmy thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned around again . " I 'll take cure of it , Jimmy , " said Steve Collura . " Let 's just go . " Gulping , Jimmy put on his liveryman 's cap and started up the huge autoTribune Photo by Yale , Steve Collura mobile . It is only five minutes as the Cadillac flies , if perhaps light years in some other ways , from the Ritz ' to Cabrini-Green . Jimmy ground the ear to a halt in the parking lot of a fried chicken // From page one Squash ' match It was a tight squeeze for Policewoman Kathy Roach ( center ) as she and some policemen got into a pushing match with striking workers Tuesday at the General Dynamics Shipyard in Quincy , Mass . Despite the ? shoding and temperatures in the 90s , some police and workers managed to smile . Roach kept her cool , but lost a shoe. , Actor moonlighted as undercover cop // franchise . Collura and his newspaperman companion got out of the car . As they walked away they heard behind them a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS tall and slim . and he has a Hainan soldier 's face . It 's an 1-know-lhat-guy face . You 've seen it on television , playing button men and hit . men and detectives junior grade . For three years he was Steve , the intern on the daily soap opera " The Doctors . " He is a dedicated actor , resident of West Hollywood , wearer of silver watched , open-neck shirts , medallions , and casual leather jackets the color of English toffee . But now he was walking west on Division Street , toward another kind of soundstagc , one he is equally at home on . For five years , all the time he was being Steve , the intern on " The Doctors , " he was an underecover narcotics detective for the New York City Police Department . They walked a block or two , to where Collura could , see Cabrini 's salmon-colored buildings , row after row of them , and the small coveys of bored men and women sitting outside to escape the horrible heat indoors , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe.a lifetime on their hands . Collura knows these kinds of places , from Harlem to the South Bronx to Bedford-S ? yvesant . They are the breeding grounds of drugs . " All these people hanging out , " Collura said . " That 's how it starts . People hanging out on the street with nothing to do . ' FOR FIVE years he led a double Ile. hunting the dealers , the human hyenas who feast on the desPerate poor . By day he would go to the studio , and put on a white smock and hang a stethoscope about his neck and stand before the cameras : saying things like " Beth , I do n't know how much time Harry has ; we just do n't know that much ? about Hodgkin 's . " And by night he 'd put on dungarees and go " cop " heroin in Harlem . " I worked ' with informers , " he said , " people who were known on the streei : , people who fit in enough that they could steer me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd say ' This is my man , Steve , and he 's a good bro , ' and I 'd talk street talk with the people and pretty soon you get so you 're trusted and you can say to a dealer , ' Hey , man , can you get me two dime bags ? ' and you go into an alley , ancl lie gives you the stuff and it 's done . You take it in for testing , and if It checks out to be real , they Imp in and make the arrest . " Collura had the right background . He Close-up was a street kid himself . He could mim- ' is the nodding , haunted movements of the junkies lie grew up around in Bedford-Stuyvesant , Broeklyn . His acting career was a good cover . No one thought a TV actor could be an undercover cop . Especially a stoned-out TV actor . As a result , he chalked up a record number of felony narcotics buys . BUT THEN the revolving door thing got to him . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea bargain on a lesser charge or he can become an informer . In either case he never comes to court . Here you 're out there with your life on the line , and maybe a guy or two has died in your arms , and the people you have arrested are getting back on the street again before the paperwork is done on the case . " It was one of the reasons he quit the NYPD in 1973 , Now , four years late ? , he 's done a book : " Collura : Actor with a Gun . " The publishers have put him up at the Ritz , a place he says makes him uncomfortable " I 'm tired or ordering steak with French names after it . " He has a point . The Ritz is so snooty its men 's room attendants are.white college kids who. read Time Magazine . Collura says he 's more at home in the streets , like out taking a tour of Cabrini-Green . " Even now , when the studio 's done shooting for the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicano areas , to see what 's going on . I miss the excitement of the street . All the time I was a cop , I was hooked on the addiction of excitement . " I GOT OFF on the danger . I enjoyed testing myself , always taking myself cne step further . The only thing that bothered me was the loneliness . I could n't tell anyone , not even fellow policemen , my family anyone , what I was doing . woud blow my cover . I could n't say to the soap opera crew ' I 'm a little uptight today because tonight I got ta go up to Harlem and meet four guys to buy some heroin . " Why does a man become an undercover cop ? The same reason he becomes an actor . " There 's a thrill in being in a situation and actually being someone else , " Collura said . " Many times I knew I had my gun and could pull it out anytime , but I went on acting like a junkie . When ? you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel superior . It 's a sexual surge . " And when you actually get this ' dirt hag ' dealer who thought he was so smart out on the street , it 's almost like one-upsmans hip . "
