An Early Spring <P> To the Editors : <P> Thank you for the cover story on Cheryl Tiegs March 6 . It warmed up a very cold and blizzard-ridden Ohio State University . It looks like spring break came three weeks early . <P> <P> Brian L. Katz <P> David P. Harris <P> Columbus <P> Though I am a staid and somewhat conservative professional man inured to beautiful women thrust on me by the media , your feature on Cheryl Tiegs moves me to comment : " Woof . " <P> Richard D. Rotberg Skokie , Ill . <P> By doing a cover story on Cheryl Tiegs , you have strapped her into the roller coaster called the American media . I sincerely hope that she survives the twists and turns of that ride with all of her freshness , eroticism , beauty and sensuality intact . She is a national treasure . <P> Peter T. Burgi Westfield , N.J. <P> One only has to glance at the cover of your magazine to estimate how far the women 's movement has come . Not very far . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his mother 's breasts ? <P> C.L. Harmer Washington , DC . <P> Granted , Cheryl Tiegs is striking in face and figure , but do I have to greet TIME with a scissors in my hands ? You could have gotten your message across without the " fishnet " picture . <P> Mrs. Michael Engelsma Grand Rapids <P> Your glorification of Cheryl Tiegs was disgusting , not because of the woman herself , but because you chose to present her as a model of what other women should be . It is not only inane but cruel to condition men to judge women according to the physical standards of a tiny minority of women chosen by an even tinier minority of men . <P> <P> Mariane Pierce Ann Arbor , Mich . <P> <P> With only a couple more birthdays between me and 50 , I find little cause for rejoicing in your assurance that it is now all right to be 30 . Neither am I consoled to learn that my type of beauty ( " narrow shoulders , small breasts , large belly . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katharine J. McNear North Leeds , Me . <P> <P> Federal Jobs <P> President Carter 's reform of civil service March 6 will only bring back the spoils system in a new form . Instead of employees and managers doing their jobs , they will be busy polishing their superiors ' apples . This will be necessary because even today the federal employee knows that under the mask of " merit promotion " lies the current of being blacklisted or being labeled a rabble-rouser for doing his job or for asking that his rights be defended in adverse actions . <P> <P> Wayne Gamache , Vice President <P> American Federation of Government <P> Employees Local 1285 <P> East Hartford , Conn . <P> <P> You fail to mention the increasing demands placed upon Government over the past 20 years , services required by the Congress , Presidents and the people . <P> <P> William M. Gualtieri New York City <P> I have yet to see anyone mention two very important points concerning that " overly generous " Government employee annuity . First , each civil servant has a flat 7% deducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having retired and received an amount equal to that contributed , usually about 18 to 24 months after retirement , the annuitant pays full federal ( and in most cases , state ) income tax .
