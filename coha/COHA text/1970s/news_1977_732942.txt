txt Southern Africa is pulling back into separate black and white strategy sessions ? apparently to prepare for war in Rhodesia . Both sides feel that after the failure of the Geneva conference on Rhodesia there is no other alternative . Southern Africa 's two top white leaders , John Vorster and Ian Smith ? Prime Ministers of South Africa and Rhodesia respectively ? are conferring in Cape Town . But this time Mr. Vorster 's role toward Mr. Smith is likely to be quite different from what it was when the two men met last fall . Then , Mr. Vorster did what the United States hoped he would do : he put pressure on Mr. Smith to agree to discuss with black Rhodesian nationalist leaders a transfer to black majority rule within two years . Now Mr. Von ster apparently sees his only option as backing Mr. Smith in the latter 's refusal to go any fur . Cher in his discussions with the nationalists  --  and more particularly with Joshua Nkomo and Robert Mugabe of the Patriotic Front . The latter were at the Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no likelihood of a durable settlement in Rhodesia unless Mr. Smith reverses himself // From page 1 *War talk rises : Smith 9 Vorster meet and agrees to resume talks with Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Mugabe . This is because ( as the U.S. and British governments see it ) only they can commit the black guerrilla movement to a cease-fire and support of any eventual agreed settlement . But Mr. Vorster is inclined to see Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Mugabe in the same light as does Mr. Smith ? as " Marxist-dominated " and ultimately responsive to the Soviet Union . Consequently , Mr. Vorster would rather preserve the status quo in Rhodesia ? which has a common border with South Africa ? than hasten the day when Mr. Nkomo and Mr. Mugabe come to power there . This ( in South African thinking ) would at least give the South African Government time to tackle its own internal problems , spotlighted again Wednesday by a new outbreak of violence in Soweto , the huge black township outside Johannesburg . ( Reuter reported from Johannesburg that police scattered 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking school examinations . Riot control chief Maj. Gen. David Kriel denied any shots were fired and said only one demonstrator had been arrested . He was quoted as saying : " I. think the trouble is over ? for the time being at least . " ) On the black side in the Rhodesian struggle , recruiting among- - Africans has intensified=-with Rhodesian schoolchildren going across the border into Botswana and with an enlistment drive in South Africa that has netted gardeners and other migrant workers for Mr. Nkomo 's fighting faction . These are also reports of a continuing exodus of South African youths into Swaziland and Botswana , some presumably for guerrilla training . As black ' Africans see it , the U.S. is not going to do much for either side , black or white , in the deepening confrontation . This is thought to be one of the reasons why the U.S. Ambassador , to the United Nations , Andrew Young , was given only a measured welcome in his meetings last week with black African leaders in Tanzania . These laeaders do not expect the Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like . They were aware , for example , that Mr : Young 's statement ( in response to a question about Marxist governments ) that the U.S. would trade with any country carried with it ' the implication that the U.S. would continue to trade with South Africa . South Africa may be trying to buy time by supporting the whites in Rhodesia for another 10 years so Mr. Vorster and his Nationalists can alter their internal setup . Certainly , there is plenty of ferment in thinking along this line among the ruling Afrikaners , the buttress of the Nationalist Party . One idea being debated , at least among white businessmen , is for a super-cabinet that gradually would co-opt certain blacks and Coloreds ( people of mixed race ) to share power over a South African confederation . The theory is that under an autocracy of all races ( with whites ascendant ) , the society could gradually change . The major factor affecting any government strategy is the state of the ailing South African economy . At some point , businessmen argue , South Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of unemployed . If this is - not done , " We will have a French revolution , - said one prominent businessman ? " the hungry will riot and take over . " That is the kind of " war " no amount of weaponry could cope with .
