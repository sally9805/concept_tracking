In a sense it was a stunt , a daredevil adventure that no man who was concerned about his safety and his future should have attempted . But Charles Lindbergh 's 1927 pioneering solo flight across the Atlantic in a single-engine plane that cruised at less than 100 m.p.h. was surely the most glorious stunt of the century-one of those pristinely pure but magnificently eloquent gestures that awaken people everywhere to life 's boundless potential . For most of his life Lindbergh was looked upon as an argonaut of the air age , a Ulysses from Minnesota . When he died of cancer of the lymphatic system last week at age 72 , America lost not only one of its pioneers of the machine age but perhaps its last authentic hero . <P> Lindbergh 's father , a populist Republican Congressman from Minnesota , had taught him to be totally self-reliant- " One boy 's a boy ; two boys are half a boy ; three boys are no boy at all , " Lindbergh fondly quoted him as saying-and the son always had a vigorous contempt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first saw an airplane as a child , Lindbergh spent a year and a half at the University of Wisconsin . Then , unable to sit any longer in a classroom , he enrolled in a flying school in Nebraska . <P> " I began to feel that I lived on a higher plane than the skeptics of the ground , " he later wrote . " In flying , I tasted a wine of the gods of which they could know nothing . Who valued life more highly , the aviators who spent it on the art they loved , or these misers who doled it out like pennies through their antlike days ? I decided that if I could fly for ten years before I was killed in a crash , it would be a worthwhile trade for an ordinary lifetime . " <P> The young pilot barnstormed the country after he finished flying school , offering plane rides at $5 a head to farmers and small-town people .

A natural flyer , with as certain a feel for the whim of his plane as a bareback rider for his horse , he was ineluctably drawn to aviation 's biggest prize : $25,000 , offered by a New York hotel owner for the first successful completion of the 3,600-mile solo flight between New York and Paris . With the backing of some young St. Louis businessmen and $2,000 from his own savings , Lindbergh ordered a plane built by Ryan Airlines in San Diego to his peculiar specifications ; it was in effect one giant gasoline tank with wings , a propeller and a bucket seat . He named it The Spirit of St. Louis , and in May 1927 flew it to New York . <P> Mysterious Chemistry . Other flyers were waiting for the good weather of spring to try the distance . Learning that Atlantic squalls would soon lift , Lindbergh decided to be first and lifted off from Long Island 's Roosevelt Field even before the weather turned .

His route took him up through New England , over Nova Scotia and Newfoundland , past the green southern tips of Ireland and England , and finally over the Channel to France .
