WEEKEND A short story by Fay Weldon B Y SEVEN-THIRTY they were ready to go . Martha had everything packed into the car and the three children appropriately dressed and in the back seat , complete with educational games and whole-wheat biscuits . When everything was ready in the car , Martin would switch off the television , come downstairs , lock up the house , front and back , and take the wheel . Weekend ! Only two hours ' drive down to the cottage on Friday evenings : three hours ' drive back on Sunday nights . The pleasures of greenery and guests in between . They reckoned themselves fortunate , how fortunate ! On Fridays Martha would get home on the bus at six-twelve and prepare tea and sandwiches for the family . Then she would strip four beds and put the sheets and quilt covers in the washing machine for Monday , take out the country bedding , and the books and the games , and the weekend food acquired at intervals throughout the week , to lessen the load  --  and her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing materials ( she was a market researcher in an advertising agency , he a freelance designer ) , and hairbrushes , jeans , T-shirts , Jolyon 's antibiotics ( he suffered from sore throats ) , Jenny 's recorder , Jasper 's cassette player , and so onah , the so on ? ? and would pack them all , skillfully and quickly , into the trunk . Very little could be left in the cottage during the week . ( " An open invitation to burglars " : Martin . ) Then Martha would run round the house tidying and wiping , doing this and that , finding the cat at one neighbor 's and delivering it to another , while Martin and the children had their tea . Martin would catch the BBC 2 news while Martha cleared away the tea table , and the children tossed up for the best positions in the car . " Martha , " Martin said tonight , " you ought to get Mrs. Hodder to do more . She takes advantage of you . " Mrs. Hodder came in twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid her out of her own wages : well , the running of the house was Martha 's concern . If Martha chose to go out to work  --  as was her perfect right , Martin allowed , even though it was n't the best thing for the children , but that must be Martha 's mural responsibility  --  Martha must surely pay her domestic stand-in . An evident truth , heard loud and clear and frequent in Martin 's mouth and Martha 's heart . " I expect you 're right , " Martha said . She did not want to argue . Martin had had a long hard week , and now had to drive . Martha could n't . Martha 's license had been suspended four months back for drunken driving . Everyone agreed that the suspension was unfair : Martha seldom drank to excess : she was , for one thing , usually too busy pouring other peopie 's drinks or washing other people 's glasses to get much inside herself . But Martin had taken her out to dinner on her birthday , as was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprudent . So now Martin had to drive her car down to the cottage , and he was always tired on Fridays , and hot and sleepy on Sundays , and every rattle and clank and bump in the engine she felt to be somehow her fault . Martha 's car was an old estate car , with room for children , picnic baskets , bedding , food , games , plants , drink , portable television , and all the things required by the middle classes for weekends in the country . It lumbered rather than zipped and made Martin angry . He seldom spoke a harsh word , but Martha could detect his mood from what he did not say rather than what he did , and from the tilt of his head , and the way his crinkly , merry eyes seemed crinklier and merrier still  --  of course from the way he addressed Martha 's car . " Come along , you old banger you ! Ca n't you do better than that ? You 're too old , that 's your trouble . Stop complaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're too wide about the hips . You 'll never get through there . " Martha worried about her age , her tendency to complain , and the width of her hips . She took the remarks personally . Was she right to do so ? The children noticed nothing : it was just funny , lively Daddy being witty about Mummy 's car . Martin would only laugh if she said anything about the way he spoke to her car , and warn her against paranoia : " Do n't get like your mother , darling . " Martha 's mother had , toward the end , thought that people were plotting against her . Martha 's mother had led a secluded , suspicious life , and made Martha 's childhood a chilly , lonely time . Life now , by comparison , was wonderful for Martha . People , children , houses , conversations , food , drink , theaters  --  even , now , a career . Martin standing between her and the hostility of the world  --  popular , easy , funny Martin , beckon . ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was grateful : little earnest Martha , with her shy ways and her penchant for passing boring exams  --  how her life had blossomed out ! Three children , too  --  Jasper , Jenny , and Jolyon  --  all with Martin 's broad brow and open looks , and the confidence borne of her love and care . Martin drives . Martha , for once , drowses . T HE RIGHT FOOD , the right words , the right play . Doctors for the tonsils : dentists for the molars . Confiscate guns : censor television : encourage creativity . Paints and paper to hand : books on the shelves : meetings with teachers . Music teachers . Dancing lessons . Parties . Friends to tea . School plays . Open days . Junior orchestra . Martha is jolted awake . Traffic lights . Mar- e , . tin does n't like Martha to sleep while lie drives . Clothes . Oh , clothes ! Ca n't wear this : must wear that . Dress shops . Piles of clothes in corners : duly washed , but waiting to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles off the floor into the laundry baskets . Martin does n't like a mess . Creativity arises out of order , not chaos . Five years off work while the children were small : back to work with seniority lost . What , did you think something was for nothing ? If you have children , mother , that is your reward . It lies not in the world . Have you taken enough food ? Always hard to judge . Food . Oh , food ! Shop during the lunch hour . Lug it all home . Cook for the freezer on Wednesday evenings while Martin is at his car-maintenance class and is n't there to notice you being unrestful . Martin likes you to sit down in the evenings . Fruit , meat , vegetables , flour for homemade bread . Well , shop bread is full of pollutants . Frozen food , even your own , loses flavor . Martin often remarks on it . Condiments . Everyone loves mango chutney . But the expense ! London Airport to the left . Look , children ! Concorde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concorde . Ah , to be all things to all people : children , husband , employer , friends ! It can be done : yes it can : superwoman . Drink . Homemade wine . Why not ? Elderberries grown thick and rich in London : and at least you know what 's in it . Store it in high cupboards : lots of room : up and down the stepladder . Careful ! Do n't slip . Do n't break anything . No such thing as an accident . Accidents are Freudian slips : they are willful , bad-tempered things . Martin ca n't bear bad temper . Martin likes slim ladies . Diet . Martin rather likes his secretary . Diet . Martin admires slim legs and big bosoms . How to achieve them both ? Impossible . But try , oh , try , to be what you ought to be , not what you are . Inside and out . Martin brings back flowers and chocolates : whisks Martha off for holiday weekends . Wonderful ! The best husband in the world : look into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So the mouth slopes away into something of a pout . Never mind . Gaze into the eyes . Love . It must he love . You married him . Salisbury Plain . Stonehenge . Look , children , look ! Mother , we 've seen Stonehenge a hundred times . Go back to sleep . Cook ! Ah , cook . People love to come to Martin and Martha 's dinners . Work it out in your head in the lunch hour . If you get in at six-twelve , you can wrap the meat while you beat the egg whites while you feed the cat while you lay the table while you string the beans while you set out the cheeses ... goat 's cheese , Martin loves goat 's cheese , Marthi tries to like goat 's cheese  --  oh , bed , sleep peace , quiet . Sex ! Ah , sex . Orgasm , please . Martin requires it . Well , so do you . And you do n't want his secretary providing a passion you neglected to develop . Quick , quick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Probably a vulgar suspicion : nothing more . Probably a fit of paranoiacs , a la mother , now dead and gone . At peace . R.I.P . Chilly , lonely mother , following her suspicions where they led . Nearly there , children . Nearly in paradise , nearly at the cottage . Have another biscuit . Green grass . Oh , God , grass . Grass must be mowed . Restful lawns , daisies bobbing , buttercups glowing . Read roses round the door . Roses and grass and books . Books . Please , Martin , do we have to have 200 hooks , even though Victorian first editions ? Books need dusting . Roars of laughter from Martin , Jasper , Jenny , and Jolyon . Mummy says we should n't have the books : books need dusting ! Roses , green grass , books , and peace . Martha woke up with a start when they got to the cottage , and gave a little shriek that made them all laugh . Mummy 's waking shriek , they called it . I Then there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the electricity to connect , and the supper to make , and the cobwebs to remove , while Martin made the fire . Then supper pork chops in sweet-and-sour sauce ( " Pork is such a dull meat if you do n't cook it properly " : Martin ) , green salad from the garden , or such green salad as the rabbits had left ( " Martha , did you really net them properly ? Be honest , now ! " : Martin ) , and saut  --  ed potatoes . Mash is so ordinary , and instant mash unthinkable . The children studied the night sky with the aid of their star map . ( Wonderful , rewarding children ! Midnight . Goodnight . Weekend guests arriving in the morning . Seven for lunch and dinner on Saturday . Seven for Sunday breakfast , nine for Sunday lunch . ( " Do n't fuss , darling . You always make such a fuss " : Martin . ) Oh , God , no garlic squeezer . That means ten minutes with salt and the back of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one . Not Martin 's guests . Martin said so . Sleep . c ? LIN AND KATIE . Colin is Martin 's oldest friend . Katie is his new young mistress . Janet , Colin 's ex-wife , was Martha 's friend . Janet was rather like Viartlia , quieter and duller than her hus ( and . A nag and a drag , Martin rather hought , and said , and of course she 'd let her-elf go , everyone agreed . No one exactly ex cused Colin for walking out , but you could " Nearly there , see the temptation . children . Katie versus Janet . Katie was languid , beautiful , and elegant . She drawled when she spoke . Her hands were expressive : her feet were little and feminine . She had no children . Janet plodded round on very flat , rather large feet . There was something wrong with them . They turned out slightly when she walked . She had two children . She was , frankly , boring . But Martha liked her : when Janet came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way that most guests washed up  --  dutifully , selling everything to drain on the sideboard  --  but actually drying and putting away . too . And Janet would wash the bath and get the children all settled down , with chairs for everyone , even the littlest , and keep them quiet and satisfied so the grown-ups  --  well , the men  --  could get on with their conversation and their jokes and their love of country weekends , while Janet stared into space , as if grateful for the rest , quite happy . Janet would garden , too . Weed the strawberries , while the men went for their walk ; her great feet standing firm and square and sometimes crushing a plant or so , but never mind , oh , never mind . Lovely Janet , who understood . Now Janet was gone and here was Katie . Katie talked with the men and went for walks with the men , and moved her ashtray rather impatiently when Martha tried to clear the drinks around it . Dishes were boring , Katie implied by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered with that kind of thing was a fool . Like Martha . Ash should he allowed to stay where it was , even if it was in the butter , and conversations should never be interrupted . Knock , knock . Katie and Colin arrived at one-fifteen on Saturday morning , just after Martha had got to bed : " You do n't mind ? It was the moonlight . We could n't resist it . You should have seen Stonehenge ! We did n't disturb you ? Such early birds ! " Martha rustled up a quick meal of omelets . Saturday nights ' eggs . ( " Martha makes a lovely omelet " : Martin . ) ( " Honey , make one of your mushroom omelets : cook the mushrooms separately , remember , with lemon . Otherwise the water from the mushrooms gets into the egg and spoils everything . " ) Sunday-supper mushrooms . lint ungracious to say anything . Martin had revived wonderfully at the sight of Colin and Katie . He brought out the whiskey bottle . Glasses . Ice . Jug for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're finished . Two A.M. " Do n't do it tonight . darling . " " It 'll only take a sec . " Bright smile , not a hint of self-pity . Self-pity can spoil everyone 's weekend . S HE IS RUNNING round in her nightie . Now if that had been Katie  --  but there 's something so practical about Martha . Reassuring , mind ; but the skimpy nightie and the broad rump and the thirty-eight years are all rather embarrassing . Martha can see it in Colin 's and Katie 's eyes . Martin 's too . Martha wishes she did not see so much in other people 's eyes . Her mother did , too . Dear , dead mother . Did I misjudge you ? This was the second weekend Colin had been down with Katie but without Janet . Colin was a photographer : Katie had been his accessorizer . First Colin and Janet : then Colin , Janet , and Katie : now Colin and Katie ! On the first of the Colin/Janet/Katie weekends Katie had appeared out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding out a damp towel with evident distaste , " I can only find this . Any hope of a dry one ? " And Martha had run to fetch a dry towel and , amazingly , found one , and handed it to Katie , who flashed her a brilliant smile and said , ca n't bear damp towels . Anything in the world but damp towels , " as if speaking to a servant in a time of shortage of staff , and took all the water so there was none left for Martha to wash up . The trouble , of course , was drying anything at all in the cottage . There were no facilities for doing so , and Martin had a horror of clotheslines , which might spoil the view . He toiled and moiled all week in the city simply to get a country view on the weekend . Ridiculous to spoil it by draping it with wet towels ! But now Martha had brought more towels , so perhaps everyone could be satisfied . She would take nine damp towels back in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . On this Saturday morning , straight after breakfast , Katie went out to the car  --  she and Colin had a new Lamborghini ; hard to imagine Katie in anything duller  --  and came back waving a new Yves Saint Laurent towel . " See ! I brought my own , darlings . " They 'd brought nothing else . No fruit , or meat . or vegetables , not even bread , certainly not a box of chocolates . They 'd gone off to bed with alacrity the night before , and the spare room had rocked and heaved : well , who 'd want to do washing up when you could do that , but what about the children ? Would they get confused ? First Colin and Janet , now Colin and Katie ? Martha murmured something of her thoughts to Martin , who looked shocked . " Colin 's my best friend . I do n't expect him to bring anything , " and Martha felt mean . " And good heavens , you ca n't protect the kids frorr sex forever ; do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . Mean , complaining and stupid . Janet had rung Martha during the week The house had been sold over her head , anc she and the children had been moved into small apartment . Katie was trying to persuade Colin to cut down on her allowance , Jane said . 64 " It does one no good to be materialistic , " Katie confided . " I have nothing . No home , no family , no ties , no possessions . Look at me ! Only me and a suitcase of clothes . " But Katie seemed highly satisfied with the me , and the clothes Were stupendous . Katie had been married twice . Martha marveled at how someone could arrive in her mid-thirties with nothing at all to her name  --  neither husband , nor children , nor property  --  and not mind . But Martha could see the power of such helplessness . If Colin was all Katie had in the world , how could Cohn abandon her ? And to what ? Where would she go ? How could she live ? Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger than Martin , though they were much the same age . " Youth 's catching , " Martin said in bed that night . " It 's since he found Katie . " Found , like some treasure . Discovered ; something exciting and wonderful , in the dreary world of established spouses . 0 N SATURDAY ' MORNING Jasper trod on a piece of wood I " Martha , why is n't he wearing shoes ? It 's too bad " : Martin I and Martha took him to the hospital to have a nasty splinter removed . She left the cottage at ten and arrived back at one , and they were still sitting in the sun drinking , empty bottles glinting in the long grass . The grass had n't been cut . Do n't forget the bottles . Broken glass means more mornings at the hospital . Oh , do n't fuss . Enjoy yourself . Like other people . Try . But no potatoes peeled , no breakfast cleared , nothing . Cigarette ends still among old toast , bacon rind , and marmalade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst out . Oh , bad temper ! Prime sin . They looked at her in amazement and dislike . Martin , too . " Goodness , " Katie whole Sunday lunch toes ? Ages since I 've Full " " The children expect it , " Martha said . So they did . Saturday and Sunday lunch ' hone like reassuring beacons in their lives . iaturday lunch : family lunch : fish and chips . " So much better cooked at home than ) ought " : Martin . ) Sunday . Usually roast beef , ) potatoes , peas , apple pie . Oh , of course . York- , hire pudding . Always a problem with oven emperatures . When the beef 's going slowly , he Yorkshire should be going fast . How to . chieve that ? Like big bosom and little hips . " Just relax , " Martin said . " I 'll cook dinner , 11 in good time . Splinters always work their v ay out : no need to have taken him to a hos , pital . Let life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's the way . " And Martin flashed Martha a distant , spiritual smile . His hand lay on Katie 's slim brown arm , with its many gold bands . " You do too much for the children , " Martin said . " It is n't good for them . Have a drink . " So Martha perched uneasily on the step and had a glass of cider , and wondered how , if lunch was going to be late , she would get cleared up and the meat out of the marinade for the rather formal dinner that would be expected that evening . The marinated lamb ought to cook for at least four hours in a low oven ; and the cottage oven was very small , and you could n't use that and the grill at the same time and Martin liked his fish grilled , not fried . Less cholesterol . Domestic details like this were very boring , and any mild complaint was registered by Martin as a scene . And to make a scene was so ungrateful Martha did n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can of beans and sausages and heated that up . ( " Martha , do they have to eat that crap ? Ca n't they wait ? " : Martin . ) Katie was hungry : she said so , to keep the children in face . She was lovely with children ? most children . She did not particularly like Colin and Janet 's children . He saw them only once a month now , not once a week . " Let me make lunch , " Katie said to Martha . " You do so much , poor thing ! " And she pulled out of the fridge all the things Martha had put away for the next day 's picnic  --  Camembert cheese , and salad , and salami , and made a wonderful tomato salad in two minutes and opened the white wine and had it all on the table in five amazing competent minutes . " That 's all we need , darling , " Martin said . " You are funny with your fish-and-chip Saturdays ! What could be nicer than this ? Or simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch for nine gone , in place of Saturday 's fish for six , and would the fish stretch ? No . Katie had had quite a lot to drink . She pecked Martha on the forehead . " Funny little Martha , " she said . " She reminds me of Janet . I really do like Janet . " Colin did not want to be reminded of Janet , and said so . " Darling , Janet 's a fact of life , " Katie said . " If you 'd only think about her more , you might manage to pay her less . " And she yawned and stretched her lean , childless body and smiled at Colin with her inviting , naughty-little-girl eyes , and Martin watched her in admiration . Martha got up and left them and took a paint pot and put a coat of white gloss on the bathroom wall . The white surface pleased her . She was good at painting . She produced a smooth , even surface . Her legs throbbed . She feared she might be getting varicose veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were bad-tempered , but relieved to be able to look up and see their mother working , as usual : making their lives forever better and nicer : organizing , planning , thinking ahead , sidestepping disaster , making reparations ; like a mother hen , fussing and irritating : part of the natural scenery of the world . An egg and an orange each child , each day Then nothing too bad would go wrong . And it had n't . Ah , smile , Martha , smile . Domestic happiness depends on you . Twenty-one times fifty-two oranges a year . Each one to he purchased , carried , peeled , and washed up after . And what about potatoes ? Twelve times fifty-two pounds a year ? Martin liked his potatoes carefully peeled . He could n't bear to find little cores of black in the mouthful . ( " Weil , it is n't very nice , is it ? " : Martin . ) Martha dreamed she was eating coal , by handfuls , and liking it . S ATURDAY NIGHT . Martin made love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , and clearly turned on by the sounds from the spare room . Martin said he loved her . Martin always did . He was a courteous lover ; he knew the importance of foreplay . So did Martha . Three times . Ah , sleep . Jolyon had a nightmare , Jenny was awakened by a moth . Martin slept through everything . Martha pottered about the house in the night . There was a moon . She sat at the window and stared out into the summer night for five minutes , and was at peace , and then went back to bed to be fresh for the morning . But she was n't . She slept late . The others went out for a walk . They 'd left a note , a considerate note : " Did n't wake you . You looked tired . Had a cold breakfast so as not to make too much mess . Leave everything till we get back . " But it was ten o'clock , and guests were coming at noon , so she cleared away the bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jam , the spoons , the spilled sugar , the cereal , the milk ( sour by now ) , the-dirty plates , and swept the floors , and tidied up quickly , and grabbed a cup of coffee , and prepared to make a rice-and-fish dish , and a chocolate mousse , and sat down in the middle to eat a lot of bread and jam herself . Broad hips . She remembered the office work in her file and knew she would n't be able to do it . Martin thought it was ridiculous anyway for her to bring work home at the weekends . " It 's your holiday , " he 'd say . " Why should they impose ? " Martha loved her work . She did n't have to smile at it . She just did it . Katie came back upset and crying . She sat in the kitchen while Martha worked , and drank glass after glass of gin and bitter lemon . Katie liked ice and lemon in gin . Martha paid for all the drink out of her wages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she went out to work . All things to cheer the spirit , otherwise depressed by a working wife and mother , were to he paid for by Martha . Drink , holidays , petrol , outings , puddings , electricity , heating : it was quite a joke between them . It did n't really make any difference : it was their joint money , after all . Amazing how Martha 's wages were creeping up , almost to the level of Martin 's . One day they would overtake . Then what ? Work , honestly , was a piece of cake . Anyway , poor Katie was crying . Colin . she 'd discovered , kept a photograph of Janet and the children in his wallet . " He 's not free of her . He pretends he is , but he is n't . She has him by a stranglehold . It 's the kids . His bloody kids . Moaning Mary and that little creep , Joanna . It 's all he thinks about . I 'm nobody . " But Katie did n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colin came in , in a fury . He took out the photograph and set fire to it , bitterly , with a match . Up in smoke the ) went . Mary and Joanna and Janet . The ashes fell on the floor . 1 Martha swept them up wher Colin and Katie had gone . It hardly seemed polite to do so when they were still there . ) " Co back to her , " Katie said . " Co hack to her . I do n't care . Honestly , l 'd rather he on my own . You 're a nice old-fashioned thing . Run along then . Do your thing , I 'll do mine . Who cares.77 , They were reconciled before lunch , up in the spare room . Harry and Beryl Elder arrived at twelve-thirty . Harry did n't like to hurry on Sundays ; Beryl was flustered with apologies for their lateness . They 'd brought artichokes from their garden . " Wonderful , " Martin cried . " Fruits of the earth ! Let 's have a wonderful soup ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't fret . " Martha clearly had n't been smiling enough . She was in danger , Martin implied , of ruining everyone 's weekend . There was an emergency in the garden very shortly an elm tree that had probably got Dutch elm disease  --  and Martha finished the artichokes . The lid flew off the blender and there was artichoke puree everywhere . " Let 's have lunch outside , " Colin said . " Less work for Martha . " Martin frowned at Martha : he thought the appearance of martyrdom in the face of guests an unforgivable offense . Everyone happily joined in taking the furniture out , but it was Martha 's experience that nobody ever helped to bring it in again . Jolyon was stung by a wasp . Jasper sneezed and sneezed from hay fever and could n't find the tissues and he would n't use toilet paper . ( " Surely you remembered the tissues , darling ? " : Martin . ) Beryl Elder was nice . " Wonderful to eat out , " she said , fetching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly from the liquefying Brie ( " You should n't have bought it so ripe , Martha " : Martin ) ? " except it 's just some other woman has to do it . But at least it is n't me . " Beryl worked , too , as a secretary , to send the boys to boarding school , where she 'd rather they were n't . But her husband was from a grand army family , and she 'd been only a typist when he married her , so her life was a mass of amends , one way or another . Katie found the fish-and-rice dish rather strange , toyed at it with her fork , and talked about Italian restaurants she knew . Martin lay back soaking in the sun : crying , " Oh , this is the life . " He made coffee , nobly , and the lid flew off the grinder and there were coffee beans all over the kitchen , especially in among the row of cookbooks that Martin gave Martha Christmas by Christmas . At least they did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burglars wo n't have the sense to steal those " : Martin . ) Beryl fell asleep , and Katie watched her , quizzically . Beryl 's mouth was open and she had a lot of fillings , and her ankles were thick and her waist was going and she did n't look after herself . " I love women , " Katie sighed . " They look so wonderful asleep . I wish I could be an earth mother . " Beryl woke with a start and nagged her husband into going home , which he clearly did n't want to do , so did n't ; Beryl thought she had to get back because his mother was coming round later . Nonsense ! " She does come on strong , poor soul , " laughed Katie when they 'd finally gone . " I 'm never going to marry again " ? and Colin looked at her yearningly because he wanted to marry her more than anything in the world , and Martha cleared the coffee cups . " Oh , do n't do that , " Katie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make us all feel bad , " and Martin glared at Martha , who sat down , and Jenny called out for her and Martha went upstairs and Jenny had started her first period and Martha cried and cried and knew she must stop because this must be a joyous occasion for Jenny or her whole future would be blighted , but for once , Martha could n't . Her daughter , Jenny ; wife , mother , friend .
