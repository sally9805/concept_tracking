Consumer Advocate Ralph Nader has long been assailed by conservative politicians and officers of corporations that have been gored by his crusading zeal . At the Republican National Convention in Kansas City , Vice President Nelson Rockefeller made him the target of one of history 's most labored puns ( he claimed that Candidate Jimmy Carter 's appearance at a Nader gathering meant that Carter was trying " to pass himself off as one of the Nader-day saints " ) . Now the lean , intense folk hero is coming under fire from a few of his former admirers-liberals who applaud his service to a noble cause but deplore the way the myth is altering the man . <P> Nader 's revisionist critics claim that his emotional commitment occasionally overwhelms his acute powers of reasoning . In an unusually vivid public display of bad manners , Nader a month ago fortified that claim . Apparently frustrated by resistance to his pet auto safety device , the inflatable air bag , Nader laced into Secretary of Transportation William T. Coleman Jr . during hearings on the subject . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand up to General Motors and the Ford Motor Company as he had the guts to stand up on civil rights years ago , " Nader said bitingly . <P> Coleman , a black who is regarded as a topnotch Cabinet member and no pushover for the transportation industry , sensed a racial slur in Nader 's remarks . Angrily , he termed them " bigoted . " He later apologized . Nader did not , and even the Washington Post , a longtime fan , headlined its editorial WINDBAGS AND AIRBAGS . <P> The burden of the attacks on Nader is that he is something of a tyrant to work for , a lousy administrator , overly secretive and paranoid about his enemies . Some critics suggest , without conclusive evidence , that he lives less ascetically than he claims and that his organizations are wealthier than is indicated by their pitches for funds . Occasionally Nader is also portrayed as a wild-eyed Savonarola intent on forcing his own puritanical concept of the public good on a subservient nation . <P> Ruth Darmstadter , a former Nader staffer writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a band of 60 to 70 dedicated idealists working in happy concert with Nader is , quite simply , a fiction . When you couple Nader 's incompetence as an administrator with the importance of employees remaining in his favor , you have the formula for a poisoned atmosphere . " One dramatic expression of that atmosphere was the mysterious , nighttime removal of a personal diary from the office of Ted Jacobs , a high-level Nader associate , who says he was then fired by Nader for " misconduct .
