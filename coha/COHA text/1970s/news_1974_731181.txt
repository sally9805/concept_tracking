txt President Nixon strives , as inflation  - -  and recession threaten to engulf his 1975 budget , to keep alive his " New Federalism " ? the movement of power and money from Washington back to states , towns , and individual Americans . " Ten or 20 years from how , " declared Frederic V. Malek , - " this movement is going to mean so much more to Americans than the specifics of this year 's budget . " The idea , " continued Mr. Malek , Deputy Director of the Budget , " is not just to move power back to state and local governments , but to move beyond that to giving money directly to individuals . " This concept , he said , " is woven into a whole series of programs embodied in the 1975 budget " ? a record-breaking document , calling for federal spending Of $304.4 billion , revenues of $295 billion , and a $9.4 billion deficit . Roy L. Ash , Director of the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) and Mr. Malek 's boss , puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , the federal government is becoming " a cash transfer agent , " funneling the people 's tax money back to their local communities , to be spent " in accordance with local conditions and community aspirations . " Dramatic reversal Mr. Nixon 's 1975 budget calls for $51.7 billion worth of federal grants to state and local governments , an increase of $3.4 billion over 1974 . On top of this , remarks Mr. Ash , is another $100 billion in aid to individuals , through social security and other human resource programs . Put another way , 54 cents of every budget dollar now goes to individuals and to state and local governments , while only 29 cents goes to national defense This is a dramatic reversal of trends since 1969 , when defense spending considerably outweighed all human resource programs . Mr Nixon 's budget aides do not say , in lauding this trend , that the President in fact opposed the magnitude of successive increases in social security payments , proposed and passed by Congress The White House suggested smaller increments , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be inflationary Now , however , the White House simply folds the higher social security benefits into its claim that needy and elderly Americans receive much more money than they did when Mr Nixon took office in 1969 The magnitude of payments is , however , not the heart of " New Federalism , " as Messrs Ash , Malek , and other White House officials describe it Waste charged Much transfer money , they claim , was wasted M a proliferation of overlapping and poorly managed programs , under the general umbrella of President Johnson 's " Great Society " President Nixon 's aim , symbolized by his General Revenue Sharing concept , was to clear out and simplify the pipelines of aid , so that federal money reached its proper target , the individual Thus state and local governments now receive $6 billion yearly in General Revenue Sharing funds , whose criteria are " minimal restrictions , uncomplicated distribution , and predictable appropriations for five years " Critics charge that , by removing restrictions on how federal grant money must be spent , the Nixon scheme often diverts money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion of local agencies // * Can Nixonomics survive ? // " The person on the receiving end of that money , " declared Mr Malek , " is a big enough person to decide what to do about it . " Extension of this idea in practice , he said , " is a top item on the President 's agenda of unfinished business " for the remainder of his term . This year , however , the twin evils of inflation and rising unemployment may balloon the 1975 fiscal year deficit beyond $9.4 billion and require spending that bears no relation to " New Federalism . " Housing decision The first case in point is the President 's Just-announced decision to stimulate the housing industry by supporting with federal money the construction of an additional 100,000 dwelling units . His 1975 budget calls for supporting the construction of 200,000 units , not the total of 300,000 he now has decreed . As recently as 1962 , the federal budget broke the $100 billion ceiling . In 1971 President Nixon 's budget pierced the $200 billion mark . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So massiVdly has the U.S. economy grown , however , that federal outlays , as a percentage of gross national product ( GNP ) , have remained almost constant for'more than a decade , ? just over 20 percent of all goods , and services produced by the nation . Ninety percent of the increased spending in fiscal year 1975 ? $29.8 billion over 1974 ? is due to " uncon- trollable " outlays required by law , says Mr. Ash , notably social security , medical programs , manpower rants , veterans benefits , and others .
