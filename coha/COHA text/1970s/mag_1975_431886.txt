 | DO-IT-YOURSELF PROBATE-IT 'S HERE JOANNE CASEY , a 42-year-old Greendale , Wis. , housewife , is a minor neighborhood heroine . Last summer , with no legal help , she probated the $50,000 estate of her father ? and saved her mother , the sole heir , more than $1000 in lawyer fees . Moreover , she accomplished the whole business in less than six months ; with lawyers , it generally takes about 14 months . " I have only a high-school education . If I can do it , anyone can , " she told me . Wisconsin became the first state to allow do-it-yourself probate , in 1973 . When Gov . Patrick J. Lucey signed the historic law , he said , " Wisconsin 's probate-reform act represents a great victory for the individual citizen . No longer does the law assume that the average man or woman can not handle his or her own personal affairs . No longer is the citizen required , in effect , to pay a legal tax amounting to hundreds or thousands of dollars for a service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform was n't easy . There was intense opposition from probate judges and lawyers . " Probate has always been one of the lawyer 's easiest dollars , " explained one non-lawyer legislator . " No business wants to lose a high-profit item . " A statewide petition , carrying 350,000 signatures , helped persuade many legislators . In the legislature , 28-year-old State Rep. ( now a State Senator ) David Berger of Milwaukee spearheaded the probate-reform movement . " At first , my lawyer-legislator colleagues tried to talk me out of it , " Berger , a non-lawyer , recalls . " They told me how technical probate was ;  | how ordinary people would n't be able to handle it ; how they 'd end up in expensive litigation with estates tied up for years . They tried to defend the minimum-fee percentages they were getting on probate work by stressing the great responsibility they had to assume . When I 'd point out that nearly all the probate paper work was actually done by their secretaries and friendly court clerks , they 'd say I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Bar Association had to be dragged , kicking and screaming , into the loth century by the average citizen fed up with the fees and the filings and the folderol . " The heart of the Wisconsin law is " informal administration " of the estate . Any size estate can be probated without constant court supervision as long as all the heirs agree . It helps if the will names someone in the family to be personal representative . If the will does n't , the heirs can agree on who should take on the job ? which consists of distributing the estate , paying the debts of the deceased , filing tax returns and giving each heir an inventory of the estate . Occasionally there may be a family dispute , and the law provides for taking the issue into court . " In effect , " says Berger , " we established that the court 's role should be strictly limited to settling disputes ? not interfering in the basic , ordinary administration of estates . " Wisconsin has also stopped several forms of probate patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking accounts jointly . Under the old system , lawyers used to get five percent of the total value of the dead person 's share of the property just for ending these joint tenancies . Now the transfer is made by merely filling out a simple affidavit and paying a $ro fee . Appraisers often got large fees for merely checking the prices of the stocks the deceased held . Not any more . In every case where a minor was mentioned in a will , a guardian ad litem had to be appointed in the past ? usually a lawyer who received handsome pay for minimal work . Now guardianship is not mandatory ; if needed , the guardian can be the child 's parent . Finally , the legislation did away with " public administrators , " usually lawyers appointed by the local probate judge to collect state inheritance taxes . So far , more than 400 Wisconsin residents have taken advantage of do-it-yourself probate . In Dane County ( Madison ) , Robert R. Pekowsky , probate registrar , has , under the guidance of the county probate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do-it-yourselfers . " I explain what 's involved , what papers are necessary , how it all works , " says Pekowsky , an attorney . " The do-it-yourselfer can purchase , for $I , a copy of our booklet , The Layman 's Guide to Probate . ' " ( A similar booklet , " Probating an Estate in Wisconsin ? Without an Attorney , " written by Senator Berger and a legislative as- sistant , has sold more than 30,000 copies , at cost ? 65 ? apiece . ) Here is a fairly typical Wisconsin case . Adele Conway* conferred with Pekowsky after her husband , Arthur , died of a heart attack . His will had appointed her as his personal representative to serve without bond . He had left his son and daughter $5000 each , and the rest of his estate to Adele . He and Adele had jointly owned their home , worth about $35,000 , a 1972 car , a savings account containing $2600 and a checking account containing $900 . He also had in his own name a mutual fund worth about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here 's what Adele Conway had to do after opting for do-it-yourself probate : 1 . She purchased the necessary legal forms for $1.5o at a local stationery store . 2 . She filled out the simple forms to transfer the jointly held home , bank accounts and car into her name . 3 . She sent a copy of her husband 's death certificate to his lifeinsurance company so that the $20,000 would be paid to her . 4 . She and her daughter made an inventory of the property held by Arthur Conway . They filled out a petition for informal administration ( including the signed approval of the three heirs to Adele 's appointment as personal representative ) and *This is a composite case ; the names are fictitious. a notice to possible " interested persons " to come forward . They Mu , prepared a simple form to be used in legal-notice ads for creditors to present their claims . 5 . After inspecting the will and the other signed forms , Pekowsky issued " domiciliary letters " formally giving Adele full permission to administer her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form accepting the role of administrator . 6 . She opened a special checking account for the Estate of Arthur Conway and paid all outstanding medical and funeral bills . She obtained her husband 's mutual-fund money by sending the company a copy of the domiciliary letters . She gave each of her children a $5000 check . 7 . She hired an accountant to fill out the income-tax , state inheritancetax and federal estate-tax forms . 8 . After waiting the required three months for creditors to come forward ( none did ) , she made a list of the estate 's expenses , subtracted the total from the final inventory value . She got a letter from the Wisconsin Department of Revenue that all taxes had been paid . She filled out , had notarized and signed the final form , " Personal Representative 's Statement to Close Estate . " Elapsed time : 41/2 months . Actual time spent : about 30 hours . Cost to Adele : about $45 . I talked to a dozen do-it-yourselfers all over the state . They had finished or were processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of them found the procedure a worthwhile investment of their time ; none found any major difficulties . In fact , none of the 400-odd estates probated without a lawyer has resulted in litigation . As simple as it is , not everyone who comes to Pekowsky opts for doit-yourself probate . For those who want a lawyer , Pekowsky advises on how to shop around and find one willing to work on an hourly basis . " I have rarely seen legal fees on an informally administered estate go over $400 , " he says . " And young lawyers ? who never used to get a crack at probate work ? are anxious to get these cases even on a nonpercentage basis . " There are also instances ? rarewhere do-it-yourself may not be advisable because litigation may follow . For example : when an illegitimate child is deliberately cut out of a will ; when an estate is left to a widow whose marriage was considered illegal by others in the family ; when there is a large estate ? in excess of , say , $250,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax savings that would earn his fee several times over . Several other state legislatures have been watching Wisconsin 's example with intense interest. * Next January , a do-it-yourself probate law will likely take effect in Minnesota , thanks to the six-year effort of Neil Haugerud , a farmer and former county sheriff who has been a state representative since 1968 . " We 've had the same problem Wisconsin had , " Haugerud said . " A lot of lawyers and most probate judges were against the reforms . " Recalling his battles on behalf of probate reform , he concluded , " It should n't take so long to get a basic reform that people want ? simple , inexpensive probate . " @#
