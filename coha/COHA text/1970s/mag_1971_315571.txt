South Viet Nam 's presidential campaign overshadowed another important election this week . Vietnamese voters went to the polls to select from among 1,297 candidates the 159 who will sit in the House of Representatives . Patterned after the U.S. House , Viet Nam 's lower chamber originates the nation 's legislation and , with a two-thirds majority , could override a presidential veto . <P> Until now , the House has always been pro-government by about a 2-1 margin . The makeup is likely to be much the same after this week 's ballots are counted . However , significant antigovernment blocs have begun to coalesce , thus the election promised to be a litmus test of how much support such antigovernment parties could get in the face of overwhelming obstacles . <P> Government Weapons . Opposition candidates in South Viet Nam must wage uphill battles that would dishearten the most determined American politician . The government not only controls television and radio , but its rigid press laws stifle antigovernment stories in newspapers and discourage favorable stories about opposition candidates . The army provides transportation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challengers . <P> The candidate who faced probably the worst obstacles in this election was Ngo Cong Duc , 34 , a Socialist , Catholic and nationalist , who is also the best-known and most outspoken antigovernment legislator in Viet Nam . To find out what was involved in campaigning against President Thieu , TIME Correspondent Stanley Cloud flew south last week to Duc 's home province to follow the candidate on the hustings . <P> Ngo Cong Duc is far and away the most popular candidate in Vinh Binh , a flat , fertile province in the Mekong Delta , 60 miles southeast of Saigon . Son of a wealthy canton chief who was assassinated by Communists in 1954 , Duc has gradually shifted from being a defender of the status quo to being a critic of the war and of the presence of foreign forces . He is now a national personality , and in any fair election would be an odds-on favorite to win . As the campaign came to an end last week , Duc expected to get no more than 20% of the vote . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has been a particularly outspoken opponent of President Thieu , whom he denounces as serving " the interests of war profiteers , the privileged classes and a foreign power the U.S.. " Soon after entering Congress in 1967 , he founded an antigovernment newspaper , Tin Sang ( Morning News ) , which soon became the most controversial journal in Saigon . He traveled to Paris and called for the withdrawal of foreign troops and the establishment of a neutral provisional government in Viet Nam . Since then , he has had nothing but trouble . Duc was labeled a Communist lackey and denied an exit visa for other overseas trips . Tin Sang has twice been bombed , has had its presses drenched with gasoline and acid and set afire , and its editions have been confiscated 150 times ; the latest two crackdowns came only last week . Beyond all that , Duc 's house in Vinh Binh was broken into and set afire , and his pie -- terre in Saigon bombed .                @ @ @ @ @
