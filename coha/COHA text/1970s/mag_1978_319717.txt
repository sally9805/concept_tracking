Begelman behind bars ? <P> When David Begelman , defrocked president of Columbia Pictures , returned to Hollywood from a skiing vacation in Colorado last week , he appeared to have ridden out a monstrous scandal . He had admitted padding expense accounts and forging names on checks that he cashed , but Columbia had treated him with more than compassion . He repaid the money with interest , and though he resigned in February , he was about to begin work under a contract as an independent producer of films that Columbia would distribute . That contract might pay him at least $1.5 million over the next three years , more than he would have earned if he had remained Columbia 's $400,000-a-year president . <P> But on Begelman 's return , Los Angeles District Attorney John Van de Kamp issued a four-count felony complaint , charging the executive with grand theft of $40,000 and with forging the names of Director Martin Ritt , Publicist Pierre Groleau and Actor Cliff Robertson on checks . So Begelman is set to surrender this week to Burbank police , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be sentenced to one to ten years in state prison on the grand-theft charge and one to 14 years on each of the three forgery counts . One serious problem for D.A . Van de Kamp : at a trial , he would have to persuade witnesses to testify against Begelman-no easy matter in the tightly knit film community which respects and fears powerful producers .
