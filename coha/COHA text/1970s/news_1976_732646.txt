txt The Kremlin seems to be having second thoughts about the place of the private car in the . Soviet Union . The rapid ? growth in number evidenced in the past five years is being slowed down . Questions are again being raised in Moscow as they were during the Khrushchev regime about the compatibility of private car ownership with the ' Soviet system . But even the Kremlin has to reckon with pressure from aspiring owners because they form the elite whose political loyalty is needed . The great spurt in Soviet automobile production began after the fall of Khrushchev who insisted that extensive taxi pools and car-hire facilities would be more in keeping with the Soviet way of life than capitalist-type car ownership by individuals . But Khrushchev 's successors tpok the contrary view . They wanted the managerial class to work harder and held car ownership as a reward . The same reward was available to the political elite ? officials who ruled the country in Moseow as well as those in the most remote localities . Was it right ? Prime Minister Alexei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of cars to industrial executives ? Some people had maintained , he recalled , that the Soviet Union needed no large-scale car production . Everyone was expected to ride buses , he said . Then he promptly proceeded to sign the // *Soviet autos again earn frown // contract with Fiat for the building of the Soviet Union 's largest automobile plant . Between 1970 and 1975 Soviet car output nearly quadrupled ? from 352,000 to 1,200,000 last year . But during the current five-year plan ending in 1980 , car production is to increase by no more than 3 percent a year . Reports from Moscow suggest that with car exports due to rise by 35 percent during the five-year period the number of cars available for the domestic market may be less in the future than it is now .

Those who want to see fewer cars maintained that private ownership leads to individualistic and anti-social phenomena and to the sharpening of inter-personal conflicts . But the underlying socio-political issue which has to do with the privileged status of those who are allowed to own cars was barely hinted at in the account . One participant spoke of Western warnings against the revival of class warfare between those who had cars and those who did not . Another spoke of the prestige factor of car ownership in the West and mentioned the possibility of the emergence of similar problems in the Soviet Union . However , in Russia the possession of a car already confers far more prestige on the owner than it does in the West .
