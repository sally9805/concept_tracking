New Olds saves fuel-but ... <P> To most Americans , the diesel engine calls to mind a smoke-belching locomotive or 20-ton truck . But in Europe , diesels also power some Mercedes sedans and Peugeots-and this week those cars will get a U.S. rival . General Motors will bring out the first U.S.-made diesel passenger car . It plans to offer the diesel as an optional engine on 50,000 Oldsmobile 88s and 98s in the 1978 model-year . <P> Detroit engineers long shunned diesels for cars because of their comparatively sluggish performance , noise and weight . But the energy crisis that started with the Arab oil embargo of 1973 caused GM designers to take another look . The diesel gets anywhere from 15% to 25% more miles per gal . than a gasoline-powered engine . Besides that , diesel fuel , which is essentially highly refined fuel oil , can cost as much as 10 per gal . less at the pump than regular gasoline depending on the area of the country . And the diesel engine , which has no spark plugs or distributor points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of development have enabled Olds engineers to solve some other problems . A passenger who did not happen to notice the word diesel on the hood ornament or the rear of the car probably could not tell , from quietness or smoothness of ride , that he was traveling in an unconventional auto . Yet some difficulties remain . The most serious is getting the engine to start on a cold morning . Since the whole principle of diesel ignition is to raise the temperature of the fuel mixture by compressing it into a superdense mass in the cylinder , a cold engine block can keep the motor from starting at all . The Olds diesel has a block heater and a " prechamber , " where the mixture is briefly heated by a glow plug . The driver turns on the ignition , then waits for an instrument-panel light to shine , telling him that he can step on the accelerator to start the engine . At 0 F. , that can take a full minute . <P> Another problem is where to find diesel fuel ; fewer than 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diesel still emits more and blacker smoke than a gasoline engine-although , quite surprisingly , the smoke contains fewer polluting hydrocarbons and less carbon monoxide than gasoline exhaust . Finally , there is the matter of price : though quotations have not been firmly fixed , GM expects its diesel cars to sell for $750 to $840 more than an Olds powered by a conventional engine . Is there , nonetheless , a market ? Probably . Mercedes-Benz introduced passenger diesels to the U.S. in 1952 , and in the past few years , demand has grown dramatically . Today nearly 50% of all Mercedes sold in the U.S. come equipped with diesel engines .
