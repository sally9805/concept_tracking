ROSEBUD <P> Directed by OTTO PREMINGER Screenplay by ERIK LEE PREMINGER <P> Just before young Margaret goes aboard to begin a Mediterranean cruise , her mother comments that Rosebud is an odd name for a yacht . Yes , the girl replies , it has something to do with some film . It has something to do with Citizen Kane , of course . After Margaret 's annunciation of such cultural obliviousness , it is difficult to work up too much alarm when she and her four equally dim-witted friends are kidnaped by Arab terrorists who start trading their lives , one by one , for compliance with ever-increasing demands . <P> The captive chicks are no more spiritually attractive than they are mentally alert . Nor are their hardships exactly heartrending . It is true that their cellar prison lacks fresh air , sunlight , comfy mattresses and a flush toilet and that the food is just not up to international cruise standards . Still , one can not help thinking that a little down-and-out living may be good for them . <P> Be that as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could bore an audience , and he expends most of his footage on the multinational attempt to rescue the girls . This effort consists largely of showing their parents worrying , actors entering and leaving buildings , and vehicles moving in various colorful locales . Such activities are neither menacing nor novel and never develop into sustained or amusing action . <P> Every once in a while . Peter O'Toole acts flaky as the CIA man in charge of the case , but more often he merely looks undernourished and hung-over . <P> <P> Cliff Gorman , as an Israeli intelligence officer , is what he is : a good comic actor in desperate need of a gag . Richard Attenborough , as the cracked mastermind of the plot , gamely gives more of himself than his small role calls for or can sustain . John V. Lindsay plays a U.S. Senator , the father of one of the kidnaped girls , pretty much as he played being mayor of New York City - like a B-picture leading man . At that , he is not the worst thing about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose from , it is hard to say who or what deserves the nod .
