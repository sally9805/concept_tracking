Rookies at the Helm No one is more likely to change from Saturday 's hero into Sunday 's nobody than a rookie pro-football quarterback . Experts generally agree that it takes five to six years for a fledgling passer to gain the poise , knowledge and confidence-in himself as well as that of his teammates-to become a winner . Even the best young signal callers usually find themselves enduring a lengthy novitiate behind a seasoned pro . <P> This year the situation is somewhat different . Just as 1970 was hailed as the year of the quarterback on college gridirons , so 1971 is rapidly shaping up as the year of the rookie quarterback in the National Football League . In the opening games of the season , a number of confident young post-grads have gotten off the bench and gone into the lineup to show how well they can do . One reason for their precocious success is that more and more colleges are turning to pro-type offense with an emphasis on drop-back passing . Another is , simply , that the new boys have an abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future-and perhaps the present : <P> &gt; Jim Plunkett of New England , 6 ft. 3 in. , 210 Ibs. , came to the lowly Patriots from Stanford as the N.F.L. 's No. 1 draft choice . In the season 's opener against Oakland , one of the strongest teams in the American Football Conference , Plunkett completed only six of 15 passes ; but two were touchdown tosses of 33 yds. and 22 yds. , and he led the Patriots to a stunning 20-6 upset victory . " I do n't think we can transform the Patriots into a winning team in one year , " he says realistically , " but I 've been pleasantly surprised to find that some of this business is not as difficult as I thought . " Plunkett saw a bit more of the difficulty last week against the tough Detroit Lions , who pulled the Patriots off their cloud by a 34-7 margin . Still , New England 's lone touchdown came on a 61 - yd. bomb from Plunkett to his favorite collegiate target , Randy Vataha . <P> &gt; Archie Manning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ibs. , was equally dangerous at Mississippi as a passer and runner . While it is almost axiomatic in the pros that a team can not win a championship with a scrambling passer , Manning may yet prove the exception . Directing a green team ( eight rookies in the starting lineup ) against the experienced Los Angeles Rams , Manning kept the rugged Ram defense off guard with his fancy footwork and completed 16 passes , one for a touchdown . Then he closed the game in a style reminiscent of his Merriwellian history at Ole Miss : with one second left on the clock he dived over the Ram goal line to give the Saints a 24-20 victory . The following Sunday , San Francisco blitzed both of their outside linebackers in an effort to contain Manning , dumping him six times and bouncing him out of the first half of the game with an eye injury . But Manning did complete eight passes , two for touchdowns , in a 38-20 losing effort . Archie has been so spectacular that he already has defenses gunning for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile : " I hope to end Manning 's career the next time we meet . "
