Paul Newman is a very hard man to approach . Until you speak to him the first time . Perhaps it 's the firm handshake , perhaps those famous blue eyes , or only the casual informality of his smile that lets you sigh nervously , reassured . Newman 's attraction as an actor has by now taken on some of the characteristics of a mythologically immortalized shrine where everyone wants to stand for a moment just to feel the magic . And the magic is there . Partly it exists because the aura that surrounds Newman is not the tinsel and glitter of the neon lights vibrating in the hot California night . The atmosphere around Newman is cooler , more comfortable . The confidence that he suggests by his easy manner in crowds brings out the courage in those people around him . A man sitting in a chair across from Newman suddenly speaks as if to test his own voice . " You know , " he says with a half-repressed laugh , " your eyes really are blue . " Newman smiles broadly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be something . " For some reason , I thought that Newman would be a bigger man than he is . His five feet ten inches and his short hands seem a little out of place as instruments of direction for those eyes and the steady controlled voice that you hear when you are close to the man . You have to he close to him to hear him . He seldom speaks loud enough for anyone three feet away from him to overhear what he is saying . This is a defense against the countless fans who are n't shy of flocking to Newman as they catch sight of him or hear his name being mentioned . Newman readily admits that these herds of squealing females who descend upon him make him feel " faintly embarrassed because what is created on celluloid has about half to do with me and half to do with what the playwright gives me to do . " Walking across the campus of Kenyon College in Ohio , Newman 's alma mater , where he had come back to visit and help with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows began to open and girls began screaming to one another throughout the quadrangle . Everyone who was with him that day proclaims the man 's wit and compassion toward the often overly inquisitive students . Young people are only one group among all ages and sexes who admire and follow his career . And Newman is known for his affection for youth although he has said that he would n't be 20 again for the world . Yet he says that " it 's a fantastic time for the young . In some ways they have less imposed upon them than my generation did  --  at least in terms of the American dream of two cars in the garage and keeping up with the Joneses . They are less acquisitive  --  property no longer has such importance  --  and they 're less inhibited . " As he ends his short soliloquy Newman shrivels slightly , hunching his shoulders , but his only show of tension is biting his already ragged cuticles and rubbing his hyperactive hands  --  thick , hard , boxer 's hands with short , stubby fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who shakes his head and mumbles something to her . Turning to those closer to him , he says , " People are really offended when I say ' I 'm sorry , but I do n't sign autographs. ' l simply do n't know why anybody should be required toput his name on a piece of paper or be interrupted while he 's eating dinner . It 's part of that Hollywood bull and whole sense of royalty . I do n't want to nurture that philosophy . People think you are public property . " The admiration of the public for the " star " is only one of many fantasies that Newman likes to believe he is helping to destroy . During the filming of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof the gossip about what might happen between Newman and Elizabeth Taylor flew around Sunset Boulevard . The hopes of these media soap opera reporters were lost on Newman , however . After working long hours beside the beautiful Taylor , Newman would shamble off home each night and watch boxing on television . Perhaps part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box office where Newman 's pictures are playing is locked up in his attitude toward Hollywood and the Hollywood scene . Newman says that he wants to remain unpretentious about his iconoclastic role in the acting world , but without pausing for a breath he rejects the idea of living in California and says that Hollywood studio executives are " used car salesmen at best . " So when Newman is n't working on location somewhere ( acting or directing ) he is at his home in Connecticut . " I can be much more private in Connecticut . People ca n't catch up with you there as easily and I 've never liked the California scene . No , I ca n't say that . What I really like is mobility . I love California for about a year . I like Connecticut for about two and a half years . The fact that I can move hack and forth is a great luxury . " Newman makes the conversation find its logical path , guiding you in a friendly way which lets you know the courtesy extended and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of the questions evident , Newman takes command , the mark of an experienced conversationalist . " I got into acting because I was thrown into jail . I was on the football team at Kenyon College . We always used to have brawls between the town 's guys and the college kids . We used to swipe their girl friends at the local gin mill . Those brawls , I thought , were great fun . You wind up with a black eye or a bloody nose , but no one had a chain and nobody had a knife and nobody had a gun and you knew it was on a one-to-one basis and there was a great sense of humor because you 'd see these guys on Monday and you 'd try to knock out a couple of teeth the next Saturday night . It was part of the culture in those days . " There was a big brawl out there and the quarterback and the first-line guard and tackle were thrown in the clink , and as they were taken out by the local gestapo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Drive my car in , ' and so I drove his car in about a half hour later and went into the sergeant 's office , and I said , ' Burt asked me to give you his keys . ' He said , Let me take a look at your knuckles . ' So the door closed in back of me . Four were thrown out of school and two of us were placed on probation . And it was simply because I could n't play football anymore and I did n't want to study that I went back to the theater . About ten days later I got my first part in a play there  --  this was my junior year  --  and I was in ten subsequent plays as a result of that . " During his years at Kenyon , Newman was coached by William Walton and Bob Fryer , now a stage and film producer . " Paul 's outstanding quality was the seriousness with which he worked , " recalls Walton . " He was extremely intelligent and unusual for a high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved his fun . During rehearsal breaks he used to head for the piano and pound out a boogie-woogie tune . A group would gather around . " Kenyon and football were only a midway point for Newman on his way to the top of his acting career . His academic life was suddenly shortened by World War II . He tried to become a pilot but " They discovered that I was color blind and threw me out of the program . " Newman eventually graduated from college , having already made a name for himself as a beer drinker and a hard-working actor . But at the time of graduation Newman still had no clear idea of where he was heading . " I did n't know what to do . So I drifted into a season of summer stock in a small theater in Wisconsin . Then instead of going into the family business , I joined the company of another theater in Woodstock , Illinois , where I appeared in 16 plays . " Yale and the Yale Drama School were finally to draw the young Midwesterner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lead them soon afterward to New York . When the first year of school ended for Newman at Yale he was off again in characteristic fashion , confident and excited . This time the move was to New York City and the Actors Studio . Even now , long after Newman listened to the teachers who also helped people such as Brando , Jimmy Dean and Rod Steiger , Newman recalls the Studio with warmth and appreciation . " The Actors Studio , whether they like it or not , has either credit or blame for what I 've become as an actor . I certainly came out of a very academic background , which was not every helpful , and I learned everything I 've learned about acting at The Actors Studio . But in those days it was known what was required of you . So the people who taught could teach you that . It was naturalism  --  it was the school of Inge , Miller and Tennessee Williams . There were very realistic and emotional things on television such as on ' Robert Montgomery Presents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaces the empty glass on the table top and leans back into his chair , a smile touching the corners of his face . The road from Inge to The Towering Inferno was long  --  which pleases Newman , he confesses , because the long road has kept his head from swelling , he believes . He is an unpretentious , serious man ; his work has always been acting a fictional role for the camera 's eyes , not for the eyes of the public . Rachel , Rachel was Newman 's first taste of real directing , and the man enjoyed the flavor of the occupation . This new field keeps Newman active , pursuing the career without having time to worry about when he will stop working on films . He is too involved in the creative process as well as the technical and business aspects of film making ever to think of retiring . With his wife , Joanne Woodward , he 's genuinely interested in writing , acting , and the artistic presentation of a dramatic concept in terms of the film . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you understand an actor 's problems , and you understand that certain transitions are difficult . Actors want to direct because they get fed up with the restriction of acting inside their own selves . " Though very often unhappy with his own performances and easily annoyed by the piecemeal formulas of production , Newman is too involved to abandon show business and give himself up to string beans and tomatoes in his garden . On top of his professional interest , Newman admits that he stills enjoys playing the part of a cowboy or a gambler in front of the camera . By piling up a cool million of " up front " money , plus a percentage on the profits , simply by taking a short walk through the newest Hollywood disaster area in The Towering Inferno , Newman has given himself the freedom for the production and direction of motion pictures that really engage his interest , be it a film on ecology or directing Joanne in a script they jointly admire . Then should he ever feel the need for the extra buck , he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anarchical hinterland of buddy-buddy mayhem . Their joint names on a contract for such a venture would automatically give them enough cash to buy themselves a battleship apiece or a corps of jumbo jets , should they feel the urge for such extravagances . That kind of loot would almost reconcile Newman to an occasional stopover in Hollywood . Now that he is completely aware of his ability and his desire to stay away from California and the life there , Newman has cooled a little in his condemnation of Hollywood , although he says , " I do n't like the way Beverly Hills looks . I loathe manicured lawns and I hate palm trees . " But he does go out there for visits quite often . Newman 's eyes sparkle briefly , his nervous hands catch at his fingers . He taps on the wooden table for luck . " I 'm a little more mellow now , " Newman says . " And I 'm not quite as feisty as I used to be . I do n't think I 've ever felt better . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river out in back . " Somebody once said of Newman that he lives a hilarious cockeyed variation on the theme of sound mind in sound body , eating health food and going through concentric circles of Hades with saunas and gymnasium torture machines so that he can smoke too many cigarettes and swill too much beer . It is a process of robbing Paul to pay Paul , and it is very trying . But the weariness of an actor striving to find the right material for himself and struggling to bring out the best in the material that he has is part of the theory of working and acting for Newman . Now that he is older and has more time and money he can relax a little and find the parts for himself  --  the parts which do n't panegyrize on modern problems but parts where the message is emotional . " I think there 's so little genuine emotion . It 's manufactured . My fantasy of making the perfect movie is very simple . You have an idea for a film , you work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a film or a play . You get a marvelously inventive director and you cast it the way it ought to be cast , not because you have to cast it a certain way . You get together and you have four incredible weeks of rehearsal and then you shut it down . And no one ever sees it . That would be a marvelous movie . You never crank a foot of film and you never have an audience to come in and see it . " As Newman talks , his lips part in a sign of comedy and seriousness . " I have a recurring nightmare , " he says , " in which I always dream that the whole bottom is going to fall out of my career ; that I will have paid several million dollars in taxes and will have no annuity to live on in my later years . " This nightmare , he explains , was built upon a feeling of guilt . " Because acting comes easily to me and because I 've been fortunate enough to have made pictures that turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend why the reward should be so extraordinary . That 's why I feel it might all come to an abrupt end . And if it did I would have to adjust to the circumstances . It is n't just the money , but the fact that I 've become accustomed to a certain kind of living and recognition that may be totally destroyed . I worry so much that I 'm lucky if I get five hours sleep at night , even between films . " And what if the bottom does fall out  --  or the sun does n't come up , or the world starts spinning in the other direction ? The question brings another , broader smile to the Shaker Heights thespian who sips his beer . " I do n't know . Motion pictures being what they are today , I might very easily go into marine biology . There are two things working against the actor . One : If you 've been in the business as long as I have , the audience will simply not accept you in certain parts . People will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . That 's not what they want to see . Two : There 's an escapist kind of film which is very fashionable now . I do n't know what 's happened in the theater in television , in motion pictures . Writers exTHE SRTURDAT EVENING POST hausted themselves in the social upheaval films of the thirties and the forties and in the kitchen drama , which was Bill Inge , which ' in a way was Tennessee Williams . " But the question was hypothetical and unlikely , and Newman confesses that he probably wo n't have the energy to begin the work that is necessary for becoming a marine biologist . Newman pauses for one last word . " If I think back to my aspirations as a young man , they certainly did n't include all of this that I have . There is a lot of luck connected with what 's happened to me . It 's been so good that I look ahead to what I have left of my life as gravy . Still , it 's hard to give up something that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not even sure about your own talent . One of the great qualities a person can have is to give up his hopes gracefully . " Newman walks away , the figure of a young , healthy , happy man , his stride confident and athletic .
