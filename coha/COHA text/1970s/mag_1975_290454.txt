The following Bicentennial Essay is the third in a series that will appear periodically into early 1976 and will discuss how we have changed in our 200 years . <P> <P> " Remember that time is money , " Benjamin Franklin wrote in his Advice to a Young Tradesman in 1748 . " Money can beget money , and its offspring can beget more , and so on ... He that kills a breeding sow destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation . " <P> For Max Weber , in his famous essay , these sentiments were the essence of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism . They sum up an ethos that is against the profligacy of a court life or the indifference to time of a Mediterranean culture . Franklin defends as just an attitude that in medieval life would have been condemned as avaricious . <P> The maxim time is money had a double meaning : first , it was an injunction against idleness ; second , it was a view of time as something methodical , a set of divisions into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of utility and the allocation of energies . It was a view that , in its own way , was radically new . As Lewis Mumford observed , " The clock , not the steam engine , is the key machine of the modern industrial age . " After consulting Gulliver on the function of his watch , the Lilliputians came to the conclusion that it was his god . <P> Though the clock now rules the industrial universe , it is a mechanical chronos that has been foreign to most human experience . All organisms have " circadian " rhythms ( from circa , about , and diem , day ) , whose periodicity is a response to biological needs . The psychological sense of time is one of dure , of bleak moments and moments of bliss , of the agony of time prolonged and time eclipsed ; memory is not the function of a " length " of time , but of its intensity . Most important , in the area of work-the experience that shapes character-time was long considered a function not of the clock , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century ago , most people in the Western world worked on the soil or on the sea . Time was measured not by the abstract division of matter and motion but by the exigencies of wresting one 's livelihood from nature . In 1790 ( the year Franklin died ) more than 90% of the population of the then United States ( a total of almost 4 million people ) worked on the land . The rhythm of life was shaped by the feeding of the animals , the sowing of the soil , the lambing of the ewes , the harvesting of the crops in a daily cycle that went from the crowing of the cock at dawn to the sleep of the chickens at night , and in a yearly cycle of the changing seasons . Today , less than 5% of the population live on farms , and the rule of the clock has become almost absolute . <P> The transformation of time did not begin , however , with the factory , but with a more surprising , yet obvious source-the railroad , and the exact coordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
