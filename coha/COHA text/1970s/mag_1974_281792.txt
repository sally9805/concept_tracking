AMARCORD . A great movie . Federico Fellini 's autobiographical fantasy about growing up in the seaside town of Rimini is lavish , pungent , full to bursting with the kind of encompassing , consuming affection for people that is the property of the true poet . <P> ANTONIA : A PORTRAIT OF THE WOMAN . A loving record of the life of Antonia Brico , a symphony conductor scarred but not humbled by the problem of being a woman and an artist in America . This beautifully fashioned documentary by Jill Godmilow and Judy Collins never bows to rhetoric or pity . <P> BADLANDS . The affectless , antiseptic world of two young killers delineated with hard skill by Director-Writer Terrence Malick . A chilly , forbidding work that catches currents of casual violence which seem typically American . <P> CHINATOWN . The year 's most skilled and elegant Hollywood entertainment . A Los Angeles private eye ( sardonically played by Jack Nicholson ) stumbles into a slough of personal and political corruption . The movie is a lambent caution about the dread but immutable uses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's remarkable and moving study of an electronic surveillance expert ( wonderfully acted by Gene Hackman ) and his inadvertent , frightening implication in a crime . The movie also concerns rituals of ruptured privacy , and has a prevailing urgency which moves it past mere topicality . <P> THE GODFATHER , PART II . Final proof that sequels can be better than originals . The questionable glories and bitter defeats of the Corleone family , brilliantly acted and told with a breadth of ambition and intensity characteristic of the work of Francis Coppola , for whom this has been a prodigious year . <P> THE LITTLE THEATER OF JEAN RENOIR . A wise and mellow coda in three parts by one of the old masters of world cinema . Each episode is rendered in a style that evokes a period in Renoir 's past work and comments on it with grace and wit . <P> THE SEDUCTION OF MiMi . Lina Wertmuller demonstrates that it is possible to make a movie about political ideas without being didactic . Wertmuller is fleet , funny and shrewd about the vagaries of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF LIBERTE . A Series of surreal blackout sketches by Luis Buuel , loosely grouped around the theme of man 's perverse pleasure in paradox . Buuel creates in this film a paradox of his own : a work that is carbolic and tonic all at once . <P> THE THREE MUSKETEERS . Richard Lester sends up Dumas without putting him down . Crafted with cheer and opulence , played for good humor and an occasional romantic thrill .
