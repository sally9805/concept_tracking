Well , one chief executive said to me that the chief executive does not like to lose his manhood . When his company is taken over , he 's no longer the prominent man in his industry . He no longer calls the shots , and that 's a terrible blow to people who have called the shots . <P> - James J. Ling <P> In a retrospective moment last fall , Dallas Entrepreneur James Ling was recalling a trying period in 1961 when he had temporarily been shunted aside as chief executive of his Ling-Temco-Vought , Inc . Conservative bankers had mistrusted the fast-moving Ling and chosen an older man . But Ling wasted little time in winning the bankers over and taking back his job . Last week one of the biggest and certainly the most daring of the conglomerate builders took the terrible blow again-from much the same source . At a four-hour emergency board meeting , called at the insistence of LTV 's nervous bankers , Ling stepped down as chairman and chief executive in favor of Robert Stewart III , a corporate rescue expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ling replaced Clyde Skeen as president of cash-strapped LTV , which had sales last year of $3.75 billion , and the company announced that Ling and Stewart will " share policymaking responsibilities . " They are going to need all the policymaking skill they can muster , for rarely has so large a corporation been so close to financial disaster . <P> The Squeeze Worsens . Jim Ling , to be sure , has been gambling on vast success-or flamboyant failure-ever since 1946 , when he began building a tiny electrical-contracting business into a huge conglomerate . He took his greatest risk in 1968 with the purchase of Jones &; Laughlin Steel Corp. , the sixth largest steel producer in the U.S. Using borrowed money , he paid too much for the company . He bought control for $85 a share , and since then J &; L stock has plummeted to $12.75 . There was little that Ling could do to stop the slide . A federal antitrust suit barred him from exercising his command . <P> To meet LTV 's heavy interest charges on its $862 million debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Staco , Inc. , Wilson Sporting Goods , Allied Radio and Whitehall Electronics , as well as most of the conglomerate 's holdings in Computer Technology and some of its stock in Braniff Airways . Last week the cash squeeze got worse when Jones &; Laughlin directors voted to omit the quarterly dividend-cutting off $4.2 million in income that LTV could have applied to its debts .
