Soon there will be only two kinds of airlines , those with Concorde and those which take twice as long . <P> <P> In recent newspaper ads , that was the provocative sales pitch for the Concorde , the supersonic transport developed by Britain and France at a cost of nearly $3 billion . Indeed , the sleek , needle-nosed aircraft can fly 1,400 m.p.h. , twice the speed of sound . It cuts trans-atlantic air travel from seven hours to 3% , and can lower the time for a San Francisco-Tokyo run from 11% hours to seven . But the Concorde ads may be prematurely optimistic . The plane has not yet received permission to serve U.S. airports , and unless it does , Franco-British dreams of a new era in air travel may never get very far off the ground . <P> Final Arguments . The U.S. has long been considering whether or not to allow the Concorde to fly into its airports . Now at last , it is about to decide . At a special hearing held in Washington last week , Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French and British government officials , environmentalists and U.S. Senators , Representatives , Governors and mayors presented their final arguments for and against admitting the Concorde . At that hearing , Coleman promised to make a decision by early February . His choice will not be easy . A ruling in favor of the Concorde would bring down the wrath of environmentalists , who charge that the craft is too noisy , burns too much fuel and is a threat to the ozone layer . A decision to bar the plane would be considered an unfriendly act by the British and French and could sour U.S. relations with both countries . <P> The roots of the Concorde conflict run deep . The U.S. launched a program in 1963 aimed at developing its own SST , but then dropped out of the race in 1971 when Congress cut off funds . The lawmakers decided-over the objections of the Nixon Administration-that money for the expensive project could be better used for more important federal programs ; they also feared that the SST would endanger the environment . <P> Those arguments did not deter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TU-144 , or the French and British , who had already ridden out an SST crisis . <P> When a British Labor government came to power in 1964 shortly after the Concorde program got under way , it decided that Britain could not afford the project and tried to bow out . It changed its mind only after it became clear that the French might sue Britain in the International Court of Justice for failing to live up to the terms of the Franco-British agreement .
