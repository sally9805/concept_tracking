JAPAN <P> In the big cities the lines start forming shortly after 3 a.m . Even the most polite are inclined to forget themselves as they fight for one of Japan 's scarcest commodities : space on the golf course . So popular has the game become that it is regularly played by an estimated one-tenth of Japan 's 108 million people , ranging from the Prime Minister to Zen monks . So many gorufu courses are being built that some environmentalists are complaining about a new kind of pollution : golf pollution . <P> Already the land-poor country 's 700 golf courses take up as much space as 1 Tokyos . Seven hundred more courses are on the planning boards , and nature lovers have nightmares of the whole country eventually being converted into one vast patchwork of putting greens and sand traps . In Chiba prefecture , southeast of Tokyo , there are so many courses that the area is becoming known as " the golfers ' Ginza . " <P> Chiba officials worry that wells may run dry just keeping grass green on the 22,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics is that there is almost no way to construct a golf course in Japan without violating nature . Most of the flat land in the mountainous nation has long since been given over to cities and needed farms ; by necessity , many greens have been put on hillsides , where they result in the destruction of forests , blocked streams and erosion . " There 's something definitely abnormal about this , a bit of sheer outlandishness , " says Chiba prefecture 's governor , Taketo Tomono , an occasional golfer . To discourage the building of more courses , Tomono 's government has stipulated that they must meet severe-perhaps impossible - ecological standards . " It will be tough indeed , " he boasts , " for a new course to open up in our prefecture . " Following Tomono 's lead , at least 35 of Japan 's 46 other prefectures have come up with anti-golf land laws . <P> Many think that the environmentalists are overstating the case , and that golf is hardly in the same league as the other pollutions strangling Japan . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined or emotional , " says Norio Nomura , an official at the Ministry of Construction in Tokyo . " When the most precious commodity in Japan-land-gets grabbed up fast , the people react sharply and emotionally . " Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka , a devoted golfer , adds : " Golf courses retain greenery . Japan needs more greenery and more golf courses . "
