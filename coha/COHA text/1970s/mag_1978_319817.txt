When CBS began flirting with the idea of acquiring Fawcett Publications Inc. two years ago , the network 's lawyers checked with the Justice Department and came away with the impression that there were no objections . Believing that the way was clear , CBS went ahead and paid $50 million for Fawcett ( 1976 sales : $135 million ) and merged its magazines ( Woman 's Day and Mechanix Illustrated ) and paperback-book operation into CBS 's publishing division . <P> Either the CBS lawyers heard wrong or the trustbusters changed their minds . Last week the network found itself the target of a Justice Department complaint aimed at forcing CBS to divest itself of Fawcett 's large paperback business and to refrain in the future from acquiring any paperback publisher . <P> The complaint , which was filed in Federal Court in Manhattan , focuses on the combination of CBS 's Popular Library Books , which in 1976 controlled 2.6% of the nation 's $740 million paperback business , and Fawcett , which had a 9.4% share . In its brief , the Justice Department charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends " to create a monopoly . " According to antitrust doctrine , any arrangement that lessens competition can be interpreted as creating a monopoly , even though the resulting company happens to control only a fraction of the market . Said the complaint : " The mass-market paperback-publishing business is concentrated and is experiencing a trend toward further concentration . " <P> CBS denied that its acquisition of Fawcett gave it a dominant role in the highly competitive paperback business and vowed that it would " defend itself vigorously " against the charges . " You never can tell what Justice will do , " said one CBS executive . Referring to CBS 's belief that it had the trustbusters ' approval in 1976 , he added : " Anyway , that was the Ford Justice Department , and this is the Carter Justice Department . " <P> At first glance , the Justice Department 's case seemed weak . Even with the acquisition , CBS has gained only a 12% share of the paperback market , and the network 's purchase of Fawcett did not drive any major competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller firms have left the market during the past decade . And entry into the field is very difficult , if not impossible , for newcomers . In the past three years , Doubleday took over Dell , a paperback publisher ; Britain 's Penguin acquired Viking and its softback operation ; Gulf &; Western bought Pocket Books ; and West Germany 's Bertelsmann Publishing Group gained control of Bantam.
