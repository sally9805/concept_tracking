Shortly after noon last Wednesday , the radio in the Miami office of the Bahamas Line shipping company crackled with an emergency message . It came from the captain of the Johnny Express , a slow ( 12-knot ) , 1.500-ton freighter returning to Miami after delivering general cargo to Port-au-Prince , Haiti . Captain Jos Villa , a Cuban exile who is now a U.S. citizen , reported that as his ship was passing between the West Caicos Islands and the Inaguas in the Bahamas , a Cuban patrol boat demanded that he submit to a search . When he refused to stop , the Cubans opened fire . Villa was badly hurt and so were some members of the 13-man crew , many of whom were Dominicans . <P> As the attack continued . Villa talked for nearly an hour with the Miami office . Excerpts : <P> Villa : Notify the Coast Guard . We have wounded . <P> Miami : Affirmative , affirmative . <P> Villa : These people are finishing us . <P> Miami : Tell us if they are still firing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have the helicopter come quickly . I 'm badly wounded . <P> Moments later , the radio of the Johnny Express fell silent . In a flagrant breach of freedom of the seas , the Cubans rammed and boarded the freighter , then towed it to a port on Cuba 's north coast . The Coast Guard helicopter never arrived . Partly because the ship was sailing under the Panamanian flag and partly because the incident took place outside U.S. territorial waters , the Coast Guard delayed its response to the call for more than an hour . <P> Washington 's official response was even slower . At first the State Department said only that the U.S. could make no protest since the ship was registered in Panama . Then , as the impact of Cuba 's piratical act sank in . President Nixon personally intervened . As a sign of his concern , the President received Villa 's wife at Key Biscayne and promised to do his best to secure the captain 's immediate release . Later , the U.S. warned Cuba that it would take " all measures under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further attacks , and U.S. war planes and naval units began to patrol the Caribbean . <P> Cuba was unrepentant . The owners of the freighter are the Babun brothers , members of a wealthy Cuban family that settled in Miami twelve years ago . Radio Havana claimed that the Babuns are front men for the CIA and that last October the ship took part in a machine-gunning raid on the Cuban seaside town of Boca de Sam , in which several people were killed and wounded . Earlier this month the Cubans seized another Babun freighter , the Lyla Express , near Great Inagua . That ship and its crew are still in Cuba . <P> So far , the Cuban naval offensive has been directed at solely Babun-owned ships . But Radio Havana warned that Cuban gunboats would have no compunction whatsoever about seizing any vessel " under any flag or camouflage " that they believed had been engaged in " counterrevolutionary activities .
