TO THE HARBOR LIGHT <P> by HENRY BEETLE HOUGH <P> 210 pages . Houghton Mifflin. $8.95 . <P> <P> New Englanders generally , not to mention hordes of fancy estivators from New York and Washington , know Henry Beetle Hough as the fabled and enduring editor of a much loved Martha 's Vineyard paper , the biweekly Vineyard Gazette . But the paper was sold soon after Hough 's wife of 45 years died , in 1965 . Hough himself is now edging toward 80 . He lives alone in a seven-room house in Edgartown , Mass. , with a philosophical three-year-old collie named Graham . Except for Graham , he regards the young as heading into a world far less attractive than the one he grew up in . He also finds many of them hard to talk to . " Every organism , animal as well as human , " he writes , citing Microbiologist Rene Dubos , one of his favorite authors , " lives in a private world of his own to which no one else has complete access . It is like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this account of his own autumnal days on Martha 's Vineyard , Hough , with great skill and charm , approaches the pangs and pleasures of aging in ways that very much recall Walden 's formula : keep track of housekeeping details and the transcendental homilies will take care of themselves . At home Hough 's day still begins as it has for years , with a predawn walk to Edgartown 's harbor light . Graham goes along but does not always agree to the route his master has chosen , and , like many Americans , has " a weakness for excavation . " If in his daily round of mail and meals , of musings and memories , Hough feels a pronouncement coming on , he shares it . " A house needs its identity of habitation , " he thinks on returning from the walk , " yet I put beside this fact another I have tested for truth-the joy at last of arriving home and finding no one there .

" <P> Hough moves with an essayist 's grace from lemonade to his dislike of meetings , from Virginia Woolf to George Borrow . He is never sentimental , but he does not give up on old affections either . He is master of the splendidly abrupt transition : " In December 1971 I threw out all my city shirts , hoarded since 1926 . " Or : " Today Graham ate a whole banana . " Or , with drastic irony : " Someone is sure to mention sex . " Perhaps predictably Hough has it in for Sigmund Freud because he feels that the good doctor unwittingly damaged the possibilities of romance and encouraged the adoption of " the obscene , as if by way of penitence , as the natural way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
