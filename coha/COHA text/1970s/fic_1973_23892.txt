a story by William Sarovan IS N'T TODAY THE DAY ? Or , Saroyan 1964 O NE OF THE IDEAS I carry around in my head all the time is , Today 's the day . And it never is , although now and then it almost is . Today 's the day I 'll really write , the day I wo n't have to think how to do it , the day be with it , unable to do anything wrong . the great day , my day , the day of the innocent in the world  --  me . A question I carry around all the time is . Who makes up the jokes ? Nobody seems to know . Jokes do n't happen by themselves , but nobody has ever tracked down a joke to the guy who made it up . Another thing , of another order , that I carry around all the time is a certain amount of remembering of other writers , old friends of mine . and old enemies . One of them is a writer I 've known thirty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better reader in fact than he is a writer , who quit writing thirty years ago , although to this day he does n't act as if he quit at all , he thinks he 's been in there all the time writing great books . This writer reads a book and jumps into his car and races ten miles to the house of another writer to say , " I ca n't read William Faulkner . the guy just does n't know how to write , he refuses to revise , the stuff goes on and on without punctuation , even , but I just forced myself to read this new book of his and the thing ca n't be read , it 's impossible to read . " " What 'd you read it for , then ? " " Sanctuary ! Like the Hunchback of Notre Dame hollered , but of course that 's the name of the book , too , but it was n't any sanctuary for rne . " And then long years later he 'll drive four hundred miles to ask about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How do they do that ? " " I do n't know . " " Why do they do it ? " " I do n't know . " And then the next day or the day after , I 'll remember another writer , only this one not only could n't write , be could n't read either , but what he could do , he did for eight straight years , and then zing went the strings of his heart , and his wife was a widow , and his two kids were half-orphans . What he did was write movie scenarios ? but seriously , which was probably the secret of his success , because people who make movies like to take the whole thing seriously . Damned if everybody does n't like to take everything he does seriously , except maybe me . Take plays , for instance , opening nights , actors performing , and then taking curtain calls while a whole buildingful of people clap their hands off , I ca n't take that seriously , I feel sorry for the playwright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel sorry for the actors enjoying the applause so humbly , they make tears roll out of my eyes , but the whole thing is a joke , only never knew anybody who could make a joke to tell out of it . Everybody takes everything seriously . Go to a barber for another haircut , and he thinks he 's got something going for himself personally , his own superior way of giving a haircut , of being a barber , not like those bums who drink hair tonic and ca n't keep a job for longer than ten years . He takes barbering seriously , he believes barbering has got to be taken seriously . If an ape is taught to give a haircut in half the time the barber takes , and it 's twice as good a haircut , the barber says , " They hypnotized him . Wait till that boy comes out of it , he wo n't be no world-beater . " W HEN I GOT tP THIS MORNING I hollered , " Today 's the day . " While I shaved I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's like an old hobo in the doorway of an empty store at daybreak , so what ? I did n't care , because I knew the truth : I was young , I was handsome . I was a writer , and this was my we want it , so do n't be unreasonable about how much you want for it . " For forty-four minutes this morning this was the day . Not only the day I had been waiting for all my life , it was the day everybody else has always been waiting for , and I felt chosen to he the one the day would come to , at last . I felt so chosen I could barely tolerate myself , my doubting self , my disbelieving self , my glum hangdog bored tired self mumbling , " Take it easy ? ' I wanted to feel courteous , even to himself , my own lazy fat self , magnanimous if possible , indifferent to his insults , unchosen as he is , as he has always been , and I wanted him to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : " You come along too , why do n't you ? " Generosity unbounded , goodwill galore , and Christian charity unfiltered . Morning , man , and the world is here again . There 's a sunflower somewhere with a shopworn bee buzzing around the golden fuzz out of which the yellow petals laugh about the light , the bee intoxicated by the offbeat smell and the dazzling color . It 's all now again , is n't it , old-timer ? The whole thing 's here again , is n't it , as if by schedule ? This has got to he the day . What jokes , what stories , what characters , what fun , what art , what laughter , what writing , what readable writing , what readers the writing would make , transforming a lot of half-dead dream-drenched fools into alert , raring readers . Just get me to my old table and my old typewriter , and watch me go , in spite of the fifty-five years , the bad gimp since 1939 but lately forgotten , the chronic catarrh but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooka Mama soda cracker , the dim right eye but useful in support of the left , just get me to the stack of good old blank paper and watch me fill six or seven sheets with great wonders . Plot ? Who needs plot ? Form , continuity , style ? Who needs them ? Man , when the world is the world again , the next day has got to be the day , and this was the next day , postponed a little , postponed fifty years , on account of rain , influenza , school , work , war , movies , and the news , the big news , the daily news , but now at last no longer postponed , here at last and exactly on schedule , as promised , totally unpostponed , instant , as instant as the coffee in the fourth black cup , instant and everlasting , all on account of me , the original innocent , the unlettered man of letters , the unschooled founder of the only school , the rejecter of the forms , the story , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brief , the last will , the free brochure about happy retirement on a hundred a month , the price list , the catalogue , the directory , the phone book . The coffee 's supposed to be wrong because the oil in it gives you ulcers , the cigarettes are wrong because they give you cancer , liking the world is wrong because the world is contemptible , beingkeen about being alive is wrong because being alive is stupid and in any case how long can it last ? Believing is wrong because it has all been disproved . Expecting something good to come out of a new day is wrong because there has never been a precedent for it . Forgetting gimp , catarrh , hissing ear , and dim eye is wrong because they are all there , smiling and waiting , willing and able to make a shambles of a man at any moment . Remembering the fun and the laughter and the girls and the children born of them is wrong , because where is it all now , where are they all now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to the writer , he will not learn , he refuses to learn , he 's even too stupid to be stupid , and he says again , " Today 's the day , " taking nothing and nobody seriously , excepting the day itself , as clean as a sheet of blank white paper . So he sat down , so I sat down , so whoever it was sat down twelve hours ago at six in the morning , San Francisco still dark , Hooka tooka Mama soda cracker , how about the kids who make up songs , how about the way they sing them ? Every day I hit the sack at one in the morning , wake up at three , switch on the transistor radio , and there they are again , held in contempt by Clifton Fadiman , ridiculed by Marya Mannes , there they are again , bugling at the little red fox , indifferent to the crisis at the Saturday Review about how total destruction is drawing nearer because nobody understands the inevitability of it : Elvis Presley , Ray Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wonderful little girls who sing he 's a walking miracle , or you do n't own me , or go now . Nobody who is anybody wants to take pride in the singing boys and girls , but the fact is they are telling the story and we are n't . We 're making art , we 're being superior , we have read Stendhal , have n't we ? We know , do n't we ? We have written stories , novels , plays , poems , and fiery editorials , have n't we , having gone to serious school and having taken every bit of it seriously ? I take pride in them , the singers . I even take pride in the little girls who gathered together in organized groups to scream at the Beatles , four funny-looking Liverpool boys who learned to avoid going to barbers , not to be embarrassed about it , and to wink about the fortune it was bringing them . I take pride in Johnny Cash , Ferlin Huskey , Marvin Rainwater , and Pete Seeger  --  ticky tacky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them is made out of ticky tacky , every one of the nice people who go to barbers , and in a pinch become barbers , and take it seriously . And I take pride in the great fat boy , my own friend ca n't even remember his name , phoned me one time when he thought he ought to and said , " Anything I can do , man ? " ? singing everything ever made into a song , " and a little bitty tear brought me down . " After I 'd
