It has been a year for gimmicks and theory-clogged trivia in many fashionable art galleries , so one can only rejoice at a show that demonstrates anew the richness and ethical seriousness of painting . Such an exhibition-modest in scale , exceptional in quality-is now on view at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis : a group of 16 new pictures by Robert Motherwell . <P> To speak of a " comeback " by an artist as conspicuous as Motherwell may seem odd , but it has a certain point . At 57 , he is one of the last charter members of the New York School of the 1940s to remain alive and painting . Pollock , Gorky , Rothko , Kline , David Smith , Hofmann , Newman and Reinhardt are all dead , and their work has been so long discussed , labeled , ticketed and run through the meat grinder of mass art education that it has already assumed the air of an august period style-the last " heroic " American art . The absurd consequence has been that the group 's surviving members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be mistakenly regarded as anachronisms whose work occupies a historical pigeonhole but has only a shadowy relationship to the present . <P> Being Social . What is more , Motherwell has the mixed fortune of intelligence . As writer , teacher and editor , he has for the past 25 years made essential contributions to the understanding of modern art in America . " It 's my way of being social , rather than going to cocktail parties , " he says . " It 's also an excellent relief from the anguish of painting-an attempt to regain my social equilibrium and to give back to society something of what it has so generously given me : education , respect , dignity , artistic freedom . " Thus he is the opposite of the clich that stuck to Abstract Expressionism-the artist as roaring boy , trapped and goaded by his own tragic energies , armed with much myth but no history , articulate only at brush point . <P> It has never been possible to make a romantic hero out of Motherwell , with his essentially aristocratic humanism , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he moved to Greenwich , Conn. , it was uncharitably rumored that he did so to be near one of his favorite restaurants , La Cremaillre ) and his white Mercedes . Motherwell 's lifestyle , his thought and his painting are much of a piece , and they have consistently served to remind American viewers that culture is a continuum , not a competitive race for the laurels of mere originality , that art builds on other art and that a " protectionist " attitude against European and specifically French art may be useful as a mask but involves a certain loss as well . <P> Consequently , Motherwell , despite his genial behavior and his look of a rumpled , adipose bear prodded from hibernation , remains the stone guest at the festivities of American art , reminding the partygoers that modernism did not begin and will not end in New York . " Every intelligent painter , " he wrote in 1951 , " carries the whole culture of modern painting in his head . It is his real subject , of which everything he paints is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says a gloss . " <P>
