txt The Vote In New York : Everybody Was for the Bond Issue Except the People Everybody was for the Transportation Bond issue : the Governor , the Mayor , good government groups , businessmen , labor unions , both major parties . Everybody but the voters . So it was that last Tuesday  --  ignoring a last-minute Madison Avenue advertising blitz  --  New Yorkers went to the polls and slapped down the pots . In the process , they plunged the state and the city into a fiscal crisis of historic proportions ; the likely results : a statewide cutback in essential services and an increase in New York City'a transit fare . In the wake of the bond issue 's demise , the political pallbearers sought answers to some tough and important questions . Why did it happen ? What will it mean to a state and city already etrapped by austerity budgets ? and , incidentally , to those unlikely partners in defeat , Governor Rockefeller and Mayor Lindsay ? What can be done to avoid total disaster ? There were signs that the bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Governor personally called a newspaper office to complain about a story , and the Mayor called his Air Resources Commissioner , Robert N. Rickles , a " damn fool " and " a nut " for opposing the bond issue . In politics , as in sports , that 's called " choking up . " But there was little advance indication of the extent of the bond issue rout . ( It lost by 900,000 in a total vote of 4 million . ) The proposition was supposed to do well in the city , particularly , after the Governor and the Mayor made their much-publicized deal to use some of the bond proceeds to hold the transit fare at 30 cents . Instead it was defeated in Brooklyn , Queens and Staten Island and just barely passed in Manhattan and the Bronx . Upstate , where some trouble had been expected , It was a disaster . The proposition was approved in only a handful of the 53 counties , most of them along the New York-Pennsylvania border where the Southern Tier Expressway is under construction with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the New York City suburbs , the bond proposal was trounced , even though there have been noticeable improvements on commuter railroads as a result of the last $2.5-billion transportation bond issue approved in 1967 . Returning to form and disagreeing , the Governor and the Mayor in their Wednesday morning quarterbacking had different explanations for the defeat . " This is a reflection of the national mood . . . the people do n't want to take on new taxes , " the Governor said . It was a vote for " belt-tightening , " The Mayor did n't see it that way . " The vote on the bond issue was a rebellion against concrete , " he said . Many city residents believed that almost all rather than about half of the bond issue proceeds should have been earmarked for mass transit rather than highways . They had their counterparts upstate who did n't take kindly to voting for a bond issue to save the subway fare at 30 cents when they often pay up to 50 cents for bus fare . Other politicians and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation stemming from many unfulfilled promises made in behalf of earlier bond issues in 1951 and 1967 . The Second Avenue subway , for example , was first pledged 20 years ago . It still is n't even a hole in the ground . The style of the " Vote Yes " campaign , some observers felt , had turned another kind of credibility gap into a mighty chasm . It had to do with the attitudes of New Yorkers toward their Governor and Mayor . One high Republican , who campaigned for the issue , said he encountered many voters who said : " If those two blankety-blanks are for it , something must be wrong . " Voters were treated to the sight of the Dynamic Duo riding up to subway stations in their chauffeured limousines for a little mixing with the masses on . behalf of the bond issue . One politician suggested that the election-eve photograph of the Duo plus William J. Ronan , chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , straphanging amidst the photographers , probably cost the bond issue thousands of votes . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anger than in sorrow . Whatever the reasons , the bond issue went down like the Titanic . And it left state and city officials with a terrible sinking feeling . The first installment of what another politician called " Son of Fiscal Crisis " began hours after the vote was counted and only a few months after the latest fiscal dilemmas in Albany and New York City had been at least temporarily " resolved , " A series of summit conferences involving the Governor , the Mayor , legislative leaders and various coat-holders and swordbearers had brought forth : a 1-cent rise in the sales tax , other tax increases , plus some mirrors and other fiscal flimfiammery . The results had been sharp cuts in the welfare and Medicaid allowances ; layoffs of nearly 10,000 state workers and a freeze on hiring that still stands ; a cut from 21 to 18 per cent in the localities ' share of the state revenuesharing program only a year after the program got under way ; reductions in the City University budget , and a virtual halt to any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most liberal and progressive in the nation . The Governor had looked to the bond issue to provide all the funds for the next few years for needed transit improvements and the state 's traditional highway building program , so that general tax revenues could be used exclusively for education , welfare and other nontransportation items . To compound the fiscal chaos , the current state budget is already out of balance . As part of his campaign to promote the bond issue , the Governor , far earlier than usual , confessed to his constituents that state tax revenues were lagging by a projected $470-rnillion because of the national economic slowdown . That prospective deficit nearly doubled with the bond issue defeat because the Governor , like a poker player betting next month 's rent , had included in his current budget $300-million from the big bond issue that is not there . It was a long way from the Rockefeller , circa 1955 , and " pay-as-you-go " state financing . State fiscal wizards were already talking last week about such sleight of hand tactics as deferring tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even borrowing on anticipated taxes to relieve the crunch . But they also emphasized that the real meat and potatoes savings will come from reductions in state aid to localities , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the entire state budget . That means that the Governor and the Mayor are partners in the fiscal crisis whether they like it or not . When the state gets a pain in the pocketbook , the city , which gets nearly onethird of the state 's funds , winces . The 30-cent transit fare was also jeopardized by the defeat of the bond issue , but most politicians believe that the Governor and the Mayor , after much fancy footwork and buck-passing , will come to some agreement to prevent the fare from jumping to 45 cents . Such an increase " would make a ghost town out of this city , " said one politician , envisioning an acceleration in the number of businesses leaving the city . City officials are also hopeful that the transit fare , which was frozen under President Nixon 's wage-price freeze , will continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be only a small increase , if any . The most likely solution to the transit fare is state permission for the city to borrow subsidy money and maybe ' even a state loan to the city in anticipation of Federal mass transit aid . These two plans were the essential features of the Rockefeller-Lindsay bond-issue agreement two weeks ago . Normally , the Republican-dominated Legislature would not be overly concerned with saving the transit fare or even keeping the increase to 5 cents . But Albert H. Blumenthal , deputy minority leader of the Assembly , pointed out that commuters were also threatened with fare increases by Dr. Ronan if the bond issue went down . " The only saving feature is that the Long Island Railroad fare is also threatened , " said Mr. Blumenthal . A suburban-city coalition can command a majority in the Legislature . To compound the city 's problems , it also had gambled on passage of a community development constitutional amendment that would have permitted the city to borrow $300-million outside its debt limit for capital construction . The amendment went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled or paid for with borrowed funds diverted from other areas . With few signs of any major improvements in the economy , more layoffs , cuts in government services and aid seem inevitable at both the state and local levels . As one cynic put it " The Mayor may even have to lay off some of his advance men . " Many of those who have been organizing the Mayor 's trips out of state to test a possible Presidential candidacy are on the city payroll . The remark pointed up the political implications of the bond issue defeat for both the Gvernor and the Mayor . For one thing , it demonstrated that their appeal in their home state is hardly irresistible . They said yes in unison  --  for a change . The voters said no . It also meant that they will be spending the next six months bickering over such less-than-cosmic matters as subway fares and budget cuts . Not very good imagery for a Mayor who obviously wants to be a President and a Governor who once did , but is said to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration . The irony of the situation was not lost on many politicians : the two bitter foes , the Governor and the Mayor , standing together , if not exactly handin-hand , aboard the sinking bond issue . There loomed the possibility that two once-promising political careers may end up being drowned in a sea of red ink . - FRANK LYNN
