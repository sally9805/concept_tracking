Whenever a joke fad becomes entrenched , the small Los Angeles publishing house of Price/Stern/Sloan issues a slender paperback containing a sampling of the humor . Thus , in 1953 , the firm published Droodles , a collection of simple line drawings with funny captions ; in 1963 it put together The Elephant Book , offering the then-popular elephant jokes . Now , at least by Price/ Stern/Sloan standards , another kind of joke has made the grade . The company has just published The Good News , Bad News Book . <P> Good News , Bad News jokes* run the entire gamut of human experience and are often topical . In one current gag , for example , President Richard Nixon suddenly appears on all the television networks : " I have some good news for you tonight-and some bad news , " he tells his audience . " The good news is that this week our planes have stopped bombing Hanoi . The bad news is that at this very moment they are on their way to Peking . " <P> A swimming coach telephones the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some good news for you . Your son George just broke the Intercollegiate triple somersault high-diving record . I also have to tell you that I have some bad news . There was no water in the pool . " <P> The jokes also occur in historical settings . Below decks in a Roman galley , for instance , the slave master addresses the slaves chained to their oars : " Slaves , the good news is that at the next port there will be food and grog for everyone . The bad news is that this afternoon the captain wants to go water skiing . " <P> <P> " * The gags probably originated a few years ago as spoofs of the in-flight announcements made by airline pilots . For example : " This is your captain speaking . I have some good news and some bad news . The good news is that we 're ahead of schedule . The bad news is that our navigational equipment has failed and we have no idea where we are . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
