One of the basic tenets of the feminist movement is that there are no important inherent differences between the sexes . That creed is being challenged on two fronts : <P> LEARNING : Why Do Boys Do Better ? Six years ago , the Denver-based Education Commission of the States began a Government-financed study known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress . After analyzing tests given to nearly 900,000 students and young adults across the U.S. , the commission 's researchers concluded that men have a clear edge over women in most areas of academic achievement . <P> The commission 's report shows that in science , mathematics , social studies and citizenship-four of the eight areas studied-the sexes are roughly equal at age 9 . But by age 13 , girls fall behind in these areas of study in a relative decline that continues through adolescence and into adulthood . In reading ability and knowledge of literature , girls are ahead of boys until age 17 , but the same pattern of relative decline shows up as they grow older . Only in writing ability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like some other studies , the National Assessment finds the male lead in mathematics " overwhelming . " Nine-year-old girls do as well as boys in basic arithmetic but lag later in geometry and exercises dealing with measurement . Strangely , though girls can match boys in arithmetic and are better than boys at reading , they do worse on " word problems " involving simple computations , such as determining the lowest per-ounce price for a box of rice . <P> Dr. Roy H. Forbes , director of the study , believes the results reflect " subtle and not so subtle forces-both within the education system and society in general-that affect female education achievement . " <P> SEX EQUALITY : Are Women Really for It ? No , says Rutgers Anthropologist Lionel Tiger . His new book Women in the Kibbutz ( Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; $10.95 ) , written with Israeli Anthropologist Joseph Shepher , argues that traditional sex patterns are so strong they have even overwhelmed the declared ideology of sexual equality in Israel 's rural collectives.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
