txt Illinois Supreme Court justice resigns in disgrace . Democrats charged with massive vote fraud . Governor hit for patronage abuse . State employes collect unearned pay . Rampant drinking in State Capitol . Wild spending lawmakers put Illinois millions of dollars in debt . For the last few years , Illinois newspapers have been full of stories like these , causing editorial writers to lament the decline of state government . But the government has not declined ; it has merely stayed more or less the same . The terrible happenings referred to above all took place between 1832 and 1842 , when one of our Illinois legislators was a young lawyer from Springfield named Abraham Lincoln . ACCORDING TO former Lt. Gov . Paul Simon , author of " Lincoln 's Preparation for Greatness , " and other Illinois historians , those were indeed scandalous times , little different from the modern era of Orville Hodge and Paul Powell except perhaps for being more colorful . The story of the Supreme Court justice is typical . As Gov . Thomas Ford 1842 to 1846 put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rascal , but no one knew it then , he having - been a citizen of the state only for about three weeks before he was elected . He was no lawyer . . . He was assigned to hold courts in the circuit on the Wabash , but being fearful of exposing his utter incompetency , he never went near any of them . In the course of one year he resigned his high office , but took care first to pocket his salary . . . He afterwards became a noted swindler , moving from city to city , and living by swindling strangers and prostituting his daughters , who were very beautiful . " ? ? CHARGES OF vote fraud were as loud and frequent then as in Mayor Daley 's time , and largely directed toward the same quarter . The Whigs complained that the Democrats stole Illinois for Martin Van Buren with fraudulent votes . In the words of one Whig : " We think that if the Irish did not vote more than three times we could easily carry the state . . . The Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " State Rep. Lincoln responded with a measure providing for " the severest penalty for the abuse of the elective franchise . " Lincoln , of course , was a Whig . Gov . Thomas Carlin 1838 to 1842 helped set the pace for many a future chief executive by padding the payrolls with patronage workers with the generous assistance of his fellow Democrats in the legislature . A Springfield observer wrote : " No state has been as badly governed as ours save Mississippi . . . Legislation with us is as unstable as the winds . The grand object seems to be to provide offices for partisans . " PATRONAGE WAS not unknown among the Whigs , tho . Lincoln , whose political maneuvering helped get the state capital moved from Vandalia to his hometown of Springfield , was influential in getting two of his friends , A. G. Henry and William Herndon , jobs as supervisors of the construction of the new Capitol . . Not everyone was pleased with their work . Complaints were made that their books were not kept properly and an investigating committee discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not work . The chaos , confusion , brawling , and boozing that has marked many of our recent legislative sessions is nothing new . After " debate " over partisan reorganization of the Illinois Supreme Court , one of Lincoln 's colleagues was said to have " sat down foaming and raging like a mad man . " House Speaker W. Robert Blair 's penchant for bad temper is merely following a trend set by the likes of William L. D. Ewing , speaker in the 1839-1840 session whose shouting match with an opponent " came very near to fighting a duel . " A LOCAL newspaper described how one lawmaker cast his vote : " He went into the House drunk , gave the vote in the same condition , and in retiring from the House fell off the stair steps and injured himself . " Being unable to walk to the House , he provided his party friends to pack him up stairs . and lay him on a couch in one corner of the House , and in this position he voted the second time for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numb e r of chickens , turkeys , oysters , etc. , that has disappeared since the meeting of the legislature is incalculable . . . The number of gallons of Irish whiskey . . . would , if collect ' ed in one grand reservoir at the head of the Sangamon River and let loose , overflow the whole region . " THE N 0 R T li WESTERN Gazette and Galena Advertiser lamented : " We anticipate that the state will derive no benefit from its the legislature 's labors . " The Alton Telegraph called the legislature " disgraceful and disastrous , " just as The Tribune did a few weeks ago . The Alton Gazette said that one session should be adjourned " immediately after it assembles . " " No state could be in much worse condition than ours at present , " summed up the Sparta Democrat . Lincoln neither drank the lie led a successful fight against prohibition in Innis nor smoked he had a rule adopted banning smoking in the House chambers and otherwise distinguished himself from his colleagues by refusing to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some aspects of Lincoln 's legislative career which were not so distinguished . WHILE THE NEW Capitol was being built , the legislature met in various Springfield churches of all places . At a meeting in one of them , Democrats were trying to adjourn a controversial special session that was not going their way . They needed a quorum before they could put the adjournment resolution to a vote , however , so Lincoln did the expedient thing . He took two of his Whig colleagues and jumped out the window . An opposition newspaper subsequently suggested that they build the new Capitol one story higher . THE WORST BLOT on Lincoln 's and the legislature 's record was the infamous Internal Improvements Act  --  the biggest boondoggle in Illinois history . At a time when state tax rev enues were less than $100,000 a year , Lincoln and others pushed thru a $15-million bond , issue program to build a politically popular network of railroads , highways , and barge canals . Every district got at least one , but none of them really went anywhere and all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $800,000 a year . ATONE POINT , Illinois had only $92.16 in the treasury while in debt to the tune- of $15.1 million . The debt , which ultimately reached $17 million because of unpaid interest , was not paid off until 1882 , long after many of the projects had gone to dust . As bad as it was , the legislature did achieve one distinction : Of the lawmakers who served in that 10-year period , three became governors , eight became congressmen , six became senators , one became a cabinet member , two became Presidential candidates , and one became President  --  a contribution to national politics that no Illinois legislature since has been able to rival .
