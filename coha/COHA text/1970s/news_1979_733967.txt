txt DEEP UNDER ill : , Standard Oil Building sat a voice without a face . He was relieved to be taking a break from his job and said so . " I 'm Mark Benson , " the voice said . " B like in boy , E-N-S-O-N . " He laughed at the way he 'd given his name . -I guess I sound like an operator , do n't I , spelling it out ? " Outside the little meeting room was the larger operations room , decorated in behavioral sciences yellow , where lights flashed and data banks clicked and 43 people in headsets earn manned a computer display terni , a/ and talked softly . The scene could have been CIA headquarta-s in Langley . Va. , but in fact it Close-up With Jeff Lyon was Illinois Bell 's Lake Shore Directory Assistance Office . It was a special day for Illinois Bell , because Mark 's salary bad just been underwritten by you and me . Thursday // Ma Bell rings changes in the numbers game // was the day Bell began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agree with them doing this , " Benson said . " There 's an awful lot of abuse of directory assistance . We get a lot of crazy calls like ' Do you know if the schools are closed ' tomorrow ? ' We do n't know something like that . All we can do is give out the school board 's number . Or how about , ' Do you know when my plane is taking off from O'Hare ? ' " I had one lady call during the holidays asking if I had the recipe for hot buttered rum . I said I did n't . ' Oh , just yell out to anyone around you and see if they know , ' she said . Now that was all they bad to catch me doing was yelling for the recipe for hot buttered rum . " I think this new fee will make people think a little before calling us . Money talks . " How much it talks remains to be seen . Beginning now , most Bell customers will get eight free information calls a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 cents for each query after that . Calls from hospitals , hotels , and pay phones , and those outside the customer 's area code are exempt . People physically unable to use directories may apply for exemption . TWENTY CENTS for information is n't a lot of money . But you can buy a newspaper for only 15 cents , and there 's a lot more information in there . There 's no telling how phone users are going to play this one . " We have n't noticed that the volume of calls is down any today , " said June Lambertino , manager of the office . " In fact , it 's up . There 's very heavy volume today due to the weather . The CTA 's all messed up and people want to call them . And they want numbers for cab companies and tow trucks . We had hoped there would be a dropoff today , but we probably wo n't see it until February when the first bills go out and people realize how much it 's going to cost them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . " I started with the company in 1949 , back in the manual days , when you did n't dial ; you picked up your phone and waited for the operator to say , " Number , please . " She surveyed her domain , where her operators worked in clusters of four in seating arrangements that resembled cutup tomatoes . Each operator has a large wedge-shaped desk , separated from the others by Plexiglas . " WHEN I started out , it was elbow to elbow . We all sat in a long row and there was no room to move . " We just finished computerizing all of directory assistance last year , " she said . " Before that all the offices were on.paper . We 'd sit there surrounded by six open phone books . We always left them open in the middle , with the A-L pages on one side and the M-Z pages on the other , because they were too heavy to keep opening from scratch . " We used a special page-turning technique called the ' flip , sweep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could turn to a spot in the book that was only two or three pages from the name she was looking for . " Now it 's all changed , of course . Millions upon millions of Chicago area phone numbers are contained on little strips of film called microfiche . The equivalent of 50 pounds of phone books , a featherweight cartridge loaded with microfiche is simply locked into place inside each machine . In the old days , a couple of times a week a guy would come to each of Bell 's 20 directory assistance offices , dragging heavy suitcases . Inside would be bound copies of new listings and updated old listings . The job held high potential for heart disease . Today the same man arrives with everything in his side pocket , in a little envelope . Every time you call for directory assistance , the operator goes micrefichings . First he or she hits the keyboard for the book needed  --  north suburban , south suburban , city , etc.  --  and then types the first four letters of the name you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the page flashes up . The operator scans the magnified print with a plastic marker , reads off the number , and is ready for the next call . Average elapsed time : 35 seconds . EACH OPERATOR handles more than 500 calls daily . The office itself , which shares geographic duties with another office , is party to answering 120,000 queries each weekday . " There 's a tremendous cost to the company 570 ? million per year to operate all of this , " June Lambertino said . " Each one of those microfiche viewers costs $7,000 . Every year salaries and benefits go up for our operators . And yet this has always been a free service . We 've never gotten any revenue from it . " We simply could not keep on spending this kind of money to give this service and get nothing in return . We 're not trying to get people to use directory assistance less . We just want to offset our costs . " OPERATOR Cindy Wright unplugged her headset and climbed out of her chair . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a number of customers ask me if the thing 's started today , " she said . " They want to know how much it 's going to cost . They even want to know how to use the phone book , like how to look up City Hall . " None of them seem to like the idea of paid directory assistance . And they do n't like it when you tell them that beginning now you 'll only give out one listing per call , instead of three like we used to . But I explain that now we 'll give out addresses as well as phone numbers . They like that . " I do n't think anybody was really mad about the whole thing . Let 's just say they were , uh , disappointed . "
