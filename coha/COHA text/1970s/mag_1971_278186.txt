TRANSATLANTIC travelers whose passports relegate them to over-29 status can also take their trips for less than standard fare . They must usually sacrifice some mobility , plan well in advance and sort through a bewildering maze of ticket prices . The variety is so great that each passenger in a six-across row of a 707 airliner may have paid a different amount for his ticket . The round-trip New York-London economy fare in peak season is $555 , and the price is just about the same for trips between London and Montreal , Boston , Philadelphia , Baltimore or Washington . Some ways a traveler can get a better deal : CHARTER FLIGHTS offer the cheapest fares but also involve the most restrictions ( although some are frequently ignored ) . Any nontravel organization at least two years old can charter a plane and sell the seats at cost to members of at least six months standing . Average tab : $230 . Most members of teachers , lawyers , fraternal or many other organizations qualify , and an ingenious travel agent can usually find some charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers , but less than a full planeload can reserve space on regularly scheduled airlines for $277 per seat under a plan called " group affinity fares . " GROUP INCLUSIVE TOURS are 14-to 21-day travel packages put together by airlines and travel agents . The group must include at least 15 people , but these are usually assembled by the packager . The main requirement is that at least $100 worth of " ground arrangements , " such as car rentals or hotels , must be bought along with the air ticket , which itself costs $305 . Two free stopovers are permitted both en route to and on return from the main destination . EXCURSION FARES are available to anyone who agrees to linger fairly long abroad . The fare for trips lasting 17 to 28 days is $385 ; for those of 29 to 45 days , it is $335 . As a rule , a total of five stopovers are permitted on the shorter excursions and a total of three on those of longer duration . <P> Vacationers can save up to 20% on many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , " which generally covers the summer months . In addition , anyone who does not mind a one-hour stopover in Reykjavik can cross the Atlantic for $279 on a peak-season 29-to 45-day ticket by flying Icelandic , the only non-IATA airline regularly running between North America and Western Europe . But its jetliners land only in Luxembourg . If the fare is still too steep , the prospective traveler has one final choice : he can try to go to work for an airline , most of which offer employees 90% reductions after six months of work .
