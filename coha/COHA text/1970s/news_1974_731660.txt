txt President Ford apparently got what he wanted in his meeting at Vladivostok with Soviet party leader Leonid Brezhnev . This was the breakthrough needed to give hope of success to the currently bogged-down talks in Geneva on controlling the latest generation of nuclear weapons ( SALT 2 ) . The sticking point till now has been the inability to find a yardstick acceptable to both sides that could be used to measure the combination of quantity and quality in each side 's nuclear arsenal . In the days when nuclear weapons had a single warhead , straightforward counting of launchers and missiles was a satisfactory way of measuring . But multiple warheads on a single missile ( the MIRV ) have brought a new element into the picture ? the " quality " as well as the quantity of the bangs . Presumably what was agreed in Vladivostok opens the door to what Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger has called ' ' a conceptual breakthrough " ? a mutually acceptable formula for measuring quantity plus quality in the latest nuclear weapons . Tough talks ahead Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very difficult negotiation . But , " he adds , " we feel we are well down the road . " In reaching the verge of " put- ting a cap on the nuclear-arms race , " Dr. Kissinger forecasts that the United States will now be in a position to work for reduction of nuclear arms . Reasons for the breakthrough appear to be these : ? A growing anxiety on the part of the Russians that the United States was ahead and gaining ground in the nuclear-arms race . o The realization of both sides that they both already possessed nuclear capacity for overkill Many times over . ? The fear of both sides that the other might achieve a technological advance which would supply it with a first-strike capability ( of knocking the other out completely in a first strike ) ? thus making it very tempting for some eventual and irresponsible leader to launch a preemptive war . The basic essentials of the joint U.S.-Soviet statement on arms control , which sets the stage for the SALT negotiators to move forward when they again meet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides will be entitled to have a certain agreed total number of strategic-delivery vehicles . ? Both sides will be entitled to have a certain agreed total of intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles ( SLBMs ) equipped with MIRVs . ( These are the new-generation weapons with which each counts on hitting the other 's heartland in the event of nuclear war between them . ) // Ford-Brezhnev accord // The proposed agreement will cover the period from October , 1977 , through Dec. 31 , 1986 . It will include provisions for further negotiations beginning no later than 1980-1981 on the question of further limitations and possible reductions of strategic arms in the period after 1985 . Mr. Ford seems to have handled himself admirably in his hourafter-hour of head-on discussions with the tough-minded hard-bargaining Mr. Brezhnev . While one must , of course , depend on U.S. sources for such an assessment , it seems clear that top Ford aides ? and , particularly , Henry Kissinger ? were impressed by the way the President responded to his first test in summit diplomacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the press saw a Gerald Ford who talked easily and confidently with the veteran Soviet chief . But those who were inside these high-level sessions saythey discerned an important new development in summitry : two world-power leaders whose personal chemistry seemed to fit together beautifully , right from their first meeting . Further , these sources say , there is something about this new match-up of personalities which tends to lower the level of tension . They add that this , of itself , seems to augur well for the future meetings of these two men , the first to come next summer in the United States . The President 's entourage hopes his sizable diplomatic achievement here will silence those critics who were counseling him not to make his trip to the Far East at this time . ' Modesty urged But of a suggestion that the President should expect a triumphal homecoming , Dr. Kissinger said : " I think the President should be modest . The agreement will speak for itself . The back of this thing is broken . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
