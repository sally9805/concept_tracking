SHORTLY after the Australian Labor Party won power in last December 's election , a high U.S. Administration official was discussing the change with an Australian visitor . " Tell me , " he asked , " what 's this new Prime Minister of yours like-this fellow White-law ? " The visitor had barely finished pointing out that the fellow 's name was Whitlam when he was confronted by an inquisitive State Department expert . More interested in learning something about other members of the new Australian Cabinet , the expert remarked : " I 've already met your two top men-Mr . Gough and Mr. Whitlam . " <P> It is unlikely that anybody in Washington would make either faux pas these days , for Gough ( rhymes with cough ) Whitlam is stirring things up more than any Australian leader in years . Until recently , Australia resembled a sort of waltzing Matilda , content to glide through life on the strong arm of a big , steady date . To her escort-first Britain , then the U.S.-she was complaisant , undemanding and faithful . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often was . No more . The waltz is ended . Australia has started to rock , and to a beat that is her own . To the dismay of officials in Washington , imitation has given way to innovation , reaction to action . Most remarkably , it has all happened in less than four months , since the election of the first Labor Party government in 23 years , and the installation of hard-driving Gough Whitlam , 56 , as Prime Minister . <P> Just a Start . Within 30 minutes of his swearing-in ceremony , Whitlam set the whirlwind tone for a new , independent-minded Australia by announcing the abolition of the military draft , introduced in 1964 to supply Australian troops for the war in Viet Nam . That was just a start . In foreign affairs , a Cabinet portfolio that he gave himself , Whitlam quickly took a whole series of moves to make Australia 's stance " less militarily oriented and not open to suggestions of racism . " <P> To the first end , he sent a strong personal note to President Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with China , North Viet Nam and East Germany ; he ordered the remaining Australian servicemen home from Viet Nam ( and granted amnesty to those who had dodged the draft ) ; he supported the concept of a neutralized zone in Southeast Asia ; he announced he would petition the International Court of Justice in an attempt to stop French nuclear tests in the South Pacific . ( A number of similar steps were taken by Fellow Laborite Norman Kirk , who won power in New Zealand just a week before Whitlam 's victory . ) <P> To the second end , Whitlam backed U.N . resolutions against white-supremacist Rhodesia and South Africa and banned visits to Australia by segregated athletic teams . Perhaps more significantly , Whitlam abruptly abolished the " white Australia " policy that had long discriminated against colored immigrants . He also took steps to improve the lot of Australia 's own long-abused aborigines ; among other things , he acknowledged aboriginal claims to ancient tribal lands .                  @ @ @
