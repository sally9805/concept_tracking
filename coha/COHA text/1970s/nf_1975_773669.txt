txt 7/ Flowers FLOWER GROWING ON THE HOMESTEAD REQUIRES FOREthought , self-discipline and diplomacy . The question is whether to grow flowers as a cash crop or for your own pleasure . You may think the question is whether to grow flowers or not . Although a clear-cut yes or no decision can be made and adhered to as to lawns and livestock , flower growing is unavoidable , irresistible , addictive and insidious . You may make a firm no-flowers rule , as I did , on the grounds that flowers are inedible time and space consumers . Then a neighbor divides his poppies and shares them with you . A friend sends a gift package of spring bulbs . The bank returns your canceled checks and encloses a packet of zinnia seeds . This is how flowers sneak onto the homestead . Then , in winter , the seed catalogs arrive with their colored pictures and rapturous descriptions . Before you know it , you have ordered candytuft to edge the poppy bed and a subtler zinnia to replace the rather garish variety the bank supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite places . Try to fit your first flowers into the small spaces between driveways and buildings . You can make flower beds close to young trees and shrubs . I planted a spruce hedge to shield the vegetable garden from the prevailing west wind . The spruces were three feet tall and I had room for several dozen pansies between the trees and the driveway . The pansies required frequent watering and weeding ; so , while caring for 1 O O FLOWERS them , I was also taking excellent care of the evergreens . Now , four years later , the spruces are over five feet tall and are nicely filling in circumference the bed allotted to them . Ivy now fills the few bare spaces . It thrives in the shade of the spruces , is perennial , and demands little care . Any pansies grown now will be for sale . Keep in mind that flowers require water and weeding to do well . Flower beds far from a water supply must be watered by hand during dry spells . The ideal way to manage distant flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-soaked bed and mulch at once . The mulch conserves the moisture , prevents most weeds from growing , and makes easy the removal of those few that do push through . When you set aside a plot or allow a row or two in the vegetable garden for flowers , it is time to decide whether to grow flowers as a cash crop . If you like to grow flowers and if you have a market ( roadside stand , farmers ' market , nearby agreeable grocer or florist ) , you can raise flowers as a cash crop . If you decide not to grow flowers as a cash crop , you must exercise self-discipline and limit your flower beds so that their care and space are kept to a minimum . Whether you grow flowers for sale or not , you must practice diplomacy in order not to be overwhelmed with plants you do not want or need and can not sell or keep . Apartment-dwelling friends will want to give you amaryllis bulbs after they have flowered , poinsettias after Christmas , six-foot avocado trees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in operation , friends view it as a convalescent home for dessicated gardenias , drooping aphelandra and any other sickly , spindly plants that would benefit from a few weeks of light , warmth and humidity . You can ward off many donations by mentioning from time to time how crowded the greenhouse is . Plants that appear suddenly from car trunks and tote bags must be dealt with firmly . Examine the new arrival . If it seems healthy , plant it . If it is only suitable for the greenhouse or lathhouse , tell the donor quite frankly that you do n't have room for the plant , but that you will try to find it a good home . ioi HOMESTEADING If the new arrival has aphids or scale , or looks generally unhealthy , isolate it or burn it . Do not risk infecting your greenhouse , frames or gardens . Quite enough problems will drift in on their own without deliberately importing them . Flowers as a cash crop fall into several categories : summer bedding plants , pot plants , perennial roots , cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , petunias and scarlet sage for sale in spring at garden centers and supermarkets are summer bedding plants , colorful annuals that must be planted anew each year . Most bedding plants are seeded in the greenhouse in January or February and are ready for sale by mid-April to the end of June . I grow a few bedding plants for sale ? marigolds , ageratum , patience ( Impatiens ) and begonias , usually . As a major source of income , annual bedders are a poor cash crop ? at least for the beginning homesteader ; there are too many established professional growers who know what they are doing and are hard for the novice to compete with , annuals are so cheap that you must grow them on a large scale to make money , and anything on a large scale requires equipment and labor . The beginning homesteader will probably have only one greenhouse and no outside help . My advice is to sow a flat or two of annuals . Plant some for your own enjoyment and sell the rest at the farmers ' market or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a flat of ageratum and one of dwarf marigolds for planting in sunny spots , a flat each of begonias and patience for shade . To make annual growing on such a small scale pay , you must do things a little differently from the commercial grower . For example , through April and May , marigolds are commonly sold in packs of a dozen plants at a dollar a pack . However , if in March you plant your marigold seedlings in individual fourinch pots and set them in the cold frame , they will make beauti1 0 2 FLOWERS ful , bushy , blooming specimen plants that will sell for 50 cents apiece in May and June . Thus eight dozen marigolds marketed the commercial way will gross $8 ; individually potted , 96 marigolds will gross $48 . People buy the larger plants in May and June to replace plants in a border or to keep in pots on a patio or terrace . Meanwhile , the seedlings have taken very little expensive greenhouse space , having done most of their growing in the unheated cold frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sell the rest . I grow marigolds every year to plant among the vegetable plants to discourage insects . The low-growing , bushy types ( Redhead , King Tut , etc. ) are especially good for both the garden and as potted plants . Ageratum , annual pinks , dwarf asters , verbena and candytuft also sell well as specimen plants . If you sow a flat of snapdragons , zinnias , calendula , cosmos , etc. for your own garden , you will almost always have more plants than you can use . By all means sell the surplus in packs of six or a dozen . These plants do not make attractive specimen plants . If you grow an unfamiliar variety , check the height and growth habit . Try to find a picture of an individual plant to see whether it is worth growing for sale . The Park seed catalog has a very useful list of all plants offered that gives height and bloom time . Bedding plants that require no greenhouse space are perennial alyssum , perennial candytuft , hostas and sempervivum ( hens-and-chicks ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning the following year , sell potted divisions in spring . I pot and put in the cold frame alyssum and candytuft divisions about one month ( mid-March ) prior to selling . They will begin to bloom earlier than the plants in the open bed and are quite attractive in four-inch pots by mid-April . I divide hostas in early spring when the first shoots appear . Three or four small divisions potted in March will make lovely full pots by the end of April and sell well through June at a dollar apiece . Hens-and-chicks are the easiest of all my bedding plants . The small new plants with their complete root system willingly part from the parent plant at a gentle pull . They are simply io3 HOMESTEADING stuck into two-inch pots , watered , and sold next day . They are foolproof , hardy and popular . Children often buy one ; adults often buy a dozen at a time to plant in rock gardens or strawberry jars . Wax-leaf begonias and patience make good bedding plants for shady or partially shady beds and borders . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begonia and one of patience in the greenhouse . They will come through the winter well on a windowsill that gets only the morning sun . I take cuttings from these plants through March and April . The cuttings root rapidly and are saleable after one month in three-inch pots at 50 cents apiece . Bushy blooming begonias in four-inch pots after two months sell well at a dollar apiece . Since wax-leaf begonias seem to do well for many people as houseplants , I have begun to keep a supply of various sizes on hand for sale year round . You will need a greenhouse to keep the plants for winter markets . The cuttings you make in August and September can often be made from recently rooted cuttings that are growing too tall . Merely pinch off the topmost growth , dip in a rooting powder , and pot . Pansies are popular in early spring . I grew them for myself my first year in the country . You prepare a bed and sow the seed in July . You have to keep them well watered and weeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed . From that point on they pretty well take care of themselves . By October you will have a mass of fat green plants and a few flowers . After the first good frost , mulch the bed lightly with straw or salt hay . The following March you dig the plants out with a trowel and put them in plant packs ? six or twelve to a pack . Try to get the entire root system and as much soil clinging to the roots as possible . Press good garden soil around the plants so the pack is nicely filled . Water the packs well and set in the cold frame . The pansies will start to grow at once and will usually be ready for sale in a week . By mid-April , pansies can be sold directly from the bed . Some growers have a digyour-own policy . Customers are given a trowel , a shallow carton and a burlap bag to kneel on . Evidently they enjoy choosing their own plants . 104 FLOWERS You can have a beautiful display of summer bedding plants at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants and varieties . Picture a selection of orange and crimson marigolds , bronze-leaf begonias with double pink blossoms , green-leaf begonias with white flowers , a tidy row of small pots of hens-and-chicks . On a lower shelf you might have delicate patience flanked by robust hostas , and on the ground , well-filled packs of blue ageratum , yellow alyssum , white candytuft and multicolored pansies . A cheerful display of well-grown plants draws people to a flea market booth . Although many flea market antique dealers sell some plants , they seldom take the care to market them in a professional way . Too often one sees drooping plants that have been too recently planted too deep in a makeshift container . Sell your plants in clean pots . Pot well ahead of market day any that may suffer transplant shock . Set the plants in their pots so that the stem emerges from the ground not more than half an inch from the top of the pot . Offer for sale only well-grown , healthy plants . Many customers will ask questions . Tell them all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their hardiness . The customer who wants to put a marigold on his shady patio will appreciate your honesty when you tell him it requires full sun and will not thrive in shade . You may have lost a sale , but you will have gained his confidence . My experience is that he will be back to buy other plants and he will recommend you to friends and neighbors . POT PLANTS FROM THE GARDEN IF YOU HAVE a greenhouse , you can have pot plants in bloom for sale year round . Without a greenhouse you can have some pot plants for sale from late May to early October . I will deal here in some detail with scented geraniums , ornamental peppers and cushion chrysanthemums ? all of which can be raised without a greenhouse . // Geraniums : Common geraniums are commonly sold from Easter to mid-June for beds , borders and window boxes . I do n't want to grow common geraniums on a large scale , so I grow uncommon types on a small scale and sell them as potted specimen plants . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geraniums all year long . I have i i kinds of scented geraniums ? varieties whose leaves smell strongly of peppermint , roses , nutmeg , apple , lemon , etc. , and two varieties , so far , of Lady Washington geraniums . This meant that before the greenhouse I had 13 stock geranium plants to house over the winter . If you do n't have sufficient window space , buy a plant light . Unusual geraniums are well worth the investment . Take as many cuttings as you can without endangering the health of the stock plant in March . By the end of April these first cuttings will be ready to pot and sell . Usually by mid-April in most of the Northeast you can plunge ( sink pot rim-deep in earth ) your stock plants in a sheltered sunny spot and put your cuttings in the cold frame . Both will begin to grow rapidly . If you plan to have plants for sale until October , continue to take cuttings until the end of August . I like to have all varieties for sale in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pots for 65 cents , those in four-inch pots for $1 . I find the most popular kinds are the rose-scented ( Attar of Roses , Shrubland Rose , Old Fashioned Rose and Cinnamon Rose ) , lemon and peppermint . Least popular of those we offer are southernwood-scented and Apricot ? both of which smell peculiar to many and downright unpleasant to some . But the same person who finds these varieties uninteresting at the beginning of spring will often buy them in mid-summer because he has become a collector . He still does n't like them much , but he wants them just to have them . For the same reason , I will add coconut- , strawberry- and pine-scented geraniums to my own collection . Most of the scented geraniums do best in full sun . However , peppermint-scented does best for me plunged in its pot on the north side of the greenhouse where it gets only early morning and late afternoon sun . Peppermint geranium also requires io6 FLOWERS more water than the other varieties and its cuttings are slower to root . I try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants each of the popular varieties in three-inch pots , five of each in fourinch pots , and two each of the less popular in three-inch pots only . Ideally , I thus have 94 scented geranium plants for sale each week . If I sell only one-third of them , the geraniums bring in a little over $20 a week . I often sell half or more . If you have a plant that does not sell and is getting too large even for a fourinch pot , remove it from the plants for sale . If your stock plant looks saleable , sell it and use the reject for a stock plant . Or give it to a friend or neighbor . Geraniums are more interesting than most people know . You may be more attracted to miniatures , rosebud geraniums , fancy leaf types , ivy geraniums or what are known as " odd geraniums " ? a catchall classification that includes succulent type , square-stalked geraniums , carnation-flowered , trailing pansy types and such beguiling names as Star of Persia , Southern Cross and Finger Flowered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , you must advertise and explain a bit more than if you have the familiar varieties . I have a small sign hand-printed on heavy white cardboard that says simply SCENTED GERANIUMS , and lists the varieties and the prices . If I forget the sign , few people will ask about the plants . They read the sign and say to you , " I never heard of them . " You explain , they smell the leaves , look at the flowers and buy the ones they like . Of course you get a certain number of customers who recognize the scent leaves and buy , sign or no sign . Aside from their decorative and novelty value , the leaves of scented geraniums can be used in potpourri and to flavor jellies . A small piece of rose geranium leaf in each jar of apple jelly imparts a rich rose taste . The best sources I know for obtaining scent-leaf and other unusual geraniums are Wilson Brothers , Roachdale , Indiana 46172 , and Merry Gardens , Camden , Maine 04843 . Ornamental Peppers : Ornamental peppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My first ornamental // pepper was a gift , a handsome small bush that had grown too large for a friend 's windowsill . I plunged it beneath the kitchen window , enjoyed it all summer and , in fall , when it was covered with bright orange fruit , gave it to a friend who had a greenhouse . In spring I discovered clumps of peppers growing in a circle where the pepper had been . I potted up 50 or more . By July some were in bloom and I sold them in four-inch pots at $I . By September I was selling the rest in eight-inch pots at $2.50 apiece . Thanks to the greenhouse I now have some Christmas peppers for sale through January . The Christmas cherry or Jerusalem cherry ( Solanum pseudo-capsicum ) seed is sold by Park Seed Company in three varieties : orange , yellow and scarlet fruit . When I have more greenhouse space , I intend to try ornamental peppers ( Capsicum annuum ) also available from Park Seed in seven varieties including one , Black Prince , with black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , will sell well mainly because they are not generally offered for sale in my area . If decorative peppers are common as petunias in your area , you had better think twice before growing them as a cash crop . Chrysanthemums : Cushion chrysanthemums are easy to raise as pot plants . You simply root tip cuttings from your stock plants in late May . I only have four colors of mums ? lavender , yellow , crimson , and white . I put about 30 cuttings of each to a flat , put the flats in the lathhouse where they will get watered regularly , and leave them alone otherwise until early June when they are ready to pot and set out in their growing bed . Until August I I keep the potted plants pinched ? that is , pinching off the growing tips so as to produce more blooms on a nicely rounded , bushy plant . Of course , the growing bed must be kept weeded and watered . I sell most of the mums as pot plants in October and early November . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have to have them in bloom on schedule , which may require shortening their days by covering the plants with cloth or black plastic . This requires frames to be built , costs money , takes time , and is unsightly . 1 o8 FLOWERS I began selling mums almost by accident . I was short of plants to take to the antique market one fall and decided to pot up some of the cushion mums from the garden . I sold most of them while they were still sitting on the tailgate of the truck waiting to be unloaded . Passersby , attracted by the bright flowers and pleased by the country prices , bought them on sight . The roots of mums form a wide shallow mass so they require wide shallow pots . Eight- or ten-inch bulb pans are best ; azalea pots will do . PERENNIALS ONCE YOU HAVE DABBLED successfully in annuals , you will begin to linger longer in the perennial pages of the plant catalogs . Most perennials do not flower the first year , so if you grow them from seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through their first season . Your reward will be the money you save . A 50-cent packet of named variety delphinium seed , for example , can easily produce 75 plants . If you buy the plants , they will cost you at least one dollar apiece . Many perennials are considered more difficult to grow than annuals . The seeds may take longer to germinate and the young plants grow more slowly but , once established , good perennials are things of beauty and joys for quite a while . You may not yet have a greenhouse or sufficient windowsill space to sow perennials in early spring . However , many kinds can be sown from spring to fall out of doors . Check the sowing dates carefully in your catalog or garden book for the varieties you decide to raise . Some perennial seeds will not germinate unless they have been frozen ; others germinate unevenly over a long period of time . Most perennials will succeed if you can meet their requirements . Raising from seed varieties known to be difficult ( peonies , some iris , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are especially expensive . If you want to grow them in any number , buy your plants as soon as you can so you can divide them next season and thus soon have well-filled beds and borders with the least expense . // Whether you grow your perennials from seed or buy the plants , the day will come when you have more plant divisions than you have room for . You can give them away , compost them or sell them . Perennials from your own garden will not pay off the mortgage , but you may as well let them pay their way . I pot up one-year-old perennial alyssum , Shasta daisy and candytuft to sell at the farmers ' market in spring . In August I sell iris roots ( named varieties ) when the beds are dug and replanted . I sell some clumps of monarda ( bee balm ) , pinks , columbine and Nepeta mussini ( mauve catmint ) ? all to visitors who see them growing and buy on impulse . Last spring for the first time I potted up Poker plant ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold well at the farmers ' market in June for $1.50 each . Perennials I intend to grow from seed in future and eventually sell are pyrethrum , scabious , delphinium and rudbeckia . I will buy named variety plants of phlox , hemerocallis , Oriental poppies and helenium so that whether propagated by divisions or root cuttings , the new plants will be true to type . I have the perennial garden for my own pleasure , so the selections are my own preferences . I merely sell the leftovers . If you want to grow perennials as a cash crop on a more substantial scale , learn about them in depth and survey your market . If a good percentage of your potential customers live in new housing developments , be cautious . Many of these new homeowners are former apartment dwellers and know little about flowers or gardening . Their first flowers will be mostly annuals ? marigolds and petunias blooming brightly in packs at the supermarket or garden center . Unless you can show them your beds in bloom , they are not likely to buy dormant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many homes with spacious grounds and velvety lawns , you probably have a good local market for well-grown , choice perennials . If your own perennial growing must be confined to a relatively small area , you might consider specializing in small pe- Iio FLOWERS rennials that are suitable for small gardens and rock gardens such as arabis , aubrieta , rock jasmine and armeria . For your own satisfaction as well as that of customers , label beds or tag plants individually so that when they are not in bloom you can be sure of colors and variety names . Add the tasks of perennial care to your calendar ? dates for planting seeds , ordering plants , dividing clumps and taking cuttings . Some perennials can become nuisances . In my area three flowers , evidently grown in gardens originally , have escaped to become pests ? globe thistle , datura and coreopsis . If you are struck by the catalog description of a plant you know nothing of , look it up in the book of an unbiased expert who has nothing to sell . You may find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catalog states . Or you may find that " hardy " is a euphemism for ineradicable and that " fast growing " means invasive . CUT FLOWERS OCCASIONALLY I SELL bunches of cut flowers ? chrysanthemums and asters in fall , daffodils in spring , iris and Shasta daisies , scabious , columbine and pinks in summer . But the flower cutting is usually done by young enthusiasts early on a flea market morning and is not a regular practice or source of income . Unless you have greenhouses , hired help , a florist to sell to , and lots of expertise , I advise you to stay out of the cut-flower business . It is difficult to produce a specific number of fine flowers on schedule . If you have a diversified stall at the flea market , sell flowers when you have them and have the time to gather them . As a rule , fresh-cut flowers as a cash crop are too tricky , too demanding and too perishable for the diversified homestead . In case you are still tempted to make cut flowers a cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Faber and Faber , 1953 ) , especially chapter 6 , which deals // with the growing of flowers for sale , picking , bunching , packing and problems . Mr. Robinson gives you a good glimpse at the complexities and pitfalls of the cut-flower trade . DRIED FLOWERS DRIED FLOWERS ARE care-free cut flowers . They are easy to grow and , once harvested , you can sell them when you like . I find dried flowers sell best from mid-November to the beginning of February when fresh-cut flowers are scarcest and most expensive . Books and articles on dry arrangements claim that practically every flower and leaf can be preserved . However , many flowers require drying in borax or commercial drying compounds and when dry are too fragile to survive much handling . Some leafy materials require treatment with glycerine or mineral oil to keep them supple . I do not bother with difficult or delicate dried flowers . My best seller is the giant crested cockscomb . I sell about 100 of these flowers between Thanksgiving and Christmas . The ones that are a foot or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This year I am going to devote two garden rows to cockscombs which should yield about 600 flowers for sale . I sow cockscomb in the greenhouse about March 1 and transplant to the garden about May 15 . The way to grow them large and fat is to give them plenty of water regularly , as well as plenty of fertilizer , and to root-prune them to induce many small roots at the base of the plant . The bed must be kept scrupulously weeded . When the flowers are fully developed , I cut the stalks as close to the ground as possible , strip off the leaves , and hang the flowers upside down from the rafters of the house workroom . In a month or so the stems harden and turn brown . The flowers can be sold from this point on . I also grow Chinese lanterns . This hardy perennial will spread , so grow it where it will not crowd other plants . Lunaria , which you may know as Peter 's Pence or Silver Dollar , is easy 1 1 2 FLOWERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering from the vanes is tedious work . If the supply of free child labor dries up , I doubt that I will still grow lunaria . The cockscombs , Chinese lantern and lunaria are grown to be sold , but I also sell some dried baby 's breath from the garden and dried okra pods . I gather cattails in July from a nearby marsh and leathery , multicolored fungi from the woods . A planting of six bittersweet vines this year yielded their first crop of berried branches for sale . Strawflowers and statice are among the dried materials most commonly seen in florist shops and boutiques , which is why I do n't grow them . If these everlastings are not common in your area , they may be a worthwhile cash crop . Look around your land to see if there are any plants or branches that are interesting in late fall . I have sold small , corky-barked gum-tree branches , gum-tree seeds , pine cones , driftwood , the dried stalks of weeds such as great mullein and curly dock , plus some plants whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in value with time . One year I had some cockscombs left over . They stood in the workshop until the following fall , where their rich crimson color faded to a dusky rose . When I was packing for the antique market , I nearly threw out the old flowers , but at the last minute decided to take them along . I had in mind selling them for 50 cents apiece . I went for coffee while my friend , Bimbo , was setting up the booth . By the time I returned Bimbo had sold the faded cockscombs for $3 apiece . She had seen with an unprejudiced eye that their color was every bit as beautiful as that of the new flowers and twice as unusual . She had displayed the old flowers separately , marked their outrageous price boldly , and sold them all in a matter of minutes . 1 1 3 8/ Other Plants as Cash Crops WE WILL HERE CONSIDER FOUR SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF plants to raise for sale : herbs , ground covers , plants for shade and bonsai stock . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow , require little work and little growing space , and occupy little or no space in the greenhouse . HERBS ABOUT 75 PERCENT of the herb plants I sell are common kitchen herbs . Herbs as a cash crop are best considered in two groups ? annuals and perennials . I sow for sale five culinary herbs as annuals each winter in the greenhouse : basils , oregano , marjoram , parsley and rosemary . There are many varieties of basil . I grow three ? green , purple and a lettuce-leaved , variegated type . Basil germinates easily , transplants well , and makes good growth provided it gets plenty of sun and regular watering . Basil sown February 15 in my cool greenhouse is saleable by April 15 in two-and-a-halfinch pots at 35 cents each . I sell larger plants in four-inch pots at 65 cents each until June I. Any basil not sold by that date is set out among my own tomato plants . By this time they are becoming too large for their pots . Since demand is now dwindling they are not worth potting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AS CASH CROPS Oregano is easily grown from seed and sells well from spring to late fall . In spring I sell plants in two-and-one-halfinch pots at 35 cents each ; in four-inch pots at 65 cents each . I plant in the garden 30 or 40 oregano plants for use fresh in the kitchen , for drying , and to keep the bees happy . In September I pot up the garden plants , now thick , low mats , in six-inch to teninch bulb pans and sell them in the city for $2.50 to $3.50 each . Marjoram , similar to oregano when very young , soon becomes bushy and erect . The leaves of marjoram are grayishgreen ; those of oregano a deep , true green . I sell marjoram plants until about July 1 , and then discard most leftover plants since I find they do not sell in fall as well as oregano . Parsley is slow to germinate and should be started around February 1 . I sell three-inch pots of parsley for 35 cents . Parsley forms a very long taproot that must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow parsley for sale and for transplanting into my own garden is to sow the seed directly into the pots . Some books and articles advise presoaking the seed to hasten germination . However , the wet seeds stick together and are messy to work with . I sow them dry , water the pots well , and keep the pots covered until the seedlings appear . Thereafter , I find that parsley does best on the cooler , shadier shelf beneath the bench rather than in full sun . In your own garden you can have a fresh supply of parsley all winter if , in fall , you wall in a block of four plants with bales of straw and cover the enclosure with a piece of coldframe sash or an old storm window . Failing this , you can dry parsley or freeze small packets for winter use in sauces , stews and soups . But frozen or dried will not do for garnishing , so do try to winter over a few plants . I have not succeeded in growing dill plants for sale . There must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised for sale in three or four herb catalogs . My experience is that the plants soon grow tall and fall over if they are not supported . I plant a good-size bed of dill and sell in bunches what I do not use for pickling in August and early September . Summer savory in this area does not sell well because it is 1 1 5 HOMESTEADING unfamiliar to most people . Nevertheless , I find that I am potting a few more plants each year for repeat customers and a sprinkling of new ones . Unless herb fanciers abound in your area , anise , coriander , chervil and other comparatively less familiar herbs will not sell well . This does not mean that you should not offer them for sale . By all means pot up a few of all the herbs you grow for yourself and display them at your roadside stand or flea market booth . You will sell some and the rest pay for themselves in the attention they attract . I raise and sell rosemary , a perennial herb , all year long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens or to use as a pot plant ; in winter , larger plants ( four-inch pots ) are bought by topiary and bonsai hobbyists . Perennial herbs are easy to propagate for sale provided you have stock plants in your own garden . I sell peppermint , spearmint and orangemint , hyssop , winter savory , southernwoods , thymes , balm , pennyroyal , tarragon ( roots ) and germander . I try to keep several of each ready for sale from May to September . I will provide burnet , chamomile , woad , lovage , sage and wormwood on order only , since there is no general demand for them and they do not have sufficient eye appeal for customers to buy them on impulse . Although I keep a bed each of chives and garlic chives for my own use , I do not grow them for sale . Supermarkets offer pint boxes of live chives for 39 cents . I do not feel that the labor and space required would allow me to sell them for less than 50 cents a box . Mail-order suppliers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Catalogs . " If you read more than one book on herbs , you may be confused by a multiplicity of names and differing information on propagation , exposure , growth habits and uses . Probably the best handbook for the new herb grower is the Handbook on Herbs published by the Brooklyn Botanic Garden ( see bibliography ) . Other books that I have found useful or interesting are also listed in the bibliography . X16 OTHER PLANTS AS CASH CROPS If you grow herbs for sale , you should know their names , common and scientific ; specific variety names ; exposure , soil and moisture requirements ; whether they are annual , biennial or perennial ; growth habits ; and maximum size at maturity . Of course , you should know their uses . This sounds like a lot to learn . However , after a little reading and a season of growing your own , you will find you have learned a good deal about herbs . This is good , for you will find that most of your customers know nothing and recognize only parsley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via an article or television program . They are full of questions . I tack up a sign in my flea market booth that says HERBS in large letters , beneath which I list the kinds I offer . I tag each plant with its name and price . Customers stop , look , and ask questions . An interesting assumption of many of my customers is that such herbs as oregano , marjoram and thyme must be dried ( i.e. , must look familiar ) before they can be used . Once assured these herbs can be used fresh , customers are often delighted to add something fresh and green to a diet that usually includes more and more of the frozen , the canned and the processed . Talk to customers and listen to them . Knowledgeable ones will pass on bits of folklore and tradition , regional names and favorite recipes . It is due to one such conversation that I , who swore I would never go primitive , now shampoo my hair with a decoction of southernwood . After three years of offering herb plants for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in a small way . I now have a few customers who come to the farm in spring to buy several dozen plants at a time . I am currently working on a large order of specimen perennial herbs for a professional garden designer . GROUND COVERS GROUND COVERS ARE perennial plants used in large numbers to cover the ground in areas where grass will not grow or where grass is difficult to maintain ( in shade , dry , sunny // banks , etc . ) . Many ground covers grow to a uniform height and are used instead of grass by gardeners who have tired of the vicissitudes of lawn management . The most commonly grown ground cover plants are easily propagated by division or cuttings . They require little care ? only occasional watering and weeding . Space and time to grow to saleable size are their principal needs , both of which are easily met on a country place . When the customer decides he wants to carpet a bank with ivy or cover a bare patch with bugle , he wants to do it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer to propagate 50 plants by next spring . Nor does he usually have the space for such a project , however willing he is to be thrifty . Whether sun lovers or shady types , most ground covers grow best in the partial shade and shelter of a lathhouse , which can be built from scrap lumber and saplings from the woods . Grow ground covers in large numbers . Customers seldom want one pachysandra ; they want them by the dozen or in 25-plant units . The easiest and most economical plants to begin with are ivies , periwinkle ( vinca minor ) , Japanese spurge ( pachysandra ) and bugle ( ajuga ) . You can grow them in plant bands , peat pots , plastic or clay pots . I have seen ground covers being grown in halved milk cartons and tin cans , but do not recommend such practices . Since the containers will be in the lathhouse bed for anywhere from six weeks for the fastrooting ivies to a year for slower types and holdovers , most of these makeshift containers are certain to decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with . About a month before your plants are ready to sell , put a sign by the road , an ad in the paper , or a notice in your flea market booth announcing that you are taking orders for , say , well-rooted English ivy plants at 3 for $1.10 , 25 for $7.50 . As the orders come in , make new cuttings so that you can replace the plants that are sold immediately . By keeping the beds filled , you cut down on the space available for weeds to grow and prevent pots from falling over . Any hardy perennial ground cover plants left over at the end of the season can be left in the bed and sold next year . 1 1 8 OTHER PLANTS AS CASH CROPS The profit in ground cover plants is quite high when one considers that there is practically no investment required and very little labor . A lathhouse bed measuring three feet by twelve feet holds 576 three-inch pots . Plant prices range from $1.25 each for bearberry to 15 cents apiece for pachysandra . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 35 cents . Thus a nine-by-twelve-foot bed can yield $201.60 a season even if it produces only one crop of each variety , which is unlikely if you stock any of the fast-growing varieties . Two hundred dollars for 576 plants does not seem like much unless you look at it from a time and labor point of view . It may take as long as an hour to assemble your pots or bands , flats to carry the new plants in and potting soil . By working quickly and with the least wasted motion , one person can make 600 cuttings in three hours , not necessarily consecutive . Two weeding sessions of one hour each from spring to fall are probably twice as much as needed , but I will assign two hours to weeding to be on the safe side . If the lath bed is free of weeds before the pots are inserted , and the pots are fitted close together in neat rows , weeds will not be a problem . When the cuttings are new , they will need to be sprayed daily for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thereafter , they usually require two waterings a week , so let us assign two hours for watering . Total work required from assembling pots to ready-for-sale plants takes eight hours . Viewed in this light , ground covers can pay you at the rate of $25 an hour . In actual practice your hourly rate may be even higher since guests can water and weed through most of the summer . You can establish beds of ivy , sedum and periwinkle at no cost . Simply ask friends , neighbors and relatives for cuttings . These three varieties are so common that you can be sure someone you know has a bed of each . You might also obtain hens-and-chicks , bugle , pachysandra and creeping phlox the same way . If you have to buy stock plants , practice catalog comparative shopping and check local nurseries . In one of last year 's catalogs bugle plants were offered at 20 cents apiece , in another at 85 cents for the same size plant . Both are reputable // houses , so it is safe to assume that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ground covers or orchids , cost money . Encourage customers to return all pots . I refund 25 cents for each six-inch pot returned . Tell friends , neighbors and relatives to collect pots regardless of size . My former landlady in Philadelphia collects pots for me from her garden club members and from the trash barrels in her neighborhood . Buy pots at country sales where a bushel basket full is often knocked down for a quarter . To pot I000 or so plants in the same size containers , you will probably have to buy them even if friends , neighbors and relatives are doing their best . Containers for ground covers are inexpensive if you buy them by the case . Plant bands ( foursided bottomless boxes ) cost between 2 and 3 cents apiece in broken lots , less than a cent apiece in cases of woo shipped f.o.b. from the factory . Peat pots by the case cost a little over z cents apiece . Three-inch-round plastic pots cost 11/2 cents apiece by the case . Even when the cost of shipping is calculated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that customers need ground covers for specific situations . Though a gardener may buy a geranium on impulse , he orders 25 or 50 ground covers with a clear plan for their use . The most common need is for a cover that flourishes in extreme light situations . Next , in my area at least , is a need for ground covers for acid soils ? to spread beneath oaks and amid plantings of laurel , holly or rhododendrons . Ground Covers for Sunny Locations : Here are six common ground covers for sunny locations that are easy and cheap to propagate and which sell well : Phlox subulata ( moss pink ) is a three-to-five-inch-high hardy perennial that blooms profusely ( white , pinks , and blues ) in season and forms a rich green mat the rest of the summer . Moss pink is easily propagated by means of cuttings and will tolerate partial shade . It is also used in rock gardens , in wall plantings , and in front borders or as an edging plant . Thymus serpyllum ( creeping thyme , mother-of-thyme ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost evergreen , fragrant when bruised , and attractive to bees when blooming . Thyme is easily rooted from cuttings , divided into clumps , or grown from seed . I pot up for sale the volunteer plants that show up in beds bordered by thyme . There are several varieties of prostrate thymes , not all of which are winter hardy , so be especially observant of specific names when you order a creeping thyme . Hardy Sedums ( stonecrop ) are exceedingly easy to root and various varieties are used as cover , in rock gardens , wall plants and specimen subjects . S. acre , S. rupestre and S. album are common species . Nepeta mussini ( mauve catmint , Persian mint ) , a charming member of the mint family , produces lavender-blue flowers in abundance through May and June , intermittently thereafter until frost . All my orders have come from visitors who saw it growing atop a retaining wall and spilling over the cobblestone border of the driveway . Bees love it . I grew the original plants from seed and have been dividing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells well and is easily propagated by division or cuttings . In fall the leaves turn a showy purple that remains through winter . Vinca minor ( periwinkle , myrtle ) can be propagated by cuttings or by potting a section of rooted stem . Periwinkle is a fast grower . In early spring the bright blue flowers contrast dramatically with daffodils and narcissus . Periwinkle does well in light shade and will survive in heavy shade but will not flower well . Ground Covers for Shade : Here are five easy ground covers that tolerate and flourish in various degrees of shade : Ajuga reptans ( bugle , bugleweed ) is propagated by division and grows rapidly . Variety atropurpurea with purplishbronze foliage is commonest , but variegated and greenleaf varieties are also available . Hedera helix ( ivies ) root by cuttings and by naturally layerrooted stem sections . Commonest are English and Baltic types . Some small-leaved compact types are good topiary subjects and have customer appeal year round . 1 2 1 HOMESTEADING Pachysandra terminalis ( Japanese spurge ) is a favorite ground cover under trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ceratostigma plumbaginoides ( plumbago ) is good for light shade and provides deep blue flowers in late summer when color in the gardens is often getting scarce . Asperula odorata ( woodruff ) is better known to herb gardeners generally but makes a good ground cover for a lightly shaded woodland . Cut and dried , woodruff gives a pleasant odor to linen closets and pillows . It is rather expensive to buy . Propagation is by lifting and separating the plants and potting up rooted segments . Ground Covers for Acid Soils : I live in an acid soil area ? my woods are full of oaks , laurels and holly . Customers have requested ground covers for this type of soil . They read about them in garden books but can not find them for sale locally . I plan to offer some acid-loving ground covers for sale . If you live in a similar area , you may want to do the same . Here are four suggestions : Arctostaphylos uva-ursi ( bearberry ) : This trailing shrub produces thick evergreen mats with white or pinkish flowers followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation but will tolerate light shade . Propagate by cuttings . In addition to : ts virtues as a ground cover , bearberry flowers are attractive to bees and the berries to grouse and over 30 other species of birds . Native to northern America , the dried leaves of bearberry were prized by Indians and woodsmen as a tobacco substitute called kinnikinnick , a word that still shows up in books on camping and survival in the wilderness . Cotoneaster : The variety dammeri is a prostrate form that is particularly effective on banks and among rocks . The variety microphylla ( small leaf ) is best used in small areas and rock gardens . Both of these cotoneasters are evergreen and hardy , and can be propagated from cuttings . Pay close attention to specific and variety names when you buy cotoneasters since there are varieties that form shrubs and even small trees . Leiophyllum buxifoliurn or L. Lyonii ( sand myrtle ) grows six to nine inches tall and has a compact habit of growth . 1 2 2 OTHER PLANTS AS CASH CROPS Evergreen and bearing white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject for ground cover or rock gardens in sandy , sunny , acid soil . Propagate by cuttings , layering or seeds . Calluna vulgaris ( Scotch heather ) and low-growing varieties of Erica ( heath ) are becoming more popular as ground covers for large areas where soil is acid , well drained and generally too poor to grow anything else easily . If such conditions exist in your area , you should consider growing heaths and heathers for sale since they are not yet generally available . Both the low-growing and taller varieties are worthy garden subjects . To locate sources of named varieties that suit your needs , see the latest edition of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden 's publication , Plants and Gardens : 1200 Trees and Shrubs ? Where to Buy Them ( Summer 1970 , new series , vol. 26 , no. 2 ) . If you decide to grow ground covers , whether for your own place or as a cash crop , do not buy on impulse plants with which you are not familiar . Catalog compilers are too often apt to employ scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus you will sometimes see Lonicera advertised as " a marvelous ground cover ? fast growing , bearing fragrant flowers in profusion . " Lonicera is honeysuckle , some varieties of which arc rampant growers that go where they are not wanted , strangle trees and shrubs , and are difficult to eradicate once established . Two others that I sec promoted with a fair degree of frequency are Lysimachia nummularia ( better known as moneywort ) and Nepeta Glechoma ( gill-over-the ground or creeping Jenny ) . Select the kinds of plants you want from unbiased sources ( books by experts ) or see them first hand in established plantings at botanical gardens . Order ground covers , as you would specimen trees or shrubs , by specific names from reputable growers . PLANTS FOR SHADE EVERY HOUSE HAS a north wall ; every tree and hedge casts a certain amount of shade . So many customers ask for // flowering plants that can tolerate shade that I decided to grow some shade lovers . The big three of colorful bedding plants for shade are waxleaf begonia , patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown from seed or cuttings . All three are usually offered by garden centers alongside petunias and marigolds so that many customers do not realize which plants can be used in shade . If you grow these varieties for sale , raise the fancy , unusual strains , whose seed is usually a little more expensive . When you take them to market , display them beneath a sign that tells their names and the fact that they are for shady spots . Lobelias are not so well known . The varieties Crystal Palace , Cambridge Blue and Bright Eyes ( all available from Burpee ) are good front border plants for shady beds . All bear blue flowers in August and September when garden color is diminishing . White and red varieties are also available . If you decide to propagate perennials for shaded gardens , a larger lobelia , L. cardinalis , is a sure seller ? especially if customers can see it in bloom in your own shaded garden . Hostas and lily-of-the-valley are good plants for shade . I have stock beds of both . I pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September and plunge them in the lathhouse bed . When they bloom in spring , I sell then . Pink lily-of-the-valley sells out each year at $i a pot . It is a good idea to divide your stock bed into four sections and divide for sale only one section a year . This gives each section a chance to grow thickly between division times . Hostas can be grown the same way . I prefer to bring them into the greenhouse in mid-February . By mid-March they are attractive pot plants that the customer can enjoy indoors until the weather is suitable for transplanting to the shaded garden . Supplying plants for shade can be a business in itself . Ferns , rhododendron , laurel and other flowering shrubs are good subjects for shade and are expensive . I do n't have the space or the time to take on any more cash crops , but as my own woodland garden takes shape , I am more tempted to abandon flowers as a cash crop to take up ferns and wildflowers . If you want to learn a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Gardening in the Shade ( Brooklyn Botanic Garden Record , Plants and Gardens , Autumn 1969 ) . Bonsai SHRUBS AND TREES GROWING SHRUBS and trees for sale to bonsai and topiary enthusiasts is profitable even if you have to buy all the plants . I grow only three types now ? juniper trees ; the herb , rosemary ; and an ivy ( Hedera helix conglomerata ) . In spring I collect seedling junipers from the woods , pot them , and plunge the pots in the lathhouse . In late summer I lift them and cut off any roots that are coming through the bottoms of the pots . The following spring the little trees are again removed from their pots , root-pruned , and repotted . Top pruning is limited to the removal of enough branches to simplify the outline of the tree and the heading back of too long shoots on those branches that are being retained . In fall I sell the trees , usually in three-inch pots for $5 each . Due to a shortage of lathhouse space I have only been doing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep an eye out for seedlings to pot up and keep on the floor of the greenhouse until there is room for them outside . For the three years that I have offered junipers for sale , I have sold out each season 's supply completely . Rosemary can be grown from seeds or cuttings and sells very well in the city year round . The ivy is grown from cuttings . Well-rooted bushy plants in two-and-one-half-inch pots sell at $1 each . As soon as the new lathhouse is complete , I will stock more junipers and try my hand at flowering quince , firethorn , forsythia and cotoneaster ? all of which I can grow from cuttings from my own plants . If there is money enough and time , I will buy seedling mugho pine , Japanese black pine , Zelhova ( a deciduous tree ) and false cypress ? all of which are available from good sources at one dollar or less apiece . Even native American species such as holly and forsythia appreciate in value by at least $2 a year . Traditional bonsai subjects like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $6 for each year of growth . For the small amount of time and space they require , bonsai materials are profitable to raise as long as the enthusiasm for them continues . I do not train bonsai plants at all . I merely root and top prune as advised by the articles and diagrams in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden Record , Plants and Gardens : Bonsai : Special Techniques ( Summer 1966 , vol. 22 , no. 2 ) . The pleasure , work and hazards of training are reserved for the customer . If your interest in bonsai develops beyond the small cash crop stage , you should read Bonsai for Americans by George F. Hull ( New York : Doubleday , 1964 ) . For a study of the techniques of a master Japanese bonsai man , see Bonsai : Trees and Shrubs ? A Guide to the Methods of Kyuzo Murata by Lynn R. Perry ( New York : The Ronald Press Co. , 1964 ) . NURSERY STOCK NURSERY STOCK is often touted as an ideal cash crop for the homesteader or small landowner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you have : long rows in which to line out the stock so as to be able to weed , cultivate and root-prune with a tractor ; a tractor and the necessary attachments ; and a sure market for all your stock , or at least for entire rows at a time . Even if you have a field with long rows , a good deal of hand-weeding must be done , especially when the trees are small . Before this , a lot of weeding and growing time and space are required to develop the seedlings in the nursery beds to the point that they are ready to transplant to the open row . If a nursery or landscape company is willing to buy your entire stock and brings in their own crew to dig and move the trees , your marketing problem is solved . If you decide to sell your stock retail , you must dig , ball and burlap the trees and move them yourself . Digging trees is hard work . The time , labor and space required to grow good-quality nursery stock to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation for the homesteader . I26 OTHER PLANTS AS CASH CROPS If you are still contemplating nursery stock , let me further discourage you by directing you to glance over a publication of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Extension Service called Dollars and Decisions in Tree Planting ( PA 992 , 1972 ; available from U.S. Government Printing Office , Washington , D.C. 20402 ) . If you want to estimate the costs of tree planting , this publication tells you how to do it and even supplies hypothetical situations featuring little stories about Rex Rancher , Paul Pine , etc. , and worksheets for you to fill out . Although Rex and Paul may sound like escapees from your child 's bookshelf , the work sheets look very adult . After you have wrestled awhile with " cumulative maintenance costs " and " compound interest factors , " you will fall back on your common sense and decide that , in most cases , nursery stock is too much work for too little cash return . All the drawbacks to growing nursery stock apply to the raising of Christmas trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU HAVE A GREENHOUSE ? IF YOU LOVE PLANTS , IF YOU WANT TO GROW PARTICULAR varieties of flowers and vegetables from seed , if you want fresh flowers , herbs and lettuce year round , you should have a greenhouse . If you have a roadside stand , a shop of your own or a booth in a flea market , your greenhouse can provide an additional source of income . My first greenhouse , homemade from mostly scrap lumber and covered with a double layer of plastic , is nine feet wide and twelve feet long . Instead of concrete footings , I drove five-foot lengths of angle iron three feet into the ground at each corner of the house and bolted the one-inch-by-three-inch corner posts to the iron . Vertical studs four feet apart are one-by-threes , as are the horizontal rafters . Four center posts , the tallest in the frame , are four-by-fours . Benches are made of scrap boards on legs made of four-by-fours . The angle iron and lumber cost $48.85 . If you are new at buying lumber , check with your lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your specific need . For example , if you order one-by-three-inch lengths of lumber , you may be sold a grade suitable only for furring out masonry walls to be paneled . Such furring strips are apt to be knotty and will not bear the stress that wind exerts on the greenhouse frame . For the greenhouse frame , you need clear ( knotless ) strips . // Two electric heaters , one for either end of the house , cost $22 each . A twelve-inch exhaust fan cost $15 . Installation of electricity required running a cable from the house to the greenhouse and included two double outlets and one overhead light . Four outlets in so small a space may seem too many , but through the winter two outlets are needed for the heaters , one for the fan , and one for a soil cable to provide bottom heat for germinating eggplant and peppers and some flowers , and to hasten rooting geranium cuttings . The electrician 's bill was $92.35 . Plastic to cover the house cost $14 . A stapler and staples cost $16.43 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next ten years . Miscellaneous items such as a bundle of laths , roofing nails , a light bulb , etc. , I estimated at $5 . Altogether , the greenhouse cost $235.63 to build . A nine-by-twelve-foot prefabricated fiberglass greenhouse from a well-known firm , with benches but without heat , electricity , fan or foundation , would have cost $922 . If you can afford a good prefabricated glass or fiberglass house , and if you are certain your enthusiasm will not wane , buy one . The glass house does not need to be recovered yearly as the plastic house does , and is better-looking . The roof sections that open to ventilate the house are designed by people who know their business , and function ? automatically if you like ? more efficiently than the haphazard system in my house that consists of the exhaust fan , an open door and a close eye on the weather . Plans for homemade greenhouses are available from the U.S. Government Printing Office ( Washington , D.C. 20402 ) and appear in books on greenhouses ( see bibliography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants for the garden , but my cactus collection was the first tenant . Friends donated specimen begonias , succulents , etc . The greenhouse , completed in January 1971 , was crowded by the beginning of March . Through the winter of 1971 ? 72 I sold some plants at the antique market ? begonias , cacti , succulents and herbs . In 1972 , the greenhouse showed a profit of $542 ; in 1973 , $932 . Profits are based strictly on cash sales and do not // include any consideration of the income from vegetable plants , bedding plants , perennials or shrubs . In the fall of 1972 I added a six-by-nine-foot potting shed to the west end of the greenhouse . The shed was made completely of lumber and tin from a barn I had dismantled . If you contemplate building sheds , henhouses , etc. , keep an eye out for barns that are no longer used . Sometimes the owner will let you dismantle a barn and take it home . After six or seven queries , I found an agreeable owner who lent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck to haul away the beams that were too big for my pickup truck . I paneled a partition wall in the house with barn boards , built the henhouse , the potting shed and greenhouse benches with materials from the barn , and sold $200 worth of barn boards and strap hinges from the doors . I still have a good supply of lumber and roofing tin on hand . A potting shed is essential . You store there pots , tags , bone meal , potting soil , sand , leaf mold , tools , etc . On the potting-shcd bench you pot and repot plants and spot seedlings . I find that enthusiasm has waxed to the extent that I am about to build a second , larger greenhouse with flanking cold frames and an adjacent lathhouse . PROBLEMS AND DRAWBACKS LEST YOU ENVISION a cloudless future in greenhouse gardening , you should now consider the problems and drawbacks . Diseases and pests seem to be major problems in most greenhouses , according to books and articles . To date I have had no serious attacks . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cured have worked well for me and will for you . Keep the benches tidy . Do not allow weeds to grow beneath the benches . Do not leave dead plants or empty pots lying around the house . Ladybugs and spiders live year round in my greenhouse and from early spring to late fall there are many wasps . There are always several paper wasp nests in the potting shed and the // wasps fly in and out of the greenhouse at will . Even in winter a few crawl sleepily about and are especially fond of the hanging baskets . I believe the resident insects contribute to the lack of pests in the greenhouse . My insect guide tells me that almost all the wasps of America are important controls of agricultural pests . The ichneumon wasp is a parasite of the fall webworm ; braconid wasps destroy the pupae and larvae of moths , butterflies and beetles , and even parasitize aphids , one of the gardener 's biggest problems . So think twice before you aim the aerosol can at a wasp nest . Power failures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or controlled by an electric thermostat . The greenhouse cools very quickly and even a brief blackout in below-freezing weather can be fatal to many greenhouse plants . I plan to install a wood-burning stove in the potting shed of the new greenhouse . I hope to use the stove to heat the house with hot water from fall until early December and again from early March through mid-May . During the coldest months , I will use oil heat , but will have the wood stove to fall back on in case of power failure . The wood ashes from the stove will be good for the garden , and I will be able to sterilize soil in the oven of the stove instead of lugging it to the house oven as I do now . Overcrowding is a common problem . The greenhouse gardener is an instinctive propagator . A collection of 20 specimen cactus plants can overnight spawn 50 tiny cacti in two-inch pots when you pot up segments and offshoots . When you begin to propagate , you must plan for the future . You will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only drawback to greenhouse gardening is that it requires daily attention . If you are going to be away for more than a day , you must provide a caretaker who will not overwater , who will check the temperature and humidity from time to time , who will not smoke in the house , and who will remember to close the door . The pleasures ( and profits ) far outweigh the problems . To stand in your warm , humid greenhouse on a cold February day surrounded by flats of tomato and pepper seedlings , plump cacti , blooming begonias and scented geraniums is a soul-satisfy- // ing experience . Just when winter becomes unbearable , the greenhouse gives you a daily preview of spring complete with color , fragrance and atmosphere . The greenhouse imparts the same feeling of well-being and placid happiness as does the steamy shower stall . LOCATION YOUR GREENHOUSE should face south or southeast and should not be shaded on the east , west or south . It should be handy to your house . It should not be shaded , even on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . The greenhouse should be sheltered if possible from the prevailing wind . Ample space should be allowed in planning for the construction of cold frames on the southern or southeastern side of the house and for an adjacent or nearby lathhouse for the summering of many plants . Be sure to place the greenhouse , cold frames and lathhouse so that a truck or tractor can drive to the door to load and unload plants , soil and supplies . If your greenhouse is close to your house , both electricity and water can be run in from the house supply . My homemade greenhouse does not have a water supply . Thus far I have managed with a garden hose from an outside faucet of the house , except in freezing weather when I water by hand with water carried from the house . COLD FRAMES COLD FRAMES can be made of wood or concrete and covered with regular cold-frame sash or storm windows , either of which can usually be bought quite cheap at farm sales . Plans and dimensions are available from the U.S. Government Printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise plants from seed , you will need cold frames . A // flat of 200 tomato seedlings in February will need to be spaced out , or " spotted , " 30 or so to a flat in March . Thus one flat soon becomes six . By mid-March , the young plants can move into the cold frames to grow and harden off in the spring sun . The sash is raised on fine days and closed in late afternoon . If frost threatens , cover the closed frames with tarpaulins or old rugs . Large rugs with worn places or stains can be bought at farm auctions for as little as a dollar apiece . Water the cold frames early in the day so that humidity is comparatively low when the frames are closed . Water sparingly in rainy or cloudy weather . Low nighttime humidity discourages fungi and the breeding of pests . THE LATHHOUSE THE LATHHOUSE is useful for summering house plants . My lathhouse is eight feet high , twelve feet long and eight feet wide . It has two beds three feet wide on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails , the materials cost nothing . The upright posts are four- to five-inch-thick swamp maple poles from the woods ; the laths are two- to four-inch-wide log trimmings from a nearby sawmill which were free for the taking , as was any quantity I wanted of well-rotted sawdust which I used to mulch the beds . The side and overhead laths are spaced four inches apart . The new lathhouse will have a greentinted fiberglass roof . Since the lathhouse has to be watered regularly , the occasional rainwater seems to be of little use . Often the summer storm is so heavy that the plants become sodden and the leaves mud-splashed . Begonias , bromeliads , most succulents , neomaricas , etc. thrive in the lathhouse . It is a pleasant place to work in summer so I have a table and a supply of pots and soil there . Many begonia cuttings , bromeliad pups and neomarica divisions are potted up in the lathhouse in early summer , taken to market in early fall , and so never require expensive greenhouse space . X33 HOMESTEADING THE GREENHOUSE YEAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenhouse year but the homestead year altogether . For most of my life the year began in September with the opening of school . For purposes of dating letters and checks , one must remember the calendar year . As a bookkeeper in graduate school , I had to keep in mind the fiscal year which began July 1 . We all keep in mind the income tax year which officially ends December 31 , but does n't really end until midnight of the following April 15 . To all these ways of noting the passing of time , you , as a country dweller , will add the growing year which begins in the greenhouse or on your windowsill in the short days of winter . Through February , March and part of April , the greenhouse produces vegetable plants and bedding flowers . Houseplants move to the shelves beneath the benches or to the floor . Some , especially large stock plants , may have to move into the house as seedling flats proliferate . By mid-March , tomatoes , cabbage and marigolds can move into the cold frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly fill all available bench space . On April the stock plants of scented geraniums and of most cactus can move outdoors although they may have to be covered on one or two frosty nights . Geranium and begonia cuttings , taken in midMarch and rooting over the soil-heating cable recently vacated by the eggplants and peppers , are now ready to pot and to move from the shelf onto the bench and into full sunlight . By May 1 , eggplant and peppers can move into the cold frame ; begonias , ivies and houseplants go to the lathhouse . The succulents and cacti for sale remain in the now lightly shaded greenhouse ( old matchstick blinds nailed to the rafters ) where they are safe from rabbits , rain splash and sun scald . About now the heaters are cleaned and put away . Through June , July and August the floor of the greenhouse under the benches is used to propagate hydrangea cuttings , ivy , Tradescantia ( spiderwort ) , spider plants , etc . Tiny juniper trees are brought in from the woods and rest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplanting . Then they // will move into the lathhouse where they will be trimmed and root-pruned for two years , when they will be offered for sale to bonsai enthusiasts . On the shelves are the Christmas and orchid cactus and the smaller bromeliads such as Cryptanthus . On top of the benches perennial seeds are sown in covered flats and carefully watered and watched . Scented geraniums and Lady ' Washington types that are about to bloom and are ready for sale are often kept on the greenhouse bench so they can not be ruined at the last moment by a dashing rain . About mid-June I strip off the plastic sides of the greenhouse . This allows a free flow of air and prevents the house from overheating . The plastic roof with its matchstick shades provides protection from rain and sun . In late September or early October , it is time to recover the plastic house . I try to do this as late as possible because , once covered , the house is difficult to keep cool on hot fall days . The shades and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped off and the new plastic put on , preferably on a windless day . My nine-by-twelve-foot greenhouse requires a sheet of plastic 24 feet by 14 feet to cover it . Such a large expanse is difficult to control if there is so much as a slight breeze blowing . The heaters come out of storage and the stock plants move indoors from beds and lathhouse . Young perennials and hydrangeas move into the now uncovered cold frame where they will spend the winter under a straw mulch . November through January I propagate houseplants to maintain a supply for sale . I try to keep my holdings to a minimum so there will be sufficient bench space for the seedling flats in early February . There is a stock plant for each of most of these varieties in addition to the plants of various sizes being grown for sale . Besides the sale stock , the greenhouse shelters 12 specimen cacti that arc my own collection and so far have not produced little ones or segments that I can root and sell . Through the winter months several pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant each of oregano , marjoram and rosemary move into the greenhouse for the winter ? both to survive and to provide fresh herbs for the kitchen . From October to March the greenhouse maintains a rather constant population of 600 plants , about 55o of which are being grown for sale . To keep a steady supply of plants for sale on hand and still provide bench space for the spring seedling flats requires a nice sense of timing , a feeling for what sells best when , and a certain amount of juggling . Approximately 200 bromeliad seedlings and pups are always coming along ? perhaps 50 seedlings at a time in a pint cottage-cheese container and 20 pups in three-inch pots . I keep the greatest number in the smallest space as long as possible . For example , I keep six Cryptanthus plants ready for sale of each species I offer . I let the pups remain on the parent plant as // long as I can , if possible , until I need to pot one up to replace one that has been sold . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 50 succulents at a time . Small pieces of Kalanchoe , orchid cactus , Haworthia , Kleinia , etc. are simply stuck in the flat where they root and prosper until needed . You soon learn which plants are most popular with your customers and the seasons of their greatest popularity . I have learned in three years that cacti and succulents sell well all year long in both the nearby farmers ' market and in Philadelphia . Bromeliads do not sell at all well at the farmers ' market but do well in Philadelphia in fall and winter . Scented geraniums generally sell best at the farmers ' market in spring and early summer , but peppermint geranium sells very well all winter long in the city . Customer preferences are no doubt regional in your area , too . And you will have to learn them for yourself and work out your own greenhouse schedule . Think about your market and listen to your customers . Apartment dwellers are windowsill gardeners , terrarium makers and hanging basket buffs . The suburban and country dweller may be all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , even indoors , has room for larger plants than the city dweller . When a rash of propagating breaks out or when the spring seedling flats move onto the benches , some juggling is inevitable . I often move the sun-loving cacti and succulents to the shelf beneath the bench for a week or two at a time when I need bench space . Some bromeliads , succulents , begonias and ivies have to move from the bench to the shelf to the floor . Luckily , some plants such as orchid cactus , Tradescantia ( wandering Jew ) and Swedish ivy prefer the shelf or floor . If you plan to grow shade-loving plants , and you should , you will find a shelf beneath the benches a great asset . The prefabricated greenhouse makers provide benches 30 inches high . My homemade benches are 39 inches high . The shelves beneath the benches are i6 inches above the floor so that I have headroom for good-sized plants on both the shelves and floor . The higher benches are also easier to work on since they // do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back breaker for anyone of average height , and provides less growing space . Consider economy ( because greenhouse space is expensive to heat and should be used to the greatest extent possible ) and your back when you decide on the height of your benches . Besides utilizing the space beneath the benches , you can use the space above them for hanging baskets . I now keep 24 hanging baskets suspended from the rafters of the greenhouse . My eight-inch plastic baskets are filled with three varieties of wandering Jew , Swedish ivy , three varieties of spider plant , two kinds of ivy , hare's-foot ferns and asparagus ferns . In 1972 , receipts from hanging baskets totaled $187 for 33 baskets sold . In 1973 I sold 64 baskets and receipts totaled $303 . If you want to make money with your greenhouse , offer for sale only healthy , well-grown plants attractively potted and labeled . Know the common and Latin names of your plants . Most of your customers will want to know only the common names , but a sprinkling of more scientifically-minded plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer who buys a Stapelia nobilis one week and later recalls that you have two other species will often return for S. variegata and S. Leendertziae . Unless all three varieties are in bloom , or the plants are labeled , the untrained eye of the average customer will not detect a difference among the species . Grow for sale plants that are not commonly sold in your area . Many of my customers say they have never seen or heard of scented geraniums , Stapelia , rosary vine , etc . I encourage them to sample the scent of the various geraniums and show them a specimen Stapelia in bloom so they will know what to expect from the small plant they buy from me . Many people will buy a particular plant simply because no one else they know has one ? a motive certainly not peculiar to the plant business . Balance your list with fast-growing favorites . Tradescantia , Zebrina and Setcreasea , different types of spiderwort ( and all commonly known as wandering Jew ) , root easily , grow quickly and sell well . Green- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prolific bloomers . Well-grown , // bushy plants sell all year long to apartment dwellers and suburban gardeners alike . When you take your plants to market be sure to take along a supply of extra labels and a waterproof marker , a small watering can , a coffee can full of extra potting soil in case of spills , and a collection of small cartons to pack plants in since bags are not suitable containers for many plants . Ask friends and neighbors to collect and save small cartons for you . Take along a good measure of self-control . There are always browsers who pinch leaves , and usually at least one plant is broken , dropped , uprooted or defoliated every market day . There is always the elderly lady who sniffs at your prices and says that in her day rose geraniums sold for 10 cents apiece . There is the lady who surveys your display at length and announces that she has every single plant you have and that hers are bigger and better and have more flowers . Do not let slip that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . Even though it is the end of a long and trying day , do not mutter , " So what . " Smile and tell her you would love to see her collection . You will make her feel good and she may return one day to buy one of your new offerings . PLANTING HANGING BASKETS WE WILL here consider in some detail the planting of hanging baskets . This is evidently a poorly understood procedure since one sees so many skimpy , anemic and bedraggledlooking baskets offered at high prices in markets , florist shops and plant centers . Well-grown , well-filled baskets of Tradescantia , Setcreasea , ivies and asparagus ferns sell very well for me at the antique market and fairly well at slightly lower prices at the nearby farmers ' market . Most of my baskets are filled with fastgrowing plants and sell for $7.5o each . The same size ( eightinch ) baskets of Stapelia and hare's-foot fern sell from $ro to $30 , depending on the age and size of the plant . My aim is to sell three baskets a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least $1100 from baskets alone . With additional growing space in the new greenhouse and a panel truck to transport plants to market , this goal seems easily attainable . At present , with space for only 24 baskets in the small greenhouse , I am barely able to keep five ready for sale at all times . The new house will have room for 72 baskets and should enable me to keep several on hand of every type I offer , in addition to the ones that are newly planted and growing into a saleable state . If you plan to grow baskets for sale , buy the baskets wholesale . Seed catalogs and garden centers sell for up to $2.50 each exactly the same basket I buy , by the case , at a little less than 6o cents apiece . Pick the color of your baskets with care . Green seems to be the one color that is available in all sizes and shapes of pots . However , green is the one color that contrasts poorly with most plants . A few plants , like the purple-leaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most green-leaved plants look better in white or terra-cotta baskets . Begin a hanging basket by filling the well with pieces of broken pots . Do this completely so that when the basket is filled , soil will not wash into the saucer when the basket is watered . A muddy saucer detracts from the attractiveness of the basket . Once dirt lodges in the saucer it is difficult and tedious to remove , so use an ounce of prevention and fill the well with crockery to well above the drainage holes . Use lots of humus in the potting mixture for baskets . Good , sifted garden soil mixed half and half with coarsely sifted leaf mold produces a nice loose mixture that lets the plants establish themselves quickly and contains enough nutrients to keep the plants growing well for quite a while . Fill the basket to about an inch below the rim with damp potting soil . Make planting holes with a dibber or your fingers and plant the rooted cuttings . Be lavish with the plants to get a full basket quickly . I plant an eight-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Setcreasea ? five or six around the rim and the rest across the top . Spider plants , too , are best grown rather crowded . Baskets of fast-growing Tradescantia will be ready for sale three weeks after planting . The // spider plants , ivies and Swedish ivy need a longer growing period . From planting time to selling time , keep the baskets well watered . Turn them periodically so that all plants have an equal amount of sunlight and make more or less equal growth . If one or two shoots far outgrow the others , pinch them back close to the ring of the basket so they will branch and put their extra vigor into three or four shoots instead of one long straggler . Small-leaved ivies make attractive baskets . I put a small ball made of old chicken wire , about the size of a baseball , or a sausage-shaped roll of hardware cloth , on the soil of the basket and train some of the ivy over it . The mound of ivy makes a point for the trailing strands to seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket . CUTTINGS IF YOU ARE going to propagate plants for sale from stock plants , you will be making cuttings . This is a simple operation requiring only a sharp knife and a rooting compound . Cut a tip from a plant such as patience ( Impatiens ) or begonia , dip the cut tip in the rooting compound , and plant in a shallow tray firmly packed with moist sand or vermiculite or a mixture of the two . Keep the cuttings out of direct sunlight for a couple of days until they spruce up and give signs of growing . A tip cutting should be just that . Cut the plant tip so that you have an inch of stem to go into the rooting mixture . Short cuttings result in bushy plants . A short distance from the rooting tip to the leaves means less distance for food and water to travel , which makes it easier for the plant to establish itself . A soil-heating cable is a great aid in rooting many cuttings . Mine is 12 feet long and heats a four-square-foot area at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in a flat on the bench , cover it with sand and root cuttings directly in the sand or put the trays full of cuttings on the sand . Detailed , illustrated instructions on making cuttings can be // found in books on houseplants , propagation and greenhouses . In propagating plants for sale I have found that the chief problem is scheduling so that there are always cuttings in various stages of development . If your greenhouse is so well organized that you can keep like plants together , you can easily see which plants need new cuttings . However , if your house is crowded and you practice a certain amount of juggling to make bench space , you can lose track of which plants are in which stage of development . The easiest way to keep your stock of plants for sale complete is to keep a list of what you sell on market days and the next day replace those plants . If you use all your rooted cuttings of a particular species for hanging baskets , make a small tray of new cuttings at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to market , the new cuttings are ready to be planted . It is essential not to put off until next week what you should do today . You can put off refinishing a table indefinitely and do it the day before the antique show opens , but plants need time to reach a saleable stage . CACTI AND SUCCULENTS FOR SALE MOST GROWERS I have talked to buy their cacti and succulents from wholesale dealers . On a small scale I have found that it is easier and cheaper to grow my own from stock plants . Growing your own also eliminates the worry and uncertainties of depending on the mail and the chance that the new plants will bring insects and diseases into your greenhouse . Barrel , rabbit ears , yellow stars , peanut and rattail-type cacti are easily propagated by offsets . I pot up the little plants in good potting soil ( half topsoil , one-quarter sifted leaf mold , one-quarter sand , and a handful of bone meal to a bucketful ) to about half an inch from the top of the pot . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer of fine pure sand which shows off the plant well and is , after all , traditional . Cacti for sale are watered frequently in sunny weather . They grow well and rapidly , for cactus , and sell well . i 4 z THE GREENHOUSE I propagate , by offsets or cuttings , 16 species of succulents for sale ? most of them as small plants in two-and-one-halfor three-inch pots . Succulents , though easy to grow , are a little more demanding than the cacti in that some require more or less water , or sun , than others . Cacti and succulents are fascinating and profitable to grow . Should you decide to raise them as a cash crop , you should read at least one of the several good books listed in the bibliography . SUPPLIES AND TOOLS FOR THE GREENHOUSE ASIDE FROM POTS and watering cans there are a number of tools and materials you should keep on hand in the potting shed . Ingredients for potting mixtures : Keep on hand a supply of sifted topsoil , leaf mold , vermiculite or perlite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller bins in the potting shed . Keep your bins filled as well as you can so that come rain or snow or frozen ground , the greenhouse work can go on . When guests turn up on fine fall weekends to enjoy the autumn foliage and so on , take advantage of their presence by having them fill the bins with sifted earth and leaf mold . Rooting compound , to promote rapid rooting of your cuttings , is usually bought in small amounts , often in envelopes . Put the envelope in a lidded , labeled jar directly it arrives in the potting shed . If you neglect to do this , the opened envelope will one day be knocked to the floor , or it will get wet and be ruined . If guests are allowed to make cuttings , impress on them that the rooting powder is to be returned to its jar and the lid screwed on as soon as the last cutting has been made and before the watering can is used . Even with these precautions and warnings , you will be wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , against the Sunday morning that you reach for the jar and find it empty . Keep a knife and a pair of scissors in the potting shed . // Make it clear that they are never to be removed ? even for a moment . Keep a supply of pipe cleaners on hand to clean spray heads and to clear out the necks of watering can spouts . Sooner or later a leaf or a bug will fall into the can and lodge in the neck . If you have watering cans with very long necks , keep a length of stiff wire or a rifle cleaning rod . The cleaning rod is excellent because a patch of cloth can be put in the slit at the end of the rod and does a good job of cleaning . Some of the tubes on long-necked cans are too small for a rod , and you will have to use stiff wire . The best practice is to keep watering cans as clean as possible and not let them sit about with water in them for long periods so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potting shed all broken clay pots . Break them into small pieces so they can be stored in a bucket or flat and are ready to use for drainage in the bottoms of pots . Tell friends , neighbors and customers to save broken pots for you . Even so , once you begin to sell plants , the drainage material will always be in short supply . Keep a stiff-bristled brush at hand to tidy up the potting shed bench as you work . Keeping the working surface clean makes the work pleasanter and makes it easier to keep pots clean and attractive . The potting shed should have its own dustpan to gather up the leaves and potting soil that accumulate on the floor . Empty the dustpan into a compost heap or an outdoor bed , not onto the ground just outside the door where it will only create luxuriant weeds . If you are going to have a small greenhouse just for fun , you can devote a part of your bench space to growing a winter supply of lettuce , cucumbers and tomatoes . Stokes Seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomatoes . You can have a cold-weather supply of cut flowers ranging from simple calendulas to long-stemmed carnations . A small greenhouse often first houses a hodgepodge collection of houseplants and gifts from friends . But as time goes on the greenhouse gardener finds his interests broaden and deepen . Ile can not grow all the varieties he would like to grow ? too many // different greenhouse climates would be required . So he often specializes in one type of plant or one genus . If you have a greenhouse , you will one day realize that you have become a collector ? whether of orchids , bromeliads or carnivorous plants . In a small greenhouse you can raise as many perennials as you can plant and care for , spring bedding plants , herbs and vegetables . You can propagate deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs from seeds or cuttings . The greenhouse can benefit the entire domestic establishment ? providing flowers and permanent plants for the grounds , vegetable and herb plants for the kitchen garden , and flowers and plants to brighten the house . As your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , you will want to learn specific soil , light and moisture requirements , when a certain species should bloom , when it is best to propagate , and so on . You will want to learn a lot fast . A crash program is easy and fun . Subscribe to one gardening magazine at a time . Pick one , like Horticulture , that has a regular monthly column on the small greenhouse . Read it thoroughly ? even the articles that do n't much interest you . You will learn vocabulary and terms that will come in handy as time goes by . If a number of magazines arrive regularly , the tendency is to flip through all of them and read very little . In your garden magazine you will see advertisements from mail-order greenhouse growers . Send away for the catalogs that interest you ? especially the illustrated ones that you usually have to pay for . The catalogs of specialized growers will let you glimpse another world where there are people whose lives revolve around rex begonias or the search for a pure white marigold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? especially from the pictures which will train your eye to see varietal differences and will show you how top-quality , wellgrown plants should look . Join the nearest library and go through the garden books . Buy only those books for which you will have a continuing need . // Attend flower shows whenever you can ? you will come away with new interests and new ideas not only for the greenhouse but for landscaping , outdoor gardens and flower arranging as well . Visit the greenhouses of specialized growers . You will probably buy a few plants and learn quite a bit about greenhouse management . If you are so fortunate as to be within traveling distance of a botanical garden , visit the greenhouses , conservatories and gardens . I am within an easy one-hour drive of Longwood Gardens in Chester County , Pennsylvania , and go there three or four times a year . The gardeners and staff are friendly , helpful and full of information about cultural methods and sources of rare plants . When you have succumbed to a special interest , you may want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant group . Such societies usually publish a journal , may hold conventions , give awards and grants , etc . Local chapters may pool funds to import rare species or to buy seed which all members share . Beware of subscribing to too many publications , buying too many books or joining too many clubs . Remember that the greenhouse represents only one facet of country living . You may also be interested in fruit and nut trees , fancy poultry , purebred livestock and cabinet-making ? all of which have a full complement of journals , books and clubs . X46 Hens and Eggs HENS PRODUCING EGGS , MEAT AND MANURE ARE ESSENTIAL to the homestead economy . Your egg basket is always full , and home-grown fresh eggs are vastly superior to supermarket eggs produced under artificial conditions and often held in storage . Eggs can also be a cash crop . Try a small flock the first year . Nine hens should supply you with at least three dozen eggs a week . By the end of your first year you will know a good deal about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add eggs to your list of income-producing activities . I began with a friend 's pet rooster who needed a home in the country . I bought some hens to keep him company , housed them in a makeshift shelter in the yard , and soon was enjoying the luxury of fresh eggs . The flock grew and people began to ask if I had eggs for sale . Now I have a flock of 48 hens , mostly black Jersey Giants , all of which lay brown eggs . I also have two roosters . The big white rooster , Daddy Warbucks , will sire next year 's flock . The other , a Silver Spangled Hamburg called the Pirate , was a " free , fancy chick bonus " that arrived with my chick order . He escaped the hatchet when the other cockerels were killed because he is too beautiful to kill . He will continue to strut around and eat until he dies of old age and so cut into the profits of the flock . You will do well to avoid this softness of the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-producers among your livestock . // Laying hens are profitable for me . I calculated the total profit on 48 laying hens at $590 a year , but prices are rising constantly . I have regular customers for all the eggs I can produce . When I increase the size of the flock , I have a market at the antique market in Philadelphia where I have a booth every Sunday from September until May and at the farmers ' market from May to September . The eggs are large to extra large , brown , often double yolked , and of excellent quality . The hens run with a rooster and range over fenced fields and woods in summer , through the gardens and orchard in fall and winter . I advise my customers that my hens are never fed medicated feeds , thirst- or appetiteboosters or hormones , and that the eggs may be fertile . My fixed price is 85 cents a dozen . Many people first buy the extra-large eggs for the novelty of serving two fried eggs with four yolks . They often become regular customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whites that stand up well in the frying pan , and the good flavor . I am so happy with my hen venture that I am expanding the flock to 150 hens . I do not intend to go beyond that number because I can not afford the time to care for more without hiring outside help . From 48 laying hens I count on 16 dozen eggs a week for sale . I expect each hen to lay four eggs a week minimum . Since quite a few hens lay more often , I always have a good supply of eggs for the house . At 85 cents a dozen , egg sales produce at least $13.6o a week , or at least $598 a year . ( I count only on 44 weeks in the egg-producing year since hens molt and stop laying in late summer . If all goes well and I set my hens at the right time in spring , the new flock will be beginning to lay just as the mature hens begin to molt . But to be on the safe side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . ) My visitors and I use about three dozen eggs a week . I like omelets , custards and deviled eggs as well as egg salad and eggs for breakfast . Conservatively , I estimate the value of the eggs // for the house at $2 a week for the entire year since I can store enough eggs to get through the molting period . All year long I have a good supply of stewing chicken . In winter I make chicken noodle soup that is a meal in itself , chicken potpie and chicken with dumplings , all dishes that are perfect on cold , raw days . In summer when I have lots of company , I have lots of chicken salad ? in sandwiches , stuffed in hollowed-out tomatoes , heaped on lettuce beds , for chickenand-watercress sandwiches , and in club sandwiches . I use about 20 stewing chickens a year . At current supermarket prices for stewing chicken I am very safe in assessing my five-to-sevenpound stewers at $2 each . Beginning in mid-July I begin to remove the cockerels from the spring hatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three pounds and are excellent fried , broiled or barbecued . Through August , September and October I devour about 20 fryers . City visitors love them because they have so much more flavor than supermarket birds . I cut up five or so for the freezer and often send some home with friends . I assess the fryers at $1 apiece ? $25 worth a year for my household . I should caponize some of the cockerels for Thanksgiving and Christmas , but so far I have not attempted the operation . My 1925 poultry book tells me that the average hen produces 50 pounds of manure a year . I assume that is still true : My poultry book says to estimate the value of the manure at 25 cents a hen . Fertilizer prices have risen considerably since 1925 . Plain old 5 ? 10 ? 5 fertilizer at the garden center will cost me at least 5 cents a pound and does nothing to benefit the soil . So I conservatively estimate my rich , soil-building manure at 5 cents a pound or $75 a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish all year long , and their garbage disposal function ( they eat lettuce trimmings , beet tops , carrots , tomatoes past their prime , etc. ) are not considered in the receipt column but should be mentioned . 149 FEED IS THE MOST expensive item . Feed bills are highest from mid-October to mid-April . From April to October there is plenty of forage and trimmings from the garden available . During cold weather , feed for 48 hens and two roosters averages $5.55 a week if all feed must be bought . From April to October the bill at the feed store is at least one-third less ( about $3 a week ) because for most of this period feed is cheaper and the hens are eating less bought feed . The hens have laying mash before them all the time , get morning and evening rations of scratch ( a mixture of whole and cracked grains ) , have extra rations of cracked corn in cold weather , and receive an occasional ration of whole oats . Oyster shell is kept in a wall feeder . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November until March I light the henhouse from about 3 A.M. until daylight . The 6o-watt bulb burns , at most , 25 hours a week . The electric company tells me that even with the heating element under the waterer thrown in , the cost of electricity could not be more than 10 cents a week . So we estimate the electric bill for the year at $2 . The henhouse cost $125 to build . Nesting boxes , feeders , waterers , feed hoppers , storage bins and egg baskets cost approximately $loo . Wire fence for the runs cost $25 . The total cost of house and equipment is $245 . I expect it all to last for ten years so I estimate depreciation at $24 a year . 150 Subtracting $252 from $842 income leaves me with a net profit of $590 . Of course , I have not figured in the property tax on the land occupied by the henhouse or the cost of flypaper and the kerosene to disinfect the roosting poles . But then I did n't count on any egg sales for August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden . However , this rough estimate is exact enough to convince me that a laying flock is worthwhile . This is the kind of account of a small flock that I looked for in vain when I first thought of keeping hens . I hope it is what you are looking for . How TO GET STARTED ALL THE BOOKS will tell you the advantages and disadvantages of starting either with day-old chicks or ready-tolay pullets . I believe day-old chicks are best ? and a lot more fun . You learn quite a bit about chickens when you bring up a flock of day olds . If there are no suppliers of day-old chicks in your locale ? or if you can not find the breed you want ? write to request the catalog of the McMurray Hatchery , Webster City , Iowa 50595 . The McMurray catalog is like a seed catalog in that you must exercise great strength of will to steer clear of the exotic and stick to the sensible . If you are not careful you will be ordering long-tailed Yokohamas and Araucanas instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits your needs . Get a book on poultry . Your poultry book should have plans for small henhouses , runs , details on feeding , caponizing , 1 5 1 HOMESTEADING debeaking , etc . All poultry books also have detailed and depressing descriptions of various diseases that poultry may contract . Do not linger overlong on this chapter . If you buy healthy chicks , feed them properly , give them fresh air and water and adequate shelter , and maintain good housekeeping standards , you are not likely to have many problems . I have listed in the bibliography the poultry books I have come across . I do not describe the poultry handbooks put out by feed companies since I regard them as commercials . The ones I have promote medicated feed and hint the miracles of growth and production the chemical industry has put in each sack of chicken feed . But the ominous words " discontinue feeding five days before used for human consumption " alarm me . I prefer , and obviously my customers prefer , eggs from hens producing at their own rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirst and hunger . Follow the feeding instructions in your poultry book ? at least in the beginning . Later , especially when your hens begin to lay , you may notice that they are not eating up all their mash or that they are not laying as frequently as they should . Experiment with their feed . Try giving them a wet mash for a couple of clays ( simply mix enough water with the dry mash to make a damp , crumbly mixture ) . Try giving them more or less scratch , or devote one feed hopper to oats and see how they take to that . The figures given in the consideration of expenses of a flock were based on the idea that all feed was to be purchased . If you can grow some of your own feed , you will of course cut your feed costs . If you have only so much tillable land , you must consider whether there is more profit in growing poultry feed or some other cash crop . If you decide to grow some feed , consider mangel beets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just plain mangels , these beets are oversized , coarse textured and easy to grow and store . They provide fresh food in winter when forage disappears . Another source of fresh feed for winter is some of the leftovers from the vegetable garden . Store any watermelons left on the vine on beds of straw in the cold house // or a cool cellar . In the middle of December they may be more appealing to you than they were in September . Take the heart of the melon for use in your kitchen and give the rest to the hens ? in large pieces . Grow your own corn if you can . Set your grinder loosely so that when you run the corn through , it is merely cracked . Freshly cracked corn , good oats and sunflower seeds mixed together make good scratch . Use the cornstalks to bank the windward side of your chicken runs . If they have a sheltered , sunny spot , your hens will spend more time outside in winter and in consequence will be healthier and less prone to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In spring , shred the cornstalks and use them for mulch , or compost them with manure to make a strawy , rich top dressing . I planted a mulberry tree in each run to provide shade and berries . Hens also love the leaves of the mulberry tree . My trees tended to branch close to the ground when they were small . If you plant trees in the runs , prune low-growing branches or the hens will use them as a ladder to get high enough up in the tree to sail over the fence . I also plant kudzu vine just outside the runs . The hens will eat the leaves as they come into the run but can not kill the plant itself . By using the runs alternately , the kudzu , which grows rapidly , has a chance to send new runners well into the empty run . Through spring , summer and fall , the hens will eat the culls and leftovers of orchard and vegetable garden . Always give them the rind of cantaloupe and watermelon when it leaves your table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit . I throw most of the clippings from the kitchen herb garden into the hen runs . They seem especially fond of lemon balm . Since this perennial herb stays green in a sheltered spot through early winter , I have a clump growing in the run , fenced so that hens ca n't strip the entire plant and kill it . Through the winter let the hens forage through the vegetable gardens , grape vines and the orchard . They grub out sleeping cutworms and borers , eat weed seeds and drop a little manure as they go . Do not allow them to roam in your rock // garden , herb garden or perennial beds . They will dislodge plants and throw dirt into the paths . HEN HOUSEKEEPING MY POULTRY BOOK recommends that roosts be built above manure pits ? the pits to be cleaned out twice a year . For the small flock ( up to 150 birds ) I do not believe that manure pits are a good idea . My henhouse is about loo paces from my kitchen door , making it easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer removable dropping boards beneath the roosts . I am afraid that with manure pits the smell from the henhouse would be objectionable . Using frequently cleaned dropping boards and good housekeeping practices , I have a sweet-smelling henhouse . Be sure to make your dropping boards wide enough . They should extend at least eight inches beyond the roosting pole itself . If you plan to have large breeds such as Rocks or jersey Giants , make your boards several inches wider than the poultry book advises . Be sure to put a width of wire netting beneath the roosts so that the birds can not stand on the boards . Every morning , clean the edges of the dropping boards . Keep an old bucket and a wide-bladed metal spatula in the henhouse for this purpose . Once a week , clean the entire surface of the boards . Sprinkle the boards lightly with ground limestone . Once a month wash the boards , sponge them with a good household disinfectant , and let them dry in the sun . Allow five minutes every morning to fill feed hoppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run and let the hens out . That is the time required for a flock of 48 hens , provided that you move rapidly and that the tools and containers you need are at hand . Do not borrow henhouse items to use elsewhere or you will expend time and effort retrieving them from garden , greenhouse or barn . From fall to the end of winter you can put the manure on vegetable and annual flower beds where time and the weather will mellow it . From spring to fall , compost the droppings . I try 154 II HENS AND EGGS to make the summer compost heaps near the parts of the garden where the heavy feeding plants will grow next year so the rotted manure will be handy for side dressing of plants through the summer . Wash the windows in the henhouse from time to time so as to let in as much light as possible . Knock cobwebs down and dust-brush smooth surfaces . Keep your waterer clean and full of fresh water . Litter tends to pack down , so occasionally turn it over with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sugar has been extracted . This is sold in my area in bales under the trade name of Staz Dry . I put down new litter in June when the April-hatched chicks are beginning to stray from the hens . The old litter goes from the henhouse straight to the vegetable garden to mulch whatever needs it most ? in my garden , usually eggplant . Paint the roosting poles with kerosene every once in a while in case any bugs or their eggs are lurking there . Although the poultry book advises whitewashing the henhouse interior several times a year , I only do it once , in spring , just before the new litter is put down . If lice ever become a problem , I shall have to whitewash more often . Although so far I 've had no need to fumigate the henhouse , I keep in mind that this can be accomplished by burning flour of sulphur in the tightly closed henhouse . In 1925 this item was available , according to my poultry manual , in any drugstore and is also recommended in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumigating agent is given the pleasanter name of " flowers of sulphur . " My book also tells me to clean out the nest when a hen and her brood leave it and to mix powdered tobacco leaves with the new straw in the box . I never have tobacco leaves in any form on hand so I put pennyroyal or hyssop , strewing-herbs of good repute , in the boxes . Here , in mostly sandy south Jersey , my hens have no trouble making dust baths for themselves . If the soil in your runs is hard , you should provide your hens with dust baths of sand to which may be added a handful of slaked lime and sifted wood ash from the fireplace . 155 In the feed-storing part of your henhouse you should have a sturdy table to put things on and a shelf above the table for the same purpose . Hang a pair of scissors on the wall above the table for opening feed bags . Find a place for egg baskets , a brush for applying kerosene to the roosts , a pitchfork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedroom . If you keep all feed in the henhouse in lidded metal containers , do not spill feed , and keep mousetraps set , you should have little trouble with mice . Add a cat to the precautions and you cut the problem to almost zero . If you have children or pets , you will do your peace of mind a good turn by avoiding spring traps and poison rodent baits altogether . The " catchthem-alive " traps are well made , humane and safe . I keep one in the henhouse feedroom and one beneath the house . Short of frequent use of the high-power insecticides , there does n't seem to be much one can do to eliminate flies . I keep X56 HENS AND EGGS their numbers down by cleanliness mainly . I also hang flypaper from the ceiling rafters and put fly cakes in saucers in the feedroom . I prefer a few flies to the use of deadly chemicals . The hens do n't seem to mind them and now I find that I do n't either . VOCABULARY Brooder : In the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a large metal dome . A brooder hangs over young chicks to provide warmth in the absence of a mother hen . Broody : Describes a hen who sits in the nesting box all day but does not lay . Hens can go broody anytime . They can be brought out of broodiness by putting them in a slatted box with feed and water within reach just outside the cage . Three days is considered sufficient time in confinement to cure broodiness . Grit : Hard , sharp , stone particles that the hen needs in her // gizzard to grind food . Grit serves as teeth to a hen and is therefore essential . If you think that not enough natural grit is available to your hens , buy some at the poultry supply store and keep it before the hens all the time in a wall feeder . Shell or Oyster Shell : Essential to laying hens as it supplies calcium for making strong eggshells . Buy oyster shell or limestone grit at the poultry supply house and keep it before the hens at all times . Mash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can make a laying mash yourself , but it is easier to buy it . If you are at all interested in natural foods or alarmed by the high content of chemicals in our food , be sure that your supplier sells you mash that is pure ? that is , it does not contain hormones , antibiotics or such chemicals as strychnine or arsenate of lead . Scratch : Coarsely cracked and whole-grain mixture . Hens often prefer it to mash and should eat a balance of the two types of feed . Scatter scratch in the runs and on top of the litter in the house . The hens will get exercise scratching through the litter for the grain and will also help to keep the litter turned , making less work for you . Molt : A four-to-six-week period of non-laying during which hens also shed some of their feathers and look rather bedraggled . My hens have molted traditionally in late September ? early October . Pullet : Young hen ; after she molts she becomes an old hen . Cockerel : Young male bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other signs of his masculinity , he becomes a rooster. 1 58 Winter Income INTER IS THE MOST LEISURELY TIME . THE GARDENS have been put to bed and the crops harvested . The pantry and woodbox are full and the fireplace is inviting . It is the time to write letters , read good books and mull over the seed catalogs . You need only to gather eggs , tend the greenhouse and pay the bills . Through late fall and winter I sell firewood and kindling , antiques , dried arrangement material , homemade preserves and eggs . The actual work was mostly done from spring to fall . Winter is the time to sell . FIREWOOD IF YOU HAVE a truck , a chain saw , a sledgehammer and some wedges , and if you are in reasonably good health , you might consider the firewood business . You must first consider if you have a supply of wood . I have 22 acres of woodland from which an overabundance of wild cherry trees needs removing . I cut down dead and diseased trees from fall to spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen . This wood , of whatever species , supplies most of the wood for my own fireplace . When the first spring days arrive , usually in March , I fell cherry trees a couple of hours a day , a couple of // days a week . I try to keep this up through the end of June . I let the trees lie where they fall until the side branches have been trimmed . This chore is a very good one for guests . Give guests a bow saw and a pair of heavy-duty loppers and send them out to trim for an hour or so before breakfast . Do not give inexperienced guests hatchets , axes or machetes . Branch ends , leaves and twigs are piled up to await shredding and conversion to mulch . The trimmed logs are pulled by the tractor to the firewood storage racks and stacked on their ends , six or seven to a group in teepee fashion to be sawed , as time permits , into fireplace lengths . I find this method best because the hard work is spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to spend one entire day cutting wood , you may need three days to recover . My object here is to sell 20 cords of wood a season at $50 a cord . I also sell about 40 bundles of kindling a season at $i a bundle . I expect a $zoo chain saw to last five years , so depreciation on the chain saw is $40 a year . Fuel and repairs average $35 a year . My net profit from the firewood business is $965 . I also gain a good deal of material to be composted into mulch . Buy a good chain saw , preferably from a local dealer who also services and repairs the same brand . Read the instruction book carefully and follow the directions . When you have to take the saw to the repair shop , try to stay while it is being repaired . This not only saves you making the trip back to pick it up , but also gives you an opportunity to learn how to do at least the more simple repairs yourself . You need a sledgehammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buy a sledgehammer that you can handle easily and two or three sharp steel wedges . You split the logs after they have been cut in fireplace lengths ( usually 18 to 24 inches ) . Stand a log on end and tap the sharp blade of a wedge into the wood with the sledgehammer . Usually when the wedge is one to three inches into the wood , the cut surface of the log will begin to crack . Stand another wedge in the crack and tap it i6o WINTER INCOME in . Tap the wedges alternately until the log splits in half . You may have to split some logs into quarters . Brute strength is not required . The wedges do most of the work . Try to keep the wedges and sledgehammer near the wood racks so that anyone passing by can split a log or two whenever he has a moment . This also is good pre-breakfast entertainment for guests once they have learned how it is done . Do not let an inexperienced guest attack this chore without instruction and supervised practice . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ log as far as it would go and then find that the log had not split and they could not remove the wedge . This results in frustrated guests , a battered wedge head and unsplit wood . To sell your wood , place a card announcing prices and the kind of wood in antique shops , on church bulletin boards , etc . You can put a sign up by your mail box but I do n't advise it . People tend to drop in when you are sitting down to dinner . Sometimes they want to pick through the racks to find the " nicest " logs . If you allow this , you may have to restack several cords . You can advertise in the classified section of the newspaper . I started in the business by putting up a card in my flea market booth . By the second season I had more orders than I could fill . My regular customers recommend me to friends and neighbors , so I always have a replacement when one of my customers moves . When I put up my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliveries and Sunday mornings . My antique market is in center city on Sundays . I thus save myself an extra trip to the city . Delivering on Sunday morning is best probably everywhere . Even if you have to double park , you can often get the wood off the truck before traffic backs up behind . To acquire a happy and loyal clientele , sell seasoned hardwood logs and give good measure . I have oak and cherry , but fruitwood , especially apple , is popular . I have read that birch logs burn more brightly than other kinds of wood . You will find customers especially appreciate quality . Some have ordered firewood at fancy prices and found they purchased half a cord of Christmas trees or telephone poles . // When a new customer calls , be sure to ask the width of his fireplace . From time to time a two-foot-wide fireplace , either very new or very old , will show up . The best log size is 12 to 15 inches , since the sides of the fireplace slant inward . Be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fraction of a cord , to be . A cord of wood is four feet wide , four feet high and eight feet long ( 128 cubic feet ) . Locally this is called a charcoal burner 's cord . Firewood is also sold by the " face cord " which is four feet high , eight feet long and eighteen to twenty-four inches wide ( the length of a fireplace log ) . Thus a face cord is half , or even a little less than half , the size of the official cord . If you use the face cord , as I do , be sure to explain this to each new customer or you may find yourself being accused of sharp practices . You will find that many customers will invite you in for coffee after the wood is stacked . By all means accept . Often they are curious to learn about life in the country and may become customers for some of your other products . Some even may become friends . If you have a chain saw and a truck , one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree removed from his property . If you can be reasonably sure that you can remove the tree without damaging buildings of wires , accept . Your fee will depend on whether the customer wants the entire tree hauled away or whether he wants it cut into log lengths for his own use . If you are to haul the tree away , you must now consider whether the wood will be saleable . A conifer , for example , is messy to trim , is not saleable , and will yield at best a couple of beanpoles for the garden and some mulching material when the side branches are shredded . My first phone call was a request to clear a wooded building lot . A friend and I cut and hauled away all the trees between 5 A.M. and 4 P.M. of a very hot July day . We were paid $75 and gained in addition about four cords of saleable firewood and a good supply of beanpoles from a thicket of swamp maple saplings . To sum up : Firewood is a good source of winter income provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not i62 WINTER INCOME have to hire outside help . It is an excellent way to improve your own woodland if you cut methodically so that there will be a crop of firewood for next year and for years to come . ANTIQUES , FURNITURE AND " COLLECTIBLES " THE ANTIQUE BUSINESS as a full-time occupation is best left to the professionals . Antiques of certain types on a small scale , however , are an ideal source of winter income . I got into the antique business gradually and unintentionally . I rented a booth one fall in an antique market with the idea of selling dried materials for flower arrangers . I displayed my cattails , cockscombs and honesty in crocks , jugs and Mason jars . I heaped my Indian corn in an old butchering kettle . I sold my flowers and my containers , too . I toured each booth thoughtfully , paying careful attention to the prices of the homey items I often saw at country sales ? wooden kitchen utensils , agateware and old-fashioned pottery mixing bowls . At the next auction I began buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long I had acquired a basic education in unpedigreed antiques ? the bare elements of which I pass on to you . You can buy all year long ? at auctions , yard sales and secondhand stores . Country auctions are often tedious to the city dweller because he is only interested in the antiques and he may have to sit or stand through hours of farm implements , household linens , pots and pans , and wicker porch sets . But to the homesteader the entire auction is of interest . Workshop tools and garden tools , bedspreads , quilts , blankets and rugs can usually be bought , in good condition , at a fraction of their store price . Mason jars ( not antique ) can often be bought at country auctions at 50 cents for a basket of two to three dozen jars . I go to auctions both to buy the things I need and to buy some things to sell . From spring to fall the items for sale are put away until winter and antique market time . The safest investment you , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functional , old furniture . I often buy a table , desk , or chest of drawers for less than $20 and sell it for $5o or more . Good furniture always sells well because everybody needs furniture . Out of a thousand people who pass your booth or drop into your shop , only two may be interested in Salopian ware or satin glass ? and one of them may be a fellow dealer who knows more than you do . But we all need furniture . A good deal of good secondhand furniture is cheap because it is painted . ( At auctions I believe furniture is often cheap because so many customers have no way of getting anything larger than an end table into their cars . When I see a lot of trucks and vans at a country sale , I expect the bidding for furniture to be high and am seldom disappointed . ) If a piece is intact , if it is not veneered , and if the design is good , it is a good buy . When you get the paint off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More often than not you will find what you expected to find ? a good but not great , solid , useful table , bureau or desk . Either way you have made money if your purchase price was sensible . Until you get the hang of packing and unpacking for markets , do try to deal in unbreakable pieces . But whether you 're buying furniture or Bavarian china , settle your top price firmly in your mind before the bidding begins . Do not go beyond that price . To do so is to succumb to auction fever , a malady you can not afford when you buy with selling in mind . To get some idea of prices for good , plain , refinished furniture , haunt the flea markets in your locale . Do not judge by the prices in fancy antique shops and shows . A table you have may look to you exactly like the $600 one in a " gallery . " But the gallery piece may be an original and yours only a latter-day reproduction . If you suspect you have a genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head for the library , check the pictures , dimensions , method of construction , type of wood , and signature if your piece is signed . If your research gives you hope , look up your piece in the price catalogs and tag it accordingly . Another way to arrive at a selling price is to find the price of a similar new piece in a retail furniture store . For example , I // bought a black chest of drawers for $3 at an auction . All summer I used it for tablecloths . When winter and refinishing time came , I discovered that the chest was solid cherry and that the front of each drawer was decorated with simple carving . The hardware proved to be brass . A similar chest of drawers in the furniture store was priced at $349 . So I priced my piece at $150 and a fellow dealer bought it immediately . He no doubt made a profit when he sold it , which brings us to an important point ? it is important that you settle with yourself your selling price as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices which usually mean a longer time until the sale is made . Higher prices lead to dreams of wealth which may engender greed . Meanwhile , too many pieces stay on hand too long , which is worrisome and threatens your peace of mind . Consider all factors ? the purchase price , refinishing materials , your time and store prices ? arrive at a good price and stick to it . Do not resent the profit your client may reap . Wish him instead a good and speedy sale so that he will buy again from you . Until you are an experienced refinisher , avoid veneer . Paint remover sometimes loosens veneer . Often , beneath the paint , the veneer is chipped or cracked . Unless you have infinite patience and enjoy tedious tasks , avoid heavily carved , painted furniture . Acanthus leaves and curlicues take hours to clean properly . Unless the piece is outstandingly odd , beautiful or grotesque , such effort is wasted . By and large the clientele at my antique market is apartment or small-townhouse dwellers . I soon learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly than larger pieces . These sizes have the advantage of being easy to move ? both for myself and for the customer , who usually manages to take his purchase with him . Avoid delivering furniture whenever possible . Customers often assume that dealers are interior decorators cum appraisers without portfolio . They often want four or five pieces of furniture moved in order to put the new acquisition in exactly the right spot . And while you 're there , they want to show you their last dozen or so purchases and to ask whether they paid a fair price . 165
