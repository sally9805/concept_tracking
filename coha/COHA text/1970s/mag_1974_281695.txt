Nelson Rockefeller found himself in a cruel predicament last week . Despite his long record of public service and philanthropy , insinuating leaks had ended any hope that his confirmation as Vice President would be a routine anointment . Instead , a long and partisan squabble was shaping up in Congress , and there seemed to be little that Rockefeller or the Ford Administration could do to head it off . <P> In the midst of his political troubles , Rockefeller announced that his wife was undergoing surgery for removal of a cancerous breast . It was a startling and melancholy coincidence : Happy Rockefeller 's modified radical mastectomy took place just 19 days after Betty Ford went through similar surgery . Mrs. Rockefeller had examined herself-just as countless other women did-after Mrs. Ford 's illness received wide publicity . The suspicious lump that Mrs. Rockefeller discovered turned out to be malignant , but at week 's end doctors at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan announced that she was in excellent condition . <P> Her husband divided his time between visiting the hospital and trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , Rockefeller himself disclosed that as a result of an Internal Revenue Service audit , he will have to pay an additional $896,173 in federal income and gift taxes for 1969-73 , plus interest of nearly $125,000 and additional gift taxes of $7,545 for the first half of 1974 . There was no hint of fraud of any kind . <P> <P> Among other things , the auditors disallowed $1,245,247 of his deductions for business expenses and charitable contributions , added $146,229 to his taxable income for foreign-exchange gains and charged him additional gift taxes of approximately $83,000 for 1972,1973 and the first half of 1974 . The effect of the settlement was to raise Rockefeller 's federal taxes for the five years by 21% , from $4,212,974 to $5,109,147 . During those years , his total income was about $20 million . <P> Routine Review . A routine review of Rocky 's taxes was in progress before the nomination . It was then expanded and became only one of several investigations in the confirmation process . The FBI deployed 350 agents across the country and compiled a generally favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a House Judiciary subcommittee . <P> In addition , Judiciary staff members and those of the Senate Rules Committee have been conducting their own probes . With so many investigations and so many investigators , leaks were all but inevitable . <P> By itself , the tax matter-despite the large sums involved-should have little impact on confirmation . But as one more item on a growing list , it complicated Rockefeller 's position . Another new problem last week : publicity about the fact that the Rockefeller family contributed $200,000 to President Nixon 's 1972 re-election campaign . Less than a year later , Nixon overruled the Civil Aeronautics Board and allowed Eastern Air Lines to acquire Caribair , a financially troubled airline based in Puerto Rico . At the time , Nelson owned no Eastern stock , but his brother Laurance is currently the airline 's largest individual stockholder ( with 1.75% ) . Laurance had sent Nixon a telegram urging him to permit the merger .
