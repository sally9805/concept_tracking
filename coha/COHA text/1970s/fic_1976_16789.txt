INT . KITCHEN where a couple of very young KITCHEN-HELPERS are horsing around , chasing and goosing each other as boys will do , laughing and having a great time among the pots and pans . One of them corners the other among the pots , and playfully threatens him . The smaller , cornered one , grabs two enormous pot-lids by their handles . As holding the great , glimmering pot-lids at arm 's length on either side of himself , with the exaggerated self-dramatics of which only youth is capable : &nbsp; SMALLER BOYAll right ! You fool with me , I put your ears out ! Suddenly he CLASHES the lids together . The audience knows to expect a loud sound , but nothing this loud . As the audience cringes , we CUT TO :  --  5  --  BRIEF SHOT - THE LARGER BOY holding forefingers in both ears and dancing around , half kidding , half in real pain , among the pots hanging from a central place in the room . We see him through the pots , the gleaming knives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clang comes . ( We do n't know if it is the original , or a SECOND . ) CUT TO : RAPHAEL eating tranquilly with the others . He does not even look up . Some of the other dogs do , momentarily , then go back to eating . CUT TO : Section Details INT . ROOM - NIGHT We see a whole room , and this seems to be standing deep in night . It is . The room is handsome , with what looks like a definitive law library , all books uniformly bound , on the shelves . JUDGE MILLER is seated in a comfortable chair a little to the right of center screen , reading in one of the books . Raphael is lying in front of the big fire in the grate , within reach of Judge Miller 's hand . The dog is staring into the fire patiently , completely relaxed , with his head on his paws . Every now and then he raises his head and looks into the fire from another position , as though he saw  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected was there or had not the wildest suspicion was there . At one of these times Judge Miller puts out a hand , and , without taking his concentration off his law-book , ruffles the dog 's fur in an abstracted , reassuring way , and goes on reading . The purpose of this scene is to give us a way to link up the contrasting images of fire : the fire in Judge Miller 's home and that in the Klondike with John Thornton , where fire is not comfort and affluence but life itself , and to add an additional poignancy to Thornton 's long confessional monologue as he talks to Buck in the white silence . CUT TO :  --  6  --  THE MILIAR FLOWER-GARDEN a huge one . We see the flowers CLOSE-UP , and then RAISE the CAMERA PAST the garden into an orchard , SHOOTING DOWN one of the openings between the regularly-set fruit-trees . Into the f.g. , and going AWAY FROM THE CAMERA , appear the gardener , MANUEL , and Raphael , walking in a leisurely fashion as though old friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly with Manuel as he is with the other people around the estate . He knows him and trusts him . &nbsp; MANUEL ( slightly broken accent , Mexican-American ) Come on wid me , and we will have a nice walk through the orchard . SERIES OF SHOTS of the two of them walking along through the stately orchard-rows , just having an idle outing . Manuel has one of his flowers in his hand , and ends up by sticking it in his hat , a kind of modified sombrero . Again we see them moving AWAY FROM CAMERA and this time Manuel reaches back in his right hip pocket and pulls out , only a little , a length of rope with a chain on it . We must film this so that there is no great dramatic import to it , but the gesture must register with the audience . CUT TO : END OF THE ORCHARD and a short stretch of sandy road . Rafe has probably never been here , and there is a certain questioning in how he responds to the place . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a real flag-station or whistle-stop , that man and dog seem to be proceeding toward . We FOLLOW them as they get to the station , in no particular hurry . Manuel talks amiably of the money he has won , over the last few years , on Chinese lottery . &nbsp; MANUELBut these last days I lose big . I got five cheeldren . You know that , do n't you ? Sure , you know it . You got a big smart head . You the smartest dog I ever see in my life . You know a man 's got ta live , just like a dog 's got ta live . Nothing 's easy . There is only one man at the station . CUT TO :  --  7  --  MAN AT STATION lounged up against the weathered boards beside the door . He is a little rough-looking , but not overly so . He has the air of someone who is waiting at this particular place for a reason , and the slightly-anxious appearance of a man awaiting an appointment for which it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO : RAFE showing his size , the condition of his coat , his fine shape , his blue eyes . MAN we ZOOM SLOWLY from the STRANGER to Rafe as though we saw the dog with the Stranger 's eyes , as though the dog , innocent and friendly , were the answer to something in the Stranger 's desire . BUCK ( I 'll call him BUCK from now on in the script , although he is not named that until Thornton names him so ) is a little perplexed by all this . THREE SHOT - BUCK AND THE TWO MEN as the Stranger comes up to Manuel and Buck and puts out a hand as if to pet Buck , but does not actually touch him . The Stranger straightens , and he and Manuel look at each other , as with a tacit understanding . &nbsp; STRANGERGood . Very good . &nbsp; MANUELIf thees one can not pull , ees no dog can . He weigh hundred and forty pound , and he is smart as a man . Sure . He is smarter than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; STRANGER ( with a slightly mean smile ) Well , he might some of the time . But he do n't now . ( pause ) You say fifty dollars . Here it is.  --  8  --  Stranger pulls out a roll of dirty bills and some coins . Far away a TRAIN WHISTLE is heard , not once but several times , and in between the whistle-echoes the chink of coins can be made out , almost inaudible , but we must shoot this scene as though they had a certain fateful sound : a sound of finality , of betrayal , like the thirty pieces of silver . &nbsp; STRANGERBut you got to wrap up the goods . ( pause ) I tell you , I can use every big dog I can get . Up there  --  ( he points , presumably toward the North )  --  they sure need ' em . Dogs wear out up there faster than we can send ' em , or buy ' em . And there 's more and more people going . Gold , brother , gold . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour if you know where to go .

But there 's people that ai n't ever gon na forgive ' emselves if they do n't try . If I knew I ' us gon na have a bunch of dogs like this ' un , I might try it myself . &nbsp; MANUEL ( smiling , and suddenly easy-going and likeable ) I 'll stick to my flowers . He touches flower in hat , and then he says , a little ruefully , with a shrug , a certain resignation : &nbsp; MANUELAnd my Chinese lottery . I got a seestem . But a seestem needs money . The Stranger looks at Manuel with a certain ironic pity . &nbsp; STRANGERJesus . A system-player . You do need money !  --  9  --  ( pause ) But I 'll tell you , you 're gon na die broke . All the dogs in California ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be a thousand Klondike gold rushes , and none of it 's gon na do you any good . ( pause ) A gambler who 's a system-player . My Lord . ( shakes his head incredulously ; pause ) Train 's coming in . Put a choke-chain on this gambling fool 's foolishness . ( pause ; the Stranger breaks into a grin ) And good luck to you . And I 'll let you in on something . I did go . I like to have died fifty times . There just ai n't nothing like the gold-fever . I 'm gon na take this dog back up there myself , and if I do n't get what I want for him , I 'm gon na get myself a team and get back out on the trail myself . I do think I know a place ai n't nobody ever been . I know there 's gold there . I know it ! &nbsp; MANUELWell , good luck to you , too . &nbsp; STRANGERWhen we drink up there , there 's a kind of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it . &nbsp; MANUELWhat is it ? The Stranger raises his hand with an invisible glass in it , with slight ruefulness , but with an undercurrent of excitement impossible to miss , and with his hand held higher , perhaps higher than necessary . Before he speaks : CUT TO : BUCK taking it all in , and then : CUT TO :  --  10  --  THE THREE OF THEM with the Stranger 's gesture oddly poignant . CUT TO : THE STRANGER in an odd mixture of irony and an almost religious being- **40;3160;TOOLONG , so that the sardonics leak out of his words , and fervor catches them . &nbsp; STRANGERA health to the man on the trail this night ; may his grub hold out , may his dogs keep their legs ... FLASH briefly to Buck again . Then the Stranger finishes the toast : &nbsp; STRANGER ... may his matches never miss fire . There is a brief pause while the three assimilate the toast . The train pulls in , and it is obvious that it is the most temporary of halts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only a moment or two at the station . &nbsp; STRANGERLet 's get him on . We now see Manuel SHOT FROM BEHIND , the Stranger 's face over his shoulder . Manuel 's hand goes to his right back pocket , and takes out the piece of rope we have previously seen in the orchard . Buck looks up inquiringly as Manuel doubles the piece of rope under Buck 's collar . BRIEF CLOSEUP - ROPE showing its quality of terrible cruelty . BACK TO SCENE Buck submits to this treatment without objection , for , like any dog , he trusts anyone he knows , and has so far no reason to think he is in danger of any sort . Even so , he pulls back a little , for he is not used to having physical restraints put upon him . Manuel gives a kind of demonstrational twist to the rope , looks up as though he were a little proud of his handling of the situation , and says :  --  11  --  &nbsp; MANUELTweest thees and you can choke heem plenty . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STRANGERWell , you can lay all your damned flower-money that I ai n't gon na do that . In a slightly ceremonial but quite practical gesture of transfer , Manuel hands over the rope to the Stranger . Buck growls uneasily . CLOSEUP - THE STRANGER 'S BIG - SCARRED HANDS as he methodically tightens the rope . Buck begins to pant heavily , losing breath . Then he explodes and goes with pure , tormented-animal instinct , for the Stranger . The Stranger , used to these encounters , flips Buck over in mid-air , and Buck falls on his back on the sagging boards of the platform so hard that he breaks one of them . It is a scene of such cold brutal aggression toward an animal that the audience should wince at it , but the most horrible part of the act should be its dreadful practicality . The Stranger kneels down and chokes Buck until he passes out , or almost . SHOT - THE TWO MEN picking Buck up and throwing him into the baggage car . INT . BAGGAGE CAR - MOVING TRAIN The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stranger , though he still has hold of the rope around Buck 's neck , is distracted by his conversation , which is taking place by the weird light of a coal-oil railroad lamp . CUT TO : BUCK lying on the strawy floor , and COME IN to TIGHT CLOSEUP on him as the blue eyes flicker in the light and open . We see that deadly , optical blue . Then the eyes narrow down . Buck pants , getting his breath . CUT TO :  --  12  --  REVERSE ANGLE - FROM BUCK 'S POV &nbsp; STRANGER ( to Baggage Man ) Yeah , this big bugger 's taken to throwing fits . Must be the distemper or something . I 'm taking him up to Frisco for my boss-man . Supposed to be a good dog-doctor up there . May be able to do something for him . Long SOUND of train WHISTLE , with tremendous melancholy and travel-urgency . The Stranger leans back toward the lantern-light , and his conversation . Suddenly , Buck leaps . The lantern , which swings on a chain of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows of the beginning and the end  --  over the car , as there is the confusion of man-voices , and the SNARLS of the outraged dog . The lantern swings , and in one of the light-swings we see that Buck has the Stranger by the hand . He is shaking the hand in the terrible way that animals have when they want to tear something off : a limb , meat from the bone . &nbsp; STRANGER ( screams ) Get him off me . Do something ! He 's got me ! He 's got me ! SHOT - THE BAGGAGE MAN who has no experience in such matters , circling in and out of the wildly inaccurate light of the hanging lantern , trying to assess the situation , trying to figure out what to do with this no-nonsense savagery of an animal he never had the slightest idea he 'd ever have to deal with . Buck is still trying to tear the hand off , but finally the Baggage Man , showing more courage than he knew he had , grabs hold of Buck 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head away from the Stranger 's hand . There is blood all over Buck 's muzzle , and some on the floor of the car : random spots . SHOT - THE STRANGER in the still-swaying lantern , wrapping his hand in a handkerchief . We should be able to convey the fact that he is terribly shaken by the event .  --  13  --  His eyes , holding points of the swaying light , are the eyes of a man who has learned something he did n't know before . But he seems to hold no malice toward Buck . He shows only awe and wonder as he binds up his hand , awkwardly , in the strange light . CUT TO : Section Details A LITTLE SHED - BACK OF A WATERFRONT SALOON This is evidently the clearing-house of the Klondike dog-trade . The Stranger has most surely been here before , perhaps many times . CLOSEUP - STRANGER his hand still wrapped in bloody handkerchief . He is talking to a FAT MAN who is evidently the owner of the saloon . &nbsp; SALOON-KEEPERI saw that big devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He do n't take no easy answers . &nbsp; STRANGERWell , how much will you give for him ? &nbsp; SALOON-KEEPERI think a hundred and fifty would n't be too much . ( pause ) But say : listen . When you were in here last time , you told me that if you could get a good dog-team together , you were gon na go back up there and try again . Looks to me like you got a good start on a team with that big ' un out back . You talk about pulling : he looks like he could pull the Devil up by the roots . The Stranger ruefully holds up his bandaged hand , through which his blood is still seeping . &nbsp; STRANGERYou 're right . I 've changed my mind . When that dog got hold of my hand last night , I just figured gold was n't all that important .  --  14  --  &nbsp; SALOON-KEEPERIt is to everybody else . You ought to see some of the people that come through here , trying to get up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds . You 'd think they ought to be locked up , or something . They ca n't talk about anything but gold , they ca n't think about anything but gold . A man would believe they had to eat it to stay alive . The conversation should reveal the Stranger as really not such a bad fellow , after all : he simply uses a certain amount of cruelty to animals because dog-trading is his chosen profession , temporarily . &nbsp; STRANGERWell , there 're all kinds up there . Poor men , men who are already rich but for some reason want more money , successes , failures , all kinds . All kinds of men and all kinds of dogs . Some of those teams up there have got the craziest mix of dogs in ' em you could imagine . No ; I take that back . You could n't imagine ' em . You 'd have to see ' em . All the time I was up there , I never saw one team that was all pure-bred Husky , or Malamute . On some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe even a Husky . One time I saw two Huskies on the same team . But never more than that . That 's why we 've got old Big Boy out here in back . You 're paying me a hundred and fifty dollars for him . If he can be worked with  --  and I think he can : he 's awful smart  --  he 'll bring five hundred up there . ( pause , holding up his now quite bloody , bandaged hand ) Listen , I 've never seen such a quick big dog in my life , and I 've seen many a dog , like you more than most would know I have . He was lying on the floor of the damned baggage car , and then , before I could , even pull back my hand , he had hold of it .  --  15  --  I sure pity any of them Klondike dogs that gets in a fight with this one , I can tell you . He 'll cut ' em up right quick . He 's got it all : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd bet all the gold I 'm not gon na get , on that . &nbsp; SALOON-KEEPER ( leaning back , relaxing , and talking friend-to-friend ) And you 're not going back after all , Frank . You were sure as hell for going back last time I talked to you . You said you knew a place  --  I think you said it was near Bella Coola  --  ( Or some Alaskan-sounding name : a very distinctive-sounding name : one the audience will remember later , when Thornton goes there and makes the strike . ) &nbsp; SALOON-KEEPER ( continuing )  --  where you could make a million dollars in a week . &nbsp; STRANGER ( ruefully ) Otto , I would n't know what to do with a million dollars if I had it . ( pause ) But the stuff is at Bella Coola . I know damn well it is . The trouble is , Bella Coola is so blasted hard to get to . You got to sled-dog it for two weeks at least from Dawson City , and you got to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even . &nbsp; SALOON-KEEPER ( in friendly puzzlement ) Frank , I still do n't know why you changed your mind about going back . You 've got the experience , you think you know where the gold is , everybody but you is crazy to get up there ...  --  16  --  &nbsp; STRANGER ( with absolute conviction ) Yeah , they 're crazy . " Gold fever " ai n't just a name . It is , I can tell you , a kind of a disease . A lot of men  --  mostly just fairly good men , some of ' em fairly bad men , some real bad  --  are dying of gold fever right now , just  --  right now . Tonight . He raises his wounded hand in a resigned , sweeping gesture to indicate the night around them . &nbsp; STRANGERNow. ( pause ) When that big dog grabbed me last night and tried to tear off my hand  --  and he was just about to do it , too  --  listen  --  ( he holds up hand ) I need that hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner ) ... To steal more dogs with ! &nbsp; STRANGERYeah , and sell ' em to you , you money-hungry pussel-gut. ( pause ) But when I felt my hand-bones crunch , when I felt them big wild teeth meet , right in the middle of my palm , and bear down , and then him shake and tear , I knew I did n't want to go back . There 's the dogs that you have to have to live  --  some of them would just as soon kill you as look at you , and some of ' em 'd rather  --  and there 's the cold you ca n't get away from , and ... and ... He continues his monologue , but with a subtle change . He is talking now to himself , or to a ghost , or to maybe even God . He speaks as a man both terrified and exalted by the vision he 's trying to enunciate.  --  17  --  &nbsp; STRANGER ... and there 's the snow . Snow everywhere . Nothing but snow . He looks around at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no particular emphasis , and then COMES BACK to the Stranger 's coarse , tough-guy 's terrified , staring and musing face . &nbsp; STRANGER ... there 's that white silence . ( long pause ) And that burnin ' daylight . CUT TO : &nbsp; pp. 18-34 OTHER MEN dragging Buck from his cage , choking and bullying him along . They throw him down on the ground and hold him , and we COME IN CLOSE with the CAMERA to show one of the men filing the heavy brass collar off his neck . SHOT OF MEN dragging and throwing Buck into a moveable crate . He growls and snaps at the bars , trying to get at the men . One of them walks away , making a gesture of don't-bother-me . These men are used to frustrated , uncomprehending and dangerous dogs . They could n't care less about the state of any dog 's psychology . They are making money out of shipping dogs to Alaska for the use of people involved in the Klondike gold rush , and that is all there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of how to do this most effectively , how to get hold of as many big dogs as they can , how to get as much money for them as they can , how to transport them with as little difficulty to themselves as may be possible , and how not to get bitten in the process . CUT TO : BUCK IN THE CRATE We play his frustrated , brought-out savagery against the indifferent casualness of the men . He growls a little , lunges at the bars once , a terrifying CLOSEUP , and then lies down . We COME IN CLOSE on the blue eyes . He closes them , and lies down . CUT TO :  --  18  --  THE OUTSIDE OF THE CAGE We see total night through the bars , but there is a sickly , human-made light on Right Screen , from the saloon . Then , within that , there is another , wavering light , and we can not guess the source . CUT TO : CLOSEUP - CANDLE shining between the bars of the cage , just outside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking into Buck 's cage with a strange mixture of curiosity and respect . &nbsp; SALOON-KEEPER ( shaking his head in incredulity ) A hundred and fifty dollars . A hundred and fifty dollars . You might make a man millions of dollars . You could , or you could n't . God knows what 's going to happen to you , Big Boy . God knows . GO TO BLACK . FADE IN : THE SCREEN is violently agitated and lurching with sickening purposelessness . We are again INSIDE THE CAGE with Buck , and it is being moved by four men . From this vantage point there are visible , at least several times , the loutish , sneering faces of totally , brutal , tiresome and ignorant men , dressed badly , unshaven , ragged . The CAMERA LURCHES and SWAYS , as Buck would be doing under these conditions , and we catch the glimpses of these disgusting , rat-like men through the bars . One of them gets a hand loose and pokes at Buck with a broken stick , cruelly jagged . Buck snarls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CUT TO : SHOT OF MEN loading the crate on a wagon . With Buck are other dogs on the same wagon .  --  19  --  There is a strange chorus , at first dissonant in the extreme , but finally gathering together into a harmony of some animal sort , of barks , snaps , whines , howls and snarls . We FIX for a moment on these transported dogs , these unlikely fellow-passengers , and then we PULL BACK to a rear TRACKING SHOT that shows the wagon is moving off . The SOUNDS DIMINISH , but only very slowly . At the END OF THE SHOT , we still hear them . CUT TO : EXPRESS OFFICE A CLERK making out a bill of lading . He peers down at Buck , noting his red eyes and slaver . &nbsp; CLERK ( to DRIVER ) That thing ca n't get out of there , can he ? Looks to me like you got a mad dog on your hands . &nbsp; DRIVER ( signing bill ) No , not any more . Now you got one on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got him nailed down good . CUT TO : SHOT - BUCK snarling and leaping , and we COME IN CLOSE on his muzzle projecting through the bars , dripping saliva in which there is a tinge of what may very well be blood . CUT TO : ANOTHER ANGLE - BUCK being put into yet another wagon , this one very much unlike the others  --  the contrast must be startling  --  and carried off once again . This time he is with no other dogs , but among parcels and crates : everything but him has been transmuted , in our SHOT , to supplies for the Klondike .  --  20  --  We PAN OVER the inanimate things in the crates surrounding Buck , the only living creature carried as cargo in the wagon . There are boxes labelled shovels , others labelled picks , and so on , through the paraphernalia of the miner 's equipment . There may be one box that has partially burst open under the jolting , and the business-end of a pick may be seen sticking out . Further PAN , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crazy angle , as if it were being pointed to shoot something quite literally beyond belief . BUCK 'S CRATE - TWILIGHT being put on a baggage loading truck . This has an extra long wagon-tongue . He is alone on the truck , and we SHOOT THE SCENE against the sea , so that both baggage men and dog are back-lit by the sun falling into the horizon . BRIEF CUT - SMALL FERRY STEAMER very much a type of its time , and then CUT BACK to the truck and Buck 's cage , with the last of the Pacific sun raying through it . From what brief glimpse we get of Buck , he does not seem enraged at all at this time , but rather interested , and these particular men do not seem cruel and taunting , but rather fun-loving , as they try , perhaps without adequate manpower , to guide the awkward carriage down the steep  --  the too-steep  --  ramp . There are various shouts of caution and control , and a good deal of incoherent raillery . At one point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle may have gotten away from them , and is headed into the water , but one enterprising fellow manages to get hold of the handle of the wagon-tongue and gets it headed into the steamer 's hold again . CUT TO : TWILIGHT SHOT in which both the coming dark and the violence of the dying sun are even more apparent , and in this scene the men moving Buck into the ship seem , in a backlit and medieval , dance-of death way , to dance as they negotiate the truck down the ramp . ( NOTE : The point of this whole sequence of travel is to show by what extremely devious and various ways Buck is transported to the Klondike .  --  21  --  None of the different episodes of transportation need , in itself , last very long , but I want there to be a good many of them . As many , say , as I have indicated . There should be a distinctive tone to each one , and the emphasis should be on the variety of modes of transportation , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a dog would be thoroughly confused as to what is happening to him . He is riding the various machines of men this way , that way , at this time of day and at that time of night , and , to him , there is no apparent purpose to any of it . He is just hungry and thirsty , and most of the time , mad as hell . ) CUT TO : BUCK being put into yet another train . This time he is back with other dogs , and no human beings at all . There is a brief scene at which the train stops . The dogs are being neither fed nor watered . NIGHT SHOT An uncaring face looks into the baggage-car . &nbsp; VOICEYou do n't need no goddamned water . At this , and as the man closes the door , the chorus of dog-suffering voices rises to a crescendo . SHOT OF BUCK pacing his cage , restlessly , in the manner of lions in zoos , two steps this way , two that way , turn , two back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his tongue out . BUCK 'S POV Man-legs walk by . SHOT - FROM OUTSIDE THROUGH BARS OF CAGE Buck is panting heavily . As a man goes by between the CAMERA and Buck , temporarily darkening the screen , we hear Buck whine , and then CUT again to shot of Buck through the slats , head up now , sniffing , evidently expecting something : expecting to be given food , expecting water . The legs go past , and are not seen again .  --  22  --  PULL BACK as Buck snarls and then whines , then unexpectedly howls in frustration . MED . SHOT The shadow-figures of men , talking casually a few feet away . There is a soft , inconsequential laugh . CLOSEUP - BUCK so that we see that the whites of his eyes are reddening . &nbsp; VOICEYoung fellow , you ai n't been around this train very long . If every dog that 's in that car was to get loose , all at the same time , you would n't last two seconds . They ai n't had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( inexperienced ) But why do n't you give ' em something to eat ? Why in God 's name , do n't you give ' em something to drink ? This conversation must be played quietly and urgently , using the train door to muffle the intonations , but still allowing them to be audible . &nbsp; VOICEBecause we do n't know what 's been done to these dogs , by the time they get along this far . They 're going to the Klondike . God knows how they got to us . But you just ca n't go near ' em . You might want to try . But I sure wouldn't. ( pause ) We 'll be in Seattle in about fourteen more hours . Most of these damned muts 'll get through all right . And if they do n't , we 'll just throw ' em in the bay . ( pause ) We 've throwed a many a one in . Sometimes a pair of human legs walks past , and Buck growls . Sometimes , in what appears to be the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start up from sleep , and growls in exactly the same way .  --  23  --  SHOT - BUCK 'S POV from interior of cage . Suddenly there is a brilliant scan of water across the CAMERA , backlit by one of the lamps of the train . Someone is hosing the floor down . This SHOT might even leave a few drops of water on the CAMERA LENS . Buck is trying to do something to the slats of the cage . We COME IN CLOSE on his head , and see that he is trying to lick the drops of random water from the slats . It should be evident , here , that his thirst is terrible . SHOT FROM OUTSIDE showing Buck trying to lick the outside of the slats , get his tongue around the half-damp boards . Anything . We COME IN SUPER-CLOSE on Buck 's head , and we can not but note that his eyes , around the blue irises , are fiery red . BUCK lying low in the corner of the crate , his head angled in the CAMERA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck 's crate off the little train . A STOUT MAN in a conspicuously red and ill-fitting sweater comes out and signs for the crate , and signs with even something of a flourish . The Man in the Red Sweater goes over to a kind of makeshift , outdoor table and brings back , his hands focussing briefly in CLOSEUP , a hatchet and a club . We should then PAN up to show his hideously toothless and monstrously ruthless face . The Man in the Red Sweater starts using the hatchet to pry off the slats of Buck 's cage-crate . CUT TO : Section Details SHED NEAR BUCK 'S CRATE Two sleazy-looking HANGERSON are there , peering apprehensively at the operation . We should play this scene , as to their part in it , for a kind of semi-comic relief . They are definitely no-good types , but they are also clownish as well as being cloddish . They are about as close to being tramps as one could possibly get . Perhaps they are in fact tramps.  --  24  --  &nbsp; FIRST CLODYou mean Digger is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Look at the size of him ! And he looks like a mad dog , too . Looks to me like he 's got the hydrophoby . Look at that white stuff all over his head .

TWO SHOT - CLODS hovering anxiously near the door of the shed . &nbsp; FIRST CLOD ( continuing ) Come on , Max . Let 's git in there . I do n't want to be here when that big bastard gits out .

Then their two heads timidly reappear , just peeking through the merest crack between the door and the jamb . &nbsp; SECOND CLODBe ready to close this thing in a hurry .  --  25  --  &nbsp; FIRST CLOD ( in fearing awe ) Lord God A'mighty ! Would you look at that ! CLOSEUP - BUCK 'S SLAVERING BLUE AND RED-EYED HEAD SHOT - BUCK 'S POV We see , through the slats of the cage , as Buck would see him , the Man in the Red Sweater . At first he is in dim focus . All we . see , as Buck would see , is something red . Then , slowly , very slowly , we FOCUS on the Man . He has a heavy club in his right hand , and he is balanced on his toes like a boxer . He is a dreadful-looking , toothless man with a wild mop of hair , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in possession of some kind of terrible expertise . We watch him as Buck would watch him , dancing , getting ready for the encounter . QUICK CUTS - CLODS in the shed , peering fearfully and expectantly out . BUCK 'S POV as he looks , a little shaky with hunger and fury , at the Man . &nbsp; MANCome out , you red-eyed devil . ( pause ) Bust that crate open , boys . We are still looking at the Man from Buck 's POV . Suddenly there is a thunderous NOISE , as of someone beating you on the head with a heavy hammer . SHOT - MEN standing on Buck 's crate , breaking it open with hammers and axes . BACK TO BUCK 'S POV It is dark there , but suddenly daylight bursts in with a wild unexpectedness.  --  26  --  Suddenly the SCREEN is bare white , and all we see is a blur of unfocussed red : the red sweater . In the midst of the new light , we hear Buck 's growl , and then the growl increases until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal . With the CAMERA , we spring with Buck , right at the Man . SHOT - CLUB descending . Let 's shoot this in SLOW MOTION . NORMAL-SPEED SHOT of utter confusion . We turn the CAMERA AROUND , to suggest the view of Buck 's being knocked in a complete somersault , knocked quite literally head-over-heels . We show him crash to the ground , stunned , half on head and half on one shoulder . We show the wild glint in the eyes of Red Sweater . The CAMERA WHIRLS in a kind of ballet of violence and brutality . Buck charges again and again , but now he is not snarling nearly so loudly . CLODS IN THE SHED who are now cautiously emerging . &nbsp; SECOND CLOD ( in some awe ) See what I mean ? &nbsp; FIRST CLODI sure do . He shore ai n't no slouch at dog-breaking . But I 'd ruther break horses any day in the week and twice on Sunday , than do what he 's doing . &nbsp; SECOND CLODNaw . SOUND of club striking Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SECOND CLOD ( going on ) He likes it . He 'd do it for nuthin ' . CLOSEUP - MAN 'S TOOTHLESS FACE with on it the expression of a depraved and utterly merciless boxer who has his opponent down , and wants him to get up so he can hit him again . &nbsp; MANGit up , Big ' Un . You got a lot to learn .  --  27  --  BRIEF CUT - BUCK lying on his side , with the Man standing over him , the club in readiness . BUCK 'S POV We now have the CAMERA SIDEWAYS , as from Buck 's position , and the Man , again , unfocussed , as though seen from a brain knocked half unconscious . Slowly the Man in the Red Sweater comes INTO FOCUS , still sideways . Then , as we hear Buck begin to growl again , we turn the CAMERA to indicate Buck righting himself and getting to his feet . Suddenly we , the audience , explode as though we were Buck , again . We go forward in a rush , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOTION SHOT - CLUB as before . SHOT - BUCK down again , the Man dancing in his odd mixture of grace and brutality . SHOT - MAN smacking the club lightly into his other palm . &nbsp; MANJust depends how much you want . If I ' us you , I 'd give up . Save yourself some trouble . CAMERA ANGLES to Clods , as they walk toward Red Sweater , walking now with even a hint of a swagger . One of the Clods bends experimentally down and touches Buck 's head , and he straightens and looks at the blood on his hand . He then looks down at Buck again . &nbsp; SECOND CLODI think you got a little too rough with this ' un , Digger . I believe you done killed him . &nbsp; RED SWEATER ( matter-of-factly ) Nah . I ai n't never killed but one dog in my life , and that was when I was just startin ' out . He was almost as big as this red-eyed , blue-eyed devil . But he did n't have the guts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about dog-breaking back when they struck it rich up yonder . Dog acted like he was tryin ' to eat me up , and I got scared and beat him to death .  --  28  --  ( pause ) Cost me a load of money , too . But I learned something . I ai n't never done it again . ( pause ) Just like old red-and-blue eyes here . He learned something . And he ai n't never gon na forget that , either . I guaran-damn-tee you he ai n't . CLOSEUP - BUCK Feebly raising his head . It almost immediately sinks back , in a gesture of complete defeat and **34;3202;TOOLONG . EXTREME CLOSEUP his bloodshot blue eyes , as he closes them . MED . SHOT - BUCK struggling to sit up . INTO FRAME comes an arm in a red sweater , with a pan of water . SHOT - BUCK lapping with insane greediness . Beside the pan from which he is drinking , the red arm places another pan containing large chunks of meat . Buck drinks and eats , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for another commercial break , if desired . ) FADE IN : MED . SHOT showing Buck back in his cage . There are many other dog-cages and crates around him . SOUND in which some dogs are heard snarling , some yapping , some howling , some whining . Evidently some time has passed , for Buck is no longer bloody . He is lying still , watching what is going on all around him . There is a confusion of human feet and legs walking past , the sound of voices , amongst the dog-sounds . Gradually , out of this animal-human cacophony , it becomes apparent that some of the voices are price-haggling with others . Bargains are all being made at the same time , and just what the specific bargains are is not clear . But it is clear that they are bargains .  --  29  --  SHOT We see from cage interior , a cage picked up and taken away . This should happen Right Screen . Then , Left Screen , another . There is a short sequence of this bargaining and cage-lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and time . Then , as to sound , we CUT BACK on the dog-noises , and two human voices dominate what we hear . One of the voices is clearly that of the Red Sweater , but the other is one we have not heard before . It is a half-English , half-French Canadian voice , and this last is excited . &nbsp; FRENCH CANADIAN VOICESacredam ! Dat one dog ! Dat one two-dog ! Eh ? How much ? &nbsp; RED SWEATER VOICEThree hundred , and I 'm making you a present at that . You always pay up . That ought to go for a little extra something . But I can tell you : He 's beat down now , but he 'll come back . And when he does , he 'll tear you apart like a rotten croker-sack . I do n't sell him to you just for the money . I want you to come back down here to Seattle and buy some more dogs . And you ai n't gon na do it if this blue-eyed boy rips your head off . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing over your bones , in some God-forsaken territory up there . And I can tell you , if you buy him , you 're gon na have to watch him . Watch him until you know him . And until he knows you . It ai n't gon na work no other way . Not with him . He 's a big strong mutt . There 're plenty of those . But he 's smart , too , and that means he knows when to make his move . Do n't turn your back on him . That 's all I 'm gon na say . Do n't give him a chance at you , or you ai n't gon na be buying no more dogs . From me , or from anybody else . SHADOWY TWO SHOT - RED SWEATER AND PERRAULT passing money . &nbsp; RED SWEATERAnd you ai n't out a damned thing . It 's government money . Right , Perrault ? ( pause ) Hope you make that strike . ( now all dog-business ) Have I got you ? This big blue-eye and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call the Newfoundland Curly . We never have got around to getting a name for Blue Eyes . Somebody else 'll have to do that for him . Section Details SHOT - BUCK being lifted in his cage yet one more time . This time the dock is far more a large commercial-type affair than the one having to do with the previous ship , the ferry-boat . SHOT - RATHER LARGE OCEAN-GOING SHIP black , and with an orange-red waterline . BRIEF CUT BACK TO DOG MARKET In a shostly shadow-play , accompanied by far-off snarls and growls , and one last muffled thump of the club , we see and hear Red Sweater breaking one more dog : which one is unknown to us : just a new arrival . LONG SHOT - THE SHIP called the NARWHAL , stearing away . The ship is a little reminiscent of the old Mississippi River paddle-wheelers , adapted for northern waters . SUCCESSION OF SHOTS ship plying between a number of islands , lovely at various times of day , lovely in cinematography . MED SHOT between-decks dog-cages . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniffing around , trying to get his muzzle through the cage to investigate and be friendly with anybody . Just anybody . We next see a morose , defeated dog of another kind who does not respond to Curly 's advances and only wishes to be left alone . Then , in another PAN , a huge , cloud-white dog , obviously from somewhere in the extreme north of Europe . He is from Spitzbergen , and is known , already , as SPITZ . He is shown as restless , the proverbial caged , pacing beast . The PAN now comes to rest on Buck , who is lying in his customary blue-eyed , thinking and plotting position , relaxedly alert . SCENE Where PERRAULT and his black-bearded partner , FRANCOIS , are attempting to get acquainted with their new dogs . They let the dogs out of their cages to feed them , for there will be no cages on the trail .  --  31  --  BRIEF CLOSEUP - FOUR PANS OF FOOD for these men know dogs , and they know that , at this stage of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , all four , going after the same food . TWO SHOT - FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT in the strange half-light of ship-basements . They are watching the dogs warily , not necessarily expecting trouble , but experienced and ready for it if it should come . SHOT OF DOGS EATING &nbsp; PERRAULT ( v.o . ) We got de makin 's of a might ' good team here , Francois . TWO SHOT - IN HALF-LIGHT &nbsp; FRANCOISIt do look like it . ( pause ) I do n't know nodden about de odders . I know dat big blue-eye , he come from some place in California . ( pause ) Only one I know anyt'ing about is that big Spitzbergen dog . SHOT - SPITZ and the ghostly ship-hold light emphasizes his paleness , his look as though he were made for the Arctic , the snow and the cold . He seems almost to glow with this quality . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o. ) ( continuing ) He been all over the world , dat dog . He come to us on whaler . Capitain stole him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his life up above the Circle . He been up in the Barrens . &nbsp; PERRAULT ( v.o . ) What you know ' bout Barrens , Francois ? Ai n't no gold in de Barrens.  --  32  --  &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o . ) No , dose people lookin ' for some odder kind of rocks . &nbsp; PERRAULT ( v.o . ) Ai n't no rocks worth nothin ' , but gold . SHOT OF DOGS still eating voraciously . &nbsp; PERRAULT ( v.o. ) ( after pause ) We got a team , Francois . We got a real team , dis time . We gon ' be rich . Wid dese dog  --  dis Spitz and dis big California blue-eye  --  we gon ' get all the gold in the Klondike . Wid dese dog , we go where nobody else go . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o. ) ( as we watch dogs eating ) Ever ' - thing depends on lead dog . He good lead dog , we get de gold . He not good , we get killed . TWO SHOT - MEN &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Speetz ! You make us reech , you hear ? SHOT - DOGS eating , almost finished . Buck and Spitz are next to each other . CLOSEUP - DOGS eating greedily . PULL BACK the SHOT , and we see Spitz try to get something , a bone , from Buck 's dish . SHOT - FRANCOIS with whip , cracking it down on Spitz , who drops the gone and cowers.  --  33  --  SHOT - BUCK snarling a little , retrieving the bone and going off in a corner of the ' tween-decks with it , and lying down with it as though justified : as though justice had been recognized and enforced . Perrault speaks admiringly , and with not a little awe at his and Francois ' extreme luck : &nbsp; PERRAULTLook at dose two ! SHOT - DOGS who have now finished eating . We FRAME the shot so as to show Spitz and Buck at a kind of odd angle to each other , but we shoot this in such a way to show that each is very aware of the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little dreamily ) We gon ' get there , Francois . We gon ' go ! &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( after long pause ) We goin ' somewhere we ai n't never been . LONG SHOT - THE NARWHAL making through Queen Charlotte Sound , with its ever-rough water . DISSOLVE TO : DOG-CAGES which begin to sway and pitch unaccountably . The dogs sway with the sea , try to brace themselves , lose their legs , roll against the suddenly canted sides of their cages , whine , get upright again , are tossed to fall against the opposite sides of their cages . SHOT - BUCK fighting with the others , this unaccountable disequilibrium.  --  34  --  Then , with his characteristic and ever-growing cunning , knowing he can do nothing about what is happening , he lies down as though back : at Judge Miller 's before the armchair fire , and goes to sleep . The blue eyes close , and we see him roll back and forth contentedly , as though in one of those railway cars that railroad executives have installed in their home bedrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , sleep . Buck looks right at home . SEQUENCE - TIME-PASSING SHOTS at discretion of director . The point of the sequence is to show the Narwhal passing through increasingly northern latitudes , and . into increasingly wilder kinds of landscapes , Edenic , frightening , beautiful , beckoning , virgin and dangerous : the North American Unknown . During this section , the SOUND should convey the sensation that the weather is growing colder and colder . There is more wind , with an increasingly desolate and God-forsaken , God-wheedling keenness to it , a strength and terror , an uncaring and abyssmal quality . SHOT - BUCK sitting on deck looking and listening to all this , patientl and peacefully , as of a creature who recognizes something : yes , even of someone who is coming home . DISSOLVE TO : pp . NA-17 &nbsp; pp. 35-53 SHOT - DOCKED NARWHAL We come in on the confused scene of Dyea Beach , and PAN over the chaos of men , equipment , and dogs . We show a great many dogs , some in cages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dogs are moving restlessly , some are sniffing , some are whining or snarling . Everythin is confusion and action , and there is a sense of preparation for some event which will be , for both men and dogs , a taxing , dangerous and exciting occurrence . The men we see are boisterous with anticipation , and the dogs seem to catch some of this , and express it in their way . We should see a good many different kinds of dogs , enough to be assured that the Stranger , back in California , knew what he was talking about when he spoke of the variety of dogs in the Klondike .  --  35  --  SHOT - PERRAULT leading Buck , otherwise quite free , down the gangplank on a rope . SHOT - OTHER THREE DOGS being carried off-board in their cages . Snow is beginning to fall . Not heavy snow , but enough for the screen to be snow-filled , and for us to be able to see , through the flakes , Perrault and Buck standing together , waiting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very obvious , looking up at the sky from which this strange , cold stuff is coming . He tries to sniff an individual flake . He is obviously interested in it Then he feels the snow in his fur , and instinctively shakes it off . EXTREME CLOSEUP - GROUND Buck places his foot on the white substance . He draws the foot back , and we ZOOM to the single dog-foot mark . GO TO BLACK . FADE IN : ON BUCK tethered to a post , taking it all in quietly . Suddenly there is a terrible snarling dog-fight sound . We just show a brief glimpse of this , CUT BACK to Buck , and then show another SHORT SHOT of a fight between two dogs different from the first two . This sequence should be enough to establish the fact that fights between dogs go on all the time at Dyea Beach and are to be expected . ANOTHER ANGLE in which Buck and Curly , one of the dogs he has been shipped North with , lying in f.g . Buck is calm and dog-thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets up and tries to be friendly , sniffing around one of the other dogs . Without warning the other dog , a bristling HUSKY , leaps into the friendly Curly . The Husky leaps away , and we COME IN CLOSE on Curly 's face , which is ripped-open and ghastly with injury-blood.  --  36  --  Curly leaps at the Husky , and is knocked flat . We see , then , in a horrifying scene of mass savagery , other dogs gather around the combatants in a kind of rough taut oddly symmetrical circle . We see Buck join the circle , and then sit calmly and watch . SHOT - BUCK looking at the huge Spitzbergen dog , Spitz , who is running his tongue over his lips . He turns to look squarely at Buck , and snarls but does nothing . All this is punctuated with the fearful yells of Curly and the death-dealing snarls of the Husky . We PULL THE SHOT BACK , and we watch as the most awful thing in the animal kingdom occurs . The ring of dogs , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curley , and we see nothing but the bristling mass of dog bodies , finishing her off . It is a moment of pure savagery , the non-survival of the unfittest : the call of the wild indeed . We see one of the dogs , wild with blood-lust and blood-shedding without retaliation , as a club strikes him . We PULL BACK the SHOT to show Francois , swinging a club  --  or , better still , an ax  --  in the midst of the death-dealing dogs , getting them separated , with the help of three other men swinging clubs . The dogs reluctantly disperse , with much reluctant ill-humor . The men mutter and curse confusedly . CONTINUE PULL BACK to LONG SHOT of the prostrate Curly , alone , stone dead . SHOT - BUCK going calmly back to the spot where he and Curly had previously lain . CLOSEUP - BUCK as he sits thinking . CLOSEUP - SPITZ again running his tongue over his lips . He growls slightly . CLOSEUP - BUCK who growls a little in return . We are setting up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all recorded time .  --  37  --  BRIEF NIGHT SHOT - BUCK in the dirty , trampled snow . TWO SHOT - FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT sitting on the canvas of struck tents . It is early morning They are talking earnestly , but we do n't yet know what they are saying . SHOT - SPITZ AND BUCK about six feet apart , perfectly still , like statues of dogs , their breath white in the air . &nbsp; PERRAULT ( v.o . ) Dat Blue-eye better leave Spitz alone . Dat Spitz , he had a t'ousand dog-fights. ( pause ) He here , wid us. ( pause ) All de odders  --  dead . Dey dead in Greenland . Dey dead in de Barrens . &nbsp; FRANCOISDat big California dog , he gon ' be dead in Alaska , he don ' watch out . SHOT - TWO DOGS still watching each other , motionless . There is the faint sound of a growl , though it is not clear which dog it comes from . TWO SHOT - FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT Perrault rolls and packs a snowball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the side , and seems to break the spell . The two dogs go opposite ways . The two men get back into their conversation . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( with a distant look in his eyes ) Dere was a miner , two , t'ree year back , I talk to heem , jus ' a leetle , in Dawson . He been to a place , name Two Cabin .  --  38  --  ( reverent pause ) He strike . ( pause ) Nobody believe he get to Two Cabin . Moi , I believe . He got de gold . He come back wid two dog . He start wid twenty-five . He had to eat de odders . He come into Dawson , he ca n't say nodden but Two Cabin , Two Cabin . ( pause ) He crazy : maybe de cold , maybe de dog-meat ... I don ' know .

Some of the odders say he stole de gold from miners near de Chilcoot , an ' keel dem . ( pause ) Moi , I t'ink he strike . ( pause ) He strike at Two Cabin . SHOT - PERRAULT obviously drawn into the plan very deeply . &nbsp; PERRAULTWhere ... where theese Two Cabin ? How we get dere ? How long it take ? TWO SHOT - MEN &nbsp; FRANCOISEet take seex week , if weather good . If weather no good ... ( he shrugs ) ... it take longer . &nbsp; PERRAULTSeex week ? Mon Dieu ! We gon ' be eatin ' our dogs !  --  39  --  &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( with conviction ) No , dat man 's dogs not good as ours . We got good team , good lead dog . We make it . ( pause ) And we get de gold . All de gold in de world . We gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anywhere we like . Anywhere . ( he laughs ) We go all de way to Paree t'ru Two Cabin . &nbsp; PERRAULTHow we get dere ? SHOT - SNOW amidst which the men sit . INTO FRAME comes the mittened hand of Francois , tracing out a rude map with his forefinger . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o . ) We go all de way up thees canyon ... SHOT - CANYON where they are . Snow is beginning to fall , and the prospect looks desolate indeed . The canyon fades slowly and softly out as the snowfall increases . BACK TO FRANCOIS ' SNOW-MAP which , as he traces out each element of the design , is already being effaced by the flakes . Francois ' finger keeps sketching , and we hear his VOICE say : &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o . ) We go up pas ' Sheep Camp ... SHOT - LANDSCAPE with frozen Creek , utterly desolate . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o. ) ... den t'ru de Scales ...  --  40  --  SHOT - LOW MOUNTAINS and we hear the wind . SNOW-MAP AND FINGER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Glacier ... SHOT - GLACIER a huge flow of ice that glows like frozen sperm , and , unexpectedly , we hear the terrifying sound of massive ice-movement : a groaning and breaking sound , something inhuman and human at once . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o. ) ( continuing ) We lucky , we make Jobe 's Glacier in a day ... ( pause ) And den ... and den the Chilcoot . SHOT taken from the Documentary City of Gold , of the prospective miners in their thousands going up and over the Chilcoot Pass . BRIEF SHOT finger in snow . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o . ) ... Den we go up de Chain-lakes ... on over to Lake Bennett , where dey found Big Mike Eau Claire 's body las ' year ... den on by Pierre Noir Volcano ... SHOT - BLACK VOLCANIC CRAG The wind whistling . TWO SHOT - MEN once more . &nbsp; FRANCOISWe get by Pierre Noir , we be in Two Cabin in six week .  --  41  --  Section Details EARLY DAY SHOT Francois is buckling Buck into the sled-team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he does not know exactly what is going on . VARIOUS SHOTS the sled-harness being fastened on him , a PAN over the rest of the team and the sled . Spitz is lead dog , and this should be shown as a very obvious fact . Brief sequence showing Buck lurching about a bit clumsily , from sheer inexperience . Francois ' whip cracks over him a couple of times , and then , as we show it from Francois ' position both beside and on the sled , Buck does better . SHOT - FRANCOIS shouting the traditional dog-sled commands . &nbsp; FRANCOISHo ! SHOT - TEAM halting , all except Buck . The whip cracks . SHOT - FRANCOIS over the sled now filled with wood , saying " Mush . " The team pulls forward , pulling Buck and the wood and Francois with it . TWO SHOT - FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT &nbsp; FRANCOIST'ree vair good dogs . Dat California dog , I tich heem quick as anything . ANOTHER ANGLE where Francois and Perrault are getting everything ready to set out in earnest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head as lead dog , Buck fairly far back of the leaders . We stress again , by what we show , the variety of dog-breeds.  --  42  --  As we show the dogs , we hear o.s. either Perrault or Francois talking about each one . &nbsp; VOICEWe got some we know pretty good , an ' some we do n't know . He good lead dog ... ( as we show Spitz ; then various other dogs , and we hear ) ... He do n't like to fight ... ( another ) ... He pull good , but he get tired easy ... ( another ) ... Heem eat too much ... but Spitz ... Startlingly SWIFT PAN to Spitz at the head of the team , looking backwards over the other dogs , looking wary and very authoritative . &nbsp; VOICE ... not let heem do it . We PAN , along the team , to Buck , eager to go , to find what is coming next . &nbsp; VOICE OVERThees one , he gon na be king of the ice and snow . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OVEREef the odders do n't keel heem . &nbsp; FIRST VOICEThees blue-eye garcon , he gon na take a lot of keeling . &nbsp; SECOND VOICESpitz do n't like heem . SPITZ - QUICK CUT He is still alert , and waiting either to pull or fight , to maintain authority by force or to battle because his position is threatened , or for food , or for sheer personal enmity . CLOSEUP - BUCK whining , wanting to get on with it .  --  43  --  &nbsp; FIRST VOICEThees California blue-eye , you wait till he learn . Learn ever't'ing he got to know . Then you see someding . Spitz better leave heem alone . &nbsp; SECOND VOICEWe find out . We PULL BACK THE SHOT to show the team and the men setting out . We should use a rear tracking shot here , and let the outfit diminish into the snow , which is beginning to fall harder and harder . SHOT - TEAM AND MEN clearing the head of the canyon . SHOT - TEAM standing in place in the traces , resting . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a cup and breathing on it , to make drinking-water . He breathes and breathes whitely , then drinks from the cup with great relief . TWO SHOT - MEN Perrault just having finished drinking . &nbsp; PERRAULTMus ' never eat de snow . I seen you eat de snow . Eet drive you mad . Mus ' melt it down . Den , de greates ' water in de world . Eet more pure dan rain . ( he offers cup ) Francois takes cup and drinks , with utmost satisfaction . SHOT - BUCK in the traces . The other dogs are lying down , but Buck is standing .  --  44  --  SHOT - MEN &nbsp; FRANCOISHey , Beeg Boy , thees no like Californie , eh ? ( pause ) You do better here . We get Two Cabin , me and Perrault buy you gold collar . ( pause ) We get Two Cabin ... and back to Dawson . FADE OUT . FADE IN : Section Details NIGHT SHOT - CAMP There are a couple of tents , inside of one of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tent . The shadows of two men are framed against it . SHOT - BUCK wandering disconsolately about . The other dogs seem to have disappeared , and he quite literally does n't know what the hell to do . He is tired and wants to sleep . INT . TENT Francois and Perrault are eating and drinking coffee ( or something ) from battered tin mugs . SHOT - TWO MEN bombarding Buck , who has tried to invade the tent , with curses and cooking utensils . SHOT - BUCK getting out fast . ANOTHER ANGIE - BUCK wandering around the camp , even more confused than before .  --  45  --  CLOSEUP - BUCK wandering the camp . Suddenly the snow beneath his feet , as solid , seemingly , as that he had been walking on , gives way . There is a muffled yelp . Buck has accidentally stepped on the snow-nest of another dog . He leaps away , then comes back sniffing . CLOSEUP - OTHER DOG 'S MUZZLE coming up out of the white hole . It makes a tentative lick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking around for a place to do the same thing , sleep-wise , as the other dog is doing . VARIOUS CUTS of him searching this way and that , and then the selection of a sleep-site . CLOSEUP - BUCK digging , rather awkwardly , at the snow . All the time he does this he is coming to be covered with more and more flakes from the air . Finally he gets his hole dug , and we PULL IN even farther in the CLOSEUP to show Buck snuggling down into the hole , and the falling flakes snowing him in . At length there is no evidence left to show that a dog was ever there . As we PAN over the places where the snow-sleeping dogs are lying , we hear , almost infinitely far away , the HOWL of something that might be a wolf : a single howl : a sound that might also be the wind , but not quite the same as if it were . Not quite . EXTREME CLOSEUP - BUCK in his self-dug womb of crystals . He opens his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head as though he does n't know where he is , as indeed he does n't . SHOT - JUST ABOVE BUCK 'S HOLE and we see Buck bound straight up out of the snow , like a huge dog exploding into being from another world we never knew was there : from the invisible , from Heaven or Hell or eternity . We might consider filming this dog-snow explosion in SLOW MOTION , and FREEZE FRAME it exactly at the moment when Buck 's feet hit the ground . Or the snow , rather .  --  46  --  BRIEF SHOT at a halt , of Perrault changing Buck 's position on the team , moving him forward . &nbsp; PERRAULT ( gesturing toward the dogs he names ) We put him in between Dave and Sol-leks . He learn faster there . VERY FAST SUCCESSION OF SHOTS ON THE TRAIL going up hills and down , across frozen lakes . Sometimes it is snowing , sometimes we are in the white silence , the burning daylight . VARIOUS SHOTS - BUCK learning his trade as part of a dog-sled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heels . SHOTS of Francois or Perrault cracking the whip over him . BRIEF CUT - STALLED TEAM where Buck has messed up the traces . Several dogs , experienced ones , set on him . SHOT - PERRAULT over growling dogs . Then we COME IN over Buck . &nbsp; PERRAULTWe do n't get the traces mixed up no more . Eh , Blue-eyes , my big California friend ! Eh ? TWILIGHT SHOT - PERRAULT examining Buck 's feet after the trail . The man squints shrewdly , turning the paw this way and that . Buck whimpers ; it has been a hard day . Perrault pats Buck 's big head . Buck responds , limitedly . He still does not know quite what to expect from any of this . But he is learning . ANOTHER ANGLE The team 's running past various spectacular mountains and frozen rivers , going at a slow , easy , loping pace that it would be awfully hard to keep up all day . It passes the timberline , glaciers , snowdrifts.  --  47  --  MED . SHOT - DOG-TEAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much white breath in the strenuous air ; breath both of men and dogs . But what I wish to convey , in this terribly difficult climb , is the urgent necessity , in animals and men , to get there . But where ? No matter : the animal-human thing has been set in motion , amidst the snow . All are now committed . SHOTS - THE TEAM running along a chain of lakes , and a BRIEF SHOT of what might be an extinct volcano , weird and blackened in the half-light . The men are on snow-shoes and the team is pulling hard . SHOT - TEAM AND MEN going past Lake Bennett , passing dozens of men building boats for the time when the spring thaw will come . SHOT - FRANCOIS This time riding on the heel of the sled . &nbsp; FRANCOISWe all get the t'aw soon . Seex week , she do it . TWILIGHT SHOT dogs being fed . In what I think should be kind of a funny sequence , another dog steals from Buck 's dish . We CUT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two men roar with laughter . BRIEF SHOTS - BUCK biting the ice from between his toes at the end of a day 's run , and , again , of his breaking the scum of ice from a water-hole by pouncing on it with his forelegs , in the manner of a creature trying to squash something , either living or inanimate . LONG SHOT - SHEEP CAMP and the frozen creek . BUCK sniffing the air and whining , a little restive .  --  48  --  SHOT - LOW - SNOW-COVERED HILLS - THE SCALES Buck is pulling hard , but he is looking around at all sides , not violently , but , if we can show it , a certain growing conviction , a certain interest he is not sure of , but which is definitely there , is taking hold of him . SHOT - CAMP at foot of glacier , an awesome spot indeed . Suddenly there is the groaning of ice . The other dogs whine a little , lying , undone from the traces , in the snow . Buck does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . Sound dies away . There is dead silence . SHOT - BUCK lying in the snow with the other dogs . Suddenly , without any warning whatever , he leaps to his feet , turning his head this way and that . A low growl comes from his throat , and then what could be the beginnings of a howl . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o . ) Hey , Californie , lay down . What wrong weeth you ? We got a long way to go tomorrow . Forty mile , we got to make . SHOT - TEAM AND MEN toiling over Chilcoot Pass . In contrast to previous photograph from City of Gold , there are only a few men and teams here , and it is snowing bitterly . SHOT - SPITZ toiling , bringing the team along , pulling them up to the crest of the Pass . SHOT - BUCK pulling like hell , pulling his weight  --  and more  --  on the team , getting them to Two Cabin , to some unknown destination where there may be gold . May be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f.g. , the men and team seem tiny indeed ; creatures on the day that God invented snow , and could n't have enough of it .

Gold sheets ! Gold everything ! Francois kisses his hand to the volcano , in the French way . BRIEF SHOT - MEN AND BUCK at fire . Buck is peering intently into the flames . SHOT - PERRAULT AND FRANCOIS the flame-shadows flickering on their faces . &nbsp; PERRAULT ( gesturing toward Buck , who is stretched out and alert ) He love de fire . He like get warm . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( after long pause ) No . Eet is more dan dat . SHOT - BUCK as he raises his head from the snow , from the fire , and looks around in a strangely knowing way . We COME IN CLOSE ON Buck 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking not into the fire , but into the vast Arctic night itself , and listening . PULL BACK to show Buck , settling into his fire-looking position again , relaxed and inscrutable , gazing into the flames . DISSOLVE TO :  --  50  --  DAY SHOT - MEN AND DOG-TEAM The snow has stopped , and the dogs are working hard , and the men as well . It is rough country .

Dis too hard . SHOT - FRANCOIS &nbsp; FRANCOISWe get dere . We got to get dere . SHOT - DOGS They are beginning to flounder . One of them falls down . He gets up immediately , but then another one falls . He also gets up , but more slowly than the first . SHOT - SPITZ looking back over his shoulder as if irritated at the weakness of the dogs that are failing him . SHOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buck is not giving away an inch to Spitz . SHOT - SPITZ PULLING HARD SHOT - BUCK PULLING HARD TWILIGHT SHOT : MEN MAKING CAMP This location should be different from the others : it should have some kind of distinctive character .  --  51  --  Perhaps it is against the side of a hill , or among thick trees or bushes . We must always vary the camp-sites , so as to show the movement through the wilderness , the differences in place . SHOT - TEAM-DOGS roaming restlessly around the camp-site , each seeking that mysterious spot in which to lie down : that spot known only to dogs . SHOT - SPITZ who finally lies down and curls up upon himself in the snow . SHOT - BUCK looking undetermined as yet . But he is a magnificent figure , against the trees and the snow . We COME IN on him very slowly , as he stands there . We want two things to register here : the sense of his magnificent animality coupled with the wild place he is in , thousands of miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . He lifts his head from the snow , a kind of dreaming beast , and pauses briefly , as if hearing something . Then he lies down . The other dogs are still ; do n't move . TWO SHOT - FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT lying on tent-canvas with what looks like buffalo robes over them . A little snow filters down on them . &nbsp; PERRAULT ( raising up on an elbow ) Dat Californie Blue-eye , he doin ' some good work , eh ? &nbsp; FRANCOISHe good . He might ' good . He got good fast . He smart and strong . He make a man a million dollar ' . De right man .  --  52  --  &nbsp; PERRAULTYou de right man , Francois ? ( pause ) Is we de right man ? &nbsp; FRANCOISI don ' know .

Spitz keel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAWN SHOT - PERRAULT sitting in the snow in mukluks , cutting apart another set of mukluks , and meticulously setting the squares of leather or hide that he obtains from the process , beside him . TWO SHOT - BUCK AND PERRAULT who is making an improvised set of moccasins for Buck out of the remains of his own footgear . BRIEF SCENE - HARNESSING DOGS One of them acts strangely , and begins to slaver white froth . Suddenly this dog , just before being harnessed into the traces , gives a terrifying howl , straightens up , and leaps away , running aimlessly . Buck , has never seen a dog go mad before . But this one is mad , and therefore terribly dangerous . The dog , DOLLY , then about thirty yards from the men seems to conceive some plan of action in her madness . HAND OF FRANCOIS deliberately picking up an ax . &nbsp; DOLLYcharging madly on the men .  --  53  --  &nbsp; FRANCOISbringing down the ax with all his might . CLOSEUP - DOLLY lying dead , with blood seeping into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 18-34 &nbsp; pp. 54-71 LATE AFTERNOON SHOT in another place , the edge of a fir forest . The dogs are bickering amongst themselves . CLOSUE - SPITZ snarling , and to another of Buck , also snarling aggressively TWO SHOT - FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT &nbsp; FRANCOISThey go'n fight . Dat blue-eye Californie , him want to be lead dog . Spitz don ' lak dat . &nbsp; PERRAULTDey go'n fight all right , but not here . Later . Dey go'n fight , and there ai n't g'on but one of ' em go'n live . &nbsp; FRANCOISSpitz will keel him . &nbsp; PERRAULT ( quietly ) No he wo n't . SLOW DISSOLVE TO : A QUIET , UNEARTHLY QUIET SCENE It is the white silence , complete and serenely uncaring . But there is something within it that moves within this CLOSEUP . We FOCUS gradually , and finally we make out a snowshoe rabbit , perfectly camouflaged except for the eyes , which we show in an EXTREME CLOSEUP . Suddenly , o.s. , there is a dog growl . The rabbit leaps o.s.  --  54 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole pack of sled-dogs is after the rabbit , led by Buck . The rabbit turns and veers , the dogs bay and follow , floundering in the snow . There is now a fairly rapid sequence of the chase . We see Buck and the twenty-off other dogs unable to gain , and the rabbit holding his own . We then MOVE THE CAMERA off the rabbit and bade into the pack , and see Spitz stop , apparently abandoned but also thinking , and then set out in an oblique direction . MED . SHOT - STRAINING - FLOUNDERING PACK SLOW PAN over the snow , perhaps over a frozen creek-bed , and we come in on Spitz sitting with the dead rabbit between his forepaws , sniffing it , and then looking up , like one in possession . SHOT - BUCK at the head of the pack . The pack stops short , but Buck does not . From his chase-run he launches himself straight over the rabbit onto Spitz , and knocks him over . Then there is a terrible confusion , and we , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing fangs , flurries and parries in mid-air . And yet we also try to show that these dogs are not in a blind fury as to which shall have the rabbit . If we can possibly get the effect that Jack London wanted , we should show the fight as a battle for mastery , and the two combatants as being as wary as heavyweight boxers . We show VARIOUS SHOTS of them circling each other , looking for an opening . Once Buck is cut near his neck-line , and we show the blood in a CLOSEUP . CLOSEUP SHOT of both dogs rolling over and over in the snow . The rabbit is forgotten . SHOT - OTHER DOGS forming their fearful circle . One of them licks his lips . ANOTHER SHOT fighting dogs on ground . Buck is down , with Spitz on top .  --  55  --  TWO SHOT - FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT who have come up . &nbsp; FRANCOISWhat I say ? Speetz keel him . &nbsp; PERRAULTNo . I stop thees . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( putting out a restraining hand ) Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bot ' dem big devils come at you two ways , ai n't no ax-handle gon na help you . How I gon na get to Two Cabin wit ' no pardner ? No , you stay away from dose two devils . BUCK In vain he strives to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog . Buck can not penetrate Spitz ' guard . He rushes many times and is slashed for his effort , with Spitz dancing away . ANOTHER ANGLE - BUCK He now employs a different tactic . Rushing , but suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side to drive his shoulder at the shoulder of Spitz . Buck 's shoulder is ripped each time , as Spitz leaps lightly away . SPITZ He is untouched . BUCK He is streaming blood and panting hard . SILENT AND WOLFISH CIRCLE OF DOGS BUCK being thrown over .  --  56  --  CIRCLE OF DOGS starting to rise . BUCK recovering almost in mid-air . CIRCLE OF DOGS sinking down again to wait . ANOTHER SHOT - BUCK AND SPITZ circling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is winded and staggering . He rushes again as though attempting the shoulder trick , but at the last instant he sweeps low and in . CLOSE SHOT - BUCK 'S TEETH close on Spitz ' foreleg . There is a crunching sound of breaking bone . SILENT CIRCLE OF DOGS eyes gleaming , tongues lolling , silvery breaths drifting upwards , edging closer . SHOT - SPITZ staggering horribly and growling . There is no hope for Spitz . Buck is inexorable . Mercy is a thing reserved for gentler climes . He maneuvers for the final rush , the dog circle tightens and Buck can see them , beyond Spitz and to either side , half crouching for the spring . There is a pause , as every animal is motionless at this final moment . Only Spitz is quivering , snarling with horrible menace , as though to frighten off impending death . BUCK 'S POV as he maneuvers for final rush . Spitz is bristling and staggering and staggering back and forth . The circle seems tighter .  --  57  --  SHOT MAYBE SLOW MOTION of Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck 's body soars over the CAMERA . CUT TO : SILENT CIRCLE OF DOGS Their white breath floating up , some of their tongues out . There is a terrible growling-and-tearing sound off-screen . CUT TO : SHOT - BUCK backing away from the fallen Spitz , and of the unrelenting circle of dogs closing in . CUT TO : BUCK licking himself . CUT TO : DOGS over Spitz ' body , as it is becoming obscured by the bodies of the rest of the pack . CUT TO : BUCK He stands , looking on , the successful champion , the dominant primordial beast who has made his kill and found it good . We LIFT THE CAMERA to show the aurora borealis above the scene , and FADE OUT . ( Another opportunity for a commercial break. )  --  58  --  Section Details SCENE - SAME CAMP - TWILIGHT when men and dogs are tired , and consequently there is a strong , tender feeling of affection and mutual dependence on each other . The scene is of the men making camp . One of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up camp . Francois is discovered standing center CAMERA . Then , in a certain tired , affectionate , half-dreaming way , he slogs through the snow among the dogs , speaking to each in turn . This monologue is a form of poetry , and should sound like it . It will never be written down , or heard by anyone but a man and twenty dogs . But it is taking place . ANGLE We go over each dog , very SLOWLY photographed . The dogs are lying patiently ; some of the tongues are out . They do not look belligerent ; only obedient and tired . CLOSEUP - SOL-LEKS as lead dog , lying down . He is panting gently . Mittened hand comes into FRAME . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o. ) ( as hand caresses tough head of Sol-leks ) You doin ' good , old Sol-leks. ( pause ) Somebody tell me your name mean De Angry One . I don ' know de language . ( pause ) You might ' a been mad wid somebody else , but you ain ' never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Francois looks out over the frozen landscape , and says , musingly , and with a certain amount of wonder : &nbsp; FRANCOISDat Spitz ... he sleepin ' far out tonight . Blue-eye keel heem good ... ( a beat ) I never thought any dog keel Spitz . But this Californie dog , he make up his mind he weel be king . &nbsp; PERRAULTMaybe Spitz he better off out there . He don ' have to go no further . But we gon ' lose time wid new lead dog .  --  59  --  SLOW PAN DOWN LINE OF DOGS CAMERA at some times MOVING DOWN one line of double-teamed dogs , and then crossing over to focus on a dog in the other line , as mittened hands undo him from the traces . And all the time this is being done , we HEAR the voice of Francois talking in low tones to each dog , characterizing him with affection and honor , but fully aware of weaknesses and foibles . SHOT - ONE-EYED DOG &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o . ) Eh , my old One-eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odder dog comin ' at you from you ' blin ' side , eh ? ( pause ) Dey don ' mess wid you . Blin ' side , good side , dey better not mess wid you , my old One-eye . PAN DOWN THE LINE SOME MORE What should be evident from this scene is the astonishing variety of dog-breeds . There are Newfoundlands , Saint Bernards , dogs that look like wolves , even an Irish setter . CLOSEUP - IRISH SETTER &nbsp; FRANCOISNo , Little Red , you no like to fight . You little . You try hard , up in this damn snow . You all right . But you little . ( pause ) We get dere . We get to Two Cabin .

TWO SHOT - FRANCOIS releasing the Newfoundland from the traces , with the utmost love . &nbsp; FRANCOISBut we love you , you no-good. ( pause ) We get you somedin ' to eat , no matter what we have t ' do . PAN DOWN THE LINE OF DOGS and suddenly we come to rest on Buck . He is lying in the traces , patient and apparently calculating . But he is peaceful . SHOT OF DAVE opposite to Buck in traces . Dave is panting heavily , even though the team is at rest . With a gesture of extreme tenderness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his right hand , and the bare hand go to Dave 's head . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o . ) You gettin ' old , my old Davy .

SHOT OF DAVE who is getting up , but almost immediately lies down . PAN SLOWLY again to Buck , and we come in once more on the blue , the startlingly blue eyes . SHOT OF PERRAULT chopping wood , and we hear his grunts and see his breath . &nbsp; PERRAULT ( v.o. ) ( as from limbo ; an Arctic limbo ) Sacre Bleu , thees wood hard to chop .

We see the men working around camp , and we HEAR , v.o. , a dialogue between Perrault and Francois , just the voices , as the scenes of camp work take place . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o . ) Eh , Perrault , what we do here , uh ?

SHOT - SLED-TRACES ONCE MORE A moonlit shadow comes over the place of the lead dog . We come in intensely on this , emphasizing the head and the ears of the shadow . It is Buck .  --  63  --  SHOT OF BUCK lying down in the lead dog 's spot . It is moonlight . There is no pulling to be done yet . The dog lies in the moon , in the traces of the lead dog .

REAR SHOT OF THE REST OF THE DOG-TEAM ready to go , but with one conspicuously empty place ; the position formerly occupied by Buck .

SHOT OF PERRAULT now entering into the chase , and we show a succession of shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always just out of range . They ca n't get to Buck by any means . He knows this , and finally they know it .  --  64  --  SHOT OF PERRAULT in a kind of comic exhaustion , as though depicting , what the hell are we going to do in this situation , with this dog ? SHOT OF FRANCOIS pulling a big , old-fashioned gold watch out of his pants and looking at it in frustrated consternation . &nbsp; FRANCOISWe ought ' be on de trail one hour ago . One hour an ' half . Perrault goes to the head of the team , unfastens the designated lead-dog , muscles him back to Buck 's old spot , and fastens him into the traces .

SEVERAL SHOTS OF BUCK leading the team . Things look good . The weather is fair , the whole operation seems to be doing extremely well . The scenery  --  depending on what locations we as film-makers decide to use  --  is unexceptionally various and lovely , in the far-north way . One man rides on the sled and the other runs behind , and we show that they take turns at each position .  --  65  --  SHOT one of the men running behind the sled . Buck is leading the team so well that the man can hardly keep up , and has to hold to the sled by a rope . Even then , as they go down a slope , he ca n't keep up , and sprawls headlong . The other man looks back from the heel of the sled , laughing . It is Perrault . &nbsp; PERRAULT ( gesturing toward head of team ) Heh , Francois ! Thees new top dog too much dog for you , eh ? SHOT OF FRANCOIS rising from the snow and resuming his hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both men are being good-natured ; this is fun . But now the landscape darkens . The Spring that had seemed so close at hand was not to be  --  not yet . The temperature dropped rapidly and the elements began to show their extremes . We show that there is a terrible and biting cold . The men are bearded , and we CUT to show them breaking out parkas , and putting them on over their other parkas . TWO SHOT - FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT &nbsp; PERRAULT ( running his hand delicately over the fringes of his outside parka ) Wolverine fur . Cost a lot . But you can brush de ice right off . CLOSEUP , coming into the CAMERA . LONG SHOT - TEAM AND MEN going across frozen lakes , at a reasonable clip , one man on the sled-heel , the other running behind .

And with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but great silences pass between words . Their light heartedness is gone , given way to exhaustion and depression . DISSOLVE TO : LATE AFTERNOON SHOT the two Frenchmen and their sled team making their difficult way through heavy , freshly fallen snow . Both men and dogs sink into the snow deeply . Their progress is extremely slow . We see men and dogs stumble . DISSOLVE TO : EXTREMELY GRAY DAY accompanied by a fearful wind . We must strive to show that the temperature has fallen to an incredible fifty degrees below zero . The Frenchmen are leaning into the wind , bundled in parkas and any other clothes they can fit on . SHOT - BUCK IN THE F.G . but showing the other dogs as well , straining against the wind , eyes practically closed against wind and sleet . As we watch the sled team we see that it takes enormous effort to cover what must be only a hundred yards . CLOSE SHOT - PERRAULT at the heel of the sled . He is gasping for breath . His bearded face shows signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is Francois . He is farther back from the sled than we have yet seen . DISSOLVE TO : SHOT OF THE TEAM with one empty trace . SHOT OF DOG - DAVE who can barely make it even to get on his feet . We see him stumble and try to get into the traces , but he keeps falling , and almost-recovering but not , and falling again . It is obvious that he ca n't pull any longer . He will have to be left behind .  --  67  --  SHOT OF EMPTY TRACES WHERE DAVE BELONGS SHOT OF DAVE trying to get there . He just barely reaches the traces , and nuzzles them , pathetically attempting to get his head into the leather . SHOT OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT &nbsp; PERRAULTHe try .

BLAZING-NOON SITUATION The snow is coming back at the men with burning daylight and cold , and arctic sun that freezes you and burns you up at the same time . &nbsp; PERRAULTWe can not make it , Francois .

W'at about dem ?  --  69  --  SHOT - DOG-TEAM They are all terribly foot-sore , no spring or rebound left in them . There is actually nothing the matter with them except that they are dead tired . It is not the dead-tiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort , from which recovery is a matter of hours ; it is the dead-tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil . There is no power of recuperation left , no reserve strength to call upon . It has all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every muscle , every fibre , every cell is tired , dead tired . And there is reason for it .

At least for them . SHOT OF DOGS lying down in the traces , done-in , in the middle of the squalid , temporary town . One dog lifts his sore paw and licks it .  --  72  --  SHOT OF FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT talking to three people who are strange to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache , one is hardly more than a boy , one is a shrewish , suburban , get-rich-quick type . She is the wife of the weak man and the sister of the boy . We PAN over these three , who are to be Buck 's new owners . It is obvious that they are the greenest of greenhorns . Their quasi-flashy clothes are not fitted for the environment , neither place nor time , and they give the impression of playing with what they are doing in the Klondike , but in a vicious , unimaginative way . As we look at them , we note that the boy , HAL , has , strapped to his side , an outsized revolver , and a belt of bullets that could knock out the whole wretched village they 're all standing in . The three of them are so obviously out of place that their appearance should verge on the ludicrous . They are of the bad part of humanity that the lure of Klondike gold calls forth . These are of the worst , but not the cunning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PERRAULT ( gesturing toward the woman , MERCEDES ) You bes ' get her back to Dawson City . This ai n't no woman 's country . &nbsp; FRANCOISIt ain ' no man 's country , neither , ( pause ) Slight wind SOUND , through the wretched streets and shacks . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( o.s . ) It ain ' nobody 's country . It de devil 's . SHOT OF EXPANSE OF SNOW-FIELDS AROUND THE SHACKS &nbsp; VOICEDe Devil mighty big , up here . He dead-white. ( pause ) And he don ' care . DISSOLVE TO : THE FIVE OF THEM - TWILIGHT standing in the f.g . before the still-harnessed dog-team , talking in low voices . Money is passed from CHARLIE , the older of the other two men , to Perrault.  --  73  --  SHOT - UNLOADING SUPPLIES of Francois and Perrault and the loading of the stuff of Charlie , Hal and Mercedes . SHOT - BUCK 'S DOG-TEAM as the team rests in the snow . SNOW-LEVEL - BESIDE TEAM We FRAME SHOT so as to show Buck and two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into FRAME , and it is evident that he is kneeling in the snow , beside the dogs . FRANCOIS running his hand in a half-dreaming way over the head of Buck . Buck whines a little , and snuggles , for the last time of all , with the good Francois . &nbsp; FRANCOISGoodbye , ol ' blue-eye. ( pause ) You chop ' em up . ( pause ) You gon ' make somebody million dollar ... ( long pause ) DESOLATE SURROUNDINGS PAN OVER the lousy camp , the isolated region . &nbsp; FRANCOIS ( v.o . ) ... But not me . Not me . SHOT OF FRANCOIS going down the line of the dogs that are left . At one point in this segment , he is mysteriously joined by Perrault . This is all shot in the shadows , and has the sense , almost , of a religious rite . Francois and Perrault murmur , each individually , among the dogs , and behind the scene is the aurora borealis , hanging in the northern sky . We should low-key this scene , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much love .  --  74  --  BLASTING SCENE IN DAYLIGHT The strongest possible contrast to the tenderness of the goodbye scene between Buck and the other dogs and Francois and Perrault . The burning daylight on the snow is fierce , as we see : SHOT - THREESOME buckling dogs into team . Buck is lead dog , but he is tired , as the rest of the dogs are tired . SHOT - THE TEAM driving off under its new owners . BRIEF SHOT - FRANCOIS AND PERRAULT turning slowly and walking away , defeated by their struggle with the Klondike , but at least not dead . They will not be back . But , such is the gold-fever , maybe they will , like many another . VARIOUS SHOTS - THE NEW THREESOME driving the team . DISSOLVE TO : SHOT - THREESOME AND DOGS arriving into threesome 's camp . It is early morning . Brief PAN over camp , to show the slipshod and slovenly disarray , the tent half-stretched and ineptly handled , the dishes unwashed and piled higgledy-piggledy , everything in camp a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as by that of themselves , these people are not of the stuff to survive in the Yukon , much less find gold and get rich on it . They are just greedy , sorry folk , the men pugnacious and cowardly , the woman a nagging bore who should n't be in the Yukon in the first place . SHOT - THREE MEN from a neighboring camp coming over and offering advice .  --  75  --  He watches Charlie and Hal clumsily break down the tent and try to roll it up in a fitting position for the dog-sled to carry . &nbsp; FIRST MANI would n't tote that tent along if I was you . Too heavy . Takes up too much room . MERCEDES outraged by the idea that she should not have a tent . &nbsp; MERCEDES ( indignantly , with the low , advantage-taking meanness , masked as self-righteousness , of some of her sex ) I 'm a woman . Had n't you guessed that ? I want that tent , and I 'm gon na have it . DISSOLVE TO : SHOT OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sled , covered up to the eyeballs in furs , and both the men are on the sled-heel , though it is obvious that this is not the best way to do things . The people are just lazy , and the dogs are confused . These latter are used to working with at least some degree of expertise , and they whine uneasily , knowing that their present masters have little or none . SHOT - CHARLIE ON TAILGATE He uncurls whip . &nbsp; CHARLIECome on , Mush , you lazy bastards . FULL SHOT - TEAM The dogs spring against the breast-band , straining hard for a few moments , then relaxing . They are unable to move the sled.  --  76  --  CHARLIE &nbsp; CHARLIEThe lazy brutes , I 'll show them . He prepares to lash out with the whip . PAN TO FIRST MAN &nbsp; FIRST MANThey 're weak as water , if you want to know . They need a rest . SECOND MAN He shrugs . Obviously nothing can be done with these people . He has probably seen their like before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHIP as it falls upon the dogs . The team throws itself another time against the breast-bands , digging their feet into the packed snow , getting down low to it , and putting forth all its strength . The sled holds as though it were an anchor . The whip lashes out again , and with a third effort the runners break loose from the ice that held them . SHOT - WHIP CRACK The team starts confusedly and awkwardly to move . SHOT - CHARLIE frenziedly whipping , and of the team and sled rounding a curve in the trail . SHOT - WHOLE ENSEMBLE coming into CAMERA , and then of the sled tipping hilariously and frustratingly over , and all manner of goods , most of them not suited to the Arctic , spilling out on the snow , in the dim air . BRIEF SHOT - TRIO ON THE TRAIL There are continuous whipcracks , and Mercedes keeps crying out in a way that is characteristic of the city , and not of the wilderness . She is ill-bred , commonplace , and altogether out-of-place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONFUSED TEAM Buck at the head , doing its best , but under these circumstances , it is not a very good best . SHOT - BRIEF INTERLUDE BETWEEN DRIVES The men are trying to do something with the load on the sled . In the SHOT , we see Mercedes sitting a little way off from the men and the sled and the dogs , in her heavy furs , in the snow . We cut to her face in the parka . It is the face of a woman who can not imagine how she ever allowed herself to get into such a situation . In her expression there are elements of sorrow , frustration and a terrible fear . She looks dazed , and even half-mad , autistic . DISSOLVE TO : ONE MORE TRAIL SHOT and we see the frustration of the greenhorns again being taken out on the dogs . Much whip-cracking and cursing , on the part of the men . Much helpless weeping on the part of the fur-muffled Mercedes . SHOT - BUCK staggering at the head of the team , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whip and club drive him to his feet . CLOSE SHOT - BUCK All the stiffness and gloss has gone out of his beautiful furry coat . The hair hangs down , limp and draggled , and matted with blood in spots where Charles ' club has bruised him . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details SHOT - OVER THE TEAM - A KIND OF CAMP A typical placer-miner 's rig at the mouth of the White River . The day is dimming out into twilight . There does n't seem to be anybody around the camp . The team and the people and the dogs stop . There is silence . &nbsp; HAL ( the last light glinting on his bullet belt ) Well , just where the hell is everybody ?  --  78  --  I heard this man supposed to be here could tell you just about everything about the Klondike there is to know . Question is , why ai n't he rich ? &nbsp; CHARLIEI do n't care whether he 's rich or not . Just ... ( pause ) ... where the hell is he ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in the sled ) Charlie , you 've run ' em to death . They ca n't do no more . They got ta have something to eat . They got ta sleep , at least just a little bit . &nbsp; CHARLIEThe hell with ' em . We got to get across these goddamned lakes before the thaw . We 'll have a hell of a hard time getting to Dawson City if we do n't do it before the ice caves in . And that 's the truth . ( pause ) Where the hell is this goddamned guy ? CHARLIE AND HAL looking around this way , that way , every way . Nothing . SHOT - CHARLIE bringing his gaze back from the gathering obscurity of the Arctic twilight to the dog-team , and focusing his frustration upon it , and especially upon Buck , his lead dog . CLOSEUP - CHARLIE showing all his vicious , callow fury . &nbsp; CHARLIEYou , you son-of-a-bitch . If you'a kept this team in line , we'd'a been halfway to Dawson by now .  --  79  --  SHOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie reappears into FRAME , with a club in one hand and a whip in the other . It is obvious that he wants to kill him or get rid of him ; it does n't matter which . Buck does n't care . He is willing to let anything be done to him . He is so tired and footsore and hungry that , really , nothing matters anymore . CHARLIE beating and whipping Buck . HAL entering the beating scene . ANGLE Then , strangely , Mercedes pounces on the dog , bearing some kind of city-type female thing , like a slipper . Her fury is worse than the mens . &nbsp; MERCEDES ( as she strikes with the ultimate ill-bred viciousness ) God-damn you . Oh , God-DAMN you . LONG SHOT - FOREST It is not clear at first , but finally we see a figure there . It is far off among the twilit trees , but it becomes gradually distinct . It is a tall man , with his hat cocked at a broad-brimmed and unusual angle . We back-light this figure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the author , that the entrance of THORNTON must be extremely dramatic , and we must use any means at our command to make it so . I want the entrance of JOHN THORNTON to be characterized by the ultimates of mystery , menace , enigmatism and surprise . When we see him , we do n't know who he is , and above all , we do n't have any idea as to what kind of man he is . We have n't even seen his face yet . He is only a dim figure , off amongst the fir trees . ) SHOT - THE FIGURE OF WHAT WILL TURN OUT TO BE JOHN THORNTON advancing obliquely into the CAMERA , into what is left of the light of that particular day in the Klondike .  --  80  --  As he comes in closer , we see that he is wearing a heavy sheepherder 's type of coat , with the wool collar turned up . He has a barlow knife in his left hand , and a stick on which he has been whittling , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wood , and is in the reflecting snow . We come in on him , and we see who he is , what his face looks like , his clothes and the rest . SHOT - JOHN THORNTON concentrating on his whittling task , apparently paying very close attention to it , and apparently completely oblivious of what is being done to Buck . &nbsp; THORNTON ( without raising his eyes from his handwork ) You about through ? &nbsp; HAL ( desisting and coming over to Thornton , his gun-belt conspicuous ) Yeah , we 're about through with that big lazy sonofabitch. ( pause ) You 're Thornton . Right ? &nbsp; THORNTONRight enough . Charlie comes into the FRAME . &nbsp; CHARLIEWe want to get to Dawson by day after tomorrow . What 's the best way ? ( pause ) I mean , the quickest way . We do n't want to screw around . &nbsp; HALTwo trappers back yonder ... ( he gestures vaguely ) ... they told us the bottom was droppin ' out of the trail . ( pause ) They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little low-class pride ) They said we 'd never make it to White River . ( pause ) But here we are .  --  81  --  SHOT - THORNTON still whittling . &nbsp; THORNTONThey told you true . ( pause , and then with profound conviction ) The bottom 's goin ' to drop out any minute . It could be goin ' right now . SHOT - LAKE &nbsp; THORNTON ( v.o . ) That is rotten ice . Real rotten . ( pause ) Do n't mess with it . ( pause ) Believe me , do n't mess with it . Charlie comes into FRAME . &nbsp; CHARLIEYou say we can get to Dawson ' cross this lake ? THORNTON &nbsp; THORNTONYou could , if the ice holds . ( pause ) But this time ' a year , the ice ai n't gon na hold . There 's not no way it 's gon na hold . &nbsp; CHARLIENo . We do n't lay over . We go to Dawson . &nbsp; THORNTON ( resignedly ) All right . ( long pause ) You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He comes back into FRAME with compass , which glitters weirdly in the strange Northern light .  --  82  --  THORNTON as he examines compass . CLOSEUP - THORNTON as he holds compass this way and that , to the light . &nbsp; THORNTONYou want to go across the lake , right ? CHARLIE &nbsp; CHARLIERight . His breath weaves in the air . THORNTON still faceting the compass , as though he were holding a jewel to the light , examining its planes . &nbsp; THORNTONWhen you line out of here ... DESOLATE STRETCH OF SNOW-BOUND LAKE BACK TO THORNTON &nbsp; THORNTONYou pick up a course of two-seven-eight. ( pause ) Can you do that ? CLOSEUP - CHARLIE &nbsp; CHARLIEI can do it . In the b.g. , we HEAR Mercedes crying hysterically . &nbsp; THORNTONBut I would n't do it if I was you . ( pause ) It 's the wrong time .  --  83  --  ( pause ) It 's the wrong time of the year . ( pause ) You might make it . ( pause ) And you just might not . Dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; THORNTONAll right ! If you 're gon na go , you better go . ( he gestures with the flat of his right hand ) It just goes right straight across . SHOT - THE THREESOME preparing to leave . Mercedes trying to get on sled . CLOSEUP - BUCK lying on his side , about half in and half out of the circle of firelight that Thornton has caused to exist . As we see Buck , it is quite possible that he is dead . We see no sign of motion in him , no response , no sentience . SHOT - SLED-TEAM AND THE TRIO getting ready to start out . CLOSEUP - THORNTON who has resumed his whittling . He glances up , with a knowing expression on his face that nobody notes except the audience . HAL behind the sled . &nbsp; HALGet up there ! Hi ! Get up there ! Mush on !  --  84  --  TEAM OF DOGS - FAVORING BUCK which has not gotten up at the command . HAL lashing at the team with the whip . He is merciless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Another makes an effort , falling over twice . WIDER SHOT as Teek follows . Joe , Pike and others make painful attempts to get to their feet , yelping in their misery . Buck does not move . He is quiet where he has fallen . HAL making his way to Buck at the lead . HAL AND BUCK Buck is taking the whip again and again . CLOSE ON BUCK as the lash bites deeper and harder . THORNTON starting , as though to speak . A moisture coming into his eyes . Now he walks irresolutely , up and down . As Hal curses Buck , and continues to beat him with club and whip , we go to SLOW MOTION for a beat or two and then  --  CUT TO : BUCK 'S POV We HEAR Hal cursing , and the SOUND of the blows seems louder . But all we see is a haze of white , red , alternating with black , flickering of trees and snow , coming in and out of focus . We should do something unusual with the SOUND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating . From o.s. , with a cry more like that of an animal than a man , Thornton springs upon Hal . HAL being hurled backward as though struck by a falling tree . CLOSE SHOT - MERCEDES in the sled uttering a scream . THORNTON standing over Buck , struggling to control himself . &nbsp; THORNTONIf you strike that dog again , I 'll kill you . HAL down in the snow , wiping the blood from his mouth . &nbsp; HALHe 's my dog . Hal struggles to his feet . &nbsp; HALGet out of my way . I 'm going to Dawson . WIDER ANGLE showing Thornton standing between Hal and Buck . As Hal approaches he draws his long hunting knife . THORNTON who in a flash movement raps Hal 's knife from his hand with the stick on which he has been whittling . MERCEDES screaming and crying , on the verge of hysteria .  --  86  --  CLOSE SHOT - KNIFE on the ground with Hal making an attempt to retrieve it . Thornton 's heavy stick crashes onto Hal 's wrist again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own knife . &nbsp; THORNTONYou 're so anxious to go to Dawson . Get on with it ! CHARLIE moves as if to use the revolver that seems so ridiculous hanging on his hip . &nbsp; CHARLIENow just wait a Goddamned minute ! THORNTON whose eyes are dangerous . Still holding the stick he says : &nbsp; THORNTONI 'll break your arm before you can get that thing loose . CHARLIE who seems unwilling finally to prove the case one way or the other . &nbsp; CHARLIEAll right , keep him . He 's more dead than alive anyway . With the tension easing , Hal begins to rearrange the team , putting Pike in the lead with Sol-leks at the wheel position . CHARLIE There is no more fight left in him . Muttering beneath his breath , he , too , makes ready to move out . THORNTON expressionless , watching .  --  87  --  CLOSE SHOT - HAL &nbsp; HALMush ! Hi ! Move ! WIDEN the ANGLE to show Hal cracking the whip ; Mercedes , simpering , is aboard . Charles is bringing up the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggering and limping . BUCK who weakly raises his head at the SOUND of the team moving out  --  he watches as the group departs . SHOT - ILL-LADEN SLED AND CONFUSED DOGS setting off across the ice . COME IN ACROSS BUCK 'S PROSTRATE BODY and CONCENTRATE on a CLOSEUP of Thornton 's face . On it there is a peculiar mixture , in expressions , of worry and expectancy . DIM - LONG-DISTANCE TRACKING SHOT OF TRIO fairly far out on the frozen lake . CLOSE SHOT - BUCK who is watching his team disappear . THORNTON 'S FACE now registering horror . We faintly HEAR the cracking of ice , Mercedes ' scream , then silence . SHOT - FROZEN LAKE with , now , a yawning hole in it , where the sled and dogs and people have been . All are gone ; all are dead . &nbsp; THORNTON 'S VOICE ( o.s . ) God-damned fools . DISSOLVE TO :  --  88  --  SHOT OF BUCK IN F.G . as Thornton puts some more logs , unhurriedly , on the fire . The scene is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Buck , as Thornton kneels beside him . &nbsp; THORNTON ( gently feeling Buck 's side ) Let 's see here , big fellow . They busted you all up . ( he feels some more ) Them ribs all right ? ( he probes ) I 'll bet that 's sore , right there . Buck whines . &nbsp; THORNTONBut it do n't feel like nothin 's broke . ( pause ) Good . I think you 'll be all right . ( long pause ) It 'll take a while but I think you 'll make it . Buck lifts his head a little to look at Thornton . THORNTON - KNEELING OVER BUCK - AGAINST B.G. OF FIRE &nbsp; THORNTONYour name is Buck . ( pause ) I 'm a sonofabitch if it ai n't . DISSOLVE TO : pp. 54-71 &nbsp; pp. 89-115 SHOT - THE NEW SPRING All things are thawing , bending , snapping . The White River is straining to break loose the ice that bound it down . Air holes form , fissures spring and spread apart , while thin sections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few traces of snow . The CAMERA MOVES from familiar view of Thornton 's camp through a landscape of blooming flowers and leafing trees to the bank of the river . Here are Thornton and Buck lying on the river bank .  --  89  --  The weather is warm and Thornton wears no jacket . As we come CLOSER it is obvious that Buck is recovering rapidly . His flesh is healing and he no longer looks starved . As we come CLOSER still we see that Buck never takes his eyes from the man . DISSOLVE TO : SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK walking in the woods along the White River . Buck looks up at Thornton with adoration . Thornton is talking to Buck as they loaf through this Eden-like setting . DISSOLVE TO : THORNTON AND BUCK AT CAMP CLOSE on Buck who looks eagerly to Thornton . Thornton takes Buck 's head roughly in his hands , rests his own head on Buck 's and shakes him back and forth while calling him ill names , that to Buck are love names . THORNTON releasing Buck from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth laughing , his eyes eloquent , his throat vibrant with unuttered sound . In Buck 's heart there is ecstasy . CLOSE SHOT - THORNTON &nbsp; THORNTONGod , you can all but speak . DISSOLVE TO : NIGHT SHOT where in his cabin Thornton is mending a piece of leather harness . Buck , at Thornton 's feet , is alert , looking up into his face , dwelling upon it , studying it , following with keen interest every fleeting expression and movement . Buck 's gaze draws Thornton 's head around and he returns the gaze , the man 's heart shining out as does Buck 's . FADE OUT . FADE IN :  --  90  --  PANORAMIC SHOT OF SPRING ALASKAN LANDSCAPE The scene is almost like a far-Northern Eden , doubly beautiful because so short-lived . The yellow flowers are twice as delicate and twice as beautiful as if they were thriving in a lush Southern swamp . Their delicacy is of the moment , and precious therefore . O.s. there is a SOUND , and the CAMERA PANS up from the flowers to show Thornton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his condition from the expression on his face , but the nearest one can figure out is that he is running for his life . And yet , in the single CLOSEUP we give the audience of his face , there is in-mixed a very slight bit of sly fun . But the main look is of terror . SHOT - THORNTON running like hell , through the fields of Alpine yellow flowers . SHOT - BUCK bounding along after him , apparently bent on mayhem . Buck is growling , as it looks and sounds like , in utmost malice and death-pursuit . ANOTHER SHOT - THORNTON fleeing for his life , from Buck . But now Buck catches up with him and leaps on him as though pulling down an elk . Thornton falls among the spring flowers , and Buck is on top of him , going for the throat . VERY CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO OF THEM among the blossoms . Thornton is laughing madly , and Buck is still snarling , pretending to be a killer . It is obvious that this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the behind with an open hand , very hard , and Buck returns to the " attack " , and they continue to play very rough , but play , and of the most delightful kind it is  --  among the flowers of the Northern Eden . SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK Thornton , in wonderment , as he lies on his back with Buck panting over him . It is obvious that Buck wants to play some more .  --  91  --  He growls , and then goes once more , tentatively , at Thornton 's throat . Thornton still is laughing . Then we come in even CLOSER on Buck , and he performs what is evidently a kind of secret ceremony between the two of them . CLOSEUP - THORNTON 'S HAND lying amongst the flowers . The head of Buck comes into FRAME , and picks up the hand by the wrist . We HOLD on this SHOT , for it will figure strongly later , so it must register with great effect now . Buck shakes the hand playfully , with mock killing-rage . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in the warm Northern sun . Buck roams around a little , restlessly , and then settles into the flowers beside Thornton . SHOT - BUCK following Thornton with his eyes ; every movement of Thornton 's hands . SHOT - THORNTON making bread in a lonely camp-site . TWO SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK as Thornton finishes the sourdough-making . Thornton peels off a piece of the new bread , and throws it high in the air . Buck comes under it , and catches it in his mouth , fielding it like a champ . THORNTON who is delighted . &nbsp; THORNTONThat 's my big boy ! You do n't miss ' em . You ai n't never gon na miss ' em . NIGHT SHOT - THORNTON under buffalo robe . Buck 's head is lying on Thornton 's breast .  --  92  --  &nbsp; THORNTONAi n't you cold , boy ? ( pause ) Put that big old smart head up under this-here robe . Thornton puts Buck 's head under the robe under which he himself is preparing to sleep . Suddenly Buck rears up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . He sniffs , and then subsides . SOUND : There is a bare suggestion of the Call , or of something related to the wild , and not to men . SHOT - THORNTON lying on his stomach , looking at maps . Buck is right there with him . Thornton is looking at compass and at the same time at maps . DISSOLVE TO : REAR TRACKING SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK This time Thornton is not running all-out , but loping along like the traditional long-distance runner , tireless and looking good being so . Buck gambols about Thornton in the Yukon meadows . Perhaps he falls , deliberately , and rolls around , much like a puppy would do . Perhaps Thornton falls and does a somersault or two . It is all in great fun and abandonment . SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK coming back into Thornton 's camp , where they now greet Thornton 's two partners , WILL and STONY . These are two agreeable fellows , a little like hippie-types , but somewhat older than most hippies we see these days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough , but they laugh a good deal , and seem to look on the whole hard-working condition of the Yukon as something of a joke , a camaraderie from which they do n't hope for very much , but which just may very well surprise them , at any moment , at any location , at any turn of the spade or rinsing of the ore in the stream-pan . SHOT - WILL with long moustache and then to another of Stony , welcoming Thornton and Buck back from their romp . DISSOLVE TO :  --  93  --  ANGLE We are with Thornton and Stony and Will . The men are drinking , slowly and casually . We PAN past the men and Buck , to show a magnificent , panoramic wilderness-view , deadly and beautiful , with at least a five-hundred-foot fall from the place where the men and Buck are resting  --  the men drinking some unknowable beverage  --  and the twilight is coming , and beautiful it is , too . FOUR SHOT - THORNTON - WILL - STONY AND BUCK They are all taking it easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an unexpectedly delicate gesture , Buck 's head ) This dog , he 'd do anything in the world for you , John . &nbsp; THORNTONYou know , I think he would . Come here , boy . ( long pause , which we milk for all the drama we can get out of the scene ) You see that ? SHOT - ABYSS - EDGE OF THE CLIFF all the terrifying way down to the rocks . SHOT - THORNTON leaping upright . &nbsp; THORNTONJUMP , BUCK ! JUMP ! JUMP ! SLOW MOTION SHOT - BUCK going all-out toward the cliff . SHOT - STONY horrified . &nbsp; STONYNo ! NO ! My God , Thornton , NO !  --  94  --  SHOT - BUCK - STILL SLOW MOTION going full blast at cliff-edge . SLOW MOTION SHOT - THORNTON enveloping Buck in his arms in a kind of flying tackle , just at the very edge of the abyss . SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK lying , both panting heavily , at the edge of the cliff . TWO SHOT - WILL AND STONY &nbsp; STONY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( very matter-of-factly ) He was a-goin ' to do it ! SHOT OF LANDSCAPE which is desolate and beautiful . &nbsp; WILL ( v.o . ) This is a hellacious place , here . SOUND : Wind , wild and isolated . &nbsp; STONYMan got no chance . &nbsp; THORNTONMan got every chance in the world . Section Details SHOT - VAST PROSPECT - VISTA ON VISTA It is a beautiful view : beautiful and forbidding . But mainly beautiful and forbidding . SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK resting at the edge , the marvelous drop-off just beyond them , opening out endlessly . DISSOLVE TO :  --  95  --  NIGHT SHOT - EVENING MEAL between the three men , with Buck and the other dogs in the b.g . CLOSE IN on Thornton 's face . &nbsp; THORNTON ( musingly ) We got the weather , if it 'll just hold . ( pause ) I need about ten days . ( pause ) I 'll just take Buck and a gun and a few supplies . ( pause ) It shore ought not to take more than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men : &nbsp; THORNTONIf I ai n't back in two weeks , you 'll know I either got weathered in , someplace , or ... I ai n't gon na be back . &nbsp; WILLAw , come on now , John ... &nbsp; THORNTONWe 're taking a chance . I know it . But we  --  all of us  --  done come up here to take a chance . And if Buck and me can get to where I want to go , I know the stuff is there . ( long pause ) Bella Coola. ( pause ) That 's what you call a long , hard trail . ( pause , and with a brightening of attitude ) But we 've got the weather . Leastways we got it right now . SHOT - ENVIRONMENT OF CAMP the firelight , the mild wind , the dogs , the friendly , rough-cut men . Everything seems all right , out here in the Alaskan dark . FADE OUT . FADE IN :  --  96  --  SHOT - THORNTON outfitting Buck as a kind of miniature pack-horse . Buck 's pack-saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . Thornton is good at the outfitting , though ; he must have done it before . MED . SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK setting out across the flower-meadow that previously they had romped in . Buck is gamboling a bit , with his dog pack-saddle , and Thornton is walking sturdily along , with just a hint of jauntiness . CLOSEUP - THORNTON striding along , through the flowers , already indulging in what is to be his habit of talking to Buck as though the dog were a human being , and a particularly understanding one . &nbsp; THORNTONYou know , I do n't ask much , Buck . But I ai n't scared of all this territory up here . Thornton stops , and Buck also obediently stops . PAN over meadows , forests , mountains , a small stream . &nbsp; THORNTON ( with respect and not a little awe ) But my God , ai n't there a hell of a lot of it ! ( pause ) BRIEF CUT TO BUCK all saddled up and ready to get on with it . But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking in , as Thornton is doing , the epic natural panorama . THORNTON musing : &nbsp; THORNTONLike I say , Buck , I do n't ask very much .  --  97  --  I take off for weeks at a time , any time of the year , any time of the day ... or the night . All I need is a rifle ... a few bullets ... a little salt and a little coffee . A few fish-hooks , too . Thornton feels in his pockets and feels the reassurance of the fish-hooks being there . DISSOLVE TO : SHOT - THORNTON fishing with an improvised pole . It is broad Alaskan summer day . Buck is lying and watching . Thornton makes what looks like a catch , but misses . He laughs . ANOTHER SHOT - SAME PLACE IN THE STREAM but now Thornton is panning for gold . &nbsp; THORNTON ( to Buck ) Nothing here . ( pause ) But we ai n't to the great good place yet , neither . ( pause ) We got a ways to go . ( pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ) Mighty good , it is . I do think we 're gon na get there . SHOT - THORNTON leaving camp with his rifle . He turns and says with the necessary severity : &nbsp; THORNTONStay , boy . I 'm goin ' out to get us some meat . Meat ! He gestures enthusiastically , as though the whole trip were a great lark , which , under the present conditions , it is . &nbsp; THORNTONMeat ! Meat ! Meat !  --  98  --  SHOT - THORNTON going off into the wilderness with his rifle . Silence , and air SOUNDS . SHOT - BUCK sitting alone . We PAN SLOWLY over the forest floor , and then slowly discover that there is an animal just barely discernible , far off , in the hazy woods-background . It is a wolf . We COME IN CLOSE on the wolf , and on his eyes , with that curious oriental slant to them that tells the audience immediately that this is no dog , but a creature of the wild . The wolf stands , and we PULL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildness , shadowy and enigmatic , and inexpressibly alien to anything civilized . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details NIGHT SCENE with roaring fire . Buck and Thornton are eating roasted meat of some kind and the way they eat is strangely familiar one to the other . SHOT - BUCK rearing up for some unknown reason , looking deeply into the fire . &nbsp; THORNTONWhat 's the matter ? You hear somethin ' ? Buck lies back down . &nbsp; THORNTON ( soliloquizing ) You know ... when you do that ... it just makes me think you 're see in ' something in that fire . ( long pause ) Something that I ca n't see . Right in them flames : that you could n't see without the fire . Something I could n't see in a million years , even if I sat up here in this God-forsaken place forever and built a fire every night .  --  99  --  ( long pause ) What is it , big fellow ? What do you see in them flames , way out where we are ? Way out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire , this time we , the audience , hear something , carried by the wind . It is a far-distant howl . We just barely hear it , but we do hear it . BUCK lifting his head once more , as if in recognition . SHOT - THORNTON and his flame-flickering face , which takes on at this time a kind of wild enthusiasm . An enthusiasm of the desolate place they are in : an exhilaration of night , fire , of dog and man , and the prospect of gold . Long wind-SOUND , and Thornton pulls his parka more closely about his neck and face . CLOSE IN to show Thornton staring into the fire . &nbsp; THORNTONI came up here to find gold , but the place  --  the snow , the cold , the flowers , these woods ... they 're ... they 're better than all the gold in the world . STILL SHOT - BUCK looking into the fire . &nbsp; THORNTON 'S VOICE ( o.s . ) But I know where the gold is , too . ( long pause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parenthetically , I should note that this is the same place the Stranger said it was , when Buck was first sold . I note this to make sure that we , the film-makers , do n't miss emphasizing the point. )  --  100  --  LONG DAWN VISTA Mountains , valleys , trees , streams . SHOT - PROVISIONED BUCK AND THORNTON making their way along a stream bank . &nbsp; THORNTONMy God , even in the summertime it gets cold . And the summer do n't last long . ( long pause ) But we 're here . Buck . ( pause ) We made it . Let 's do a little work . Thornton is panning in stream . BUCK who lifts head again , listening , smelling the wind . THORNTON still panning , but with an increasing excitement . In a sudden lunge , Thornton leaps upstream , unexpectedly and vitally , as though onto something really extraordinary . SHOT - BUCK jumping to his feet , following Thornton . Then , against the SOUND of Thornton 's panning  --  a noise of both rattling and water-pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening and smelling . CLOSEUP - THORNTON hip-deep in the water of the stream , staring into the pan in his hands , as if into the Beatific Vision . SHOT - BUCK as he goes to stream-side , sensing something extraordinary .  --  101  --  SHOT - THORNTON examining contents of pan . SHOT - BUCK looking at Thornton intently . SOUND : wind blowing , and we see Buck raise his head to catch ... what ? An echo ? A SOUND of animality ? The call of the wild itself ? We do not know . But there is something . ZOOM to CLOSEUP of Thornton 's face . He looks like a man struck by lightning , and yet still alive . He looks down but we do n't see what he sees . He looks back up , as close to the audience as the camera can bear . &nbsp; THORNTON ( louder than any other voice-volume in the film ) My God ! My GOD ! SLOW PAN DOWN to the gold pan in his hands . The Alaskan sun is striking haphazardly off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found among . Thornton 's hand comes into the CLOSEUP and wonderingly picks up a nugget . &nbsp; THORNTON 'S VOICE ( o.s. ) ( as the CAMERA comes in CLOSER and CLOSER on the nugget ) My God . ( and then quietly , almost reverently ) My God Almighty . FADE OUT . FADE IN : Section Details LONG TWO SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK walking through the wilderness , going back to camp , to the two partners . We film this with very delicate filters , for it is the first snow of the Yukon year , and we want to convey the eeriness of it .  --  102  --  CLOSEUP - THORNTON 'S FACE IN PARKA He looks up at sky , from which the flakes are falling with that peculiar grayness of snowflakes seen from below , when they look like descending ashes . &nbsp; THORNTON ( with profound conviction ) This is what I like ! REAR TRACKING SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK moving back across the hills that only a short time before had been covered with yellow flowers . DISSOLVE TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first snow . The three men , Thornton and his partners , are in the f.g. , and the three of them are crouched down against a guttering fire as though they were co-conspirators , rather like men in a football huddle . &nbsp; THORNTON ( with his finger on map ) Here 's where it is. ( pause ) I 'll go to Dawson and file the claim . Will , you take the dogs and everyting we 've got and get up there , and start working on the sluice . ( pause ) We 'll break this camp here . We do n't need it . ( pause ) But get up there and start working . I 'll take Buck into town with me , and bring back a few supplies . You all can take most of what we need , from here . ( pause ) But if we mess up , and do n't make this strike , we deserve to lose it . &nbsp; WILLAmen . We 'll make it . We 'll see you in ten days .  --  103  --  &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy pokes of gold-dust . CLOSEUP - THORNTON pouring a little of the dust into his hand . Amongst this is the huge nugget . Silence . &nbsp; WILLBelieve me , we 'll see you in Bella Coola . CLOSEUP - THORNTON 'S COMRADELY FACE &nbsp; THORNTONBut you would , anyway . CLOSEUP - STONY &nbsp; STONYYou 're damned right we would . DISSOLVE TO : BRIEF SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK going through the snow , everything around them whited-out . THORNTON 'S SNOWSHOES slogging at a half-running pace . I would like the audience to think , here , that the pair of them are in trouble with the weather . Then : SHOT - THORNTON 'S FACE IN HIS PARKA and he has never been having a better time in his life . He loves this sort of thing . He , like Jack London , welcomes the challenge of it all . FADE OUT .  --  104  --  FADE IN : ANGLE with a great burst of confusing noise : dogs , music , voices : a general hullabaloo . We are in Dawson City , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAN over various jakeleg storefronts with all kinds of signs on them , advertising eggs at ten dollars an egg , and so on . I want this whole sequence based on the documentary " City of Gold " , which should be available to any film archivist . SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK walking down the middle of the street . The twist here is that , contrary to the usual movie of this type , there are not a lot of bad men and gunslingers around : there does not seem , from the behavior of the people we see and briefly overhear , to be anything but camaraderie and good fellow-feeling amongst these people . Everybody seems , among these primitive conditions , to be having a hell of a good time : a get-away-from-it-all good time , no matter the hardships . Section Details SHOT - FRONT OF SALOON - THE WILD NUGGET A man takes his big lead dog into the saloon . We PULL BACK and show Thornton and Buck standing , looking up at the sign . Buck looks up at Thornton questioningly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't mind the cold all that much , but I do like to get warmed up , once in a while . INT . SALOON - SMOKY We want to PAN here , over the people . There is confused talk of gold-strikes , and also of the prowess of dogs at pulling heavy loads . We HEAR a little of the conversation of two men on this latter subject , and we leave it to come back to it later . There is MUSIC . The music is played on the twelve-string guitar , and it is reminiscent of the music played on player-pianos , rather in the manner of Scott Joplin or Jelly-Roll Morton . Except , of course , that this time it is on a guitar . We PAN past the men and their dog-and-gold talk down a frieze of girls and women , some of them holding pet dogs in their hands ...  --  105  --  Some have shot glasses , some have both . These are not evil sinners , the dregs of the female earth , but goodhearted girls and women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold-hunting , dogs , privation and cold . They are delightful , fun girls and women ; we must show them so . SHOT - TWELVE-STRING GUITAR PLAYER The music SOUNDS come up as we hear him . He is playing a variation of the introduction to " St. Louis Tickle " , which is very much of a barrel-house , Yukon-type , player-piano sound . We PULL BACK and see who he is : a fellow slightly older than most of the others in the bar , but good-natured and affable . He leans his head on the guitar as he plays , and at one point stops for a second to tune . Then he starts into another section of the song , and really gets into it . This is real funky , honky-tonk stuff , and it should be obvious that he loves it . Then , sensing somebody in front of him , he looks up . One of the line of girls is there . She is got up in absurd fashion , for the Yukon . Nothing she has on bears the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The feathers in her hair bespeak a trying-for-it attempt at big-city high society . Her outfit is both ludicrous and oddly touching . And she is , in a tough , good-hearted way , lovely . Above all , she is sympathetic , and the audience should know that she is not putting this on . She really is generous-hearted , a little dumb , and above all , giving . TWO SHOT - GUITAR PLAYER AND GIRL who stands before him as some kind of vision , which includes poodle dog and shot-glass . &nbsp; GIRLWhat 's that you 're playin ' ? &nbsp; PLAYERWell , tell you the truth , I do n't know what it is . &nbsp; GIRLSounds like a piano . &nbsp; PLAYERWell , it might . ( pause ) But the piano broke down in here last week , and ...  --  106  --  ( holds up guitar with a certain amount of pride ) I got the only guitar in Dawson . ( pause ) So I come in here and play . ( pause ) I sure ai n't found no gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . GIRL very flush-faced and excited-eyed : strangely so . &nbsp; GIRLBut you sure can play good . &nbsp; PLAYER ( ruefully ) Not all that good . ( brightening ) But I got the only guitar . If they want music , they got ta have me . Long pause , and then the Player says : &nbsp; PLAYERI make up songs , too , you know . &nbsp; GIRLI did n't know . What songs ? &nbsp; PLAYERHere 's one . GUITAR PLAYER beginning to play . His eyes soften , with a look of utter conviction , as though he believes not only in the music he has written , but in the truth of the words . ( I have already written the music for this , and believe it will be tremendously effective , not only in our teleplay , but in jukeboxes all over . I think it has more potential , even , than " Dueling Banjos " . ) &nbsp; GUITAR PLAYERIt 's that early mornin ' lovin ' That makes everything all right ; It 's what happens in that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  It 's what happens in that little room before I go out that door : It 's that early mornin ' lovin ' : that 's what I 'm livin ' for . PLAYER looking up at the girl . &nbsp; PLAYERI bet you know what I 'm talkin ' about . CLOSEUP - GIRL whose face is , quite simply , enchanted : &nbsp; GIRLMan , do I ever ! ( pause ) Sing some more . PLAYER He kind of eases back in his chair , which is a delapidated kitchen chair of some sort with paint-scaling legs and rungs , and says ... &nbsp; PLAYERYou know , it 's the kind of song that everybody knows something about , and what you do is to put your own story into it . ( pause ) I 'll make up one , and then play it through . ( pause ) And then you make up one about yourself . ( pause ) I 'd sure like to hear that . ( plays and sings ) I lost my job last Friday But I got another one ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that ai n't fun . But what happens in that little room before that break o ' light Is that early mornin ' lovin ' that makes everything all right .  --  108  --  The Player gets more and more warm to his improvising , and sings : &nbsp; PLAYER ( continuing ) I come up to find some gold , but I ca n't find a thing What I do is come in here , and I get drunk and sing , But what happens in that little room before I go out the door Is that early mornin ' lovin ' , that 's what I 'm livin ' for . THORNTON AND OTHERS enjoying the music . BACK TO PLAYER He plays as an instrumental a chorus of the tune , and then looks up and nods , with a curious look of delighted expectancy . CLOSEUP - GIRL who starts hesitantly , thinking it out . &nbsp; GIRLI been working in a laundry , sometimes I do n't know why : It 's twenty-five bucks to wash your clothes , and only a quarter to dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) But what happens in that little room before the break o ' light Is that early mornin ' lovin ' that makes everything all right . CLOSEUP - PLAYER showing guitar , which he is still softly picking . He gives her the greatest most gratifying grin you could ever imagine . Player plays through another chorus , this time with a couple of variations , not too fancy , but a little fancy , and then looks up again .  --  109  --  GIRL She is in the process of swigging down the entire contents of the shot-glass . She spins around , with unexpected and expected delight , and puts out her tongue , as though breathing fire . PLAYER who is loving all this . GIRL really into the song , and all its implications about love , sex , her own life in the Yukon , and the rest . &nbsp; GIRL ( singing , with great good humor and confidence ) I been working in a whore-house ; sometimes I do n't know why . I ca n't make no money , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my real man , before that break o ' light Is that early mornin ' lovin ' that makes everything all right ... Suddenly , out of the smoky , warm , funky atmosphere of the saloon , a man 's face ( BURTON ) looms up between them . He is muscular and surly , and perhaps a little drunk as well . &nbsp; BURTON ( to Whore ) What the hell you think you ' doin ' ? &nbsp; WHORE ( properly terrified ) Wait a minute , Burt ! I kin explain . Burton looks at guitar Player and very deliberately takes him by the throat . Guitar Player is much the smaller man . &nbsp; BURTONI 'm gon na throw you out in the goddamn snow . &nbsp; THORNTON 'S VOICE ( o.s. ) ( very calmly ) No , you 're not .  --  110  --  ( long pause ) Leave the man alone , will you ? Me and the rest of ' em , we kind of like to hear him play . ( pause ) It 's not bad music , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head as he hears Thornton . SHOT - BURTON AND THORNTON confronting each other . Burton smashes Thornton full into the nose . Thornton staggers back . With a roar , Buck rises from the floor . Instantaneously , Buck has crashed into Burton , in the way he fights best : that of flattening his opponent  --  beast or man  --  and then , when the rival is down , going for the throat . He hits Burton straight into the chest with all his weight , and knocks him over a gambling table . SHOT - BUCK leaping the down table , and going for Burton 's throat , as Burton lies stunned and uncomprehending . SHOT - BUCK 'S FANATICAL DOG-FACE his blue eyes , as he goes in for the kill . He is a true mask of fury , and he gives no quarter , no mercy . &nbsp; THORNTON 'S VOICE ( o.s . ) No , Buck ... Thornton moves to pull his dog from the prostrate Burton . It takes main strength . SHOT - BURTON struggling dazedly to his feet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , checking the flow of blood .  --  111  --  WIDE SHOT - SALOON full of commotion as Burton is being attended to . SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK away from this . Thornton is quietly trying to calm Buck . TWO SHOT - PLAYER AND GIRL &nbsp; GIRLYou know where I 'm stayin ' ? &nbsp; PLAYERI know where the " house " is . Girl gestures , pointing direction . &nbsp; GIRLIt 's all the way to the end of the only street we got . Just at the very end . That way . My name is B'linda . You come on down there , now , you hear me . &nbsp; PLAYERI sure do . &nbsp; GIRL ( with an odd and fetching softness ) You bring that big guitar . But you make sure you come . ( pause , and in the pause she looks , with her dog , like somebody the Player might marry , and never regret it ) It ai n't gon na cost you a thing DISSOLVE TO : ANOTHER ANGLE We MOVE CAMERA UP to bar , where Thornton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the scene has , is talking to a PROSPECTOR , JIM O'BRIEN . He is an old-time comrade ; a big , burly but good-natured looking fellow .  --  112  --  Another old-time PROSPECTOR , a rather grizzling , affable , reasonable type , has his own lead dog with him , and we show this . The dog is a big Malamute or Husky , obviously a far-north type of dog . We PAN briefly to Buck , lying beside the other dog . CUT TO : PROSPECTOR as he gestures toward his own dog . &nbsp; PROSPECTORLooks like ya got yourself a dog that likes to fight . Old Billy-boy here , he ai n't much for fightin ' , but he 's strong as hell . He can pull seven hundred and fifty pounds . BRIEF SHOT - BILLY-BOY looking powerful and Alaskan . SCENE &nbsp; THORNTONBuck can pull a thousand pounds . &nbsp; PROSPECTOR ( incredulously ) The hell he can . ( pause ) All these dogs up here  --  there ai n't a one can do that . ( pause ) You 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord do n't build dogs that strong . They can do just so much . But more than that , they ca n't do . ( pause ) And you should n't ask ' em to .  --  113  --  &nbsp; THORNTON ( calmly ) Buck can do it . &nbsp; PROSPECTOR ( loudly ) You think your dog can break a thousand pounds out of the ice ? And walk off for , maybe , a hundred yards ? You think he could break out a thousand pounds and pull it ? &nbsp; THORNTON ( quietly ) I do . Others in the saloon move closer to witness what appears to be the makings of an interesting wager . &nbsp; PROSPECTORI got two thousand dollars that says he can't. ( pause ) You must be crazy . And your dog must be crazy . ( pause ) I hate to take your money , fellow . &nbsp; THORNTON ( grinning ) You 'll take it . ( pause ) If you can get it . SHOT - BAR-TOP where the Prospector 's hand puts down , with a certain delicacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sausage . &nbsp; PROSPECTORI 've got a sled outside right now , with twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour on it . ( pause ) I been here for three days , and the runners are froze solid . It 's just like they was in rock . ( pause ) I do n't want to take no advantage of no man  --  ( glancing at Buck )  --  or no dog .  --  114  --  SHOT - THORNTON His bluff has been called . A flush of warm blood creeps up his face . Nobody speaks . A hush falls over the saloon . Thornton does not reply . He glances from face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it going again . &nbsp; THORNTON ( softly ) I got a thousand . ( pause ) And that 's all I got . SHOT - THORNTON looking down at Buck . SHOT - BUCK on the floor . THORNTON AND OTHERS By now practically everyone in the saloon is pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost a whisper ) Can you lend me a thousand ? &nbsp; O'BRIENSure , John . ( and he puts a sack down on the bar top ) Though it 's little faith I 'm havin ' that the beast can do the trick . &nbsp; THORNTONAll right . ( very quietly ) You 're on . Great excitement in saloon . Sound is of anticipation .  --  115  --  &nbsp; THORNTONLet 's go find your sled . &nbsp; PROSPECTORIt 's right down to the end of the street . ( pauses ) Right in front of the whore-house . Prospector grins , and as he does so , the strains of the Guitar-Player playing the last bars of " Early Mornin ' Lovin ' " are briefly heard . BRIEF CUT - OTHER PROSPECTORS - WHORES - EVERYBODY IN SALOON The news that Thornton 's dog is going to try to start and pull a thousand pounds has gone all over the saloon like the proverbial wildfire . They are all talking madly , and making bets . As everyone moves to door of saloon : &nbsp; MINERYou 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; THORNTON ( quietly ) I 'm already sorry . pp. 72-88 &nbsp; pp. 116-137 EXT . OUTSIDE SALOON We PAN up and down the street , shaving the flimsy but very human temporary dwellings , and then , very slowly , we PAN to end of street to show the Prospector 's dogless sled . We ZOOM in slowly on this , and it is evident that the sled is piled high with sacks : the Prospector has meant everything he has said about the load . It looks like a hell of a load . SHOT - THORNTON - PROSPECTOR - O'BRIEN AND BUCK walking down the street toward the sled , none of them in any particular hurry . ANOTHER ANGLE to show people lining the street to watch whatever will happen . The faces we see , I want to register in much the same way as the faces register with the audience in City of Gold .  --  116  --  There are good faces and bad , strong and weak , unkempt ones and clean-looking ones . But every face is a face I want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the audience 's own . SHOT OF SLED and of Thornton , O'Brien and the Prospector looking it over , assessing it with professional skill . &nbsp; THORNTONShe 's in there pretty tight . &nbsp; PROSPECTORI told you . &nbsp; THORNTONYou did . I appreciate it . &nbsp; O'BRIENHe 'll never be able to do it , John . It 's not possible . With those runners froze in so tight . WIDER ANGLE &nbsp; PROSPECTORThat 's the bet ! He knew it ' fore he said okay ! Whether it 's possible or not he 's got two thousand riding on this sled , just as it is . ANGLE - CROWD where the betting is now heavily against Buck 's being able to do the job . TWO FACES male ones , amongst the crowd lining the main street of Dawson . &nbsp; FIRST MANThree to one he ca n't do it . &nbsp; SECOND MAN ( shaking his head ) I wo n't bet you . Dust is too hard to get . Leastways , it is for me.  --  117  --  SHOT - THORNTON buckling Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces . THE CROWD which has now fallen silent . All that can be heard are the voices of gamblers vainly offering two to one . Everybody acknowledges Buck a magnificent animal , but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulk too large in their eyes for them to loosen their pouch strings . THORNTON kneeling down by Buck 's side . He takes Buck 's head in his two hands and rests cheek to cheek with the dog . He does not playfully shake him , as is his wont , but he whispers in his ear : &nbsp; THORNTONAs you love me , Buck . As you love me . Buck whines with suppressed eagerness . THE CROWD watching curiously . The affair is growing mysterious ; it seems like a conjuration . THORNTON getting to his feet , and stepping well back . Into FRAME comes a Miner , genuinely concerned . &nbsp; MINERThornton , you 're gon na kill that dog . ( pause ) He 's a fine dog , too . You 're gon na break his back and break his heart . Thornton ignores what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sled-traces . He walks forward slowly into the CAMERA , and the expression on his face is unfathomable.  --  118  --  In this expression are uncertainty , hope , and belief . Then , as he walks , determination , conviction . He turns , with unexpcected suddenness , to face Buck , who is seen about thirty yards off , in a blurred snowy half-focus . The weather is beginning to look like Arctic twilight , which it certainly is . CLOSEUP - THORNTON as he puts his cupped hands to his mouth . &nbsp; THORNTON ( with amazing loudness ) Buck ! SHOT - BUCK quite beside himself with willingness to pull . SAME SHOT - THORNTON &nbsp; THORNTONGee ! Gee ! SHOT - BUCK pulling hard to his right . Nothing is happening . SHOT - RUNNERS IN ICE making the ice groan and crack a little , but not breaking free . CLOSEUP - THORNTON &nbsp; THORNTONGee ! Gee , Buck ! Gee , gee , GEE ! Thornton literally screams this last , like a wild man . SHOT - BUCK throwing himself with desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he has , which is plenty .  --  119  --  BRIEF CLOSEUP - ICE on the sled-runners . It is cracking a little , but not giving way . BACK TO THORNTON &nbsp; THORNTONNow ... ( he pauses ) ... HAW ! HAW ! PAN to Buck as he moves to his left across the sled . We should see the sled shudder a little when he does this , and begin to swing with him as he again throws all his weight and strength to his left . BUCK 'S POV The CAMERA is lurching wildly as though the CAMERA itself were striving right and left to break the sled out . CLOSEUP - ICE ON RUNNERS Suddenly there is a LOUD CRACKING SOUND , almost like the crack of a rifle , unexpected and startlingly loud . A long slab of ice breaks away from the top of the runner and flies directly into the CAMERA . It shatters there . TWO SHOT of two of the men lining the street . &nbsp; FIRST MANGood God Almighty . &nbsp; SECOND MAN ( quietly , almost mystically ) He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth . &nbsp; THORNTONAll right . Now  --  ( and he seems literally to explode the word with his whole being ) MUSH ! Buck ! MUSH !  --  120  --  BUCK straining with all his strengh at the traces . His tongue is out , his eyes are popping , and we must do everything we can to film this to show the absolute physical effort that the dog can make . CLOSEUP - SLED RUNNERS beginning to move forward . SHOT - BUCK now inching forward by exquisitely tiny steps . We see that where the traces are on him , blood is beginning to seep around the harness . THORNTON who obviously can stand it no longer . Prospector who made the bet comes INTO FRAME . &nbsp; PROSPECTORThis is too much , Thornton . That dog 's killing himself . His heart 's gon na bust . I 'm sorry I got you into this . Go down there and turn him loose . BACK TO BUCK who has fallen . We see him struggle to get up . THORNTON as he starts toward Buck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , despite all his efforts , is just not going to make it . SHOT - PROSPECTOR who says to Thornton 's departing back : &nbsp; PROSPECTORYou put one finger on that sled , though , Thornton , and all bets are off . He makes a slashing , finalizing gesture with his mittened hand .  --  121  --  TWO SHOT Thornton crouching about a yard in front of Buck . Buck struggles to his feet . &nbsp; THORNTON ( softly , then building ) Mush , Buck , mush . MUSH ! SHOT - BUCK throwing himself with insane fury against the traces , snarling as though he were in a dog-fight , snapping and slavering , the hair around his neck now showing blood . We PAN to show the sled picking up speed , and Thornton running along beside it . SHOT - CROWD Men gasp and begin to breathe again , unaware that for a moment they had ceased to breathe . At one point , Thornton , who is keeping himself , with great , demonstrative obviousness free from any physical contact with either dog or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is not helping in any way , except by vocal encouragement . SHOT OVER TOP OF TOP-HEAVY SLED and Buck , who is staggering and wavering and still doing all he can do . We see , in a dim and frost-breathed bunch , the people at the finish line . We film this as Buck would see it . The finish-line crowd wavers crazily , their collective breath making a curious and eerie smoke where their faces can not be clearly seen . But they are getting closer . THORNTON BESIDE BUCK Thornton is now not running , but walking , slower and slower . CROWD - FROM BUCK 'S POV now weaving wildly about , but closer , ever closer . From the finish-line crowd begins to come a strange SOUND , a human sound and yet part animal , too . At first it is a low murmur , and then it augments , until , as it reaches its loudest ( which I would like to be very loud ) it is like a hosannah , the wild praise of idiots in a cathedral .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just past the finish line , which is marked by a pile of firewood . CROWD Every man and woman tears himself free of all the others . Hats and mittens are flying through the air , delirium and pandemonium are in Dawson City . Something has happened among the people there that nobody would have believed possible . A sort of mad conviviality has broken out all over Dawson City . Men are shaking hands , the whores get embraced ( they love it ) . QUICK SHOT - GIRL from the saloon scene with her dog and shot-glass . The little poodle yips excitedly . THORNTON BESIDE BUCK Head is against head , and he is shaking him back and forth . Those nearby hear him cursing Buck , long and fervently , and softly and lovingly . GIRL WITH POODLE &nbsp; GIRLHe 's dead . THORNTON examining Buck . There is a little blood where the traces have bit into his neck and shoulders . &nbsp; THORNTONNo he 's not . ( pause ) Just almost . ANOTHER ANGLE - THORNTON gently undoing the traces , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . &nbsp; THORNTON ( v.o . ) What a fool I am . What a terrific fool .  --  123  --  Hand comes INTO FRAME , with two sausage-sized pokes of dust in it ; those that Thornton has won . The hand taps Thornton on the shoulder with the pokes themselves . &nbsp; VOICE ( o.s . ) Here . You got ' em . ( pause ) But I 'll tell you , I would n't ' a missed it . ( longer pause ) And I 'll give you another thousand for that dog ... Thornton , in his crouch , turns and takes the pokes . But there is something wrong with him , His face is like that of a frozen man , and he is trembling . PROSPECTOR &nbsp; PROSPECTORWell ... what 's wrong ? THORNTON rising slowly INTO FRAME . There is something deliberate and terrible about the way he gets up . CLOSEUP - THORNTON 'S FACE It is working , and the nostrils are flaring . He is absolutely beside himself , livid with anger : so livid that he quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there is a suspicion of tears in his eyes . &nbsp; THORNTONI ... I ... BUCK now free of the traces , standing beside Thornton with no collar on him except the collar of his own blood around his neck . Buck is still panting heavily , and quite weak from his effort . THORNTON still quivering with rage :  --  124  --  &nbsp; THORNTONYou can go to hell , sir . That 's the best I can do for you , sir . SHOT - PROSPECTOR taken somewhat aback by all this unexpected intensity , but resignedly going back among the other dispersing miners , whores and others , not such a bad fellow , who meant almost well , but clearly not wanting to have to cope with Thornton 's intensity of emotion . TWO SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK &nbsp; THORNTONLet 's go home , boy . He lifts eyes to the horizon , insofar as it can be made out . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details BRIEF SHOT - THORNTON AND BUCK slogging through the snow , Buck provisioned as before . He is obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramble . Thornton slogs along in snowshoes , his face happy . Buck has made him happy , and he has struck gold . And he is not at all afraid of the wilderness , or of having to cope with it . As Jack London makes clear in the original , Thornton is the kind of man who , with a handful of salt and a rifle ( and now with what he considers the greatest dog in the world ) , can fare wherever he pleases , and for as long as he pleases . He knows the weather signs , he knows the wild-life , he knows the terrain . He is a survivor . Survival techniques are as natural to him as breathing . What is more , as we show in many ways , he revels in the whole scene . DISSOLVE TO : WILL AND STONY as they welcome Thornton and Buck to the new camp at Bella Coola . The camp looks good . &nbsp; WILLWe got a little thaw here , and me and Stony done built about half of the sluice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little primitive-looking but at the same time sturdy and functional . We follows this with VARIOUS SHOTS around camp , showing the dogs lying round without anything much to do , eating , sleeping , yawning . MEN WORKING THE CLAIM stowing the dust up in pokes , obviously happy with the strike , and with the fact that each is making thousands of dollars in just a few days . SHOT - BUCK He gets up and wanders around camp , sniffing and looking off into the distance . We PAN with him as he goes over to Thornton , who is panning . He whines . Thornton looks up at Buck , and then goes back to work . Buck stands looking at him , and then slowly turns his head to the wilderness . SHOT - TREES that lead into the Wild . PAN OVER CAMP The weather is apparently not awfully cold , and , from the o.s . SOUNDS , the men are having a tremendously good time mining and panning the gold . They are good fellows all , and they have struck it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! &nbsp; ANOTHER VOICEDo n't let that one get away ! UP SOUND of running water . &nbsp; O.S. VOICELet 's take off an hour and go fishing . THORNTON &nbsp; THORNTONAll right ! ( pause ) Nobody says we can't.  --  126  --  BRIEF SHOT - MEN FISHING in the general atmosphere of thaw . Buck , at streamside , wanders restlessly among them , looking into the river , then at the three men . We ZOOM IN on Buck . He puts his head up , evidently hearing something that the fishing men can not hear . But what he hears , has him . He is all attentive animal . &nbsp; O.S. VOICEAw , come on , Buck . Settle down . I 'm gon na catch you a fish . &nbsp; O.S. VOICEHey , Buck , where the hell you goin ' ? &nbsp; THORNTON 'S VOICELet him run around a little bit . He can take care of himself . There 's nothin ' in the woods that 'll fool with him . ( pause ) A bear would n't even fool with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're ever gon na see him again ? He sure took off out of here . &nbsp; THORNTON ( confidently ) He 'll be back . I do n't have no idea where he 's goin ' , and when he comes back I ai n't gon na have no idea about where he 's been , or what he 's been doin ' . But I 'll lay those two pokes of dust I won on him in Dawson that he 'll be back . ( he turns to the river and concentrates on fishing ) Let 's make that big fish-strike for supper ... ( he turns toward the sluice ) We might not make the fish-strike  --  ( pause )  --  but we done made the gold-strike. ( pause ) Next three months I want some diggin ' , some pannin ' and some sluicin ' .  --  127  --  ( he grins , and we like him for it ) I do n't want to see nothin ' but asses and elbows . Will casts into the river , liking what he 's doing and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work I do n't mind . BUCK wandering in the woods . He seems indecisive . He keeps stopping and listening , and sniffing the wind . DISSOLVE TO : BUCK IN CAMP The men are resting and talking . Thornton fondles Buck 's head , but the dog seems preoccupied with something else . The wind blows , and Buck 's ears prick up . THORNTON 'S HAND ON BUCK 'S HEAD and the dog 's pricked-up ears , as he stares off at the woods , then slowly , we see the hand withdrawn . SHOT - MEN resuming their talk , mostly in murmurs . BUCK looking off into the distance , and listening to the SOUND of the wind . He gets up , and wanders , at first apparently aimlessly , and then as with some definite place to go . He stops every now and then to scent the air , and to listen . On one of these listening-stops there is the very faint SOUND of a howl . VARIOUS SHOTS - BUCK loping through the woods , with a sense of mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck over the thawed and rotten snow . There , in the far b.g. , much as we shot Thornton when he first appeared , is a shadowy figure . But this time it is on four legs : a wolf . He is in a kind of Nordic haze , and does not seem at all unfriendly . We COME IN CLOSE on the wolf 's eyes , for we want to emphasize the odd , Oriental appearance of wolf-eyes : canted . Yet he is not far from dogdom even so . There is kinship here , between the wild wolf and the domestic American dog-pet . We must show this , as they approach each other . Buck is ready to fight , but the wolf is not ; he sees no need for it . The two canines sniff around , getting acquainted . There is the sense of the two of them hitting it off together . They sniff noses , and then assholes . TWO SHOT the wolf and the big California domestic dog , running together through the Alaskan woods , having struck up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and up hills , and on and on , through the somber twilight . BRIEF NIGHT SHOTS showing the two running together , over the snow-fields . They are running free . BUCK as he stops . WOLF as he turns around , waiting for Buck . BUCK looking both ways : out toward where the wolf is going , and back toward Thornton 's camp . He hesitates , and then sets off back toward camp . BRIEF SHOTS - BUCK loping back , alone . But he has heard the call of the wild .  --  129  --  BUCK arriving back into Thornton 's camp . Stony is mining in the sluice . TWO SHOT - STONY AND BUCK &nbsp; STONYWhere the hell you been , you blue-eyed monster ? THORNTON AT SLUICE &nbsp; THORNTONLet that big ' un alone . He 's got his own ideas . ( pause ) Let 's get to working on this millionaire business . SHOT - PILED-UP POKES OF DUST in a wheelbarrow . NIGHT SHOT - BUCK IN CAMP with the other dogs , bedded down . But he lifts his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of camp . BUCK moving at a leisurely pace through the night-woods . BRIEF SHOT - BUCK killing a rabbit , and sitting down in unhurried fashion to eat it . In this scene we should show a lot of rabbit-blood on Buck 's chops , and his obvious relishing of the taste of this fresh , by-him-killed blood . BRIEF SHOT - BUCK in summer ( for the men want to stay at Bella Coola as long as it takes to extract the very last nugget , the very last pinch of gold-dust ) leaving camp again . In camp , he is shown as he always was , but when he passes beyond the border of trees that marks the first of the forest , he becomes quite a different creature .  --  130  --  We film this to show him , in leaf-shadow and sun-dapple , as something fearful , menacing , inexplicable , a kind of Abominable Snowman on four feet : a devil and a god . BUCK roaming through the woods again . But this time he is not indecisive . We see Buck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DELL OF TREES in which is standing and browsing a small herd of caribou . BUCK lying in the bushes , his blue eyes aflame . BUCK leaping toward her , and herd scattering every which way . Buck concentrates on one animal . One , separated from the others . CARIBOU fleeing through the woods . BUCK loping tirelessly behind . The point to make here is that the caribou , in his fear , is wearing himself out . Buck can wait . He is prepared to wait and pursue until his quarry drops . CARIBOU trying to stop and drink . BUCK His face a contorted mask of fury , charging on caribou , and caribou bolting from stream .  --  131  --  HELICOPTER SHOT - CARIBOU fleeing across an endless plain of tundra . We PAN back , and there is Buck , loping in his effortless stride . CARIBOU staggering , slaver coming from his mouth . He falls to his front knees , and then topples onto his side . BUCK panting , he moves forward INTO CAMERA . SHOT finally , to the downed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unhurriedly . SLOW DISSOLVE TO : BUCK over carcass of caribou , most of which has been reduced to a skeleton . Time has passed . Buck gets up , and starts out in the direction of Thornton 's camp . Several QUICK SHOTS showing the travel of Buck through the woods , over streams , and the like . STARTLINGLY QUICK SHOT - BUCK stopping , and sniffing the wind . He then begins to move forward again , but slowly , stealthily , toward the world of men he has left . We PAN as Buck moves . He stares and looks down . We bring INTO FRAME a body of one of the other sled-dogs , on the ground . Buck nuzzles him , then turns him over . As the dead dog rolls over , we see , with horrifying CLOSEUP clarity , the broken-off shaft of an arrow in his side . BUCK assessing the situation . Buck goes forward , neck-fur bristling . He finds another dog , this one lying in a bush , an arrow clear through him . We COME IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feathers of the arrow , through the dog 's body to the bloody tip . We HOLD just a moment on the arrow-head , and then ...  --  132  --  BACK TO BUCK going on toward the camp , picking up his pace . SHOT - CAMP as Buck , the single living thing in the vicinity , comes into it from living in the wild . Nothing moves but Buck . Stony lies dead over the sluice . Up WATER SOUNDS , as we COME IN on Stony 's face-up body . PAN , to show Will , also face up and with his throat grueseomely cut , lying half in and half out of a tent . But where is Thornton ? SLOW PAN over wrecked camp , down to the stream . Thornton 's legs are lying on the pebbly bank , his face buried in the water . There is an arrow in his back , and , in the other part of his back , a knife : his own , which we have seen many times . The knife has a particular bone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thornton 's body . He comes delicately to it , sniffing and nuzzling . COME IN CLOSE on the two of them . Suddenly Buck , in the old aggression-play , throws himself on Thornton 's body and begins to wrestle the inert corpse . Then , in a gesture of surpassing tenderness , he lets go and picks up Thornton 's dead wrist , which is lying on the bank , between his teeth , in their old reconciliation move . Nothing happens . The man is dead . Buck can do nothing . Buck makes one last effort . He seizes Thornton by his bloody shirt and hauls him out of the water . We COME IN , in a position to see it all , on Thornton 's open-eyed , staring face . It is hard to recognize him , but we do . I want this to be the most totally horrifying image in all of television . One eye is out , the lips slit open . And he has been scalped . There is only a crown of blood where all his long hair has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp , not sure what to do . We see him sniffing the boots of Stony , lying dead over the sluice .  --  133  --  SOUND : We up , just a little , the sound of running water . WILL face-down in the mud . Buck stands over him . Buck wanders around the camp . There is some kind of food in a broken container , just outside a tent . We see Buck eat this , and then go back to wandering . SHOT - THORNTON BUCK as he placidly lies down beside Thornton 's body . We show now , the gradual fading of the daylight . Buck is still lying beside the body of Thornton . The water runs , and the moon above the scene becomes more apparent . Buck gets slowly up , and begins to appear decisive . Without another look at the body of Thornton or at anything else in the camp , Buck reverts in two or three bounds to his woods-stride . SHOTS OF BUCK moving through the woods at twilight , and we must make these shots eerie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mission , and that he knows exactly what he is doing and where he is going . He stops once to sniff the air . The trees behind , him creak in the wind . We see Buck pick up speed , so that the whole woods flicker around him . PAN OF BUCK He is almost flying . BACKLIT SHOT - INDIAN CAMP It is a small camp , with perhaps five or six MEN in it . It is apparent that they are jubilant . And then we see it .  --  134  --  One of the braves has on Thornton 's hat . He is wearing it squarely , and not at the curious angle that was characteristic of Thornton . But he is wearing it . The brave with the hat on walks slowly INTO CAMERA . DARK GROUND in front of his feet . We PAN from brave with hat , going to the right , in an apparently aimless way , over twenty yards of snow and turf . The audience does not know where the CAMERA is going , or what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being shown it in this way . Then , with an unsettling purpose , the CAMERA LIFTS . It lifts through a bush , and into the blue eyes of Buck . This is the key scene in the whole teleplay , and I should like this astonishing blueness , emphasized both in other scenes and in the conversation of various of the human characters , to be the most striking image of an animal ever seen on television . The CAMERA is now on nothing but the eyes . What do we see in them ? Everything and nothing . They are glacial , icy , beyond good and evil . SOUND UP , to hear Buck pant just a little . MAN wearing Thornton 's hat . Suddenly , like a thing breaking into reality from another world , Buck springs . We CUT to the blue eyes again , and they come straight INTO THE CAMERA , as though Buck were going for the audience 's jugular . I want this shot to present such basic savagery that every member of the audience will involuntarily try to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hat in SLOW MOTION . BUCK 'S POV of the terror in the Indian 's face as blue-eyed Buck leaps on him . We then CUT to the ultimate FAST MOTION , the sheer speed of savagery and revenge .  --  135  --  SHOT - INDIANS scattering , fleeing into the woods , anywhere . BUCK pursuing one of Indians , pulling him down , then immediately leaving the one he has just killed and leaping on another . This goes on until Buck has killed them all . BUCK At last he stands among them . He has killed all five of them . There is blood all over the place . We might emphasize the horror , here , by a PAN over the corpses of the Indians , with a lot of gore and ripped-open places on their limbs and faces . We PULL IN CLOSE on Buck , standing amongst the dead , panting the intense moon behind him . He looks around , a good long look . He walks , unhurriedly , out OF FRAME . We COME IN on face of dead Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and terror . Without a backward glance , Buck takes off from the scene of carnage , and disappears into the woods . This is the last he will ever have to do with civilization , its people or ways . He has become , not only fully animal , but a wild animal : a creature . DISSOLVE TO : BRIEF SHOT - WOLVES lying in snow , an oddly family-like association . Buck comes INTO FRAME , and comes among them , and not overly-cautiously either . The effect should be to show that he belongs among them , that the wolves recognize this , and even welcome his appearance . Buck and the wolves sniff around a bit , and everything seems fine , all around . Buck lies down among them . Then some of the wolves sit up . Out of one of them comes a howl , eerie and wilderness-haunted . Several others begin to howl , and we get that man-terrifying chorus . BRIEF SHOT - QUARTER MOON  --  136  --  MASTER SHOT - INDIAN CAMP The main camp of the Yeehats . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firelight : a MIDDLE-AGED MAN and a YOUNG ONE . The Older Indian is discoursing , and offering advice . &nbsp; SUBTITLEDo n't hunt to the east . Older Indian gestures toward what is presumably the East . YOUNGER INDIAN who is attentive and respectful . &nbsp; OLDER INDIANYou can hunt two valleys to the east , but not three . Younger Indian says nothing , but does not seem quite to understand . Long pause in conversation . &nbsp; OLDER INDIANThe Devil is in that third valley . Our hunters used to go there . We have found them . They are ripped to pieces . It is the work of the Devil . A great Ghost Wolf . The prints around our dead hunters in the snow are ... are greater than any wolf's. ( pause ) We do not hunt there . ( long pause ) The Devil is there . He has taken four feet . ( another long pause ) A few have seen him . ( another long pause ) They say he has blue eyes . ( musing pause ) The Devil has blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eerie , and the silence is crisp and icy . Far off in the b.g. there is a suspicion of movement , of a kind of mass movement .  --  137  --  INTO FRAME , in SLOW MOTION , comes the pack , headed by Buck . He and the wolves are loping tirelessly across the snow , across the floor of the valley . We CUT OUT ALL SOUND here . Although Buck throws up his head , apparently to howl , to give the call of the wild , we never hear it . We FREEZE FRAME the shot of Buck with his head up to howl , and then CUT IN one more SHOT , which is of a young wolf , one among the pack . Then we COME IN CLOSE on the side of the young wolf , in the eeriness of the Alaskan moonlight . The most obvious characteristic of the pelt is that it has a long white stripe on it , like the white stripes on Buck 's own hide . This is the son of the dog , the son of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white side-mark . SUPER : THE END . pp. 89-115 &nbsp;
