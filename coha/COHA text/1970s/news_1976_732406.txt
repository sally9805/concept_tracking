Full Employment : The Crucial Guarantee To the Editor : Recent Washington discussions on the latest revision of the HawkinsHumphrey full-employment bill ( H.R. 50 ) appear to show heavy concern over the " timetable " issue ? whether to promise to reduce unemployment to 3 percent in eighteen months or three years or even four years . This is understandable because we should waste no unnecessary time in curing the miserable unemployment conditions that exist today . But timing is less important than enacting a **25;829;TOOLONG law that really does guarantee . The central issue for the drafters of the new law has to be this : Once we reach full employment , reasonably defined , the provisions must assure us of maintaining it permanently thereafter . Luckily , that assurance would be the one thing that would also help most to get us up to full employment quickly to start with . Since all of us ( businessmen , workers , consumers , even government officials ) respond tremendously to economic expectations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would of itself greatly stimulate the economy in the present . In an " economic performance insurance " approach , the " insurance " is not window dressing ; it is of the essence functionally . Inflation would be provided against , too , under such a policy . This means that special measures to expand private and public activity today would Of News and Death To the Editor : In reference to your March 2 news story about Norman J. Rees , who , exposed as a double agent by The Dallas Times Herald , comnlitted suicide , I can not comprehend the thinking of newsmen who , when told that Mr. Rees would kill himself if the story identified him , excuse themselves by saying " the story could not be suppressed . " I 'd like to ask , Why not ? To what higher moral code do newsmen adhere than we mortals do ? The First Amendment may give them the freedom to print the news , but why are they somehow obligated to print knowingly a. story that may lead to a man 's death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrogance displayed is beyond belief . NANCY BOARDMAN EDDY Chevy Chase , Md. , March 2 , 1976 Doomed History Office To the Editor : How sad it was to read the news Feb. 28 of the decision of the State Education Department to abolish the State Office of History to save money . This is both a disgraceful and a wrong decision in view of the important role New York State has played in the history of the nation and also in view of Governor Carey 's wrong and shameful decision to continue in his new " austerity " budget such an intolerable and indefensible item and outrage as legislative allowances ( $882,500 ) in lieu of expenses ( lulus ) . How can the Governor allow the State Office of History To the Editor : I hope that the editorial pages of The Times will not become an arena for petty bickering ? like that in Gertrude Himmelfarb 's Feb. 27 letter ? over the value of private vs. public higher education . Clearly some of the CUNY Graduate Center programs are imperiled by budget reductions mandated by city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperiled by the Regents ' intention " to weed out those programs which are unnecessary or inferior . " But whatever changes the future may ? brine , it is inane and pointless for CUNY officials to attack private universities and their spokesmen who have offered sound proposals which may be mutually beneficial to both public and private institutions . Let 's face the facts : Both public and private universities have overexpanded ; both confront a dwindling pool of college-age students ; both must undergo economic retrenchment . It is essential that cutbacks be rationally planned , so that the best programs in both the public and the private universities are left intact ? and are adequately supported . We need to complement each other ; and we must be ready to cooperate as we both approach the difficult choices ahead . Fortunately , cooperative graduate consortia between CUNY and N.Y.U. have already been implemented in areas where duplicate programs are be less risky than they would be without that overall context . In particular , this sort of legislation must require that a nationwide reservoir of public-service and public-works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition , of course , to those under regular appropriations , not standby ) . Once that perspective has been assured , the extra publicservice jobs that need to be activated now can be more readily accepted by all schools of thought : They can also be more efficiently designed and scheduled once that kind of economic machinery is seen as a permanent feature of the landscape=-machinery that , however , the legislation will authorize to be used only when , as and if actually necessary . JOHN H. G. PIERSON Greenwich , Conn. , March 6 , 1976 to be eliminated while permitting the lulus to stand ? What a commentary on his governorship and official thinking in Albany . VINCENT P. DE SANTIS Professor of History University of Notre Dame Notre Dame , Incl. , March 2 , 1976 The Overfunded Campaign To the Editor : On a very hot night last summer , I gathered with other well-wishers of George Bundy Smith to help raise the $10,000 necessary for his election as Civil Court judge . Briefly , in quiet but firm tones that sounded like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " fairness to all . " In this day and age , " fairness to all " appealed to me , and along with many others I pledged $10 to his campaign . George Bundy Smith was elected , and last week the following letter appeared in my mail box : " Your assistance in the successful campaign of Judge George Bundy Smith was greatly appreciated . Because all of the funds collected were not needed , enclosed is a check in the amount of $2.06 , your pro rata share of the surplus . " In these days of . Watergate , corruption , unethical wheeling and dealing , misuse of public , private and campaign funds , George Bundy Smith 's return of a surplus in his campaign funds should not go unnoticed . MURIEL FLEIT Brooklyn , March 3 , 1976 clearly wasteful of public and private monies . Prof. Peter Caws of Hunter College claims that " the city is not bound to sacrifice the quality of its own public university to save any private one " Op-Ed Feb. 27 . Yet this remark begs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center fully staffed in every discipline  --  a question to be decided by CUNY , State and city officials . Meanwhile , it is illogical of Professor Himmelfarb to argue that " a decent undergraduate education " at CUNY " is impossible without graduate education . " Does the quality of education at Swarthmore or Amherst depend on their having graduate schools ? Clearly not . As for private institutions like N.Y.U. , city and state officials recognize that they are economical , efficient and indispensable to the public weal and must be supported . If , in due course , some of the CUNY Graduate Center programs must be eliminated ? as wastefully duplicating a distinguished educational resource already available in the city 's private universities  --  that will Indeed be problematic for Professor Himmelfarb and her colleagues . But in the long run it may be in the best interests of both the undergraduate schools In the CUNY system and the beleaguered taxpayer . JAMES W. TUMEToN Chmn. , Dept. of English , N.Y.U. Graduate School of Arts and Science New York , March 3 , 1976 U.S. Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Energy Independence Authority proposed by President Ford , which was endorsed by Vice President Rockefeller ( Op-Ed Feb. 24 ) , calls to mind President Nixon 's Project Independence launched in November of 1973 . Project Independence ( very likely an emotional reaction to the Arab oil embargo ) stirred little entnuslasi , , among economists and energy experts . We can not afford " continuing and increasing dependence on imported oil , " said Mr. Rockefeller . He estimated that to achieve energy independence it would cost us $600 to $800 billion over a period of ten years ? a price he implied we can afford . Mr. Rockefeller said he fears the consequences of another oil embargo . If he is having sleepless nights worrying about that prospect , he will be reassured to know . that we have stockpiled enough foreign oil to see us through such a contingency . However , we need not take pride in defending ourselves against blackmail and economic warfare waged by a few puny countries by stockpiling . Another oil embargo would not get very far if we promptly retaliated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countries imposing the embargo and freezing their assets here , with like action against the countries supporting the boycott . Viewed realistically , dependence on foreign oil should be no more cause for concern than our dependence on other vital commodities which we must import . The oil-producing countries need our goods and services as much as ? if not more than ? we need their oil , and they will gladly sell us all the oil they can spare until their wells run dry ? and that 's a long way off . So , for the present , let 's stop dreaming up multibillion-dollar crash programs for a goal that many informed people believe is unattainable . Instead , let us concentrate on achieving permanent peace in the Middle East . Let us also concentrate on getting the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to bring down the price of oil to a reasonable level , For the long run , let us search for and develop new sources of energy in cooperation with other nations , since energy is a world problem and not ours alone . JACQUES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Own a Dog ... To the Editor : As president of the Veterinary Medical Association of New York City , I would like to comment on the relationship of dog owners and the city in the hope of preventing hostility between those who own dogs and those who do n't . It is imperative that dog owners act in a responsible manner toward the people in their community . For instance , New York City has a law stating that dogs must be kept on their leashes when outside . This is a positive idea since it prevents dog fights , mismatings , traffic accidents , dog bites , etc . There is no possible ill effect on dogs . Our city also requires dog owners to curb their pets . This keeps our sidewalks cleaner , keeps our parks and other planted areas free of dog litter and makes the city an easier place to keep clean . In addition , many dog owners are starting to " pick up " after their pets . We applaud and encourage such actions . We ask Police and Sanitation Department personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same vigor they use in enforcing parking laws . There is no reason why an irresponsible dog owner who is violating the law ( and , more importantly , making the city a less pleasant place to live ) should not be fined . Unfortunately , this may be the only way to force some people to act responsibly toward their pets and their fellow city dwellers . We urge that dog owners act responsibly . Otherwise we may find that in the future we will be unwelcome in many neighborhoods and in many types of housing in our city . MARC D. KANTROWITZ New York , March 8 , 1976 Costly Fiscal-Year Gap To the Editor : As a result of the new budgetary procedures being implemented by the Congress , the President 's fiscal year will run from Oct. 1 , 1976 , to Sept. 30 , 1977 , rather than July 1 to June 3D , the present fiscal year procedure . As a result of this change a transition period will exist ( July 1 to Sept. 30 ) . The United Parents Associations is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Education Division of the Department of Health , Education and Welfare for this transition period . It is possible that this may necessitate the stretching of Education Division funding for fifteen months rather than the twelve months projected . Ewald B. Nyquist , Commissioner of Education of the State of New York , has stated that this might mean a loss of $8.4 million for just the State of New York . We are questioning whether money for the transition period has not been appropriated by Congress because of confusion or because this is a new gimmick to save Federal funds and ask state and local governments to accept the economies while continuing to provide the services . It is important that in the confusion of new mechanics we do not lose sight of the importance of programs . CHARLES PILGRIM President , United Parents Associations New York , March 1 , 1976 On the Future of Our Graduate Schools
