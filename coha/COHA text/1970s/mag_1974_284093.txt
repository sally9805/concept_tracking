I do not marvel at gold and precious stones . But I am astonished to see workmanship excel the substance . For I have with wondering eyes beheld a thousand forms and similitudes , of which I am not able to write . <P> And in my judgment , I never saw anything whose beauty might so allure the eye of man . <P> Thus Peter Martyr , a Habsburg court chronicler and diplomat , greeted the Old World 's first exaction upon the New : a stupendous hoard of ornaments , masks and ritual objects cast and hammered from teocuitlatl , " the gods ' excrement " - as the Aztecs called gold-which Montezuma had given to the insatiable Cortes . It was shown in Europe in 1519 , and nothing from it survives today . Like nearly all the gold artifacts that Spain dragged from the New World , it was melted down for bullion . <P> By 1650 , more than 180 tons of gold objects and 16,000 tons of silver had been pumped back to Spain from the mineral veins of its colonies , altering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Golde , " wrote Sir Walter Raleigh of the Emperor Charles V in 1596 , " that indangereth and disturbeth all the nations of Europe , it purchaseth intelligence , creepeth into Councels . " Indeed , the tonnage figure is conservative . Much more was taken than the clerks recorded . And for centuries , at home as well as abroad , all was destroyed . Until quite recently , Raleigh 's " Indian Golde " was still being sold under the counter to Panamanian dentists for tooth fillings . The passage from tomb to melting pot did not really end until , in the 1950s , Colombian and Costa Rican pilferers began to realize that the value of ancient gold on the art market was much greater than even its worth as metal . <P> Exquisite Profession . This dissolution of the art and artifacts of a whole culture to the crude denominator of bullion was especially ironic in view of the sheer multiplicity of use and image in pre-Columbian goldwork . No two figures are ever the same , and the range of imagery is as profuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deer , owls , lizards , macaws , and even hallucinogenic mushrooms . To the gaping Spaniards it seemed that anything , among these singular people , could be made of gold , from cooking pots to ceremonial masks and lime holders for coca chewing . <P> The greatest collection of such pre-Hispanic gold as survived the ravages of conquistador and tomb robber belongs to Bogot 's Museo del Oro . In an effort to stem the flow of these exquisitely wrought masks , figurines , pectorals and pins out of Colombia and into foreign collections , the museum-underwritten by the national Banco de la Repblica-has preserved some 20,000 pieces , dating from the end of the 1st millennium onward , since it began collecting 35 years ago . Two hundred of these are now on view , through July 28 , at the Center for Inter-American Relations in Manhattan . It is a dazzling show , and not only because of its metal .
