The evening news on July 15 stunned the country : a busload of 26 children from the small California farming community of Chowchilla had disappeared . The youngsters and their driver had been kidnaped by three masked men brandishing pistols . The victims were driven to a gravel quarry 100 miles away and forced into an abandoned trailer truck buried 6 ft. underground . Sixteen hours later the captives managed to dig themselves out and were soon rescued . The FBI quickly interrogated them but found no answer to the question : Who were the abductors ? <P> To help crack the case , the bureau called in Dr. William S. Kroger , an authority on medical hypnosis . Kroger sat with Chowchilla Bus Driver Ed Ray in a Fresno motel room and told him to fix his eyes on a spot on the wall and breathe deeply . Twenty minutes later Ray was under hypnosis . Dr. Kroger then led him through a playback of the kidnaping . The ploy worked . The driver was able to recall all but one digit of the license plate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track down three suspects who go on trial later this month . <P> Successful Tool . Though the FBI says it uses hypnosis sparingly , mesmerizing consenting witnesses is on the increase as a police investigative tool . The Los Angeles Police Department has worked with the technique since 1970 . Noting its success , Psychologist Martin Reiser , head of the L.A.P.D. 'S behavioral-sciences services , decided last year to set up a special hypnosis unit , the first in the U.S. Kroger and nine other medical hypnotists trained 14 L.A.P.D. officers in the technique , which dates back at least to ancient Egypt . Says L.A.P.D. Captain Richard Sandstrom , who is currently evaluating the work of the force 's new Svengali Squad : " Hypnosis gives utterly fantastic results . " <P> The Israeli National Police Force , which set up its own hypnosis unit in 1972 , agrees . Its team of trained hypnotists has solved 25 cases and advanced the investigations in 60 more . When terrorists bombed the Nahariya-Haifa bus in 1973 , police questioned the driver about suspicious passengers . He could not remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad , sent him into a medium-depth trance and asked him to relive his workday . The driver eventually described a suspicious rider with a brown paper parcel under his arm . Working on this lead , Israeli cops quickly collared the Arab bombers , who confessed to the bombing . <P> The L.A.P.D. reports that hypnosis has been used in some 70 cases . In one , a woman who had been high on drugs and alcohol at the time could recall no details of the murder of her boy friend , which she had witnessed . Figuring that her perceptions would be " similar to pictures taken by a camera lens with gauze over it , " Reiser was dubious about trying hypnosis . He was wrong . In her trance the woman unerringly ticked off the killer 's physical features and his clothing-right down to the stripes in his pants and the dots in his tie . A police artist put together a composite drawing that led to the killer 's arrest .                @ @ @ @ @
