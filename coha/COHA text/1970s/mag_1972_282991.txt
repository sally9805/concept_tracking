Solutions from the Heart <P> Sir / Bravo to Psychiatrist Robert Coles Feb. 14 , who has discovered that the troubles of America can be identified by any social scientist but solutions will only come from the heart ! Unfortunately the intellectual community remains aloof , intolerant and uncaring about the great majority of Americans . They would rather pick on people 's weaknesses than embrace their strengths . <P> MARTIN C. MOONEY <P> Pemberton , N.J. <P> Sir / I wish all my well-educated , middleclass , narrow-minded friends would read what Robert Coles has observed . Bravo for his intellectual curiosity ! I must admit that this article opened my eyes ; I will no longer indulge myself in pity for the poor of America . Better to have the strength of " soul " than a 1972 Caddie . <P> JILL HALPERN <P> Venice , Calif . <P> Sir / Robert Coles rates a big , nonscientific F because of sheer ignorance of the facts of black life in the ghetto . <P> I lived for a year in Bedford-Stuyvesant ( central Brooklyn ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in building an integrated Community Development Center . We found the overwhelming majority of black people in Bed-Sty neither happy , courageous , nor even remotely " coping . " Alcohol , drugs , prostitution , pervasive gambling , fatherless babies , teen-age dropouts , robbery and mugging are daily accelerating facts of life for the majority of whipped , defeated , unstable black victims of white institutionalized racism . Most blacks in the ghetto do suffer-not exotically , but horribly . Coles ' misinterpretation denies the critical need for a radical reordering of the allocation of national resources . <P> GERALD M. SCHAFLANDER <P> Brielle , N.J. <P> Sir / Ironically , the " anti-stereotyping " that Psychiatrist Coles performs only reveals a neatly structured impasse . Except in the simplest cultures ( to which technology bars our return ) , man is not physically capable of dealing with the number and complexity of decisions that result when each person must be dealt with as an individual . Stereotyping is the simplifier man has chosen to enable him to take action , but as Coles stresses , that simplifier misguides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> ROBERT D. MORAN <P> Boston <P> The Slaughterhouse <P> Sir / Your writers were kind enough to call the Willowbrook State School for the mentally retarded a " human warehouse Feb. 14 . " I am inclined to be more realistic and classify it under the category of slaughterhouse . For what minds these children and adults do possess or once did possess have been totally destroyed by the complete lack of attention , respect , love and training that they so desperately need . <P> CHRISTINE CARROLL <P> Ithaca , N.Y . <P> Sir / It is not just the families of the retarded who are " unwilling or unable to care for them . " It is the rest of society that refuses to have the normal flow of life disrupted by allowing equal rights for the handicapped-or their parents . <P> I may be the only person who has ever been asked to leave a Woolworth store because my autistic son started howling with fear when someone 's dog came up to sniff him over . The dog was tolerated , but society is unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human .
