In business terms , both sides have fired their big guns : oil cutoff , attempted bank withdrawal , asset freeze . What further economic weapons can the U.S. use against Iran-and vice versa ? <P> The obvious U.S. tactic might be to embargo food exports to Iran , which amounted to nearly $500 million in the fiscal year ended last September . The American Farm Bureau Federation would support President Carter if he should cut off grain shipments , as he could do under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act . Cries of " Food for crude ! " are starting to be heard . The White House , however , has no present intention of halting food supplies . If the U.S. later plugs up this cornucopia , Iran will be less vulnerable than it once was . As a Persian grain trader says , " We are earning $24 billion a year from oil . We can buy food any place we want . " <P> U.S. exports of all kinds to Iran have fallen dramatically : from $3.7 billion in 1978 to under $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food imports from the U.S. , having bought 816,000 metric tons of American wheat in the past fiscal year . In September the Khomeini government signed a contract to double wheat purchases from Australia , to 520,000 metric tons over the next six months . The price is about $20 higher than America 's $185 a ton . Meat from Australia and New Zealand , eggs from Turkey and poultry from Rumania are flowing into Iran . The country has also been going to Thailand for about 15% of its imported rice , and the Thais have plenty more where that came from . Were the U.S. to embargo shipments to Iran , food produced elsewhere would simply move from one international middleman to another and end up in the bazaars of Tehran . <P> U.S. leverage is also weak because all commercial activity with Iran has declined since the revolution last winter brought about the nationalization of the banks and most private industry . A few years ago , the membership of the Iran-American Chamber of Commerce was a Who 's Who of U.S. business . From A ( Allis-Chalmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbered close to 250 and included practically every major U.S. company in international trade . <P> Now , almost all have shuttered their plants and offices , or turned them over to local workers to run , and brought their U.S. employees home . Johnson &; Johnson 's plant in Tehran , which made baby products , was expropriated in August . GM still claims a minority interest in a Tehran auto factory , but it has been run by Iranians since GM pulled out the last five Americans and a Swiss a year ago . Last December Du Pont closed its fiber plant in Isfahan . <P> However , PepsiCo is still shipping concentrate to its Iranian bottlers , and Continental Telephone is proceeding with building a phone cable network for Tehran . One of the largest projects had been the joint venture between California 's Fluor Corp . and West Germany 's Thyssen to build a $750 million , 200,000 bbl. - a- day oil refinery at Isfahan for the National Iranian Oil Co . The refinery has been a high-priority item for the Iranian government , which fears shortages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the refinery was a month away from partial operation , Fluor called home its 52 remaining American employees , leaving Thyssen to finish the job . The few U.S. businessmen who remain in Iran represent a couple of banks and a computer company , and they are lying low .
