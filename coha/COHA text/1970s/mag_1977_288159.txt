Brahms : Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel ; Three Intermezzi , Op. 117 ; Three Intermezzi , Op. 119 ; Rhapsody , Op. 119 No. 4 ( Pianist Van Cliburn , RCA ) . The Handel Variations are often thought of as a piece that only a pianist , or piano buff , could love . In one of his most appealing albums in years , Van Cliburn puts the lie to that . Leaping from one craggy Brahmsian peak to another as effortlessly as though playing Debussy 's Clair de lune , Cliburn gives the work a warm romantic allure yet never loses hold of its classic-baroque underpinnings . What ingenuity and surprise Cliburn finds in this music ! What stunning sound-almost orchestral in its power and variety-he gives it ! The miniatures on the flip side are played and recorded every bit as grandly . <P> <P> Manuel de Falla : The Three-Cornered Hat . ( The Boston Symphony Orchestra , Seiji Ozawa , conductor Deutsche Grammophon ) . Like much ballet music heard outside the theater , The Three-Cornered Hat calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russes , it is enormously theatrical , punctuated with expectant pauses from the first fanfare to the last triumphant Jota . Ozawa leads a bright , brassy performance of the Fandango , Seguidillas and Farucca . Teresa Berganza fans will only wish that she had more to sing . <P> <P> Johann Sebastian Bach : Violin Concertos in E and A-minor ; Concerto for Two Violins in D-minor ; Air from Suite No. 3 in D ( Henryk Szeryng and Maurice Hasson , Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields , Neville Marriner conductor , Philips ) . Bach was the field marshal of the concerto form , regimenting the fluid lines of such Italian masters as Vivaldi and Corelli into complex string masterpieces . Szeryng , the Polish-born virtuoso , and Second Fiddle Hasson demonstrate great authority within Bach 's polyphonic ranks . Their counterpoint in the double concerto is superb , as is the accompaniment led throughout by Neville Marriner . One quibble : Szeryng 's treatment of the slow movements tends to be brooding rather than introspective . <P> Puccini : Tosca ( Soprano Montserrat Caball , Tenor Jos Carreras , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opera House , Covent Garden , Colin Davis conductor , Philips ; 2 LPs ) . This interpretation of Tosca is nothing if not eccentric . Davis ' reading of the florid score is rich and clear but systematically undramatic . As the idealistic painter Cavaradossi , Carreras gives a properly ardent performance , but it seems lost on this particular Tosca . The elegant Caball can no more be made into the hot-blooded actress than the eyes of Cavaradossi 's Mary Magdalen can be changed from blue to black . <P> This version is for those who would like a second ( or third ) recording of the opera and would enjoy the sheer musicianship of Davis and Caball.
