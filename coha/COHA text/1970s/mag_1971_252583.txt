At 29 , Don Shevlin was just two months away from taking his oral exams for a Ph.D . in English at U.C.L.A. Today , two years later , he has neither the degree nor any prospect of a teaching job . Says he : " I see myself as perennially pauperized . " <P> Shevlin suffers from chronic kidney disease , an incurable type that necessitated the removal of the organ . Now , in order to prevent a fatal buildup of toxins in his blood , he must report to the university hospital three times a week for kidney dialysis , a six-hour cleansing process that enables him to survive until he can get a kidney transplant . Since his illness wiped out his small savings , Shevlin lives on welfare payments of $178 a month , while the State of California pays for most of the cost of his treatments - which amounts to $3,000 a month . <P> Shevlin 's position is not unique . Nearly 5,000 Americans are currently undergoing regular kidney dialysis . Thousands more would choose such treatment if it were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staying alive . <P> Ruinous Rates . The annual hospital charge for in-patient dialysis averages about $25,000 . New York Hospital 's newly opened Rogosin Kidney Disease Treatment Center , which operates 14 units ( and treated former U.N . Under Secretary-General Ralph Bunche until his death last week ) , charges $200 per treatment ; hospitals in the Boston area charge anywhere from $148 to $337 but bill separately for doctors ' services . <P> The hospitals ' own expenses are high . Dialysis machines cost from $2,600 to $5,000 ; disposable filters and tubing , which are generally used only once , run as high as $14 to $28 per treatment . Almost no patients can afford to pay the full price , but most hospitals will not turn a patient away for lack of funds . Hospitals usually charge patients who have insurance only what their policies allow , then write off the remainder . But many insurance policies fail to provide adequate funds for long-term dialysis . Among uninsured patients , many turn to the state to finance their treatments . <P> Over the Limit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Medical program limits its assistance to families living at federally established poverty levels . Thus Maurice Chriqui , an employee of a Los Angeles architectural firm , applied for help to pay for his wife 's dialysis and learned that he was ineligible if he had more than $1,200 in his bank account . Chriqui was $60 over the limit , so he ran out and spent the money in order to qualify . Others have been forced to sell their homes or cars before becoming eligible for assistance . <P> Most doctors and hospital officials see little chance of reducing the costs for in-hospital dialysis . But medical men are looking for less expensive alternatives to the present system . Many have found that dialysis can be performed more cheaply on an out-patient basis and are trying to persuade insurance companies , many of which now pay only for in-hospital treatment , to finance this approach . <P> Others see the answer in private dialysis centers , which have no hospital overhead and therefore can make a profit while providing the service at lower rates . Boston 's Babcock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to lower its price to $130-as compared to $387 at the nearby Peter Bent Brigham Hospital .
