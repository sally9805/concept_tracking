A tidy oasis of trim turf and ivy-covered buildings , the All-England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club has stood since 1877 as a monument to British upper-class imperturbability . But last week Wimbledon , as the club is more commonly known , lost its haughty heart to the dusky daughter of an Australian sheepshearer and to a fair young girl from the middle-class groves of Florida . Evonne Goolagong , 20 , as bubbling as the sound of her Aboriginal name , met cool , calm Chris Evert , 17 , in the most publicized women 's match since the glory days of Suzanne Lenglen and Helen Wills Moody . The fact that Evonne eventually lost the championship to California 's Billie Jean King ( 6-3 , 6-3 ) did little to diminish the excitement of her encounter with Chris in the semifinals . <P> Evonne Goolagong had stunned the world of women 's tennis early last year when she defeated Grand-Slam Queen Margaret Court in the Victorian Championships at Melbourne ; at Wimbledon last July she beat Mrs. Court again , winning the tournament in her second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer when she scored upset after upset to reach the semifinals of the U.S. Open at Forest Hills ; then in a tournament in her home town of Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , she trounced the redoubtable Billie Jean . Remarkably , last week 's semifinal match at Wimbledon was the first time that the two young stars had faced each other across a net . Scalpers got up to $75 a ticket . <P> The two young ladies took the court before 14,000 spectators with no more visible signs of emotion than if they had been attending a high school prom . " How do you curtsy ? " asked ponytailed Chris before they walked toward the royal box for the traditional pregame touch of pomp . " Just bob , that 's all , " replied curly-locked Evonne . Bob they did , quickly , with a wobble at their knees and a giggle in their throats . Then , on the court , each became herself again - the casual , smiling Australian against the intense , impassive American ; the imaginative but sometimes erratic Evonne against the consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metronome . <P> Chrissie 's relentless base-line drives helped her to win the first set and take the lead in the second , 3-0 . Then Evonne , attacking her opponent 's two-handed backhand with short , angled shots , swept seven games in a row to win the second set and move ahead in the third . Again Evonne fell behind ; but again she came back , mixing the depth and direction of her shots to throw Chrissie off stride . On overhead and volleys , Evonne was clearly superior . In the end , she won the first meeting of the tennis princesses 4-6 , 6-3 , 6-4 . But there are sure to be more . Said Chris : " I 'm very satisfied with my first Wimbledon and , in a way , relieved . The next time I play Evonne , the pressure will be on her . "
