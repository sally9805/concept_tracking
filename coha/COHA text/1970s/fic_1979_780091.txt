 | narrow valley looked hazy through the wet glass , a halo sparkling about each one . A freight train rumbled along the tracks through the valley , hooting its whistle as it approached the small coal town 's first road crossing . Jimbo pressed his hands flat against the slick , cold glass to feel the train 's vibrations . He shut his eyes and pressed his forehead against the glass also . Jimbo Stark was in despair . Indeed , Jimbo Stark felt more despair than even usual . He had felt more despair than even usual from the moment he heard Judy had been elected by her St. Joe classmates , for the second straight year , as the Valentine Ball 's Queen of Hearts . Being Queen of Hearts meant Judy was to wear a lovely crown of tiny silver valentines and would with her lucky escort lead off the Ball 's first slowdance . Last year Jimbo had been the lucky escort who led off the Ball 's first slowdance with Judy . The band last year , a local group called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth Angel , You Are My Special Angel , Teen Angel , and Jimbo and Judy had slowdanced all alone around a slowly melting ice cupid in the center of the lavishly decorated gym . Mirrored bluegreen lights had flowed like small Caribbean moons over the huge silver hearts hung on the gym 's cinder-block walls , had flowed watery over Jimbo and Judy , making them for those magic moments of their slowdance as mysterious as a moviecouple . Judy had never looked more lovely , her blond hair luminous . Jimbo had pressed his face into her glowing hair , his breath thick with more blondness than he had ever known . At the song 's end Judy had for a long moment just stood there in the center of the gym looking up into Jimbo 's eyes . Her own eyes were tropical in the bluegreen light . In her tropical eyes were islands with torchlit long canoes passing between them . The ice cupid melted under the small Caribbean moons of light slowly bluegreen . A long moment , a freezeframe , somewhere forever . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kiss Jimbo 's mouth . Being wonderful witnesses , all the other couples , who had stood about patiently watching Jimbo and Judy 's slowdance , applauded . That was last year . This year ,  | two hundred winter miles away , Jimbo felt despair . This is so chickenshit , Jimbo thought and stepped back from the window . What was he doing to himself ? Poor little chickenshit feeling so sorry for himself . Moaning like the stars were falling . Perspective . He needed perspective . And bravado . Perspective and bravado . Like , man , would James Dean , old Captain Rebel Without a Cause , moon around like a punk over some silly highschool honey ? Would old Captain On the Road Jack Kerouac mope around like a dope ? Hell no , man ! , Jimbo said aloud , snapping his fingers and trying to laugh . Not old Captain Jimbo Stark either , by God ! Teenage soldier of fortune ! Captain Badass Beatnik Poet ! Not this cat , man ! , Jimbo hooted again aloud . Snapping his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to his chest of drawers and got out the pint of vodka he had stashed under his socks . He took a big hit and smacked his lips as tears flooded his eyes . Well , one good thing about living in the boonies with his dear old granny anyway , Jimbo thought , was that she did n't search his room like his dear old mom had done at home before his old man , old Captain World War Two , had tossed him out in the cold on his ass . Like the time his dear old mom had found his love poems . Un-Christian poems , she had declared and burned them . Love poems , of Judy 's blondness , of blankets and Judy 's warm breasts and drive-in movies on softly raining summer nights , burned . Christ ! Crap ! Well , that 's what cancer will do to you , Jimbo thought . Make you get all goofy about religion . Going to every two-bit tent revival that hits town . Visiting shut-ins like a hobby . Jesus , Jimbo thought and smacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My poor mother . Suddenly sad again , Jimbo sat down at his desk . For a time he held his head in his hands ; then , finally , he got out the poem he had begun days before but had not been able to finish . A poem about a certain gazebo and loss . Who would have thought how lovely / those old stones / how gently / how lovingly shaped those slender rails . Crap , Jimbo thought . He  | took another long hit of vodka , then put the bottle back under the socks in the drawer . He flopped on the bed and fired up another cigarette . Finally , after several more cigarettes , Jimbo rolled onto his stomach and felt around under the bed for the sock . Well , here goes your basic terminal case of the hairy palms and pimples , Jimbo thought , rolling onto his back and unzipping his jeans . The sock was one of a stupid pair his grandmother had given him for Christmas , punk-kid socks , green with yellow rocket ships shooting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jimbo crunched it gently in his hands until it softened . Jimbo shut his eyes . Jimbo opened his eyes . The hell with Judy , he thought and with a sigh tossed the sock back under the bed . It seemed so long ago now , that distant , mythic Friday night when Jimbo had first met Judy at a party and his life had done a flip-flop . It had been a St. Joe party and Jimbo had led his crew of Central High rowdy badass buddies there to crash it and maybe kick some chickenshit Catholic punkboy butt . But as soon as they had stomped in the door Jimbo spotted Judy . She was bopping with one of the Catholic punkboys . As soon as the record was over Jimbo had arched his eyebrows and wrinkled his forehead and let his lower face collapse into smiles , which was his perfectly Cool James Dean moviemask , mastered after earnest effort , and he had slouched Coolly over to Judy and asked her to dance . To everyone 's surprise she accepted . Jimbo could sense she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and using his very best bashful voice , he told her he was not exactly some hot-trotting Fred Astaire on the old dance floor and he sure hoped he would n't crunch one of her delicate glass slippers . Then he twirled her gracefully under his arm and went quickly into one of his Cool , fancy shuffles . Judy giggled and Jimbo wrinkled his forehead . He told her he liked her haunting perfume . He pulled her close for a few steps and told her it was the same scent she wore that distant incarnation ago when the stagecoach she was on stopped to pick him up in the middle of  | nowhere . What in the world are you talking about  --  Judy asked , a cute little perplexed frown on her face . The incarnation when you were a saloon girl and had just been run out of a dusty two-horse town by the local Christians , Jimbo explained each time he twirled her near . And I was on foot in the badlands because I had had to shoot my lame horse . And your stagecoach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a past . For years I had been running with a wild bunch all through the OId West . My hobby was shooting up saloons . My fast gun had become famous far and wide . I was known only as Ringo . I 'd often come across my picture on posters tacked to cottonwoods down by the stream . I was n't all bad , though . I 'd never drilled a cowpoke who had n't thrown down on me first . I 'd never ridden a horse into the ground . I was always polite to saloon girls . It was love at first sight between us . You had big orange feathers in your fancy saloon girl hat and your wrists looked just as delicate as glass and you were wearing this same haunting perfume . You are a nut ! Judy said and laughed and Jimbo twirled her again and again , her blond ponytail bouncing , bouncing . Then , while his rowdy badass buddies glowered drunkenly from a corner , Judy and Jimbo danced the night away . The room was awash with babble about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him . He explained to her that he was misunderstood . She told him he had a pretty wild reputation . He confessed to her that he secretly wrote poetry . She told him that he did n't seem as wild as everyone said . Jimbo asked Judy to run off with him to Asia where in a hidden valley he had a shimmering magic palace of silver . Judy giggled . When one of Jimbo 's rowdy badass buddies tried to pick a fight with one of the Catholic punkboys Jimbo broke it up and saved the party from shambles . Two weeks later Jimbo and Judy were going steady . It is the late 1950s and America is a lush , electric , song-filled garden for teenage truelove , and Jimbo and Judy fully expect that their own truelove will grow and grow until the end of time , until the twelfth of never . And all of their best friends ,  | all the other couples in their crowd  --  Pace and Penny , who by that time have gone all the way eleven times , Bob and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boots and Peggy Sue , who fingerfuck relentlessly  --  they all believe also that Jimbo and Judy 's truelove will grow and grow until the end of time , until the twelfth of never . After all , they make such a cute couple , Jimbo tall , thin , dark , and Judy petite , blond . And they dance together so perfectly . Teenagers in truelove , they are romantic perfectly . They make plans for the future . They design and redesign the shimmering dreamhome of their future . They spend hours deciding upon the names for their twelve children , their six boys and six girls . They speculate about their twelve children 's glorious futures . We 'll need at least one major leaguer in this old family , Jimbo says . And how 's about a scientist or two ? And a covergirl who will go on to break into the movies and become a big star , Judy suggests . And a doctor and a lawyer , they readily agree . And maybe a college professor . And maybe one of the girls will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the boys will actually be a senator who just might go on all the way to the White House . It could happen . Anything could happen in America . Because they go to different highschools , Judy to Catholic St. Joe 's , Jimbo to Central High , Jimbo each lunch hour and every day after school without fail hops slow freights in the trainyard for rides across town to St. Joe and Judy 's waiting arms . When she sees Jimbo walking up the hill from the tracks Judy runs to hug him . With a cute gesture of slight reproach she takes the cigarette from behind Jimbo 's ear , then kisses him tenderly and for a long time they look lovingly into the depths of one another 's eyes . Some afternoons after school Jimbo and Judy walk around downtown hand in hand window-shopping . Through the shining membrane of glass they look at china , at silver , at their own reflections . They select patterns . They study the trays of rings . There , that 's it , Judy says one afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Goldstein 's Jewelry display window for what seems to Jimbo hours . Judy 's  | blue eyes have been grazing the glittering points of light within . Jimbo has been rather absently observing the watery reflection in the glass of the traffic flowing behind them and thinking vaguely offish . The ring is a diamond with a heart of r ; rnail perfect pearls shaped about it . That 's the only ring in the whole wide world for us , Judy says , her voice husky . The only ring in the whole wide world costs four hundred bucks . Four hundred buckeroos , Jimbo thinks to himself , studying his reflection in the glass . Four hundred fish . He arches his eyebrows . He wrinkles his forehead . On Saturday afternoons Jimbo and Judy often go to bop and nlowdance on Bebop Billy 's Channel 8 Happy Hop , where more than any of the other couples in their crowd they are stars . Indeed , the small red light on the gliding camera glows like grace upon them much more often than upon any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them they look deeply into one another 's eyes and shyly smile and Jimbo kruows that once again their love is its own program on teevee , its signals pulsing out like light into space , becoming real in some new set forever . It is the late 1950s and truelove can still do this , can be like a teevee serial , renewed forever . America is not yet a rerun . America is a lush , electric , song-filled garden for teenagers in truelove . Long-playing records are a dozen years old by then and stereo albums have just become available . A Columbia University professor has declared that a biological urge as relentless as electricity inspires the following of Elvis Presley , a teen idol with blue suede niggerfeet . Stars are discovered and identified on random South Philly streets . Such as Fabian , who , although only recently discovered by teevee , has been voted by the American Bandstand audience as the Most Promising Teen Male Singing Star . Pat Boone , a teen idol with feet of white buck , has announced that he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales of padded bras have soared . It will be a wholesome love scene , Pat Boone makes clear . And it maybe a good thing for teenagers to see a wholesome kiss , he adds , to  | offset the less wholesome kissing that goes on in some movies . Because of American Bandstand all of the new dances are discovered in South Philly , as though they have been waiting there forever for teevee to make them real . In addition to his daily American Bandstand Dick Clark initiates a Saturday night rock-and-roll show where each week he identifies new stars and proclaims the Top Ten of the land . Buddy Holly , Richie Valens , and the Big Bopper fall flaming into a midwestern cornfield , but they do not vanish . Frank Sinatra , an aging star with blue eyes , declares that rock and roll is lewd  --  in plain fact dirty . Dick Clark makes certain that American Bandstand is not lewd , not in plain fact dirty . Smoking is not allowed . Girls in tight sweaters are banished . Bob and Justine are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love shines from the teevee like neon . They lead offa lot of fast dances . Kenny and Arlene , both Italian , are the starring dark couple . Often they are the Spot Light Slow Dancers of the day . Arlene wears a dark jumper and a prim white blouse , the uniform of a local Catholic girls ' school , which somehow makes her black eyes seem only that much more mysterious . There are rumors about how far Kenny and Arlene go . They get fan mail . On Bebop Billy 's Channel 8 Happy Hop Jimbo and Judy also get fan mail . Often Bebop Billy gives them their fan mail right on camera . Sometimes he even reads it to them out loud . How did you two lovebirds meet ? Bebop Billy reads from a viewer 's letter . She was on a stagecoach which stopped for me in the middle of nowhere , Jimbo says , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . I was a gunfighter and she was a saloon girl with a past . It was love at first sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other couples in the teevee studio laugh and applaud with approval . Bebop Billy laughs and slaps Jimbo on the shoulder . Jimbo 's lower face collapses into smiles . How long have you two sweethearts been going steady ? Bebop Billy reads from the same letter . Since the summer of ' 86 , Jimbo says . We started going steady just two weeks after  | we fell in love at first sight on that stagecoach . Bebop Billy laughs , then reads from another letter : Judy , has anyone ever told you that you look just like Sandra Dee ? Oh no , never , Judy nays , again covering her face with her hands . Jimbo smiles , thinking of Judy 's secret scrapbook , starring Sandra Dee , with its glossy collection of Sandra Dee movie magazine covers . And what about you , Bebop Billy asks Jimbo , our viewer here writes that you are a deadringer for Tony Perkins : has anyone ever told you that ? Well , now , Jimbo says , wrinkling his li , rehead , at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it deadringer for about every handsome hunk of star who ever liit Hollywood , by golly . But usually they tell me I look like the kite , great James Dean . Jimbo flexes his muscles for the camera . Judy giggles . All the other couples , being swell witnesses , lcuigh . Bebop Billy laughs . Indeed , Bebop Billy beams , beams . Always beaming , Jimbo thinks , and in spite of it old Bebop 13illy looks , up close , whipped out as hell . Almost sad somehow . His sportcoat although pink and in style is slightly rumpled . His handsome host face is red and puffy and he is sweating profusely . Being in television must take a lot of juice out of you , Jimbo thinks . Well , here 's one last fan letter , Bebop Billy says , and this video viewer wants to know if you two teenagers in love plan to be married someday . Yes , and we plan to have twelve beautiful children too , Judy says , sucking her breath in as she talks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dee would ever in any movie of her life dare to be . Jimbo 's unruly dork begins to stiffen . Down , boy , he thinks . Well , Bebop Billy says , I understand that today is a very , very special day for you , little lady . Right ? The big , big day . Your birthday , right ? And what 's more it 's not just any old birthday . Gang , our little Judy here is today Sweet Sixteen ! Right , honey ? Sweet Sixteen ! Judy giggles . Jimbo 's lower face collapses into smiles . And , Bebop Billy says , beaming , beaming , a little birdie told me you 've got a sweet surprise coming . Right , Jimbo ? A little birdie told me that Jimbo here has something very , very special for you . And what 's more he wants to give it  | to you right here on camera so that you two lovebirds can share this happy moment with everyone out there in teeveeland . Right , Jimbo ? Right , Jimbo says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sportcoat 's side pocket . Right . Jimbo arches his eyebrows . Jimbo 's lower face forever in some new teevee set collapses relentlessly into smiles . Jimbo threw off his bedcovers and lay there naked in the cold . How could she do it ? he thought bitterly . How could she pull such a stunt like that ? After all they had meant to each other . After all he had done for her . After all he had given up , had lost for her . He had started on his life of crime for her . A life of pulling jobs . He had even stolen the Second World War to buy her that ring she loved , which was not his biggest job , but it was the job he felt the most guilty about . He had stolen the Second World War from his old man and sold it off to the neighborhood squirts toy soldier by toy soldier and this had cost him dearly . And then she asks Hutch Bodine . Hutch Bodine ! Judy.had asked Hutch goddamn Bodine to be her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowdance . Jesus Christ ! Jimbo thought . Of all the guys in town . And they had gone parking , she admitted . But mostly they had just talked , she said . Sure thing . Well , yes , they had kissed a few times . Just a few times . Hutch goddamn Bodine 's slimy goddamn tongue ! Christ ! Christ ! Jimbo sat on the edge of his bed and held his head in his hands . Well , yes , we did kiss a few times . Did you frenchkiss ? Oh , I do n't know . What do you mean you do n't know ? Either you did or you did n't ! Well , I do n't remember . Maybe we did . Maybe Hutch goddamn Bodine 's goddamn tongue . Jimbo started to shiver . Hutch Bodine 's tongue loomed huge and dripping . Jimbo kicked away the throw rug beside his bed and with a racking shudder lay down on the freezing linoleum floor . He shook . His teeth chattered . Judy 's fingers moved through Hutch Bodine 's hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face to hers , their open  | mouths clinging , their tongues touching , tasting . When Hutch Bodine put his hand on her knee Judy for a moment stiffened ; then , with a slight shiver , she sighed and parted her legs . Jimbo did sit-ups until his stomach muscles cramped . Jimbo did sit-ups until he lost his goddamn hard-on . He lay there on the ice-cold floor sweating , shivering , choking back vomit , his stomach muscles contracting convulsively . He was disgusted with himself . How was it possible ? How could he think about Judy making out with Hutch Bodine and get a goddamn hard-on  --  limbo rolled his head back and forth on the floor . He tried to cloud the horrible thought from his mind . He lay there on the ice-cold floor and tried with all of his heart to conjure summer . Summer memories . Summer gazebo memories . . . Judy 's wonderful home . A mansion over on the bluffs above the river , white pillars along its front , broad tree-filled yards all around , french @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient gingerbread gazebo perched out back on the bank above the river like some strange assemblage of bones . They would spend whole evenings out in that old gazebo 's swing necking , or planning for the future as if it were real , or sometimes just playing make-believe , like pretending those tiny lights blinking from boring Ohio across the river were really secret signals just for them from some mysterious dreamshore of Hollywood . Or sometimes a tug would be pushing coal barges down below on the dark water , silent and ghostly in the distance . And in his special spooky Boris Karloff voice limbo would tell Judy that the tug 's lights were really the glowing eyes of some awakened ancient river beast who was rising slowly up from the cold murky depths to stalk dripping and dank through their love movie hoping to carry off the beauty Judy to the tip-top of the Empire State Building and die there for love . And Judy would shiver and giggle and cuddle like crazy . Summer memories . The sweetness of it all , swinging and necking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At last it was dawn . Jimbo got up stiffly from the floor . In the near darkness , still shivering , half sick , Jimbo dressed quietly in the clothes he had carefully laid out the night before : his favorite pegged jeans , the blue shirt Judy had given him for Christmas , his red windbreaker . Jimbo 's hands shook as he fired up a cigarette . Jesus Christ , he thought . I 've got to get cool . Taking deep drags on the cigarette , Jimbo walked quietly on the balls of his feet over to the window and pulled back the shade . Oh holy shit , Jimbo hissed as he gazed through the ice curtain on the glass at what looked like six feet of new snow . Telephone lines sagged with snow and the dark branches of the frontyard maples were piled high . Below in the valley the trainyard looked like a white meadow and the lines of parked coalcars looked as if they were packed with snowballs . The tipples across the narrow valley looked very black against the white hillside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry black spiders . Or gazebos . Strange black-boned gazebos . Now that 's one for the poem , he thought . Fuck the poem . Six goddamn feet of new snow . In the washed-out white air the smoke from the huge slag heaps below the tipples could not even be distinguished . There 's more to come all right , Jimbo thought , looking at the closed-in , snowy sky . The night before , when he had walked down the tracks into town to buy , with his last five bucks , the biggest box of valentine candy he could find , the sky had been clear . Not a cloud . Only coal smoke . And coal smoke did not snow . So now what ? Jimbo sat wearily down at his desk . So now what ? Jimbo fired up another cigarette before realizing his first was still smoking in the ashtray . He arched his eyebrows . He wrinkled his forehead . Well , just screw it , Jimbo thought . Snow is snow is snow . Nothing can hinder old Captain On the Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the Road will not fail the mail ! Jimbo jumped up and bounced around the room on the balls of his feet , shadowboxing . He put Patterson away with a quick left-right , then bounced over to his chest of drawers and took out two extra pairs of thick socks and a heavy V-neck sweater . From the back of his closet he got out  | his old motorcycle boots . Jimbo zipped up his red windbreaker . He dropped to his hands and knees , did twenty quick push-ups , then reached under the bed for the paper wick . He walked over to the window , then took the large heart-shaped box of valentine candy out of the sack and tilted it about in the dim morning light . The box glowed blood red jail the light glinted the little silver decoration cupids into dance . When he heard his grandmother coughing from her room down the hall Jimbo quickly stuffed the red heart of candy into the paper sack and carrying his motorcycle boots , he tiptoed from his bedroom . The blizzard that had swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been little long-distance traffic , only short lifts , and it had taken Jimbo thirteen different rides , much stamping from foot to foot in the knee-deep snow by the road , and nearly sixteen hours to hitchhike the two hundred miles . Jimbo 's last ride had picked him up at a desolate country crossroads where only twenty miles out of town he had been stack freezing for nearly three hours . Stuck freezing and thinking of winter survival . Thinking about some old prospector shufflling on snowshoes across the frozen wastes of some Alaskan miles-thick glacier : shuffling and dreaming his ancient goldfield dreams of glory holes . His half-wild wolf-dog lopes along beside him . Bone tired and half frozen , the old prospector stops to build a fire and rest . His last match sputters out . It is all only a winter dream anyway , the old prospector sighs to himself and shuts his eyes . The half-wild dog sniffs ithout the old prospector 's still form for a time , then lopes off into the wilderness . The old prospector sleeps deeply , perishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road perishing . Buried by this relentless winter like a lost polar explorer . They found him that spring in a melting snowbank by the road . They found him with his eyes frozen wide open , faccing north , only yards from the true Pole . Services pending his thaw . Please , no flowers , no fuss . Never , man ! Never ! Not Old Captain Rebel Without a Cause On the Road , man !  | When he saw the approaching headlights Jimbo stalked to the center of the road . This is it , man ! Jimbo yelled . Old Captain Rebel Without a Cause On the Road is through with this punk Captain Snowman shit ! This cat either stops for me or runs my ass down ! Imagining himself as the driver might see him , a strange apparition looming suddenly in the headlights from the swirling snow , Jimbo stood in the center of the road waving at the rapidly approaching car . This cat is really moving in this snow shit , Jimbo thought , then suddenly realized the car was sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half slid , half stumbled backward into a snowdrift . The car slid past him almost out of sight before straightening and coming to a stop . Jimbo jumped up and began frantically raking snow from around his windbreaker 's collar . You dumb cocksucker ! Jimbo yelled , shaking his fist at the car and jumping up and down as snow slid under his coat collar and over his bare skin . You dumb asshole cocksucker ! Jimbo yelled . The car idled in the center of the road , its exhaust belching clouds of fumes . Wonder why the dumb cocksucker is just sitting there  --  limbo wondered and then it occurred to him the driver just might be a little pissed himself . Or maybe he had heard Jimbo call him a dumb cocksucker and was unhappy about that . The car was an old four-door black Plymouth with pieces of cardboard stuck in place of its back doors ' windows . Well , make your move , cocksucker , Jimbo thought , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . The driver honked . Oh holy hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Captain Rebel Without a Cause On the Road has it made in the shade , daddy ! Jimbo yelled just as he slipped and fell again . This time the box of valentine candy , its paper sack long melted away , flew from Jimbo 's hands . By the red glow of the taillights Jimbo saw it hit the rosy snow and bounce under the Plymouth . Oh Christ , no , Jimbo hissed , getting stiffly up off his knees . Not this ! Not this too ! For most of the past dozen hours of his life Jimbo had stood by the road clutching that huge heart-shaped box of candy feeling like the world 's biggest goddamn sap . Captain  | Crazy Person was more like it . Which was probably the reason so many cars had churned on past his frozen ass without pity . A kid in a thin red wincdbreaker hitchhiking in a blizzard . A kid hitchhiking in a blizzard , clutching a goddamn box of valentine candy . A crazy person . He had to be an escaped crazy person . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard it hurt . It 's under the car , Jimbo called to the driver , pointing under the car and shrugging his shoulders over and over . The driver , his gaunt whiskery face yellow in the dashboard light , scrutinized Jimbo with narrowed eyes . What 's that ? he called , making no move to roll down the 6 window . It 's under the car , Jimbo called , flapping his arms like helpless , foolish wings . It rolled under the car when I fell down . What did , boy ? the driver called , his eyes now slits of suspicion . My box . The box I was carrying , Jimbo called . The driver blinked his wet eyes several times at Jimbo as though trying to focus them , then looked ahead up the snowy road illuminated in the headlights . He took a drink of some cloudylooking liquid from a mason jar he had been holding between his thighs . well , boy , he said at last , after reaching over and rolling down the window , you want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimbo said . It might be under a wheel or something . It might be squashed . I 'll have to crawl under and get it 1 guess , Jimbo said , and arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead , he dropped to his knees in the snow beside the car . The old Plymouth was unheated and cold wind whipped in about the cardboard stuck in the back windows , hitting Jimbo 's neck . He had not been dry for hours and he could not stop shivering . He studied his raw , bloody knuckles in the dashboard light . He had had to smash the dirty , frozen snow under the car with his fists before he could crawl beneath it to grope around for the candy box . It rested on Jimbo 's lap and now and then he tentatively touched one of the oil smears on the once glossy red surface . He had tried to wipe the smears away with his coat sleeve but had only smudged and spread  | them . Some beat-to-hell box of valentine candy , Jimbo thought with a tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love movie . Jimbo blew on his knuckles , then tried lightly sucking them . Nothing helped . The old driver had not had much to say since the first exchange of general information when he told Jimbo he was a disabled miner with a black lung cough who had been widowed twice . Mostly the old driver just sipped from the mason jar and whipped the Plymouth along , the snow sweeping into the headlights from the darkness , filling the windshield thickly around the small semicircles of the slow wipers ' tracks . The Plymouth slid often enough to keep Jimbo from relaxing . After a time the quietness rubbed Jimbo 's already raw nerves and he began trying to make small talk but without much success until he told the old driver how surprised he was at the lift . Especially after the way he 'd been standing in the middle of the road waving like a crazy person . I always stop , the old driver said . I always stop just in case , he added and sipped from his mason jar and then was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might of been a spirit . What ? Jimbo asked . A what ? A spirit . A spook . You know , a ghost , the old driver said and took a sip from his mason jar . Then , after a few quiet moments he cleared his throat and commenced to tell Jimbo about that strange night years ago he would never forget for as long as he lived . He and some buddies had been honky-tonking but he was n't all drunked up . That 's why he was driving while his buddies snoozed . He was barreling over some shortcut backcountry roads he knew . All of a sudden a man was right out there in the middle of the road caught up in the headlights . Clear as day . The man 's shirt was almost torn off and his head was bleeding and his eyes were wide and right down crazy looking . Then suddenly the man just disappeared on across the road . He had braked the car as quickly as he could and woke up his half-drunk buddies and they had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides for a solid hour . But there was nothing to be found . No bloodied-up man . No wreck . Nothing . His buddies told him he was crazy or drunk one or maybe both . They stopped at a truck stop diner a few miles on up the road for coffee . His buddies were kidding him he better drink a couple gallons of coffee black . But he had gotten the last laugh , so to speak , for when they got to telling the story on him to the other folks in the diner the counterman suddenly went all pale . Then the counterman had told them a terrible wreck had happened on that very same straight stretch of road just a month earlier . A fellow who must of been speeding like a demon and drunk as a skunk to boot had somehow run his big Buick up the embankment on the right and flipped it . But they could n't find the fellow . He was nowhere around . And they did n't find him until a trooper happened to look on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's where they found his body , way too far from the wreck for it to have been thrown there . Well , everyone sitting in the diner that night got pale at the same time . There was n't a soul in the diner who did n't realize just as sure as sunshine a ghost had been spotted that night . That 's some ghost story all right , Jimbo said . Well , the old driver said , I took that fellow 's ghost as a sign from God . I had never before taken religion too serious , you know . And I still ai n't what a body would call a churchgoing man and I 'm the first to admit I touch a drop now and again . But ever since that night I got me a firm belief in a hereafter . I got me a belief in things the naked eye ca n't see . That fellow 's ghost was a sign from God all right . And I always stop just in case whatever 's out there waving from the dark is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared of such things but not me . I always stop . Well , it 's lucky for me you do , Jimbo said . I guess so , the old driver said and then after a long pause said : Listen , I do n't mean to seem the nosy sort , son , but could you tell me why you 're totin ' that red box around ? It 's a box of valentine candy .  | I 'll tell you that box sure looked peculiar when I picked you up in my headlights back there . All red and bloody looking . Like you was carrying some kind of bloody human organ or something . Or like one of them old kings going around carrying his cutoff head under his arm . I thought you was a spirit for sure . That 's why I started sliding like I did . Got so excited I lost control . A box of valentine candy , you say . Yeah , Jimbo said . It 's for my mother . For your mother , you say . Yeah . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's real bad luck , son , the old driver said and took a sip from his mason jar , then solemnly passed it to Jimbo . Jirnbo 's eyes watered when he sipped the bitter , licoricetasting liquid . He passed it back to the old driver . They drove along in silence then , passing the mason jar back and forth , until they reached a closed gas station at the edge of town where Jimbo told the driver he would like to get out . Well , boy , you take care of yourself , the old driver said as Jimbo opened the cardoor . And here , you go on and take this along , the old driver added , handing Jimbo the mason jar . It 'll keep the chill out of your bones , boy . Sure , Jimbo said . Thanks . I hope the best for your ma , boy , the old driver said . Thanks , Jimbo said . Thanks a lot . You know something , mister ? Speaking of your basic signs from God . My mother gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old driver said . Well I 'll be damn . Right , Jimbo said . She 's a real religious person . She used to spend half her time visiting shut-ins . Before she became a shut-in herself . She 's the most religious person I know . Gets signs from God right and left . Well I 'll be damn , the old driver said . Must be a real comfort for her at a time like this . Right , Jimbo said , taking a sip from the mason jar . Listen , son , the old driver said and put his hand on Jimbo 's knee . I got me a couple of bucks here in my pocket .  | No , Jimbo said , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . No thanks , mister . You sure , boy ? I 'm sure , Jimbo said . He climbed out of the car . Oh hell , boy , the old driver said , leaning across the seat . I do n't mean to embarrass you or nothing . If you can use a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , Jimbo said . No thanks . I 'm all right . I only have a few blocks to go to get where I 'm going . Well , do n't piss against the wind , boy . Jimbo stood in the now lightly falling snow and watched the old Plymouth until its taillights disappeared into the distance . Old Captain Rebel Without a Cause On the Road has an adventure , Jimbo said aloud and laughed . Well , almost an adventure anyway . He took a long pull from the mason jar . Jesus Christ , Jimbo thought , old Captain done got himself about half shitfaced . They found old Captain that spring bobbing still shitfaced on the surface of the thawed glacier . Services pending depickling . Please , no flowers , no fuss . Jimbo laughed and took another long hit . Suddenly at the edge of his vision a polar bear moved . Or maybe it was a ghost . Who could tell for sure  --  Jimbo polished off the moonshine in a final big pull , then tossed the mason jar out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost . To hit whatever was out there . To show whatever was out there beyond the edge of his vision that old Captain Rebel Without a Cause On the Road was still armed and dangerous . Jimbo stood in the dark street looking up at Judy 's house through the trees of the expansive frontyard . From the tall windows all along the house 's front lights flared out brightly over the snow . Jimbo stood there in the dark street , wet , cold , totally exhausted , and he had never been happier . Well , my ass has done arrived , Jimbo thought , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . Old Captain Polar Explorer has done found the Ice Palace of the true North . Jimbo laughed quietly .  | The snow had stopped falling just as he had reached Judy 's neighborhood . Talk about your basic signs from God ! Old winter had just thrown in the towel , whipped . He had licked winter single-handed , by God ! A thousand miles of snowflakes big as goddamn bats . Jimbo laughed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Now if only I had me a goddamn dry cigarette , Jimbo thought . He could stand here at the edge of the yard in the dark smoking like a patient outlaw of love if he had a goddamn dry cigarette . And Judy , who was surely hovering behind one of those lit-up front windows sick with worry , would see the cigarette 's glowing outlaw ember . Bursting coatless out of the front door , she would call for him . Shivering in bermuda shorts and a thin sleeveless summer blouse , she would rush across the front porch calling , calling for him . Shivering in short shorts and flimsy halter , she would plunge into the thigh-high snow . Falling often , sobbing , she would wade through the drifts toward him , her lovely bare arms outstretched . Finally , crawling the last yards on bloody hands and knees , her blond hair stiff with frost , snow white and naked , she would arrive at his feet . She would clutch his legs . She would beg his forgiveness . He would flip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull her up from her bloody knees and hold her shivering snow-white naked body in his arms . He would forgive her anything . Jimbo hunched in the shadows of the high hedges as he followed the winding driveway up to the house . Jesus ! Jimbo thought as he rounded the house and spotted the Silver Ghost . It was parked in the widened flat area of the driveway in front of the garages . Jimbo was amazed it was not tucked away snug in a garage on a shitty night like this . No one should leave the Silver Ghost out on a shitty night like this . He hurried through the shadows to it . There was no snow on its top or hood and its engine was still warm . Someone had just been out in it . Right ! Someone had been out in it and had just returned . And since they had not put it in a garage they meant to go back out . Judy ! Jimbo thought with a pang . Judy out driving around searching for him . No . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive . Jimbo had a sudden picture of Frankie whipping the Silver Ghost around the dark , dangerous streets searching for him , sliding into snowdrifts , spinning his tires , while hit lovesongs blared on the radio and Judy , riding shotgun , wept and wept . Jimbo bent over the Silver Ghost 's hood and pressed his forehead against the warm metal . Warm , warm metal . Summer metal . Summer at last . Summernight dances at the Dreamland Pool . Judy still in her swimsuit . The firm , girlish muscles of her tanned legs flexing as she dances in the poolside torchlight . Jesus , Jimbo thought , jerking upright . For a moment he was confused . He blinked his eyes . It was snowing again . The back of his neck was wet and cold and snow was caked thickly in his hair . He had a sudden image of himself being shaken up in one of those old paperweight snow scene globes his grandmother collected . He shook his head . Damn , Jimbo thought , rubbing the cold back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old Captain just stretched right out on the old Silver Ghost and snoozed up . Jimbo raked his fingers through his wet , stiff hair and quietly laughed . He picked up the valentine box from the Silver Ghost 's hood and gently brushed off the snow . Captain Cupid , Jimbo thought , turning the pitiful box about in his hands . Old Captain Crazy Cupid freezes his ass off hitchhiking hundreds of miles through a goddamn blizzard to hand his snow-white Queen of Hearts honey this . Jesus . Jesus . They found old Captain Crazy Cupid that spring bobbing still sound asleep on the surface of the thawed Silver Ghost . Services pending . Jimbo waded through the deep snow along the darkened back of the house . When he reached the french doors that opened onto the snow-buried flagstone patio he stopped . Through a crack in the pulled drapes of the gameroom he could see the dim light of a teevee . It irritated him that anyone could be watching teevee tonight while he was out probably frozen to death by the road somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching teevee at a time like this ? Oh fuck , get serious , man ! No way . No fucking way . Probably  | they were catching the weather report and someone forgot to turn it off . At a time like this who could remember to turn a goddamn teevee off ? Well , so now what , Captain Cupid ? Jimbo said quietly and then suddenly began to shiver again . Oh Jesus , it 's cold . Jesus ! Well , so now what ? So here he was , the big hero on the scene with the beat-to-hell box of valentine candy , and so now what ? He had not really made a plan beyond this . He had not pictured what he would do now . He had figured some Cool move to top the whole adventure off would just pop into his head as it usually did . So pop , Cool move , Jimbo thought . Pop , you sucker ! Well , he could toss the valentine out into the snow where it would not be found until spring . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolate , dangerous road where he would surely perish . Oh , lookie , Judy would say when she found the valentine . Lookie what I just found here in the melting snow . A heart . Someone 's left-behind heart . And probably they would find his frozen stiff body the very day Judy found the left-behind heart in the melting snow . And when they told her about finding him she would know whose left-behind heart it was sure enough . And it would be too late ! Oh fuck , boohoo , man , Jimbo said , laughing quietly . Not old Captain . Jimbo tried vainly to snap his stiff fingers . No . No , man . Old Captain would just lean this here heart up against this here old door , then bang hell out of it and bolt like a low-down outlaw of love back into the dark , mysterious night from whence he came . Only not to perish but to survive . He would bolt on out back to the old gazebo above the river . He would hide out there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones and winter there invisible . Hibernate there in that warm gazebo belly and by firelight finish his poem . No , Jimbo smiled . No . That poem was as finished as it would ever be . No , he would just go hotwire the Silver Ghost and head for Hollywood . He would outlaw-roar over every shortcut backcountry road to California he could find . He would get discovered . Become a star overnight . Then let Judy eat her heart out for a change . Sure , Jimbo thought . Sure thing .  | Jimbo was shivering now almost uncontrollably . With a shaking hand he took out his hip wallet and from its change pocket removed with difficulty the only ring in the whole wide world . Jimbo leaned the valentine against the middle french doors and placed the only ring in the whole wide world carefully in its cleft . No , Jimbo thought . That wo n't do . If the box gets knocked over Judy wo n't find the ring until spring . After a violent fit of giggling Jimbo opened the box and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center . Candy blood , Jimbo said , scrutinizing the ooze on his fingertips . He licked it . Hmmmmmmm , good ! Cherry candy blood ! Jimbo fell to his knees in the snow , choking back laughter . Cherries are so yummy ! So yummy for the tummy ! And they are so fun to eat ! Jimbo stuffed his fist in his mouth and rocked back and forth . Oh Jesus , I have gone crazy at last , Jimbo sighed and wiped the tears from his eyes . He stood up stiffly and leaned the valentine back against the door . He arched his snow-filled eyebrows and wrinkled his numb forehead and for a few moments just stood there in the deep silence of the falling snow . Shave and a haircut , two bits .. . Jimbo banged with all of his strength against the door and swirled to run . This time when he slipped Jimbo bounced on his stomach and slid across the snowpacked patio headfirst into a drift at the edge of the yard . It 's all just a cartoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . Just a fucking cartoon . The bright patio lawn lights flashed on . Jimbo pictured the box of valentine candy sailing like a strange red bird out into the dark yard when he heard the solid whack as the french doors were thrown open . Maybe I am buried deeper in this snow than I think , Jimbo hoped . Maybe they wo n't spot me . Then , just as he began to shiver violently again , and to whimper , whimper although he bit his lip until he tasted blood , Jimbo hoped that if they did have to spot him at least it would be sometime before spring .  | The movie begins and you , James Dean , are lying drunk in a gutter , your face framed in a closeup . Curled childlike about a toy mechanical monkey , your sidekick , you are mooing , mooing , mocking the sirens that blare with anger and danger and with fear from somewhere in the dark adult distance .

All I ever wanted was a real chance . In this movie it is Easter . Also at the police station on Easter in this movie are your co-stars Sal Mineo and the beautiful Natalie Wood . Sal Mineo 's movierole Plato , confused , lonely , frightened , is at the police station because he just celebrated his sixteenth birthday by blowing out the brains of five puppies . All he ever wanted also was compassion , understanding , love : especially on his sixteenth birthday , especially on Easter . Natalie Wood 's beautiful movierole Judy is at the police station because she was picked up walking the dark adult streets alone . Her father had called her a tramp because of the ruby red lipstick on her sweet teen lips . She had run out of the house into the dangerous adult night to suffer , perhaps to die . It is chilly in the police station on Easter and Natalie Wood 's movierole Judy looks cold so , wrinkling your forehead and arching your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is your most magic Cool look , as tender or tough as you need it to be , you tenderly offer her your sportcoat .

At last your folks show up , called from an Easter party , dressed to the gills . Immediately your dear old moviemom begins to moan that now the family will have to move once again , that they will have to leave this town just like the towns before when you got into trouble , when you fell into disgrace . It 's the same old song and dance , your moviemom moans . Your movie dad , starring Jim Backus , offers a fat Havana to the tough but understanding cop who is in charge of your case . The boy just got a little loaded on Easter is all , your movie dad says , laughing nervously . Right , Jimbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to celebrate Easter . The tough but understanding cop takes you into his office for a little heart-to-heart . They 're a circus , you tell him about your family . Why did you have to leave the last town ? he asks you . I beat a kid up . I beat him up real bad , you say , wrinkling your forehead . Why , son ? I had to , you tell him , arching your eyebrows . He called me chicken . The tough but understanding cop continues to ask you touchy questions . Finally , on cue , you take a swing at him . He ducks it easily , then shoves you into a chair and takes his coat off ready for your teenage action . He suggests that if you want to hit something and stay out of trouble why not take on his desk ? Really ? you ask , your lower face collapsing into smiles . Sure , he says , why not ? In a closeup the tough but understanding cop 's face flinches with pain and recognition and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fists bloody against the desk . You moan . You moo . You moan .

On that mythic Friday night hfirst saw Rebel Without a On that mythic Friday night he first saw Rebel Without a  | Cause , Jimbo Stark slouched out of the Palace Theatre as James Dean 's moviedouble and was for the first time in his life Cool . But Jimbo soon discovered that it was not easy to stay Cool . He had to practice . He had to practice leaning Coolly against things for hours , hours . It took him months to master his Cool slouch . And in every reflecting surface he encountered , mirrors , plate-glass windows , hubcaps , Jimbo practiced his Cool expressions like piano : arching his eyebrows , wrinkling his forehead , letting his lower face collapse into smiles , until his flesh ached with the effort . But more difficult than these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be truly intense , to be sensitive , to be confused , to be misunderstood , and , most important , to suffer . Ultimately , Jimbo became the most intense , sensitive , confused , misunderstood , suffering James Dean moviedouble in his whole highschool . He resigned his positions as vicepresident of the sophomore class and as treasurer of the science club . He was tossed off both the basketball and track teams for public drunkenness . He started cutting classes and smoking in the washrooms . He started keeping a pint of vodka in his hall locker . He got into fights . Finally the principal of Central High called Jimbo into his office for a heart-to-heart . The principal was a kindly old gentleman who had years earlier taught Jimbo 's old man highschool algebra . The kindly old principal had taken an interest in Jimbo and was truly distressed that Jimbo had started to go bad . He lectured Jimbo about how he could be a real credit to his family and his community and even his country someday , son , if only he applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a doctor or engineer . Who knows ? The sky is the limit in America , son . Now , it is supposed to be confidential information but maybe you should know that according to our tests you have the third-highest IQ in the whole highschool , son , so there 's absolutely no reason for your poor showing of late . But there was a reason , Jimbo said , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead and slouching ever deeper in the  | chair in front of the principal 's desk . I am , Jimbo explained patiently in his special quiet , faltering voice : confused , misunderstood . Then , to the kindly old principal 's astonishment , , limbo suddenly mooed like a wounded bull and began pounding his fists against the desk . With actual tears in his kindly old eyes , the principal suspended Jimbo until such a time as he decided to sincerely shape up , son , and fly right . Jimbo spent the rest of that morning playing pinball machines in the greasy-spoon diner across the street from the highschool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a lift to the edge of town . Tell them you last saw me heading down the Mississippi on a raft with a runaway nigger , Jimbo said to Pace and winked . Jimbo slouched to the side of the road and stuck out his thumb . Jimbo 's old man had to drive over three hundred miles to pick Jirnbo up after he was caught hitchhiking by a nosy sheriff . After picking Jimbo up at the county jail Jimbo 's old man checked them into a local motel for a night 's rest before the long trip home . Jimbo 's old man was grim . Jimbo prepared himself for pain . The first thing Jimbo 's old man did when they got into their motel room was click on the teevee . To hide the screams and pleas for mercy , Jimbo figured . But , limbo 's old man was strangely quiet and he just sat there on the end of the bed , not even taking his overcoat off , elbows on his knees , his huge hands flopped like fish between his legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Jimbo 's old man did n't change channels or anything . Jimbo sat in a chair in the corner waiting for his old man to make his move . But his old man just sat there looking like a worn-out John Wayne after a roundup or something . That 's who he was a cic'adringer for all right , Jimbo thought . John fucking Wayne . : veryone said so . After a time the teevee began to roll but . limbo 's old man did n't do anything about it . He just sat there on the end of the bed watching old Popeye and Olive Oyl rolling on the screen as though that was the way the cartoon was meant be . More time passed . Jimbo did not know what to do . Finally , he got up to adjust the set himself . As Jimbo passed  | by suddenly his old man jumped up and grabbed him by the front of his shirt . Oh Jesus , this is it , Jimbo thought . Jimbo 's old man pulled Jimbo 's face so near his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the closest he had been physically to his old man since he was a kid and for some reason he suddenly felt more embarrassed than frightened . His old man 's breath smelled like whiskey and wintergreen mints . Jimbo could smell his old man 's Old Spice after-shave . Images of the teevee screen were gathered like crazy moons in the centers of his old man 's thick glasses and instead of his eyes Jimbo could see only those rolling cartoons . Finally , after what seemed hours , Jimbo 's old man just shook his head slowly and let Jimbo 's shirt front loose . A little later they went out to a diner for sandwiches , then returned to the room where they spent the rest of the evening silently watching teevee . Jimbo kept thinking about that night years earlier when his old man had taken him for the first time to discover television , and how for a long time television had been a sort of hobby for them . It had been the only way they could usually talk . They would sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though teevee were some strange medium they , ghosts from different dimensions , different channels , had to filter themselves through to talk . But even that had long ago ended . They had to sleep in the same bed together that night in the motel . Jimbo lay there on the edge of his side as still as death . He hardly breathed . He stared at the ceiling . He was afraid to close his eyes . He did not want to fall asleep . He was afraid that if he did fall asleep he might roll over somehow and touch his old man . Jimbo 's old man 's nickname was Captain . He got it early in boyhood , when as the boldest and toughest and swiftest squirt in town he was always the leader , the Captain . He was prepared at any moment at any place to monster-fart , to ape a cripple , to fake a fit . He would take any dare , would waterballoon or snowball old ladies , teachers who might recognize  | him , copcars , the blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' windows . He would ring their bells , then dash into the giggle-filled darkness , leaving against their doors leaning Coke bottles of steamy squirt piss . He would stuff three fingers down his throat and off any movie theatre balcony in town puke like a dog . On the morning after the December 7 , 1941 , low-down Nip sneak attack on Pearl Harbor , Captain led a crew of his local buddies down to the recruitment office two hours before it opened . The enlistment line would begin behind them , by God . They waited there in a freezing rain . They stamped their feet and cursed and blew in their cupped hands ? Some of them were drunk . Boomer , Captain 's best friend and sidekick since childhood , was drunker than anyone . Boomer was the town 's richest mortician 's son and he had been a clown all his life . He was the town 's most feeble twenty-year-old coughing drunk and no one took him seriously at all . It was a joke that he was standing right behind Captain waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Boomer would try to muster the boys in line into a patriotic song , but most everyone ignored him . Most everyone just stood there in the cold rain grimly . Captain did not sing along with Boomer either , but he was not grim . Captain was not even particularly cold . Captain had never been happier in his life . Because he had attended a military school all through highschool and for two years of college Captain entered the army as a second lieutenant and after basic training and officers ' school was sent to Fort Benning in Georgia as an instructor . After being stuck stateside until he almost despaired , until he Mt almost as rejected by the Second World War as Boomer had been , Captain was shipped finally to the European Theatre , to France , to become a hero for the first time at the Battle of the Bulge . It had been near Christmas and presents and even fruitcakes from Mom had been flown to the troops and for weeks they had been capturing mere Nazi boys and old men . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | were confident in Christmas that year , confident it would be jolly and white and perhaps even star Bob Hope or Bing . Then , suddenly , in night assaults Nazis were coming down the chimney and Bastogne was surrounded and there were rumors of American prisoners being massacred , boys being taken by truckloads to lonely snowy fields and there machine-gunned down like dogs . Captain had been a hero in that Christmas battle all right . He had held his position and he had led a daring Christmas counterattack . And for the rest of his life Nazi panzers would push relentlessly through the winter woods of his Christmas dreams , emerging suddenly out of the swirling snow , emerging always silently in his Christmas dreams from the snow-white forests to roll across the frozen open field toward where he waits happily . Captain was promoted to lieutenant . All in all Captain 's picture was in the town 's local newspaper five times during the duration and twice it even made the front page of the state 's biggest newspaper , making him truly famous . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photo taken just before Captain was shipped overseas , in which he is in full uniform and is smiling a wide , toothy , confident smile . Captain 's young bride dutifully saved a dozen clippings each time his picture appeared , even during the dark days of the strange laughter behind closed doors and the parade of new uncles forJimbo . She kept them in her hope chest , along with the linens and monogrammed towels , the china and the silver settings , all the wedding gifts she hoarded for the time the world became real once again . How or exactly when Jimbo got to the clippings she did not know . One of those lonely , rainy afternoons she overnipped and napped perhaps . She wept when she first found them . But later , much later , years later in fact , she would come accidentally across them and laugh , enjoying them , enjoying the Captain 's goofy crayoned face , the blacked-out teeth , the red mustaches and green beards , the pointy purple piggy ears , the crossed cartoon eyes . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Second World War and for years and years afterward this illuminated his life . So Jimbo 's old man , his daddy , is coming home a hero from France . France is across an ocean . Jimbo tries to imagine France . He tries to imagine an ocean . Who are you going to vote for when you grow up ? big people ask Jimbo . Not that Harry Truman , Jimbo tells them cutely and they laugh and laugh . Where is your daddy ? they ask him . In France shooting Hitler , Jimbo says cutely and they laugh and laugh . Jimbo tries to imagine Hitler and shooting and he tries to imagine his daddy with a tommy gun doing it . Rat-a-tat-tat , like in the movies , Jimbo imagines , and Hitler grabs his spilling guts and falls off a building splat into the gutter far below . Lots of people go to meet Jimbo 's daddy at the train station . There is a band playing and later a parade . But does Jimbo really remember this ? Does he really remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices coming from somewhere in the house . But is he asleep ? Perhaps he is dreaming . Should he be frightened ? The room is suddenly so noisy and bright and Jimbo 's eyes are so sleepy . He is being lifted up so high . The room is full of big people . He is being kissed and kissed and his neck is nuzzled and for the first time he smells his daddy . I have everything you sent me from the army , Jimbo tells his daddy . Jimbo sits in his daddy 's lap and in one of his favorite books points out all the words he has somehow magically come to know . When he asks his daddy if he is going to live here now all the time his daddy laughs and hugs Jimbo tightly and tells Jimbo he will never leave them ever again . A war hero . A beautiful waiting wife . A healthy chip-offthe-old-block baby boy . A world made safe . Nearly two thousand bucks won at poker on the ship home . A waiting job managing old Uncle Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good enough for a start . Then the whole goddamn town turns out at the train station . A band , the mayor , a state senator , a parade . So pert and pretty , so sweet- smelling this waiting wife , this cute , slightly daffy June Allyson dreambride of his memory . But these signals she claims she gets from God . And this strange , quiet little kid who can read at three . Hell , I could hardly talk at three . But , hell , two thousand bucks , a shiny new Ford , some snazzy furniture , brand-new appliances , cute little house . Maybe later a shop in the basement and a big Lionel train set for the kid . Damn right . A shiny new Ford for drives on warm summer evenings with the little lady and the kid , slowly cruising through the swell sections of town , looking in the picture windows of the big brick homes , checking the fancy layouts for decoration ideas , or sometimes just cruising around town singing songs together , the kid even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up some vanilla icecream on the way home . In the middle of this new life you return home from driving around town one warm summer evening , your boy sleepy in the backseat , your little lady humming softly along with a song on the radio , the vanilla icecream getting nice and melty the way you like it . You pull your new Ford , which you washed and waxed that afternoon , into your driveway . You click off the headlights and then for a few moments just sit there waiting for the song to end , just sit there enjoying the smell of the summer evening and of your wife and the new smell of the Ford 's interior . Well , you say , turning off the radio and engine and patting your little lady 's thigh , you tote the icecream and I 'll tote the squirt . You get out of your new Ford and stretch . The glow of the streetlight is silvery on the leaves of the frontyard maples and over the old bricks of the street and the lawns shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then open the backseat door and gently shake your boy awake . You pick him up , enjoying as always the clean boysmell of his hair . Still half asleep , he wraps his arms around your neck . As you wait for your little lady you gaze about . You just ca n't get over how beautifully strange everything seems tonight , the rich smells , the way the neighborhood shines in the streetlight 's glow ,  | grainy and mysterious somehow , like an old-timey photograph , and you have this haunting feeling you somehow have been here in this exact time and place before but just ca n't quite remember when . Captain , hey , Captain , someone huskily whispers from your neighbor Bill Fox 's front porch next door . In that same instant you notice that your neighbor across the street , Pat Massy , a one-armed drunken veteran you pity , is sitting at the top of his front porch steps . By the glow of the streetlight you see that he is sitting there in the dark holding in his remaining hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's already shot out in the yard twice , Bill Fox pants as he emerges suddenly from the dark of his yard . He says he 's gon na shoot Mabel when she gets home . He 's drunk as a skunk . We already called the sheriff . Then you realize that the porches all along the street are buzzing with whispering neighbors . Oh sweet Jesus , your little lady whispers . Here , take the boy , you say calmly , handing him gently to your little lady . Then you , Captain , Captain , Captain , stroll slowly down your driveway into the sweet , luminous street . You stop in its dead center , a glowing bell of streetlight about you , and call calmly : Pat . Pat , old boy , it 's Captain . Oh sweet Jesus , no , your little lady gasps behind you . Honey , come on back here . Honey , she calls , come back . Pat Massy jerks suddenly up to his feet and stands there weaving on his porch 's top step . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streetlight . Who goes there ? he yells . It 's just me , Captain , you say , or someone says , for somehow you are outside yourself . You feel as though you are outside yourself looking at yourself . You are a neighbor in this moment seeing yourself from a neighbor 's front porch and in this eight suddenly your life has a clarity it has never had before . You walk slowly on across the street and through Pat Massy 's frontyard up to his steps . In your ringing ears the intense  | whispering of the neighbors is like wind of insects . You feel strangely light-headed , dizzy almost . Your mouth tastes like brass , but it is sweet . You have never been happier . Not even as a boy . Not even in your war . Who goes there ? Pat Massy says feebly , weaving , trying to focus his eyes on you , the pistol held limply now at his side , the stump of his left arm twitching randomly as though a thing independent of his thin body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold front teeth gleam . He slumps back down to sit on the top step again . It 's just me , Captain , you say quietly , taking out and lighting a cigarette , then offering it to him . What , with my stump ? Pat Massy says , still trying to focus his wet , runny eyes on you . Vomit covers his shirt front and pants . Hold it with my stump . Is that how ? I ca n't hold it with this hand , he says , shaking the pistol in the air . I got to hold my gun in this hand ' cause it 's the only goddamn hand I got so fuck your cigarette , see ! Why do n't you just put the gun away , Pat . You do n't need it . The shit I do n't need it , he says , trying feebly to push himself to his feet again , then , failing , falling back to his seat . The shit I do n't . I need this gun to stick up Mabel 's whore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na stick it up in there and blast away . I 'm gon na blow Mabel 's whore pussy to hell . You do n't mean that , Pat . That 's just bad trouble is all , old buddy . The sheriffs patrol car , siren off and lights out , glides slowly up in front of the house and stops . Sheriff Dipero and his deputy , Bob , get out . Both are carrying shotguns . Is that Mabel , that cocksucking whore ? Pat Massy mumbles , trying to focus his eyes on the sheriff and his deputy . That 's no one , do n't worry , you tell him and calmly wave back the officers , old friends of yours who will be confident you have the situation well in hand . Now , come on , Pat , old buddy . Let 's put the pistol away . Put it down and let 's have a drink . By God , I could use a good  | stiff shot . Let 's tie one on and talk about it all . How 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new hole . You do n't mean that , Pat . You do n't really want to do that . Fuck I do n't . Just ' cause you were n't man enough . What , Pat ? I did n't get you , old buddy . Big hero . Just ' cause you did n't have the balls . Big hero . I did n't have what ? Balls ! Balls ! Big hero . Some big shit hero . What 's that mean , Pat ? I do n't get you . Balls ! Buddy , you did n't have ' em plain and simple . Big hero did n't have ' em when it was his turn . I just do n't get you , Pat . Balls , goddamn it ! To shoot your own whore when she had it coming . Should of shot her stinking pussy off . What the shit are you talking about ? Big hero 's wife . Big hero 's whore ! Big hero off winning the war . Whore sucked off half the cocks in town . Your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead center of Pat Massy 's laughing face , arching him backward onto the porch where he thuds heavily . The pistol clatters across the boards . Pat Massy 's legs twitch . Pat Massy vomits like a fountain . Pat Massy 's face seems bird-frail beneath your raining blows , as it breaks up bleeding , its parts shifting strangely about , caving at last inward , until they pull you , Captain , the winner again , from him . Your June Allyson dreambride dutifully clips the front-page article about how you saved the neighborhood and adds it to the other clippings in her collection . They use the same old photo they have always used , the full-uniform , toothy , confident one . As it turns out this is the end of your dreambride 's collection , the end of her longtime hobby , for you , Captain , will never get your picture in the papers again . You got your Coke and candy handy , soldierboy ? Captain asks . Jimbo nods yes . They are sitting on boxes in back of the appliance store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desk  | across the room and all about them are the darkened shapes of appliances humming like sleeping creatures . Everything else is quiet . Jimbo feels strangely like an intruder in some sort of sanctum . He thinks of the grave-robbing scene in the Wolfman movie and he shivers . At any moment he half expects to hear some floating , spooky radio voice like the one on Lights Out telling him to beware of the unknown , telling him there are things men were not meant to know . Beware of the unknown . Beware of the unknown . Go back . Go back before it is too late . Only the Shadow knows . Only the Shadow knows , Jimbo says to himself and shivers with excitement . He is sitting on boxes in the spooky near-darkness with his dad , and they are going to discover television together . They almost did not get to go to discover television together , however . Jimbo 's mother had been dead set against it . What would your Uncle Bob think about you sneaking around the store at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother had said , standing at the kitchen sink washing dinner dishes , her back to them , her orange hair glowing in the bright overhead light like filament . It wo n't do any harm , Captain had said . Uncle Bob does n't have to know a thing about it . He never goes by the store at night . They 're the first two television sets in town and we 're displaying them starting tomorrow morning . It wo n't hurt a thing to let the boy see television ahead of his pals . It 'll make him a big shot with his little pals to see television first . Well , I 'm dead set against it , Jimbo 's mother had said and turned around from the sink to glare at Captain . For a few moments Jimbo 's parents remained like that , eyes locked , and Jimbo 's heart sank . In a sudden gulp Captain polished off his scotch and milk . Nuts , Captain said . Captain takes a long pull from his brown-bagged pint bottle of bourbon . Are you ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Jimbo nods yes , grinning so hard it hurts . Well , here she goes , Captain says and reaches forward  | to click on the strange machine before them , a small fishbowl embedded in a dark wooden box with knobs . They wait silently in the near-darkness . Each time Captain takes another pull from his pint , Jimbo drinks from his Coke . Finally , from the dark depths of the embedded fishbowl an asterisk of light flickers . What the hell , soldierboy , Captain says , laughing , why not sit on your old man 's lap for this big event  --  Jimbo clutches his Mars bar and Coke as he is lifted suddenly through the air and plopped roughly on Captain 's knee . Television , soldierboy ! Captain says , laughing , and bounces Jimbo up and down on his knee . The Coke is Jimbo 's third of the special evening and his bladder aches as Captain bounces him . Suddenly the asterisk explodes into a dazzling starburst of silver light . As the images , shapes , and finally faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bright aquariums at Murphy 's Five-and-Dime . He thinks of the fish , usually angelfish and goldfish , darting like little pieces of light about the bright aquariums : aquariums whose sides ' thick glass was like a lens which made everything inside seem slightly larger than it actually was and which rarefied the green of the flowing plants and the cool colors of the pebbles , and sometimes a fish would swim up close to one of the sides and hover there , pressing its face near the glass as though it wanted to get a real good look out . The phone is ringing . The phone rings and rings . For a moment Jimbo does not know where he is . He has been dreaming that the back room of the appliance store is actually the inside of a set , a radio , or perhaps even a teevee set , and that the humming appliances are tubes and speaker coils and amplifiers and all those other mysterious electrical parts which magically weave the words , the pictures , out of the thin haunted air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones thin and silvery as filament , the current of his blood electric with flowing images . The phone is ringing . Jimbo opens his eyes and blinks for a moment in confusion . The picture on the small teevee screen is rolling slowly . Jimbo realizes where he is and in the next moment realizes he is still  | sitting straddled on Captain 's leg . Then , in the next moment , Jimbo realizes in horror that he has pissed his pants . He glances up at Captain 's face . Captain 's chin rests on his chest and his mouth hangs partly open . He is snoring loudly . Jimbo slides off Captain 's leg . There is a large , dark , wet stain on Captain 's pants . Oh no , Jimbo thinks and immediately begins shivering . He pounds his head with his fists . Oh no oh no please oh no please , Jimbo screams inside his head . The phone is ringing . Captain wakes suddenly with a start . What ? Captain mumbles . What ? He looks around . He puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The phone is ringing . What the hell ? Captain says and slowly pushes himself up . Who the hell ? The ringing phone is over on the desk beneath the lamp . Captain nearly stumbles twice as he walks stiffly across the room . Hello . Hello . Who ? Oh . Oh yes . Uncle Bob . Yes . No , sir . Well , I had some stuff to do . I had . . . Well , Uncle Bob , I did n't see any harm . No , I 'm not , sir . Not a drop . She did ? Well , sir , that 's not . . . What ? No , I 'm not . Not the least goddamn bit . Well , damn it , I did n't see any harm . Well , she had no goddamn right . . . What ? Well , I 'll have you know I 'm going to buy the goddamn set ! That 's right . Tomorrow . Yes , by God . You damn right I can . Yes . OK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , I realize . . . I said I 'm sorry now . . . What ? Yes , Uncle Bob . I said yes . Yes , sir . Good night , Uncle Bob . Yes . I will . Good night . Yes , sir . Yes , good night . That two-bit goddamn bitch whore ! Captain yells as he slams the receiver down . Jesus goddamn fucking Christ ! Jimbo has never heard Captain curse like this before . Not these words . Jimbo stands shivering in the near-darkness by the boxes , his legs spread wide apart as if he is straddling an invisible saddle , his hands gripping his wet crotch , gripping , pushing , as though he is trying to rub the awful fluid back into his awful flesh where it belongs . Bracing himself often on boxes and appliances , Captain walks slowly back across the room . He is shaking his head and muttering . For a few moments , weaving slightly , he stands  | quietly looking at the rolling teevee . Then he looks suddenly at Jimbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop shivering . Can you beat that ? Captain says to Jimbo . She went and called Uncle Bob . She called Uncle Bob and leaked to him we were down here watching the new teevee set . Now why in the world ? Why in the goddamn world ? Captain shakes his head and looks back to the teevee set . Why in the world ? he mumbles . Why in the world ? For a few moments he just stands there in the near-darkness quietly shaking his head . Then , suddenly , he reaches out , roughing Jimbo 's hair , and almost yelling says : Well , by God , soldierboy , we just bought ourselves a goddamn dandy teevee set ! Now how 's them apples ! Captain laughs and laughs until tears run down his face . He sits down on a box finally and holds his face in his hands . For a long time he just sits there like that . After a while he looks up slowly and gazes about . His eyes are wet and shining in the teevee 's light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 le burps and then begins to faintly hiccup . The paper-bagged pint bottle is lying on its side on a nearby boxtop . Captain picks it up and holding it before his face as though he expects to see through the paper bag shakes it . He puts the bottle to his lips and throwing back his head polishes off whatever is left . Where 's the bottle cap ? Captain mumbles , glancing about . Where 's the cap ? Jimbo does n't say anything . You seen the bottle cap anywhere ? Captain mumbles and awkwardly gets down on his hands and knees . He begins to slowly scoot about , pinning his hands over the dark floor . You seen the bottle cap anywhere , soldierboy ? Captain mumbles vaguely several times as he crawls around the dark floor among the boxes and appliances searching . Jimbo does n't say anything . Jimbo stands shivering in the light of the teevee , pressing his balled fists into his wet crotch. here it is ! Captain says at last . Here it is , by God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugger was here by this box all the damn time . Captain stands up stiffly and with a flourish of gestures screws the cap on the bottle , then puts it in his suitco a is side pocket . All set , Captain says , chuckling , and winks at  | Jimbo . You and me and our own teevee ! Brand-new teevee ! Bound to be the first folks in this goddamn hick town to have one . Now you 'll really be a big shot with your little pals . You 'll be hero of the block . You 'll be boss of teevee . Captain of teevee ! Just wait till she gets a load of teevee . Talk about sin ! Jesus H. Christ ! Captain starts laughing again . He laughs until he chokes . He pulls his handkerchief from his back pocket and almost stuffs it in his mouth to smother the coughs . Whew , Captain says at last , wiping his face with the handkerchief . Whew , soldierboy . He puts the handkerchief away . Then , at last , Captain makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pats his wet pants leg . What in the world ? He pats at the stain , then sniffs his fingers . He pats and pinches and tugs lightly at the stain and then sniffs his fingers again . Jimbo locks his eyes on the rolling teevee . A rippling American flag fills up the screen and the Star-Spangled Banner is being played . Oh say , can you see , Jimbo sings to himself , concentrating totally on the song 's words , filling his mind with their images . By the dawn 's early light . Bombs bursting in air . I must have spilled my bourbon all over myself , Captain says . Look at the mess I made on myself . Jimbo glances at him . Captain is pinching the wet cloth away from his skin with his thumb and forefinger . He is grinning broadly . Accidents will happen , right , soldierboy ? he says , chuckling . Even to the best of soldierboys . Hey , there , you did n't spill any of your Coke , did you ? he asks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag on the teevee . Blood . That 's what Jimbo has a sudden thought of , almost like a wish . That the dark stain was blood . Blood from a wound in Captain 's leg . A war wound . Like the war wound Captain had told Jimbo about tonight for the first time and had even lifted his shirt to show Jimbo the jagged scar on his side . Shrapnel , Captain had said and asked Jimbo if he wanted to touch it . No , Jimbo had shaken his head shyly . Oh , go on , soldierboy , Captain had said , go on . For luck , he added . In the teevee 's polar light Captain 's flesh had looked as pale as a fish belly and the wide , slightly puffed scar line was purple . Here , for luck , Captain said . He tookJimbo 's hand  | and began tracing its forefinger along the thin , hard , crooked ridge of flesh . Jimbo tried to jerk away . Captain grabbed his hand and pressed it firmly palm flat against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , laughing , then had launched into another war story . It seemed no matter what had been on the teevee set that night something would occur to remind Captain of an incident of his army days and he had told one war story after another , until at last his stories blurred , cross-faded strangely in Jimbo 's sleepy mind with television . No , not you , Captain says , lightly cuffing Jimbo 's head . You would n't spill any of that good old Coke now , would you ? No , I went and spilled my goddamn bourbon all over me , that 's what happened . And you know , son , it 's probably for the best , by God . If I 'd have drunk it all I might have gotten right down shitfaced . Captain laughs , then , noticing the teevee , says , Hey , soldierboy , that is the flag of the good old U.S. of A. on teevee . Captain tries to adjust the rolling picture but can not . Damn , he mumbles . He turns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snapping to attention . He smartly salutes the teevee 's rolling signoff . Hey there , soldierboy , attention ! Captain calls out like an order over the blaring bombs bursting teevee signoff . Jimbo snaps to rigid attention and salutes just as he has been drilled to do . Drilled to do , drilled just as he has been drilled how to march correctly , how to left-face , right-face , how to about-face , so that when he does this for visitors perfectly , Captain barking the orders proudly , they always laugh and laugh and comment on what a smart and cute little soldierboy he is.  | For his tenth birthday Jimbo 's parents gave him the best gift he had ever in his life received . His mother had been well enough to work again in her sister Garnet 's beauty parlor and Captain had not only had a good year at the appliance store but had also done well on his moonlight job for the Paramount Collection Agency . They had splurged and bought Jimbo a small Sears , Roebuck movie projector , something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , years . Along with it came several short silent films , things like Woody Woodpecker cartoons and Hopalong Cassidy westerns . Jimbo played them again and again , projecting the magic light against the wall of his darkened bedroom for hours sometimes , often until the machine seemed almost to glow . The small bright rectangle became like a strange window for Jimbo , through which he could watch Hopalong Cassidy , dressed all in black , wearing two shining silvery guns , ride his huge white stallion silently across a luminous western world completely at Jimbo 's will . Jimbo found that if he messed around with the projector he could slow the West down or speed it up . He could stop the West cold . He could make the West run backward , the strangest trick of all , with smoke returning like imploding ghosts to gun barrels and dead men falling upward alive into the movies again . Also , he  | found that if he became weary of the movie he could use the projected light to make hand shadows on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of strange creatures , who could eat their way across the western movie at their leisure . Over the years Jimbo had never forgotten how to use the projector correctly . He had never tired of it , ever . He got twenty bucks for the thing . He got a half-dollar each for his twenty white mice and five for the two mousemazes he had built . He sold off his elaborate chemistry set , with all of its gleaming flasks and delicate glass tubing , which when arranged for an experiment looked like some strange miniature shining city of the future . He sold his microscope and his exotic collection of stained slides . He sold the radio he had built whose vacuum tubes he had so often sat softly fondling while thinking strangely of eggs . Finally the telescope . It was a four-inch reflector he had built alone , gently polishing the curved surface of its mirror for weeks , weeks , until it could reflect at last galaxies glowing from even deep space . From a clay plateau on a hilltop near his home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialing in the seas of the moon , Saturn 's rings , the red moons of Mars : dialing in starry circles of the night sky like celestial teevee channels . Jimbo got thirty bucks for the thing . Still there was n't enough money for the only ring in the whole wide world . Jimbo would lie awake at night in his dark bedroom trying to think of something else to forsake . But there was nothing else . Now this was that summer of strange dreams when Jimbo had begun to make the silver cones , the magic transformers , after having read that story in Fate magazine ( limbo 's favorite magazine ) about how this sensitive , misunderstood , fired L.A. highschool science teacher had stumbled onto a surefire , simple way to tap in on those fields and flows of ghost energies which haunt the world together . Silver cones , shaped from cardboard and covered carefully with tinfoil , which after removing the plastic model fighter planes Jimbo had hung from  | his bedroom ceiling , their points focused evenly upon his pillow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . One morning Jimbo woke up unusually refreshed from the strange dreams and he discovered that they had left him with a bright idea . The dreams that night had been dreams of gangsters , of jobs and sbootouts and getaways and of gangster deaths . Gangsters take what they need , Jimbo thought , and while they live they live sleek . And gangsters blaze away at death not easily vanishing . Hell , why not become a gangster ? Jimbo thought and yawned and laughed . An outlaw . A desperado . Just like in the movies . Jimbo had long before guessed he could live his life like a movie , and as its star he could become always just what he imagined he was . He did n't have much gangster experience though . Ever since he had become Cool he had been a wildass all right , but he had never been much of a thief . Of course he had shoplifted a little , like that beautiful yo-yo , glossy black with rhinestone stars on both sides . And he had thieved Trojans from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried in his wallet , their imprints clear through the smooth leather . Not much experience , but he was young and quite willing to learn the trade . From now on he would watch gangster movies sincerely . He would get all the gangster lingo down cold . From that moment on , Jimbo decided , grinning , yawning , stretching in the early morning sunlight , he would plan how to raise the rest of the four hundred bucks for the only ring in the whole wide world in terms of jobs . So you do n't have any idea about what happened to your movie projector ? Captain asks Jimbo in one of his favorite Captain of the Second World War voices , the sort of tough but understanding one , a voice great for talking the frightened punk private out of going over the hill . Your mom and me have to make a lot of sacrifices , son , to get you a swell gift like that movie projector . Do you have any idea how long I have to moonlight to afford to get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where it is , Jimbo says , hating the whine in his voice . Anyway , you gave me that old thing over six years ago . That , son , is not the goddamn point at hand , Captain says , his voice now one perfect for forced marches through winter woods . Jimbo 's family is sitting around the dinner table , eating , at his mother 's insistence , by candlelight . Something they do often , for , as Jimbo 's mother points out , just because they are n't as filthy rich as some folks does n't mean they ca n't show some class . Tonight by candlelight they are eating waffles . And your mom says that the projector is n't the only goddamn thing missing from around this house , Captain says , drinking from his water glass of scotch and milk and leveling leis eyes on Jimbo 's face . Jimbo averts his eyes from Captain 's . He glances at his mother . In the soft candlelight the gauntness of her face is n't so apparent . Her face looks almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her plate where she worries bits of waffle about in the syrup . Screw her , Jimbo thinks . Fucking snooping my room again . Like the last time when she had discovered his Playboy magazines . Un-Christian magazines , she had declared and burned them with great ceremony out back in the barbecue pit . But Jimbo could remember her otherwise . Vaguely now . Always , it seemed , more and more vaguely . Memories of being rocked and sung to , of having his ears tickled with a bobby pin for hours it seemed ; memories of sitting at the kitchen table together whole evenings sometimes , listening to their favorite radio shows , or sometimes she would just talk about their plans together of days-long train rides west to Hollywood where she would be discovered in a drugstore and break into showbiz and become overnight a star , and filthy rich beyond belief they would live in a hilltop mansion with walls of gleaming glass and a swimming pool , its water California sky blue and heated , and he could have a pony with a silvertrimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west to Hollywood . Instead they moved in with Garnet , Jim- bo 's mom 's older sister , to wait for Jimbo 's old man to wrap up the war and return home like a parade . And then Jimbo 's memories , still vague , were of his mom and Garnet and of Garnet 's friends sitting around the kitchen table at night drinking from quart bottles of beer and laughing : memories of strange voices through closed doors and laughing and of streams of new uncles until that strange day of salvation . It was on a cold rainy day in December and I had myself a case of the sniffles , Jimbo 's mom would tell when remembering that distant afternoon of salvation at Ketchum 's Funeral Home . Her sister Garnet 's beauty parlor was contracted at that time by Ketchum 's to fix the final hairdos of corpses being prettied for viewing and Jimbo 's mom was there that afternoon alone working on old Miss Lawson 's hair . I remember I was thinking about your dad , Jimbo 's mom would tell , declaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a letter from him in a couple of weeks and she knew from the . papers that heavy fighting was going on in his theatre . She was worried that maybe he had n't received the nice Christmas presents she had mailed . She was feeling sort of tired and blue while she worked slowly on old Miss Lawson 's hair . I remember it perfectly , she would tell . I was just pinning a big curl by old Miss Lawson 's right ear and Bing Crosby was singing I 'm Dreaming of a White Christmas on the radio when suddenly she sat up . Old Miss Lawson just sat up as big as you please like she had totally forgotten she was dead . I mean I have heard of dead bodies floating up in water before but never in thin air . I must have hit my head on the table when I fainted for I went into sort of a coma or a trance or something and I did n't wake up until the next afternoon home safe in my own bed . But from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as sure as breathing that she had had a religious experience , a signal from God . God would n't just go around terrifying a body like that for no good reason . Jimbo 's mom just knew that God had picked her out special . She had been waiting her entire life to be picked out somehow , to be made special , and she had never lost faith in its eventually  | coming to pass . Now it had and she was saved by it . She was reborn . And do n't ask me how I knew , Jimbo 's mom would tell in her hushed , religious voice , but somehow deep in my heart I was sure that old Miss Lawson 's corpse sitting up the way it did was a special signal direct from God to me that the Allies were destined to win the Second World War and that your dad would come home safe and sound and a hero to boot . They went religiously then , Jimbo and his mom , every Saturday evening to the movies to witness the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the weekly newsreels , being won as surely as a serial . Outplotted again and again by the cunning and courage of Hollywood , German generals , cast as cartoons , goose-stomped their monocles in rage . With whole rising-sun battalions being beaten by handfuls of Seabees with bulldozers , Japs jabbered more and more hysterically and began dive-bombing their funny little yellow cartoon Zeros splat against the miraculous metal of American ships , vanishing to no avail . Old Miss Lawson 's rising corpse was but the first of many signals Jimbo 's mom was to discover and identify over the years , including the most recent , when one morning just six months earlier Jimbo had trotted down for breakfast to find her sitting quietly alone at the kitchen table , an ashtray of smoldering stubs before her , the radio softly humming gospel songs . I do n't think I 'll get around to cooking up breakfast this morning , she had said , her voice hushed , a strange tight smile on her lips , and her eyes wide and bright . Terrific , Jimbo said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with one of the hymns , then after a few moments said : You know , I had wonderful , wonderful dreams all night long that our Lord Jesus came back to earth and walked among us again making miracles right and left . Here we go , Jimbo thought , scanning the refrigerator shelves , amen city . Yes indeedy , Jimbo 's mom said , Jesus touched all the lame and the blind and all the sick and He cured them . There was no pain nor misery anymore . Nobody had to die anymore . And I just  | know deep in my heart it 's going to come to pass soon . Because I got me a signal , Jimbo 's mom said , turning her face toward him , its creamed skin glistening in the bright overhead light . You know , this morning when I took my bath I discovered a lump . Well , what about it , son ? Captain asks , and except for the low drone from the teevee in the living room , everything falls silent . Things just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with some answers . Jimbo looks at Captain 's huge hands , at the thick fingers enfolding the water glass of scotch and milk . He remembers having heard somewhere that big fingers meant big dicks and for a moment , in spite of himself , he wonders . Jesus , but he is a big bastard , Jimbo thinks , sizing his old man up , as he does at least once every single day of his life . And goddamn if he is n't just like everyone says a deadringer for fucking John Wayne . Well , son , answers , Captain says in his firm but polite Captain of the Second World War interrogating a Nazi officer voice . I do n't have any answers , Jimbo says . Things just get lost sometimes . But they always turn up . Anyway , why do I always get blamed for things vanishing around here ? Jimbo 's mother 's fork , spearing minced waffle , clinks china . Pitched battle noises flare up from the teevee in the living room : shouts , exploding shells , machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can see the image of the teevee screen reflected like some strange low moon in the left bottom corner of the living room 's picture window , the battle raging across its ghostly surface . Captain carefully forks another waffle from the platter and butters it slowly , the movements of his huge hands precise . Jimbo is fascinated , as always , by the strange grace , the delicate touch , of Captain 's powerful , frightening hands . Jimbo thinks of Captain 's hobby , his miniature armies of tiny toy soldiers , with all the small features of the faces , all the details of the uniforms , so exact : all the bright  | colors so cleanly painted , so painstakingly perfect . Those huge hands , Jimbo thinks . Big dicks . Big dicks . The candlelight glistens like liquid on the butter knife , its motions , and on Captain 's wide gold wedding band . Small moons of candle flame are gathered in the thick centers of Captain 's glasses and Jimbo worries . He always worries when lie ca n't see Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the liquid spreading thickly , evenly , to the waffle 's edges , stopping there , a perfect puddle . Captain is srniling faintly . He is smiling his tightly grim smile , the most dangerous of all . Jimbo 's stomach knots with fear . He has a sudden urge to swirl from the table and run . Run for his life . fie remembers suddenly that long-ago day he failed at fishing . Tfiat fearful day he could not touch the silvery form flopping to death in the deep grass . You have to snap its neck , Captain had told him . So it wo n't suffer too much . So it wo n't have to drown in the air . Could not . Could not meet the eyes , the fish eyes , Captain 's . Captain had had nothing but contempt for him , had even hated him at that moment , Jimbo had more tli:in suspected as he watched Captain pick up the still twitching trout and walk grimly toward him . It ca n't hurt you , Captain had said . It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said do it ! Goddamn girl ! Jimbo swirled to run but Captain caught him by the back of his shirt . Captain cupped the back of Jimbo 's head and neck in one of his huge hands and with the other slowly rubbed the t rout over Jimbo 's face , until at last the fish hung limp and dripping . Jimbo is being held up like a fish . His mouth feels torn . A tliumb stuffs a gill . Fingers burn scales . Perhaps he is dreaming ; . Should he be frightened ? Actually , he is numb and more wes these things than feels them . No , he only sees them . He does not feel them at all . It is a dream . It is the old fish dream , a dream he has had often since that day he failed at fishing . The pressure is gentle , a gentle squeezing . But this is not the dah dream . It is his foot , his right foot . But is he asleep ? His  | right foot is being held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is warm in a huge hand . Jimbo blinks his eyes in the darkness . The dark form sitting on the bed beside him is framed in the hall light coming through the open door . Soldierboy , the dark form whispers . Jimbo can smell whiskey . The warm hand holding his foot is damp . Soldierboy , you awake ? Yes , sir , Jimbo nods in the darkness . You want to camp out tonight , soldierboy ? the form whispers . Yes , yes , sir , Jimbo says and sits up . Jimbo rubs his eyes in the bright hall light as he follows the slightly weaving Captain toward the kitchen . Camping out ! Hot dog ! It had been a long time since Captain had asked him to camp out . Maybe everything was all right now . Maybe it did n't matter that he had failed again . Failed today at the Dreamland Swimming Pool . Failed this time at swimming . Maybe it was all right now . Captain had gotten him up , right ? And Captain had asked him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go to summer camp after all . Maybe swimming would not matter now . Uncle Boomer is sitting at the kitchen table . His face is very pale in the bright overhead light and there are deep shadows under his eyes and in the hollows of his cheeks . He is wearing his old , battered gray fedora tilted back on his head as always and as always a cigarette dangles from the corner of his mouth . With his fedora and his thin black mustache , Boomer looks , to Jimbo , like that teevee detective , Boston Blackie . Jimbo wishes he had a fedora and a thin black mustache . Jimbo wishes he was a teevee detective . He will be someday all right . Someday . Anyway , Boomer sure does n't look like an undertaker , which is what he is . Worm pies , Boomer always says , that 's my business . Worm pies . Hello , squirt , Boomer says to Jimbo in his deep , froggy voice , the source of his nickname . Jimbo grins at him . Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen table . Jimbo blinks , then rubs his eyes . Jimbo stares at the snow-piled tabletop . No , it 's not snow , Jimbo realizes , squinting his eyes . No , it 's sugar , he realizes , spotting the opened sugar canister  | at the table 's edge . Sugar ? Two , maybe three pounds of sugar , white and sparkling in the bright light , spread out over the tabletop , shaped into little rolling hills with finger tracks traced like small roads through them . Damn , Captain says . Jimbo glances up at Captain 's looming , weaving form at the end of the table . I went to wake up my soldierboy and I clean forgot to relieve myself , Captain says . You forgot to go potty ? Boomer says and pours a water glass dearly full from a bottle in a paper bag . Yes . Yes , I did . I clean forgot to drain my hog , Captain says and walks unsteadily back toward the hallway . Boomer chuckles and takes a long drink from the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then puts his finger iii his mouth . How does it taste , squirt ? Boomer asks and winks one of his droopy-lidded , always sleepy-looking eyes . Sweet . Like sugar , squirt yourself , Jimbo says . Like sugar ! You 're kidding , squirt , Boomer says , taking : mother drink . It should taste like cheese . It should taste like the moon . That 's a lunar landscape you 're nibbling at , squirt . The man-in-the-moon 's cheeks . What 's that mean , squirt yourself ? Jimbo says , tracing a finger around the sugar 's edge . Does n't mean a thing , squirt , Boomer says and winks again . I do n't mean to confuse you . I 'm pulling your leg actually . Actually that 's the Second World War you 're tasting there , squirt . Actually that 's your basic Battle of the Bulge you 're calling sweet . What 's that mean ? You 're just talking silly . ' Cause you 're drunk . And Daddy 's drunk too . Why you 're not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chuckles . Sometimes you 're the one that 's dumb , Jimbo says . Captain walks back into the kitchen and turning a chair U  | around from the table straddles it . His thick glasses are steamy about their edges and tufts of hair are plastered against his damp forehead . He rolls a toothpick about in his mouth and for a time just sits there staring at the sugar on the tabletop . Jimbo stares at the sugar also . The moon , Jimbo thinks . The man-in-the-moon . A sugar moon . A sugar manin-the-moon . Do I look like a worried man , Boomerboy ? Captain finally says , squinting his eyes at Boomer . Just because I piss bright red . Are you a worried man ? Boomer says , polishing off his drink and pouring another . Not me , Boomerboy . Just because I piss blood . Why would pissing blood bother an old warhorse like me , Boomerboy ? You 're right . It should n't . Just a goddamn leaking war wound probably . Right , Boomerboy . And by God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and blue , Boomerboy . When I piss it 's like a goddamn salute . No , Boomer says . Sorry but you 're wrong there , Cap . Red 's a commie color . You piss commie . Smile when you say that , Captain says . Boomer flashes his small yellow teeth . Check , Captain says and holds up his glass . Check , Boomer says and clinks his glass against Captain 's and they both toss their drinks down . Boomer pours them both another drink and for a time they just sit there silently sipping and staring at the table . Captain , almost absently , begins smoothing the small hills of sugar and retracing the little roads , the sugar dimpling faintly in the wake of his moving finger . Jimbo intently watches the slow movement of Captain 's huge , hairy hands as they gently shape and reshape the sugar . A wooden kitchen match is stuck blue tip up like a small flapless pole near the sugar 's center , and it occurs to Jimbo , as he watches Captain 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills , the roads , around this match , that the match is the center of it all . It occurs to jimbo  | that the match is the Captain , and he has a sudden crazy picture of the Captain standing knee-deep in sugar wearing a strange blue helmet . Yes , sir , Captain says , they thought they were being smart when they split the goddamn column . Captain takes the toothpick from his mouth and flicks it toward the garbage pail under the sink . With his forefingers Captain carefully traces two lines that circle the bottom of a sugar hill toward the match . Suddenly he flicks little sprays of sugar like small explosions . They thought they were cute until we nailed their asses . Captain laughs and takes the match from the sugar and puts it between his teeth . Right , soldierboy ? Captain says and covers the top of Jimbo 's head with his huge hand like a helmet . They thought they were cute , did n't they ? Captain says and shakes Jimbo 's head . Hey , soldierboy , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , siree ! Old soldierboy here 's heading for old Camp Six Nations a week from Saturday . Get him ready for old Greenbrier Military someday . Got your heart set on it , right , soldierboy ? Yes , sir , Jimbo says . Yes , siree . Old soldierboy here 's been getting all set for old Camp Six Nations . We 've been getting ready for weeks . Getting in shape . Practicing everything . Got him batting and fielding like a Cincinnati Red . Like old Gus Bell or Ted the K. Even been going out to the driving range a few evenings a week . Listen , the kid just might make another Slammin ' Sammy someday . Had a little trouble with the swimming over at the Dreamland Pool today though . But we 'll get it licked . He 'll be swimming like a fish by the time he heads for camp . Right , soldierboy ? Yes , sir , Jimbo says . Swimming like a fish you say , Boomer says . Like a goddamn fish , Captain says . Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , siree . Soldierboy , how 's about I go get things set up ? Captain says and polishes off his drink . He rises heavily to his feet . Boomer , you stick around , buddy . I 'm just going down to the shelter it  | and get old soldierboy 's cot ready . While I can still crawl , Captain says and laughs and walks unsteadily over to the basement door . He stomps heavily down the basement steps . Swim like a fish , eh ? Boomer says and chuckles . I 'll probably drown first , Jimbo says and flicks at the sugar with a finger . Then you 'll be one of my customers , squirt . A soaked squirt worm pie . Who cares ? Jimbo says . Is this a private party ? Jimbo 's mother says . She is standing in the hall doorway . Her blond hair is rolled up in curlers and her face is shiny with cold cream . No , come on in , my dear , Boomer says . You do n't need a ticket for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little man ? she asks Jimbo . As she walks toward the table she clutches the top of her blue quilted robe together tightly with both hands . Do you have any blessed idea what time of night it is , little man ? Dad got me up , Jimbo says and flicks at the sugar . We 're going to camp out together . He 's down in the shelter fixing my cot . Oh , that 's peachy . Oh my word , what in heaven 's name is this mess ? she says and bends over the table squinting her eyes at the sugar . That mess is your basic Second World War , Boomer says . You remember . Boom boom . Bang bang . Do n't you recognize a basic Battle of the Bulge mess when you see one , my dear ? I do n't believe it . I just do n't believe it , she says , shaking her head slowly . The sad , tired look comes over her face , the lines around her mouth deepen , and her eyes get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she says . Well , just how far gone is our Captain tonight ? No more than half , Boomer says . About like me . under the edge of dreamland 's deep end 61 .  | the table and begins to scrape the sugar into it . Boomer stands tap and helps her . Jimbo scoots his chair away from the table and just watches as the little sugar hills and roads disappear . He feels vaguely sad . Well , so how have you been , Bob ? It 's been a spell since you 've been around here , Jimbo 's mother says . Ca n't complain . Business is brisk , Boomer says . He carefully scrapes the last of the sugar off the table into the canister which Jimbo 's mother now holds with both hands . Worm pies f6rever , he says and sits back down . How 's it been with you , . June ? I stay busy with my church work , she says . She puts the canister on a shelf over the sink , then returns to the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface . Still Jesus , eh ? Boomer says and raises his glass toward her . Well , here 's to you two . You never did understand , she says . She stops wiping the table and stands there staring at Boomer . You never really tried , did you , Bob ? Wrong , Boomer says and drains his glass . You 're the party wlto never tried . When Captain calls for him Jimbo jumps up from the table . His mother glares at him and he looks away . He walks eyes owncast slowly over to the basement door . He noisily hops own the basement stairs two at a time . Such a nice full basement , warm enough in winter , cool enough in summer . But no shelves of jellies and jams , no rows and rows of mason jars of green beans will you find in this basement ; and no boxes or barrels or trunks or old furniture 11 you find stored along its walls or stacked in its corners . ' There is room only for Captain 's battle tables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement and then in evict , miniature detail has lovingly landscaped with chicken wire , with papier mache , with earth and stone , the terrains of ? mous battlefields . There is a Battle of Hastings table , a Waterloo table , a Gettysburg table , and along with three other  | Second World War tables , a large Battle of the Bulge table . This is Captain 's hobby . Night after night , scotch and milk in hand , Captain descends into his basement to drink alone and play war games on his battle tables with his tiny toy soldiers for hours , hours : recharging the great charges , reretreating the great tactical retreats ; companies , legions , whole armies of tiny toy soldiers Captain cast himself , then painstakingly painted and each night breathed battlelife into , whole armies of tiny toy soldiers rising and falling and rising once again , all by Captain 's command . He could save Napoleon at Waterloo with an unexpected daring charge of confederate cavalry . He could crush the Normans at Hastings with a surprise Roman ghost legion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he pleased . Then there was the one toy soldier Captain had made special , had cast him larger than the others and had fashioned him in an elaborate , princely uniform of his own design . It was this special toy soldier of the Captain 's who always led the victors to their glory , no matter what battle of what armies of what age . For years , night after night , for hours sometimes , hidden in the dark beneath the basement steps , Jimbo would watch Captain 's intense face as he fought . I 'll turn the teevee on , soldierboy , Captain says . You can watch the late show until I get back , how 's that ? Why do n't you stay now  --  limbo asks . He sits cross-legged on the army cot Captain has spread over with a sleeping bag . Well , fellow , I 'll be right back . I just want to say goodnight to old Uncle Boomer is all . I 'll come directly back . Listen , there 's a good late show on I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's no fun being down here by myself . Why , you 're not afraid , are you ? A tough old soldierboy like you ? Afraid of the buggerman ? I 'll leave the lights on . No ! I 'm not afraid ! I just want you to stay here , that 's all . Why ca n't you stay here anyway ? dreamland 's deep end  | Now do n't you start any of that damn whining . Yes , sir . Oh hell , soldierboy . Listen , I 'll open you a Coke . How 's that ? Only do n't tell your mom , all right ? Mom 's up . She is ? She 's up with Uncle Boomer in the kitchen . She is . She and Uncle Boomer cleaned your sugar off the table . Well , listen , soldierboy , I 'll be right back . Can we use the ham radio tonight ? Sure . Damn right . We 'll call all over the goddamn place . We 'll call Cincinnati . We 'll call Hollywood , California . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell me some monster stories like you used to when we camped out when I was a little kid ? Damn right , Captain says . He gets a Coke out of the refrigerator which he opens and gives to Jimbo . I 'll scare holy liell out of both of us . I 'll tell you about the time old Count Dracula and the Wolfman teamed up to fight Frankenstein to the death in this spooky old castle . And some spook stories ? And some spaceman stories ? Damn right , soldierboy . I 'll tell you about the time some moon spook tried to invade town . And some army stories ? Army stories ? Army stories ! Hey , soldierboy , just who the hall do you think fought off the moon spooks ? The good old U.S.A. Army , that 's who . Do I have to go swimming anymore , Dad ? Captain walks over and clicks on the teevee . He stands there beside it until its screen lights up , then he adjusts the picture until it is steady and clear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . Looks like a cowboy movie . Yeah .  | I 'm sorry , soldierboy . Captain has to duck slightly as he passes through the shelter 's low door into the basement . Jimbo listens to Captain walk across the basement , then stomp up the stairs to the kitchen . Shit , Jimbo thinks . Shit , shit , fart , puke , damn , hell , fuck . Fuck . Double fuck . Double shit fart fuck . I wo n't go to sleep , Jimbo thinks . He shakes his head to clear it . I wo n't go to sleep before he comes back no matter what . Jimbo looks around the room . He has n't been down here for a long time . This was Captain 's room and you did not come down here unless he asked you . Captain had spent almost a year digging the room off the basement , then cinder-blocking its sides and finishing it up inside with knotty-pine walls . There was a small refrigerator in one corner and a teevee set in another . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cans and jars of food and with rows of gallon jugs of spring water . On a long table along another wall Captain had set up his ham radio outfit and on wooden racks above the table were his four favorite rifles and two shotguns . On another wall were colorful maps of the town and county and state all stuck with small red pins showing the area civil defense locations . On another wall were framed photos of General Patton and General MacArthur and of President Ike . This was the only bomb shelter in the whole county . Those commies wo n't catch me with my Pearl Harbor hog hanging out , Captain would say when he was showing someone around the basement and shelter . Captain was fully prepared for World War Three and for a long time he had been sleeping nightly down in the shelter on a rollaway bed . Jimbo hears loud voices from the kitchen , his mother 's voice , Captain 's voice . This means Uncle Boomer has left . This means Captain wo n't be back down for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks . This means Captain might not be back down until morning . Or tomorrow night . Or next week . Shit , Jimbo thinks . Shit fart fuck . Well , I wo n't go to sleep , Jimbo thinks . I do n't care how long it takes . I do n't  | care if it takes until Christmas . Until Easter . Jimbo opens his eyes wide and stares intently at the teevee . The shouting from the kitchen suddenly stops . Jimbo tiptoes from the shelter across the basement to the bottom of the stairs . The kitchen door is shut . Jimbo can hear his mom crying . She cries for a long time and no one says anything . Suddenly she shouts something and Captain shouts back . They start shouting and shouting again and someone smashes something glass . Jimbo runs back to the shelter . He slams its door and locks it from the inside , something he has been ordered never , never to do . Let him whip me , Jimbo says out loud . Who cares ? Who cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimbo thinks . Even if he wants to he ca n't . He ca n't get in . The shelter door was closed and locked and Jimbo would never open it again . Never . Never . They could beg him but he would n't open it . Please , please , they could call to him . Shit dirt fuck , he would call back . Even if World War Three started ** and commies were dropping bombs all over town . Even if moon spooks invaded town . Jimbo still would n't let them in . It was his room now . There were Cokes in the refrigerator . He laid a teevee set . He could camp out in the shelter forever . And lie would n't have to go to summer camp . And he would n't leave to worry about the deep end ever again . The shouting from the kitchen gets louder and louder . Even through the closed shelter door . Jimbo puts his hands over his ears . He shakes his head . Nothing helps . He pulls the cot over directly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full Hast . He takes the four remaining Cokes from the refrigerator iuul opens them , then sets them in a line on top of the teevee . I I e checks to make certain the shelter door is really locked , then sits on the cot with his face only inches from the blaring teevee screen so that its picture fills up all he can see . He can fi-el the teevee 's heat on his face . There is a faint crackling on Isis flesh . He squints his eyes until they water , until the cowboy 16rms fade , dissolve , become shadowy fish shapes his skin can frel . Captain took him for the first time to discover teevee . A night long ago . A hundred years ago . Jimbo shakes his head .  | He does n't want to remember things outside the shelter . He does n't want to remember Captain at all . He wants to dissolve in the teevee 's light , to be a shadowy fish form in teevee 's deep end . Let 's head for the deep end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soldierboy , Captain had said . Just jump in and swim to me , son . I 'm right here , soldierboy . Jimbo curled his toes over the pool 's edge . The deep end . He could smell chlorine . The choppy , faintly green water shivered with light . Squeals of laughter , screams , splashing , loud music blasting from the clubhouse filled the air . Jimbo shivered . He wanted more than anything to be with Captain in the deep end . Come on now , Jimbo , Captain called . I 'm right here . You 're not going to drown , damn it ! Jimbo gazed at the blue , onionshaped domes of the dressing rooms at the far end of the long pool . He wished with all of his heart that the day was over and that he was in that dressing room right now . Jimbo knew he would not drown . He knew that . He knew that . Damn it , jump ! Jump ! Captain shouted and slapped the water with a cupped hand . It sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his toes , at the deep end only inches beyond them . He felt dizzy . Jump , damn it ! Slap . Jump ! Slap . Why do n't you go on and jump , chicken ? someone from behind Jimbo said and laughed . You ai n't gon na drown , chicken . Others laughed . They were all around him . Boys . Girls . Giggles . Laughter . Jump ! Slap . Jump ! Slap . Jump , jump , jump , they began to chant along with Captain . It was not really much of a shove . More a touch , a mere pressure of fingers from someone behind him . The deep end 's water strangled into Jimbo 's throat . He chopped desperately to the deep end 's surface . He chopped choking , half blind , toward Captain . That 's it ! That 's it ! Captain called as he paddled backward in the deep end away from Jimbo . From where Jimbo is sitting he can see the image of the  | teevee screen reflected like some strange low moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture window . Well , answer me , son , Captain says . Where is your movie projector ? Where are the radios and that telescope you built ? Things do n't just vanish into thin air . They 're all my things , Jimbo says , sliding bits of waffle about on his plate , wishing those moons of candle flame were not gathered in Captain 's glasses hiding his eyes , wishing that tight , dangerous smile was not on Captain 's lips . They 're my personal business . She has no right nosing around in my room . I beg to differ , Jimbo 's mother says , tapping her lips lightly with a napkin . I have every right . I am your mother , after all . And I worry about you day and night . Here I am sick and all and I have to worry and worry about you . Honey , I do n't like those crazy books you read . I 've told you and told you . And then I find all those dirty poems you wrote about that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and disappeared . I just worry myself sick . And I am already sick enough . Bullshit ! Jimbo yells . Stay the fuck out of my room ! For a backhand it is a good blow , quick , solid , and Captain 's middle knuckle catches Jimbo high on his forehead cleanly . Jimbo falls over backward in his chair . It all seems strangely like slow motion . A series of freezeframes . A slow-motion cartoon backward fall . In less than two seconds the back of Jimbo 's head will strike the baseboard and he will be knocked cold for nearly five minutes . It is in that slow-motion moment before Jimbo 's head strikes the baseboard knocking him silly that he plans fully the last job he will need to pull to purchase the only ring in the whole wide world . Yes , Jimbo gets the bright idea to steal the Second World War and to sell it off soldier by goddamn soldier .  | Sandy Dee and Troy Donahue are french kissing behind a large rock on a secluded beach when several guys come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting some . Troy jumps up and chases after them but they run , laughing , on down the beach . When Troy returns and flops back down beside her Sandy sees he is embarrassed . She takes his hand . After a few moments of silence Sandy shyly asks Troy if he has ever been bad with a girl . No , Troy says , I guess not . As soon as Sandy calls him with the bad news Troy runs away from prep school and hitchhikes to her side . They will need money , lots of it . Sandy gives Troy her mink coat , a Christmas present from her father , to hock , and with the money Troy buys an old Plymouth for their getaway . It is their first home , they joke . They will make the perfect getaway in it all right . No one will ever find them . They have their truelove , and they will have their baby , and they will be happy forever and ever . But things just do not work out for them that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the dangerous adult night . They decide to face the music . They will confess to their parents . Troy 's father is a sad old drunk who blew his inheritance . Sandy 's mother is a bitch obsessed with the evil of sex . Troy 's mother is married currently to Sandy 's father . Hand in hand the stepbrother and stepsister confront their mutual parents . Their mutual parents  | receive the news with understanding and forgiveness . People in glass houses should n't throw stones , Sandy 's father , Troy 's stepfather , starring Richard Egan , says and they all embrace . Sandy and Troy will live on the beautiful island in the lovely cold rambling Victorian mansion among the pines . In the hideout they stand arm in arm on a cliff above the blue summer sea . The music is by Percy Faith . There are a lot of strings . Theme from a Summer Place will remain high on the cliarts for over a year and thereafter it will remain a favorite oldie-but-goodie . As they walked up the crowded aisle out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . Jimbo looked down at her and he saw she was smiling at him and that her eyes were bright and glistening . Perfect , Jimbo thought as he kissed her forehead . The movie had been perfect , perfect . For Judy to see this movie right now was perfect timing . The young and in truelove teenagers who ca n't help but go all the way and who get into trouble but everything works out wonderfully for them in the end . Jimbo could n't have asked for anything more perfect . He kissed Judy 's forehead again , then whispered to her that the movie was just lil:e them . It was their own special movie . When they reached the lobby they found Penny and Pace waiting for them by the water fountain . Judy and Penny immediately pranced off to the little girls ' room whispering excitedly . Jimbo and Pace fired up Camels and slouched against the wall . Although Pace had a face shaped like a wolf , thick lips , kinky blond hair , and about the worst case of acne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crowd to get pussy . Indeed , he and Penny had been going all the way tier over a year and because they both enjoyed talking about it everyone in town but their parents knew . Because Penny had perhaps the second worst case of acne in the whole highschool , she and Pace were even more certain than Jimbo and Judy that their love would last until the end of time . Like , what 's shaking , man ? Pace said , nodding his head and looking sheepishly at Jimbo.  | Not much , Jimbo said , wrinkling his forehead and arching his eyebrows . You still cut off , man ? Pace asked and frenchinhaled deeply . Yeah , Jimbo said . I 'm still cut off cold . Got the blue balls . Tough titty , Pace said . Tough titty . Right , Jimbo said . Well , this might help you remember how sweet it was , Pace said and waved his right hand 's middle finger under Jimbo 's nose . Thanks a lot , man , Jimbo said . You want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it ? Pace said and sniffed the finger himself . Yes , sir , that was a good year . What 's this test shit about ? Jimbo asked . Judy said Penny 's married cousin told Pennv about it . The old puffed pussy test , Pace said . It 's a bunch of crap , man . Pennv 's cousin is a real turdhead . We do that test every month . Hell , I ai n't about to knock old Penny up . I always pull the hog out , man . Always . Willpower , daddy . Willpower . The only thing I 'm going to ever knock up is old Penny 's belly button , man . But every goddamn month old Penny gets the sweats . I figured it was a bunch of crap , Jimbo said . Right , man . It does n't prove nothing , man . Except maybe that Penny 's got a nice wet pussy . Fuck , man , if I ever felt anything hard in Penny 's box I 'd figure some cat lost his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you ever did knock Penny up ? Never happen , man . Like I said I pull the hog out . An accident . What would you do ? Operation Summerplace , man . What 's that ? Like the movie tonight . You know something , old Penny has seen this goddamn movie eight times . Eight goddamn times ! Well , like the movie , man . We 'd run off and get everyone all excited . We 'd let everyone get used to the idea . Then we 'd come back and get forgiven . Penny 's old man would put me  | through law school . We 'd live happy ever after . Operation Summerplace , man . So you 'd do it ? You 'd marry her and everything ? Sure , man . Hey , I love old Penny . Like with all of my heart , man . We 'd be happy . We got a lot in common . And I mean a lot more than just liking to screw and our pimples . Dig it ? Well , what about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? Besides Frankie putting you in the hospital . Frankie ai n't putting me in any hospital , man , Jimbo said and arching his eyebrows dropped his Camel 's butt on the lobby 's carpet where he ground it in slowly . Well , what would you do ? Seriously ? Who knows ? Jimbo said and shrugged . Probably the same thing you 'd do . Your basic Operation Summerplace . It was called Snake Road and it had been falling apart for years , its narrow , chuckhole-pocked pavement twisting up through the wooded hills south of town seeming to go nowhere at all , just circling through the hills turning back and back on itself . According to the local legend , the road had lx , en started many years before by work gangs of prisoners from the state penitentiary . Later on in the 1930s it had been worked on by federal WPA laborers . Why it was started in the first place and just where it was supposed to go , no one seemed really to remember for sure , at least no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this road had been the town 's main lovers ' lane , where several generations of highschool kids had gone up to knead their love in parked cars at night . It was also the place where the even younger kids of the town went to learn their own early lessons about love : went to hide behind trees and bushes beside the road , hoping to catch a glimpse of the mystery through fogged-up car windows . It w also the place where during the past spring and early hummer someone else had taken up hiding behind trees and bushes beside the road . Someone who had been only glimpsed but who looked like your basic dirty old man , everyone who had spotted him agreed ; whose leering phantom face would f 1i  | appear suddenly at a car window , then vanish just as quickly into the darkness ; a phantom face no one could recognize , for through the fogged windows it was like a mask . The Peeker , everyone called him . The crazy , perverted Snake Road Peeker creep . Jimbo pulled the goddamn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . He switched the key in the ignition onto auxiliary so they could leave the radio playing . At least the goddamn BozoBoat had a goddamn radio . The BozoBoat : that described it perfectly all right . An old , fireengine red Plymouth station wagon with Paramount Collection Agency painted in large silver letters on its doors : and instead of a regular horn , a regular beep-beep white man 's horn , it had a huge Clarabelle-the-Clown horn bolted onto its left front fender ; a horn as loud as a siren which Captain would turn on and leave blaring when he pulled up in front of a deadbeat 's house to make a collection . You ought to see the neighbors hit the windows , Captain would tell , laughing , when I pull up and blast that goddamn horn . I know how to nail a deadbeat all right . Shame ' em . Shame ' em in front of their neighbors . Jesus , Jimbo thought . He seldom drove the BozoBoat anywhere , much less on a date with Judy . Not that Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Jimbo seldom even got near the goddamn BozoBoat if he could hell ) it , except sometimes when he came rolling home late at night and figured it was time for a BozoBoat bath : late at night , in the dark , after holding it sometimes for hours , saving up until he thought he would pop , he would piss all over the goddamn BozoBoat . Tonight , the night of the big test of all nights , Judy had not ' I been able to score one of her family 's cars and since Captain was away Jimbo had hotwired the BozoBoat . Slumped as low in the seat as he could get , Jimbo had driven back streets to pick Judy up and after the show he had refused to take her to I the Beacon Drive-In . They had come directly parking and Judy was pouting about it but shit man no way was he going to  | cruise the BozoBoat around the Beacon . Besides , Captain might get wind of it . But fuck , who cares ? Old Captain . Pecker tracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecker tracks all over the goddamn seats . Old Captain would shit a brick . Old Captain was going to shit a brick anyway . Old Captain was on the first vacation he had taken in ten years , a two-week fishing trip with a couple of old army buddies , and man , did he have a surprise or two waiting for him at home . Things had sure been easier with Captain gone all right . Stealing the Second World War right out from under Captain 's Ng nose would have been one hell of a job . Do you think we ought to roll up the windows and lock the doors ? Judy asked . She had her shoes off and she was sitting with her legs tucked up in the seat under her . Her cotton dress was pulled high on her thighs and Jimbo could see the dark lower edge of her hose . She had not let him touch her since she missed her period a month ago . Not even her breasts . They laid not even frenchkissed . Afraid of the Peeker  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - eiichinhaled deeply . I 'm just nervous . Do n't you think I can take care of you ? Where 's all that old-time confidence in the kid ? Do n't make a federal case out of it . Sorry , Jimbo said . He rolled up his window and locked the door . I 'm not really afraid , Judy said , smiling shyly . The edges of her teeth were very white in her tanned face . Not when I 'm with you . Jimbo took her hand and squeezed it . For a time they sat silently listening to the radio and looking out at the view from liieir special parking place of the town 's lights and of the hglited bridge over the dark river to Ohio . The red lights of a dio tower on the next hilltop blinked in lazy sequence . . htning bugs blinked like small hot eyes from the dark . ? y 's perfume filled the car .  | Well , honey , Jimbo said , what about this test business ? Judy folded her hands in her lap and gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cute inhaling husky voice , it 's so embarrassing . Honey , what could possibly be embarrassing between us ? We 're too close for that . We 've been as close as two people can be . Like , our love has made us close . Well , Penny 's married cousin told her about it . You have to do it with me . The test that is . Oh , this is so embarrassing ! Judy put her hands over her eyes and shook her head . Honey , for Christ 's sake . I ca n't help it if I 'm embarrassed , Judy said , a slight break in her voice . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry I 'm the way I am but I just ca n't help it . Hey , sweetheart , Jimbo said . He took Judy 's hand and kissed it . I understand . Really . It 's not your fault . You just take your time , honey , and tell me about this test the best way you can . Just do it your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand . He could feel her tongue between her lips on his skin . Her eyes were shining with tears . Well , she began with a sigh , one part of the test is to feel my breasts and see if they seem to be getting larger . I tried but I ca n't really tell if they are or not . Getting larger I mean . Judy put Jimbo 's hand to her lips again and for a few moments was silent . Well , honey , Jimbo said , what 's the rest of it ? I mean , what 's it supposed to show and all ? Well , Judy said with another small sigh , according to Penny 's married cousin the other part is to touch me . Down there . To see if that little thing is hard or not . That 's it . That 's the whole test . I still do n't get it , Jimbo said . He turned down the radio . I mean , exactly what 's the test supposed to prove ? According to Penny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger and if the little thing is hard too , then  | probably I 'm going to have a baby . I do n't know if it 's true or not but that 's what Penny 's married cousin told her . Oh , yeah . Right , Jimbo said . I 've heard about that test before . I read about it somewhere I think . Did you really ? Yeah , I 'm sure I did . Like , in the Reader 's Digest I think . Well , maybe we can tell about it then . Maybe we can find out for sure . Right . At least it 's worth a try . Yes , I guess it is . Right . We 'd better be finding out for sure as soon as possible . So we can make plans and everything if we have to . Yes , I just have to know . I 've been sick all month from worrying . This is the first time in my whole life I 've been so late . I 've prayed for I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm not pregnant . I even thought about telling it in confession . For Christ 's sake , do n't do that ! I mean , honey , a priest would run right to your parents . I mean , he 'd make you tell lliein . And , like , that would sure be the end of us . I 'm just so worried and confused about everything . Look , honey , do n't sweat it . I 'll take care of everything . Things will work out . Jitnbo opened Judy 's hand and kissed its palm . He kissed her wrist . Penny says she does n't care if she is pregnant , Judy said . She says she loves Pace and that they can work something out no putter what just as long as they 're together . That 's the way I feel about us , Jimbo said . He kissed the hiside of Judy 's elbow and then her shoulder . fenny says that they 'll run away if they have to . They 've men been making plans and things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran off to Florida but really they 're going to run off to California . There are lots of jobs in California . ' ace has even been getting California papers and checking the want ads.  | If you 're pregnant would you want to run off with me to California ? Do you still love me enough ? Of course I love you , silly . I love you more than anything in the whole wide world . Jimbo kissed Judy 's neck . Well , honey , you sure have n't shown it much lately . Like , it 's been a long time since you proved how much you love me . Please ! Judy said , pushing away from him . Please ! Please do n't start that . Not now . Please . Start what ? What the hell have I done wrong now ? Oh , you know what I mean all right . Do n't play dumb . I ca n't help the way I feel . Why make it harder for me ? I feel so guilty about everything . About my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it harder for me . Look , I know , honey , Jimbo said . He hugged Judy to him and kissed her hair . I feel the same way a lot of the time myself . I mean , you 're not the only one who has let God down . But like , we talked about all of that before we ever went all the way in the first place . Like , God is n't going to leap on someone 's chest for being in love . God understands if anyone does . He 's on our side if anyone is . I mean , God is supposed to be love itself and everything , honey . Sweetheart , like , we love each other and that 's all that matters . A stupid piece of paper is n't going to make our love any more real or deep than it is right now . I 'm sorry , Jim , but I ca n't think of it as a stupid piece of paper . You 're right . You 're right , honey . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right to be married in the eyes of the church and all . I know that . Like , it 's being respectful to God for what He has given us . It 's like a covenant with Him . You know what I mean . All I 'm saying is that God is n't going to come down on us for being young and in love . Especially since we 're going to get married for sure and everything . Do you really think God understands ? Sure He does . Like , God is no idiot . I really do love you , Jim . women moon  | And I love you , honey . And ifyou are going to have our child then we 'll work something out . We 'll go to California like Pace and Penny . I know everyone will be upset and everything but after we get married and settled somewhere and have the baby , then they 'll come around . Just like in the movie tonight . they were young and in love and they made mistakes just like us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it will for us , sweetheart . I promise . I really do love you , Jim . I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy . And I want to make you happy , babe . And I could make you happy right now if only you 'd let me . We could really make each other happy . If you 'd let things be like they were . Oh for God 's sake ! Judy cried . You just wo n't quit ! You just wo n't ! Jimbo flopped back in his seat . He quickly fired up a Camel . Judy covered her face with her hands and began to cry . Fuck this bullshit , Jimbo thought and turned up the radio . He was a goddamn human being , was n't he ? How was he supposed to handle this sort of bullshit ? I need some air , Jimbo said and got out of the car . He skimmed the door . He suddenly thought of the Peeker creep who was supposed to be prowling around Snake Road spying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . Wall , at least someone is getting his jollies , Jimbo thought and spit out into the darkness . But not if he was spying on the old BozoBoat . If the Peeker creep was spying on the old BozoBoat fie was wasting his time . That was a goddamn fact of life . limbo walked around to the front of the BozoBoat and sat up on the hood . By the dashboard light he could see Judy was still crying . Fuck it . He flicked his half-smoked Camel out into the dark , then immediately fired up another . He watched the distant lights of the cars coming across the bridge from Ohio . A warm breeze stirred the fat summer leaves on the trees arounnd the small clearing and he shivered again . Fuck it , he Thought and lay back on the still warm hood and slowly blew a series of smoke rings into the night air . The sky , cloudy jobs , 1959  | earlier in the evening , had begun to clear , and as the dark clouds shifted Jimbo could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolfman moon , Jimbo thought and shivered again . Jesus Christ , what 's wrong with me ? Old Captain Nerves of Steel with a case of the shivers . Jimbo laughed quietly . He looked over at the radio tower on the next hilltop and began blinking his eyes in sequence with its flashing lights . Jimbo slid off the hood and walked around to the back of the BozoBoat and pissed along its bumper . When he finished he ducked low and sneaked around the car . Judy had her head resting back on the seat , her face turned away from the door window . Jimbo pressed his face against the window , smudging his features on the glass . He twisted his mouth into a wide leering grin , then gently tapped on the window . Peek peek peek , he called when Judy turned to look . Judy screamed and ducked down in the seat . Honey ! Honey ! Jimbo called , trying to open her door . I 'm sorry ! Honey , I 'm sorry ! Jimbo ran around the car to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just playing a dumb joke , he said and pulled Judy to him . She shivered and pressed her face into his neck . Hey , honey , come on now . Hey , there , sweetie . Settle down . Settle down now . I 'm sorry . Really , baby . I was being dumb . Jesus , I 'm sorry . You scared me silly , Judy said . I did n't know who you were . Hey , there , Jimbo said . He lifted Judy 's chin . Hey , there . Forgive me ? Please ? Pretty please ? You can be such a brat , Judy said in her cute husky inhaling voice . I can be a bad boy , I know it well , Jimbo said and kissed her eyes . Hey , honey , listen there ! Jimbo turned up the radio . Listen to those sounds . Theme from a Summer Place . Our song coming right over the radio just like the doctor ordered . Our song . Judy kissed Jimbo 's hand . Her eyes were bright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in his John Wayne voice . He opened his cardoor. woman moon lii  | Oh , silly . No , ma'am , I reckon I insist . I reckon this here is our dance , ma'am , Jimbo said and clicked on the headlights . Come on now , ma'am , do n't tarry . Let us shake a foot while the band is cooking . Silly , I 'm barefoot , Judy said and pulled back . I 'll ruin my I new hose . You are such a nut . Nonsense , my dear , Jimbo said in his cartoon Donald Duck voice and slid out of the car . He tugged playfully at Judy 's hands . Like , it 's all soft grass , my dear . Soft as your basic baby 's ass , my little chickadee . Jimbo led Judy around to the front of the BozoBoat and they began to slowdance in the headlights . Jimbo clasped his hands in the small ofJudy 's back just above the swell of her hips and Judy clasped her hands behind jimbo 's neck and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Judy 's freshly washed fragrant hair . Jimbo could feel Judy 's breasts and thighs as she pressed tightly against him and they swayed slowly together to the song , their song , their summerplace song , on the car radio , their feet nearly motionless in the deep grass . In the headlights they were a moviecouple , incandescent and romantic perfectly . And somewhere beyond the edges of the shimmering light , somewhere out in the darkness j , where lightning bugs blinked like tiny flashbulbs , an ice cupid melted slowly bluegreen . Jimbo shut his eyes . They were in the backseat of Pace 's planed and decked and lowered midnight blue ' 49 Ford : the imaginary mass of blue Hawaii i glowed like a dim curved dream through the steamed ! ! windshield : from the speaker hooked onto the steamed left front window the ghostwave voice of Elvis Presley whispered it soft truelove surfsongs : Do you really and truly love me , Judy whispered as Jimbo slowly slid down her pedal pushers : really and truly really and truly ? she whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they were stars slowdancing on Happy Hop with everyone as their witnesses : the small red light on the gliding camera glowed like grace upon them and their love was its own program on teevee , its signals pulsing out like jobs , 1959  | light into space , becoming real in some new set forever . Yes , sir , Bebop Billy had said , our little Judy is Sweet Sixteen today . And Jimbo here has a very , very special surprise for you , sweetheart . Right , Jimbo ? And he wants to give it to you right here live on camera so you two lovebirds can share this happy moment with everyone out there in teeveeland . Right , Jimbo ? Right , Jimbo said , his lower face collapsing into smiles , and he took the only ring in the whole wide world from his sportcoat 's side pocket and taking Judy 's left hand slid it quickly onto her ring finger . Judy 's blue eyes popped wide and her mouth popped open . She held her hand up , letting the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio lights . Judy squealed and covered her face with her hands and jumped up and down . Suddenly she threw her arms around Jimbo 's neck , knocking him off balance , and they staggered backward across the slick dance floor until Jimbo regained his footing . He frantically arched his eyebrows and wrinkled his forehead . Judy covered his face with kisses . Everyone laughed and applauded . Hey , gang , Bebop Billy said , let 's dedicate this next slow number to the lovebirds and let them have the floor to themselves , OK ? The studio lights dimmed and the platter Sixteen Candles began playing . Jimbo pressed his face into Judy 's hair , his breath thick with more blondness than he had ever known . Blond was Judy 's essence . Soft blond down on her arms . Her skin . Her blond smell . Her blond ponytail , which bounced relentlessly when they bopped . Because Jimbo was tall Judy danced on tiptoe . See Judy press against Jimbo . See Judy play with Jimbo 's hair . Everyone witnessing Jimbo and Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills across the river and a warm breeze stirred the fat summer leaves on the trees around the small clearing . Jimbo opened his eyes . The song , their special summerplace song , was ending . Ugh ! Judy cried , jumping back away from Jimbo . What ? Jimbo cried . What 's wrong ? What 'd I do ? Ugh ! Ugh ! Judy cried , pointing at the grass and hopping up and down . woyinan moon  | What ? What ? I stepped on something ! Something slimy ! A snake ! I think it was a slimy snake ! Snake ! Jimbo cried and hopped backward himself . Snake ? j What goddamn snake ? Ugh ugh ugh ! Judy cried . She ran toward the BozoBoat Snake ? Jimbo said . Snakes are n't slimy , Judy . Squinting his eyes in the bright headlights , Jimbo bent over to peer into the deep grass . When Judy hit the BozoBoat 's siren Jimbo jumped straight up in the air , then stumbled backward falling into the grass . He scrambled to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're doing  --  Jimbo yelled as he jumped into the frontseat . Judy had both hands clasped over her mouth and was laughing too hard to speak . That 's really funny as shit , Jimbo said , arching his eyebrows j and firing up a Camel . Really goddamn funny , Judy . It was , Judy said , gasping . The way you jumped up and fell down . You jumped so high . You looked like a frog or something . Judy clasped her hands over her mouth again and started laughing . Oh yeah , Judy . Really goddamn funny . A million goddamn laughs . You 're a real card , Judy . Real cute , Judy . Jimbo said and frenchinhaled deeply . He clicked off the headlights . Well , you scared me first . What 's the matter anyway ? Afraid of a little biddy snake or something ? Me ? Me ? Me afraid of snakes ? Are you kidding , girl ? Are you crazy ? Of course I 'm afraid of snakes , lamebrain . I 'm scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grinned . Did I really jump like a frog ? Just exactly like a frog , Judy said , laughing . Old Captain Rebel Without a Cause hopping like a frog , Jimbo said , grinning , and slowly shook his head . Well , hey , little Miss Wiseass , did you really step on something in the grass ? Yes , now I really and truly did step on something ugh ugh , jobs , 1959  | Judy said in her cute inhaling husky voice . I cross my heart and hope to die I really and truly did step on something . Probably just a used rubber , Jimbo said . What ? A what ? Nothing , Jimbo said . Nothing . Whatever it was I scared it off no doubt . It knew better than to tangle with old Captain Badass . It crawled off in the grass to save its ass . My hero , Judy said . Damn right , Jimbo said and in several poses flexed his muscles . Judy chuckled and taking jimbo 's hand kissed it . To Know Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judy turned it up . Judy ran her tongue slowly over Jimbo 's knuckles . When the record was over Jimbo quietly said : Well , honey , what should we do ? About the test I mean . I want to do the test , Judy said , almost whispering . I just have to know for sure . Right , honey , Jimbo said . We should find out . So we can make plans and all if we have to . For a few moments Judy just sat there looking down at her hands in her lap . Slowly Judy began to unbutton the front of her dress . In the dashboard 's faint light the down of her bare tanned arms glowed golden . The only ring in the whole wide world 's diamond and heart of small perfect pearls glowed on Judy 's engagement finger . Operation Summerplace , Jimbo thought . If Judy is knocked up then it 's Operation Summerplace . And they would find their summerplace too , by God . Jimbo scooted over beside Judy and casually slid his arm around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her hands in her lap , the front of her dress open . Jimbo put his arm around her shoulders and gently drew her to him and kissed her forehead . Whatever happens , honey , Jimbo said , remember I love you . And I 'll always take care of you . Always . We 'll be together no matter what . And as long as we 're together nothing can hurt us . I love you so much . I love you too , Jim , Judy said and smiled shyly . up woyinan moon  | The moment Jimbo 's fingertips touched the smooth skin of her stomach Judy shivered . Jimbo jerked his hand away . Did I hurt you , honey ? Did I scratch you or something ? No , Judy said quietly . No , I 'm OK . Go ahead . Jimbo lifted Judy 's bra and gently took her small right breast in his hand . In the evening airJudy 's breast felt cool at first but warmed quickly as Jimbo caressed it . Besides her delicate perfume a faint scent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Jimbo took her left breast in his hand . Judy closed her eyes and leaned her head back on the seat . Can you tell yet ? Judy said , in her cute inhaling husky voice . Are they getting larger ? I ca n't tell yet , Jimbo said and moved his hand back to her right breast . Her nipples had stiffened under his fingers . Jimbo kissed her ear . Can you tell anything at all yet ? Judy asked . She opened her eyes . Not yet , Jimbo said . Well , it should n't be all that hard to tell , Judy said . Her voice quivered . She placed a hand over the back of Jimbo 's hand and held it in place . Well , honey , Jimbo said and removed his hand and sat back in the seat , actually I think they are getting larger . Now I could be wrong but I really think they are . Oh no , Judy whispered . She slowly pulled her bra down and straightened it . She started to rebutton the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lap . Honey , please do n't worry , Jimbo said and lifted her chin . Ile brushed her lips with a kiss . Please do n't worry . We 'll get married and we 'll have our squirt and everything will work out fine in the end . You 'll see . Just remember God is on our side . God is love itself . And since we 're in love that means what we have is a part of God Himself . We should thank God for what we have . He 's been so good to us . We can thank God by raising this child for the church , Judy wid . Her eyes were bright . Dig it , Jimbo said and kissed the palm of Judy 's hand . II jabs , 1959  | Yes , Judy said , if it 's a girl we 'll raise her up to be a nun . And if it 's a boy we 'll raise him up to be a priest . A priest would be great , Jimbo said and kissed Judy 's shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dig it , Jimbo said and softly kissed Judy 's neck . Why , who knows , he might even go on to get himself martyred . Boiled in the Congo . Eaten by savage niggers . Then someday get voted in as a big-shot saint . A bishop , Judy said . He might be a bishop . Or even someday a cardinal . Dig it , Jimbo said and slowly ran his tongue along the edge oQudy 's jaw . Any squirt of ours is bound to get his name up in lights . Hell , the kid might turn out to be the first pope in history who ai n't a goddamn spaghetti sucker . Oh , Jim , please , please do n't talk like that ! Judy said and pulled away from him . Hey , honey ! I 'm sorry , Jimbo said . He gently drewJudy back to him . I did n't mean anything by it . I only meant that any rug rat of ours will turn out to be a star no matter what he does . Well , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . Sometimes I think you do n't mean to convert at all . Like you promised . Sometimes I think you intend to go on believing in all that crazy , sinful reincarnation stuff forever and burn in hell for it . And Jim Stark , if you intend to burn in hell , well , then I just do n't intend to marry you at all . Even if I 'm pregnant . Oh , honey , come on . Do n't sweat it . I promise I wo n't burn in hell . I just told you how thankful we should be to God for our love . And I think raising a squirt for the church is a great idea . And let me tell you , babe , I intend to be one gung-ho , mackerel-snapping , bead-squeezing demon . No kidding , babe . Why do you talk like that then ? Like you 're making fun of everything ? I do n't mean anything by it , honey . Listen , I 'm serious when  | I say we should thank God . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I trust God , Judy said . Trust me too , honey . Please . I trust you . Well , honey , Jimbo said , I guess we best get on with the test . I guess so , Judy said . I love you , babe . I love you too . I really do . Jimbo put his hand on Judy 's knee , then moved it slowly up under her dress , his fingertips gently scraping her hose . When his hand reached the soft flesh of her upper thigh above her hose Judy parted her legs slightly . Jimbo worked his middle finger under the damp crotch of Judy 's panties and after briefly brushing her pubic hair slipped the finger into her pussy . Can you tell anything yet ? Judy asked immediately . Not yet , for Christ 's sake ! I just got it in . I mean , like , relax , sweetheart . Relax . I love you , sweetheart . I love you too , Judy said and put her head back on the seat . She shut her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was uneven . We 're so lucky , Jimbo whispered and kissed Judy 's ear . So lucky to have each other and our love . The love God has given us . I love you so much . So much . So much . Jimbo kissed Judy 's eyes , then ran his tongue along the hollows of her throat . He began using two fingers . Do you really and truly love me ? Judy whispered . You bet , Jimbo said . Everything will work out . I just know it will . I know it . I almost hope I am pregnant . Dig it , Jimbo said and began using three fingers . Judy wet Jimbo 's ear with her tongue . When Jimbo kissed her lips Judy opened her mouth and sucked his tongue into it . Judy arched her hips up slightly and squeezed Jimbo 's hand with her thighs . She put a hand overJimbo 's hand and pressed jobs , 1959  | it and french kissing deeply they slid slowly down in the seat . Jimbo lifted Judy 's bra and sucked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimbo rolled off her onto the floor . What ? Jimbo yelled . My God , what ? The window ! Judy screamed . A face ! A face was at the window ! Face ! Jimbo cried . He arched quickly up and around off the floor and seeing a face at the window fell backward onto Judy . My nose ! Judy cried . Your elbow 's on my nose ! Jimbo scrambled up off her and seeing the face again froze until he realized it was his own reflection in the glass . There 's no face , Jimbo said . What goddamn face ? There was too ! Judy cried . She pushed frantically at Jimbo trying to get her legs out from under him . There was too ! There was ! Oh , my nose . You broke my nose . I did n't see any goddamn face , Jimbo said , arching upward to let Judy slide from under him and sit up behind the steering wheel . Jimbo reached across her and clicked on the headlights . It was God , Judy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell does that mean ? God ! Jesus Christ ! God made it happen . To stop us . We were getting carried away again . And God made that horrible crazy man peek in our car to stop us from sinning again . Oh , my nose . I just know my nose is broken . Oh bullshit , Judy ! Fucking bullshit ! I almost let God down again , Judy said , crying . But He saved me . And He taught me a lesson . He punished me . He had you break my nose . Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Jimbo yelled and opened the cardoor . What are you doing ? Close that door ! He might still be out there ! I hope he is ! I 'm going to get that creep son of a bitch ! Jimbo jumped out and slammed the door . Judy quickly slid across the seat and rolled down the window . What are you doing ? Are you crazy ? Get back in this car ! I 'm going to hunt down that creep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . Someone has to do it . I guess that someone 's me . Oh , Jim , do n't be so silly . You always try to act so big . Jimbo walked slowly out around the front of the car into the headlights . He stopped and stood legs spread wide apart and looked intently into the dark trees around the small clearing . Dark clouds moved swiftly across the full moon and the wind blew into the trees , twisting their fat leaves in the headlights ' glow . Jimbo arched his eyebrows and wrinkled his forehead and took his switchblade from his windbreaker 's pocket . With an elaborate flick of his wrist he clicked the switchblade open and held it up in the headlights . Oh , creepo . Oh , creepo baby , Jimbo called out . He waved the switchblade before him . Oh , creepo baby , I got something here all for you . Come and get it , creepo baby . Jim , quit acting silly ! Judy called . Get back in this car right now ! Jimbo began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its handle . He began flipping it higher and higher , light flickering like quicksilver on its metal , until it began disappearing for moments into the darkness above the carlights . Jimbo felt light-headed , dizzy almost . Jimbo felt his eyes go away . They went away and then looked back at himself flipping the switchblade in the carlights . They looked back from the trees . When Judy hit the BozoBoat 's siren Jimbo jumped and then for a moment froze , forgetting the switchblade spinning down from the darkness above the carlights until it hit him on the head . Jesus fucking Christ ! Jimbo yelled . He clutched his head and hopped around in the grass . He could hear Judy laughing from the BozoBoat . He looked at his hands . Sure enough , there were traces of blood on his fingers . He held his fingers up in the carlights for Judy to see . You think this is funny ! he yelled . I 'm bleeding like a stuck pig and you think it 's funny ! Get back in the car ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to his head . He began kicking about in the deep grass searching for his 6 iI jobs , 1959  | switchblade . Jesus , he thought , what if it had been the fucking blade instead of the handle that drilled him . He had a sudden picture of a quivering switchblade sticking out of his bloody head . Jesus , Jimbo thought , what a joke . What a fucking cartoon . Just as Jimbo spotted his switchblade in the deep grass and reached for it Judy clicked off the carlights . Goddamn it , Judy ! Jimbo yelled . Turn those goddamn lights on ! Jimbo bent over and began feeling around in the grass where he had dropped the switchblade . Snake , he suddenly thought and jerked his hand back . Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Judy , turn those goddamn lights on ! I mean it , Judy ! Get back in the car ! Fuck her , Jimbo thought . He began kicking lightly about in the grass . He could not afford to lose another switchblade . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had shelled out ten bucks for the thing . The other two switchblades his dear old mom had discovered while searching his room for dirty poems and had tossed away . The dark clouds over the full moon suddenly parted and in the bright moonlight Jimbo spotted a gleam in the grass . He snatched the switchblade from the grass and held it up in the moonlight , looking it over carefully . He waved it screw you , sweetie in Judy 's direction , then closed it and put it back safe in his windbreaker 's pocket . Jimbo dabbed lightly at his head with the handkerchief , then looked at it closely . He was bleeding all right , no mistake about that . Please , please get back in this car ! Judy called , clicking the carlights on and off , on and off . Hey ! Jimbo yelled . He pointed to the trees down the slight slope in front of the car . I see him ! Over there ! The Peeker creep ! Right over there ! Quit that ! Judy called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got the old Peeker creep spotted , by jove ! And he 's all hairy like an ape , by jove ! Look , Judy ! Over there . Right over there . His face is all hairy , by jove ! You 're not being funny one bit ! Judy called and clicked the carlights back on . I want to leave , Jim . Please . women moon  | He 's there , by jove ! He 's right over there and he 's a hairy devil , what . Great scot , the bloke 's a wolfman ! You 're so dumb ! You 're acting like a dumb little kid . Duty calls , my pet . Duty ! God and country . A man has to do what a man has to do ! Jimbo called and saluted the moon . He whipped the switchblade out of his windbreaker 's pocket and with a flourish clicked it open and held it high in the carlights . Sing , O Singing Sword ! O Singing Switchblade ! Hi-ho , Silver , away ! Jimbo shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , charge down the slope toward the dark trees . Jim ! Jim ! Jim , please ! Please ! Jimbo ducked under the low branches of a spruce at the edge of the clearing and skidded to a stop in the underbrush . He crawled on hands and knees back up the slope to a slight depression under the spruce and flopped there on the soft needle loam and watched the BozoBoat intently . Blood pounded small explosions behind his eyes and in the hollows of his ears . OK , Judy Judy Judy , it 's your turn , baby , Jimbo thought and laughed softly . The carlights ' beams shone brightly into the trees above him . He scraped away a small patch of fallen needles and then while still watching the BozoBoat dug absently at the moist earth with the switchblade . The rich smell of the turned needles and of the moist earth filled his nose . He sniffed the tips of the three middle fingers of his left hand , then ran each finger under his nose slowly in turn and inhaled deeply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good year all right . Jimbo stabbed the switchblade into the loose earth to its handle . The wind blew suddenly up and thunder clapped overhead and Jimbo could hear rain hitting higher in the trees . He suddenly snatched the switchblade from the earth and swirled about . What the fuck was that ? Jimbo stared intently into the darkness behind him . He crouched and thrust the switchblade before him . Maybe Judy really had seen a face , he thought and shuddered . Hey , man , just cool it . Captain Nerves of Steel , man . Jimbo arched his eyebrows and wrinkled his forehead and spit out into the darkness . Well , come on , creepo , make jobs , 1959  | your move , Jimbo said aloud . Come on and get your cold bite of old Captain 's singing switchblade , creepo baby . Again . Jimbo jumped backward and fell down . He heard it again . He lay on his back and laughed . He stabbed the switchblade back into the earth . The wind . Branches in the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jimbo laughed again . Who 's afraid of the big bad wolf , the big bad wolf ? he chanted quietly . Jim . Jim . Jimbo rolled quickly onto his stomach . Judy was standing behind the BozoBoat 's driver 's side door . Leaving the door open , she slowly rounded it and gazed intently about . Jimbo could hear faint radio music . Jim . Jim , honey . Please , Jim . Judy slowly crept toward the front of the BozoBoat , tiptoeing almost , running her hand along its fender . When she reached the front she bent near the carlights and stared out their beams into the trees . Rain flicked out of the dark across the carlights and in their glow Judy 's wet face was pale . Please , honey . Are you all right ? Honey , are you OK ? When Jimbo screamed so did Judy . Jimbo screamed and screamed and thrashed wildly about in the brush . Judy screamed and tumbled backward against the cardoor , slamming it shut . Jimbo began to howl like a wolf at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scrambled into the BozoBoat . Jimbo rolled over and lay there on his back under the tree alternately laughing and howling , howling like an outlaw wolf at a full moon , imagining himself transformed in moonlight , a face of growing hair , fangs , nails for ripping : howling , howling his ancient beastheart out , a beastheart he could almost imagine remembering . When Judy hit the BozoBoat 's siren jimbo as always jumped . Jesus fucking Christ ! Jimbo shouted . I swear to God I 'm going to bust hell out of that goddamn horn ! Then Jimbo began to alternately laugh and moo , moo like a cow . Jimbo arched his eyebrows and wrinkled his forehead and mooed like James Dean did at the sirens women moon  | blaring with anger and danger and with fear from somewhere in the dark adult distance . Finally Jimbo rolled onto his stomach laughing , laughing so hard he was almost choking . He bit his fist . He pounded the ground . Then he looked up and through his tears saw Judy and was suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen anyway  --  limbo said quietly to himself . Judy had turned on the BozoBoat 's interior light and was sitting far forward with her weeping face pressed almost against the now rain-streaked windshield , and seeing her weeping face like that , so strangely shadowed , pale and dissolving , staring through water , limbo suddenly imagined her , imagined himself , imagined everything , submerged in some deep end , drowned .  | Say your life breaks down . You are only seventeen and already your life breaks down . After wearing it for only three days your girl returns the only ring in the whole wide world : a ring you have gone into a life of crime to buy for her , a life of pulling jobs  --  shoplifting , stealing spinner hubcaps , knocking over parking meters  --  a ring you stole the Second World War for , a job you are now going to pay for dearly . Keep the goddamn ring , Jimbo had told Judy . Judy had cried , cried softly . She still loved him , Judy told Jimbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still wanted more than anything in the world for them to someday marry and to have their twelve children , their six boys and six girls . But they had to be realistic about their love . God had answered her prayers . She was not pregnant after all . God had given her another chance to be good . And she was just being realistic . She knew that if they continued going steady , being together and so intense all the time , they could not keep from going all . the way again and she could not let that happen ever again until they were married . God had forgiven her and she would not let God down again . She would not be bad again until she was married and that was final . So it was best they did not let themselves get into tempting situations if you know what I mean . From now on they would always double date with couples who were not themselves going all the way . And they breaking up is hard to do  | would go only to shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never go parking . And to be really safe they would not even frenchkiss . And what 's more they should both date other people . Oh , that 's cute , Jimbo said . Well , if our love is real it will last until we can get married someday . Who do you have in mind anyway ? What old flame is waiting in the wings , Judy ? I do n't have anyone in mind . I love you . I really do . We have to be careful , that 's all . Is it good old Hutch ? My old pal old buddy Hutch Bodine ? Old college joe himself ? Is that who it is , Judy ? I do n't have Hutch or anyone in mind . God has given me another chance , that 's all . If I was really thankful I 'd become a ! I nun . Oh Jesus fucking Christ ! Do n't you talk like that ! Well , hell , keep the damn ring anyway . No . I do n't think I should . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to give it to , Judy said and put the only ring in the whole wide world in Jimbo 's hand . Well , suit yourself , babe , Jimbo said , arching his eyebrows . And by the by , babe , just to keep the old record straight , I li never intended for a fucking minute to join up with your goddamn bead-squeezing , mackerel-snapping church , dig ? I still believe in that crazy , sinful reincarnation stuff and I always will , dig ? And , babe , if you ask me the goddamn pope is queer as a three-buck bill , dig ? Say your life breaks down . You are only seventeen , it is summer before your senior year , and your life is coming down around your ears . Your old man , old Captain himself , returned over an hour ago from the first vacation he has taken in ten years , a two-week fishing trip with a couple of old army buddies , and he must have had swell luck for you could hear him happy and hooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derful trout he caught : We 're going to be gobbling trout around this old house the rest of the goddamn summer , he hooted . Gosh old Captain sure is a great fisherman . Gosh he sure is a great sport . Old Captain can take his stinking trout and stick them up his ass . Old Captain is not really lucky at all . Old Captain sure has a homecoming surprise or two waiting for him all right : just as soon as he goes down into his basement and spots his almost empty battle tables , especially his absolutely empty Battle of the Bulge table . So Jimbo lay there on his bed smoking and waiting and now and then examining the only ring in the whole wide world squeezed on his thumb tip and he was sick to his stomach . It was only a matter of time . It was only a matter of time . Jimbo smoked and waited . He looked up at the silver cones hanging from the ceiling , hanging in place of all those plastic fighter planes he once had strung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited and stared up at the silver cones and wished with all of his heart he was safely deep within one of their strange gangster dreams . Jimbo felt around under his pillow for the one soldier he had kept : Captain 's special soldier , the one who always led the victors to their glory , no matter what battle of what army of what age . Jimbo held it up and examined its elaborate , bright blue and red , silver-trimmed uniform , its silver , high-pointed , plumed helmet . Jimbo had not sold it with the rest . He could have scored a few bucks off the bozo thing all right but he did not . Maybe if he gave Captain back his special bozo soldier Captain would only break his arms and legs . Sure . Hell , Jimbo thought , he might as well keep the thing as a goddamn souvenir . His very own personal Second World War bozo hero souvenir . Jimbo stuffed the bozo soldier back under his pillow . And all for this , he thought , holding up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim light from his desk lamp across the room the ring 's diamond and surrounding heart of small perfect pearls glittered faintly . It 's not fair to you blah blah , she had said . You might find someone else you want to give it to blah blah blah . Fuck her . He should have stuffed it up her breaking up is hard to do  | ass . Stuffed it up her precious pussy . Knocked her up with the only ring in the whole wide world . Puffed her pussy with pearls . Tears suddenly flooded Jimbo 's eyes and he threw the only ring in the whole wide world against the far wall . He listened with pain as it bounced about . Well , hell , she is a fine girl , Jimbo thought . Goddamn it anyway . And he was a jerk . An asshole . That 's for sure . To give her all that punk grief . Jesus Christ . Jesus fucking Christ . Oh , well . Hell , what old Captain Boohoo needs right now is a little distraction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damn right . Like a good old whack-off . That 's what old Captain Boohoo needs all right : your good old basic whack-off . One last mythic whack-off in honor ofJudy-poo 's pussypie , by God . Jimbo stubbed out his Camel , then rolled onto his stomach and felt around under the bed for the sock . Well , here goes your basic terminal case of the hairy palms and pimples , Jimbo thought and laughed . He rolled onto his back and unzipped his jeans . It was an old athletic sock with blue and green stripes around its top and it was stiff as a corpse . Jimbo crunched it gently in his hands until it softened . Jimbo shut his eyes . Jimbo opened his eyes . The hell with this , he thought and tossed the sock back under the bed . He zipped up his jeans quickly . Jesus . What if Captain happened to come marching in about right now . Captain comes stomping in to square off with Jimbo and there Jimbo is flopping his dork . That would be cute all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly stared a hole through Jimbo 's dork . How old had he been ? Thirteen , fourteen maybe . Seventh grade , anyway . When on a dare he had put an unwrapped cherry popsicle in his homeroom teacher 's top desk drawer to melt . What a neat mess it had made . Sticky cherry juice all over everything , even gluing the grade book 's pages together . Old bitch Scott had really shit a brick all right . She 'd stomped and hooted around like crazy . And old bitch Scott had suspected Jimbo right away , of course , for although he had the highest grades of anyone in the homeroom she had his number as a troublemaker . He would never help clean the erasers and he was jobs , 1959  | always squeezing his hands together making obscene fart sounds and whenever it was his turn to lead the class in either the Lord 's Prayer or the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag he would quack them like his favorite cartoon character Donald Duck . A troublemaker for sure . So when some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popsicle in her desk drawer old bitch Scott had cackled and jabbered with hateful joy as she jerked him down the hall to the principal 's office . Jimbo had been immediately suspended for three days and sent home where he went directly to the bathroom and sat on the commode to wait . Somehow he felt that if he was sitting on the commode Captain would not immediately break his arms and legs when he got home . After all , no one walks in on someone taking a shit , Jimbo figured . Then maybe Captain would have a chance to calm down . It did not work . Captain had thrown open the bathroom door and charged in yelling and slapping at Jimbo who was in turn crying , I 'm on the commode ! I 'm on the commode ! Jimbo jumped up and with his pants down around his ankles tried vainly to hop to safety . I 'm on the commode ! Jimbo kept crying as he hopped about trying to duck under Captain 's slaps . Then suddenly Captain stopped slapping and Jimbo peeked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was staring a hole through his dork . Only then did Jimbo realize with amazement he had a hard-on . His eyes met Captain 's and they both flushed and looked quickly away . Captain turned abruptly and stalked from the bathroom . Jimbo flopped back down on the commode . He sat there on the commode and held his face in his hands . Jimmy . Jimbo jumped up off the bed . His mother was standing in the doorway . She was clutching her bathrobe to her throat . Why do n't you ever knock ? Jimmy , what in the world have you done this time ? she asked . Her eyes were wide and bright . Done ? I have n't done anything . Why do n't you ever knock anyway ? This is my room you know . breaking up is hard to do  | Well , your dad wants to see you . He says for you to come down to the shelter . What in the world did you do this time , honey ? I 've never seen him so . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't do anything I said . And I 'm not going down to his damn shelter . Well , he says for you to come down . I 've never seen him like this before . I 'm not going down there I said . I 'm busy . You best do what he says , honey . I 'm busy I said . I do n't know . I just do n't know what to think . I 've never seen him like this . Honey , you better go down . No , damn it ! I 'm busy ! I just do n't know what to think . I try and try and it does n't do a bit ofgood . I pray for you all the time . And I pray for your dad . I 'm so sickly and all and you give me nothing but more worries . The both ofyou . Well , I 'll tell your dad you wo n't come down I guess . I 've never seen him like this before , Jimbo 's mother said , shaking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door too . And how 's about knocking for a change ? Oh Jesus fucking Christ , Jimbo said aloud . He thought he was going to be sick . He felt dizzy . He had a sudden urge to crawl under the bed . He could not believe it . He held his hands up in front of his face . They were actually trembling . He shut his eyes and leaned back against the wall . Well , big bad boy , this is it , Jimbo thought . The big squareoff . Because by God , he was not going to let Captain just pound around on him this time . This time he would fight back , by God . If Captain came in swinging he would swing back . Goddamn right , Jimbo thought , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . The big squareoff . The big showdown . Jimbo suddenly pictured Captain 's huge , hairy hands , his thick , powerful fingers . More like the last showdown , Jimbo thought and smiled grimly . He leaned there against the wall with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ending of Red River , a jobs , 1959  | movie ending he had thought about a lot lately , an ending he had rerun in his mind again and again . He reran John Wayne , big as a barn , stalling through scattering cattle toward where Montgomery Clift waited in the dusty cow-town street for their big showdown . John Wayne had been like a father to Montgomery Clift , had taught him how to ride and rope and shoot and how to quickdraw with the best . John Wayne had taught Montgomery Clift everything and they had loved each other like father and son and now they were going to gun each other down like dogs in the street . Wayne thought Clift had stolen his herd of Texas longhorns but Clift had not really and when it came down to it Clift could not quickdraw against Wayne . Wayne tried to force Clift 's hand . Wayne quickdrew and scattered hot lead all about Clift , once even grazing his cheek , but Clift just would not go for his big iron . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne said and stalked right up to Cliff and punched his face . Wayne punched Clift again and again , belting him bloody all about the dusty cow-town street , until at last Clift had had enough and let fly . Clift let fly with a roundhouse haymaker right and caught big John flush on the jaw . Wayne went down like a ton of bricks with a look of surprise and , more important , pride spread on his kisser . A good one ! A haymaker right smack in the kisser . And John Wayne , John Wayne , big as a barn , big as all outdoors , went down on his ass . And of course John Wayne forgave Montgomery Clift and they loved each other like father and son once again . And to prove his love John Wayne drew the ranch 's new brand in the sand with a stick : a brand using both their names ' initials .. Blam , a roundhouse haymaker smack on John Wayne 's kisser . Jimbo kept rerunning the surprised but proud look on John Wayne 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street looking up at Clift . Blam . Blam . Pow . Socko . Jimbo danced around the room tossing lefts and rights , tossing jabs , uppercuts , crosses . Then he heard Captain 's heavy steps on the stairs and he quickly backed to the wall farthest from the door and held his breath . Jimbo listened as Captain walked heavily down the hallway breaking up is hard to do  | to the bedroom door . Jimbo could hear Captain 's heavy smoker 's rattle as he then just stood there outside the door . What the fuck is he waiting for ? Jimbo thought . Make your fucking move , cowboy . At last Captain slowly opened the door and Jimbo thought he would piss his pants . Captain just stood there framed in the hall light , his big-as-a-barn , big-as-alloutdoors body a massive shadow filling the doorway , blocking all hope of escape . I want to talk to you , soldierboy , Captain , after what seemed to Jimbo minutes , at last said in a quiet voice not of the Second World War at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhead light and Jimbo blinked in the brightness . Then Captain just stood there not speaking again . He was weaving slightly and he lightly pressed the backs of his hands against the doorframe to steady himself . Behind the thick lenses of his slightly fogged glasses his eyes looked swollen and watery and he blinked them often . Fisheyes , Jimbo suddenly thought . They made him think of bulging , filmy fish eyes staring out through the thick glass sides of some aquarium . And there was no glint , no look , in those strange fish eyes Captain could not seem to focus on Jimbo 's face : they seemed not even to reflect light , but to absorb it , suck it in , flat , lifeless . Did you have a good trip , sir ? Jimbo said at last . Where are they ? Captain said . What , sir ? Where are they ? Where 's what , sir ? Where are they , soldierboy ? I took them and sold them . You took them and sold them ? Yes , sir . You sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Bob 's Hobby Shop . But most of them I just sold around to kids . You know , just around the neighborhood .  | You sold them ? Yes , sir . Why ? I had to buy something . You had to buy something ? Yes , sir . What ? A ring . A what ? A ring , sir . A ring ? A ring for Judy . A ring for Judy ? Captain said and stepped on into the room . He shut the door behind him . Yeah , a ring for Judy , Jimbo said . It cost four hundred buckeroos . Four hundred what ? Buckeroos . Bucks . Dollars . A four-hundred-dollar ring for Judy , Captain said and walked slowly toward Jimbo . Right , Jimbo said . He clenched his fists at his sides . Captain 's head bumped a silver cone and he stopped and stared at it . He blinked his eyes . As though in slow motion Captain reached up and touched the silver cone . He stopped its spinning and then just held it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a slight tug he pulled the cone 's string loose from the ceiling . Captain turned the silver cone over and over in his huge hands , examining it intently with his wet , blinking eyes . But he 's seen them before , Jimbo . thought , remembering all the hell Captain had raised when Jimbo had first taken the plastic fighter planes down and put up the silver cones . There 's nothing new about those things . They were the same old silver cones . A fish , Jimbo suddenly thought . The silver cone looked like a small silver fish in Captain 's huge hands . As though Captain had just landed it and was getting all set to  | gut it . Jimbo pictured Captain carrying the still twitching silver cone grimly toward him . Jimbo pictured Captain slowly gibbing the still twitching silver cone over his face , until at best it hung limp and dead . Captain tossed the silver cone onto Jimbo 's bed . He looked hack at Jimbo , still blinking his wet eyes as though trying to t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light his face looked lined rind old and his shoulders were slumped like Jimbo had never seen them before . Attention ! Jimbo suddenly had an urge to yell . Shoulders back ! Belly in ! Left face right face about-face ! So you sold them ? Captain said . Except for what 's left down on the battle tables . You sold all the rest ? Yes , sir . How much money did you get for everything , Jimbo ? I do n't remember exactly . You do n't remember exactly ? No , sir . I did n't exactly keep count . You did n't exactly keep count , Captain said and rubbed his lined forehead with his hand like some strange , slow salute . Here 's the ring I bought , Jimbo said and bent to pick up the Jl only ring in the whole wide world from where he had spotted it glittering faintly on the floor . He held it up in the light . Two of its small perfect pearls were missing . Judy gave it back to me . It 's almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearls are gone . You want it , Dad ? i What , Jimbo ? The ring . You want the ring , Dad ? You can have it , Jimbo srcid and held the ring out . You can sell it and maybe get your things back . I 'm sorry , Dad . I 'm going to call your Grandma Carver , Jimbo , Captain said quietly and ran his fingers back through his hair . I 'm going to call her tonight and see if you can live with her down in I Ittndred Mines next year . You can finish up highschool down f l sere . Here , Dad , why do n't you go on and take it ? I 'll pay your expenses and she 's got plenty of room in that jobs , 1959  | old house so it will probably be all right with her . She can probably use some help around there . And I 'll send you some allowance I guess . Here , Dad , please take the ring . Please . You can sell it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want you to live here anymore , Jimbo . Hey , Dad , here 's the ring . Please , Dad . I do n't want your goddamn ring , soldierboy , Captain said and turned and walked from the room , closing the door quietly behind him . It was the night of the big sendoff . Jimbo was to take the bus the next morning to Hundred Mines to live with his grandmother . His dear old mom had spent two days washing and ironing his clothes and now he was all packed and ready to blow this burg . Here he had stolen the whole Second World War from his old man and he had gotten off scot-free . His old man had not laid a hand on him . His old man had only tossed him out on his ass but who in the fuck cared anyway ? Jimbo was bored with this burg anyway . In Hundred Mines he 'd be a big frog in a punk pond . He 'd screw every halfway clean coal miner 's daughter he could find . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burg by cruising around town with his best buddies Boots and Pace in Pace 's planed and decked and lowered midnight blue ' 49 Ford and by getting drunk as a skunk on orange-flavored sloe gin and by at long last kicking the shit out of Hutch Bodine . Jimbo , sitting at his desk , checked his watch : another hour before Pace was to pick him up . He fired up a Camel and glanced through his notebook of poems once again . Now and then he stopped to read a poem through , trying as he did to imagine Judy reading it , to imagine her sorrow , her heartache , as she realized what she had done . Jimbo put the notebook and the letter in a large already addressed envelope and sealed it . Well , that 's that , he thought and smiled . He had destroyed all other copies he had of his poems . Judy would have the only copy in the whole wide world to do with as she wished . And breaking up is hard to do  | he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could throw it in the river for all he cared . He was through with that sort of sissy shit . He would never again write another poem . There was a light knock at the door . Yeah , Jimbo said . He pushed his chair back and swung his feet up on the desk . It 's just me , Jimmy , his mother said as she opened the door and came in . I got some hankies here I forgot to pack for you . That 's what I need all right , Jimbo said , frenchinhaling deeply . Your basic snot-rags . Jimbo 's mother arranged the handkerchiefs in the open suitcase on the bed . There , that ought to hold you for a while , she said . She retied the belt of her bathrobe and then , humming softly , she walked slowly , aimlessly , around the room touching things . You know , this is a nice room . It gets that nice morning sun and all . I know , Jimbo said . Jimbo 's mother walked over to the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains , she had called them when years earlier she had made them special for Jimbo 's bedroom , made them from cloth decorated with horses ' heads . She stood there humming and staring out into the frontyard and street . God 's ways are ways of mystery , she said after a time and absently patted her cheek with long , fluttering fingers . So maybe it 's all for the best right now . What with me being ill and all . Maybe you staying with your grandma is what God thinks is best right now . I do n't know . Maybe so . Maybe . We are n't what you 'd call a happy family right now I guess . I wish we were a happy family . Maybe when I get cured things will be happier around here . I pray for it every night . Right , Jimbo said , stubbing out his Camel and immediately lighting another . Happy , happy . Just like on teevee . Like the Nelsons . Like Father Knows Best . I used to be so happy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you . And I was always so gay . So lighthearted . I was always singing and laughing . You remember the laughs we used to have ? When you were little ? You remember how we 'd 4 jobs , 1959  | sit out in the kitchen after supper and listen to all our favorite radio shows ? You remember that , Jimmy ? I remember . Did n't we have some laughs back then ? We had more fun than a barrel of monkeys . And I 'd make up stories for us about riding a train all the way to Hollywood where I 'd get discovered and we 'd be filthy rich and buy us a big fancy house with a big old swimming pool . And I 'd get a pony with a silver-trimmed saddle . And I was pretty enough too . Everyone used to say so . We sure had some fun , you and me . Yeah , Jimbo said . We had some fun . Oh , well . Oh , well . God 's ways are ways of mystery . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one big test . You know I 'll miss you , you stinker . I know we fuss a lot around here but I 'll miss you . Yeah . I 'll miss you too , Mom . Really . Well , I 'll be down to visit you and Mom whenever I feel up to it . And your dad did n't say anything about you not visiting here . Forget it . Well , your dad 's just upset right now . He 'll cool down . I do n't give a damn what he does , dig ? I pray every night for things to get happier around here . And I have faith they will . Just as soon as I 'm cured . You 'll see . I think I 'll say a little prayer for us right now , Jimbo 's mother said and shut her eyes and began moving her lips silently . Jimbo watched her . He squinted his eyes and stared at her . Although she was only feet from him she seemed strangely far away , as though he was observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnified from far away : as though she was not happening here and now with the room at all . The more intently Jimbo stared the more rarefied with clarity and sharpness her features became , yet always with that sense of magnified distance . Then her image seemed to slowly recede . Past the window she went , out into the evening yard into the breaking up is hard to do  | darkening trees , then beyond . Jimbo squinted . his eyes at her slow going away . The praying woman fading out through the window into the evening shadows . Who is she ? Jimbo wondered . Who is she ? Who is she ? God 's ways are ways of mystery , Jimbo 's mother said aloud and turned from the window to look at him . Jimbo shook his head slightly and blinked his eyes , trying to focus on her here and now evening-shadowed face . Streetlight coming through the window behind her trimmed her hair like a thin encircling flame . Yeah , sure , Jimbo said . Like , amen . Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amen . Honestly , Jimmy , what 's going to come of you ? I swan to gracious I do n't know . Suddenly she laughed , giving her head a slight toss , and in the desk lamp 's light her white teeth flashed and the electric glow about her hair shimmered in the dark . In the soft light laughing she looked almost young and beautiful again . Smiling , she walked over to the bed and fussed briefly with the packed clothes in the suitcase . Well , if you do come visit I promise I wo n't be so gloomy all the time , she said , still smiling . Amen , Jimbo said . Amen is right . Yes , indeedy , I will be downright lighthearted . We 'll have us some laughs like the old days . Anyway , I have what you might call a little bon voyage surprise for you . Gee , you should n't have , Jimbo said . Oh , it 's not much . Just a trifle . Just an old book actually . An old book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , do n't you be cute , young man . No , it 's not a Bible although that 's not a bad idea at all . Anyhow , it 's packed in here under your socks . I hope it has pictures . Oh , you , Jimbo 's mother said and walked over beside him . Well , I guess I better get some supper for your dad . You sure jobs , 1959  | you wo n't come on down and eat a bite with us on your last night ? It 'd be all right I just know . I bet your dad would even like it . Forget it . I 'm going out with the guys anyway . Oh , please do n't get in any trouble . Please behave . Sure . I promise I wo n't do anything you would n't do . You stinker you , she said and roughed Jimbo 's hair and winked . You sure are a handsome devil , I 'll say that . I just hope you 'll turn out a good boy . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be happy with that I guess . And be lighthearted . You can be lighthearted and good too . You do n't have to turn out gloomy like me just because you 're good . Well , I* promise I wo n't turn out gloomy anyway . What about being good ? Do n't I get any credit around here ? Did n't I tell you that my dirty-poem-writing days are over ? I 've turned in my dirty quill for good . How 's them apples ? Oh , I do n't know if that 's so good or not after all . I do n't know . I used to know someone who sure liked poems . I think I was just being gloomy about those poems . I do n't know . Sometimes I think I 've just been going around here like a wicked old stepmother or something . What if I told you I was taking up praying instead of poeming for a hobby ? You stinker you . I 'd say you 'd best watch your nose does n't start growing right off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibbing . That 's what I 'd say . Well , I just have to get busy on supper . Please behave tonight , you hear now ? As soon as his mother had left the room Jimbo rummaged through the suitcase on the bed . Well I 'll be damn , he thought when he found the book . Your old basic Sonnets from the Portuguese . Your old basic How do I love thee syndrome . Jimbo turned the thin leather-bound book around in his hands , looking it over carefully . I 'll be damn , he said aloud and laughed quietly . Let me count the basic ways blah blah . I love thee to the depth and breadth and blah blah my soul can reach blah blah blah . So someone once laid old love sonnet city breaking up is hard to do  | on old Mom . Love sonnet city . Damn . Jimbo looked for an inscription . The title page had been carefully cut out . Jimbo smiled and put the book back in the suitcase under his socks . Well , boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimbo thought and checked his watch . He shadowboxed for a few minutes in front of the full-length mirror on the back of his bedroom door . Blam blam pow socko . Blam blam Hutch Bodine . Blam your ass is grass tonight , baby ! Jimbo laughed and flopped on his bed . He was going to kiss this two-bit burg good-bye in style , by God . Shit yes , man . Hell , he was n't being run out of this two-bit burg like a goddamn dog with his tail tucked . Hell , he was making the perfect getaway . Scot-free , by God ! Ile was going to kiss this two-bit burg good-fucking-bye in style , man . But first , Jimbo thought and checked his watch again , how about taking a little time out for a final whack-off . Yes , siree . Now that just might hit the old spot . A little old whack-off for old time 's sake . It would probably be the last whack-off this old bed would ever see . This bedroom . It was on August 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Rebel Without No Cause last took dork in hand and for a final time puffed his imaginary honey 's pussypie with pearls . Yes , siree , Jimbo said and unzipped his jeans . He rolled over onto his stomach and felt around under the bed for the sock . He did n't know what to think when he found the sock . He rolled over onto his back and held the soft , limp , laundered sock up before his eyes . Jimbo just did n't know what to think .  | The movie continues . The students of Dawson High School , on a field trip , sit in the L.A. Planetarium 's darkened auditorium , a projection of the universe glowing on the dome above them like a giant expanding movie , on whose curved screen the lecturer may at will expose stars , inflate galaxies , collapse constellations , or just spin them near for a closeup . For many days before the end of our earth , the lecturer drones , people will look into the night sky and notice a new star , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dawson High School and arriving late for the field trip to the planetarium , James Dean , perfectly on cue , enters the darkened auditorium . When in a stage whisper he announces his name to the teacher checking names at the door the lecturer hesitates and all of the students turn in unison to stare at James Dean . Letting his lower face collapse into smiles , James Dean slouches to a seat . As this star approaches us the weather will change , the lecturer drones on . The great polar fields of the north and south will rot and divide , and the seas will turn warmer . Whew , James Dean sighs , leaning back in his seat and looking up at the projected stars . Once you 've been up there , you really know you 've been someplace , he says quietly to no one in particular .  | As the lecture on the nature of the universe continues , the lecturer points out constellations and describes them and tells the students their myths . And this is the crab constellation , Cancer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buzz , the leader of the pack , says and walks his fingers across Natalie Wood 's breasts and pinches Goon 's nose . The other pack members giggle . James Dean , sitting several rows behind them , lets his lower face collapse into smiles . And this is Taurus , the bull , the lecturer drones . Moo , James Dean moos . M00000000 . The members of the pack turn around and stare at James Dean . Nobody laughs . Yeah , moo , Crunch says . Moo . That 's real cute . Moo , Buzz says . Hey , he 's real tough , Goon says . y I bet he fights with cows , Crunch says . ! I Moo , Buzz says . James Dean slumps back in his seat . You should n't monkey with Buzz , Sal Mineo whispers from where he is sitting in his movierole Plato behind James Dean . What ? Buzz is a wheel . So 's Judy . It 's hard to make friends without them . I do n't want to make friends , James Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. sunlight , Crunch asks Buzz what they can do now for kicks . What about Moo ? Goon suggests . OK , Buzz says . OK . Moo . James Dean , sitting on a parapet outside the planetarium , watches the pack circle his raked black Mercury parked in the driveway below . Dancelike , Buzz swings Natalie Wood around beside the raked Mercury 's right front fender and she hops up i 4 on it and dangles her beautiful nylon-stockinged leg beside the right front whitewall . Taking out his switchblade , Buzz kneels slowly and clicks the knife open . Only inches from Natalie Wood 's beautiful ankle Buzz presses the knife 's tip against the i tire . He hesitates a moment , then plunges the switchblade h  | deep into the whitewall . They all stare up at James Dean . James Dean lets out a slow painful breath of air and slides from the parapet and slouches slowly down the winding driveway to where the pack waits patiently around the wounded raked Mercury . You know something ? James Dean says wearily as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You read too many comic books , James Dean says and opens his Mercury 's trunklid and takes out a tireiron . Hey , Buzz says to the pack . Moo is real abstract . I 'm cute , too , James Dean says , taking off his sportcoat and tossing it onto the trunklid . He slouches slowly around the Mercury to the stabbed whitewall . Suddenly Goon begins clucking softly like a chicken . One by one the other pack members pick it up . Buzz , the last , crows loudly . Does that mean me ? James Dean yells and draws back the tireiron . What ? Buzz asks , grinning and rolling his tongue in his cheek . Chicken ! When on cue James Dean has finally been egged into picking up the switchblade someone tossed to his feet to knife-fight Buzz says : Remember , no cutting , just sticking . Jab real cool . I thought only punks fought with knives , James Dean says . Who 's fighting ? Buzz says . This is the test , man . It 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , their switchblades flashing in the dazzling L.A. sunlight . Buzz snarls , grins , rolls his tongue in his cheek . James Dean is hesitant , awkward . The L.A. sunlight is fierce . Things seem to steam in the heat . The heat presses James Dean 's shoulders and back . It begins to scorch his cheeks and beads of sweat gather in his eyebrows . He thinks suddenly of the horrible heat at his mother 's funeral that day long ago in the Midwest . Veins seem to be bursting  | through the skin of his forehead . It strikes James Dean that all he would have to do is turn and walk away from this scene and think no more about it . Go back to the Midwest maybe p and think no more about movies . Suddenly a shaft of light shoots upward from Buzz 's knife and James Dean feels it as if a long , thin blade has transfixed his forehead . Sweat from his eyebrows splashes down , covering his eves and beneath the veil of brine and tears he is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat haze . James Dean is aware only of the keen blade of light flashing up from Buzz 's knife . Everything begins to reel . James Dean lunges at Buzz who steps easily aside . Oh , that was cute , Moo , Buzz says and laughs . The other pack members laugh , laugh . James Dean makes another quick , awkward lunge and Buzz deftly jabs Dean 's stomach with his switchblade . A spot of blood blossoms on James Dean 's shirt . I ' Cut ! Cut ! Nick Ray , the director , yells when he spots the blood . He calls frantically for a first-aid man . What the hell are you doing ? James Dean screams at Nick Ray . Ca n't you see I 'm having a goddamn real moment ? Do n't you ever cut a scene while I 'm having a goddamn real moment !

They are parked up on Snake Road in what was once Jimbo and Judy 's special spot overlooking the city 's lights , radio blaring , the midnight blue ' 49 Ford 's doors wide open , the headlights on . This is the third time they have checked the special spot this evening . They have driven slowly past Judy 's house five times and past Hutch Bodine 's house four . They have cruised the town 's main downtown drag and through the Beacon DriveIn 's parking lot a dozen times each . No sign yet of Judy and i Hutch Bodine . Jimbo and Pace are sitting up on the Ford 's warm hood with their backs pressed against the cool windshield passing a pint of sloe gin between them . Boots , at sixteen a year younger and sort of Jimbo 's sidekick , is bopping about in the carlights in time to the blaring rock and roll while  | he slashes and stabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to fall , man , Jimbo says and takes a pull from the pint , then passes it to Pace .

Well , man , like , I ai n't poor-mouthing your fistic abilities , dig ? I mean , like , I 've seen your action , right ? You 're no pussy , man . But Hutch Bodine , man . Hutch Bodine . Listen , man , Jimbo says , I got one fist of iron and the other of steel and if the right one do n't get him then the left one will . But Hutch Bodine , man .

Some asshole trainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to get a new trainer . A trainer who has faith in me . Damn it ! I 'm telling you Captain College is going to fall , , Jimbo says and smacks his sock-covered right fist into his left palm . What the fuck are you wearing that sock on your hand for anyway , man ? You 're getting crazy as batshit . This is your basic clean and well-laundered sock , man , Jimbo says and holds his sock-covered fist up like a hand puppet , his fingers and thumb its mouth . Its name is Plato , Say hello to Uncle Pace , Plato . Hello , Uncle Pace , you cocksucker , Plato the puppet quacks . Plato sounds like fucking Donald Duck , man , Pace says and takes a hit of gin . Yeah , well , old Plato may sound like Donald Duck but he knows some shit . He knows that Captain College is going to fall tonight . Plato has faith in me . Faith . That figures , Pace says . Fucking Donald Duck . Plato is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I 'm Jimbo 's new trainer , Plato quacks .

The stars , man . The stars are with me . Quackshit , Pace says and takes a hit of gin . Let 's talk about something important . Let 's talk about pussy . Pussyquack , Jimbo says and scratches his suddenly itching balls with Plato 's mouth . Ah , pussy , Pace says .

All alone and unfulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes tightly . Pass that fucking pint , man . My baby loves the western movies . The radio blares from the planed and decked and lowered midnight blue ' 49 Ford : My baby loves the western movies . Boots still bops about in the carlights slashing imaginary monsters with his brand-new switchblade . Do n't slice your quack ass off , Jimbo calls to him . Hey , man , I 'm a cool cat , Boots calls back and snapping his fingers bops over to the car . Cool cats do n't get cut , man . Hey , you really gon na lay this blade on me ? For keeps ? It 's all yours , Jimbo says . For quack keeps . It 's your very own singing switchblade , man . And you take good care of it , man . It 's special .

But I was the only one who could pull the sucker out . Dig it , Boots says . Quackshit , Pace says . Let 's roll , Jimbo says and takes Plato off his hand and stuffs the perfect punch  | it in his red windbreaker 's pocket along with Captain 's bozo toy soldier . Jimbo slides down off the hood and bounces around in the carlights flicking punches . Well , man , I do n't see Bodine anywhere , Pace says , as he slowly cruises his midnight blue ' 49 Ford down the town 's main drag . Why do n't you just forget it , man ? Fuck it . Quack it , man . It ai n't worth it . Boring , man , Boots says , as he raps on the dashboard with his forefingers in time to the rock and roll on the blaring radio . Jimbo 's gon na kick some badass tonight , man . Action , man . Action . Stick it in your fucking ear , Boots , Pace says . That 's you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that action as long as your ass ai n't in it . Love to watch that action . What you gettin ' so hot about , man ? Boots says . Cool it , Jimbo says . He takes a swallow of warm beer from a bottle . He is lying in the backseat , his feet sticking out the left window . Try the Beacon again , Pace . It 's your ass , Pace says and peels out . Jimbo takes another swallow of warm beer and through his squinted eyes watches the lush neon lights along the drag as they gather like schools of small , bright tropical fish in the curved rear window , then flow and fade dreamlike . It had been in this very backseat . Jimbo and Judy had gone all the way for the very first time in this very backseat . Jimbo polishes off the warm beer with a final big pull and tosses the empty bottle onto the floor . One more dead soldier , Jimbo says . Pop me another brew , Boots . Well , man , Pace says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ag into the Beacon 's parking lot , you finally bought it . Bodine 's here , man . Hot shit ! Boots yells . Action , man . Stark is gon na bring that asshole down , man . Is Judy with him ? Jimbo asks .  | No , man , Pace says . Bodine 's sitting on his hood shooting the shit with some of his flunky cronies . They 're all parked at the end of the lot . So what 's the script , man ? Just pull in somewhere . I want to kill this goddamn beer . Hey , man , Pace says , as he slides his bomb into a vacant slot , I actually think you can take Bodine . I was just jiving you about him kicking your ass , man . But , fuck , man , it 's going to be a bad news brawl . And you 've been boozing all night . You 've been boozing like it 's going out of style , man . You 're half shitfaced . Half , my ass , Jimbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked . Dig it , man , Pace says . Listen , why do n't you fight the cocksucker sometime when you 're straight ? Then you can really kick his ass proper , man . I 'm pretty shitfaced all right , Jimbo says . Right , Pace says . And from here Bodine looks sober as a goddamn judge . I 'd love to see you kick his ass , man . Take the punk on when you 're straight , man . Boring , Boots says . Fuck , man , Stark can take Bodine anytime . Drunk as a skunk , man . Do n't matter , man . Stark is a mean man . Shut your fucking mouth , man , Pace says . Hey , you assholes , cool it , Jimbo says . You guys are supposed to be my seconds , dig ?

Get your ass quacked , man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old pal , Jimbo says and sitting up in the seat pats Pace 's shoulder . The stars , man . The stars are right , re-member ? Quack the stars , toughboy . I do n't have a choice . The fuck you do n't , man . You got a choice . No , I do n't , man . Action , Boots laughs . Gon na have some action tonight . Action , Jimbo says quietly and opens the cardoor. the perfect punch  | You sure you do n't want your blade back ? Boots says . Knife-fighting is for punks , man , Jimbo says . He zips his red windbreaker up to his throat and pulls its collar up in back . Besides , man , I got one fist of iron and the other of steel and if the right one do n't get him then the left one will . I can dig it , man . Boots laughs . Quackshit , Pace says . I do n't reckon one of you seconds would like to double for me , Jimbo says , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ass , Pace says . I 'll dub in your quack screams for you though . Hey , pal , thanks , Jimbo says and pats Pace 's shoulder . Action , Boots says . Let 's rumble . Right , man , Jimbo says and fires up a Camel . Action . Lights . Scene one . Take one . Camera . Roll ' em . Jimbo polishes off his beer , drops the dead soldier onto the backseat floor with the others , and climbs slowly out of the car . Whew , he thinks , leaning back against the door . Fuck , I am shitfaced . Whew . Jimbo squints his eyes in the strange bluegreen light , light in which he feels submerged , light he can almost imagine as water . Jimbo shakes his head to clear it . You OK , man ? Pace asks as he climbs out of the car . Fine as wine , Jimbo says , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . He takes the Camel from his lips with his left hand and flicks its ash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket and squeezes Captain 's bozo toy soldier . He squeezes it until he feels pain . Jesus , he thinks . Steady , boy . Jimbo puts the Camel back in his lips and shakes his head again . He rubs his eyes and gazes slowly around the packed parking lot . Everything looks so goddamn strange , all the cars , the people , as though they are all slightly out of proportion somehow , slightly larger or smaller than they should be , as though he is , actually , seeing them through water . And in the strange , submerged bluegreen light the colors seem so intensely technicolor they burn his eyes . Jimbo tightens his grip on the toy soldier in his pocket and tries to push erect from the cardoor : but suddenly dizzy , almost sick to his stomach , he  | slumps back . Got to stay in contact , boy , Jimbo thinks to himself , shutting his eyes . Ca n't lose it . Got to stay in touch . Hey , man , just fuck it , Pace says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man . Much less Hutch Bodine . You can hardly stand up , man . Let 's take a drive and get some air . Then come back later . Dig , man ? I did n't know I was getting so fucked up , man , Jimbo says , rubbing his closed , aching eyes . Come on , man , Pace says . Let 's cruise for a while . Maybe you 're right , Jimbo says . Let me think a minute , man . Jimbo takes a deep breath and leans his head back on the cartop . He watches the beams from the two huge searchlights on the Beacon 's roof as they sweep across the gathering summery rainclouds like swift , ghostly moons . Opening night , Jimbo thinks as he watches the searchlights . Your basic Hollywood premiere . The premiere of Captain Rebel Without a Cause getting his ass kicked at the Beacon Drive-In . Pace was right . Captain Rebel Without a Cause was going to be the star at his own asskicking . Well , at least he was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fucking way I can beat Hutch Bodine , Jimbo thinks , closing his aching eyes and rubbing them . Hey , daddy , Boots says , lightly rapping Jimbo 's shoulder . Get a load of who just made the scene . Jimbo opens his eyes and blinks them , trying to focus.Judy . Driving.a load of giggling girlfriends in one of her old man 's fancy black Lincolns . Jimbo and Judy 's eyes meet and Judv glances away . Laughing and waving often to friends in other cars , Judy idles the Lincoln along in the bumper-to-bumper cruising drive-in traffic . Finally , she pulls into a vacant slot only three cars away from Hutch Bodine 's Mean Green Machine , a 1958 green Impala with long chrome lakes and glass-pac mufflers , a bomb almost as famous far and wide as the Silver Ghost . See , man ? Pace says . Judy 's not even out with Bodine tonight , man . Like I told you , Penny just saw them out at the the perfect punch  | country club together today . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hanging out together all afternoon , Jimbo says . You said so , man . You said Penny saw Bodine carrying Judy around in the pool . Forget it , man , Pace says . It 's no big thing . I should of kept my fucking trap shut . The scene is set , Jimbo says , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . Action , man . Camera . Roll ' em . R-O-L-L , roll ' em , man . Jimbo flicks his cigarette away . He pushes erect from the cardoor and stuffs both hands into his windbreaker 's pockets . He shuts his eyes and squeezes the toy soldier tightly in his right hand until the dizziness passes . Got to stay in touch , he thinks and takes several unsteady steps . Fuck this , man . Just fuck this . Jimbo stops and takes a deep breath . Captain Rebel Without a Cause ai n't gon na stagger-ass like a goddamn drunk nigger across this fucking parking lot , man . No way , man . No fucking way . Imagining with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some giant aquarium 's deep end , Jimbo , flanked by Pace and Boots , slouches slowly but steadily across the parking lot toward the Mean Green Machine . When Jimbo reaches the edge of Bodine 's circle of flunkies Bodine looks up at him and grins broadly . Trying to stand without weaving , Jimbo puts a Camel to his mouth , and after successfully striking a match with one hand , a trick it took him two weeks to master , he lights the cigarette 's center . Jesus Christ , Jimbo screams inside himself and tosses the burned Camel to the pavement in disgust . In spite of himself , Jimbo glances toward Judy 's car only to discover that she is , indeed , laughing . Like , I mean , Bodine will fuck anything that crawls , man , Bob Tweel , one of Bodine 's flunkies , says , and all Bodine 's other flunkies laugh . Tweel is bopping about in the center of the circle of flunkies telling Hutch Bodine stories while Bodine sits on the hood of the Mean Green Machine grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoots , man , Tweel squeals . And , man , I mean the chick we picked up that night was really a dog . Really ugly . I mean ugly . So I say to Bodine , man , I would n't fuck this dog with your dick , and so Bodine says to me , man , you turn cunts upside down and they : all look just the same , then Bodine says to the dog , honey , for my good deed of the month I 'm gon na mercy-fuck your brains out your ears . Well , boy , like I always say , pussy is pussy , Hutch says and laughs and all his flunkies laugh and nudge each other . Ai n't that right , Jimbo baby ? Pussy is pussy . Nudging each other and grinning like crazy , all Bodine 's flunkies turn to look at Jimbo . Jimbo arches his eyebrows and wrinkles his forehead and tries frantically to clear his mind , to . focus on this scene , to smack that shit-eating superior smirk off Hutch Bodine 's handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-cross roundhouse reply . But he ca n't . He just ca n't think , ca n't focus . Sweat pops out on his forehead and runs in thin , cold streams from under his arms . He just ca n't think . Dumbfuck . Dumbfuck . And there is smartass Hutch Bodine , big college jock , neat Princeton haircut , country club cool and summery in bright plaid bermudas and a blue boat-neck shirt , sitting so superior on the hood of his Mean Green Machine grinning at Jimbo the jerk . On this sweet , sweet summer night , Jimbo the jerk , in his scuffi d motorcycle boots , his jakey jeans , his ratty red windbreaker : Jimbo the jerk , with his long hair swept back hopelessly unsummery on the sides , swept back almost like a low-down punkboy Presley DA , hopelessly uncountry-clubby , unsummery , unbright and neat , hopelessly low-down and greasy . Greasy . Greasy is the word all right , Jimbo thinks , imagining bluegreen beads of punkboy grease sliding slowly from his hairline , sliding over his sweaty forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face and neck . Jimbo arches his eyebrows and wrinkles his forehead and lets his lower face collapse into a sappy grin .  | Yeah , Hutch says , my experience has been that pussy is pussy . You agree , Jimbo boy ? You read too many comic books , Jimbo says , his grin feeling sappier by the second . Hutch laughs . He drops his arm around a flunky sitting on the carhood beside him and whispers something to him . Hutch holds the middle finger of his left hand up and runs it slowly under his nose , sniffing it . Hutch laughs , then runs the finger slowly under the flunky 's nose who sniffs it loudly and rolls his eyes . Come over here , Tweel , Hutch says . Let me get another opinion on this . Tweel bops over to the car and Hutch slowly runs the finger under his nose . Oh , la la ! Tweel squeals and bops about snapping his fingers . Yum yum yum for the tum ! Yeah , I guess I 'll have to amend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his finger . Some pussy is sure sweeter than other pussy . Some pussy is downright finger-licking good . Yum yum . Hutch licks his finger , then runs it slowly in and out of his mouth . Right , Jimbo boy ? Hutch says . Finger-licking good . Fuck you , Bodine , Jimbo says . Hutch laughs and slides down off the carhood . Jimbo stares at Hutch 's muscular , college-fullback arms . Jimbo 's own arms feel like noodles . He tries to imagine throwing a punch at Hutch 's face . Hutch blocks the punch easily and Jimbo pictures his noodle arm wrapping helplessly around Hutch 's thick wrist . Jimbo 's legs suddenly also feel like noodles . He grips the toy soldier in his pocket until pain shoots up his noodle arm , shoots up his neck , and spreads like a blush on his right cheek . Please , God , Jimbo thinks . Please . Please , at least do n't let me puke . Or , Jesus , Jesus , piss myself . You want a whiff , Jimbo boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and licking the finger . Hell , boy , you can  | even have a lick if you want it . For old time 's sake , kid . Hell , I ai n't greedy . Yum yum . Fuck you , Bodine , Jimbo says . My , my , Hutch says and stops a couple of steps in front of Jimbo . Now what kind of language is that , son ? You never did learn your lessons good , did you , boy ? You just have n't got any manners at all . When a party offers to share a sniff of the sweet stuff , son , you ought to accept . Now that 's good manners , see ? Otherwise a party might take offense . Then , boy , you might find that your ass is grass and some party is the mower , see ? F-U-C-K , fuck you , boy , Jimbo says . Well , Jimbo boy , Hutch says , laughing , you got a choice . I like to be fair . So if you take a great big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe even give my finger a little lick or two , or maybe just suck on the tip a bit , just the tip mind you , I might not kick the shit out of you . See ? Why not let me have a little whiff ? someone says from the edge of the gathering crowd . Everyone turns to look . The crowd parts as Frankie walks through it toward Hutch . Although he is short , Frankie slouches slump shouldered , and except for his arms , more muscular even than Hutch 's , he looks almost frail . A cigarette dangles from his mouth and his heavy-lidded eyes look almost shut . He walks slowly through the parting crowd right up to Hutch and tilts his head back to gaze up into Hutch 's face through squinted eyes . Me too , Bodine ? Frankie says , almost in a whisper . He smiles and runs both hands back through blond hair almost as long as Jimbo 's . Yum yum , Bodine ? Hey there , Frankie , Hutch says , smiling weakly . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shaking , Bodine ? What 's shaking ? Hey , gosh , I want a little sniff , Bodine , Frankie says , still smiling . I want a little sniff . Or maybe a lick , Bodine . Yum yum , Bodine . Hey , man , Hutch says , laughing faintly . We 're just fooling around , man . Oh , Frankie says . Oh . Fooling around . Oh .  | Yeah , man , Hutch says and shrugs his shoulders . Just jiving old Jimbo here , man . Oh . Just jiving old Jimbo here , Frankie says . Hey there , old Jimbo . Hey , Frankie , Jimbo says . How you doing , old Jimbo ? Frankie says . Hanging in there , Frankie . Hanging , man . Well , what 's new , old Jimbo ? Frankie says , still smiling and squinting his eyes at Hutch 's face . Not much , man , Jimbo says . I 've been drunk a lot . Oh . Drunk a lot , Frankie says . Well , you seen any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimbo says . I been drunk a lot lately . Oh . Well , check out Thunder Road , man , Frankie says and takes the cigarette from his lips . He holds it up between his thumb and forefinger and blows lightly on its ember . It 's playing out at the StarLite Drive-In . Great flick , old Jimbo Starring badass Robert Mitchum . And starring his kid too . Co-starring Mitchum 's real-life kid . Only , Mitchum 's real-life kid plays his kid brother in the flick . Hey , you seen that flick , Bodine ? Yeah , Frankie , Hutch says . Sure , I saw it , man . You 're right , man . Great fucking flick . Yeah , man , Tweel squeals , snapping his fingers . Great fucking flickeroo . Please do n't do that , Frankie says quietly and squints his eyes at Tweel . Please do n't talk so loud . You do n't have to shout around all the time . Or snap your fingers all the time . It gives me a headache , friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sure . Hey , Hutch , Frankie says and squints his eyes up at Hutch 's face . He smiles . You remember that wonderful , wild scene where this moonshining gangster cat is trying to run Mitchum off the road ? Remember that scene , Bodine ? Right , Hutch says . Great fucking scene , man . Yes , it was . Yes , it was a great fucking scene , Frankie says . He blows on his cigarette 's ember . And remember how old  | badass Mitchum and the moonshining gangster cat pull up even while they 're roaring over them twisty backcountry roads smashing shit out of each other 's bombs and then old Mitchum suddenly flicks his fag through the cat 's open carwindow and it fucking hits the cat in the cheek ? Crazy , man . Fucking sparks everywhere , man . Crazy . And the cat loses control of his bomb and runs the fuck off the road and boom it blows the fuck up and the cat fries . Crazy , man . Great fucking scene . Great scene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gee , Bodine , Frankie says and winks at Hutch , why wo n't you let me sniff your finger ? I never smelled my sister 's pussy before , Bodine . Pretty please , Bodine . Hey , Frankie , Hutch says , I was just shooting the shit , man . Honest , man . Just jiving Jimbo around , man . Oh , Frankie says , smiling . Oh . Frankie flicks his glowing cigarette at Hutch 's face . Hutch flinches and the cigarette splatters against his throat in a shower of sparks and falls down the front of his boat-neck shirt . Jesus Christ , Frankie ! Hutch yells , slapping the front of his shirt like crazy and hopping around . Jesus fucking Christ , man ! Shit , man ! His hand heavy with the metal toy soldier , Jimbo swings a roundhouse right at the center of Hutch 's face . Hutch 's eyes pop cartoon wide with shock as Jimbo 's weighted fist slams into his upper lip and nose . Jimbo 's knuckles crunch against collapsing teeth and bone and blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Mean Green Machine . He staggers forward two steps , then falls to his knees , holding his dripping face in his hands . He slowly rolls over onto his side and draws his knees up to his chest , moaning . Staggered several steps backward by the force of the blow himself , Jimbo , dizzy , tingling , stares at the fallen Hutch in stunned disbelief . No one in the pressing crowd moves or speaks . Jimbo holds his right hand up before his eyes and looks  | it slowly over as though it is a thing not his own .. His middle three knuckles are bloody and misshapen and pushed back on his hand but he feels no pain at all . He opens his hand and examines with interest how several parts of the toy metal soldier are actually embedded in his bloody palm . Beautiful , Frankie says quietly , breaking the spell . Beautiful punch . The perfect punch . Jesus Christ ! someone in the crowd says . Goddamn ! someone else says . Motherfuck ! several say . Suddenly Boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down over him , and waving a finger in the air begins to count : one two three four five six seven eight nine ten you 're out , you cocksucker ! Boots runs over to Jimbo and raises his battered right hand in the air . Winner by a fucking KO in one second of the first round ! Boots shouts . The new champ , Jimbo Stark ! Fuck that ! Tweel squeals . Stark suckerpunched him . He suckerpunched Hutch and he 's got something in his goddamn hand too ! That 's not fair , goddamn it ! No , Frankie says quietly , squinting his eyes at Tweel . But it 's over . Fuck that ! Tweel squeals . Stark suckerpunched Hutch ! Yeah , Stark suckerpunched Hutch ! another flunky yells . Yeah ! Tweel squeals . That 's not fair ! That 's chickenshit as hell . Yeah , chickenshit ! another flunky yells . Chickenshit ! others yell . Chickenshit ! Chickenshit ! You goddamn chickenshit ! Tweel yells and runs toward Jimbo . In a quick move , Frankie steps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hook to the gut . Tweel squeals and doubles over and starts staggering about grunting for breath . Anyone else want a piece of my heart ? Frankie says , smiling . Hey , man ! Jimbo says , pushing Frankie aside . This is my movie , man ! I 'm no chickenshit , goddamn it ! I 'll fight any one of these punk cocksuckers , goddamn it ! Come on , you punk  | cocksuckers ! Let 's rumble ! Jimbo yells and stalks toward the flunkies crowded around the fallen Hutch . Pace grabs Jimbo 's arms from behind . Come on , man , Pace says . It 's over , man ' You won . Let 's get the fuck out of here , man . I 'm gon na kick ass all night ! Jimbo yells , trying to shake loose . Your buddy is right , Frankie says and steps in front of Jimbo . It 's done , kid . You ought to cut out . The fuzz are going to appear . Cut out , old Jimbo . Shit ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Jimbo Stark has n't even started to kick ass ! Be quiet , Frankie says to Boots . Yes , sir , Boots says . Jimbo sees Judy emerge from the crowd . Her eyes are wide and bright and she is clutching her throat . She looks at Jimbo and starts quickly toward him . Then she spots the fallen Hutch and stops dead in her tracks . She looks back and forth between the fallen Hutch and Jimbo , her mouth open wide with astonishment . Jimbo arches his eyebrows and smiles . Suddenly Judy swirls and runs to the fallen Hutch . She falls to her bare knees beside him and making sympathetic cooing sounds takes his head onto her lap . She runs her fingers through Hutch 's hair . She is wearing short shorts and her brown bare legs become smeared with Hutch 's blood . You hoodlum ! Judy cries at Jimbo , glaring at him , her eyes filling with tears . You gangster ! What ? Jimbo shouts , trying to break free from Pace 's grip . No ! That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here , Frankie says to Pace , and together they muscle Jimbo backward across the parking lot . I did it for you , Judy ! Jimbo shouts . I love you , Judy ! I love you ! Just as Frankie and Pace shove Jimbo into the backseat of Pace 's Ford the fuzz arrive , the black and white patrol car swinging into the parking lot with red bubble flashing . Can you handle him ? Frankie asks Pace .  | No sweat , Pace says and hops into the frontseat . Wait for me , man , Boots calls , running up to the car . Vanish , punk , Frankie tells Boots . Yes , sir , Boots says and walks quickly away . Firing up a cigarette , Frankie strolls slowly across the lot to where the Silver Ghost is parked . You stay the fuck down in the fucking seat , champ , Pace says toJimbo and starts up the engine quietly , with no revving , no muffler popping . Pace drives off the parking lot slowly . So where to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . She did me dirt . Come on , champ , where to ? Pace says . Home , man ? Home ? Home ? Are you shitting me , man ? Jimbo says . I do n't have a home . I do n't have shit , man . Jesus Christ ! Pace says and shifts into low , peeling out . Do n't start blubbering on me , man . Come on , Jimbo , where to ? Boomer 's , Jimbo says . Where 's Boomer at , man ? Out at his summer camp ? Yeah , Jimbo says . Hey , Pace , do me one last favor . Name it , champ . The big envelope I brought with me tonight . Give it to Judy for me , man . Tell her she can do anything she wants with it . Tell her I dropped her ring in it and that she can do anything she wants with it too . And tell her I loved her . Sure , champ . Sure .  | The old cemetery at the edge of town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man Ketchum , Boomer 's father and the richest mortician in town , had closed it and incorporated the rolling slopes of several farms south of town into burial lots whose reasonable rates marked them from the beginning as good investments . The old cemetery was mostly overgrown now , with many toppled tombstones and sunken graves . The old , one-story stone caretaker 's house , its front rooms gutted by fire years earlier , stood at the top of steep , narrow stone steps that wound up around the hill at the town-side edge of the old cemetery . Each year at the first sign of warm weather Boomer would move from his small apartment above the mortuary to the back unburned rooms of this old caretaker 's house for the summer . The old stone house was cool inside and private and the overgrown graveyard had almost returned to forest . It made a dandy summer camp , Boomer always explained . And every red-blooded American boy ought to get to go off to summer camp . Jimbo watches Pace peel out in the spraying roadside gravel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward town . He turns and begins stumbling up the steep stairs . Panting , he sits down on the top step and awkwardly with his left hand fires up a cigarette . His right hand is swollen now  | and aching . With his left hand 's fingertips he lightly brushes the smashed knuckles and winces at the shooting pain . Oh Jesus , he says aloud and blows on the knuckles . He takes the sock out of his windbreaker 's pocket and carefully slips it over the battered hand . The old soldier tends his bloody war wounds , Jimbo thinks and smiles . The perfect punch . Jimbo cradles the hand close to his chest and gazes out over the lights of the town and the headlights and taillights of the cars coming and going across the new bridge to Ohio . The old bridge , a half-mile south and closed for years , is dark except for small , red , blinking lights scattered about its piers to warn riverboats . He could buy that old bridge for a lousy buck . That was the rumor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lousy buck . Then of course you had to tear it down yourself and apparently the salvage was not supposed to be enough to make it pay . But for a lousy buck . A whole goddamn bridge for your own . He ought to buy the sucker and refuse to tear it down . Buy it and live on it . Live right in the middle of it . Like the mean old troll , Jimbo thinks , looking at the blood spots spreading on the sock . No one fucks with mean old trolls . Wind rises up in the trees behind him and Jimbo looks back over his shoulder . Summer rainclouds have covered the earlier clear sky and the old caretaker 's house is just a large shadow higher on the hill . Here and there on the hillside among the trees Jimbo can see the dark shapes of tombstones . He shivers . He used to run through these tombstones at night when he was a squirt : run with his pals playing insane spook , hooting and screeching and sometimes toppling over tombstones . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off several small stones to leave on people 's porches : small stones with little lambs perched on their tops or carved on their surfaces . For a long time after that Halloween nightJimbo had had horrible dreams of rotting babies rising from their graves for revenge , their little bald heads pushing up out of the earth like mushroom caps after a rain : dreams of rotting babies dragging him screaming and kicking back to be buried with them in the old cemetery . Jimbo shivers again and stands up .  | The old cemetery , he thinks , looking around the dark , silent hillside . The last , the ultimate boondocks . The boondocks of death . For a moment Jimbo thinks of running down the stone stairs like a bat out of hell . Jesus , he thinks . I need another goddamn drink , Jimbo says aloud and laughs . The shades are drawn in the windows of the back room Boomer uses but Jimbo can see a dim glow of light behind them and he hears low music coming from inside . Jimbo walks across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Immediately someone inside begins to moan horribly and to boo like a ghost . For years the town squirts have been deliciously titillating their terror by skulking around the old haunted caretaker 's house at night . Jimbo smiles . He can remember running crazily down the hill as a squirt himself , pop-eyed with delightful fear . Oh 00000000000000h 0000000000000h , the haunter moans . B000000 b00000000000 , the haunter boos . M000000000000 m00000000000 , yourself , Jimbo moos . Hey , squirt , come on in , Boomer calls , in his deep , froggy voice . Boomer is sitting at the old kitchen table in the center of the small room . The only light in the room is from a portable teevee sitting on a chair in one corner . The teevee 's sound is turned off and the music , a country tune , is coming from an old Silvertone radio placed on top of the teevee set . Get yourself a brew , squirt , Boomer says . Thanks , Jimbo says and gets a beer out of the refrigerator , then pulls a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . I was wondering if you 'd get around to saying bye-bye to your poor old Uncle Boomer , Boomer says , the cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth jerking little perfect clouds as he talks . He pushes his old , battered gray fedora even farther back on his head with a thumb , then carefully fills the shot glass on the table in front of him to its brim from a quart bottle of bourbon . He refills a half-full water glass with beer ,  | then freely sprinkles its top from a large-sized circular Morton 's Salt container . I 've been saying a lot of bye-byes tonight , Jimbo says , staring at the sinking salt crystals as they dissolve in effervescent bubbles in Boomer 's beer . Jimbo takes a long pull from his own bottle of beer . What time does your bus depart tomorrow , squirt ? Fuck the bus . Now that could n't be a great deal of fun . That 's sure a cute glove you 're wearing there , squirt . That 's my sidekick Plato , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table in front of him . He 's bleeding . So I see . War wounds , Jimbo says . With his left forefinger and thumb he picks at the blood-soaked sock . I kicked shit out of Hutch Bodine tonight . That was a bye-bye I wish you could have seen . Not me , squirt . The sight of blood makes me burp . But congratulations anyway , Boomer says . He drinks half the bourbon from the shot glass , chases it with half the beer from the water glass , then carefully refills them both . What a goddamn mess . I 'm only seventeen and already everything 's broken down , Jimbo says , shaking his head . He holds the nearly empty bottle up before him and rotates it slowly , watching the small image of the teevee move like a tiny moon over the curved dark surface of the glass . Across the room , on floor-to-ceiling shelves , glass jars reflect hundreds of tiny teevee screens : rows upon rows of glass jars full of dead little creatures floating in alcohol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Scientific Specimen Collection , a collection he had worked on steadily for years . Eyes , Jimbo suddenly thinks . The tiny teevee screens reflected in the glass jars are like hundreds of eyes : bright , unblinking , busy little eyes , as though all the little creatures in the jars are suddenly alive and staring at him . Jimbo reaches for Boomer 's quart bottle of bourbon.  | I 'm going to miss you , you old weird duck , Jimbo says . You 're about the only friend I have . You and old Pace . Well , I suppose I 'll miss you too , squirt . You 're about the only witness I have . An old weird duck needs a young weird duck around for a witness . Dig it , Jimbo says and takes a drink . Listen , squirt , Boomer says , as rain suddenly gusts against the windows . Sounds like a nice night out . For spooks and weird ducks anyway . Dig it , Jimbo says . He picks up the Morton 's Salt container and studies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as she walks along in the rain . When it rains it pours , Jimbo reads . He pours a small mound of salt out on the tabletop . Profound , Boomer says . Profound . Fuck , man , Jimbo says . He puts his head on the table . I 'm only seventeen and everything is already fucked up . Now , now , squirt , do n't get my tabletop all teary , Boomer says . He drains the shot glass . He puts the empty quart bourbon bottle in the middle of the table . One more dead soldier , squirt , Boomer says . Maybe our last dead soldier together for a spell . Yeah , I guess so , Jimbo says . He holds the empty bourbon bottle up in the light and shakes it , then puts it back on the table . He takes the toy metal soldier from his windbreaker 's pocket and places it beside the empty bottle . Now , here 's your basic dead soldier , Boomer . What do you think of this basic dead soldier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly in his hands , carefully examining its elaborate , bright blue and red , silvertrimmed uniform , its silver , high-pointed , plumed helmet . When Boomer puts the toy soldier back on the table beside the bottle Jimbo picks it up and begins marching it around the tabletop . Forward , march , Jimbo says . Your left , your right , your left , your right , your left . Marches pretty good for an unknowns soldier , right , Boomer ? Pretty goddamn good . Hup , hup , hup.  | Not bad at all , Boomer says . Marching the fuck over hill and hup hup dale , Jimbo says and marches the toy soldier through the small mound of salt . Marching , marching , marching bravely through the goddamn snowy dead of winter . Marching the fuck all over the goddamn snowy Second World War 's dead of winter . Leftfucking-face . Right-fucking-face . About-fucking-face . Right-fucking-face , Boomer says . He begins marching the empty bourbon bottle about the tabletop too . You 're in the goddamn army now ! Jimbo yells and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're in the goddamn army now , Jimbo sings at the top of his lungs and begins to stomp around the table . You 'll never get rich , you son of a bitch , you 're in the army now ! You 're in the army now ! Boomer croaks , pounding the bottle on the table . You 're in the army now ! Onward Christian soldiers ! Onward Christian soldiers ! Jimbo sings , stomping and waving his bloody , sock-covered hand in the air . Onward as to war ! With the cross of Jesus going on before ! The cross of Jesus ! Boomer croaks and pounds the table . Jimbo flops down onto Boomer 's cot near the door and lies there laughing . Finally , catching his breath , he just lies there listening to the rain and staring up at the strange shadows the teevee light flickers over the ceiling . Coughing , Boomer gets up slowly and walks unsteadily over to an old chest of drawers against the wall opposite the door . From its top drawer he takes an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , still coughing , Boomer carefully refills the shot glass to its brim . That cocksucker is the one , Jimbo says . He 's the one who taught me to march . Drilled my ass off . Left-fucking-face . Right-fucking-face . About-fucking-face . Jimbo swings his legs over the cot 's side and sits there holding his face in his hands . He 's the one I should have given the big good-bye to . The cocksucker . The big good-bye in the sky . Banished his ass to the big boondocks in the sky . He 's the  | one I should have drilled with the perfect punch , Jimbo says , standing up wearily . He picks up his knocked-over chair and sits down at the table . He stretches his bloody , sock-covered hand out on the tabletop . Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat , Jimbo says and flicks the toy soldier 's face with Plato 's stiff upper lip , knocking it over . He picks up the Morton 's container and slowly covers the fallen toy soldier with salt . Dead as a doornail , Jimbo says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your wounds , squirt , Boomer says and sips his bourbon . Amen , Jimbo says . Amen , squirt , Boomer says . How could you love him ? Jimbo asks . How could you ever love him ? It was supposed to be the grandest Fourth of July celebration the town had ever witnessed . The mayor at that time , who happened to be Boomer 's father , spent months planning the whole shebang . Planned a grand parade . Grand patriotic floats . Every highschool band in the county . A crack army reserve drill team . The parade paraded all over town . It did not miss a main street . Boomer 's father was its grand marshal and , carrying an American flag , he marched out in front of the grand parade all over town . The parade ended up on the old bridge late in the afternoon where they were going to shoot off the grandest fireworks show of all time . But first the crack army reserve drill team was to shoot off a grand twenty-onegun salute from the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent shells bouncing all over the bridge in the late afternoon sunlight , Boomer says . I scampered about and picked up a whole pocketful . I pretended they were some kind of strange coins . Exotic coins from China . I can remember wondering how high those bullets would rise before they arched and started back down . I remember wondering if the fish would be able to dodge them when those bullets hit the river .  | Another grand attraction was also planned before the grand fireworks show . My dear old departed dad had in a moment of sublime inspiration hired a certain Chief Soaring Eagle to perform a thrilling stunt to really give the folks something to remember . Old Chief Soaring Eagle was a part-time wrestler and circus daredevil quite famous in that day . He claimed to be a bona fide Aztec Indian war chief , although there were a few dastardly rumors to the contrary . Dastardly rumors that Chief was actually a wop from Dayton , Ohio . At any rate , my dear old departed dad hired the great Chief to dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His splashing entrance into the dangerous current was to signal the first flares of the grand fireworks show . Ah , squirt , Chief Soaring Eagle looked magnificent , his eagle-feather headdress gleaming in that late afternoon sunlight . And when with great solemnity he removed his beaded and brightly feathered ceremonial chieftain 's cape there was no doubt in my squirt mind . That beautiful , brown , sleekly muscled body was no Dayton , Ohio , wop 's body . He was truly an Aztec war chief . An Aztec god . You have to picture this , squirt . Chief Soaring Eagle carefully removes his cape and headdress and with grave dignity prepares to daredevil dive into the dangerous river far below . Barefoot , he balances on the narrow railing , his head tilted back as though in worship , his long , black , gleaming hair falling straight back almost to his waist , sunlight golden on his calm , brave face . The highschool bands ' drums roll . My dear old departed dad , resplendent in his World War One infantry captain 's uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crack army reserve drill team is poised to fire a final volley . Slowly , Chief Soaring Eagle raises his powerful arms above his head . Suddenly , bursting through the crowd , yelping and hooting like a movie redskin devil savage , your dad , the captain of all the squirts , jumps up on the railing beside Chief Soaring Eagle . Your dad is bareback and his body and face are streaked with bright red and yellow paint and he is wearing a bandanna with several old bent chicken feathers stuck in it . Listen , squirt . Old Chief Soaring Eagle looked down  | at that painted , feathered , yelping dad of yours with an expression of such bug-eyed , open-mouth , goofy astonishment as I 've never again seen on another human face . The crowd gasped . The drums stopped rolling . My dear old departed dad squealed . Your dad laughed and jumped . Then suddenly I was jumping too . And damn if I know why . I do n't even remember thinking about it . Just suddenly I was watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember being afraid or anything . Actually , I think I was rather calm about the whole thing . I just remember being rather astonished that here I was jumping into the river behind your dad . And , although I do n't remember really thinking about anything in particular , I do remember how it all seemed so slow , like everything was happening in slow motion , and I remember how clear all my impressions were , how clearly I was seeing things , small things like branches floating along in the current . I remember seeing your dad below me in the water and I remember giggling when I saw the amazed look on his face when he spotted me . There I was giggling and I was probably going to drown . Probably going to take the big drink . Hell , I could hardly swim . I do n't remember hitting the water at all . And I do n't remember your dad pulling my ass out of the drink . But he did . He saved me . He pulled my ass out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wop from Dayton , Ohio , refused to dive after that . Old Cap always protected me . Always . From the time we were squirts . Like a big brother . I was under his wing . And for no reason at all . I was always the puny squirt of squirts and old Cap was always the captain of squirts . I was nothing and he always took up for my worthless ass . And besides that time he pulled me out of the big drink there was another occasion when you might say he saved my worthless ass . You mean he saved your life another time ? You might say that . When was it ? What happened ? I was so drunk I can hardly remember it .  | Come on , Boomer . Tell me . Forget it , squirt . Come on , Boomer . How did he save you ? He did n't shoot me . What ? He did n't what ? He did n't shoot me . He did n't shoot you ? When ? What happened ? Forget it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , squirt ! I said forget it . Sure , Boomer . Sure . Pass the goddamn bottle . Sure , Boomer , Jimbo says and passes the bottle . You want to camp out here tonight , squirt ? I 'll get out the other cot . No . Come on . Why do n't you stay here tonight ? No , Jimbo says . He picks the toy soldier up out of the mound of salt and puts it in his windbreaker 's pocket . No . I got things to do . You 're welcome to stay . But suit yourself . I got places to go , Jimbo says and gets up . He walks slowly over to the door and opens it . Rain sweeps in . I need a big drink . That 's what I  --  eed . Plenty to drink here . That 's not the kind of big drink I need , Jimbo says , arching his eyebrows and wrinkling his forehead . Now , now , squirt , do n't get melodramatic . Do n't sweat it , Boomer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tilts back in his chair . He blows a series of perfect smoke rings into the air . Wish I could give you some pearls of wisdom . Some food for thought . Do n't sweat it , Boomer . Well , do n't do anything I would n't do . Do n't take any wooden nickels . Do n't piss against the wind . Life is no bed of roses . By the yard life is hard , by the inch it 's a cinch . Never  | use sobriety as a crutch . Behind every dark cloud there 's a silver lining . Hitch your wagon to a star . A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . The truth is always leaked . The highest motive is to be like water . Never go to reality stag . The good traveler leaves no tracks . Thanks for the tips , Uncle . You 're welcome , squirt , Boomer says and smiles . The smoky air about his shadowed skullface is luminous in the flickering teevee light . Catch you , Boomer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet Jimbo balances himself carefully on the railing in the center of the old bridge . The rain is cold now and comes in gusts across his face . His eyes blur with water and he can taste rain in the corners of his mouth . He can hear the rushing dark river far below and he thinks about how terribly cold its water must be . His clothes are soaked and he shivers in the cold , rising river air . Farther up the river , lights from the new bridge shudder on the swift , dark current . For a time Jimbo watches the lights of the cars crossing the new bridge . Jimbo closes his eyes and tilts back his head . The big drink , Jimbo thinks and smiles . Jimbo tries to imagine hitting that dark , cold water . How cold would the water be on the bottom ? he wonders . Would he be able to see at all underwater in the dark ? How long would he be able to hold his breath ? He could hold his breath underwater longer than anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the surface , but he liked to swim underwater , to swim close to the bottom for as long as he could hold his breath . The colder the water the firmer the fish , Captain always said . The cocksucker . Jimbo would not even try to swim when he hit that cold water . He would not even try to swim underwater , and he would not hold his breath . He would practice his deadman 's float , that 's what he would do . And it might be days before they found him floating on his face far downriver . And by that time his body would be horribly bloated and fish would have eaten out his eyes . We found him practicing his  | deadman 's float , the cops would explain when they brought Captain andJudy to identify his corpse . But he could swim like a fish , Captain would tell them . I taught him to swim like a fish myself . You can swim like a fish , soldierboy , I told him . Just jump in and swim to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jump , son . Jump . Jump . Jump . Jump , damn it ! Jimbo curls his bare toes over the railing 's edge . The deep end . The deep end . Jimbo shivers . Jump ! Jump ! Jump , goddamn it ! Jimbo slowly raises his arms above his head and stands on tiptoe . Jimbo wants more than anything to be with Captain in the deep end . Jump ! Jump ! Jump , goddamn it ! You 're not going to drown , goddamn it ! Captain shouts and slaps the water with a cupped hand . It sounds like a shot . Jimbo flinches . Jimbo falls . He breaks his fall back onto the bridge with his battered , bloody hand . He screams and rolls over . He can feel the metal soldier in his windbreaker 's pocket stab painfully into his side . Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus , Jimbo cries and curls childlike about his bloody hand . Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh please Jesus oh please Jesus oh please Jesus . When he comes to , Jimbo rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He holds his bloody hand up close before his eyes , trying to see it in the dark . Jesus , he thinks and rests his head back on the pavement . He opens his mouth , letting the cold rain hit the back of his throat . Wonder how long it would take , Jimbo thinks , letting rain puddle in his open mouth . To drown in the rain . Jimbo sits up and for a moment feels faint again . He shakes his head to clear it . He feels around in the darkness until he finds his motorcycle boots . Jimbo throws away his wet socks and after emptying the rain from the boots he slowly and with great difficulty pulls them on with his left hand . He feels dizzy again and lies back down until it passes . When he sits up he carefully peels the blood-soaked sock off his hand . He tries to examine his hand in the darkness . He blows on the hand and then , gently , he kisses the smashed knuckles . He kisses them and softly licks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes salty . Jimbo holds the hand up and slowly turns it
