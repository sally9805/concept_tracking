txt Auto makers are getting set to put through one of their larger new-model price increases in recent years . But unlike a year ago , this time they 're betting consumers will hardly blink an eye . Detroit will soon send its dealers prices for the 1977-model cars , which are already arriving in showrooms and will officially go on sale next month . In June . the " Big Three " auto makers hinted at an increase of up to 6% , or about $350 a car , on the new models . At that time , some industry observers thought that that figure represented a generous ceiling , and that domestic auto makers would come in with only about a 4% jump in prices . Now it has become clear that that was wishful thinking . Just in recent weeks , new cost pressures have been mounting on the auto industry . For one thing , the steel industry 's second price increase in three months caught Detroit flat-footed . Moreover , there are signs that the cost of the badly needed labor peace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . As a result , many industry observers now expect auto makers to come in with close to the full 6% boost , and then some , depending on what marketing ploys they use to push new cars this fall . Unusual Confidence But while auto makers have worried in some recent years that their pricing moves might injure sales , this fall they are confident that strong underlying demand for new cars will overwhelm any consumer resistance . " Pricing just does n't seem to be the problem it was last year , " one Big Three executive says . " The main battle now just seems to be getting the cars out the &or; to meet the demand . " Adds a marketing analyst at a crosstown auto competitor : " Sales are strong and should continue strong next year . If there 's ever been a year to hold a 6% increase , this is it . " This confident , relaxed attitude is quite different from just last fall . Then , Detroit pricing tacticians laced the delicate task of boosting prices on the 1976-model cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off recession-weary consumers who were just beginning to venture back into dealers ' showrooms . Auto makers also hinted at a 6% boost last year , but in the end , they increased new-model prices only 4.5% , or about $250 . And they went to great lengths to blunt the possible psychological impact on consumers by juggling equipment prices and holding down increases in highly visible base model prices . Auto executives had plenty of reason to worry then , too . In the fall of 1974 , for example , they had pushed through an unprecedented 10% price boost , or $500 a car , and shortly thereafter industry sales had gone into their sharpest nosedive in decades . Many industry executives later conceded the big price increase was a major contributor to the slump . Increases in Past This fall 's increase is n't expected to be anywhere near that big , of course . But if the anticipated boost of about 6% is implemented , it would be , on a percentage basis , among the larger increases of the past 20 years . According to statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers ' 1957 model increase averaged 6.9% . Since then  --  except for the now-famous 1975 model increase ? the next-largest boosts were 5.9% on 1971 cars and 5.1% on 1974s . Most have been under 4% . The most persuasive reason for the industry 's optimism that this fall 's price rise wo n't hurt sales is simply the continuing strength of demand . After two poor sales years , Detroit is reaping the benefits of many previously postponed car purchases . The upturn in the economy and a rebound in consumer confidence have sent the public trooping back to the showrooms in increasing numbers all year . Auto sales experts have raised their sales predictions repeatedly this year . They now look for 1976 new-car deliveries ( including imports ) to reach as high as 10.8 million , up 26% from last year 's 8.6 million . And they are forecasting more of the same . Some executives , for example , have predicted 1977 sales could hit 11.5 million cars , topping 1973 's record 11.4 million . Relaxed Dealers If their own sales forecasts are n't enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field that consumers do n't seem worried about car prices right now , Dealers , for example , are rarely reluctant to squawk when they think Detroit is making it hard for them to sell cars . And " when we hinted at 6% in , June , there was hardly a ripple of protest from our dealers , " says a spokesman for one General Motors Corp . car , division . " Car prices just do n't seem to be a major factor in buying a car these days , " agrees Bill Atamian , a Boston dealer for Ford Motor Co . Adds Hugh Gibson , a Cleveland Ford dealer : " Buyers are pretty well resigned to paying more this fall , " Consumer surveys support this view . " People are n't satisfied with high prices , but they 've become used to price Increases , " says Jay Schmiedeskamp , who supervises the University of Michigan 's respected consumer sentiment surveys , " A 6% increase in autos would be in line with the overall inflation rate recently and would n't have much of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer psychology is a break for Detroit . Any earlier . thoughts that might have been given to holding down prices on 1977 models were wiped out by the most recent steel price increase , auto executives say . In June , steel companies raised prices on flat-rolled and bar products , both essential to auto manufacturing , by nearly 7% . Then  --  to auto makers ' surprise and dismay ? U.S. Steel Corp . earlier this month announced another 4.5% increase in flat-rolled goods . " We anticipated maybe a 2% steel increase late this year , " one Big Three executive says , " but this latest increase hit us like a bolt out of the blue . It has forced us to go hack and take another look at our 1977 pricing plans . " In addition to rising steel costs , auto makers say they have also taken recent " good doses " on copper , aluminum and zinc ? all materials vital to making an auto . Early this month , for example , key aluminum producers raised prices of unalloyed aluminum ingot and various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 9% ( aluminum is being used in greater amounts in autos these days as Detroit tries to cut the weight of its products to improve fuel economy 1 . Tire Prices May Rise Tire prices also may go up . Tire companies and the United Rubber Workers union recently reached a proposed settlement that would increase worker wages and benefits about 36% over three years . and auto makers expect the rubber companies to pass along some of those higher costs . Moreover , the auto industry faces higher labor costs of its own . Both the auto companies and the UAW have indicated they would like to reach a settlement on new contracts this fall without a strike , but the price of peace may be high . The union has recently unveiled some specific and costly demands for a series of extra days off and for a major overhaul of the industry 's supplemental unemployment benefit funds for laid-off workers . Though it 's far too soon to say with certainty , some Wall Street auto analysts think Detroit 's labor costs ultimately could jump as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So some auto executives are even starting to wonder if they have boxed themselves in on their 1977 prices . " If the 6% estimate was high when we first mentioned it , it has been used up now , " a Detroit financial man says . " And if it was just right , then we need more than that now . " Further Boost Possible As a result , some observers think Detroit might try for a further price increase later on if its initial boost is eroded by further cost increases . This tactic has been used in some past years when costs jumped faster than anticipated . But whether any second boost will stick depends largely on General Motors , the acknowledged price pace-setter with more than half the domestic market . For example , Ford Motor tried pushing through a second-round price increase on 1976 cars last winter , but GM refused to go along . Consequently , Ford was forced to rescind the increase in January . One GM source says that currently the No. 1 auto maker is leaning toward a one-time increase on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anticipated costs of ) the UAW contract in one shot . " Flow auto makers choose to implement some of their pricing decisions this fall will also affect how they are received by consumers and how well they cover costs . Industry analysts say they expect a " straightforward " increase for the most part , with the bigger price rises on models that have been selling best recently . At the same time , these sources say auto makers will be " conservative " in pricing cars that have n't been as successful . For example , one Chrysler Corp . dealer says he has received a tentative price on a 1977 van  --  currently a popular model  --  that is about 12% above a comparably equipped 1976 model . Meanwhile , he says , the price of a slower-moving station wagon model that has been shipped to him appears to be up only about 2.5% . Other Pricing Ploys Auto makers may also recover some costs by reducing what car buyers get for their money . For example , Chrysler recently disclosed it was S scaling back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are signs the potential profitability of some models may be increased by forcing consumers to buy betterequipped versions . For example , the base version of GM 's 1977 Vega subcompact this fall will be available this fall only with a more powerful engine and four-speed transmission  --  equipment that was optional previously . One key unanswered question is how GM will price its new full-sized cars , which are about 700 pounds lighter and nearly . a foot shorter than the comparable 1976 models . Some GM-watchers think the company will keep its traditional price gap between the new full-sized cars and its intermediatesized models , even though both series will have very similar outside dimensions .
