In Washington , D.C. , a great new museum by I.M. Pei <P> America 's contribution to the language of modern architecture has been immense . But little sign of that could be seen in its capital , Washington . Where were the modern designs to rival the dominant idioms of 18th century Georgian and 19th century Beaux-Arts by the Potomac ? There was not much to see . The preferred manner , in a low-horizon city dominated by L'Enfant 's neoclassical plan , was Beaux-Arts thinly covered with a " modernist " veneer : the cake minus the icing . From the postwar office blocks to the alternately coarse and mincing frigidity of the 1971 Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts , the past 30 years of Washington architecture have been a prolonged failure of the bureaucratic imagination . There have been one or two notable exceptions , such as the 1976 National Air and Space Museum by Gyo Obata . But perhaps one more structure was needed to break this bind , to show that a modern building could embody the ceremonial gravity of " official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On June 1 that structure opens to the public . It is , of course , the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. , designed by Architect I.M. Pei at a cost of $94.4 million furnished by Paul Mellon , his late sister and the Mellon Foundation ( TIME , May 8 ) . <P> No other building in recent memory - and especially no other museum building-has been greeted with such a flood of superlatives . Ordinarily this would be cause for suspicion ; yet , one can not tour the East Building without sensing that the volume of praise is justified . I.M. Pei has produced , in the fullest sense of that hackneyed but unavoidable word , a masterpiece-a structure born of sustained and highly analytical thought , exquisitely attuned to its site and architectural surroundings , conveying a sense of grand occasion without the slightest trace of pomposity . It restores the sense of craftsmanship , as distinct from routine fabrication , without which major architecture can not exist . <P> One can not call Pei 's design backward-looking ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects a classical , structure , whose visual meaning turns on the idea of established excellence . It is less a " proposition " than a calm , final statement . In that respect , it is unlike the only comparable museum ( in terms of cost , elaboration and civic importance ) to have been built in recent years , the Pompidou Center in the Beaubourg section of Paris . " Le Pompidoglio , " as the French sardonically call it , turned out to be one of those populist-utopian fantasies of the ' 60s that have not yet been made to work . As a public meeting place , it certainly succeeds . Half Paris has taken to riding up and down its dramatic glass escalator tube , squinting through the pigeon droppings on the curved panes at a superb view of the city .
