txt Can the average American homeowner , facing ever-larger electricity and oil bills , convert his house to solar heating ? " Undoubtedly , " says Charles J. Michal Jr . of Total Environmental Action ( TEA ) , " a good many existing homes could be retrofitted ( to use solar energy ) quite economically . " " Sure it takes some ingenuity , " said Bruce N. Anderson , head of TEA , " and it 's somewhat more difficult- ( than designing a solar system for a new building ) , but it surely can be done and on a relatively large percentage of , existing Mr. Michal , whose New Hampshire-based firm designs solar systems " on a case-by-case basis , " puts the cost at roughly $6,000 for a solar system that could cut fuel bills in half . Robert Cushman , manager of sales engineering for Sol-RTech of Hartford , Vermont , estimates it would take 10 years to recover , by way of lower fuel bills , the " excess " cost of installing solar heating . This " payoff " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes a bill now pending which would give tax credits to homeowners converting to solar energy and if oil and electricity costs continue to spiral up . buildings . " // *Converting to sun power // A bill passed by the House and now before the Senate Banking Committee would grant a tax credit of up to $12,000 to a taxpayer installing solar heating in his home . " We assume , " said Dr. Ron Larson of the Office of Technology Assessment , a congressional agency , " a doubling of fuel costs in the next 20 years , excluding inflation . " Possibly , then , a solar system could pay for itself in less time than experts are willing to predict at the " beginning of the state of the art . " There are problems . Some houses could be relatively easily converted , others could not . The prerequisites , according to experts , include : ? " Absolutely the first thing is that the existing building be insulated to electrical heating standards , or better , " said Mr. Michal . ? Space must exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000-gallon water tank , to store t water heated by the solar collector and to retain the heat . ? " Ideally you should have a south-facing roof , measuring one-third the area of the area in the house to be heated , at roughly 45 degrees to the horizontal , " says Mr. Cushman . Failing this , said both experts , solar collector panels can be mounted on fences or other structures on the lawn or garden . The panels , whether on the roof or elsewhere , must not be shaded by tall trees or other buildings . ? A hot-air heating system is the least expensive to convert , because existing air ducts can be used . Electric or hot water systems are more expensive to replace .
