It had been an extraordinary physical and emotional ordeal for John Dean . Most evenings after the hearings , he and his two attorneys , Robert McCandless and Charles Shaffer , retreated to Dean 's town house in Alexandria , Va . There , Maureen , his brittlely attractive wife who sat somewhat tensely behind Dean in the hearing room , prepared hamburgers . Then Dean and the lawyers went over the day 's testimony and watched evening newscasts but not reruns of the day 's performance . After a hot bath and a rubdown by " Mo , " Dean would get to sleep by 11:30 p.m . Despite the tension , he said he slept well . <P> Shortly after the last session , Dean sank into an easy chair , Maureen near him . He agreed to discuss the personal aspects of his week that was with TIME Correspondent Hays Gorey , who had followed him to his home . The cool , meticulous and rather scholarly-looking Dean of the hearings seemed to fade away , as did ( at least in his own mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unsavory acts . A third Dean emerged , still pleading his case but giving a strangely sentimental picture of his life . <P> What had been the most difficult aspects of the week of testimony ? <P> Physically , the most exhausting thing was to read my opening statement . Emotionally , the most difficult aspects were having to talk about the President of the United States as the truth demanded and having to involve former associates and friends . <P> What sustained him during the week ? <P> I knew what I knew . I had no fear of being tripped up in crossexamination . Really , to tell the truth is the easiest thing in the world . <P> Did he think he was bringing down the Republic or restoring it ? <P> There 's a cloud over this city . Until this cloud is removed , the Government will not operate . This nation will recover only when we get to the bottom of this situation . I look upon myself as one who is helping the process . <P> <P> What thoughts had been running through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I was five or six or seven . I was playing with matches behind the garage . There was lots of brush there . It caught fire and burned down the back of the garage . <P> My father asked me if I had done it . I said no . But of course my father knew I had done it . He sent me to my room , saying " John , we 'll talk again when you are ready to tell the truth . " Then he did a wise thing . While I was in my room , he sent the fire marshal to talk to me . He must have been ten feet tall , wearing a big blue uniform . I can see him to this day . He said to me : " Now , John , you have n't told your father the truth . " The impact of the blue uniform as the authority of the law was enormous . I said to myself : " The jig is up . " <P> I told my father . He said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth emerges . There 's no doubt about it . I expressed the hope today that the Ervin hearings will bring out all the truth , but even if they do not , some day all these facts will come out . <P> What had he relied upon during the ordeal ?
