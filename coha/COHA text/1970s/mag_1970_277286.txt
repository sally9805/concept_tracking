Up from the orchestra floats a vaguely medieval sound : thick , sonorous and brassy . The dancers parade in solemn sequence across the softly lit stage , looking rather like harlequins in leotards . When they reach the footlights , the mood is suddenly jolted by a more familiar noise : the harsh twang of amplified guitars and the racketing thump of a rock beat . What follows this seemingly incongruous prelude is a swirling , eye-and ear-catching panoply of ballet maneuvers , from chastely classic lifts to Broadway shuffles , set to an eclectic score ( by Alan Raph and Lee Holdridge ) that blends the modish and the modal . The climax is a joyous , foot-stamping , yet thoroughly unblasphemous rock version of the Ite , missa est chant that ends the Latin Mass . At the diminuendo finale , the dancers lay rows of votive lights across the stage and drift silently , monkishly , into the wings . <P> Plotless and perhaps even pointless , Gerald Arpino 's Trinity nonetheless represents a throbbing fusion of classic dance with the sound of now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youthful temperament of the New York City Center 's Joffrey Ballet . <P> Improvised Air .
