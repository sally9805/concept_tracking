txt All seven defendants in the Chicago conspiracy trial were acquitted today of plotting to incite a riot here during the 1968 Democratic National Convention , but five of them were convicted of seeking to promote a riot through individual acts . The five men , David T. Del. linger , Rennie C. Davis , Thom. as F. Hayden , Abbie Hoffman and Jerry C. Rubin , were found guilty of crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot and then giving inflammatory speeches for that purpose . , The two other defendants , John R. Froines and Lee Weiner , were acquitted on both the conspiracy and the individual counts . After nearly 40 hours of deliberation , the jury returned its verdict at 12:20 P.M. in the brightly lit courtroom on the 23d floor of Chicago 's Federal Building , where the four-and-ahalf-month trial took place . Appeal Planned William M. Kunstler , one of the defense attorneys , said later that the five convicted defendants would appeal . They face possible penalties of five years in prison , $10,000 fines or both. , It- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' which has aroused passions on all sides . Each side won something . For the defense , it was the Government 's failure to persuade the jury that any conspiracy existed among demonstrators here during the convention . For the Government , it wars the failure of five of the defendants to establish to the jury 's satisfaction that their intent was innocent . The defendants were apparently stunned , not so much by the verdict , but by the jury 's capacity to produce it . Deadlock Expected When the defendants were taken from their cells at Cook County Jail , where they had begun serving sentences for contempt of court , they believed they were to attend a hearing on the defense 's motion to discharge the apparently deadlocked jury . So they , their attorneys and most of the newsmen were astonished when Marshal Ronald Dombrowski announced to the hushed courtroom : " The Jury has reached a verdict , Your Honor . " Before the jury was brought in , Richard G. Schultz , Assistant United States Attorney , asked Judge Julius J. Hoffman to exclude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent the sort of disorders that often judge . He demands that attorneys stay within the rules of evidence . " Later , at a news conference , Mayor Richard J. Daley expressed satisfaction too . The Mayor , one of the first to contend there had been a conspiracy to Cause riot in Chicago , said the verdict proved " that some people did come to our city to create a riot . " Before they- went back ' to jail this afternoon , the defendants were permitted to meet with their lawyers for about an hour in the Federal Building . At a news conference later , Paul Potter , one of the defense witnesses during the trial and a former president of Students for a Democratic Society , read a statement that he said had been written by the defendants . It said : " This outrageous verdict results from the unholy combination of an unconstitutional law , a Daley prosecutor and a hostile authoritarian judge . . . . " Everyone who opposes the war against Vietnam  --  and everyone who advocates the liberation of black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  everyone who condemns the existence of poverty here and throughout the world  --  all have been found guilty by this verdict . " This day will live in infamy . But the final jury is the people and their verdict is already beginning to come in . We await the final verdict of the people . " Terming the verdict " an outrage , ' Mr. Kunstler said it apparently had been a compromise between jurors determined to bring in a conviction and those holding out for acquittal . " Some jurors believed in these defendants , " he sad , " but they were , tired and worn out . " Mr. Kunstler said proof of such a compromise could serve as a ground for appeal . He said the ' defense planned to ask the appeals court for the right to interview jurors about how the verdict . had . been reached . Judge ' Hoffman forbade such contacts today . - Asked about the appeal the defense intends to file , Mr. Kunstler said : " There are so many grounds It really staggers the imagination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the judge ruled to admit Attie prosecution. , eviContinued From Page 1 , Col. 3 erupted during the trial 's tensest moments . Mr. Kunstler argued strenuously that at least the defendant ? wives and girl friends should be allowed to remain . " It would be the last crowning indignity of this trial , " he said , " to make these men face this moment in a courtroom surrounded only by marshals and lawyers . At this moment , no man should be alone . I beg and implore you ' to reject the Government 's motion . " But Judge Hoffman quickly approved the motion , and Federal marshals promptly moved towards four young women seated in the third row of the press section : Abbie Hoffman 's wife , .. Anita ; Mr. Rubin 's girl friend , Nancy Kurshan ; Mr. Welner 's girl friend , Sharon Avery ; and Mr. Dellinger 's 13-year-old daughter , Michelle . As a marshal reached for Anita Hoffman , she stood and shouted at the defendants : " You will be avenged . " Then , as marshals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge and shouted : " We 'll dance on your grave , Julie . " Love You ' " I love you , " ? Michelle Dellinger called to her father as she was ejected . Screams and shouts could be heard from the corridor outside as the women were pushed into elevators and ejected from the building . A , minute later , three mar-I shals seized Mr. Froines'sj mother-in-law , who had been sitting quietly farther back , and half-dragged , half-lifted her from the courtroom . Then , with only the defendants , the lawyers , about 40 carefully screened newsmen and about 20 marshals in the room , Judge Hoffman called in the jury . After the 10 women and two men had taken their places in the jury box , where they sat for 20 weeks until last Saturday , Judge Hoffman asked whom they had selected as their foreman . Edward F. Kratzke , a floridfaced cleaner - for the Chicago Transit Authority , handed ' the written verdicts to Tony Bryce , the judge 's clerk . Then Mr. Bryce , a stooped , elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear in witnesses and rap for silence , began to read the verdicts in a piping voice . " We the jury , " he read , " find the defendant David T. Dellinger guilty as charged on Count No. 2 and not guilty on Count No. 1 . " There was a small gasp around the defense table and. , several defendants leaned over to whisper to the 54-year-old pacifist , who sat upright in his leather chair wearing the same brown tweed sports jacket he has worn during much of the trial . Mr. Davis greeted his verdict with a tight-lipped grin . Mr. Hayden was expressionless under his tousled hair . Mr. Hoffman appeared despondent behind a two-day growth of beard , and Mr. Rubin , the normally ebullient Yippie , seemed on the verge of tears . When Mr. Weiner 's acquittal was announced the other defendants applauded and turned with broad grins toward the bearded sociology teacher , clapping him on the arm and tousling his hair . " Pm happy for you , Lee , " ? said Mr. Davis . The last defendant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdict . When the acquittal was announced , he snapped upright , smiling and shaking his head incredulously . A minute later , the husky , red-haired chemistry professor buried his head in his arms on the table , and his shoulders heaved with sobs . When the verdicts had been read , Leonard I. Weinglass , the other defense attorney , asked that the jury be polled . Mr. Bryce asked the jurors if their votes had been correctly recorded , and one by one they said , " Yes , they were , " or simply , " Yes . " Several of the jurors looked haggard and drawn from their long deliberations . Mrs. Jean Fritz , a housewife from Des Plaines , Ill. , who was widely believed to be sympathetic to the defendants , seemed to have been weeping . When the last of the jurors had affirmed the verdict , Judge Hoffman dismissed them , expressing his " deep appreciation " for their long labors . As they filed from the room . Mr. Dellinger , Mr. Froines ? and Mr. Davis stood in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Hoffman then announced that at 10 A.M. Friday he would determine the impact of admitted Government wiretapping on the case . Before the trial began last September , the defense asked the judge to dismiss the Government 's case because much of the evidence allegedly come from illegal wiretapping . But the judge said ? such a ruling would be required onry if the trial produced convictions and said he would ruts on the issue after a verdict . He is expected to reject the defense motion . The judge set no date tor sentencing , but presumably it will take place sometime next week . Judge Hoffman rejected a defense motion for bond pending appeal . " From the evidence in this case , from their conduct in this trial , " he said , " I conclude that these are dangerous men to be at large . " Even if bond had been granted on today 's convictions , the defendants would have had to go back to Cook County jail on contempt sentences imposed earlier . An appeal of the contempt convictions will be filed soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit will grant bail pending appeal on that offense . At a news conference later , Thomas A. Form the United States Attorney , said , " the verdict ? proved that the jury system works . " He said this was true even if it turned out that the jurors had reached a compromise . " I am satisfied because we got a verdict . If the verdict appears to be a compromise that 's the *ay the system works . Everybody 's feelings are in the verdict , " he said . Mr. Foram said he believed Judge Hoffman conducted the trial fairly , althougn he , conAssistant separate Richard G. Schultz , left , defense attorney , holding The New York Times United States Attorney , and William M. news conferences after verdicts were handed ( by Gary Settle ) Kunstler , down . dence and against the defense 's . " , Mr. Kunstler also emphasized that the five defendants had been convicted not for anything they did in Chicago but for what they said . " It was all speeches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches in churches around the country . All we have left is what the Government is most afraid of  --  speech . " . ? The five so-called ' " substantive counts " on which the defendants were convicted refer to 13 speeches that the defendants gave between Aug. 1 and Aug. 28 , 1968 : Four by Mr. Davis , three by Mr. Hoffman , three by Mr. Rubin , two by Mr. Hayden and one by Mr. Dellinger . The speeches given before the convention , which took place Aug. 26 to Aug. 29 , urged people to come to Chicago to participate in demonstrations . The speeches during  --  the convention were generally made to groups in Grant or Lincoln Parks , urging them to . action . For example , a plainclothesman testified that on the evening of Aug. 26 in Grant Park he heard Mr. Davis yell over a bullhorn to a crowd around an equestrian statue : " Take the hill . Take the high ground . Do n't let the nies take the hill . If the police want a riot they can stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riot ' they can leave the area . " According to other testimony , Mr. Rubin told a crowd in Lincoln Park that same night : " The pigs started the violence , but tonight the people are n't going to give up the park . We have to fight them . They have guns and sticks so we have to arm ourselves with rocks , sticks and everything we can get " On Aug. 28 , according to testimony , Mr. Hayden told a crowd , " If blood is going to flow , let 's make sure it flows all over this stinking city .
