It was not so long ago-a matter of 20 years-that art nouveau was considered a minor style , deservedly forgotten . Those tendriled doorknobs and flowing pedestals , that panoply of rare materials ( zebrawood , pte de verre , lapis lazuli , champlev enamel ) , that air of hothouse elegance , glazed and nuanced-what did such things amount to but decoration ? And what was decoration but a sin against the purity of modern art ? <P> The life of art nouveau was short , about two decades ; its climax was the turn of the century , in 1900 . But in that brief time the look of Western capitals-and especially their bourgeois interiors-was utterly transformed by architects led by Victor Horta and Hector Guimard , designer of the Paris Metro entrances ; poster artists like Privat Livemont and Alphonse Mucha ; designers of jewelry like Ren Lalique ; glassmakers and ceramists like Louis Comfort Tiffany , Emile Gall and Felix Bracquemond . A new style of luxury art , the last great mannerism , had been found . Because of a hostility to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Czanne and the post-impressionists were its contemporaries , art nouveau was long dismissed by those who believed that cultural history is only or mainly written in paintings . <P> But history follows trade . The popularity of art nouveau , revived in the ' 60s , has provoked an enormous curiosity about the style . What was the taste of 1900 ? Where did it originate ? Was it , after all , as effete as we were told ? No exhibition , now or in the near future , is likely to satisfy that curiosity better than " Art Nouveau : Belgium/France , " which opened last week at the Art Institute of Chicago . Organized by both the Art Institute and the Institute for the Arts at Houston 's Rice University ( where it was shown last spring ) , it is a collective effort of numerous curators , headed by Yvonne Brunhammer from the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris . It contains more than 700 items by scores of artists-a brilliant array of objects , most of which have never been on display in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Historian Victor Beyer suggests in the catalogue , " while art nouveau is its gesture , its spasm . " Even at this distance , one can sense how liberating the gesture must have seemed : an escape from the thick , relentlessly overstuffed world of Second Empire Paris into an imagery of free movement and rhythmic arabesque . The art nouveau line-whiplike , airy , eddying back on itself-was common to high art as well . A good example is Gauguin 's portrait of the painter Roy , 1889 , with its serpentine forms of background and hair ( see color page ) . <P> Dragonflies and Chic . Such serpentine curves had been discovered by the French in Japanese art : the first shops for japonaiserie had been set up in Paris in the 1870s . Moreover , the designers of the Belle Epoque seized on the reverence for ephemeral nature in Japanese art , importing a fresh iconography of fugitive things : mist , shivering grasses , winding shoots , morning glories and insects . Nowhere is their passion for the impalpable better expressed than in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , designed for Tiffany by Clara Driscoll around 1900.
