txt In a display of party unity and peace , Democrats took only one ballot Wednesday night to nominate the man they hope will lead them to a political rebirth ? Jimmy Carter of Georgia . Carter sat in a hotel suite , his mother Lillian and his daughter beside him , his grandson in his lap , and watched on three television sets as Ohio put him over the top . His smile widened and he put his arm around his mother . It was a magnificent night for the former governor , culminating the long year that began in the snow and ice of Iowa and New Hampshire and the cool question " Jimmy Who ? " EVERYTHING seemed to be falling into place . In the most dramatic moment of the night , Rep. Morris Udall of California broke the tradition that candidates do n't appear at the convention and took the podium to release his delegates and announce his support for Carter . California Gov . Edmund Brown Jr . spoke from his delegation on the floor after Carter was over the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attractive wife Rosalynn saw the victory from Madison Square Garden 's VIP section . Happy but tearful she told an interviewer , " The one thing I miss is that Jimmy is not here with me . . . . That 's hard . " A few moments after Carter 's nomination was announced , reporters in his suite in the Americana Hotel asked him if he had selected his running mate . " Pretty much , " Carter said . Then sticking to his well-kept secret , he added , " I have n't told anyone yet . " He said he would not notify either his choice or the other five finalists until morning . A REPORTER asked , " Do you reserve the right to change your mind ? " and Carter replied that he did . Carter scheduled a news conference . Thursday morning to announce his choice . Carter said he did not know whether the running mate would be present at the news conference . Even as the voting began on the presidential nominations late Wednesday night , he met with top aides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALTHOUGH THE choice was the convention 's only suspense , it was a suspense borne without to much apparent suffering by the delegates and at least one of the half dozen vice presidential hopefuls . While Sen. Frank Church of Idaho wore a telephone beeper when he went to dinner so he would not miss any Carter call , and another possibility , Sen. Walter Mon-dale of Minnesota holed up to avoid reporters , Sen. Adlai Stevenson of Illinois found it a bit of a yawn . " I must say the suspense is not causing me to lose any sleep , " said Stevenson . " In fact , it 's causing me to go to sleep . " THE CARTER triumph , which seemed impossible when he announced his candidacy as a former one-term governor of Georgia who was unknown nationally , was based on a carefully engineered campaign strategy . But Hamilton Jordan , the 31-year-old campaign manager who was mobbed on the floor , choked with emotion as he said " Nobody could have done it but Jimmy . " Carter received 2,2381/2 votes . Udall was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1391/2 votes for other candidates . The vote was made unanimous on a motion from the Georgia delegation after Brown made the ceremonial gesLure of turning over almost all of California 's votes to Carter . CARTER HAS promised to come out steaming in a campaign against President Ford or Ronald Reagan , whichever the Republicans end up selecting next month in Kansas City . In an emotional moment earlier in the day , in a quiet talk to fellow Georgians before the noise and the victory in Madison Square Garden , Carter said , " I do n't intend to lose this election . " And so for the 51-year-old former Navy officer and peanut farmer , the night meant a new beginning . Shortly after 9 p. an . Rep. Peter Rodino N. J. , the dapper chairman of the Nixon impeachment hearings , mounted the podium in the bunting-draped Madison Square Garden to put Carter 's name in nomination . " My friends , these are no ordinary times , and we can not settle . in these times for an ordinary leader , " said Rodino , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is an Italian-American Roman Catholic from a northeastern industrial state . " CONFIDENT IN my heart and mind , I offer you tonight a man with a new dimension of leadership , " Rodino declared , " a sensitivity to the mood and direction of the country , a leader with a vision of the possibilities of our nation , and the heart and courage to pursue that vision , a leader with concern and compassion for the denied and the deprived among our people , a leader with the character and purpose to translate that vision and that compassion into dynamic progress for the American people . " Delegates wearing Carter straw skimmers and waving peanut signs put on a two-minute stand-in-place demonstration as Mrs. Carter applauded and smiled . The long drum-beating parades that enlivened old conventions have been banned as irrelevent to the times . In seconding the nomination , Rep. Andrew Young Ala. who has been one of Carter 's closest black advisers , said , " I am ready to lay down the burden of race , and Jimmy Carter comes from a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has done just that . " CARTER , THE Southern outsider , had only nominal opposition in the balloting Wednesday night  --  from Gov . Edmund " Gerry " Brown of California ; Ellen McCormack , the anti-abortion candidate ; and Rep. Morris Udall Ariz . . Minutes before the convention opened Wednesday night one of a cluster of blue Udall balloons slipped away , floated gently to the ceiling and popped in a case of terminal symbolism . Udall , once the hope of many liberals , finished second in many primaries but was unable to win one . His name was put in nomination by Archibald Cox , the Harvard law professor fired by President Nixon as special Watergate prosecutor . The tall , crew-cut Cox described Udall as a gallant candidate whose " defeat is more triumphant than victory . For he proved that a public figure , even in political contest , can exemplify the best of the spirit of liberty ; that honor need not surrender to ambition . . . and that humility should go hand in hand with power . " BROWN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zen Buddhism , was asked by a delegate a few hours before the call of states if he was " still running for President . " " Yes , " Brown replied although he added later in a stroke of realism , " I think the ballot tonight will dispose of my situation rather decisively . " Nominating Mrs. McCormack , the New York housewife who campaigned exclusively against abortions , James Killilea charged that ' Democrats " have read Catholics out of the party " with a platform plank he regarded as pro-abortion . In a break with tradition whereby candidates do n't appear at the convention , Udall touched off a longer demonstration than Carter 's by appearing in person to second his own nomination . UDALL SAID HE was here to make sure that in the next 100 days the party " stayed together " to administer a beating to Republicans . He said he would do everything he can to get Carter elected . " Carter will make a good President , and I am behind him . " Udall said . The convention was obviously in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sen. Edward M. Kennedy Mass. got a hand as he made his first appearance in the hall , sitting in the visitors section with Robert F. Kennedy 's widow , Ethel , and other members of the family . Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was there in a deep red dress . There were balloons , banners , and members of the Carter family . Jimmy Carter 's brother , Billy , who has described himself as the beer-drinkers ' candidate and who has said he is happier as a country boy back in Plains , Ga. , than in Manhattan , was dressed for the occasion in suit and vest . But he could n't resist needling a television interviewer who cornered him on the floor . The NBC-TV interviewer , asked Billy to tell him who his brother 's vice presidential choice would be . Billy , with an actor 's timing , leaned forward to whisper " Sam Donaldson , " an ABC correspondent . ON THIS SPECIAL day , Carter met with fellow Georgians in his states delegation and said , in a voice brittle with emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He spoke of the loneliness of campaigning when " not many people thought I had a chance . But a lot of you thought I had a chance . " When I first started , I told a lot of people I did n't intend to lose the nomination . And I can tell you today , I do n't intend to lose the election . " Many Democratic politicians are guessing that Muskie is the vice presidential choice because of his religion . But the consensus on Carter 's staff is that Mondale it is.
