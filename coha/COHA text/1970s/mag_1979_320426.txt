Very few football teams use an eight-three defense these days . But if one should , there is a fine running play against it in which the quarterback fakes to a running back , who moves off tackle to take out the outside linebacker , and then-wait a minute , those blackboard chalk lines resemble old Ski Nose himself . <P> Which is probably why Alabama Coach Bear Bryant , whose defenses are more sophisticated and whose team , as a result , is so far No.l this year , looked skeptical when Bob Hope dropped by to outline the Ski Nose slant for the Crimson Tide . Hope was in Tuscaloosa filming for a Nov. 19 NBC-TV special , Bob Hope on Campus , which is all about cornerbacks , coeds and the kind of school spirit that Dionne Warwick and the Village People generate . But if it was all for fun , why was Joe Namath , the Bear 's most famous alumni quarterback and Hope 's partner in the special , scrutinizing that eight-three prevent defense so seriously ? <P> <P> " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've been to a few . Thank God this one was mine . " So saying , a beaming Bette Midler clenched a rose in her teeth like a kitschy Carmen . The flower was not accidental . Midler 's first movie , The Rose , all about a downhill rocker who finally ODs and drops dead onstage , had just opened in New York to favorable reviews . So Midler was being majestically feted at a post-premiere dinner party . At the Roseland Ballroom , of course . With 2,999 other real roses decorating the dance floor in addition to the one in Midler 's mouth . <P> <P> Atlanta 's Emory University , a 143-year-old Methodist institution with an enrollment of 7,500 , has been described as " Coca-Cola U. " because of periodic endowments it receives from home from the crosstown Coca-Cola Co . The latest donation to C-C U. last week was enough to slake the thirst of less-carbonated , better-known institutions like Harvard or Yale . Gruff Robert Woodruff , 89 , who spent one year at Emory , then dropped out to pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chairmanship , presented the school with 3 million shares of Coke stock valued at $100 million . There has never been an individual donation of that magnitude to any American school . Said Emory President James T. Laney , unable to swallow his bubbly reaction : " We 're encouraging everyone to drink Coke . " <P> <P> Penelope Pulls It Off was perhaps Bergman 's most memorable film ; its Anglo-German cast , insisted the director , was engaged not in porn but in a mere " nudie romp . " Ingmar Bergman ? Hardly , but close . The romping Penelope is the famed film director 's daughter Anna , 29 , who left Sweden 15 years ago to pursue her own career . So far , it has consisted mostly of nude modeling , skin flicks and dumb-blond roles on English TV . But Bergman may yet need the wardrobe department as she prepares to play a part , she boasts , that will " put me on the map . " It is in a genuine Bergman movie , she says , so far undisclosed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Record <P> Charles L. Schultze , presidential economic adviser , on the state of the economy : " It 's the case of the missing recession . It 's out there somewhere , but nobody can find it . "
