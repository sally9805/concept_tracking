A notable byproduct of Japan 's swift rise to economic superpower status is a mildly bizarre cult of the price tag . Some of the best customers of art galleries on Madison Avenue and the Faubourg St. Honor these days are dealers from Tokyo or Osaka , their pockets stuffed with yen , who are willing to pay astronomical sums for French impressionist paintings . Japanese buyers are equally conspicuous at the yearling auctions in Saratoga and Deauville , bidding handsomely for the best thoroughbreds . In fact , the Japanese seem to have supplanted the stereotype Texans as the world 's most eager status seekers . <P> One man who has shrewdly exploited his compatriots ' fixation on expensive luxuries is Keishiro Funakoshi , proprietor of the Akaneya Coffee Shop in scenic Karuizawa , a popular mountain resort 100 miles northwest of Tokyo . There , for 9,900 yen ( roughly $38 ) , he serves what must surely be the world 's most expensive cup of coffee . Funakoshi readily concedes that it is not so much the quality of his coffee ( a home-blended brew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decor of his establishment ( a narrow , dark wooden hut decorated in rustic Mingei style ) , as the defiantly exorbitant prices that attract hordes of tourists to his coffee shop . <P> " People come to Karuizawa with the expectation of spending money , " he says , " so why should n't I help them in this endeavor ? " Even those who do not sample the $38 cup of coffee-served at a special table by a kimono-clad waitress in a ritual that resembles a tea ceremony-can leave the Akaneya with the feeling of having been overcharged . <P> A weaker brew , served in less ornate cups , costs a steep 495 yen ( more than three times the standard price ) when taken at the counter . That is where the majority of Funakoshi 's customers sit , hoping to see someone come in and order the special $38 cup . Hardly anyone complains about the high prices . As Funakoshi explains it : " Compared to 9,900 yen , 495 is a real bargain . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
