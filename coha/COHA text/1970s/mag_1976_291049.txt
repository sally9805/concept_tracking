Is there a better way ? This week representatives of the League of Women Voters will meet with agents from the Ford and Carter camps to chew over changes that could make the next two debates ( on Wednesday Oct. 6 and Friday Oct. 22 ) more exciting and informative . There is , of course , no way of overcoming the limitations of television , which is simply not a medium suited to rational explanation of complex subjects . At any rate , the White House , figuring that Ford won Round 1 and should do well in the future , likes the old format just fine . Carter 's forces by week 's end had not yet made it known if they favored reform . But a lot of other experts had ideas : <P> . &gt;Eliminate the questioners . Thus , the candidates could engage each other more forcefully and directly . ABC Correspondent Frank Reynolds , one of the three journalists who interrogated Carter and Ford , proposes that the candidates agree on a list of topics ahead of time and debate with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could toss a coin to see who starts off and then let them go at each other . " Adds Journalism Professor Edward P. Bassett of the University of Southern California : " All that 's needed is an interlocutor who can keep them at each other 's throat . " But another panelist , New Yorker Correspondent Elizabeth Drew , disagrees . Says she : " At least we had the opportunity to inject reality . I do n't think it would be too good to have Ford saying , ' Jimmy , is it true you want to increase spending to the sky ? ' Or Carter asking , ' Mr. Ford , why do n't you put Americans to work ? ' " <P> &gt;Speed up the debates . Rita E. Hauser , the Manhattan lawyer who headed the committee that set up the debate , urges that the others be cut from 90 minutes to an hour and that follow-up questions be eliminated because they slowed the exchange . <P> &gt;Ask tougher questions . Robert Hughes , Republican chairman of Ohio 's Cuyahoga County , which includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many soft questions at the candidates . " Where were the tough questions ? Abortion . Busing . Playboy . The purpose of these debates is to challenge these two guys , and that was n't done . " <P> &gt;Permit quicker , easier rebuttals . Former CBS Anchorman Bill Shadel suggests that the candidates be given more time to reply to each other 's statements . Says he : " To give a man two or three minutes without allowing a prompt rebuttal invites campaign speeches rather than confrontation . " In addition , Ronald Matlon , a debate expert at the University of Massachusetts , recommends that the candidates be allowed to question each other directly . <P> &gt; Make the debates less formal . New York Campaign Consultant Tony Schwartz considers the format antique , " the difference between opera and jazz , " and unsuited to television . Says he : " They should have the two candidates sitting down in a relaxed way with perhaps one moderator and just talking . But the candidates were very rigidly handled . It was dehumanizing to see the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
