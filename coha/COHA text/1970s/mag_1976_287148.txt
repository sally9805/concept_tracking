The spartan cell is no different from that of any ordinary inmate at the Tokyo House of Detention-a 6-ft. by 9-ft. concrete cubicle furnished with two tatami mats , a collapsible table and a toilet . Former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka 's new quarters were a long way from the exquisitely landscaped home across town where he lived until his arrest last week . Yet the House of Detention was not wholly unfamiliar to " Kaku-san , " as he was once affectionately nicknamed . In 1948 , as a brash young member of the Japanese Diet , he spent three weeks there on charges stemming from a coal industry bribe scandal . His return in abject disgrace brought to full circle the most extraordinary political career in postwar Japan . <P> Tanaka 's success was built on what the Japanese call kinken-money power , meaning jobs , contracts and very often raw cash liberally applied to advance political aims . Money has always played a key role in Japanese politics ; Tanaka , a horse trader 's son who lacked both the prestigious education and family connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than most . But when , in the past few years , a recession at home and the example of Watergate abroad made the Japanese more sensitive to the private morals of their public leaders , Tanaka 's fall became inevitable . <P> A native of a sleepy town in Niigata prefecture , Kaku-san went to Tokyo at the age of 15 with only a grade school education and less than $3 in his pocket . By the time he was 19 , the cocky , hardworking Tanaka owned a contracting business . During World War II , his firm was big enough to handle a $20 million contract for the Japanese army in Korea . In 1947 he became a member of the Diet by bankrolling his way through a lower house election . <P> The next year , Tanaka made his first trip to the Tokyo House of Detention ; acquitted of the bribery charges against him , he soon resumed his rise-to Postal Minister , Finance Minister , and , at 54 , the youngest Prime Minister in postwar Japanese history . By the reckoning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than $34 million in 1972 in the form of loans and cash gifts to fellow members of the Liberal Democratic Party to secure his selection as party president-and hence automatically as Prime Minister . <P> Tanaka 's folksy ways and humble origins appealed then to the press and public alike . Earthy in speech and impatient in manner ( the Japanese , he once said , " must learn the art of coming to the point as fast as possible " ) , he built up a cando , populist image . Although he was popular and admired , Kaku-san was never able to free himself of the whiff of financial scandal . Typical was the Shinano-Gawa riverbed case of 1964 . A nameless company bought an abandoned tract of dry land in the Shinano River , then made a killing later on when the government revealed railroad and highway projects that caused land prices to skyrocket ; the company also turned out to have a former secretary to Tanaka on its board of directors . Though accused repeatedly of corruption , Tanaka until last week always managed to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his kinken record in a Japanese magazine , describing dummy corporations , secret bank accounts and false tax statements , triggered a party revolt that forced him from office .
