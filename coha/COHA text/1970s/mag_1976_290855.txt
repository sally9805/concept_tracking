A wry little riddle is circulating in Lisbon these days about General Antonio Ramalho Eanes , 41 , who has stepped down as army Chief of Staff to be a candidate in Portugal 's June 27 presidential election . Question : " Why does Eanes always wear dark glasses ? " Answer : " To hide his monocle . " In fact , Eanes no longer wears his ominously familiar shades these days , but there are nonetheless several points to the quip . One is that Eanes ( rhymes with Janice ) is now the overwhelming favorite to become the country 's next President , a post held by monocled General Antonio de Spinola until he was ousted by his fellow officers in a bloodless coup in September 1974 . Another is that several key aides of the exiled right-wing general are involved in Eanes ' campaign , which has been endorsed by the country 's three largest parties : Mrio Scares ' Socialists , the Popular Democrats and the conservative Center Social Democrats . <P> Absolute Majority . Eanes , according to one recent poll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election . Although about 38% of the electorate is still undecided , the current Premier , Admiral Jose Pinheiro de Azevedo-who is not backed by any political party but is counting on his personality to put him across-is favored by 14% of the voters ; ultra-leftist Army Major Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho should get 11 % of the vote . The Communist candidate , Octavio Pato , the party 's No. 2 man and considered more acceptable than Stalinist Party Boss Alvaro Cunhal , trails with a mere 3% . If Eanes does not get an absolute majority , he will then face a runoff election , probably with Pinheiro de Azevedo-a contest that everyone expects the former Chief of Staff to win handily . <P> The election is Portugal 's third in the past 14 months , and potentially its most significant . In April 1975 , the voters chose a Constituent Assembly that drafted a new constitution . A year later , they elected 263 members of a new Parliament . Now they will pick the country 's first freely elected President in nearly half a century-an act that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sporadic violence that has besieged the country since the revolution of April 1974 . <P> If Eanes becomes President , it will be less because the voters like him than because they fear the alternatives . A stern , aloof , ramrod-stiff disciplinarian , Eanes served in all three of Portugal 's former African territories , joined the 1973 so-called " captains ' revolt " against Lisbon 's effort to contain the black struggle for independence , and actively supported Spinola at the time of the April revolution . Eanes is credited with lancing the rebellion last November that nearly led to a leftist dictatorship . <P> But popularity has not followed widespread gratitude . The rallies organized by supporting parties on his behalf have been poorly attended . Much of the front-line campaigning for the general has been carried on by his civilian supporters . The most notable is Scares , whom Eanes has promised to appoint Premier if he wins .
