Such is his impact on international affairs that almost anything said by Henry Kissinger is bound to attract widespread attention and comment . Last week-perhaps inadvertently , perhaps not-the Secretary of State managed to trigger a worldwide uproar . In a lengthy Business Week interview , Kissinger responded to a question about possible U.S. military intervention against the oil producers by cautiously noting that this would be " a very dangerous course . " But then , using a complicated-not to mention cryptic-triple negative , he added : " I am not saying that there is no circumstance where we would not use force . But it is one thing to use it in the case of a dispute over price , it 's another where there 's some actual strangulation of the industrial world . " <P> Although the remark on possible intervention was just a very small part of a lengthy interview , it was picked up and headlined by newspapers and wire services around the world . Standing alone , the statement almost seemed as if Kissinger were already mobilizing troops . The reaction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise doomed to failure , " thundered Algerian President Houari Boumedienne , reacting to his own reading of the Kissinger statement . " Gunboat policies , " ridiculed Pravda . Egypt 's President Anwar Sadat warned that the oil-producing Arab nations would blow up their wells rather than let them be seized by U.S. forces . Rome worried that American intervention might risk nuclear war with the Soviets . In London , political leaders of all parties were privately troubled by what they felt was Kissinger 's flirtation with " brinkmanship . " Only the Israelis expressed satisfaction . " It was a good statement , " said former Intelligence Chief Harm Herzog . " It makes the Arabs think twice . " <P> Doomsday Prospect . Under close analysis , the Kissinger statement did not seem to warrant such a reaction . In a sense , it merely expressed the obvious . It is hard to see how Kissinger could have ruled out military action absolutely under any circumstances . A sovereign power must retain the option of using force if and when its survival , or that of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or country , carries in the back of his mind the idea that if his life or livelihood is threatened , he will use all the means at his disposal to protect himself , " observed Harvard Professor of Government Nadav Safran . Kissinger 's remarks only repeated what he had said before on a " background " basis . They also were consistent with his earlier statements about the doomsday prospect facing the industrialized democracies of the West because of " economic strangulation " - that is , national bankruptcies and the possible collapse of representative government as a result of continued high oil prices or a new embargo . <P> Despite their public stance last week ( taken to appease the Arabs ) , a number of European officials privately agreed with Kissinger . They acknowledged that if their economic situation became " extreme , " they would not oppose U.S. military action to avoid " actual economic strangulation . " One major European government reportedly has already prepared a contingency plan to support U.S. intervention .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
