AGAIN , Chicago . Again , a deeply symbolic conflict , an emotional and ideological division in the country . After the 1968 Democratic Convention , Americans were divided between those who backed the police against what seemed to them the outrageous and obscene attacks of young rioters , and those who felt that the demonstrators had been brutalized by Mayor Richard Daley 's cops . This time , Americans were divided between those who saw Federal Judge Julius Hoffman as upholding the American judicial system and the sanctity of the courts against outrageous , sometimes filthy attacks by the Chicago Seven ; and those who thought that , however impossible their behavior , the defendants were being victimized by a bad law and a biased judge . From all possible indications , the vast majority backed the cops then , and back Hoffman now . Without question , the Seven did indeed deliberately and dangerously assault the System-a System that , for all its faults , does protect dissenters and minorities . But the issue could not and did not end there . <P> As the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many feel when he denounced the Chicago defendants as " anarchists and social misfits " during a speech at a Republican fund-raising dinner in St. Paul . " Fortunately for America , " said Agnew , " the system proved equal to the challenge . That jury came in with an American result . " New York 's Mayor John Lindsay was of a different mind . " All of us , I think , see in that trial a tawdry parody of our judicial system , " he said . " When a trial becomes fundamentally an examination of political acts and beliefs , then guilt or innocence becomes almost irrelevant . " Protests , many of them violent , broke out against the Chicago convictions in cities and on campuses around the land . The trial was not only a symptom of the division in America ; it also deepened it . <P> The five months of testimony and argument had barely come to an end , with the jury dispatched to ponder its verdict , when Judge Hoffman began handing out contempt-of-court sentences that ranged from two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 days for David Dellinger . With characteristic , outrageous hyperbole , Dellinger protested : the System " wants us to be like good Jews and just go quietly to the gas chambers . " At that point , his daughter Natasha , who had been with her sister Michelle at the trial , clapped her hands twice , and a kicking , punching melee ensued between two U.S. marshals and the defendants , their friends and relatives . <P> Incredible Statement . Chief Defense Attorney William Kunstler , reduced to tears of resentment and frustration , pleaded with the judge : " Take me next . Let me be next . " Kunstler got four years and 13 days for contempt ; his associate , Leonard Weinglass , was sentenced to 20 months and five days . Hoffman told them : " Crime , if it is on the rise , is due in large part to the fact that waiting in the wings are lawyers who are willing to go beyond professional responsibility , professional rights , professional duties , in their defense of a criminal . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American judicial tradition dictates that , no matter what the crime , a defendant is entitled to full , vigorous representation .
