txt As part of his effort to cut $200 million from New York State 's $3.4 billion welfare and Medicaid bill , Governor Carey will seek to end Medicaid reimbursement . for services such as private-duty nursing and physical therapy and to require Medicaid recipients to pay part of the cost of dental care , eyeglasses and prescription drugs . The Governor is also considering a cut in the maximum allowable rent paid by welfare recipients , his Social Services Commissioner , Philip L. Toia , said yesterday . In the year since the state imposed county-by-county ' rent ceilings for welfare recipients , Mr. Toia said , the ceilings have in effect ' become the floors , with landlords automatically charging the top rent to welfare tenants while charging tenants who are not on welfare , perhaps $50 a month less for identical apartments . One Proposal Defeated These options are part of a budget-cutting package on which Mr. Toia has spent the week briefing public officials , social service agencies and other /interested groups . The Carey administration 's effort , he said in an interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts on those who can best afford them while avoiding the relatively more drastic step of cutting the basic grants to families with dependent children . Last year , the Governor proposed the elimination of Medicaid reimbursement for such practitioners as chiropractors and podiatrists . But the Legislature re- stored the cuts after intensive lobbying by community groups and by the practitioners themselves . Mr. Carey Is now trying to avoid another reversal in the budget he will send to the Legislature on Jan. 18 by briefing the legislative leaders in advance and by going beyond the Legislature to create public awareness of the problem and the available options . The Governor said last week that his new budget would have to close a SI billion gap between revenues and expenditures . In the interview , Mr. Toia produced a chart showtng the 17 optional Medicaid services , ranging from the provision of artificial limbs to nursing-home care , which a state may elect to offer beyond the basic medical services it is required by Federal law to provide . What Carey Would Cut Of the 50 states , three territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Minnesota offer all 17 optional services . The Governor will propose the elimination of six : chiropractors , podiatrists , optometrists , private duty nurses , physical therapists , and a category called " diagnostic , screening , preventive , and rehabilitative services . " He will propose that recipients of four other optional services ? prescription drugs , dentistry , prostheses , and eyeglasses  --  be required to pay part of the cost , as provided for in Federal regulations . Despite the breadth of these changes , the total state savings would be only between $6 million and $8 million a year , a small fraction of the $200 million goal that Mr. Toia said illustrates how difficult it is to effect sizable savings while protecting the programs that are most important to the people . For the rest of the saving , Mr. Toia is looking at the range of the department 's programs . Tentative decisions so far include the following : CTo keep state spending for social services such as day care , foster care , family planning , and counseling within Ithe Federal guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now share , on a 50-50 basis , the $58 million by which these services now exceed Fedleral cost ceilings . cTo cut by as much as 10 percent the monthly grant that goes to single persons and childless couples on home relief . Mr. Toia said that more than half of new home relief recipients were under 30 years of age  --  as compared with 25 percent of new recipients just a year ago ? and that these young people were the most mobile and employable of all welfare recipients . Since the cut has not been determined , he did not put a dollar figure on the saving . ( ITo increase efforts to combat fraud and ineligibility , which Mr. Toia said could save $20 million . CT ? implement a range of measures Mr. Toia placed under the heading of " utilization control , " including the closing of 5,000 extra hospital beds , controls on nursing home admissions , a ban on elective hospital admissions on Fridays and Saturdays , and the requirement that a number of simple surgical procedures be performed on an outpatient basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , under present regulations if a home relief recipient refuses to take a job that is offered to him , he can be taken off the home-relief rolls . But if he requests a hearing , he must continue to receive his grant during the months it takes to finish the hearing . Under the new regulations , the grant would stop immediately , to be paid retroactively if the hearing ends in favor of the recipient . A Potential Target A major area of potential , but so far unrealized economies , is Medicaid reimbursement rates to hospitals and nursing homes . Last year , the state tried to put a retroactive freeze on these rates . Both types of institutions sued and the state has been in court ever since . The reaction to Mr. Toia 's proposals so far has been predictable  --  delight from county executives , who would save money from the dropping of covered services , and dismay from the agencies that receive state reimbursement . One Democratic aide in the Legislature foresaw what could be one of the most bitter fights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a health problem , it 's a labor problem , " and predicted that city legislators would be reluctant to support any program that would lead to the dismissal of thousands of hospital workers . Mr. Toia said that he viewed a complicated package of small , unpopular cuts as the only possible counterweight to Republican proposals for a flat 10 percent cut in all welfare grants and that if the . maller cuts were thwarted then the more sweeping cut would be inevitable . " We 've got to start turning welfare around now if we do n't want to blow everything , " he said .
