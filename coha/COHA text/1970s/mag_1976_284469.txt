THE STRONG BROWN GOO : THE STORY OF THE NIGER RIVER <P> by SANCHE DE GRAMONT 350 pages . Houghton Mifflin. $12.50 . <P> <P> This is history to make the gods weep , perhaps with laughter . Three incompatible cultures met late in the 18th century , when English explorers began to poke into the great fever swamp of western Africa that is now Nigeria . Arab traders had arrived 300 years earlier , recommending their religion and bringing news that a minor local industry , slave raiding , could be the basis of a thriving export trade . The Britons advocated their own faith . They also urged the unwelcome view that slavery was immoral . It interfered with the manpower needed for the palm-oil trade . <P> In a series of adventures that might have sprung from the imagination of Evelyn Waugh , Englishmen were sold leaky dugouts , assisted with false geographical information and detained as house pets by bemused native kings . Malaria felled the adventurers in wholesale lots . The curative properties of quinine had been known for two centuries , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus was thought unfit for Protestants . At least one explorer , Richard Lander , was forced to drink poison . This ritual proved his good faith when he survived it , and he was permitted to watch human sacrifices . " The head is severed from the trunk with an ax , " he wrote blandly , " and the smoking blood gurgles into a calabash ... " <P> Baffling Travelers . A chronicle in which explorer after explorer vanishes into the jungle necessarily lacks the grand narrative sweep of Alan Moorehead 's The White Nile and The Blue Nile .

At the outset , as was true of the Nile , no European knew the source of the Niger ( in the mountains about 200 miles east of Sierra Leone ) . Its destination was also unknown . There were even disputes about the direction in which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way across the Sahara to the Nile . <P> Only after four decades of exploration did the world learn that the Niger flowed northeast , then took a mighty turn at Timbuctoo and continued south into the Gulf of Guinea at the slave-trading settlement called Brass . <P> Geographical mysteries were thus solved , but the region 's weakened and debased societies and its fever-ridden travelers remained baffling to each other . In 1854 a German Lutheran explorer named Heinrich Earth was detained in Timbuctoo for eight months before rival political factions agreed to release him . An Arab officer in favor of Earth 's execution spoke disapprovingly of Christians : " They sit like women in the bottom of their steamboats and do nothing but eat raw eggs . "
