The flames and accompanying thick , black smoke , began raging through the 20th-floor offices of Sol Hurok Enterprises at 9:30 A.M. , minutes after an incendiary bomb exploded at another talent-booking office , Columbia Artists , a few blocks away at 165 West 57th Street . There were no injuries at Columbia Artists because the employes had not yet reported for work . Death Caused by Smoke Police Commissioner Patrick V.

As of mid-December , 1971 , 40 bombs had been placed . The anonymous callers said the fires had been set to protest " the deaths and imprisonment of Soviet Jews . " They shouted the slogan of the militant Jewish Defense League : " Never again ! " A spokesman for the league , which has demonstrated and organized incidents to press the Soviet Union into letting Soviet Jews migrate to Israel , deplored the fire-bombings and denied that the group had any connection with them . However , Commissioner Murphy , at a news conference , said that even if the J.D.L. had no part in the incident , it " must accept the responsibility when violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrations and statements . Fire officials at the scene said that the smoke and layout of the high-rise building had combined to create a " mousetrap " for employees on the 20th floor . Many in offices on the opposite side of the flame-filled reception hall , including 83-year-old Mr. Hurok , were unable to escape to elevators and stairwells . Mr. Hurok , who is generally regarded as the father of cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and the United States , was treated at Polyclinic Hospital for smoke inhalation and released in his doctor 's care . Injured Identified Miss Hones was found alongside two other women employes of Hurok in a closed room 100 feet from the fire , all apparently overcome by smoke .

Four other persons were treated at the scene .

In the fire at Columbia Artists , witnesses said two young men , " clean-cut and white , entered the ground-floor offices on 57th Street shortly after 9 KM , and went into the reception room . Leon Pearson , a building maintenance man , said the men left a few minutes later , saying they would be back . " A few minutes later I heard a ' woosh , ' and everything was bright , " the maintenance man said . Only 20 of Columbia 's 120 employes were in the building at the time , because office hours start at 9:30 A.M. Most of those on hand were able to run out some back steps . As smoke filled the fivestory building , Tom Graham , a manager on the fifth floor , jumped to the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 minutes until firemen could pluck him from there . Nathan Shaw , vice president and controller of the company said that someone had thrown ammonia stink bombs into the building a couple of years ago when Columbia brought the Omsk Siberian Dancers to the United States . From facts supplied by dozens of witnesses at the Hurok fire , including some who escaped the flames on the 20th floor , the following account emerged : Mr. Hurok arrived In his chaffeured car shortly before 9:30 A.M. , as he always does when he is in New York City . About 10 other employes were already in the offices , along with several building workmen who were finishing the reception area . Kelly Brown , a college student working temporarily for the Hurok organization , looked up from the switchboard in the reception hall and saw a puff of smoke come from near an electric outlet on a nearby wall . He told fire officials that the smoke seemed to run up the wire of a lamp connected in the outlet and that then the light bulb in the lamp seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Bolton , a Hurok service supervisor , said he was watching the building workmen when " suddenly the chairs near the switchboard went on fire . " " They shouted for fire extinguishers , but it did n't do any good , " Mr. Bolton told a reporter . " The chairs were a furnace , so I put my coat over my head , ran through the flames and down the 20 floors . " Peter Gelb , 18 , who is working for Mr. Hurok prior to entering Columbia University in the fall , was late for work and as the elevator he was riding stopped at the 20th floor , he remarked to two other employes that it was 9:35 A.M. " The doors opened and a wall of flame leaped into the car , and I heard someone yell , " Get a fire extinguisher , " Mr. Gelb recounted . " All I saw was bright fire and smoke is the elevator continued to the 22d floor .

John Gingrich , Hurok pub-1 licity associate , filled a waste basket with water and tossed that at the flames . When that did n't work , he tried to call the Fire Department but discovered all the lines in the office had been knocked out by the fire near the switchboard , Employes Smash Windows David Rosen , a young lawyer in the firm of Stein &; Rosen on the 31st and 32d floors , saw the smoke coming up through the building and tried to use the fire stairs . " The stairs were useless , full of smoke , " he reported . Instead , he got on an elevator and stopped on the 20th floor . Mr. Gingrich stumbled onto the elevator , and both men held the car there for others to get Ion , But no one else came , and the two men rode down to call the Fire Department .

Many smashed heavy office objects hrough the dark-tinted windows ? an act that the police and firemen said later probably saved their lives . They shouted out windows for help . And as the smoke filled the floors above them , the smashing of windows was repeated again and again . But some did not think to break the windows . " We were scared stiff , " said Miss Armstrong , a Hurok secretary who was found uncoilcious with the dead woman , Miss Hones . " Smoke was coming in the ventilators , " she continued . " We put ourselves down on the floor and covered our faces . I burst into tears . Virginia Proodian , an accounting employed said , ' It 's all right ; somebody will come for us ' Iris Miss Hones was real frightened . I ca n't remember what she said , but she was absolutely still after awhile . " Miss Armstrong said that Miss Proodian had attempted to break a window but that the attempt had ' failed .
