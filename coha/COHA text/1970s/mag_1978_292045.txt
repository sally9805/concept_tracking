And Carter , Congress and country prepare for the worst <P> After three months of strike , after two detailed contracts had been negotiated , after the White House had intervened and called on both the industry and the union to settle their differences for the national good , the critical decision last week lay in the rough and sturdy hands of the 165,000 United Mine Workers . In scores of begrimed towns throughout Appalachia , in settings as varied as Utah , Missouri and Pennsylvania , they marched to their union headquarters to cast their ballots-or , in some instances , angrily shred and burn their copies of the pact . And though the final results would not be in until this week , from the very first tallies the tide ran heavily against acceptance of the contract . <P> The outcome of the vote was crucial for the nation and for the President , who had committed his prestige by trying to force a settlement . Officially , White House policy last week was one of hands off . " We will not be encouraging ratification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall. * " The choice is theirs . " Nevertheless , the White House increased the pressure for an agreement by preparing to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act . In the past the miners defied Taft-Hartley , and their acquiescence now is uncertain . But the President selected a board of inquiry to determine if a national emergency existed . Affidavits were drawn up certifying that the strike posed a threat to national health and safety , and plans were reviewed to go to federal court , should the vote be no , to seek an injunction for an 80-day cooling-off period . Additional injunctions would be sought against as many as a dozen particularly troublesome locals to make sure that their members returned to work . Marshall also warned that food stamps would be cut off for miners who continued to stay out . <P> <P> In addition to preparing for Taft-Hartley , the White House sounded out Congress on the prospects for legislation enabling the U.S. Government to take over the mines . Marshall held long talks with members of Congress from coal areas : Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins of Kentucky . Support for seizure of the mines seemed shaky . It would be unpalatable to the operators , who had already given way under presidential pressure on the new contract , and might lose still more if the Government ran the mines . While the profits would still go to the owners , wages and work rules would be set by the Government . The takeover , however , would have the grudging approval of the miners , who figure they could get a better contract from the White House than from the operators .
