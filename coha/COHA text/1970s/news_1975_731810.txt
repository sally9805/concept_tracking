txt AN ESTATE battle rife with courtroom theatrics and sordid tales of gambling and prostitution in the Wild West is coming to an end after 11 years . The signature of Judge Robert J. Dunne , head of Cook County Circuit Court 's Probate Division , probably within a month , is expected to settle the estate , awarding thousands of dollars to an elderly Detroit man and his sister . Both are cousins of Lawrence Wakefield , who operated Chicago 's most successful policy wheel , outwitting the crime syndicate and police alike for more than three decades . BY SOME LAWYERS ' figures , an estimated $350,000 will be divided among the heirs  --  James Gamby and Elsie Gamby Bell  --  the lawyers , and James O'Keefe , court appointed administrator of the Wakefield estate . Eleven years ago this week , four policemen raided Wakefield 's modest home at 9312 S. Rhodes Av. and found $943,000 ? $764,000 in small bills , the rest in bondli . They also Tound 11 presses for printing policy slips . Of that , $431,000 , plus some money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given to Mrs. Rose Kennedy , an ex-madam who lived with Wakefield for more than 30 years . Mrs. Kennedy , born as Rachel Rubin in Philadelphia is 1093 , argued that the money police found belonged to her , not Wakefield . She testified that she earned it from the brothels she operated from 1913 to 1928 in Calgary , Alta . THAI ' CLAIM provoked laughter from lawyers and . judges looking on this grandmotherly figure in a cotton dress and a fur coat , both well worn . In fact , attorney Norman Jack Barry made her take a Be detector test before agreeing to represent her . But Mrs. Kennedy 's tale was corroborated by no fewer than 100 men who 40 years later swore in depositions that they paid handsome sums to spend some time with one of her girls . Then included an ex-mayor of Toronto who admitted to paying $10,000 for a single night . She ran the brothel while Frank Kennedy , her partner and later her husband , operated a gambling hall . In the 1920s , many American cattle herds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Calgary was the slaughter town where cowboys sold their cattle ' for top cash prices and then set out to raise some hell . The Kennedys were selling what the cowboys were buying . T 11E KENNEDYS AMASSED 5750,500 by 1925 , and the cash was stuffed into a black tootlocker which the couple carried to their new residence on Chicago 's South Side . Kennedy dared not challenge organized crime 's hold on most kinds of gambling here and began operating a policy wheel . He ' opened it in the old Brookmont Hotel at 3953 S. Michigan Av. and hired a $35-a-week numbers runner  --  Lawrence Wakefield . It was estimated that the policy wheel was pulling in as much as $300,000 a year when Kennedy died in 1933 . Wakefield moved into Kennedy 's home and look over the policy wheel . He hired only five policy writers and operated in the vicinity of - 13a and State Streets . He outfitted himself in clothes more befitting a laborer than gambling boss and never drove expensive cars . MS TAX RETURNS were meticulously pre-oared with as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense " leaving a taxable income of less than ' 20.000 , He was never audited by the Internal ! : e venue Service . His low profile paid off in other ways , too . ! le survived the takeover , of black-controlled , ice by syndicate mobsters and escaped arrest by the police until 1949 . But it was n't all an act , Wakefield and Mrs. Kennedy were extremely frugal . As it ? turned out , that may have cost Mrs. Kennedy a lot of money W en Witkof eld suffered a heart attack on Feb. 18 , 1964 , she called the fire department . Had Mrs. Kennedy been willing to part with if mere . pittance of her cash hoard and call a private ambulance the chances are good she could have had the entire fortune to herself . But a policeman who was assisting the firemen noticed policy slips and money wrappers , notified his commander , and before evening the home was staked out by police . AN HOUR AFTER Wakefield died In Presbyterian-St Luke 's Hospital the next day , policemen were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy testified late ! . " they threatened to shoot my dogs if I did n't lel them in . " Behind a lucked bedroom door , the astounded policemen found the cash and bonds stuffed illaide clothes , dresser drawers and that old black trunk . Some of the bills were 50 years old . The money was tossed into a sheet and carried elf to a police station where for the next III hours it was ' counted under hot television lights and the watchful eyes of Rose Kennedy . " Where did you get all that money ? " someone asked . " Selling peanuts in the Loop , " she quipped . TILE CASII WAS impounded and over the next 11 years no fewer than 24 people  --  twice the number of Wakefields listed in the 1964 phone directory  --  came forward and claimed to be heirs . The most bizarre petition , the lawyers agreed , came from a woman claiming to be Wakefield 's only daughter , Connie Stineberg Wakefield . She is , in fact , really Martha Louise White and now goes under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified as Chicago 's welfare queen , accused of collecting public aid under dozens of aliases in more than a dozen states . She demanded all of the money and produced two wills which Wakefield was supposed to have left with her dnd which gave her all of his money . Even a physician testified that he assisted at her birth in the Wakefield home on Christmas ' Day , 1934 . THE RUSE WAS toppled when an attorney led into the courtroom her 84-year-old grand-Mother whom - he had located in the hills of Tennessee . The woman wore hiking boots and pointed with pride when she spotted her granddaughter , Martha Louise , causing the latter to faint . Miss White 's petition was tossed out and Mrs. Kennedy agreed to abandon her claim for all of the money and settle for the $431,000 , thus avoiding what may have been another lengthy court battle . Federal courts ruled the cash was tax free since she earned it outside the country . Gerald J. Mannix , an attorney who formerly worked in the state 's attorney 's office and followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of $60,000 to the county treasury because the estate included contraband money . But a score of others claiming to be ' heirs fought over the rest of the money . To settle the dispale the court hired Sam Fink , a professioal genealogist , to trace the Wakefield family , Fink 's research took him East and into Canada over several years before he completed the Wakefield family tree . He confirmed that the Gambys were the sole heirs . FINK LEARNED that the Wakefield name came from a Kentucky river where his grandfather was born . The grandfather 's mother was the runaway daughter of a prominent founder of an ' East Coast chemical company and his father a slave . Wakefield 's own father was schooled and ? honored as a successful inventor in Pittsburgh . But no heirs could be located on the father 's side and only the Gambys survived on his mother 's . A recent Appellate Court decision struck down the petition of a Detroit woman claiming to be Wakefield 's one-time common law wife . The ruling removed the last roadblock In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clients , the Gambys , Left yet unanswered is the amount that the Gambys will receive . A large chunk of it will be used in legal fees spent to defend the estate against so many petitioners . Still , Owens said their share " would be significant . "
