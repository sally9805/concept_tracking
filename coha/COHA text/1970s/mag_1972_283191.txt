For the past two years , Alexander Solzhenitsyn , Russia 's greatest living writer , has been prevented from delivering the lecture that Nobel prizewinners customarily give . In 1970 , when he won the award , Soviet officials forbade him to travel to Sweden for the solemn ceremony . Gunnar Jarring , Sweden 's ambassador to Moscow , refused to transmit Solzhenitsyn 's manuscript to Stockholm by diplomatic pouch . Last week the long-awaited lecture finally appeared in the yearbook of the Nobel Foundation , which did not disclose how it had been obtained . <P> The lecture was supremely worth waiting for . The persecuted author , who has spent eleven years in Stalinist prisons and in exile , mourns his fellow Russian writers who died in concentration camps . Solzhenitsyn writes : " In order to mount this platform from which the Nobel lecture is read ... I have climbed not three or four makeshift steps but hundreds and even thousands of them-steep , unyielding , frozen steps leading out of the darkness and cold where it was my fate to survive , while others-perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I stand here today , accompanied by the shadows of the fallen , head bowed , allowing others to pass ahead of me to this place-as I stand here , how am I to divine what they would have wished to say ? " Quoting from the Russian philosopher Vladimir Soloviev , Solzhenitsyn thus defines his obligation to bear witness for the dead : " Even in chains we must complete that circle which the gods have inscribed for us . " <P> He continues : " Literature is the living memory of a nation . It preserves and kindles within itself the flame of a country 's spent history , in a form that is safe from distortion and slander . In this way , literature , together with language , protects the soul of a nation . But woe to that nation whose literature is disturbed by the intervention of power . Because that is not just a violation of ' freedom to publish ' ; it is the stopping of the heart of a nation , a laceration of its memory . " When writers , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they die , never hearing the echo of their written words , then that is not only their personal tragedy , but a sorrow to the whole nation , a danger to the whole nation ... and sometimes a danger to the whole of mankind . " <P> Solzhenitsyn castigates the West as well as the Soviet Union for the untrammeled violence that he sees " brazenly and victoriously striding across the whole world . " He cites the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia , " when tanks flooded the streets of a foreign capital with blood " and " hijackings , kidnappings , explosions and conflagrations " in the West as actions by the forces of evil " that are determined to convulse and destroy civilization . " He warns : " And they may well succeed . "
