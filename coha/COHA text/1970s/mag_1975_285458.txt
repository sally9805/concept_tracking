MEMORY OF US <P> Directed by H. KAYE DYAL Screenplay by ELLEN GEER <P> Betty and Brad have a comfortable suburban home , two kids , a housekeeper , bullfight posters on the wall and multivolumes of Will and Ariel Durant on the bookshelves . They are not happy , a condition that has only fleetingly to do with children or interior decoration . Brad plays around ; Betty plays alone . <P> " Here 's a secret , " she confides at the beginning of Memory of Us , assuming - probably incorrectly-that anyone wants to hear . It seems that she is happiest in a tacky little room she rents in the Starlite Motel , where she can practice photography , be by herself a few hours a day to " work things out , " or just " drift . " All of us , sad to say , drift with her , back to the early days of her marriage , when she would thread a string from the bedroom to the front door of their little apartment and affix a note for Brad : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string to an extra-special screw . " Other recollections include birth ( " Funny , " Betty ruminates , " how you forget the actual pain and power of birth - maybe so you 'll try again " ) , the confession of Brad 's first infidelity ( " I forgive you , " Betty responds promptly ) , and daily rounds like picking the kids up at school ( " You know , " Betty confesses to the family mutt , " we 've got a lot in common-we 're both retrievers " ) . <P> One day Brad ( Jon Cypher ) tracks Betty to her motel room and concludes that she is either having an affair or a breakdown . Unequipped to deal with either possibility , he has one stopgap measure : he wants to join up with a clan of swingers and swappers . Betty , usually a glutton for punishment , draws the line . The last scene shows her taking one of the two family cars and heading for an uncertain dawn . That she picks the station wagon with the fake wood paneling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the future . <P> Memory of Us is unsparingly earnest , a quality that may excuse its foolishness without diminishing it . The movie also presents a fairly melancholy prospect with its heartfelt but trite treatise written by a woman , Ellen Geer , who also plays the lead . It is long past time now for movies made by and about women , but no one could have expected or wanted Memory of Us , which has less in common with heightened consciousness than with daytime soap opera . The movie is so thin and weepy that it inadvertently contradicts its intention and turns into what it was trying to avoid , a stereotypical example of what has been known so condescendingly , for so long , as a " woman 's picture .
