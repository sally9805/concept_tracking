Kentucky Derby officials would not be surprised if the Lone Ranger rode up this week to get Silver a special dispensation to race the three-year-olds in Saturday 's Run for the Roses . Everyone else with a horse seems to want a slot in the starting gate this year . At last count there were about 35 horses headed for Churchill Downs-far more than the track can or cares to accommodate , particularly for the 100th running of the race . <P> The stampede to Louisville started because no clear favorite for the Derby turned up on the winter racing circuit . Of 32 pre-Derby tests for three-year-olds run by late April , 27 were won by different horses . Hence many owners are willing to put up the necessary $7,600 in Derby entry and starting fees in the hope of getting lucky . <P> Official Shivers . Protagonist , last year 's two-year-old champion and early Derby favorite , had not won a race since November going into last Saturday 's Stepping Stone Purse at Churchill Downs . Agitate took the California Derby two weeks ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anita Derby several weeks earlier . When there seemed to be a chance to narrow down the Derby field in the Wood Memorial in New York in mid-April , that race had to be split into two sections to handle the overflow of entrants . One winner , Rube the Great , is considered a strong Derby contender , but the other , Flip Sal , is largely untested . The only horse to show solid promise thus far is Judger , winner of the Florida Derby and the Blue Grass Stakes with come-from-behind spurts down the homestretch . <P> After 99 years of single blessedness , the prospect of running two sections at tradition-steeped Churchill Downs gives race officials the shivers . To avoid a double Derby , officials are ready to try everything from friendly persuasion with trainers and owners to imposing severe veterinarian inspections that would bar all but the soundest horses . That and other measures were under consideration last week in order to hold the field to 26 , the maximum the track can handle . <P> But even if the race is limited to 26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucien Laurin , trainer of the last two Derby winners , Secretariat and Riva Ridge , says that 26 horses bolting from the gate would be " a cavalry charge , " with so much bumping and jostling that many horses would be knocked off stride before reaching the first turn . Laurin himself has decided not to enter Secretariat 's half brother Capital Asset , an embarrassing relative which finished last in the Wood . Meanwhile , everyone else 's horse van keeps arriving in Louisville.
