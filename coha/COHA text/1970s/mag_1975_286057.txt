A major event in the history of opera in America has been taking place in Seattle over the past two weeks . The Seattle Opera Company presented the four operas of Wagner 's Der Ring der Nibelungen in German within a week . That is the way the Ring is regularly performed at the Wagner Festspielhaus in Bayreuth , but almost never in the U.S. Then the Seattle company spun around and repeated the cycle in English . That bilingual trick is a feat that no other company in the world has equaled . <P> Wagner knew exactly what he was doing at Bayreuth . Heard in quick succession , Das Rheingold , Die Walkure and Siegfried have a staggering cumulative effect . By the tune one settles in for the 4-hour finale , Die Gtterdmmerung , the ear reverberates with leitmotivs ; and Wagner 's gods , earthlings , dwarfs and dragons seem familiar , necessary , among the mind 's permanent emotional reference points . One gasps at the death of Siegfried , even if he is the sort who will take a drink from anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of us . <P> New Trend . The Seattle Ring has a predominantly young cast , with just enough veterans to glue things together . Among them is the stage director , George London , 55 , one of the great Wagnerian bass-baritones of the 1950s and ' 60s . If London has his way , he may start a whole new realistic trend in staging the Ring . After the innovative Wieland Wagner began presenting his grandfather 's works as absorbing formal abstractions at Bayreuth in the early 1950s , the imitators began falling into line . Says London : " Soon everyone was in a culdesac , with no place to go . That is when the gimmicks started popping up . In one Ring in Germany , for example , the Valkyries came in on motorcycles . In France , Wotan wore a top hat and tails . Enough . It 's poisonous . We have to go back to the source now . " <P> In London 's Ring a sword is a sword , a spear is a spear , and Fafner the dragon is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monster that requires eight stagehands to operate . London 's conception is not perfect : he may not put the Valkyries on wheels , but having them cavort like chorus girls is not an improvement . There is no bear for Siegfried to tug , alas , nor does Brnnhilde ride a horse into the pyre . But she does sleep on a genuine jagged peak-not just some symbolic platform . Reversing another current fashion , London puts light rather than gloom on everything , and the operagoer does not have to view the whole show through a front scrim . <P> In the German version of the Ring especially , one could see and hear London 's influence on the singers ' diction , gestures and all-round Wagnerian style . Where his touch left off , Conductor Henry Holt 's picked up . The Vienna-born , Los Angeles-reared Holt , 41 , has been the Seattle Opera 's music director for nine years . His Wagner may lack Sir Georg Solti 's dynamism . But it has warmth , coherence and authority .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
