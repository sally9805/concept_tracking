The Second Pillar of Ignorance by Peter Lubin When President Carter raised high his glass in Tehran on New Year 's Day 1978 to toast the shah and the Peacock Throne as an " island of stability " in a turbulent region he was not being unusually naive . He was simply expressing what most Americans , fed a steady diet of misinformation , believed at the time . We know now , as we did not know then , that the real Iran is not the Iran of the shah , and the shahbanou , and Peter Lubin is a Boston lawyer . all their glittering retinue . The real Iran is much more truly represented by the enraged imam in Qom and the mobs in Tehran . But the repeated mistakes and miscalculations of our government force us to ask what we really know about the stability of other regimes in the Middle East , especially the most important one , Saudi Arabia . After Iran , how can we make certain , or at least more likely , that there will be no similar surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the states of the Persian Gulf is John Barrett Kelly . In a recent article , " Of Valuable Oil and Worthless Policies " ( Encounter , June 1979 ) Kelly observed that Western policy in the Gulf region " was initially fashioned from illusion and has been sustained ever since by deceit . " After the British withdrew from east of Suez , the United States did not fill the vacuum of power created by their withdrawal . Instead , American policymakers jerrybuilt a " twin-pillar " policy which consisted of building up Saudi Arabia and Iran as " guardians of the Gulf . " " I-he State Department conducted a tireless campaign to depict Saudi Arabia and Iran as dependable allies of the United States : dynamic , stable , forward-looking , economically progressive , and militarily strong , or at least potentially so , " Kelly wrote . That policy is now a shambles . One " pillar " is gone , the other is shaky . There is no margin for error left . The economies of the West would collapse if the oil from Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the Soviet Union , or of Soviet-backed surrogates , or simply of local fanatics who might cut or shut production . If we are to construct sensible policies we need , before all else , reliable information about Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states . But we are prevented from obtaining such information for a variety of reasons : the ignorance and gullibility of the press ; the unreliability of the " experts " we consult ; the efficiency of an army of publicists working on behalf of the Saudis ; and finally , the difficulties faced within Saudi Arabia by those Americans whose job it is to gather intelligence . If Saudi Arabia were only as important to us as , say , Albania , our lack of information would not be so worrisome . Or if it were an open society , like England or Canada , we would be less concerned . But it is not so unimportant , and it is a closed society , one that attempts mightily to present its own version of events to the outside world . A good example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mecca . The daily reports were constantly changing and contradictory . The self-proclaimed Mandi was an " American-trained " student , we were confidently told on the MacNeil-Lehrer program by someone who claimed to have been told it by a close friend in the Saudi royal family . Other reports said he was a law student , or a theology student , but with no American training . His name was variously given as Mohammed Ben Abdullah , Mohammed Abdullah al-Quraisha , and Mohammed Abdullah al-Kahtani . Some reports first described the armed attackers as Shi'ite Iranians . Others said they were Shi'ites from eastern Saudi Arabia . ( One US government official blithely declared early on that " there are no Shi'ites in Saudi Arabia . " On December 6 the New York Times reported that there are 300,000 Saudi Shi'ites . ) Still other reports said the attackers were Sunni Moslems from western Saudi Arabia , members of the Qoraish tribe . Later we heard that they were members of the Oteiba tribe . Still later we heard that they were a mix of Saudis , Egyptians , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Salafiya movement . We learned that the group was a ragtag band of a few dozen fanatics , then that it was a larger group of tribal rivals of the House of Saud , then that it was a well-armed , well-trained group of several hundred men , and most recently ? through non-Saudi sources in Paris ? that a thousand men may have been involved in the takeover . The assault on the Grand Mosque took place at dawn on Tuesday , November 20 . On Wednesday thousands of " crack " Saudi troops were said to have retaken the mosque , and were in the process of mopping up . It would all be over within a few hours . On Thursday it was over . On Friday it was all over . On Saturday those Saudi troops were in complete possession of the mosque . On Sunday they were mopping up , and in a matter of hours it would all be over . On Monday it was almost all over , except for the mopping up . On Tuesday , a full week after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last-ditch holdouts in the basement ) . On Wednesday , November 28 , only some mopping up remained . On Thursday , November 29 , it was nearing the end . And on Saturday , December 1 , a few holdouts were reported . They were being flushed and smoked out by the Saudi authorities , who were burning tires and deliberately flooding the mosque 's basement passages . Five days later it was all over but the final mopping up . Eventually that too will be completed , and the " crack " troops ? to whom we are entrusting our F-15s ? will have issued their invitation to the beheadings . In the meantime , the press continues to romanticize and glamorize Saudi Arabia in Sunday supplements and high fashion magazines . For an extreme case , see the 15-page spread in the October issue of Town and Country , in which members of the Saudi gentry are seen discharging the responsibilities of rule , or relaxing in their stately homes . Society columnists will continue to fill newspaper columns with descriptions of elaborate Saudi Embassy parties , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have studied and surfed in the California sun . But parties and diplomas and lengthy stays abroad prove nothing . Ibrahim Yazdi , Khomeini 's close associate and until recently his foreign minister , spent 17 years in Houston , where he raised a family , and even became an American citizen . Abolhassan Bani-Sadr , whose thin smile replaced Mr. Yazdi 's wide grin , spent a similar period in Paris , and co-authored a book , Oil and Violence , with a French professor . Sadegh Ghotbzadeh , who is now having his turn as Iranian foreign minister , has an almost identical history . All three men are determinedly anti-American and anti-Western . One might also note that the present prime minister of Afghanistan and his predecessor ? two Soviet marionettes ? were employed by the Americans in Kabul , one as a translator at the American Embassy , before they took power . A shallow press is only one problem . There is also danger in our continued reliance on a handful of so-called experts , who proffer their " expertise " freely . Many are involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states . Others are in academic life , and dependent on Arab subventions for " Arab Centers " and professorial chairs , as well as on Arab goodwill for necessities of research such as visas . Few appear to worry nearly as much about the threat to our oil supply posed by the Soviets , Soviet surrogates , Moslem extremists , or OPEC extortion as they do about the " Palestinian problem , " which , whatever else it may be , is a handy diversionary tactic used by Arab oil states . Setting up a PLO state , some of these " experts " broadly hint , should do wonders for the security of the Gulf , as friends in Kuwait or Qatar have assured them . For example , Michael C. Hudson , director of the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies at Georgetown , reporting in the New York Times of November 1 about his recent trip to Bahrain , said he was convinced by " friendly Arab leaders in the area " that " the road to Gulf security leads through Palestine . " The work of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Atlantic Council on the Middle East , a report which predictably came down soft on the PLO , and was brimming with gratitude toward the Saudis . Many of those whose names were attached to the report are former ambassadors and lesser diplomatic personnel to Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and other Arab countries . Among the remainder are oil industry economists , public relations men , investment bankers , arms middlemen , and certain Georgetown academics . Several of the listed authors give their occupations as " consultant . " They neglect to add that their clients are major construction firms with projects in Saudi Arabia , public relations firms with Arab customers , arms sellers to the Arab military , and a variety of other organizations that have been compromised either by their business deals or by receipt of Arab financial support . Yet the report was discussed respectfully on the front page of the New York Times as the handiwork of a number of " prominent Americans " and presumably , therefore , people whom we ought to trust . Reliable experts do exist . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Europe who have studied the subject thoroughly and whose warnings should be heeded . I already have mentioned J. B. Kelly . Another knowledgeable observer who has been following events in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf for years is Arnold Hottinger , the senior Mideast correspondent for Neue ZUrcher Zeitung . In a chilling essay that appeared a few months ago , " Does Saudi Arabia Face Revolution ? " Hottinger noted , almost offhandedly , that the " regular Saudi army has been ripe for revolution for some time , " that " members of the Saudi upper crust . . . regard the kingdom primarily as a kind of money factory " and have no loyalty to it , and that the " monetary greed of the country 's leading businessmen and middlemen ? names like Khashoggi and Pharaon are among the most prominent ? has become almost pathologically insatiable . " Besides journalists and " experts , " we quite naturally rely primarily on the CIA and on our embassy in Riyadh for solid information about the current situation in Saudi Arabia . The Saudis have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , the chief of our CIA mission there was recalled at the insistence of Saudi Arabia . " Saudi displeasure focused on the CIA station chief , because he was known to have been making inquiries about the extent of dissension among the four brothers who dominate the ruling family , " the Los Angeles Times wrote on May 8 . As for the diplomatic corps , the problem is more subtle . A succession of ambassadors and other diplomatic personnel in Saudi Arabia have found employment after retirement in Saudi-related enterprises . One need not believe in conspiracies to question this state of affairs . It is not that diplomats are peculiarly susceptible to greed and conflict of interest . It is simply that any person of ordinary virtue might well find his or her judgment clouded because of the implied promise of a job in business or finance or foundation work or " consulting " that may await completion of his or her tenure . The practice of serving Arab governments after retirement has extended beyond the diplomatic corps to others we depend on in the making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jiddah , for example , became the main adviser to the Faisal Foundation . A recent chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee now works diligently on behalf of his clients , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , as a registered foreign agent . In its 1978 Annual Review of Human Rights , the State Department makes the Saudi system sound positively benign and commends Saudi society for its " egalitarian " nature . Such distortion harms us all . It is as essential that we truly comprehend the closed society of Saudi Arabia as it is that we comprehend the closed society of Soviet Russia . We can be certain that if the American ambassador in Moscow had arranged for a friend the job of representing the Soviets in a public relations effort in this country , the situation would not have been tolerated for a minute . And yet that is exactly what our current ambassador to Saudi Arabia , John C. West , did for his friend , public relations man Crawford Cook . West , a former governor of South Carolina who was immensely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Saudis that they retain Cook to help with their public relations campaign in this country . The Saudis took West 's advice and Cook was hired at an annual salary of several hundred thousand dollars . Precisely because people are not saints , we must avoid creating situations where sainthood becomes necessary . If officers of the armed services can no longer deal with certain defense-related matters for a number of years following their retirement , there should be a similar restriction against American diplomats becoming commercially involved with the very countries to which they were formerly accredited ( and thus trading on their office ? perhaps while they are still in it ) . The most guileless among us can understand the danger if our man in Riyadh were to begin to represent not America and American interests to the Saudis , but rather Saudi interests and demands to the Americans . Much nonsense has been written about the " moderate " role of Saudi Arabia in OPEC . It is true that seven to seven and a half million of the nine and a half million barrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Aramco at the stated OPEC price , fixed at last July 's meeting of OPEC at $18 per barrel , while other OPEC members are charging more . It is also true that the remaining two to two and a half million barrels a day is sold through other outlets at much higher prices . In fact , the Saudis still make much more money , tens of billions of dollars annually , than they would if there were a free market in oil , without the gigantic boost provided by the cartel . And it is Saudi Arabia that is the key to that cartel . Saudi Arabia , not Nigeria , not Venezuela , not even Qaddafi 's Libya , is keeping millions of barrels from the world market in order to keep prices up ( including those $45-$50 prices on the spot market that Sheikh Yamani ostentatiously deplores ) . The whole cartel depends for its success on the Saudi refusal to permit any production whatsoever from 22 of its 37 known oil-producing fields ( as reported by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in 1978 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more " moderate " than the other members of OPEC in its demand for a rise in the cartel price . It is in the Saudi interest , after all , to insure that prices rise no higher than would be consistent with continued high demand . In any case , there is every reason to think that OPEC production levels will be cut , and the price ceiling raised , at the next OPEC meeting , which begins in Caracas on December 17 . A variety of explanations will be offered ? all more acceptable than that of heedless greed . OPEC spokesmen will solemnly cite the " situation in Iran " or " too-rapid modernization " or increased concern about a " wasting asset . " We also deceive ourselves when we assume that Saudi Arabia is in America 's camp ( that " special relationship " ) and would do nothing to harm our interests , because Islam and communism are " incompatible . " Several Moslem rulers , even fanatically Moslem rulers , have had no trouble working hand-inglove with the Soviet Union . We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union first entered the Middle East through a massive arms deal with Egypt and Syria in 1955 . Saudi Arabia was motivated by anti-Hashemite fervor against the reigning monarchs in Jordan and Iraq . The Saudis support Somalia against the Soviet-backed Marxists in Ethiopia . So they do , but they backed Somalia just as unswervingly when that country , a member of the Arab League , had its forces supplied , trained , and maintained by the Soviet Union . Nor have the Saudis felt any compunction about joining the Soviet Union in supporting the PLO , which has become a convenient instrument of Soviet policy in the region . Here is an example to illustrate the kinds of folly typically found in articles written about Saudi Arabia . In February the New York Times published two articles on Saudi Arabia by Mr. Bayly Winder of the Department of Near East Languages and Literatures at New York University . On two successive days , then , more than a million readers were presented with what many of them took to be the studied conclusions of an " expert " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Musing on the suggestion of one senator that Saudi Arabia might actually be a " detriment to peace " and that a " fundamental review " of our policy toward Saudi Arabia might be called for , Mr. Winder made clear how offensive he found this idea : Is it possible that in Saudi Arabia there are those who advocate a fundamental review of policy towards America , which is seen as immobile with respect to Communist thrusts , ungrateful for moderation on oil , inflating away Saudi assets , and unable to solve the " Palestine problem " justly ? This paragraph is a nice compendium of all the clich ? s that have kept us believing that the Saudi oil policy is " moderate " and that they are " doing us favors " in OPEC . Such stale formulae prevent us from understanding how much the Saudis need us for protection against the Soviets , extremist Moslems , political radicals , and dissident tribes . Mr. Winder assures us as well that the Saudi system is fundamentally sound , and that the situation in Iran is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengths lacking elsewhere , say in Iran . With a relatively homogeneous population of only five million to eight million , large external assets , an infrastructure at the end of the beginning , and an annual oil income of some $35 billion , the kingdom is prepared to meet the rising expectations of its people . But some of those " relatively homogeneous " Saudi Arabs were behind the recent assault in Mecca . And some of those Saudi Arabs are ancient rivals of the family that currently rules Saudi Arabia . One hardly knows what to say about the breathtakingly breezy approach to statistics ( " five to eight million " ? leaving three million as a margin for error ) except to note that the House of Saud has about 4000 members , which leaves , at a minimum , 4,996,000 other Arabs native to Saudi Arabia who may not wish the regime well , not to mention the several million foreign workers ( more than 40 percent of the population , according to recent published estimates ) who may have their own grievances . " Large external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he came tumbling down . And as Khomeini demonstrates , not all Moslems believe in the satisfaction of " rising expectations " and would prefer the destruction of a society that permits both those expectations and their satisfaction . Mr. Winder continues : In addition , the House of Saud , unlike that of the Shah , has deep roots and experience in governing . It has , in fact , ruled the heartland of Arabia since well before the establishment of the American Republic . More importantly , the Government has always identified itself as an Islamic polity , dedicated to the service of Islam 's holy places , its adherents , its ideals , its achievements , and its final authority in men 's affairs . The Saudis , who feel a deep identity with Islam , and who , unlike their neighbours in Egypt or Iran , have no competing ties to an earlier high civilization , know unambiguously that their government cherishes and promotes Islamic values . There is also a little-noted political strength . Any Saudi subject can still present his grievance directly to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A half hour in the almost daily rnajlis ( audience session ) of king or amir would convince doubters of the continuing effectiveness of this ancient institution . When Mr. Winder tells the readers of the New York Times ( for whom he has been identified as " Director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near East Studies at New York University " ) that the House of Saud has deep roots and experience in governing , he is disguising the fact that as a ruling national dynasty , rather than as a tribal clan holding sway over the interior desert , the House of Saud dates from the early 1920s , and is thus almost exactly as old as the Pahlavi dynasty . While Mr. Winder may believe that the Saudi government " unambiguously cherishes and promotes Islamic values , " apparently not everyone on the Arabian peninsula has been convinced , to judge by recent events . When he writes that the House of Saud has " no competing ties to an earlier high civilization , " he is saying that the very primitiveness of the Saudi ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those burdened by such cultural baggage . As for the soothing use of local color ( the age-old tradition of the amir holding forth at the majlis , which , far from being " little-noted , " is a staple of Saudipublicity ) , neither those who took over the mosque in Mecca , nor the 20,000 rioters reported in the oil-producing regions in early December , seem to have found the majlis to be the ideal outlet for expressing their discontents . Mr. Winder 's conclusion follows logically from all that he has said before : " These positive factors plus . the observable absence of dissidence lead one to conclude that in the short term there is little cause for alarm about internal threats to stability in Saudi Arabia . " The " observable absence of dissidence " noted by Mr. Winder may simply be the result of an absence of discerning observers . Current American policy toward Saudi Arabia seems to consist mainly in accepting whatever the Saudis do , no matter how harmful , or whatever they demand , no matter how outrageous , and in supplying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the F-15s we have promised the Saudis would be as useless to them internally , and ultimately as dangerous to their own regime , as were the hundreds of F-14s sent to the shah . Neither the F-14s in Iran nor F-15s in Saudi Arabia could help in suppressing internal threats . Nor could the Saudis be of much help to us in the event of outright Soviet aggression . But those weapons ? in the wrong hands ? could be used against us if , for example , we had to help secure the oilfields . Our eagerness to " recycle " those billions of dollars in the easiest and quickest way we know how , by selling Saudi Arabia the most advanced , and thus the most expensive weapons , takes precedence over caution and good sense . If our aim is to preserve the current Saudi regime , not because they are our " friends " but simply because what might replace them would be worse , our policy undermines that aim . Within the Saudi Air Force and the other advanced military units we are helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of rival tribes ; religious militants who regard the House of Saud and its luxury as decadent ; Marxists ; and other disaffected groups and individuals ( including not only foreign workers but ambitious royal family members , who may be unhappy with their low positions on the family totem pole ) . The creation of elite cadres , just like the Air Force cadets in Iran who proved to be the shock troops of Khomeini 's revolution , and increased access to powerful weapons , such as planes and tanks , is the textbook way to make a coup more possible and more likely . The men who make our policy for the Arab oil states hardly seem to be exercising their minds . How much easier it is to tell oneself and others that , after all , there are differences between Iran and Saudi Arabia , and that a country drowning in wealth is an unlikely target for revolution . How much easier to insist that we must make do with our present passivity , with continued submission to whatever the House of Saud tells us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bad for them , and bad for us.
