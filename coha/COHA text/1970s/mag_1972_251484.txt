Every morning , before Richard Sprague climbs into his black Chrysler , a bodyguard checks the car for a bomb . This is because Sprague , as first assistant district attorney in Philadelphia , has sought a first-degree murder conviction in 66 cases and got what he wanted in 65 . Two convictions were against killers of United Mine Workers Official Joseph Yablonski , and word came from the minefields that there was a contract out on Sprague 's life . Sprague does n't take the threat seriously . The people who work for him do . <P> Now 46 , Sprague is one of the most effective prosecutors in the nation . A short , intense man with sad , hound-dog eyes , he acts as the executive officer directly under the elected district attorney , Arlen Specter . Specter sets the guidelines and runs the politics . Sprague gets the convictions-from murder to petty bribery . " He is seething with righteous indignation , " says one judge who has handled Sprague 's cases . " Some men are like a tiger . Dick Sprague is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank God . But you can feel the power that 's there . " <P> One of Sprague 's most celebrated cases occurred in 1961 , when he decided to prosecute a man for the first-degree murder of his wife even though no body , no blood , no physical evidence of violence was ever found . Sprague argued that no woman would willingly disappear without taking her bridgework , her clothes and cosmetics . <P> " The defense was good , " another lawyer recalls , " and of course their case was that she simply had a fight and walked out . Just before the trial ended , a strange woman suddenly walked into the courtroom . The jury looked at the woman , and the defense lawyer said : ' You see ? It is going through your minds . That woman could be the missing wife . ' " Then , Sprague himself recalls , " I said : ' Yes , you looked at that woman . But I was looking at the defendant and he did n't look . Because he knows there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The jury brought in a verdict of death . <P> The key to Sprague 's success , says one judge , " is the logic of the case as he puts it together . It just grinds ahead like a river of lava , crushing everything in its path . " That logic derives from meticulous preparation . When the Yablonskis were murdered in their beds in Clarksville , Pa. , the local prosecutor knew the case was too big to handle , so Sprague was asked to take charge . By that time , the FBI had captured one gunman , Claude Vealey . He led the FBI to four others : Aubran Martin , a baby-faced hoodlum ; Paul Gilly , a burglar ; his wife Annette , and Silous Huddleston , Annette 's father . Vealey had confessed , but his story was not enough to take all of the culprits to trial .
