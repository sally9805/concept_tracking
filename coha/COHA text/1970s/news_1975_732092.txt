To many observers , the SALT talks are the real litmus test of relations between Washington and Moscow . Mr. Ford remains anxious to hammer out the final details on a new agreement before the end of the year ; a summit meeting with Soviet party chief Leonid I. Brezhnev is slated for sometime in the fall , but may depend on whether enough progress is made on SALT to warrant a meeting .
