txt One of the fascinations of every World Series is the improbable heroes it almost always creates . And if anyone thinks this year 's contestants , the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers , can escape this strange phenomenon , he doubtless will be proved wrong . Usually it 's an obscure pitcher or some .240 hitter who steals all the adjectives out of the rhetoric barrel . But occasionally an aggressive manager , or even a pinch hitter , will get into the act . For example , back in 1954 manager Leo Durocher of the old New York Giants kept sending reserve outfielder Dusty Rhodes up as a pinch hitter against the Cleveland Indians . Rhodes iced game No. 1 for the Giants with a pinch home run ; had a pinch single and a home run in game No. 2 after staying in the lineup ; and came through with another pinch single in game No. 3 . The Giants , underdogs when the Series started , won in four straight . Return with us now to Oct. 3 , 1947 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field in Game 4 of the World Series . Standing on the mound for New York in the last of the ninth inning , leading 2-1 , is Floyd ( Bill ) Bevens , a journeyman pitcher with a dual history of arm and control problems . Yet despite 10 bases on balls ( including two in the fifth inning , plus a sacrifice and an infield out that gave the Dodgers their only run ) , Bevens is working on a no-hitter. // There are two Dodgers on base and two out when 34-year-old Cookie Lavagetto , who had almost been cut in spring training and had been playing all season on borrowed time , comes to the plate as a pinch-hitter . Lavagetto misses Bevens 's first pitch by a mile . Still , this is one Cookie that does n't crumble . He hits Bill 's next pitch high off the right-field wall for a double . Both runners score , the Dodgers win 3-2 , and Bevens loses his no-hitter . Would you believe that neither man ever played another big league game ! The Miracle 1914 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball history to come from last place on the Fourth of July to win the pennant . Actually it did n't seem like too good an idea at the time , because waiting for the braves in the World Series were Connie Mack 's Philadelphia Athletics , a team many experts considered unbeatable . What neither the Athletics nor anyone else had counted on was Braves catcher Hank Gowdy , a .243 hitter during the regular season , , batting .545 in the World Series and leading his team to a four-game sweep . Gowdy also had five extra base hits , including a home run and triple . If you have never heard of Pepper Martin and the way he ran Philadelphia out of the 1931 Fall Classic , then you have missed one of baseball 's best stories . Martin , who liked to race midget automobiles when he was n't stopping ground balls at third base with his chest , was not the game 's best fielder . But give him his head on the bases and he became in baseball lore " the Wild Hoss of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athletics ' All-Star catcher , with his base stealing , and he also wore out a few Philadelphia pitchers by batting .500 . Yet prior to this Martin had always been overshadowed by his teammates . Of course sometimes the reverse can happen in a World Series , making a goat out of a man who was a superstar during the regular season . For example , Hall of Famer Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox hit a mere .200 in the , only Fall Classic in which he appeared . Gil Hodges , normally one of the . game 's most consistent hitters , once went through an entire seven-game World Series without a base hit . And then there was the time that Walter Johnson , possibly the best right-hander in tory , allowed 15 hits in one World Series game . Or how about Carl Hubbell , the king of the screwball , giving up seven runs in one inning ? So do n't look for heroes in this year 's Fall Classic merely among the Reggie Smiths : , Steve Garveys , Ron Guidrys , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some littlf guy who was a banjo hitter during the regular season , but who grows instant muscles the moment all that World Series money is me tioned !
