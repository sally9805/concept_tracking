Underground newspapers are notoriously under-read , under-circulated and over-persecuted . But the case of La Cause du Peuple , the organ of France 's outlawed Maoist proletarian movement , is extreme . It is not printed to be read , but to be seized by the authorities . <P> Since it began two years ago , the bimonthly paper has had three editors . The first two are in jail for inciting public disorder . Their conviction last May touched off clashes reminiscent of the 1968 student uprisings in Paris . The third editor is Jean-Paul Sartre , 65 . <P> The father of existentialism and refuser of the Nobel Prize explains that he did not accept the editorship so much " to defend La Cause du Peuple as to defend the liberty of the press . " He does not align himself with the rabid left-wing advice blazed in La Cause 's headlines to " Enlist everybody in the Guerrillas . " Yet the paper does report with surprising accuracy riots , demonstrations and strikes . By becoming editor , he hoped to defend freedom of expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indignant that the French government refuses to seize him , Sartre says : " If the government would prosecute me , it would not be able to prevent my trial from becoming a political one . " <P> Cause Clbre . The result is a grotesque charade . For the past six months , gendarmes have stormed a Montmartre printing plant once each fortnight . There they seize and confiscate every issue of La Cause they can find . But the sly old iconoclast long ago found a secret printing press to publish about 5,000 copies . On publication day , Sartre and a few friends ( including Film Directors Jean-Luc Godard and Louis Malle , and his longtime companion , Simone de Beauvoir ) pick up the papers , transport them to a side street near St.-Germain-des-Prs , and begin to peddle them . Then the police arrest everyone giving away , selling or reading the paper . Everyone , that is , except prominent people and , of course , Sartre and De Beauvoir , who stay on to deliver diatribes about the rape of press freedom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sartre . " I am not convicted , nor am I interrogated , " he says . " But the printer of the paper is apprehended . " It was De Gaulle who once expressed the absurdity of arresting Sartre for his writings and actions . " One does n't arrest Voltaire . " <P> Last week Sartre took a new tack . Instead of bringing out La Cause on its usual Monday , he published the paper on Friday , and kept carefully out of sight . Instead , representatives of well-known left-wing Paris papers , publishers and owners of leading bookshops went to the printing plant and picked up La Cause . For once , the paper went on sale without being seized .
