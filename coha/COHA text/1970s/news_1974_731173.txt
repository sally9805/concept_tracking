txt Can U.S. oil companies get enough money ? perhaps $600 billion over the next 10 years ? to develop new domestic energy sources , without gouging the American public ? American oil firms , estimates John Emerson , energy economist of the Chase Manhattan Bank , will need to invest perhaps $300 billion in direct " petroleum needs . " They also will play , he adds , an " extremely heavy " capital role in the development of oil from shale , coal gasification , and other energy processes . The need of U.S. oil giants to raise these huge sums of money ? if Americans are going to approximate energy self-sufficiency ? coincides with the white-hot glare of publicity on the firms ' soaring 1973 profits . Exxon says its profits last year were 59 percent higher than in 1972 . Other U.S. oil companies have announced , or will shortly , similar 1973 profit gains . Lower profits Sen. Henry M. Jackson ( D ) of Washington , with other lawmakers and reflecting widespread public sentiment , brands such profits as " unconscionable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for gasoline and heating oil . Are oil profits out of line ? " If 1973 oil company profits are properly analyzed , " declared Mr. Emerson , " they will be seen as nothing out of the ordinary . " He puts them into the context of the past five years . " In 1972 , " says Mr. Emerson , " the profits of some oil companies were lower than they were in 1968 . " He averages oil industry profits over the last five years and comes up with an 8 or 9 percent figure ? well within the middle range of American industry in general . " Money , " declared U.S. energy chief William E. Simon recently , " will go where there is a reasonable return . " // *Finding new sources of energy with whose money ? // " If , " said Exxon chairman J. K. Jamieson , " we can look forward in 1974 and future years to averaging a 14 to 16 percent rate of return on investment , we can live and do the job we have to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added , was 19 percent , compared to 13 percent the year before . The job to which Mr. Jamieson referred includes ? not only for Exxon , But for other major firms ? building new refineries ( at $300 million to $500 million apiece ) , and drilling for offshore oil on the U S. continental shelf . The risk factor in these myriad ventures , stresses Mr. Emerson , varies widely . " Given the refinery shortage , " he noted , " putting up a new refinery could be done with almost 100 percent debt " ? i.e. , external borrowing . A new refinery is " low risk , " in that it would have a guaranteed market for its output . The United States , says Mr. Simon , needs 60 new refineries over the next 10 years . New tax bites The risk , however , is much greater on " very highly speculative " ventures , said Mr. Emerson , such as offshore drilling . This might require almost 100 percent equity financing ? money earned by the oil firm itself . " Rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the U.S. oil industry must generate at least 75 percent of its capital needs from internal financing . " New tax bites on oil companies proposed by President Nixon are , according to tax specialists , merely nibbles , which if enacted would not seriously deplete industry profits . The question is , whether Congress , in the supercharged atmosphere of public resentment at high oil prices and profits , will enact more punitive , measures . Steady deterioration " In December , " editorializes the Wall Street Journal , Congress " came within a whisker of passing a bill to hold the oil companies ' profits to their 1967-71 average , which would have guaranteed a steady deteri  --  ration in the nation 's energy supplies and put beyond hope any movement toward self-sufficiency . " " If the oil industry , " remarked an energy specialist , " is milked of its profits for public relations reasons , government will have to turn around and put the money back into the industry . " A closer role between the energy industry and government may , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( FEO ) director Simon , are various forms of government-industry partnership . Another FEO study will soon be published : the profit record of the U.S. oil industry over the past 15 years , compared to other sectors of American business .
