There are two main dramatic uses of memory . One is retributive , and the other is alchemistic . In retributive memory , the playwright squares accounts with the past , attempting to wrest present justice from past injustice . Arthur Miller 's The Price is a perfect example . In alchemistic drama , the goal is to transmute the heavy base metals of the past into present lyric gold , as Tennessee Williams did in The Glass Menagerie . Generally speaking , the main thrust of retributive drama is moral , and that of alchemistic drama is aesthetic . <P> While Paul Zindel is not on a writing par with Miller or Williams , he and his characters have a joint account , both retributive and alchemistic , and draw most of their dramatic funds from the memory bank . In his new play , And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little , Zindel seems to be overdrawn at the memory bank . His wacky humor is present , along with his abrupt pathos , a way he has of pulling the rug out from under the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , the plot , point , purpose and direction of the play seem to have been lost . <P> Tell and Tell . The story concerns three teacher sisters for whom life has proved a bad trip . Catherine Reardon ( Estelle Parsons ) is a lush . Her younger sister Anna ( Julie Harris ) is a vegetarian , and that is the least of her nuttiness . The married sister Ceil ( Nancy Marchand ) is a cool and predatory school superintendent who seems to have frozen into her post . Anna has been involved in some vague sexual incident with a boy at her school , and Ceil has shown up with the papers to have her committed to an asylum . Catherine and Ceil spar on the subject , and the strange life they led with their divorced mother is dredged up , but nothing changes substantially . What should be show-and-tell is mostly tell-and-tell . <P> What is left is an abundant supply of jokes together with jarring poignancies . The two interrupt each other like hot and cold running water . Some super performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girl Lost so often that she can sleepwalk her way through the part , but she is too much of a trouper not to do it beautifully . Nancy Marchand is as flinty as the Maine coast . As a visiting fellow teacher , Rae Allen is a delightful vulgarian , and lard would not melt in her mouth . Top honors go to Estelle Parsons , caustically jovial , slapping her consonants with the back of her tongue , and looping about her housely chores while knocking back the gin and nibbling raw hamburger hidden in a Fanny Farmer box . Vote her the girl you would most like to go on a bender with . <P> * T.E . Kalem
