GABE Do n't call me boy . HENRY Gabie boy is playing he 's a man . GABE knocks HENRY out of his seat . He laughs . GABE Oh , those are fighting words , Henry . I heard nothing like that from you since you were fourteen . You called my mother a whore then sicked old Charles on me . HENRY I did n't say I wanted to fight . GABE I heard what you said . HENRY I did n't mean nothing with it . GABE Well , you do n't have to worry , Henry , because I 've been reformed and revised and rehabilitated . I 'm an unabridged , unaggressive pacifist , Henry . I been born again , I seen the light . That 's the Canadian prison system for you , Henry . They take a no good half-breed rough-neck and they put him in the chapel every Sunday , since there 's nowhere else to go and I saw God , Henry . God is where Vonne is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost , Henry . God told me that I should n't fight you , no matter how goddamn stupid you were . ( He makes the sign of the cross on HENRY 's forehead , using his beer as holy water ) Lets pray together , Henry . He pours the rest of the beer over HENRY 's head . p. 18 HENRY Leave go of me . GABE What do we want down here on our knees , Henry ? We 're looking for God . And if we find the bugger , we 'll ask him for what you want most in the whole world . What 's that , Henry ?

( To GABE ) And a pump jockey . p. 19 GABE Your brother runs a one-man garage . HENRY He wants to expand . GABE He 's losing more money than a dirt farmer now . Only way he can expand is to hire me and Louis . Because a half-breed gets minimum wage to do the mule work . HENRY He 's got some things he wants fixed up . Couple of weeks work anyway . GABE And you put him up to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand . Charles . GABE Gets pretty lonely out there on the highway . Nothing to do but jerk yourself off . Henry 's always liked me .

GABE A man wants to work , not afraid of getting dirty , he can dig in , put down roots , make a good life for himself , is n't that true ? HENRY Not around here , Gabe . GABE Does n't worry me . I expect any day now , some big record company executive is going to drive through here in a yellow Lincoln convertible , going to discover me singing by the side of the road and make me a star . p. 20 VONNE Why do n't you try pumping gas ? If big cars impress you . GABE You 're very understanding . VONNE Rosie 's working . In the hotel dining-room . GABE I do n't give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddamn about half the time . The other half he does n't give a fuck . HENRY Norbert 's land is up for taxes . GABE Leave me , Henry . HENRY So you ca n't work for him , I mean . GABE I know what you mean . HENRY If Charles wrote a letter . To the parole office . Said you turned down a job . GABE You make me real tired , Henry . LOUIS Heard about a high steel gang in Cedar Rapids .

Try a little harder . HENRY That 's good money , Gabie , around here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY I got responsibilities . GABE You will have if you take us on . HENRY It 's a start , is n't it ? And nobody is going to pay you for living off the bush , are they ? GABE The thing is , Henry , you got to realize , you 're not buying a " pump jockey , " you 're buying a friend . Two friends . What 's that worth , Henry ? HENRY Working at the gas station could be a hell of a lot better than going back to jail . GABE But you are n't talking like a friend . . . LOUIS What they 're building in Cedar Rapids . . . GABE You 're talking like a soul-saving , do-gooder , social worker . Taking trouble making work for two worthless half-breeds on parole . LOUIS It 's the tallest , highest , biggest , baddest insurance company in the world . Would n't that be something . Working up there , right against the sky ? p. 22 HENRY Going to jail is what is going to happen if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been trying to keep GABE off HENRY 's throat . HENRY does n't seem to realize he 's talking too much . LOUIS gives him up as a lost cause and lets GABE loose . GABE You want your boots licked ? You want your ass kissed ? You want me to take this fucking job ? What do you want me to do first ? LOUIS He 's saying he needs time to think . VONNE Ha . GABE Think ! You know what I think . . . ? LOUIS Shut up , Gabe ! GABE Stoney Mountain is one kind of jail . Jackson 's Super Shell Service Station is another kind of jail . Stoney Mountain costs you more and I think if you 're planning on keeping me in jail , it 's going to cost you . ROSIE I start at two . She gets up . GABE grabs her arm . GABE Rosie always had ambitions . Waiting table . . . ROSIE Washing dishes . . . GABE Whatever . Respectable . Not so rewarding as Vonne there , turning tricks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 23 ROSIE It 's real dull , Gabe . She exits . GABE Then stay here , honey . VONNE ( Calling after her ) It 's the beer talking , Rosie . GABE I 'm not drinking . Louis . He 's the drunken no-good . I 'm the smart ass punk . HENRY Rosie wants you to take the job . GABE She knows where she can stuff it . VONNE Louis does n't need your job , Henry . He 's going to work in high steel construction . LOUIS Right across the border as if it was n't there . Vonne 's coming with me . GABE And you can shut up about Cedar Rapids . VONNE When I get to Cedar Rapids , I 'm going to start all over as a call girl . GABE I 'll kill you , Louis . LOUIS We 're going to build our own high steel project right here in Batoche . GABE Damn right . LOUIS Going to transmit from the top of it . To our Metis brothers . p. 24 GABE That 's right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in Batoche . Going to get a job stake together . VONNE ( With wonder ) Gabie 's taking Henry 's job . HENRY I just want to help , Gabe . GABE I do n't need your help . HENRY Well , sure you do . . . GABE Why , Henry ? HENRY Should be thanking me and Charles . . . GABE Why , Henry ? HENRY Like I said , there 's not much work around here . . . GABE Why , Henry ? HENRY And you 're half-breeds , are n't you ? GABE You know what he wants , Louis ? Take that coil of rope and pipe it up to the ceiling . Like Astounding Tales . Like some Hindu mystical medicine-man . Climb up the rope and disappear . That would be an Indian rope trick with some point to it . HENRY I want you to come and work for me . GABE Would n't it be easy if we just disappeared . Turn white for him , Louis . p. 25 HENRY I just want you to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . HENRY It 's the night shift . I run the station at night . GABE Sure you do , Henry . Sitting up all night with nothing to do , that 's about as far as your abilities stretch . But now you got two half-breeds on parole . So you can sit out on that highway with two half-breeds working for you . HENRY I do n't hold a grudge , Gabe . GABE I read comic books . . . HENRY Well , hell , so do I ! GABE . . . with heroes who can turn into rubber , into plastic . Bullet proof guys . People can fly . HENRY We write the comic books , you know . You 're not so goddamn smart . Goddamn white man writes the goddamn comic books . HENRY leaves and GABE shouts after him , before storming out in the opposite direction . GABE . . . Mounties with sled dogs just as smart as they are . These are the guys I know about . You want me invisible , you 're going to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't see him , but he 's there . p. 26 VONNE Watching Gabie is exhausting . LOUIS He 'll take Henry 's job . VONNE So I see . LOUIS So do n't worry about him . If you want to make him feel better just tell him how Louis Riel told Sir John A. MacDonald that he was the pope of the fucking new world . VONNE Is that all ? LOUIS Tell him how Gabriel Dumont took some spent cartridges and a silver arrow out in the bush . Then he captured three regiments of the Canadian Army , including the Prince Albert volunteers . I made that one up . VONNE Gabriel Dumont trained the birds off the trees . Charmed the birds and the bees . LOUIS And the loaves and the fishes . Christ , he 's better than church . In the parking lot or field behind the hotel , GABE sings to himself . ROSIE enters during the song . GABE ( Sings ) I gave my girl friend a transistor radio She cuts me off all day I gave my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I got a girl friend who 's wired to the sound Of a country and western deejay .

I gave you a transistor radio I did not count the cost I gave you a transistor radio I did not count the cost We can both plug in so let 's begin But we got our wires crossed . p. 27 ROSIE Thought you were up on your soap box . GABE Passing through , Rosie . Would n't want to bore you . ROSIE Everyone for forty miles around thinks you and I are going to settle down . Except you . GABE Rosie reading movie magazines and true confessions . Amadee Forget falling down drunk all over you and you 're watching the ceiling with bubble gum music in your head . ROSIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure I do . You think I 'm something . You think I 'm getting out of Batoche and I 'm going to take you with me . You think you 're going to have a house with one bedroom for us and one for the girls and one for the boys . And those little boys and girls are going to get tucked up in their little white sheets . And you and I are going to be screwing around all night . On black satin sheets . They sell those in the movie magazines , do n't they ? ROSIE ( Laughing ) Does n't have to be black . GABE And I 'll be so tired I 'll hardly make it down to somebody else 's service station . You got ver romantic ideas , Rosie . ROSIE You been talking to Kenny Mitchell . p. 28 GABE They been talking to me , sweet little girl , but that 's not what they 're saying . Kenny says you damn near froze his ass to the dashboard of McQuarrie 's pick up truck . ROSIE I damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROSIE Because I had no more vouchers for panty hose and how am I going to explain that to the Welfare . GABE Yeah , I heard that . ROSIE Gabe ? GABE What ? ROSIE Did you ask Kenny about me ? GABE Yes . ROSIE Were you mad ? GABE Why would I be mad ? ROSIE Why did you ask him ? GABE What am I supposed to do ? I come back here , first thing I understand is Norbert 's daughter , Rosie , is all set up for me , not that anybody except Rosie thinks that 's a good idea . So all of them are making sure I hear about Kenny Mitchell and the long cold winter when there 's nothing else to do . ROSIE You know a lot of girls . p. 29 GABE I 've been in jail for three years , Rosie . I got political instead . ROSIE You used to know a lot of girls . GABE Yeah . ROSIE When you went to jail , that was because of a woman . GABE Like I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk because those two cowboys beat up a girl you knew . GABE I do n't need an excuse to get drunk . ROSIE But you had one . GABE I love women . I love talking and women and everything that takes all your mind and your time . Everything except Jackson 's gas station , which is not a consuming interest . ROSIE Are you leaving ? GABE Nothing going around here . ROSIE Louis is here . GABE Talking in the beer parlour . ROSIE You like talking . GABE More than you can fathom , is it ? ROSIE Maybe . p. 30 GABE Talking when it takes all my mind . Talking when I care about it . Just talking , I get tired . Why not ? I 've been talking crazy since I got here and now I 'm sitting here like my father 's beside me and a hundred ghosts , making some kind of holy agreement with them . I wo n't talk again . What 's the use of talking . What else is there to do ? ROSIE Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a pretty girl , Rosie . ROSIE Did you miss me ? GABE No . ROSIE Crazy bastard . GABE I do n't need people . ROSIE Save for Louis . GABE And I do n't need him for damn sure . Not when he 's sitting around like you and Henry Jackson . Living in some happy time when I lead you and Vonne and Henry out of the wilderness . ROSIE Crazy bastard . GABE I do n't need the wilderness . I 'd rather steal cars , Rosie . Or set fires . ROSIE For your Metis brothers . GABE It could be . p. 31 ROSIE Why do n't you go to Regina and sit in the lobby of the Parliament Buildings . Why do n't you sit on top of the Parliament Buildings ?

Man with that kind of business is the foundation of the community . GABE How 's business , Henry ? LOUIS Who 's that giggling ? GABE What 's Vonne doing behind the gas pump ? HENRY Got a visitor dropped by to see you . VONNE Two visitors . p. 32 HENRY You are n't visiting , Ee-vonne . You make this place feel homey . GABE Rosie . Oh , Christ . ROSIE Keeps things lively .

HENRY Got the idea out of Popular Mechanics . Where 's the one I want here . . . GABE has picked up a piece of the paper and glances at it idly . p. 33 GABE Jesus , Henry , this looks more like a cat-house than a gas station . HENRY ( To LOUIS ) That 's the front view . That 's from the side road . Shows the new outbuilding . That 's like a floor plan . From up above . LOUIS You been working on this all day ? HENRY All week . LOUIS Think the trade will justify it ?

VONNE and ROSIE cheer . VONNE Says what he means and he means what he says . ROSIE And he 's buying again . VONNE Ray . Ray . Ray . HENRY What do you think of that ? Pause . p. 35 LOUIS ( Finally ) It 's kind of you , Henry . Is n't it , Gabe ? GABE You 're a prince , Henry . HENRY Now it was n't all my idea . No . It was Vonne , too . Wanted to make sure you got the right kind of welcome , did n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about Henry 's radio , it has this plug here , you can stick it in your ear . She does , and starts to dance . HENRY I told her , Vonne , a gas station , it does n't seem to be much for a party atmosphere and she told me that it was having your friends around you made a party , even if all you were doing was passing a bottle around in a circle at the side of the road . GABE All we are doing Henry . LOUIS ( To HENRY , but for GABE 's benefit ) Nights like this , with your friends around you . Makes it all worthwhile . HENRY ( To LOUIS ) Something I wanted to talk to you about . LOUIS What ? HENRY You and Vonne should get together . p. 36 GABE Vonne 's all wired up to your transistor radio . ROSIE Shut up , Gabe . HENRY ( To LOUIS ) You should ask her to dance or something . GABE She 's dancing . She do n't need encouragement . HENRY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I could n't do that . HENRY Go on . She likes you . GABE Oh , Christ . LOUIS I thought you and Vonne . . . HENRY She likes you . GABE Oh , Christ . LOUIS ( To HENRY ) You think so ? GABE I think this whole goddamn thing is crazy . ( To LOUIS ) Where do you think you 're going ? LOUIS Dance with Vonne . GABE She 's a three fifty ticket or a big wide smile . You know that , Louis . LOUIS Fuck off ! p. 37 GABE Well , I had enough of your party , Henry . . . LOUIS Vonne ? GABE Vonne is bouncing up and down , saying she likes country music when it 's just her pants are hot . LOUIS ( To HENRY ) She 's not listening . GABE ( To HENRY ) And the whiskey 's rotgut . HENRY Well , there 's more . Hell . GABE And Rosie 's watching me as if that passed the time . LOUIS ( To himself ) Well , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LOUIS ( To VONNE ) Vonne , well , I thought . . . VONNE ( Jumping in ) What ? LOUIS ( Awkward ) I 'm beginning to like you . When 's your birthday . Ha . GABE sings . LOUIS and VONNE dance . GABE ( Sings ) I met a man who said to me The Metis nation 's proud and free And you and me can show them what to be I felt the glory , seen the light But I end up here every night Eating shit and bored out of my tree . I should have known it was n't true In fact I guess I know I knew I knew that I had heard his con before He 's a rodeo rider who forgot his horse And he do n't have much to do of course Save for jumping on and off a two-bit whore . HENRY loves the song . He sings the second verse again . GABE cuffs him hard enough to knock him over . p. 38 GABE You 're so stupid , Henry . HENRY You 're kidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? HENRY Haywire smart ass bastard . ROSIE Just leave him . HENRY Gone too far . LOUIS Leave him , Henry . GABE What she wants you to do , Louis , is tear the goddamn radio off her ear , rip her blouse open . Back her up against a wall somewhere so Henry can watch . LOUIS Leave me , Gabe . HENRY He wants a fight , he 's asking for it . LOUIS No , he is n't . HENRY I 'll fight him for you . VONNE ( With the transistor radio ) Take this , Henry . Stick it in your ear . LOUIS He wants a few speeches . A few fine thoughts . GABE More than that . LOUIS Gabe 's very bright . Managed to go through eight years of church school without finding that out . Used to ask questions and the answers were n't in the books . Got his knuckles rapped. p. 39 GABE Beat me for it . LOUIS Out of school with nothing to do but get in trouble . Finally made three years worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used to putting on a great amount of style . Gabe was listening . . . he had too much time to think . . . you remember what I told you ? GABE I 'll kill you , Louis . LOUIS I told him things he could be proud of . How the Indians lived before the whites came and about their ideas of property , how property was held in common . And I told him what I thought that private ownership did to people . That some people had and others had not . And that set-up can get kind of like a jail outside a jail , so pretty soon people can be born and live and die , having not , and their children the same . I gave him a lot of attention . He misses it . He 's jealous , Vonne . Do n't notice him . GABE You bastard ! LOUIS I 've been in jail a lot and I talk a lot in jail to pass the time . Because the conversation is not so stimulating in the ordinary way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here dying . LOUIS You think you 've got the answers now . You want to be a circuit riding preacher and you want me to carry your cross . p. 40 GABE I do , yes . LOUIS I 've done the circuit breaking wild horses . I 've had it . GABE What 's the use of talking ? LOUIS I think I made more money than you 'll ever see . All off the rodeos . And I spent it all living higher than you 'll ever want to . . . than I hope you 'll ever want to . Almost killed myself spending it . I got myself drunk as a skunk on very old special brandy , drove my great big yellow convertible off a bridge into the mighty Saskatchewan River . Got out of hospital to find my luck was gone . Well , the big car was gone . I was still as big and brave as hell but I did n't win anymore . Ended up as a rodeo clown , running for a barrel . Quite a figure of fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . So I stopped it . I got no intention of starting over . What do you think of that ? GABE I think you 're talking fine again . Talking poetry . Talking pretty . Talking shit . LOUIS It 's not so much what you say , it 's how you say it and if you say it so it sounds good enough , there 's people going to believe it . You should leave off telling stories . Since you end up lying to yourself . You should try and learn a trade . GABE picks up HENRY 's whiskey bottle . p. 41 GABE You know what I think ? I think I can finish this bottle in one swallow . Want to bet , Louis ? Watch me . LOUIS No need to go that far . ROSIE Gabie drinks like a kid . GABE drains the bottle . The others watch . GABE By Christ , you 're all looking at me like I was a bomb . Exploding . By Jesus . I see why you do it , Louis . Why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GABE You do n't know my style . LOUIS You 're not a drinker . GABE Henry will listen to you . Vonne will listen to you . Because they are shit heads . They got nothing else to do . VONNE Vonne is drinking . GABE So am I , Vonne . He takes VONNE 's bottle . VONNE Just shove it up your ass , Gabe . LOUIS Leave it ! GABE Leave me ! LOUIS Goddamn kid ! All right ! ( LOUIS leaves ) p. 42 GABE Watch me , Rosie . I can finish this one too . ROSIE ( Exits ) I 've seen that done , Gabe . GABE You 've seen nothing ! HENRY Yippee , Gabie ! VONNE Shut up , Henry . HENRY You see that ? That 's the second bottle he 's got there . Is n't that something ? VONNE Thought you were going to beat him for me ? HENRY By Jesus , I would n't go near him . I seen him crazy drunk before . VONNE You can wait till he falls over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I never seen him so drunk as he 's getting right now . VONNE Maybe he 'll rush the gas station , Henry . Maybe you should plan on holding him off . HENRY Where 's he gone ? Where is he ? In fact , GABE has wandered off with the remains of the bottle . VONNE Right behind you . HENRY What ? Shit , Vonne , no , he is n't . Say . . . p. 43 VONNE What ? HENRY You remember what happened when Charles got hold of that dog of Gabe 's , used to follow him round . That orange dog . The one that pissed in Charles ' hat that time . VONNE Good-bye , Henry . HENRY Vonne ? HENRY trails out after VONNE as GABE and ROSIE enter through the hotel to the exterior area at the rear of the hotel . ROSIE Henry does n't know what you 're talking about . GABE When ? ROSIE When you tell him how stupid he is . If he did know , he 'd kill you . GABE Henry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks that makes him a full scale Indian . ROSIE So do you . GABE Sure . ROSIE You think it 's special being Indian . Sure there 's a whole government department set up for you , but they 're white , they do n't know what they 're doing . They do n't understand you at all . They do n't know how drunk you can get and they do n't know how stupid you can be . GABE And you think just because a couple of nuns taught you how to run an adding machine , you 're going to be a guiding light for the check-out girls at an IGA store in Saskatoon . p. 44 ROSIE ( Laughs ) I do not . GABE Shit , Rosie , next thing you 'll be telling me you want to go to teacher 's college . This ROSIE finds terribly funny . GABE is not amused . ROSIE Next thing I 'll say I want to be a nun . GABE Sure . You want out of here and you want me to take you out . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shows , does n't it ? I do n't look greasy , do I ? Catch me in a dim light , I might not be Indian at all . ROSIE You play the part real well . GABE Meaning ? ROSIE You act like you 're the band chief looking for the last buffalo . GABE I know what I am . ROSIE What are you cleaning that gun for ? GABE It 's my gun . It should be clean . ROSIE You 're on parole . GABE I 'm going hunting . ROSIE You 're on parole . You work at Jackson 's Gas Station . GABE Jesus , you do . You sound like a little white school-teacher , you know that . p. 45 ROSIE I do nt . . . GABE I 'm sick of it . I 'm sick of Jackson 's Gas Station and I 'm sick of you following me around and I 'm going out in the bush . I 'm going to stay there till I got some peace again and Jackson 's not going to do anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back . Because I 'm just another crazy Indian . They locked up all the crazy Indians , they 'd have no place to build hockey rinks . As GABE exits , the lights come up on Jackson 's Service Station . HENRY , VONNE and LOUIS enter , ROSIE joins them . HENRY Well , if he 's going off , I 'll tell you one thing . I 'm not holding his job open for him . We got to get them renovations finished . Yes sir , first person who comes out here , looking for work , the job 's theirs if they want it . If they 're qualified . LOUIS Gabe 's got the qualifications . HENRY Well , he 's handy . ROSIE He used to stay with us young kids when my mother and father went off . Drinking . Two , three days at a time . One time it was three weeks , but I was older then and I think that was after . . . no , that was the same summer Gabie went haywire . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks . She looked like Gabie 's sister , last time I remember her . He do n't know who his father was . p. 46 HENRY He 's too wild . ROSIE I do n't remember him like that . I remember him telling the little kids stories , comic book stories , but he 'd make them up and I was the oldest girl . HENRY He only stayed around you because his ma was off to Regina , wearing silver slippers . You 'd be better off with me , Rosie , if I 'd have you . VONNE She do n't want you , Henry . You 're simple . HENRY Gabe wo n't have her . The thing about that bastard is , he 's got women flying over him , taking leaps at him . That Kennedy 's wife thinks he 's a hell of a stud . She 's been driving their Chevy six miles down here so Gabe can top off the gas tank , she 'll make it six miles back . Give Rosie a drink , Louis . LOUIS passes ROSIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got another twenty-sixer in the truck . HENRY He ever tell you how he came to steal that car ? That was another woman . He hardly knew her . There was a fight outside the beer parlour . Two greasers pulled her into the car . VONNE We want to stop talking about Gabe all the time . HENRY Two mounties standing there laughing . Gabe took off after them . He 's got a mind of his own but he was totalled and he totalled the car , of course . p. 47 VONNE You will understand , Henry , that Louis and I got better things to do . HENRY Well , sure . Keeps things lively . VONNE Is n't that right , Louis ? LOUIS I guess I told him up to thirty , forty times , all about the North-West Rebellion , all about the rodeo . VONNE Is n't that right , Louis . You and I are going to have ourselves a time . LOUIS God loves his soldiers . VONNE Sure he does , honey . LOUIS Dumont was a general . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Did he say where he was going ? ROSIE To the bush . LOUIS Gabe can take care of himself . ROSIE He ca n't stay out of trouble . VONNE Sure . He 's probably off somewhere right now , shooting a hole through his foot . ROSIE I remember Gabie came by one night . Tapping on the window . There was frost in his hair . p. 48 LOUIS Gabe got me to come up here to Batoche with him . He said , it 's my town Louis . You can take it over . They 'll name it after you . HENRY Charles used to beat him up a lot . ROSIE Let 's have a party . VONNE We 're having a party . ROSIE Get the other bottle . VONNE Plenty there still . ROSIE drains the bottle she 's holding . ROSIE Get it , Henry . HENRY Sure . Why not ? LOUIS He 'll tell you I did the talking . Ha . That 's one of his stories . ROSIE Frost in his hair . Pushing snow down my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he wanted . ROSIE It 's no good , is it ? LOUIS Got a mind of his own . ROSIE He 's supposed to be your friend . He did n't even tell you he was going . Sometimes I could kill him , Louis . LOUIS Gone as far as that . p. 49 ROSIE He 's gone off because he thinks nobody tells him what to do . Thing is , everyone tells him what to do . He just does the opposite . LOUIS He 's like you . A blare of music , loud and tinny , badly amplified . HENRY returns with another bottle of whiskey . VONNE And I think we should have a party . HENRY You like that ? I got a loudspeaker wired into the radio in the truck . ROSIE He does n't care about me , does he ? HENRY Popular Mechanics . LOUIS Sure he does . And we care about you . Little Rosie . Sweet little girl . We care about you a lot . VONNE Turn off that radio . ROSIE I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Louis . LOUIS Well , all right then . Well , watch me . ROSIE Dance with me . Watch me . Fuck him . VONNE Turn off that radio . Turn off that fucking radio . ROSIE dances , joined by LOUIS . The music and the dance peak . HENRY watches , very intent . p. 50 ROSIE I do n't care about Gabe . LOUIS It 's okay , honey . It 's all right . VONNE I did n't come out here to watch you two climbing all over each other . HENRY The thing is , Louis , I noticed Wednesday is always a little slow . You got to wait till Friday , if it 's a pay-day Friday , to see any traffic at all on this road . I mean , I figure we could knock off for a while , Louis , what do you think . Not up to Gabe to have all the fun , is it ? Louis ? What do you say ? Louis ? Blackout . @x Lights up on ROSIE and GABE . ROSIE So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's been looking at you and me sideways ever since you came back . So I surprised him . He pretended he could n't stop coughing . GABE Why did you go to confession ? ROSIE You have to if you want to take communion . GABE Why do you want to take communion ? ROSIE I do n't . GABE You 're like me , are n't you ? ROSIE No . GABE Sure you are . Whole town watching your middle for signs of my kid and you end up laying out for all talk no action Louis . Just for the shock of it . Rosie , honey , there 's something real wrong with your head . ROSIE Passes the time . GABE Louis taken with you now ? ROSIE He was drunk . GABE Yeah , well , he 's always drunk . ROSIE I do n't even think he remembers . p. 52 GABE Drunk as a skunk in the cab of another pick-up truck and him talking all the whole time while your head is banging on the dashboard . Little Rosie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , well , I did n't believe him . GABE Why not ? ROSIE It is n't poetry , is it ? GABE Poor Rosie . ROSIE Why poor Rosie ? What do you know ? GABE I know it 's better in bed for one thing . ROSIE You know street tramps in Regina ! GABE I do n't like my women so lonely there 's nothing else for them to do . ROSIE Your women ! GABE I had women when you were wishing I 'd come by and catch frogs with you , Rosie . ROSIE You think you know everything . GABE Damn near . ROSIE You do n't know so much because you make it all up . Your women . You got all your women dressed in silver paper in your head . Speaking French . GABE You going to ask me what happened when I was out in the bush ? p. 53 ROSIE No . GABE You peddling your ass around , you think that 's all that happened ? ROSIE I did n't peddle . . . GABE It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GABE I 'm going to tell you . Did n't have a drink for two weeks . That 's to satisfy the schoolteacher in you that wants me settled down . That 's not the interesting part . I made a fast . ROSIE You mean you went hungry . GABE I lived off that bush when I was younger and stupider than you 'll ever be . . . I mean I did n't eat for two days , almost three . . . just to clear my mind . ROSIE What mind ? GABE There it is . I 'm not eating . I have n't spoken for about a week . I 'm forcing myself to stay awake , just to see what will happen . This is the third day . The sun is coming up . A long pause . ROSIE What happened ? GABE I passed out from the weakness . I woke up , my arm was gone right up to the shoulder , down the throat of a hungry looking wolverine. p. 54 ROSIE What happened ? GABE What happens when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in physical pleasures , you have visions . You go right off your skull . The sun came up over the lake . The lake was on fire . There 's a voice inside my head , but it 's everywhere . Realest thing I ever heard . " Gabe , this is what you 're going to do , I 'll lay it out for you . This is your destiny . " I knew it was n't me talking then . Destiny is not a word I 'd use . ROSIE Then what happened ? GABE Voice kept going . ROSIE What did it say ? GABE I do n't know . I was laughing too hard . ROSIE Because I guess you think you 're very funny . GABE No , it 's true . The whole story . You know what I mean ? ROSIE No . GABE You care ? ROSIE No . GABE You know the only thing that worries me , Rosie ? Sometimes I think I 'm crazy . My father was some wandering white maniac . With an axe . Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happening to him . p. 55 ROSIE Norbert 's crazy . GABE You are n't like Norbert , Rosie . You know it . ROSIE My old man is crazier than you could ever think up . GABE I 'm trying to tell you that I do n't know what I 'm going to do next . Half the time . That I feel crazy , Rosie . Half the time . And the only thing that I can say about what is going to happen . . . I mean , happen to me . . . it 's going to be wild , Rosie , it 's going to be crazy . ROSIE I feel like that . GABE There are words in my head , if I say them , I ca n't understand why there is n't somebody there to answer back . And sometimes I think I know all the answers . Got the questions and the answers all my own in one head . You can see how crazy that is . ROSIE All the things in your head , Gabe , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why you think they 're so big . GABE Sure . Dumont and Riel made it happen . Right ? Almost made it happen . And all I do is come back to Batoche . ROSIE Louis will be glad you 're back . p. 56 GABE Sure . Well , next time , I 'll give you a little warning . Take you both with me . Take three things with me . Rosie . Louis . And a hunting knife . What will you take , Rosie ? ROSIE Black satin sheets . GABE What else ? ROSIE Why are you taking Louis ? GABE All right . Going out in the bush with two things . Rosie and a hunting knife . ROSIE You can take him if you want to . GABE Oh , sure . I can go out in the bush with Louis . With Henry . All the white men of the world . All the losers of the world . I could guide them through the wilderness . ROSIE You like Louis . GABE Or I could do it by myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now can I ? Some of which is overheard by LOUIS and VONNE who enter from the Tahiti Room . LOUIS There 's something we have to settle , Gabe . GABE There 's something I want to finish telling you , Rosie . What happened when I was out in the bush . I followed Norbert 's excuse for a trap-line , mainly . Laughable . When I was young , I lived off Norbert 's traps sometimes . He used to have it together . Christ . Well , it 's one more thing I 'm going to have to learn to do for myself . Right ? p. 57 VONNE Louis went hunting on the week-end . GABE What did you get , Louis ? LOUIS Nothing . VONNE Rabbit . LOUIS Nothing . VONNE Bought three rounds at the Empress Hotel on the strength of them . LOUIS You know what happened while you were gone . GABE Empress sold a lot of beer . LOUIS At the gas station . GABE Trade was not substantial . LOUIS delivers his next speech as a set piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another time . The puncturing of LOUIS 's posture satisfies GABE , he is willing to make peace but finds he 's gone too far . LOUIS Want you to know , Gabe , that it would n't have happened . No . I do n't know what to say . I feel kind of bad . I guess I stepped out of line but I do n't know what to say about it . Is that all right ? GABE What do you mean ? LOUIS Me and Rosie . GABE Christ , Louis . Rosie did n't mind . Pause . LOUIS explodes . p. 58 LOUIS Saskatchewan does not amount to much . GABE Uncivilized . LOUIS There 's other places I could be . GABE Well , sure . LOUIS Going to Cedar Rapids . GABE That 's fine , Louis . LOUIS Do n't believe me , do you ? GABE Sure I do . Sure . It sounds like a good plan . LOUIS You do n't think I 'm going , do you ? You think I 'm shit . You think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name all over it . Watching you hell around like helling around was going out of style . Like there was a future in it . I 've raised more hell than you 'll even get a chance to dream about . GABE Going to get Henry to sell me a car he 's got down at the station . Going to take advantage of his good nature , since he knows what a tough bastard I am . Going to say I 'll give him fifty dollars for it , since it ai n't worth ten . LOUIS I do n't suppose you want a beer . You do n't see the value of it . You 're too good for beer-drinking . GABE I do n't need it . p. 59 LOUIS I need a beer to stomach you . LOUIS exits . GABE Hey , Louis . . . VONNE Prick . GABE Hey , Vonne . . . ROSIE You think you want Henry 's car . GABE I 'll work it over , get it running , get into it and drive until it falls apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and dive right in . ROSIE You do n't have fifty dollars . GABE You do n't understand finance . ROSIE You do n't understand Louis . GABE Lost my train of thought . ROSIE Your train of thought ! You do the talking . You tell the stories . GABE I 'm not talking to you if you 're not talking sense , Rosie . What 's wrong with Vonne ? VONNE Fuck off ! GABE Misses me . Do n't worry , honey . Rosie and I is not significant . Wo n't change a thing . Vonne and I will climb a lot of steps together . ROSIE Your pants are too tight and your hair is too long . There is nothing in your stupid head but you . You want Louis to be one thing . You want me to be one thing . p. 60 GABE I want excitement . There 's a lot finer things in the world than Henry Jackson with his hands in his pockets . Than Batoche . Than a prairie fire . VONNE You can leave Henry out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making fun of him . GABE I love women . Sometimes I get the feeling that 's about all you can count on to surprise you . Be just as pure and fine as the fire on the lake . VONNE You can fuck off . You and your fine fucking talk about big talkers and white men with turnips for brains . GABE Louis not talking to you ? VONNE He 's another one . GABE You got Louis all wrong . He 'll be back . He and I have plans . ROSIE Liar . GABE Sure . We 're going to Cedar Rapids . ROSIE Stop laughing at him . GABE Well , we 're getting out of here for damn sure . Him and I get along . ROSIE Like you and I get along . Like a prairie fire . p. 61 GABE I 'm going to talk to Louis . ROSIE No you are n't . VONNE No more . GABE ( To ROSIE ) Who says ? ROSIE I do . VONNE I do . GABE ( To ROSIE ) Like to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my dead body . GABE Have to do better than that . ROSIE Try and pass me . ROSIE kicks , aiming for GABE 's groin . GABE You stay above the belt , Rosie . Jesus , you do n't know where to start . ROSIE I do what I like . GABE Yippee , Rosie ! ROSIE If you 're going to Cedar Rapids , I 'm going with you . Louis driving your fifty dollar car . And you in the back seat with me , keeping quiet . GABE Ca n't help liking you . VONNE You 're staying off of Louis ' back . p. 62 ROSIE ( As their fight continues ) Crazy bastard ! You and Louis get along , sure you do . If he is playing your rules . If you win . You got nothing going for you but wild crazy talk and there is n't anyone can understand it . Is n't anyone would care if you did make any sense . I want you out of here ! You are n't leaving , Gabe ! ROSIE frantically rushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the following dialogue . VONNE Just one reason he wants to go to Cedar Rapids . Get some quiet drinking done . GABE Now just a minute , Vonne . VONNE And he ca n't do that when you 're around . GABE I 'm not fighting the both of you girls . VONNE You 're too young and stupid for him , Gabie . He remembers what that 's like . He drinks beer about it . He remembers what it 's like and he do n't need you to remind him . GABE I want to explain to you about the victory at Duck Lake . VONNE Suck Duck Lake . GABE When Dumont had twenty-five men on horseback and a few men on foot and Crozier had one hundred soldiers , the Prince Albert volunteers , with cannon . p. 63 VONNE You can leave him in peace . ROSIE You can stay here . You can go . You can make up your mind . GABE See Dumont 's brother , Isidore , went out to meet Crozier 's men . He was waving a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crozier , rather than thinking that he wanted to parlay , figured Dumont was trying to outflank him . VONNE Rather have Louis falling blind drunk . . . GABE So he shot Isidore . . . VONNE . . . falling blind drunk than have you at the best of times . GABE Shot Isidore dead , goddamn it . VONNE I got him Rosie . GABE Well , the Metis did outflank the government men . The government could n't do anything right . They racked up their cannon . They loaded the shell in before the powder so they could n't get the shell out . ROSIE I do n't have to stay here . GABE The Canadians said the Metis fired the first shot . Well , that was a lie . p. 64 ROSIE I do n't have to stay here . I do n't have to listen to you . VONNE We do n't . ROSIE Crazy bastard ! VONNE Come on , Rosie . ROSIE Crazy bastard ! They exit . GABE Crozier claimed heavy casualties on Dumont 's side . Eighty men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight men in the neighbourhood heard the shots . And come to see what was going on . But by the time they got there , the Canadians was long gone . Nothing to see but Louis Riel riding up and down waving a big silver cross . GABE has had much the worse of his battle with the girls . He is flat out , exhausted . LOUIS enters from the bar . LOUIS ( Amused ) You all right ? GABE My hand 's bleeding , that 's all . LOUIS Can you get up ? GABE I can do anything ! Anything ! Ca n't I ? My ears are ringing . Look at that . Blood . Amazing , is n't it ? Reminds me of the time I locked the keys inside an old car I had . I was drinking then . So I said , " we can fix that " and I put my fist through the window and I got the keys and my hand was bleeding and my arm , like it is now . p. 65 LOUIS You hand 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your nose . GABE It 's my head . LOUIS Sit down . Take it easy . GABE You 're all right , are n't you ? Not a mark on you . Not much of a fighter , are you ? LOUIS Got a beer in my hand . GABE I 'll join you . LOUIS First long step to being like me and Norbert . Fucked up traplines , pickled eggs , shuffle board . Draught beer politics at the Empress Hotel . GABE I got my own Temperance League . LOUIS So I 've seen . Got your own code of ethics . Coat of arms . Got your own newspaper . Print your own news . Make every goddamned night at a goddamned half-assed gas station into goddamned opening day at the goddamn Calgary Stampede . GABE So Rosie told me . LOUIS She 's got a way with words . GABE Spellbinder . LOUIS You 've got a good friend in Rosie . p. 66 GABE I appreciate her interest . LOUIS Rosie sees where you 're going . GABE More than I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's kind of funny . I tell you I 'm moving in with Rosie and I tell her I 'm going to Cedar Rapids with you . And what I 'm really going to do is stay in Batoche . End up killing some simple-minded white man like Henry Jackson in a bar room fight that gets out of hand . GABE and LOUIS enter Jackson 's Service Station where HENRY is sitting around with VONNE and ROSIE . HENRY You know , I always had trouble thinking of things to say to people until I read this magazine with some good advice . Talk about what you know about , it said , and if there 's one thing I know about , it 's cars . Well , happens that is something that just about everybody is interested in . Cars . So a good thing to do instead of standing around looking stupid , is to turn to the next fellow . Ask him what kind of car he drives . First time I tried it , the fellow drove a Chevy and he had a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to sell me that Ford you got out back . HENRY Seemed like he 'd keep getting dirt in the fuel line . p. 67 GABE Want to buy that Ford , Henry . HENRY Oh , I could n't do that . GABE Why not ? HENRY Well , it is n't worth much , Gabe . No . You would n't want to buy it . LOUIS He can get it running . GABE Hell , Henry . I wo n't lie to you . I got it running . HENRY Ford out back ? GABE Sure . HENRY That 's something , is n't it ? GABE All the nights out here on the highway when I should have been watching you drink yourself stupid . HENRY That old Ford . GABE Fifty dollars . HENRY What do you want with that old Ford ? GABE Well , the first thing we 're going to do is paint it up like a medicine show . LOUIS That 's because he 's hell for style . GABE The second thing I 'm going to do is take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ? p. 68 GABE Going to wire the whole vehicle for sound . HENRY Got a tip for you there .

GABE That car is going to be powered by sound , Henry . HENRY Needs an FM radio . GABE And then I 'm going to jump parole and drive . HENRY Where are you going ? GABE Where we going , Louis ? HENRY Is Louis going ? GABE We 're all going . HENRY Who ? GABE We 're all going . HENRY Me ? GABE Where we going , Henry ? HENRY Well . Me . Well . Do n't mind if I do . GABE You look to be the kind of man who wants to see the ocean . That 's where we 'll go , Henry . Stopping only in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , where Louis and I , since we 're sure-footed , have a keen sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel construction for a while . p. 69 HENRY All of us ? GABE And Rosie and Vonne are going . Keep that back seat homey . ( The girls are playing cards and GABE includes them in the story ) The girls are going to dress up like gypsies . Tell fortunes .

ROSIE Gabie is a tall dark stranger . Thinks he came from across the sea somewhere . In a boat . To rescue somebody . Looks like a white man with a Bible in his hand . Standing right in front of the sun with a fierce-looking , stupid-looking smile . She pushes the cards she has laid out together and looks up for his reaction . p. 70 GABE Jesus , Rosie . VONNE Want to go to the ocean with him ? ROSIE I want to go to bed with him . VONNE I want to go to Regina . Think he 'll get that far ? GABE Take you where you want to go . Seen the error of my ways . ROSIE I heard that before . GABE Do n't get anywhere by fighting you , do I ? You 're tough , Rosie . Beat me to the floor . ROSIE Because I 'm sick of stories ! GABE Ride the river with you . Sure . Vonne , too . Tough little broads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need is an axe . GABE I need to fly , Rosie . ROSIE I do n't care . GABE You can fly .

You met me when I was a punk kid in the Prince Albert Pen . Singing songs about Gabriel Dumont . GABE sings and LOUIS claps . GABE ( Sings ) Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life gets wearisome The wind 's too cold and the air 's too dry And there 's telephone wires across the sky There 's nothing to do but drink and fight And watch the hockey of a Saturday night . What the white man taught the Metis Told them virtue was its own reward Now they 're waving at their Saviour Louis Riel in a fifty dollar Ford . During this , LOUIS and GABE , followed by HENRY , leave the gas station for the Empress Hotel 's famous Tahiti Room . HENRY is puzzled but eager to take part in whatever fun is going on . p. 73 HENRY Something I want to talk to you about . GABE We 're coming to your part , Henry . Just sit patient . HENRY Something we have to discuss . GABE ( Sings ) It might be Henry Jackson 's dream To score for the Toronto team But me , I 'm leaving this hotel Going to find Dumont and Louis Riel Dumont shot and Louis scored Keeps a man from getting bored . What the white man taught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're waving at their Saviour Louis Riel in his fifty dollar Ford . HENRY ( Clapping along ) Ha ! GABE You see the beauty of it , Henry .

He got some whitewash I was going to show you . I told him how busy we been . GABE No special talents . No fun . No place for him . HENRY Charles figures you 're out of a job . p. 75 GABE I see . HENRY So I ca n't sell you the car , Gabe . GABE Well , shit . HENRY Well , I tried to explain to him . . . GABE Well , I would n't worry , Henry . Kind of funny when you look at it right .

GABE I 'll teach you . HENRY You do n't have to do that . . . GABE I 'm glad to do it , Henry . Friendship . HENRY laughs , uncomfortably . HENRY The reason I like drinking with you is you 're both hellish fine fellows . Hard drinkers . Good company . I like you . There 's only one trouble with you , that 's you 're not responsible . I mean Gabe here , Louis , because you got a head on your shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to take off some place just because he feels like it . Now , I can understand that in a young fellow . Feel like taking off myself sometimes . But you ca n't run a gas station that way . No sir . GABE Your brother 's gas station is n't really running , Henry . It 's just sitting there , looking kind of sad . HENRY Could make something out of that place . Good location . GABE Yeah , it 's peaceful . Do n't get a lot of traffic . p. 77 HENRY If I had help I could depend on . GABE Buy me a drink , Henry . LOUIS You do n't want to do that . HENRY Gabe goes crazy when he 's drinking . GABE I 'm going to get drunk , really drunk . I 'm going to beat him unconscious . I 'm going to steal his fucking car . HENRY I 'm trying to talk sense to you , Gabie . GABE I 'm going to let Henry buy the first round . HENRY You tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're acting foolish , Gabe . GABE Oh yeah ? LOUIS You 're sitting around drinking with a broken down rodeo rider and a half-wit . GABE Nice talk . HENRY Who are you calling a half-wit ? GABE Who 's the broken down rodeo rider , more to the point ? HENRY Who are you calling a half-wit ? GABE I got no quarrel with you , Louis . p. 78 LOUIS Why not ? GABE Get me my own big yellow car some day . Drive it through the biggest towns in Saskatchewan . Sure . Making speeches from the back seat . Have people falling back in amazement , never having heard speaking like it before . It 'll all be true , see . No word of a lie . Talking Metis rights . Singing Metis rights . Get a little fiddle breakdown , we 'll have everyone back on their feet . Dancing on behind me . HENRY Who 's calling who a half-wit ? LOUIS It 's me calling you . You can take it as a compliment . HENRY I take exception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to say that to me . GABE We always say it , Henry . You keep coming back for more . You like the attention . HENRY No drunken lazy , no good dirty Indian 's going to say it , that 's for damn sure . GABE Leave him , Louis . He 's a sick little bastard . LOUIS has HENRY and he 's beating him brutally . GABE tries to separate them . GABE Leave him go , Louis , goddamn it . You 'll kill him . He 's drunk , that 's all . Rest of the week he follows you around like a dog . Goddamn it , you 'll kill him . I do n't understand you . LOUIS has beaten HENRY very badly . He stretches back for one last punch or kick , wonders why he is bothering and drops HENRY to the ground . He takes HENRY 's cigarettes out of his pocket and lights one . GABE watches him . HENRY pulls himself together and out of the bar . p. 79 HENRY Goddamn fucking Louis Riel cowboy movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let him bother you . Jesus , I would have beat him if I thought you wanted it done . He knows me . LOUIS He 's worthless . GABE Sure he is . And that 's why he 's here , goddamn it . Why he wants to be like me . Just like me . Like you . And that 's why he 's going crawling home to Charles right now and Charles is going to send you back to jail so fast . . . HENRY ( As he leaves ) You know what they did to Louis Riel . They hanged the son of a bitch . GABE What are you doing , Louis ? LOUIS I 'm going to go to jail . GABE You go to jail , it 's your own fucking fault . LOUIS I 'm going to jail and you 're not . GABE You 're crazy , Louis . LOUIS I see Gabriel Dumont . He is afflicted and ashamed . He does not look at me . He looks to his future . His present . He is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . GABE Okay . Sure . We 'll go . We 'll steal a car and drive . You want to ? I 've done it before . p. 80 LOUIS The Canadians must punish before they can forgive . I will allow them to punish me again . GABE That 's shit . That 's Riel talking again . LOUIS Riel said : " There will be a trial . I will speak there . I will use it as a platform to talk of Metis rights . The Canadians will listen . There will be an investigation in Parliament . All the grievances , my people 's grievances , will be exposed . I will fulfill my mission . I will speak . . . " LOUIS exits as VONNE enters with ROSIE . VONNE is very angry . VONNE I hate Henry for being so stupid . I hate Henry 's goddamn big brother Charles . I hate Louis for wasting his time with either of them . Louis beats Henry up . Louis goes back to jail , so what good does that do ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take me serious . VONNE And Louis goes to jail for it . GABE Parole . VONNE Parole . GABE Parole violation . VONNE Is that all you can say , parole violation ? Because what is Louis supposed to do ? Let Henry hire him and fire him and call him dirt . He 's supposed to let you beat Henry up because you 're not serious about it . You beating Henry , that does n't count . Keeps things lively . No one holds a grudge about it . No one holds a goddamn grudge and Henry 's little brain just goes on rattling around in Henry 's big thick head while Louis bangs his head against a wall . Parole violation . Parole violation . Parole violation. p. 81 GABE I do n't know what to say , Vonne . Is that all right ? ROSIE Talk to Henry for her . GABE Oh , Rosie , honey . . . ROSIE Charles put him up to it . GABE So what ? ROSIE Henry does n't know anything . GABE Poor old Henry . ROSIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? I could kill him . ROSIE You wo n't . GABE How do you know ? ROSIE It will all strike you funny . At the last minute . You 'll be laughing too hard . GABE I 'd like to go out in the bush again . For a while . No , really . Because I love it . Because the Welfare Department does n't take me serious , that 's for damn sure . And I could get Norbert 's traps together . Christ , that would be a Christian act of mercy . ROSIE Shut up , Gabe . GABE I 'm just telling you . ROSIE You 're making excuses . p. 82 GABE I got no excuse , Rosie . I love the bush and I ca n't take Jackson 's Gas Station serious . I think it looks stupid out there on the highway all by itself . When I 'm working there . . . when I 'm working for Charles , I feel like a rodeo clown . . . ROSIE Well , you are n't . . . GABE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a disaster . I 'm better in the bush . Shit , Rosie , every time I come out of the bush and I 'm still together , Charles and Henry , they see they 're the clowns . ROSIE Charles and Henry never think about the bush . GABE I 'm a comic book hero , Rosie . ROSIE I guess so . GABE You do n't want to go . Do you ? You do n't like the bush . ROSIE I do n't like mosquitoes . I like it in the fall . GABE Little white lies . ROSIE You could be an outlaw . In the woods . Nobody would see you again . Ever . Just tell stories about you . GABE You see too many movies . ROSIE Why not ? GABE You could go to Regina . You and Vonne . Every night they 'd turn the gas-light on . The big glass chandelier . And you 'd come in , down the stairs , eating a flower . Everybody standing around the bottom of the stairs , clapping their fists together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so . GABE You got very romantic ideas . ROSIE Will you talk to Henry ? GABE Jesus , Rosie , I said I would . HENRY enters as ROSIE exits . GABE watches him . Nothing is going on , although when he notices GABE , HENRY pretends to be busy . HENRY What are you doing here ? GABE Come to say good-bye to you . HENRY That 's a stupid thing to do . GABE Because Louis beat you when I should have done it ? Come on Henry , I do n't hold a grudge . HENRY The thing about you is you got no sense of responsibility . You or Louis . None of you . GABE I 'm going off in the woods , Henry . HENRY You are n't going anywhere . You 're on parole . Like Louis was . GABE Going to see how long I last . On my own . No supplies . No pack . No gun . HENRY Parole . That 's a responsibility . That 's an obligation . Parole . That 's a promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of you . p. 84 GABE Us half-breeds are very wily in the woods . HENRY You half-breeds are n't responsible . GABE We 're very close to nature . HENRY You drink too much . GABE When I was a kid , I ran away from the correctional institute . I lived off the land till the break-up . Only year I never got in trouble . Not till spring . Then they finally got it together , came and got me . HENRY Last winter . Over at the Empress . Two half-breeds , a woman and a man , Charles told me . Over there spending their welfare cheques . They left their kids out in their broken down old car with the heat off . The kids fell asleep . Those two were so drunk they drove all the way home , forgot about the kids , left them in the car all night . They froze to death , the kids . That 's half-breeds drinking for you . Or maybe they were Indians . GABE Even if you knew anything about hunting , fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it , you 'd be dead in the bush , Henry . You 're a city man , Henry . You ca n't live by yourself . HENRY Even if you did n't drink , you 'd still have no sense of responsibility . GABE You win , Henry . p. 85 HENRY I 'm not afraid of you . Or crazy Louis . GABE Who ? HENRY Crazy Louis . GABE Louis was n't crazy . HENRY Sure he was . GABE I would n't say that . HENRY Well , it 's true . Beat me up and where did it get him ? Back in the Prince Albert Pen . Sure . Good place for him . Bang his head against the bars crazy . Ha . GABE Nothing crazy about beating you . Would n't want you to think that . HENRY You 'd never get away with it . GABE I would n't beat you , Henry . HENRY No . GABE All of us half-breeds are very sociable . HENRY Yeah . GABE True ? HENRY Hell , I know that . GABE Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you 're right there . GABE Friendly . Give you the shirt off my back . You want it ? p. 86 HENRY Well , I got a shirt like it . GABE And I do n't have to beat you , Henry . Because all of us half-breeds , we 're hunters . We got special knowledge . Of the future . When my hand moves like this , that means something 's going to happen . Or when there 's a twitch in my neck . Here . HENRY Like the time you told me that the spring flooding was going to knock the bridge out and I told Charles and he did n't believe me . So he drove into town and stranded himself . Had to stay overnight . GABE That 's right . HENRY Wonderful thing . GABE Sure . I can see things you ca n't see . Like Louis Riel . Riding out of Montana . Saw a tree on the hill . And he said to Dumont . That 's a tree , is n't it ? I thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You and Louis Riel . I heard that before . GABE I can see you beaten . HENRY What ? GABE It 's a vision . I can see you lying there on the floor , looking like something out of one of those comic books . Not the ones with the people . The animal books . Where the stupid looking cat gets rolled out and hung up to dry . p. 87 HENRY Rolled out ? GABE Lying there , Henry . Looking stupid . HENRY Where ? GABE I guess someone 's finally done it right . Someone 's finally kicked your teeth down your throat . HENRY You ? GABE Not me . You got to understand I 'm not threatening you , Henry . I think it 's comical . I think it 's kind of sad in a way . HENRY I do n't know what you 're talking about . GABE Because you 're stupid , Henry . Because you 're not afraid of me . Or Louis . Because you think we 're crazy . You do n't have the brains of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairie sunset . Fade to black . ( END OF PLAY. )
