According to an old saw , if a chimpanzee is allowed to punch the keys of a typewriter at random for a long enough time , it will eventually peck out Hamlet . Lana , a playful three-year-old female chimpanzee at Emory University 's Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center , will never accomplish that feat , but she is already one up on the hypothetical chimp . Under the tutelage of the center 's scientists , Lana is rapidly learning how to read and write in a brand-new language called Yerkish . <P> Chimps are perhaps the most intelligent of all apes , and others before Lana have acquired sign-language vocabularies of more than 100 words . But Lana 's teaching system is based on a computer , which she can operate at will by pressing large keys on a console . On each of the variously colored keys is a different geometric form ; the forms are the words-or " lexigrams , " as the scientists call them-of Yerkish . When Lana presses a key , the symbol flashes overhead on a screen and its English equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Lana 's instruction began with a simple search-and-reward system . If she happened to press the symbol for M &; M chocolates , for example , the computer would promptly drop a piece of the candy from a vending device . As soon as Lana began associating symbol and reward , the scientists required her to touch a new symbol for " please " before she pressed the M &; M key , and then to hit another key for " period . " If Lana failed to hit all three of the symbols in the proper sequence , the candy would not appear . Next she had to add verbs like " give " and " make " before she got her reward . Finally , she had to form whole sentences . <P> An apt pupil , Lana quickly learned how to get her fill of her favorite grape juice ( " Please machine give juice period " ) or pieces of banana . But could she also learn to pay heed to the symbols displayed on the screen-in effect , to read ? <P> Lana 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please machine give ... " Almost always , Lana punched out the correct completion . When the researchers tried to trick her with jumbled syntax-like " Please make machine ... " - Lana usually wiped out the sentence by indignantly punching the period key , which cleared the computer and the screen . <P> So far Lana has learned about 75 words-which her trainers regard as only a start . As they teach Lana more words they hope to increase their understanding of how chimps actually learn a language , and to gain new insights into how those skills are acquired by humans . What they learn could eventually be useful in teaching youngsters with language difficulties . It could also open a new channel of communication between man and animal . " Would n't you like to know what a chimp thinks about ? " says Georgia State University Psychologist Duane M. Rumbaugh . <P> " Perhaps one day Lana or another chimp can act as an interpreter between their world and ours . "                 @ @ @ @
