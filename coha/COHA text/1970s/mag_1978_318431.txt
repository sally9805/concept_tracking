While the Bakke decision does not specifically apply to jobs and promotions , that is perhaps the most tangled and controversial area of affirmative-action programs , and the lower courts have had a hard time dealing with the problem . <P> John F. Kennedy was the first President to call for " affirmative steps , " in Executive Order 10925 , issued in 1961 . With that measure barring job discrimination among contractors doing business with the Federal Government , Kennedy recognized that desegregation would take more than the mere absence of overt bias among contractors . So Washington told contractors on federal projects actively to recruit minorities and encourage their promotion . <P> A different , broader meaning was given to affirmative action by the historic 1964 Civil Rights Act , the first significant federal effort to outlaw employment discrimination in private industry . Title VI of this law barred discrimination in federally funded universities and other programs , and Title VII barred it in jobs . Using what courts have called color-blind language , the act made it unlawful for any employer " to fail or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discriminate ... because of such individual 's race , color , religion , sex , or national origin . " <P> The Senate sponsors of the Civil Rights Act insisted that it provided only for equal opportunity , not racial preference or balance . Said the late Senator Hubert Humphrey : " Title VII does not require an employer to achieve any sort of racial balance in his work force by giving preferential treatment to any individual or group . " Added Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr. : " An employer with only white employees could continue to have only the best-qualified persons even if they were all white . " <P> When violations of Title VII occur , federal courts are authorized to " order such affirmative action as may be appropriate , " including reinstatement of employees , and back pay . In general , the doctrine has been that judicially imposed affirmative-action remedies-including racial hiring quotas-are appropriate only when employers have been found guilty of discrimination . <P> One of the first orders requiring minority hiring goals to remedy discrimination involved the all-white Philadelphia construction trades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plan , " which provided for goals and timetables in minority recruitment in the Philadelphia building trades . The Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania sued , charging that the plan was an unconstitutional quota system and that it violated the Title VII ban on discriminatory hiring . Not so , ruled the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 1971 , upholding the President 's power to attack discrimination through use of preferential remedies . " Clearly the Philadelphia Plan is color-conscious , " wrote Judge John Gibbons , but to strike the scheme down under Title VII the court " would have to attribute to Congress the intention to freeze the status quo and to fore close remedial action to overcome existing evils .
