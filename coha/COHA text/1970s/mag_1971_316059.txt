MEASURED by the usual signs-the size of the tidal surges of money across national borders , the confusion of tourists caught with currency that no one would take , the tension at the emergency meeting of finance ministers - last week 's international monetary crisis was certainly the worst since World War II . Even so , its true gravity could not be gauged by those factors alone . Precipitated by German Economics Minister Karl Schiller in order to get European agreement on new monetary measures , the upheaval at first seemed artificial and contrived . But it quickly became a pointed revolt against the U.S. dollar , the foundation stone of the whole system of Western finance . For the first time , much of the world , in effect , was asking about the dollar the question that arrogant American tourists sometimes ask about other currencies : " How much is that worth in real money ? " <P> Quick Profit . At week 's end , a partial answer began to emerge : the dollar will be worth fewer Deutsche marks , and quite likely fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a tense , day-long meeting in Brussels on Saturday , the finance ministers of the six European Common Market nations reluctantly reached a compromise . They authorized member nations to let their currencies " float " - rise or fall in price , depending on supply and demand-within certain limits above or below their stated dollar value . It seemed almost certain that they would promptly rise . This week the West German Cabinet is expected to permit a limited floating of the mark . Belgium , The Netherlands and Austria may well follow that lead ; they trade so heavily with Germany that they can not allow the value of their moneys to get much out of line with that of the mark . <P> The European ministers minced no words in blaming the U.S. for their di lemma . Said French Finance Minister Valry Giscard d'Estaing : " Europe is having to pay for the U.S. policy of growth and full employment . " Schiller was even more direct : " The U.S. deficit of payments can no longer be tolerated with benign neglect . " <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculators to believe that Germany would soon raise the official value of the mark above its present 27.3 . Speculators immediately started selling dollars for marks , hoping to make a quick profit . Contrary to popular opinion , the speculators are not shadowy characters operating on European back streets ; most are treasurers of multinational corporations , many American . At any one time they hold huge quantities of various moneys , and they regard it as only prudent to shift funds out of a currency that looks as if it may fall in value into one that seems likely to rise . <P> Unavoidable Impact . Once the speculation began , it turned into a stampede away from the dollar , and toward not only the mark but every other strong currency in sight . Foreigners poured an unbelievable $1 billion into Germany in a single hour on Wednesday , and exchanged other giant sums of dollars for guilders , schillings and Swiss francs . Even the Japanese yen became a haven . Tokyo commercial banks holding dollars sold $340 million of them to the Bank of Japan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
