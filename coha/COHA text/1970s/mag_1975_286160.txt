One of the most worrisome threats to the budding economic recovery-and to U.S. living standards-was the sudden resurgence of double-digit inflation in June and July . Last week , though , the Labor Department had some good news for Americans . It reported that the rise in the Consumer Price Index slowed radically to an annual rate of 2.4% in August , from 15.4% the previous month . Retail food prices , which had shot up in early summer , did not rise at all in August . The purchasing power of the average worker 's paycheck was 1.1% higher than in August 1974 , marking the first time that real spendable income exceeded a year-earlier figure since February 1973 . <P> Unfortunately , the extra-slow pace of August price boosts is no more likely to continue than was the earlier super-rapid rate ; both were distorted by the erratic timing of food-price movements . Nonfood portions of the CPI are still rising at an annual rate of 6% to 7% , indicating that the underlying rate of inflation has not changed much . In September the index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August , though scarcely back to the double-digit range . At the least , though , the August figures give weight to the Ford Administration 's argument that the scary inflation pace of early summer was an aberration , and might calm nervous consumers and investors . Indeed , the stock market , after falling to 795 on the Dow Jones industrial average-close to its summer low-rallied late last week to end Friday at 830.
