As a paragon of journalistic gravitas , no newspaper can match the Sunday New York Times , all 4 lbs. , 450 pages and 500,000 words-give or take a few thousands-of it . Indeed , the city 's sanitation department once estimated it cost New York $6 million annually just to dispose of the Sunday Times poundage . For years the edition has provided a Sabbath 's activity for the city 's sedentary and a rich lode of guilt for those who know they should read all the news fit to print on any Sunday , but do n't quite succeed . Within the New York Times Co. , it was a proudly independent kingdom , with a management and staff separate from that of the daily Times . <P> Thus it was with some gravitas of his own that Sunday Editor Max Frankel last week summoned his top associates to lunch and proposed a toast : " To the Sunday department . " It was a farewell salute ; he informed them that the Sunday operation , after more than 50 years of autonomy , was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Abe " ) Rosenthal , 54 . Frankel , 46 , one of the <P> Times 's most incisive news analysts and aggressive executives , would move on to take over , beginning next year , the editorial and op-ed pages . <P> Times staffers , whose assiduity in reporting on in-house power shifts can rival that which they display on their own beats , lost no time proposing Kremlinological explanations . The first instant replay went : " Max lost , Abe won . " Relations between the two had known points of strain since Frankel moved up from Washington bureau chief three years ago to command the Sunday edition . It was said that Frankel would sometimes commission pieces for his Sunday paper after learning daily staffers were already working on the same subject . In turn , Times managing editors have itched for years to seize the Sunday department 's talent and curb its independence . But in fact the merger had been proposed a year ago by Frankel himself . <P> " Max felt he had taken the Sunday department about as far as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says one daily editor . One of Frankel 's own editors agreed that the two sides of the paper were isolated to the detriment of both , that a separate Sunday department " had all the usefulness of rumble seats . " <P> Unnecessary Work . The major factor in Publisher Arthur ( " Punch " ) Sulzberger 's break with tradition was simple editorial efficiency , and once the move was made , little defense was heard of the old duality . A year ago Sulzberger had warned the staff that the Times had " too many people doing unnecessary work . " Circulation has stagnated , and though the paper contributed 66% of the parent company 's revenues last year , it accounted for only 36% of its $12,754,000 earnings . The Times has had a freeze on hiring for two years and a hold-down for several more . Lively talent that could make the Sunday paper more of a pleasure and less of a duty to its 1.5 million buyers is in short supply .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
