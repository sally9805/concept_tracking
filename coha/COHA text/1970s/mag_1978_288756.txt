SKATEBOARD <P> Directed by George Gage Screenplay by Richard A. Wolf and George Gage <P> Skateboarding is potentially a lovely subject for a movie . All those healthy , graceful kids whirligigging around on alarming little platforms on wheels ; the opportunities for handsome photography and creative editing appear to be endless . Unfortunately , this first attempt to capitalize on a fad that has become a sport realizes almost none of that potential . <P> The blame for the failure must be equally divided between a feebly developed script and stupefying direction . The basic story is a Bad News Bears knockoff . A down-on-his-luck Hollywood talent agent ( Allen Garfield ) becomes fascinated by skateboarding kids as he commutes to and from the unemployment office . He decides to organize a team to put on exhibitions and enter the competitions that are a growing part of this phenomenon . Pressed by a gambler to pay off a debt , he unpleasantly pushes the kids , loses his star on the eve of the big down hill race but sees the substitute come from behind to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this role , but the film 's writers do not develop his relationship with his team beyond the whining and hectoring stage , and there is nothing touching or comic in their pointless dialogue . <P> The youngsters ' characters are hardly sketched in at all . A possible romance be tween Garfield and the team 's nurse-chaperone ( Kathleen Lloyd ) is also left hanging vaguely in air . The team 's adventures on the road are neither funny nor harrowing . Even the racing scenes are suspenselessly developed to resemble all the other skateboarding sequences ; no where is there any pace , style or excitement . One can only hope that this bad , visibly cheap film will not entirely preempt further explorations of a curious little world . There is still a good movie in it somewhere . <P> - Richard Schickel
