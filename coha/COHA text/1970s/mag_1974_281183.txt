The leadership of the Mormon Church is a self-perpetuating gerontocracy . By tradition , the presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , whenever there is a vacancy , falls to the senior member of the church 's governing Council of Twelve Apostles . Last week , following tradition , the council " invited , sustained and ordained " Spencer Woolley Kimball , 78 , as the church 's new president . Kimball thus became the fourth " prophet , seer and revelator " of the Mormons in as many years . President David O. McKay died in 1970 at 96 , Joseph Fielding Smith hi 1972 at 95 , and Harold B. Lee , the most recent incumbent and longtime guiding administrative genius of the church , just two weeks ago at 74 . <P> The apparent smoothness of the latest succession was deceptive . In 1972 Spencer Kimball had open-heart surgery ; 15 years before that an operation for throat cancer left him with only a part of a vocal cord . Although he arrived at the decisive meeting of the twelve with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many Mormons were naturally concerned about Kimball 's longevity . Some even would have liked to use his health as an excuse to change the line of succession . The real reason : their fear of the accession to the presidency of Ezra Taft Benson , 74 , when Kimball dies . <P> Senior Apostle . Eisenhower 's former Secretary of Agriculture , who is now senior apostle and head of the council , has flustered many Mormons with his abrasive public utterances , some of them to John Birch Society audiences . His benediction at the funeral of President McKay was so heavy with right-wing political overtones as to embarrass even the conservative Mormon hierarchy . Now the divisive Benson is next in the wings , as amiable President Kimball begins his regime . <P> Kimball 's paternal grandfather was one of the original Mormon Twelve Apostles under Joseph Smith . His maternal grandfather was Brigham Young 's business manager . His father was a Mormon bishop . The sixth of eleven children , Kimball grew up to become , like so many other Mormon leaders , a successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> He has also paid his dues in church work . Since 1965 he has chaired the church 's missionary executive committee , while its corps of missionaries grew from 12,600 to some 18,000 . Mostly young Mormons who serve two years as missionaries at their own expense , the persistent evangelists made 78,000 converts in 1972 , helping to raise the number of Mormons worldwide to an estimated 3,300,000 . Mission work , says Kimball , is " a great character builder . " <P> <P> Kimball takes an equally pragmatic view of other Mormon practices . One remarkable doctrine , for instance , holds that the dead as well as the living can be offered baptism as Mormons . This sends troops of elderly members to the church 's temples to enroll ancestors . <P> Kimball sees the work as a sort of spiritual WPA-a task that keeps older Mormons both busy and feeling needed .
