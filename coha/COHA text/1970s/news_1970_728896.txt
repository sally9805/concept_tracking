txt Vice President Agnew , appealing to " the workingmen of the country " to give President Nixon a Republican Congress , lashed out today at the Democrats as " radical liberals . " After conferring with the President , he left Washington this morning for a six-state political swing west . Mr. Agnew told two dozen reporters accompanying him that the " primary issue " in the 1970 campaign would be " whether the policies of the United States are going to be made by its elected officials or in the streets . " In a speech on the Statehouse steps in Springfield , Ill. , which served as a ' campaign keynote , he accused Congressional Democrats of blocking Administration ? initiatives toward peace ' in Southeast Asia , adopting a " ho-hum , businessas-usual attitude " toward ef // forts to reduce crime and pornography , and continuing economic policies that he said threatened the income and savinas of all Americans . ' In his Springfield speech and I later at a rally on the fairgrounds here , the Vice President outlined in blistering language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told about 4,000 cheering partisans and a handful of demonstrators in Springfield that President Nixon 's efforts were being hampered by Democratic . , ' ultra-liberalism " that , he said , " translates into a whimpering isolationism in foreign policy , a mulish obstructionism in domestic policy and a pusillanimous pussyfooting on the critical issue of law and order . " Standing tonight in front of a huge American flag , the Vice President charged that the Democrats were  --  frantically attempting to shift from the left back forward the center of the political spectrum . He said that a " notorious Senate dove " ? identified by Agnew aides as Senator Albert Gore , Democrat of Tennessee ? had deserted allies to help defeat the - Hatfield amendment which set a date , for a withdrawal of all American troops from Vietnam . All of a sudden , he continued , Lawrence F. O'Brien , the Democratic National Chairman ; denounced today in Chicago " extreme and irresponsible statements " by fellow Democrats . Mr , Agnew said it was a sign that Mr. O'Brien had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albatross . " The 2,500 people in his Casper audience cheered as the Vice President saidt " These men , ? these sheep in wolves ' clothing , , are trying to pull the fastest switcheroo in American politics . But I intend to blow the whistle on them from Maine to California , and they 're not going to get away with it . " Appeal to Workers Mr. Agnew , salting his comments with words such as " troglodytic " ( cave dwelling ) and inventing the phrase " radic-libs " to describe the opposition , clearly pinned White House hopes for control of the Senate on an appeal to bluecollar workers to abandon the Democratic party . He said that the political liberalism of Presidents Roosevelt , Truman and Kennedy had been transformed by its Democratic inheritors into a " far left " philosophy . " We believe in representing the poor too , " he told the Springfield crowd , " and we do . But the time has come for someone also to represent workingmen of this country , the forgotten men of American politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. Smith of Illinois , a Republican serving his first term , and lumping his Democratic opponent , State Treasurer Acilai E. Stevenson 3d , among the " radic-libs , " the Vice President said that the American workingman had been " rejected and written off by the , old f:lite " but would become " the cornerstone of the New Majority . " " We are also asking in the election the support of ? the working women of America , " he added , " whether they labor in home , factory , or office  --  or just breach the ramparts at 's bar in New York . " " There is a new deadlock of democracy today , " Mr. Agnew , said " between a progressive President , carrying out his mandate for reform , and a reactionary Congress in the grip of bitter men who forfeited that mandate . " Campaign Objective The objective of the 1970 campaign , he said , " is not simply to win or to hold offices : It is to give America a new leadership , a leadership of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who moan endlessly about what is wrong with their country with men and women of the wit and will to stand up and speak out for what is right about America . ' The Vice President put that theme on a personal level as well . He said that as he stood on a platform beneath the statehouse windows of Mr. Stevenson 's office , that Senator Smith 's opponent " has no business in the United States Senate " because of Mr. Stevenson 's criticism in 1968 of the Chicago police 's treatment of demonstrators at the Democratic National Convention . " Any individual who , in these times , will slander the men of the Chicago police force by calling them ' storm troopers in blue , ' ought to be retired from public life , " said the Vice President , recalling a phrase used by Mr. Stevenson . In Casper , where a Republican Representative , John S. Wold , is challenging Democratic Senator Gale W. , Mr. Agnew was less harsh with the Senator , who has supported the Administration 's Vietnam policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a defeat for those trying to curtail inflation and would " help leave in the positions of power in the Senate the same radical liberals who control that body today . " During his first day of Congressional campaigning , the Vice President sought to turn the economic issue , which the Democrats consider their strongest , into an asset . He said the inflation that Mr. Nixon is seeking to curtail was the fault of Democratic Administrations and warned : " If this Congress is turned just 10 more degrees toward the radical Left , then the President 's efforts to protect your income and savings ' will be overriden , and the country will go of on another spending spree like the last one . " Democrats have made careers , Mr. Agnew said in Casper , " of professing their heartfelt concern for the very poor and the elderly in our society . I know of nothing more cynical , more cruel , in American politics . It is always the poor and the elderly who. suffer most in the kind of inflation generated the recent past . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the , law-and-order issue . He said that the Administration 's proposal to crack down on organized crime , drug merchants and pornographers had been " languishing in the Congress . " " How many children , my friends , must we pick . out of the gutters and alleys of our great cities , dead of overdoses of heroin , before Congress finally , decides that maybe it 's time to act ? he asked . He received loud applause in Springfield with another rhetorical question : " How do you fathom the thinking of these radical-liberals who work themselves into a lather over an alleged shortage of nutriments in a child 's box of Wheaties  --  but who can not get exercised at all over the same child 's constant exposure to a flood of hard-core pornography that could warp his moral outlook for a lifetime ? " During his Illinois appearance , a small group of antiwar demonstrators occasionally shouted , " End that damn war , " but were drowned out for the most part by the public address system . One dissident held up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric . " The Vice President acknowledged that his language was stern , and he said ? that the " liberal Eastern press ? the organ grinders of the old elite " no doubt would criticize him on the editorial pages . " Do n't let this bother you , " he said to cheers and applause , " as assuredly , it does not bother me . ? The Vice President traveled aboard a chartered 727 jet with his wife , Judy , his ? younger daughter , Kim , and a cadre of the President 's political advisers that included two speechwriters , Patrick J. Buchanan and William L. Safire . Asked whether he agreed with Lawrence F. O'Brien , the Democratic national chairman , that the White House campaigners should go off the public payroll , Mr. Agnew replied : " I do n't think I have to back up to ' the pay window .
