It was no ordinary group of Americans . There were 238 of them , and since most were from Texas , they had not come to Spain for the sun . Missionaries all , they were Southern Baptist laymen-farmers , mail carriers and bankers . Their task : to help the struggling Spanish Baptists stage an evangelistic crusade . " The Bible was a story of people who walked in faith in a hostile land , " declared Dallas Cattleman L.S. Rowland in a stem-winding oration , translated from roughhewn English to smooth Spanish by another missionary . " The truth is that we may move all of Spain ! " <P> From the days of the Council of Trent , Protestantism has been virtually an underground movement in Spain . Baptist missionaries from Sweden and the U.S. began work there in 1870 under a short-lived religious-freedom law , but later on the small churches were often shut down . Only since a new law was passed in 1967 have the 10,000 Baptists and other non-Catholics been able to hold public meetings . But the specially warm welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strained relations between the government and the Catholic Church , which outdid each other in greeting the visitors . Both the mayor and the acting bishop of Madrid sent emissaries to the Baptists ' opening meeting in the Melia Castilla Hotel . In return , the prelate was given a Bible and the mayor a cowboy hat , L.B.J.-style . <P> Bilingual Buttonholing . The next day the Americans fanned out to assignments in 17 cities . In Alicante , 21 of them were greeted by a band , a crowd of 500 and the local Baptist pastor , a convert from Catholicism , who remembered clearly the bitterness of discrimination against Protestants . Said he : " I have not been so nervous since my wedding day . " In every city , the meetings drew hundreds of curious Spaniards . The Americans also tried some door-to-door buttonholing , aided by bilingual dictionaries . In Lerida , the local radio broadcast spot commercials for the crusade 14 times daily , and in Cordova , the Baptists handed out 5,000 tracts in one day . <P> While they were joined together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionaries were also learning something about each other . The Spaniards were bewildered at first by the sobbing , arm-flailing exhortations imported from Dixie . For their part , the Texans were embarrassed by the thimble-size glasses of wine passed out during the Spanish Baptists ' Holy Supper . Teetotalers , they take grape juice . <P> On the whole , the crusade proceeded smoothly . Last week , at the end of the eight-day campaign , the Baptists could claim about 300 Spanish souls , including that of Feli Martinez , a nun who immediately applied for her passport to the U.S. Later , she says , she will return to Spain as a Baptist missionary .
