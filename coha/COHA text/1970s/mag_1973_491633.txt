Last spring , Dick Van Dyke was chosen to serve on the Carefree ( Arizona ) Search and Rescue Team  --  a group of local citizens organized to succor unwary tourists who wander into the desert and ca n't find their way out . Dick did n't take the appointment lightly . He decided his credentials were uncertain enough that a few dry runs would be in order . Accordingly , one workday morning , instead of pointing his dune buggy down the highway that leads to the studio where he films his television show , he took off across the desert  --  and instantly got lost . Nine hours , several search helicopters , and a number of hastily organized rescue teams later , Dick found his own way out of the desert to a road that led him back to civilization . His TV associates had been sweating him out all day . Astudio audience of 300 people  --  some of whom had waited months for tickets  --  sat patiently for several hours and was finally sent home . When Dick appeared at the studio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those search parties did n't even come close , " he said . " Let me tell you , I was scared . " Scared or not , Dick Van Dyke would still rather take his chances in the Arizona desert than the Hollywood jungle . He made that clear three years ago when he bought a ranch forty miles out of Phoenix , packed up his family , and moved away  --  from a life , and apparently a career as well , that had made him a byword in millions of American homes . 1 saw him in his new habitat a few months ago , shortly after Dick had completed a season of TV filming . Ile put off his daily hike in the desert and his digging for Indian artifacts to meet me about five miles from his home  --  at a watering place for the wealthy , called the Carefree Inn . He swung out of his dune buggy in front of the hotel precisely on schedule , moving with the fluid grace of the professional dancer . The hotel employees who had been referring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " Mr. Van Dyke . " He 's slim and hard and tanned and taller than I expected , and the only concessions to middle age are the streaks of grey that furrow his brownish hair . The first impression of him is the near-total lack of either pretense or guile . Nothing happened in the subsequent hours to change that feeling . He is affable , open and friendly ; he is not exuberant , effusive or impulsive  --  nor is he given to one-line jokes or funny sayings . Mary Tyler Moore , his first TV " wife , " calls him a " loving human being who reaches out to people . " The description is apt . Yet , like most good comedic actors in visceral touch with human frailties , Dick Van Dyke is basically a very serious guy  --  but in a lighthearted kind of way that puts his listener off at first , until the realization finally comes that this man has deep inner resources capable of producing unexpected profundities . And he is also a little wary , sharing himself in escalating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never departs completely . There is always a piece of Dick Van Dyke in reserve  - -  how large , probably even he does n't know . There is also one inflexible physical restriction . The Van Dykes have an ironclad rule against conducting Dick 's business at home . He simply does n't do it . Ever . So we started over coffee in a hotel room and later explored Dick 's beloved countryside as he simply poured forth several tons of the restless energy he devotes to whatever project is at hand . He began  --  because it was uppermost in his thought that day ? by retracing for me the agonies of creating and casting a new television series , something he thought he 'd put behind him for good three years earlier . It did n't turn out that way  --  primarily because Dick discovered , after his move to the desert , that a $2.5-million film studio had just been built near his home to try to attract motion picture projects to the Phoenix area . " The studio was a trap , " Dick told me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CBS had been putting constant pressure on me to come up with another series , and when I saw that brave statements as Byron Paul saying : " We have absolute concentration here . We 're not meeting all our friends and agents on the way home from work and getting their opinions . If any brass wants to put any pressure on us , they have to come here . " And Van Dyke adding : " I never thought lightning could strike twice , but it 's happened . And this time we 're doing themes that would have been impossible on the old show . Nobody 's going to outguess this one . " For awhile , the statistics supported the optimism . In its first season , the new show rated consistently in the top fifteen , but this season , says Dick . " we 're in the basement . They moved us to Sunday and threw us to the wolves . We 're up against big blockbuster movies , and we do n't have a chance . " But Dick 's honesty wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduling . " The show just is n't that good , " he admits sadly . " It is n't anywhere near what it ought to be . No one 's character has ever been sufficiently defined so it is consistent from week to week . Sketch comedy must have an underlying basis of reality , and 1 never won that argument with our writers  --  that this show is funny but it is n't real . No one , including me , has ever believed the relationships , the marriage , the involvements . There are moments I 'm really proud of , but on the whole , our shows have n't been cohesive . " At this writing , Van Dyke does n't know if he will be back next year . But he does know that a lot of the writers , directors and performers who could provide the adrenalin the show needs  --  particularly Carl Reiner  --  do n't share Dick 's passion for Arizona , and the geography of the show defeats them . ( A complete technical crew is flown out weekly from Hollywood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast members  --  except Dick 's current co-star , Hope Lange , who still is n't that enchanted with the desert  --  have moved to Arizona . ) " I 'm in a bad position , " says Dick . " If I 'm renewed , I can either stick by my guns and live and work here and do another second-rate show , Or I can commute to Los Angeles and get the kind of help I need . I 've got that choice to make , and my wife and I have been talking about it pretty seriously . I do n't want to commute seven months of the year , but for my own professional pride and emotional well-being , I 've got to do this show right at least one season . And my wife is behind me because she 's seen me agonize over the show through the two years we 've worked out here . " Whatever happens next year . Dick says he wo n't go beyond a third season , which is the extent of his current contract with CBS-TV . His head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest him ; in studying the remnants of Indian cultures on his land , and especially in exploring inside himself and following some of the unexpected routes he turns up there . Nearing fifty , Dick says he is " more comfortable with myself . with my wife and family and with my life than I 've ever been . The compulsions that drove me crazy when I was younger have ceased to be a problem . There 's a mellowness that comes with middle age that I really like . I 'm able to think more clearly than I used to . I 'm not in emotional heat about anything . It 's a great time of life , and I do n't think I 'd be twenty-one again for anything . There was a lot of internal suffering then . To live through it once is wonderful  --  but once is enough . " Few of the millions of people who have admired and laughed with Dick Van Dyke as a performer have been aware of the internal struggles , the " emotional heat " of the years when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount soap boxes , " says Mary Tyler Moore . " He just works diligently and privately for what he believes in . In the years we worked together , Dick never lost his temper except when someone else was being treated unfairly . People who opposed the Fair Housing initiative in California upset him , for example , and I think the angriest I 've ever seen him was at a football coach who told his son one day to go out and kill the other team . Dick was outraged . " Most of Dick 's stresses grew out of latent conflicts with his own roots , with the feelings and convictions and perspectives that were programmed into him during his childhood and adolescence in Danville . Illinois . lie understands the psyche of middle America because he was immersed in it for almost twenty-five years . During those years , he was involved in every school and community theatrical production Danville offered , and when he joined the Air Force in the middle of World War II , this experience helped him become an announcer on the USAF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack to Danville after the war to start an advertising agency and to woo his high school sweetheart . Marjorie Willett . The romance prospered , but not the ad agency , and Dick left Danville for good as half of a nightclub pantomime act called the Merry Mutes . Marge remained in the Midwest while Dick sought desperately for some means of accumulating enough money to get married . He found it in a Los Angeles hotel where he was performing . A radio program called " Bride and Groom " originated there , and Dick convinced the people who ran it that he and Marge would be ideal for their show . " They gave us a two-week honeymoon , the rings , the whole works , " Dick recalls . " We could n't have afforded it for a couple of years any other way . " The ceremony took place in a chapel on the hotel grounds , and when the chapel was torn down a few years ago , Marge heard about it and bought the chapel doors and the altar cloth . The doors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Dick and Marge will celebrate their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary next February . ( Says Mary Tyler Moore : " I 've never seen anyone more totally in love . " She remembered Dick coming to work one day exhausted because he and Marge had been up talking most of the night . " Any two people , " says Miss Moore , " who after that many years of marriage can enjoy each other 's talk until 4 a.m. , have something very special going . " ) After Dick and his nightclub partner ( who is still a close friend ) split in 1953 , Dick spent three years in Atlanta and New Orleans as the moderator for several TV talk shows before Byron Paul , an old Air Force friend , set up an audition for him at CBS-TV in New York . Dick learned his trade quickly and well , filling in for Jack Paar and Garry Moore , then doing guest spots as a stand-up comic , and finally starring in a TV special called " The Fabulous Fifties " that won him the lead on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hollywood to do the mot ion picture version of Birdie , then joined Carl Reiner and Mary Tyler Moore to create one of the most successful comedy series in TV history . It ran five years . won Dick three Emmy awards , and went off the air at the peak of its popularity because , says Dick , " the juices just ran out . " Mary Tyler Moore remembers that " we all really wanted it to end . We were young and flushed with success and wanted to try our wings at other interests . " To Dick , the " other interests " were his family and a career in motion pictures that would offer him some freedom and change of pace from the rigid demands of the weekly TV series . The Van Dykes have four children . The oldest , Christian , was married two years ago and attends law school in Phoenix . ( " He 's tremen dously idealistic , " says Dick , " wanted to be a minister , then switched to law as another way to work for social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's show as a production assistant and wants to act . So does eighteen-year-old Stacy , who played leads in all her high school // musicals , attended a performing arts school for a few weeks , left it in disgust over the drug scene , and is now looking for a job teaching preschool children while she plots her own future . ( " She 's strongly opinionated , " says Dick , " and terribly concerned about making her life mean something . She 's so determined to do it on her own that I would n't be surprised if she changes her name so she 's sure she is n't trading on mine . " ) And , finally , there is elevenyear-old Carrie Beth , who appears occasionally on the TV show , spends three hours a day at the piano , and is convinced that horses are more interesting than people . While the members of his family shaped their own interests and identities , Dick was offered dozens of movie scripts-most of them bad . A handful , notably Mary Poppins . Divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One , The Comic , was well received critically but a financial disaster . ( Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , which Dick hated , was the other way around . ) And most of the rest-such instantly forgettable films as Some Kind of Nut and Lt. Robinson Crusoe-were disasters by any standard . Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was made in England , and if nothing else , it provided the Van Dykes with two of their closest friends , actress Patricia Neal and her writer husband , Roald Dahl . It also increased Dick 's restlessness with his professional future and his desire to get away from the Hollywood scene . Marge had actively disliked Hollywood for a long time , and Dick tolerated it because it was part of the work he had chosen to do . Finally , the pressures on them both to reorder their lives became almost overwhelming , manifesting themselves in some uncomfortable ways . One was excessive drinking . " The most dangerous drug we have in this country , " says Dick , " is not heroin or speed or LSD . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . You wo n't find it listed under cherry pop ; you 'll find it under drugs . It 's twice as addictive as any other drug , is taken by four times as many people , causes more accidents and is more debilitating . This is a drinking culture we live in ; but it 's funny that nobody thinks of it as a major problem-because it is n't publicized on the front pages , and because it 's legal . " I 've looked into these things because I used to drink a lot . I was proud of the fact that I could hold my liquor pretty well , and I think both Marge and I were on the verge of going into heavier , compulsive drinking where it becomes a necessity rather than a form of relaxation , and we got worried . " ( A close friend remembers that " Dick could drinkenormous quantities , but I never saw him out of control or even with slurred speech . He just had a larger tolerance for it than the rest of us . " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and talked to some people in Alcoholics Anonymous , and what I learned squared with what was happening to me . I was losing energy and concentration and a sense of wellbeing . I blamed it on getting older , but I finally realized that it was drinking . So I just quit . Completely . I do n't drink a beer or a glass of wine or anything . I had a kind of - withdrawal period where it was hard to get to sleep at night , but the difference was startling . Now I 'm going to work on cigarettes . " These are the superficial aspects of a typical Van Dyke search " to find out where I am , where I belong . . and where do I go from here ? " Dick spends many introspective hours probing the bounds of his philosophical convictions , and often this takes him into deep waters . He can come up with observations on his version of Man 's fate which tend to startle some of his more conventional friends , and these viewpoints tend to further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an isolation which has its roots in the fact that these two are tremendously private people anyway . During their years in Hollywood , Marge could protect her privacy by withdrawing to her own world of family and close friends and intellectual and emotional interests . This was much more difficult for Dick , who had to expose himself socially as well as professionally . During the early years of the first television series , there were some painful evenings when Marge would have to accompany Dick to Hollywood parties she loathed and would wander the fringes of groups clustering about her husband . " The network got a press agent for us , " recalls Dick , " and we had to go two or three nights a week to parties , to filmings , to previews . My wife almost left me ; she clams up in situations like that , and few people ever really had a chance to know Marge . I saw this happening , and it killed me We did that for two years , dreading it , and finally I went alone-only to things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick won his last Emmy award , he and Marge were in a camper in the mountains , many hours from Los Angeles . " We 'd just put out the campfire. " recalls Dick , " and I had turned on the radio to get the I o'clock news and found that I 'd won . I 'm not knocking the Emmys . It was a great thrill . But I 'd been there twice before , and that was enough . " The Van Dykes are not recluses . They have close friends both in Arizona and Hollywood - some in Continued on page 116 continued from page 115 the entertainment business , some not . But they wanted from the beginning to control their own social life , to pick their own friends , and to spend all the time they felt was needed with their growing family . And to think on things important to them both . It 's hardly surprising that Dick came to dislike Hollywood and the demands , professional and social , that it made on him . ( " Just fighting the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work for me . And I was also very sensitive to the smog . " ) So the Van Dykes fled the Hollywood environment whenever they could- and more and more , their attention concentrated on the desert . They had been entranced by the Mojave when they first crossed it , driving to California from Danville in 1947 . During the Hollywood years , they would often rent a camper and spend long weekends there . " 1 have a feeling , " said Dick , " that Middlewesterners who have looked at cornfields all their lives are especially caught up by the mystery and beauty of the desert . It constantly grew on me-and it hit my wife the same way . " Three years ago the Van Dykes decided to move to the desert . Dick and Marge went ranch hunting and were about to return to Los Angeles after an unsuccessful weekend , when the real estate salesman in despera tion-showed them an abandoned property at the end of the last rutted track off the last graveled road in the desert north of Phoenix . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked longingly in all the windows and talked about it alt the way home . And the next day , they called up and bought it . The ranch-named " Sitio con Dios " ( A Godly Place ) - is 180 acres of mesquite , sand and buried Indian relics . It lies just outside Cave Creek , a tiny , seedy , dusty village where Dick can drive his dune buggy to pick up a tool at the Hi-way Variety and Hardware or shoot the breeze at the Cave Creek saloon . He 's part of the community , now , and is accepted that way . Dick made the graduation speech at Carrie Beth 's grammar school last spring , and he 's narrated the Christmas pageant and worked with high school kids in the area on musical plays-and says he loves it . For their part , the townspeople are fiercely protective of him . Tourists will have a tough time finding the Van Dyke ranch to gawk at . ( When Dick 's mother came to visit , she could n't find anyone in Cave Creek who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Dick took me there only after a good deal of hesitation . " It 's okay , " he said finally , " as long as my wife does n't see us . She 's death on that . She says , ' Do your career , but please keep it off the ranch . ' And I do n't blame her after the experience we had in Hollywood . We came out here so we could order our own lives , and we do n't plan to mix my work with our other life . " There are two main buildings on the property : an oversized bunkhouse where Dick 's oldest son and his wife live , and the Van Dyke home nearby-a sprawling ranch house surrounded by a " snake wall " and faced with an expanse of glass that commands a panoramic view of absolutely unspoiled desert . Dick talks about the ranch with the same affectionate tone he uses for his family . " That rise up there , " he says , gesturing toward a sandy mount silhouetted in the dusk , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a Hohokam Indian stone axe there last summer , and her parents have been excavating hopefully ever since . ) The first night the Van Dykes were in their new house , they set out dog food for the coyotes , and now they come when Dick whistles . There are cows and horses and rabbits and dogs and rattlesnakes-the Van Dykes killed twenty-nine on their property last summer-and not very many neighbors . " But , " says Dick , " we did n't come out here to get away from people . We came out because we love the desert . Marge and I always planned to retire here . We just speeded it up a little , that 's all . " Dick has never regretted his own social and political activism and has no intention of turning his back on it now , nor does he think other show business people should . " If I have a moral commitment , " he says , " that has to come before my career if I 'm going to have any respect for myself . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be a propaganda platform . Ile 's had some arguments with his writers on this point . Early this year , he did an episode where a young boy finds some unsmoked marijuana at school and brings it home , where his grandmother-mistaking it for a pack of her cigarettes- smokes it and is arrested . The writers wanted Dick , in his character as a TV talk show moderator , to deliver a strong message against present marijuana laws . He refused . " I did n't want the show to take a stand , " he told me . " We worked it out so you heard both sides of the story , and finally got what I thought was a funny show about pot without turning anybody off . I do n't mind suggesting a point of view , but I hate a tract . That 's not the function of a comedy show . " He is equally concerned about misusing his pipeline to the public to commercialize on what he considers had taste . " I play to public taste as far as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things I wo n't do , whether or not the public wants them . I hate bad taste of any kind , but I also feel that creative people should be able to say what they want to say-and hope that they exercise some responsibility . " Nobody has a 360-degree perspective on morality , and I do n't know any way to legislate good taste . It 's such an individual thing . But I do know that some show business people have fallen into the danger of saying , ' I have open-line communication with the public , and it 's my responsibility to use it and get through to these people . ' What the public depends on us for is entertainment ; when we break that promise to them , we lose them altogether and no longer have any line of communication . " Back in the Hollywood days . Dick 's private line of communication was rooted in his own unchallenged inner convictions . Every few weeks , he would have several dozen troubled young people- chosen by the Big Brother organization and church and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would urge them to embrace Christ in their daily lives , and they would Listen . His coworkers remember him writing those speeches between scenes of his TV show . Now he is questioning more critically ; his thinking is less dogmatic and his explorations more complex . But he 's finding the search exciting . " Dick 's happier now , " says Carl Reiner , " because no one is pulling at him . " But if the inner man is searching more deeply , the outer man-as attested by virtually everyone who comes in contact with him professionally or personally -- has remained unchanged . Mary Tyler Moore perhaps said it best . " Dick is anything good and positive you can say about a human being , " she told me earnest - ly . " He is probably the fairest , kind - est , most giving person I 've ever known . Working with him was a lesson in how to live your own life . " IT                  @ @ @
