It has always been a threat as well as a promise . It entices the winter-weary by flaunting balmy temperatures , azure skies and buds bursting into blazing color . Children break out their bicycles , college students recline and pretend to study on the mall , and Americans of all ages tilt pale faces to catch the first warming rays of the sun . <P> But just as surely as it woos them , spring rebuffs its admirers , slapping them with stinging hail , destructive tornadoes and rapacious rivers . After the worst winter on record , spring 's capriciousness last week was especially cruel , endurable in some areas only because of the certainty that better days were just ahead . <P> April turned savage in Georgia , hurling a Southern Airways DC-9 to the ground under a barrage of hail , and killing 70 people . In Alabama , where twisting tornadoes leveled a middle-class suburb of Birmingham , 20 died . <P> Heavy rains in the Appalachian hill country of eastern Kentucky , Tennessee , West Virginia and Virginia sent some rivers rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Sandy , Cumberland and Kentucky gushed over their banks in Kentucky ( a national guardsman described " a big whooshing noise " ) , five people were swept to their deaths and 7,600 families fled . When they returned , their homes were gone , or wrecked by water and mud . <P> Near Pikeville , a small coal center along the Big Sandy , people endured the rain and the resulting flood . Then a fire , touched off by leaking gasoline , destroyed the town library , a telephone-company building and a house . Finally , it snowed . In aptly named Hazard , Ky. , Charlie Hammonds , a gas-station operator , managed to take calamity in stride . His reason : " This is the 26th time I 've been flooded since I came here in 1957 . " At Jack 's Union 76 Service Station near Sneedville , Tenn. ( pop . 1,000 ) . Owner Jack Stapleton even found cause for cheer , though the Clinch River had risen a record 26 ft. above its banks , sweeping away houses and barns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nobody got killed or hurt bad . The sun is shining , and the birds are singing . " <P> Spring was still silent in parts of New England and the Midwest , beset by low temperatures and snow . In the tiny hamlet of Sears Pond , near Watertown in northern New York , an incredible 42 in. of snow remained on the ground , but no wonder , since residents there were claiming they had measured an alltime record winter snowfall for an area east of the Rockies : 450 in . Let out of their stalls for the first time in months , local cows kicked up their heels like horses . <P> Come what might-or May-much of the nation was caught up in the spirit of renewal . When the wet season in Northern California turned up bone dry , about 2,000 San Franciscans , a few dressed in foul-weather gear , staged a modern rain dance in the Hyatt Regency hotel . They foxtrotted to Raindrops Keep Fallin ' on My Head , April Showers and Stormy Weather . The dance was not dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
