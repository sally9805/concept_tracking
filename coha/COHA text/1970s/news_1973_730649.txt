txt FINANCE ministers from West Germany , Britain , and France held an urgent dinner meeting yesterday in Paris in an attempt to formulate plans for handling the growing world monetary crisis . Germany 's Helmut Schmidt was dispatched from Bonn by Chancellor Willy Brandt and met with Britain 's Anthony Barber and France 's Valery Giscard d'Estaing . A Bonn government spokesman said the meeting was held to " work out a common European position " concerning the eight-dayold United States dollar crisis . When the meeting ended , the three officials posed for photographers but did not reveal the substance of their discussion . No further meetings were scheduled . IN BONN , an official source said Schmidt would return to the West German capital to report to Chancellor Willy Brandt today . A British Embassy spokesman said Barber flew back to London immediately after the meeting . Dollars poured into German and other world money markets yesterday as speculators tried to unload the U. S. currency . Chancellor Willy Brandt earlier talked by telephone with President Nix on , President Georges Pompidou of France and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Bank bought furiously to soak up the dollars and prevent a de facto dollar devaluation . THE DOLLAR crashed in an avalanche of selling in Frankfurt , Tokyo , Amsterdam , and elsewhere . Japan 's Ministry of Finance announced this morning that it had closed the Tokyo foreign exchange market . In a terse statement shortly before the market was scheduled to open for a half-day of trading , the ministry gave no reason for its action . The action was clearly based on the speculation against the dollar in West Germany and particularly the heavy trading yesterday . TODAY 'S MOVE by Japan represented a quick shift in policy . Earlier , officials had let it be known that Japan planned M follow the West German lead in tactics to defend the yen against a speculative attack . The Japanese Bank yesterday was forced to buy $220 million to support the existing dollar-yen fate ? more than double Thursday 's $105-million support buying . The dollar also weakened in London , where the pound is floating  --  free to rise or fall without any Bank of England intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank was forced to buy $167 million  --  the biggest amount so far this week in Holland ? when the dollar hit the official rate of 3.1720 guilders . SPECULATORS also forced the dollar to the floor in Belgium , Sweden , Denmark , and Norway , and central banks in those countries , too , had to support U. In West Germany , the central bank , supporting Bonn 's refusal to let the dollar fall to a lower level that would help U.S. exports , had to swallow $1.8 billion in support buying . But despite the buying the dollar closed at 3.1480 marks , below the agreed 3.1500 floor . Bonn insisted publicly it will not revalue or float its mark upward , or adopt a compromise " two-tier " market for a partial float . Speculators nevertheless , feared the weekend could bring anything from a Germanor Japanese revaluation to a U. S. dollar devaluation or import surcharge . Dealers said the immediate cause of the dollar 's Black Friday was speculation that the 1971 Smithsonian agreement ? hailed by Nixon as " the most significant monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually dead . That ' agreement came after a similar 1971 dollar crisis that ended in new exhange rates attempting to restore stability by devaluing the dollar and revaluing upward the German mark , the Japanese yen and other currencies .
