txt On Memorial Day weekend , says a U.S. Government official , " there is a good possibility " that Americans will burn up more gasoline per day than ever before . Already , said a Federal Energy Administration ( FEA ) official , U.S. motorists are consuming 7.21 million barrels of gasoline a day ? just under an all-time high of 7.26 million barrels recorded in August , 1973 , before the Arab oil embargo plunged the nation into shortage . Prices at the pump are due to rise ? how much is disputed . Frank G. Zarb , Federal Energy Administrator , says the price rise this summer should be no more than two or three cents a gallon . Much depends on supply , with experts agreeing that only increased imports of foreign oil can satisfy the thirst of Americans to run their cars at a record pace this summer . // *Motorists face higher prices // Imports will continue to climb , experts agree . Domestic U.S. oil production is shrinking at - the same time consumption is growing . Rather than cut back consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil . " Since March . " says Bruce Chalfant , managing editor of Platt 's Oilgram in New York , " there has been a continuous drop in primary and secondary storage of gasoline . " Each week , Mr. Chalfant says , storage of gasoline at refineries and bulk plants is shrinking by 2.5 million to 4 million barrels . The price of gasoline now is about 4 cents a gallon cheaper than it was last summer . But prices are creeping up again , as consumption gallops ahead and supplies tighten . Whether summer price hikes are held to the 2 or 3 cents a gallon forecast by Mr. Zarb , experts say , may depend on how much foreign oil must be brought in to satisfy demand . " This bicentennial year , " said an FEA official " is a different ball game . It is hard to predict how much Americans are going to drive . " With Americans flocking to buy big cars and with'the nationwide 55-mile an hour speed limit widely ignored , consumption of gasoline is running 8 to 10 percent ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) meets in Indonesia Thursday ( May 27 ) to decide whether to raise world oil prices July 1 . Last September OPEC increased prices 10 percent , to $11.51 for a barrel of Saudi Arabian light crude , the benchmark against which other countries ' crudes are measured . Iran , whose ambitious spending programs outstrip its revenue from oil , wants to boost the price . Saudi Arabia hopes to avoid a price increase . Some analysts believe a hike of about 5 percent may result . FEA officials say supplies of gasoline this summer " should be adequate " to meet a 7 to 8 percent increase in demand  --  but only if " almost immediately " imports of refined gasoline are increased by about 500,000 barrels daily . Already , the United States imports more than 40 percent of its oil requirements , up from 35 percent in 1973 . The United States , reports the FEA , now spends $125 per person for imported oil , against $15 a person in 1970 . Many gasoline retailers , because of local competitive conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markup allowed by FEA regilations . If supplies now tighten , and drivers clamor for gasoline , some dealers may push up prices by as much as six cents a gallon , according to an industry source . Americans in various parts of the country , the source added , may find their gasoline prices rising anywhere from one to six cents , depending on local conditions . " Consumption of gasoline , " said an FEA official , " in the first three months of this year was about 6 percent higher than a year ago . In April it was 7 percent higher and now demand is running at least 8 percent over a year ago . " Clearly , analysts agree , pleas by government officials for Americans to save gasoline  --  and to obey the 55-mile an hour speed limit  --  are having little effect as the Bicentennial summer rolls into high gear .
