txt A barefoot man grabbed a Port Authority patrolman 's revolver near the Greyhound ticket counter of the midtown bus terminal during the morning rush hour yesterday , killed the officer and , in a wild burst of gunfire that sent commuters scurrying for cover , seriously wounded two bystanders . The incident , which the police said had begun as a routine arrest of " one of the many derelicts who come in off the street , " ended when the barefoot man was shot twice and killed as he ran toward the Ninth Avenue side of the terminal . With pandemonium filling the huge ' terminal as shots and screams echoed , arriving passengers were ordered back into buses and the drivers , not knowing the cause of the confusion , quickly drove outside the terminal . The dead officer was Henry J. Koebel Jr. , 27 years old , of Fords , N.J. His wife , mother and sister also work for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . He had been shot once in the chest and twice in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body up from the floor in front of the Greyhound counter and rushed him by car to Roosevelt Hospital . At 8:35 A.M. , nearly 20 minutes after he was brought into the hospital 's emergency room , Officer Koebel was pronounced dead . The gunman , 25 - year - old Nemiah Huger , died on the floor of the terminal , where he was cut down by Officer Wayne R. Kontje of the Port Authority police . Thomas Langam , a middle-aged commuter from Old Bridge , NJ. , who had just arrived in the terminal on the way // to his office in midtown , was shot in the lower leg and the forearm . He was taken to St. Clare 's Hospital , where he was reported in stable condition . Fifty-year-old Emma Rachko of 233d Street in the Bronx was , Port Authority officials believe , waiting in line at the Greyhound ticket counter to purchase ticket for the Memorial Day weekend when she was shot once in the temple . Miss Rachko was reported in stable condition after surgery at St. Clare 's Hospital . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas C. Young , described as " the simple arrest of a bum " ' began at approximately 7:15 A.M. yesterday when Officer Koebel , filling in on ' the early morning tour of duty for a vacationing officer , found the bearded - and disheveled Mr. Huger sleeping in the main concourse of the terminal . The officer , according to witnesses , es ' corted the 5 foot 8 inch , 140-pound Mr. Huger outside the building , to Eighth Avenue and 90th Street . The Two Men Struggle At that hour , the terminal was relatively empty of the thousands of commuters who would soon be pouring through the building , which stretches from 39th Street to 41st Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues , on the fringe of Times Square . Less than an hour later  --  about 8 A.M. , as the rush hour was beginning  --  Mr. Huger appeared once more inside the terminal . He approached people lining up to purchase Greyhound bus tickets and , Still barefoot , began " dancing around and annoying them , " according to Mr. Young . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he approached him and , without a struggle , led him to ao quieter part of the quickly-filling terminal , about 10 feet away . There , according to 18-year-old Pedro Flores , who works in a newsstand just yards from the Greyhound counter , Mr. Huger began shouting at Officer Koebel . The patrolman grabbed him by the neck and forced him up against a white brick wall adjacent to the terminal 's information directory , Mr. Flores said . The stocky officer held Mr. Huger around the neck with one hand while he held his walkie-talkie in his other , presumably radioing for assistance . Suddenly , according to Mr. Flores , the barefoot man tried to break away and the officer enveloped him in a hear hug , dropping his walkie-talkie in the struggle . The two men wrestled . Although the officer kept his arms firmly locked around him , the prisoner was able to free his hands . According to witnesses , Mr. Huger first grabbed the officer 's notebook , which he quickly discarded on the terminal floor . Then , the witnesses said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holster . To grasp the revolver , Mr. Huger simply unsnapped the leather cover of the holster . " The problem with that snap , " Mr. Young said , " is that the officer has to be able to open it quickly , but that means anyone can . " At 8:06 A.M. , police reconstructing the incident determined , Mr. Huger fired the first shot . " The guy just grabbed the gun and shot point-blank into the officer 's chest , " Mr. Flores said . The shot , doctors later determined , pierced Officer Koebel 's aorta and caused his death . Commuters Scramble for Cover " After the officer was shot , " according to Mr. Flores , who said he was standing four feet from the men , " too paralyzed to move , " the officer tried to get up and escape , " but the barefoot man shot him once more in the back . " As the gunshots sounded through the crowded terminal , screams of panic and warning followed as many of the commuters fell to the floor or hid behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , but Ile continued firing the gun wildly . It was then that Mr. Langam and Miss Rachko were hit by stray bullets . Officer Koebel had now managed to struggle to his feet for the second time and tried to run toward the Greyhound ticket counter when Mr. Huger turned toward him and fired once more , again hitting the officer in the back . As Officer Koebel lay prostrate in front of him , his blue uniform soaked with blood , Mr. Huger tried to fire once more , but the six-shot revolver was empty . " I heard the gun go ' click ' and then , when the barefoot guy realized the gun was empty , he hurled it with all his might into the officer 's face , " Mr. Flores said . Mr. Huger then retrieved the revolver and placed it in the back pocket of his trousers and began to move toward the Ninth Avenue side of the building , when Officer Kontje appeared . As Mr. Huger grabbed the gun from his pocket , Officer Kontje , without saying a word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . . According to witnesses , Officer Kontje , 44 , handcuffed the dying gunman , who wore only dungarees and a paisley shirt that blood had quickly colored a deep red , and shouted , " I hope he dies ! " Mr. Huger , who was described by Sgt. Robert Murray of the New York City police as " one of the psychos who hang around the terminal , " had been arrested March 13 for not paying a cheek for food he had ordered in a terminal restaurant , ' One of the Many Derelicts ' According to Mr. Young , Mr. Huger was " just one of the many derelicts who come in off the street and =Ito the terminal a terrible place . " " It 's the neighborhood , though , that 's really to blame , " Mr. Young went on . " These guys are always coming in off Eighth Avenue to annoy people . How was this cop to know that this morning was going to be different , that this time a simple arrest of a bum would result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of arrest we make 20 times a day in this place . " By 9:30 A.M. , both the rush hour and the shootings were memories . Two maintenance workers drove industrial floor washers over the grained white floor to remove all traces of blood . Another worker gathered the contents of Miss Rachko 's pocketbook , which had spilled onto the ground . A pile of orange tissues , now drenched with blood , lay in another corner of the ticket-counter area . Diagonally across the terminal from where Port Authority officers sketched in yellow chalk the outline of the fallen body of the murdered officer , a printed sign , hung weeks ago , filled the window of an office of the Continental Trailways Bus Company . The sign began , ' ' We do n't have to tell you that this bus terminal is run-down , dirty and dangerous ... "
