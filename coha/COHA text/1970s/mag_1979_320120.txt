A new study analyzes the myth of the Master <P> Sigmund Freud idolized Hannibal . So much so that for years he was psychologically unable to enter Rome because Hannibal had never set foot in the city . In fact , Freud 's ideas about himself were heavily tinged with mythic and military overtones . " I am actually not a man of science , " he once told his friend Wilhelm Fliess , " not an experimenter , not a thinker ... but a conquistador . " <P> That self-conception of the embattled hero helps explain Freud 's boldness and his endless attacks on opponents and colleagues . Yet according to a new study to be published this fall , it also had another , more surprising result : the standard version of Freud 's struggles , as recounted by Freud and the Freudian historians , is heavily laced with legend , and much of the story is just plain false . <P> Titled Freud : Biologist of the Mind ( Basic Books ) , this iconoclastic study does not deny Freud 's achievement . Says Author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a postdoctoral fellow in psychology at the University of California , Berkeley : " What remains today of Freud 's insights and influence ... provides ample testimony to his greatness . " But according to Sulloway , who spent seven years on the book , the historical record has been manipulated by Freud 's followers to make him appear more original , isolated and heroic than he really was . <P> As the Freudians tell it , Freud shocked Victorian sensibilities with his ideas on infant sexuality . Hostilely received by a narrow and deterministic medical Establishment , he retreated into his own private world to think up psychoanalysis all by himself . <P> All untrue , says Sulloway : the notion that infants possessed sexual stirrings was fashionable during the 1890s , even before Freud wrote about it , and the idea that neurotic conflict had a sexual component was also conventional . Indeed , says the author , many of the ideas that Freud synthesized into psychoanalysis had been around for years : among them , such now familiar concepts as the unconscious , the pleasure principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Freud 's closest friend for years , convinced Freud that all human beings were bisexual , and also offered ideas on the latency period ( low sexuality preceding puberty ) , reaction formation ( a defensive attraction to desires that are opposite of one 's deeper , dangerous wishes ) and something very close to the Freudian id . But , says Sulloway , Freud 's disciples later dismissed Fliess as a crackpot , partly to make Freud appear as the originator of these concepts . <P> Synthesizing ideas already in the air is hardly disreputable-Darwin and Marx did much the same thing-but Sulloway thinks that Freud went a bit far to create a myth about his absolute originality . Freud once accused Sexologist Albert Moll of stealing his concept of infant sexuality , though Moll had published his ideas on the subject nearly a decade before . When many observers spotted some of Freud 's ideas in the work of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer , Freud vehemently denied ever having read the two philosophers before inventing psychoanalysis . Sulloway thinks it unlikely : as a student in Vienna he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of Nietzsche and Schopenhauer.
