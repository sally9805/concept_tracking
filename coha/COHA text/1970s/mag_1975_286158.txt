With riches from six North Sea fields either landing or scheduled to appear on its shores , Scotland 's most important liquid asset these days is not whisky but oil . From the Shetland Islands ( noted for knitwear and shaggy ponies ) in the north , to Peterhead , Edinburgh and Glasgow , oil is becoming Scotland 's biggest industry . Already it is creating jobs , money and humor . One joke about the high pay of Scottish oil workers : " Did you hear that one of the welders married a commoner ? " <P> The capital of the activity is Aberdeen , an outward-looking city of 180,000 long accustomed to foreigners through export of herring and skills , both engineering and nautical : Aberdonians officered much of the Russian navy in 18th century czarist times . But nothing in Aberdeen 's gregarious history has quite prepared it for the influx of hundreds of oil-related companies ( 300 have operations there ) and thousands of oil workers from around the world , mainly the U.S. Last week 20,000 oil people were in town , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for " Offshore Europe 75 , " a $6 million exhibition of oil technology . <P> Since 1972 , the American impact on Aberdeen has been increasing relentlessly . On Union Street , the shopping center , Dunn &; Company , hatters , now carry Stetsons , and Grocer Hamilton Ross stocks Jack Daniel 's and Old Grand-Dad next to Glenlivet malt Scotch . For Southern U.S. tastes , there are jalapeno peppers , barbecue sauce and Smucker 's blueberry syrup . <P> Local talk proclaims that the Scots like the Americans better than the English . That could possibly be all too true . Scottish nationalists are on the march , declaring in stickers everywhere : IT 'S SCOTLAND 'S OIL . The growing Scottish National party favors an independent Scotland , with its own Parliament and its own lucrative oil industry for the benefit of Scotland 's 5 million people . At the very least , it wants more home rule , or " devolution . " The " Scotnats " have shown erratic strength at the polls ; most recently their candidate soundly defeated Labor and Conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously to send London a message voiced at other times since the Act of Union in 1707 , but never with the muscle of oil behind it .
