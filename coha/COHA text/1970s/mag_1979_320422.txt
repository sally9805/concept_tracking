A political leader of " the movement " speaks on I.R.A . aims <P> " I.R.A.-I ran away ! " With that derisive taunt , British troops arriving in Ulster ten years ago dismissed the threat posed by the remnants of the old Irish Republican Army . Their laughter died quickly after the birth of the Provisional I.R.A. , whose cold-eyed gunmen began ambushing Protestant loyalist civilians , policemen and the newly arrived soldiers with ruthless efficiency . But a decade of Provo bloodshed , climaxed by the wanton murder of Lord Mountbatten in Southern Ireland last August , has eroded much of the I.R.A . ' s support in the largely Catholic Republic . " They started well but now they 're Communists , " growled a Dublin workman over a pint of Guinness last week . " They do n't want Irish unity . <P> All they want is power , like the Ayatullah or Fidel Castro . " <P> Anti-I.R.A. attitudes have hardened in the Republic in the wake of the Mountbatten assassination , and police there appear to be having some success at curbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities seized a large shipment of contraband U.S.-made arms that included M60 machine guns , and last week they began the trial of two I.R.A . defendants charged with planting the bomb on Mountbatten 's boat . Though the two , Francis McGirl , 24 , and Thomas McMahon , 31 , are pleading innocent , detectives testified that they had traces of gelignite explosive material , sand and paint from the boat on their clothing . <P> Ireland 's Prime Minister Jack Lynch , meanwhile , arrived in Washington for talks with President Jimmy Carter , Congressmen and Irish-American leaders on the problems posed by the turmoil in Ulster , which indeed are beginning to show up in the U.S. Shortly before Lynch 's visit began , FBI agents in Philadelphia arrested I.R.A . Bomber Michael O'Rourke in Philadelphia on charges of illegal immigration . O'Rourke , who blasted his way out of a Dublin jail in July 1976 , may request asylum , but Irish authorities have moved to have him extradited . <P> A united Ireland has always been the goal of the I.R.A. , which looks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While Ulster 's 65% Protestant majority clings to its ties with England , the I.R.A . remains a potent force among Ulster Catholics , who chafe at the constant surveillance of their impoverished neighborhoods by armed British soldiers . <P> According to British intelligence , the supreme leader of the Proves is Belfast-born Gerry Adams , 31 , a sometime student and bartender who has spent 4% of the past nine years in prison without being convicted of a serious crime . In the past three years , the British say , Adams has honed the Proves into a deadly terrorist force . Despite their small numbers - there are only 600 to 700 gunmen , organized into cells of four to six men each - they manage to tie down 30,000 troops and police . A top British officer in Ulster says flatly : " Gerry Adams runs the I.R.A . in the North . "
