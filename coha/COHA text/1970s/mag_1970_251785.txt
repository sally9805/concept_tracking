Early one workday morning , a middle-aged housewife staggers downstairs , still half asleep , tying a well-worn tartan bathrobe around her . " Hey , honey , " her bright-eyed husband calls from the top of the landing , " would you mind starting my eggs ? " She nods , smiling slightly . " Hey , " he says again , cutely . " I love you . " Obviously this marriage is in trouble . <P> Or , more obviously , Writer-Director Richard Brooks thinks it is . Exactly why is never made clear , which is the crucial trouble with The Happy Ending . The lady in question is Mary Wilson ( Jean Simmons ) , who has been married for well over a decade to an enterprising Denver lawyer named Ered Wilson ( John Forsythe ) . Soon after the breakfast scene , Mary is revealed to be an alcoholic , pill-popping neurotic who flies off to the Bahamas to calm her tortured soul . Providing some salve under the sun are an old college buddy turned mistress-for-hire ( Shirley Jones ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benignly as Mary succumbs to the brilliantine blandishments of an aging gigolo ( Bobby-pardon , Robert-Darin ) . Refreshed and renewed , Mary returns to Denver and informs her husband that she is leaving home for good . <P> What drove Mary to this sort of behavior is tritely hinted at : the boozy infidelities of suburbia , the shattering of some romantic girlhood dreams , the parade of horror every night on the late news . What is stressed , underscored and bludgeoned home is the general ugliness of married life . Brooks just can not let it alone . Add to this a generous quota of misogyny ( lots of beauty parlor closeups of fat thighs , wrinkled faces , and housewives struggling into girdles ) , and the result is a film as misguided and one-sided as the marriage it struggles to portray .
