Businessmen charge he is too zealous . Ralph Nader calls him " a public servant who takes his public trust seriously . " His own associates merely marvel that one man can do so much ; a colleague says he routinely puts in 17-hour days , " going 90 m.p.h. all the way . " Stanley Sporkin , 44 , sees his task more simply : to throw a spotlight on wrongdoers . He heads the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission , which brings charges against companies for violations of securities laws and thus polices 9,000 public companies , 3,500 brokerage houses , 3,700 investment advisers and 1,300 investment companies . Though the SEC 's traditional concern is to stop fraudulent or manipulative stock transactions , Sporkin has also interpreted his mandate to include forcing companies to disclose the facts about bribes , kickbacks and illegal political payoffs . If that view of how to protect stockholder interests causes complaints-and it does-Sporkin has the almost missionary morality not to mind . <P> To date , his 600-person staff has forced the disclosure of massive overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northrop and United Brands . It has also encouraged more than 100 other companies to make voluntary confessions of unethical activities . And the end is not in sight . As a New York City securities lawyer puts it , " Stanley just can not stand the thought that somewhere in the world someone is doing wrong and not being punished for it . " <P> Machine-Gun Burst . Sporkin sees the violations as " a blight on our great economic system . We 've got to stop it . " He came by his love of justice from his father , a Philadelphia judge . After honing his business instincts by becoming a C.P.A. and a lawyer , Sporkin joined the SEC in 1962 , quickly gaining a reputation as a fierce investigator . When the job of top cop came open , Sporkin was a natural for it . But neither his superiors nor his wife nor three children have ever been able to make him look like a businessman-or a lawyer either . Enveloped in a rumpled suit , with a stubby tie barely reaching the slope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damon Runyon character who just finished an all-night poker game . <P> At work , Sporkin 's style is feverish . <P> During one recent hour-long meeting , he mapped out a course in management fraud for Yale Law School ( his alma mater ) while rewriting some SEC legislation and fielding half a dozen phone calls . Sporkin has also been known to lean back in a meeting with high-powered business executives for ten minutes of closed-eye contemplation that uncannily resembles sleep-and then deliver a machine-gun burst of pointed questions . <P> <P> Colleagues say Sporkin could easily triple his $37,800-a-year salary by going to work for a private law firm . <P> Because his job is so big and his budget so small-only $1.5 million a year - Sporkin has had to find shortcuts to save staff time and money . He has , for example , encouraged lawyers and accountants to watch for wrongdoing in the companies they serve , then report it to the SEC . Says Sporkin : " We get at least two or three tips a day from them . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
