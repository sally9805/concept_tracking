The letter to U.S. Chief Trade Negotiator Robert Strauss carried the strident ring of an ultimatum . Signed by Wilhelm Haferkamp , the German vice president of the European Community , and approved in advance by the Foreign Ministers of the nine member nations , it brusquely warned Washington that the Nine would retaliate if the U.S. began collecting extra import duties on a wide variety of their products . It also intimated that the Community would walk out of the three-year-old Tokyo Round trade talks , thus scuttling any possibility for their successful conclusion . What could follow , Haferkamp wrote , would be " a trade war of considerable dimensions . " <P> The reason for the European threat is a fast approaching deadline , which Haferkamp terms a time bomb . On Jan. 3 , 1979 , unless Congress passes a special bill delaying action , the U.S. customs service will begin collecting so-called countervailing duties on a long list of imported goods , headed by Danish canned hams and including a variety of European dairy products , such as Dutch Edam and French Camembert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items , including steel and perhaps some cars . <P> The U.S. action is mandatory under an 1897 law that orders levies slapped on imports that benefit from subsidies at home and thus theoretically can undersell U.S.-made products . In 1974 , shortly before the onset of the Tokyo Round of talks under the 84-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , Congress voted a four-year holiday on the imposition of the countervailing duties . The hope was that in the meantime the Tokyo Round would end and the dispute over subsidized exports be resolved . <P> Unfortunately , the negotiations , which are being held in Geneva , have dragged on and on . Despite a Dec. 15 deadline for a final pact , many of the thorniest issues still defy solution ; they include not only the subsidy question but also such matters as the ground rules for trade between developed and less developed countries . The 500 delegates from 98 nations have been meeting daily at GATT headquarters near the old Palais des Nations , but they are unlikely to reach agreement before time runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month huddled in Washington with congressional leaders in an effort to get an interim bill that would delay the duties . To his dismay , he found the mood on Capitol Hill running so strong against freer trade that he feared the bill would be either killed or encrusted with various protectionist amendments . He reported this to the Europeans and received the rocket from Haferkamp.
