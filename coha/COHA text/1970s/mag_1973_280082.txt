Two months ago , Uganda 's mercurial President General Idi ( " Big Daddy " ) Amin Dada packed off all the members of his Cabinet for 30 days of " vacation . " They were exhausted , he said , and needed a rest . Then he extended the enforced leave for another 30 days , announcing that the ministers ' permanent secretaries would run things in their absence . Last week the eleven surviving ministers-five others had been fired , one quit in disgust , and another , Amin 's brother-in-law , submitted his resignation by letter-filed into the presidential palace in Kampala for a 6 a.m. command breakfast . Those who showed up late , Big Daddy curtly announced , would be court-martialed . <P> It soon became clear that Amin had more than military discipline , or scrambled eggs , on his mind . Radio Uganda brightly described all hands as " looking happy and fresh after their two-month leave , " but their smiles soon faded . Big Daddy made the mildly ominous announcement that not only would the ministers not return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't return at all , and 98% of those who make it will not go to their former ministries . " Amin added that the permanent secretaries had done " very well " in the ministers ' absence and " provided brilliant ideas that I did not often get from you . " While he pondered a permanent government reorganization , the secretaries would continue to serve as acting ministers . They would also use the ministers ' official cars . " We will get other cars for you , " he told the Cabinet . <P> Amin saved his most extraordinary performance of the week for later . After dismissing his chastised guests , he composed a rambling cable to Richard Nixon , who had ordered a phase-out of U.S. aid to Uganda in response to the expulsion of the country 's Asians . " My dear brother , " Amin wrote , " it is quite true that you have enough problems on your plate , and it is surprising that you have the zeal to add on fresh ones . " Amin then ticked off some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viet Nam , the ITT fiasco in Chile , and , of course , Watergate : " At this moment you are uncomfortably sandwiched in that unfortunate affair . " Big Daddy signed off with a heartfelt benison from one hard-pressed statesman to another : " I ask almighty God to help you solve your problems . "
