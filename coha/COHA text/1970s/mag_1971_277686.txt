Sharing the Search <P> Sir : Your cover story on James Taylor March 1 was a delight . The Taylors personify the sort of torment and genesis of the young today . I am pleased that they are sharing their search with us . <P> MIKE OTIS Fulton , N.Y . <P> Sir : Here we go again . All the prerequisites for musical success are outlined there-confusion , insecurity , alienation , drug affliction . How ironic that this morass of self-pity is to be preferred over adult hang-ups . Oh , for the shaggy innocence of I Want to Hold Your Hand ! <P> LARRY TYLER Lawrence , Kans . <P> Sir : Your article infuriated me , but hard rock is far from dead . And the more adults - and magazines like TIME-who plan on its funeral , the less likely it is that there will be one . Adults have a terrible record when it comes to predicting trends in pop music . <P> BETH ANDERSON Albuquerque <P> Sir : James Taylor sings only too well the epilogue of a generation that has ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ore . <P> Sir : I am not sure whether to thank you for your article on James Taylor or to cry about it . All the references to his joy of privacy mean nothing , since by doing the spread you are violating that joy even while you write sympathetically about it . <P> KATHLEEN WICKERT Alexandria , Va . <P> Sir : We who live rock ' n ' roll do not need your straight press to tell us who our superstars are . The country is full of competent professional musicians , of whom James Taylor is one . <P> I enjoy " bittersweet and low " rock once in a while , like after a lot of good hard funky rock ' n ' roll . Tell Mr. Bender to turn up his headphones and listen to the heavies-if he can hear them . <P> CONRAD N. DE GENNARO Springfield , Va . <P> <P> Sir : Your genealogical garden <P> Grows quite contrary <P> Because you have omitted <P> Peter , Paul and Mary . <P> <P> BOB LAMBERT Williamsport , Pa . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate of the antiquated fundamental values of human life , I resented Gerald Clarke 's distasteful parody March 1 on a rare , decent book . Must all the chaste ideals left for us to hold sacred be indignantly slandered in this manner when there exists such a preponderance of depravity yet to assail ? <P> SUSAN E. LELLI Arlington , Va . <P> Sir : A bestseller may be a bit of a sob story or perhaps even related to the soap opera . Yet Love Story , in its Pollyannish way , does seem to be a purgative of sorts . Your parody , on the other hand , may be " a bestseller bested " or it may be pure pollutant . <P> ( MRS . ) SUSANNAH P. LOCKE Milwaukee <P> Sir : I did n't care all that much for Segal 's version , but yours was infinitely worse . <P> BERT BILSKY Milwaukee <P> Sir : What can you say about a man who takes the No. 1 marshmallow , sob story of the year , and turns it into a one-page masterpiece ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLOUSE Garden Grove , Calif . <P> Giving Up the Forest <P> Sir : Are you so sure that the tranquillity described in " The Cooling of America " Feb. 22 is not the result of activity rather than frustration or fear ?
