THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THE recent flareup on Cyprus brought back to mind a thought we have often had , which is that islands present some of the most intractable problems in world affairs . Some foreign -- policy experts or diplomats may have gone into this , but , if so , it has escaped our notice . For example , the feud between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots would probably not have lasted over the centuries and grown in bitterness if they had all retrained on the Eurasian mainland . There , the Greeks and the Turks are n't exactly chummy , but at least they stopped killing each other some years hack . No one really seems to remember what the Cyprus hostilities are all about  --  their origins , we mean , hack in the eighteenth century  --  but they persist and will doubtless do so for another century or two .

The West Indies Federation , found ? d in 1958 , crumbled only blur y cars later , in part because people on one island had little knowledge of those on the others . Few Jamaicans have ever seen Trinidad , and vice versa , though a great many have seen New York and London .

The only solution we call see to all this is to link every major island to the nearest mainland .

( imp at Auto Show THE major-league umpires have a new " get tough " policy this year , meaning they will be " available for interviews " after games to talk freely about all the mistakes the play-ers , managers , and coaches made in the- preceding nine innings . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years have talked about  --  and last year did something about  --  grad-ing the umpires ' work . ( Such a report card appeared in the Sporting News last September . ) And that 's why Nick Colosi , National League limp , was a featured attraction at the Auto Show last week . It 's strange to hear an um-pire talk  --  it 's like interviewing a Trap-pist monk . Nick talks well . He 's a slim umpire , is forty-seven years old , has 20/15 vision , came up to the majors in September , 1968 . Friendly , ( 11v , business-like. , he looks as if he 's going to listen to you , and he looks as if he 's tough . Used to he a captain at the Copaca-. liana , hails from Mas-peth , and threw out the first ball  --  a matzo Kill at the opening of the new Lindy 's , on lower Broadway , last ea ; fick broke into the business in 1962 , when he took a six-week course at Al Somer 's Umpire School , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outs ; that 's got ta come from you . But they can teach you how to stand , how to move , how to position yourself , which means bow to get to a FEDR.VARY 17 , 19 7 5 place before a play happens , so you can see it when it does happen . The first thing they teach you is how to be comfortable behind the plate . Then they teach you to stand on the baselines  --  in a slight crouch , with your hands on your legs just above your knees , so that you 're free to move to either side . And then all you have to do is look and listen . " At the be g.nn.m .. - of 1968 , Nick was working the International League and had expectations of coming up with the American League . But the National League bought his contract . " The leagues are just like ball dubs  --  they steal from each other , " he said . " My youngest son , who was seven , was such a Yankee fanatic he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After I signed with the National , he would n't speak to me for two weeks , because he thought I could 've given Mantle a few breaks .

I was hoping someone would ha the ball , so I could run . You feel better when you run . Finally , someone hit a fly to short center , and I bet I heat Stahl , the Mets center fielder , to the ball . He looked up and said , ' Man , what are you doing here ? ' " Nick talked about famous arguments and ejections , and Joe Valerio , of the Post , asked him if there were certain magic words that , if employed by a ballplayer , could force an umpire to eject him immediately . Nick said that , contrary to popular belief , there were no magic words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The maddest I ever saw Durocher was when Dock Ellis , the Pittsburgh pitcher , called him an ' old reprobate .

Zoo Message AFRIEND has sent us a report from the . Bronx Zoo : A while back , I went to the Bronx Zoo , because I had heard that there was going to he a wildlife lecture at the World of Birds , and , would n't you know it , I got there twenty minutes late and missed the whole thing . A tour guide explained that what I had missed was not really a lecture but , rather , a mini-lecture , Something to do with the propagation of the green wood hoopoe , about which I shall continue to know virtually nothing . Fortunately , the curator of ornithology decided to give another talk , mini-er than the first  --  this one a play-by-play commentary on a slide presentation that was synchronized with birdcalls . Each time a new slide appeared on the screen , the curator said something like " Of course , you all recognize this birdcall , " and of course I never did . The bird sounds , however , did make sense : the western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Widow , does seem to say chuck s widow . And the mourning dove sounds like a dove mourning , although it also sounds like someone whistling into a Coke bottle . Anyway , it occurred to me that the reason I could n't recognize any birdcalls is that the inhabitants of the World of Birds almost never say anything  --  at least , not when I 'm around . Actually , the only animal noises I ever encounter at the zoo are human noises mothers dragging little girls in yellow snowsuits by the hand and saying , " Jessie , stay away from that cage . You 're no fun to take anywhere , " or fathers at the bird nursery saying to theit children , " Oh , looked Look at the cute wittew baby buhds , " or boys standing in front of the iguana cage shouting , " Hey , Mom , I found another tail ! " I do n't blame the iguanas , but you 'd think that the birds would have something to say . I tried the crepuscular crooners , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc crepuscular . No action at the exotic-bird cage , either . I said aloud , " Hmm . Toucans live as cheaply as swans . " Silence . A punch line in search of a joke . I walked past the cages for the elephants , rhinos , and hippos , and found the inhabitants particularly laconic ; in fact , they were absent . In the pygmy-hippo pen , there was a single gray squirrel , and a young girl was feeding it popcorn through the fence . Next , I explored the sounds of the Reptile House . Twice  --  once near the puff adders and another time near the spitting cobras  --  children popped balloons about three feet from my head . When you consider how I feel about reptiles , you 'll realize that I took these surprises personally . When the second balloon burst , I thought for a moment that the thunderstorm scheduled for three-thirty above the crocodile pools had begun . It finally came at three-fortyfive , complete with a tape recording of thunder and a strobe light for lightning . The crocodiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit . It was like this everywhere . Only as I left the zoo and walked toward the subway did my ears really perk up . I heard a cacophony of screaming voices and the whirring and grinding of metal against pavement , and the sounds were drawing closer . I looked over my shoulder , and there , flying down the hill , were about a dozen two-legged creatures on roller skates . Calligraphic Art " IN the study of American folk all , " " I Bruce- Johnson , director of the Museum of American Folk Art , writes in the catalogue of this museum 's current exhibition , " Calligraphy : Why Not Learn to Write ? , " calligraphy is the term that has been used to describe 18th , 19th , and 20th century quill and steel pen drawings made with repeated cursive flourishes and strokes , either making recognizable letters or having a character or style resembling the strokes used to form letters . These drawings were used as learning exercises to give the student penman an interesting diversion from the repeated penning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hand . " They also gave the accomplished penman a dramatic means to show his prowess or to ads ertisc his profession . We attended the opening of the show  --  nearly two hundred exhibits . all but three of them borrowed front other institutions and private collectors , including two rendered at the lunatic asylum on Blackwclls Island around 1850 . " Calligraphy was occupational therapy there , and at other such places , " Mr. Johnson told us , and , after inspecting a number of delightfully cursive birds , lions , horses , and deer , most of them in motion , we copied our a **26;4961;TOOLONG learning exercise , " Pursue Useful Studies , Nantucket School , " by Rachel Gardner , a nineteenth-century student pc nw ( ) Marl Gratitude There is not a more pleasing exercise of the mind than gratitude . It is accom-panied with such an inward satisfaction that the duty is sufficiently rewarded by the performance . It is not like the prac-tice of many other virtues difficult and painful but attended with so much pleasure that were there no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it hereafter a generous mind would indulge in it for the natural gratification that accompanies . This homily came from the collec-ti on of Mrs. Barham Johnson , the Niuseum 's president , who lives in Princeton in a house that is a scrimshaw and whaling museum . " Come and see it , " she said , and she introduced us to Mr. Frederick Fried , author of a hook on carrousels and a lender to the show of the Blackwells Island items and several calligraphic designs of his own . He whipped out a sheet of white paper and tossed off a swordfish , with flourishes , which he inscribed " The Pen Is Mightier Than the Swordfish " and graciously presented to us . We turned to the gallery 's only gastronomic exhibit , a " Calligraphic Torte " titled " Homage to Saint Honore " ? a two-foot-square cake designed by George Lang , a Restaurant Associates pioneer , who wrote the " Gastronomy " and " Restaurant " articles for the latest edition of the Encycloptedia Britannica .

" I had it made by Bruno Conlin , the executive pastry chef of The Four Seasons restaurant . St. Honor : , bishop of Amiens in the seventh century , was the patron saint of the Paris pritissiers . Calligraphy was probably first used on pastry by Franz Sacher , in 1832 , in a cake for Metternich . A couple of years later , Sacher wrote ' Sadler ' on one of his works , and the Sacher Torte was born . You can do beautiful calligraphy with royal icing . I 've seen the first page of the Gutenberg Bible done in this way . " Mr. Lang , who now heads a corporation that advises hotel chains , airlines , and convention centers on food and restaurants in nine or ten countries , said that he had a research library of three thousand books on gastronomy .

Miss Mercer THESE are the ways we celebrated Mabel Mercer 's seventy-fifth birthday , which fell on Monday , February 3rd : We talked with Alec Wilder , because he has known Mabel Mercer since 1941 , when she first settled in this country ; because he has written some of his best and most famous songs for her ( " It 's So Peaceful in the Country " is one ) ; and because he has come to think of her as a sort of indispensable mother-sister-aunt figure . Secondly , we went to the birthday party given for Mabel Mercer on the St. Regis Roof 133 the hotel . And , thirdly , we visited with Miss Mercer herself . AEC WILDER was in a corner of the Algonquin lobby reading a Warwick Deeping when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn for fifty years ( a tweed jacket and gray flannels ) ; his hair , coursing with winter electricity , was standing on end ; and he had a pipe in his mouth . " I ca n't , I 'm not sorry to say , go to Mabel 's birthday party , " he said , re-moving the pipe and speaking in his customary dredgelike voice . " That sort of event is just too much for me , and anyway I 'm due on Grand Cayman Island two days before . But I 've writ-ten Mabel a letter putting it on the line , telling her exactly what she means to me . And I 've sent her a plant , one that 's in bloom now and that she can put in the ground later at her place near Chatham , upstate . When I first met her , at Tony 's , on West Fifty-second Street , it was instant acceptance on my part , which is very rare , since meeting strangers has always been a threat to me . Indeed , she soon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my drinking days , and if I came into Tony 's noisy or wobbly , she 'd give me one look and I 'd find myself re-proved and behaving correct-ly . It was n't an angry or dis-approving look ; it was just a very elegant look . Or if I came in depressed she 'd sense it immediately and sing a whole set of my songs , many-of them written just for her . And I 'd find myself cheered up . But then Mabel is a healer . I 've gone up to visit her in the country a perfect wreck and in two days felt marvellous . It is n't that she does anything , that there is any laying on of hands or such . She just putters around her house , and cooks , and feeds her animals . But there is some quality , some corrective force , in her very presence . Little by little , she 's improved her place . She 's managed to pay off the mort-gage , and when she 's had a few extra pennies she 's added a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing at all any-more she 'll have her house to live in , and that 's a blessing . " Whoever is giving off the negative vibes will desist immediately if he knows what 's good for him . " Even better would be if some of her rich admirers  --  and she 's had dozens-go t together and set up an anonymous trust fund . But , knowing the rich  --  or , rather , not knowing the rich , despite decades of trying  --  that 's highly unlikely . " Mabel 's singing is n't like any singing I 've ever heard before . It is n't jazz singing and it is n't pop singing and it is n't classical singing . It 's wholly original . Sometimes , over the years , she 's sung songs I have n't particularly cared for , but I 've always found myself listening . She invariably involves you : you catch her enthusiasm for certain lines she sings , and you listen for certain of her technical devices , like her changing of values on particular notes each time she sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a strong feeling of normality in the rooms Mabel sang in . You 'd look up and down and see an extraordinary cross-section  --  college professors , polite-society types , lawyers , Ivy League kids , singers and musicians , people , like Dave Garroway , who 'd come bag and baggage straight from the station or airport . She 'd hold whatever room she was in in her hand , and do it with sheer dignity . She never said anything when she started a set or when it was over . She cat down and sang and got out . If there was talking or laughing , she stopped singing . She did n't look at anyone , she did n't say anything . She just stopped and waited . And when the racket subsided she started to sing again . " In those days , we laughed a lot . We even laughed at outr ? things , as long as they had style . Mabel has a genuine sense of humor , and by that I mean not only does she laugh at jokes but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a lot , and one night I noticed that , even with her marvellous diction , the words ' I 've got my man ' were coming out sounding like ' My goat my man . ' When I told her , instead of asking me to go jump , as most singers would have , she laughed so hard she almost fell on the floor . " IT WE were assigned at Mabel Mer- cer 's birthday party to a table built for ten but seating sixteen . ( Four hundred people bought tickets at twenty-five dollars a head , plus liquor . ) Elbows perforce were pinioned , and the roast beef with potatoes and string-beans was served in flying-wedge fashion . But it took a long time for the food to arrive , and before it did a white-haired , pink-faced Mabel Mercer admirer who attends all her openings and who was seated on our left passed us a note , which read : This reminds me of a dinner party on the Poseidon , except in the movie I seem to recall they got something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starboard lifeboats are being manned ; the ship 's orchestra is playing " Up a Lazy River . " At 10:19 P.11.1. , goodbye all . Vincent Astor , who used to own this hotel , would never have permitted this . Nor would he have allowed us to sit here and inhale Earl Wilson 's cigar smoke ( he 's sitting behind us ) . A short time later , Mabel Mercer arrived , and after the standing ovation a long-faced man sitting on our other side introduced himself as Edmund Anderson and told us that the St. Regis Roof opened in 1936 , that it was given its Viennese look by the designer Joseph Urban , who had worked for Ziegfeld , that it was first called the Viennese Roof as a result , and that on the night it opened Jacques Frey and his orchestra were dressed in Viennese costumes and powdered wigs . At ten-forty-five , Donald Smith , who helped organize the birthday party , announced that the festivities would start in eight minutes . But they did n't , so Anderson went on to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert on the Viennese Roof that was played by six musicians from Duke Ellington 's hand and fourteen musicians from the New York Philharmonic , and that it was called a High-Low Concert , the High being the longhair music and the Low the Ellington . Tickets were only five dollars , he added , but nobody came . Forty-two minutes after Smith 's announcement , the city gave Mabel Mercer an award , and the evening officially began . Sylvia Syms and Cy Coleman sang his " The Best Is Yet to Come . " Sylvia Syms was in superb voice . Jimmie Daniels , who is also in his seventies , delivered " What Is This Thing Called Love ? , " and was followed by Thelma Carpenter , who belted out " I Ca n't Give You Anything but Love . " Someone named Erik Thorendahl came on like Lanny Ross , and gave way to Mary Lou Williams , who did a long , multi-tempoed
