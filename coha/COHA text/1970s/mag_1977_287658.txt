The first announcement that the President of the Soviet Union had been stripped of power was not even the lead item on Radio Moscow 's 5 p.m. newscast . After a droning , ten-minute report last week on a speech by Party Chief Leonid Brezhnev came a terse sentence : " At a plenary meeting of the Central Committee Nikolai Podgorny was relieved of his duties as a member of the Politburo . " Next morning Pravda buried the news in the 26th paragraph of a 29-paragraph story on the meeting . Kremlinologists expect that Podgorny , 74 , will be formally ousted from the presidency when the Supreme Soviet , the U.S.S.R. 's rubber-stamp parliament , gathers later this month . <P> Even by Kremlin standards , it was an ignominious end to the career of a stolid , dutiful party leader who had served for 17 years in the 15-man Politburo . As chief of state for nearly twelve of those years , he had been hitched to Brezhnev and Premier Aleksei Kosygin in the ruling troika . Even Nikita Khrushchev , who was ousted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 70 , was ushered out more gracefully . The official 1964 bulletin declared that he had resigned " in view of advanced age and the deterioration of his health . " <P> The news of the shake-up puzzled Kremlinologists . In March , Podgorny had made well-publicized state visits to Zambia , Tanzania and Mozambique ( TIME , April 4 ) . There had been no advance notice of the Central Committee meeting needed to legalize a top-level change . On the very day of Podgorny 's dismissal , Pravda had front-paged a proclamation bearing his name . Moreover , neither Podgorny 's health ( visibly robust ) nor his advanced years have offered any cause for speculation . By contrast , both Brezhnev , 70 , and Kosygin , 73 , suffer from ailments that often provoke retirement rumors . <P> The full story of Podgorny 's dismissal may remain forever behind the scrim that veils the Kremlin 's backstage dramas . Still , specialists hurried to put together plausible reconstructions . With hindsight , it seemed likely that Podgorny had somehow managed to arouse Brezhnev 's ire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high-level policy . Having yielded all real power to Brezhnev a decade ago , Podgorny had settled cheerfully into the highly prestigious but largely ceremonial post of chief of state . That , some experts thought , had been his downfall . <P> By their accounts , Podgorny stood in the way of Brezhnev 's wish to add the presidency to the host of new titles , honors and decorations that he has garnered since his birthday in December . " It may have been that Podgorny dug in his heels and refused to go , " says British Sovietologist Leonard Schapiro . Podgorny may also have opposed one of Brezhnev 's pet projects : a new constitution , which is scheduled to be made public this week . The first since 1936 , the constitution is believed to call for the Party Chief to be President as well . Brezhnev has long fumed that , unlike many East bloc leaders , he is not entitled to the full protocol honors due a head of state when he travels abroad .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
