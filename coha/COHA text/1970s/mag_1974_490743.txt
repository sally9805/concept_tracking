THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment A the conference on the Middle East was getting under way , a small item in the news reminded us of what people mean when they talk about interdependence nowadays . We read that the Soviet Union has large supplies of oil in Siberia but that the wherewithal for getting it out exists only in the West . The Soviet Union , then , depends on us to help with its energy needs , just as it looks to us for computer technology and for occasional shipments of grain . This is just one more , perhaps minor link in the chain of dependence that connects the conferees in Geneva . The Soviet Union increasingly depends on us , and the Arabs depend for their arms on the Soviet Union . The Europeans and the Japanese depend for their oil on the Arabs . We depend for our common defense and our economic well-being on the Europeans and the Japanese . And Israel , for its arms , depends on us . The chain runs full circle : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are direct and obvious links of dependence . There are others , less direct and less obvious but no less real . The entire world depends on both the Israelis and the Arabs not to draw the superpowers into war . And the Arabs depend on the industrialized nations as a market for their oil . Their recent moves have put that market in jeopardy . The terrible humiliation that the Arab nations have imposed on Japan and the European nations in the last few months has become one of the permanent prices of Arab oil , no matter what the Arabs now do about their embargo . They have let the world know that a nation that relies on Arab oil is a hostage and has virtually lost its sovereignty . This is one of the highest prices that can be paid in polities , and nations will go far to avoid paying it . Since the onset of the nuclear age , the Soviet Union and the United States have been more intimately dependent on one another than any two nations have ever been before , inasmuch as no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another quite so thoroughly . An endangered Soviet Union is a Soviet Union dangerous to the United States , and an endangered United States is a danger to the Soviet Union . We dare not endanger one another . Now , owing very largely to the fuel crisis , what used to he seen as true only of the Soviet Union and the United States is seen as true of all the nations that are represented at the Geneva conference , and of many that are not represented . The conferees in Geneva will he talking about a peace settlement , but the real subject of their deliberations will be the survival or the extinction of nations  --  of the Europe an nations , Japan , Israel , the United States , and the Soviet Union , to name a few , Some of the conferees may he reluctant to sit next to each other , but each nation 's survival depends on the survival of all the others . Now even the Arabs and the Israelis will have to school themselves in the vexing , elaborate new political art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time IF ' ever a Voice of Protest Award should be established , we would like to nominate three citizens ' groups  --  Environmental Action , Consumer Action Now , and the Village Green Recycling Team . The three groups recently held a ceremony at the Biltmore to announce their creation of two awards the Disposable Planet Award and the Energy Hog of the Year Award  --  as protests against the activities of Keep America Beautiful , Inc. , which was also in the Biltmore , holding its twentieth annual meeting and , incidentally , handing out some awards of its own . To explain : Keep America Beautiful is the organization that produces all those radio and TV adverfisements telling you not to litter , and it is supported main ) by the beverage and packaging industries . Though it is known mostly for its anti-litter campaign , in recent years it has sought to educate the public about pollution in general , and at its annual meeting it bestows awards on people who , by conducting useful local programs , seem to have been educated particularly well . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contend that K.A.B. serves as a public-relations instrument for the industries that support it . These industries have opposed the outlawing of of I - depsit , no-return bottles , and  --  so the accusation goes- - they would very much like the public to believe the K.A.B. slogan " People Start Pollution . People Can Stop It . " People , that is , and not corporations . Before the recent K.A.B. annual meeting , a member of Environmental Action called us up and told us that the three groups were going to hold what they called a " counter-awards ceremony " while K.A.B. was distributing its awards . The counter-awards ceremony was to be on the second floor of the Bihmore , and the K.A.B. meeting in the eighteenth and nineteenth floors . That sounded to us like a safe enough distance apart , so we decided to go over and see what would happen . The counter-awards ceremony took place in one of those neutral rooms , furnished with small padded chairs , which hotels keep ready for people who have something to announce . In the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all full of litter  --  Coke bottles , Budweiser cans , and so on . Seated along the walls of the room were about a dozen thoughtful-looking members of the citizens ' groups and one or two photographers . The ceremony had two parts : first , a young woman named Patricia Ta ) lor , who works for Environmental Action , stood beside the litter and read a statement , and then the photographers took pictures of several of the 2 2 citizens with cans and bottles in their hands . Here arc some excerpts from Miss Taylor 's statement , which was read in a rapid monotone : Tremendous amounts of time and effort have been expended by citizens across the country publicizing and seeking solutions to complex environmental and social problems . One problem that we feel has received a disproportionate amount of attention and publicity is that of litter . Few people realize that the " litter problem " that members of K.A.B. are so concerned with is in fact the source of income for many of its founders . Do Coke and Pepsi really think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just that people end up throwing them away , and they become litter . Anti-litter campaigns are at their heart a matter of blaming the victim  --  and glorifying the victimizer for its " public-spirited sentiments . " ... K.A.B. has attempted to blame the consumer for the problems created by the proliferation of " convenience " ? no-deposit , no-returnpackaging , which its supporters manufacture . For these reasons , we would like to present Keep America Beautiful with the first annual Disposable Planet Award .... For the first time in our nation 's history , natural limitations are forcing us to reevaluate our entire way of life , A national energy-conservation program of any serious nature demands a close look it the proliferation of throwaway beverage containers . In 1972 , eighty-threepoint-seven billion soft-drink and beer containers were manufactured in the U.S. , three-quarters of which were throwaways . Three hundred and eighty-four trillion B.T.U. 's of energy were Consumed I in making I these fifty-nine-pointnine billion throwaways . The aluminum beverage container is especially energy-consumptive , requiring four times as much energy to deliver the same amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , In terms of electrical energy , Dr. Priscilla Laws , of Dickinson College , Carlisle , Pennsylvania , has calculated that energy wasted in the production of throwaway beverage containers would meet the electrical needs of an affluent city of seven-point-five million people for an entire year . For these reasons , we would like to present the Energy Hog of the Year Award to the manufacturers of throwaway beverage containers . Miss Taylor also paid tribute to the people of Oregon and Vermont  --  states that have laws against no-deposit , no-return beverage bottles . Eager to have an answer to these charges , we took an elevator to the eighteenth floor , where a K.A.B. " photo reception " was in progress . Upon arriving , we saw a floodlight in the midst of a crowd , and , moving closer , found that a camera crew was photographing Shirley Temple Black . Mrs. Black , who was on hand to make some " remarks " at the awards banquet , glowed in the light : she was wearing a midnight-blue V-neck dress , a gold filigree necklace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of high-school students was shepherded into her presence , and after they were released they came toward us . We learned that they were members of Project CUOPstanding for " Clean Up Our Passaic " ? from Kearny High School , in Kearny , New Jersey . Besides helping to clean up the Passaic River , Project CUOP had built a minipark and held a " hike day , " and for all those reasons K.A.B. was giving it a Special Merit Youth Award . Michael Camerman , the chairman of Project CUOP , answered our questions . Michael is sixteen , and he seemed neither more nor less than that . He told us that he had n't heard of the counter-awards ceremony on the second floor . We repented the downstairs charge that K.A.B. is supported by the beverage and packaging industries , and he said , " That 's true . " Thereupon he pulled out a copy of the program for the annual meeting and opened it to a long list of organizations  --  the Sierra Club , the Wilderness Society , the American Legion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have looked puzzled , because Michael said , " Oh , no . I made a mistake . That 's the K.A.B. National Advisor ) Council . " He turned to another page , which listed K.A.B. 's board of directors . This included officers of the American Can Company , United States Steel , Pepsi-Cola , Philip Morris , Northwestern Glass , and other corporations . " Do you think it 's possible that some of these corporations actually contrihum to the litter problem by selling throwaway bottles ? " we asked . " Well , even with throwaway ' bottles you can have scavengers go across the countryside and collect the bottles for recycling , " Michael said . " People can make a business of it . " " But does it make as much sense to break bottles and recycle them as it does simply to use them over ? " we asked . " You 're right . It 's better to use them over , " Michael said . " That 's why they have that law against throwaway bottles in Oregon . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we said . Michael nodded . " Su in that sense you do n't disagree with the people downstairs " we said . JANUARY 7 , 9 7 4 " No , I do n't , " Michael said . On that conciliatory note , we thanked Michael and left Later , we spoke by phone with Roger %V , Powers , the president of K.A.B. , who said that he had n't known of the counter-awards ceremony while it was going on . " I wish I could have met some of thnsc people , because I would have loved to talk to them . You know , this whole environmental movement began with Earth Day a few years ago , but unfortunately emotionalism crept into it and we began to point the finger at one another . Emotionalism like that ca n't solve problems . We take a positive approach . Our whole program is directed toward the individual ; we try to stimulate a sense of individual responsibility for environmental improvement . Litter-prevention is the first step ; once people get involved in litter , they begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you say that you are directed toward individuals , do you mean that you leave out corporations ? " we ask'ethat are individuals ? " Mr. Powers asked in reply . " Individuals can be industry executives , individuals can be hIuc-collar workers , individuals are all Americans . " 114r . Powers pointed out that in addition to officers of corporations the K.A.B. executive committee includes two " public " members  --  Ralph P. Davidson , the publisher of Time , and Mrs. Donald E. Chisel " , vice-president of the League of Women Voters . Mr. Powers told us that he had been with K.A.B. for four years and that previously he had been a representative of " a group of industries in the government-reLltionS area . " " What industries were those : " we asked . " The beverage and packaging industries , " he said . Motifs THERE were two motifs at the Mission : Impossible party . There was a cultural motif , and there was an economic motif . We will try to explain both . The cultural motif had to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People operating above ( and well above ) the poverty line . That is , both drinks and drugs were available . The economic motif had to do with the fact that Mission : Impossible is an ad-hoc promotional group that has recently spent four and a half million dollars of other people 's money in an attempt to rescue ( with THE NEW YORKER its Creative Promotional Powers ) a foundering chain of gargantuan discount department stores . There was considerable interaction between the two motifs . That is , people used drugs and drank drinks while they discussed ( at different levels of coherence ) the spending of the four and a half million dollars . The party , by the way , was a success . The Mission : Impossible party was held on the top floor of a Vest Side hotel . The top floor of this particular hotel is painted blue and is outfitted with white furniture . Most of the people attending the party were dressed in ways that were consistent with the spirit of this decorative scheme . Rollin Binzer , the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the people who blended with their surroundings . Mr. Binzer , who is dark-haired and energetic , wore a pistachio satin shirt and a purple jacket . We talked with him about the creation of Mission : Impossible . " I was working on the new Stones movie , " he said . " That was a bit of a hassle , but that 's another story . Now , my attorney just happens to be the court-appointed attorney for these stores -- Arlan 's Department Stores , Inc . They arc this enormous operation , with about a million giant stores , except that no one ever heard of them . Anyway , by last May they were bankrupt  --  Chapter I 1 ? and my lawyer was involved . By October , the creditors had told them if they did n't get their numbers right they 'd have to close in January . So my lawyer called me . They needed a whole new approach . A whole new creative direction . I needed the money . So I agreed to meet these guys from Arlan 's after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But I saw them the next day at lunch . I took the job right off . The guy from the store said , ' Do you know what you 'll do ? ' I said only a fool would say what he would do before he saw " No , that was two corned beef on rye , a cheeseburger , two coffee regular , one black , and a prune Danish . " profit-margin , high- vol um e basis . They spent about seventy-eight million dollars in one year on merchandise that was strictly promotional ? -I mean , they made no profit on it . Excuse me . I 'll catch you later . " After our talk with Mr. Binver , we walked around the party . A blond child in a blue-red-and-yellow patchwork shirt and a rhinestone belt threw some paper swirls at us . Then a young lady maned Leslie Brooks , who was wearing green pants , a green sequinned top , and a pink boa , Caine and told us some more about Mission : Impossible . " Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars to spend in nine weeks ? " she asked . " That guy , " she said , pointing to a man in overalls who was dancing , " was in charge of TV . Wc called all our friends . We got people just because we thought the ) were smart . Like we got a black guy who was a bodyguard at screenings of the Stones movie . And Rollin 's brother Vaughn . Vaughn was a major in the Army until he dropped out . And Dan Richter . Dan 's a movie-maker . He art-directed the whole ape scene in 201 ) 1 . ' He was in ' 2001 ! He was the head ape that threw the thing up , you know ? And Farooq Farooq Hussain is a twenty-five-year-old physicist who invented a machine for talking with dolphins . He 's a professor at what-do-you-call-it  --  St. John 's , or London University , or one of the good ones . He had a lot of scientific projects for us , but they bombed . He was going to make lightning flash all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like that , but they bombed . After they bombed , he became an art director for the stores . The whole thing was really a trip . I mean , we brought sales up forty per Cent , but now we 're going to split , because we do n't want to get into running the company . " After talking with Miss Brooks , we talked with Linda and Charles Whitt III and Kenn ) Kneitel , of the Fluid Drive Studio , who put together most of the ads that Mission : Impossible commissioned for Arlan 's . " We accepted the job at ten at night , " Charles AVhite said , " and we had to have an ad out by eleven the . neat morning . " " The best thing we did , " said Kenny Knritel , " was ' The Night Before Christmas . ' We cut ' The Night Before Christmas ' into three parts and ran each part as a full-page newspaper ad , on three consecutive Saturdays . You ended up with a poem five feet tall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like the reindeer 's names . Comet ' was a can of Comet cleanser , with little hands and feet . And for ' Up the chimney he rose ' we had two heft ) sandwiches going up the chimney . " We noticed that the blond child who had been throwing things was asleep on a pile of coats that had grown up on a white wicker chair . We also JANUARY 7 , , 197 4 noticed some applause- " It 's a verY moving moment , " said Linda White . " The Mission : Impossible team just presented an eight-color heart-shaped neon sign to Rollin and Leslie . " Good News from Ne5.2 ) Haven WE took advantage of a recent visit to New Haven to call on Louis L. Martz , the new director of Yale 's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library . We found him in the company of Dr. Gordon N. Ray , president of the Guggenheim Foundation and a noted book collector and authority on Thackerayi the two men were poking around the contents of a recent bequest to the Beinecke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the library of Charles J. Rosenbloom. of Pittsburgh . We joined them in examining first editions of " Mob ) Dick , " " Mein Kampf , " " Daisy Miller , " " The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes , " " My Antonia , " and " The Scarlet Letter " and other Hawthornes , and asked Mr. Marta what the Beinecke did about duplicates . " We 're reluctant to dispose of duplicates , because you never know when you might have a variant  --  a cancelled page , a change in typography , and so on , " he said . " We 're continually upgrading the collection , so if we get a better copy we may sell off the old one . But we try to weed out , and decline , identical copies in THE NEW YORKER 25 gifts , so that other places can get them . " " Rosenbloom was a high-spot collector , " Dr. Ray said , still poking around . " He bought gems in all fields . That 's what people did in the twenties . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he went on , examining a hook , " but it 's in had condition . I 'm not surprised , when you see where it came from . " He pointed to a preRosenhlootn bookplate , which we will not identify . The Guggenheim Pooh-Bah went off to a meeting in another room , and Mr. Martz treated us to a guided tour . " We do n't collect separate prints or drawings  --  they should he in the Yale Art Gallery , " he said . " We do n't buy works of art , but we have a lot of them in portfolios or in hooks , especially in French illustrated books , such as those given by Frank Altschul and John Hay Whitney . The Gertrude Stein collection included portraits of her and Alice B. Toklas , and two chairs with tapestries by Picasso , and we 've accumulated busts of Thornton Wilder and others . Here is our Ezra Pound center . " This was a room filling up with the lifetime archive of Pound 's manuscripts , proof sheets , and correspondence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at six and goes on to correspondence with Yeats , Eliot , and Joyce , " Mr. Martz said . " They sent him their proofs . The archive is important , because he knew everybody and corresponded with everybody . WTe purchased it from the Pound estate . Wc closed the deal last June , after ten years of negotiation with pound 's wife and with his daughter , Mary de Rachewiltz , who kept most of the archive in her castle in Italy , near Merano . It came in a great shipment of fifteen wooden crates and trunks , many of which are still not unpacked . It will take our staff several years to sort the things out . No other archive of a modern poet is as extensive . We also have the Edmund Wilson papers , " he went on , as , on a subbasement level , we entered a big area of tightly packed drawers and boxes . " This tier contains our American-literature collection . I happen to think that the first half of the twentieth century in America was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine repository fur studying this . " We glanced at folders of Wilson , Marquand , O'Neill , Stein , Carl Van Vechten , William Carlos Williams , Mabel Dodge Luhan , The Dial , Hound &; Born , the Theatre Guild , Langston Hughes , Edgar Saltus , Robert Nathan , Edith XVharton , and Henry James , and , on a subsubbasernent ? level , penetrated Western Americana . " Here 's where we have a lot of art , " our guide said . " In the nineteenth century , artists were sent West by the government to make sketches of the land , Indians , and so on . " More art , including the Cary Collection of playing cards twenty-six hundred packs , famously illustrated and going hack five hundred years . Half of the cards were from Germany and France , the rest from almost every other country in the world . " We can still print up sixteenth-century cards quite nicely from our printers ' blocks , " Mr. Martz said , and he showed us some examples . The new director , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty , came to Yale , after Lafayette , as a graduate student , and has been teaching there since 1938 . He is an authority on the English Renaissance , an editor of English seventeenth-century verse , and the author of hooks about Milton , Donne , and ' Thomas More . His wife , Edwine , has been , t member of Wihnarth S. Lewis 's " Walpole Factory " for thirty-two years . Martz has been chairman of the English Department and is now Sterling Professor of English . We asked him how Yale was getting along . " In the bad times of the late nineteen-sixties , in response to student restlessness , a committee ! appointed by Kingman Brewster recommended a seminar program in the residential colleges and encouraged undergraduates ? to suggest courses , with outside teachers approved hs the faculty , " he said . " I was for three years chairman of the program . Some of the suggestions were pretty far nut  --  How to Repair an Automobile , for example  --  and we did n't approve them all , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cantonese , and many in the areas of medicine , politics , and judicial procedure . We 've called on the Law , Medical , and Divinity Schools to teach some of these  --  the first time some of the graduate faculty have taught undergraduates . The program has proved that you can work with students 00 a curriculum in a controlled way . In any event , the Yale of 1973 , unlike the Yale of 1968 , is calm . " , Xs we rose to leave , he said , " The Vietnam war and the draft caused the trouble . Those were the generating things . It was not a deep-seated sickness , as so many thought . ' here 's been an amazing difference within the past two years . We have a dedicated , zealous group of students . One of them , who is working on his Ph.D and whom I recall as a rebellious undergraduate , said to me the- other day , ' I 'm having such a good time with my dissertation !
