 | The Message of The Fourth WHEN I WAS a child , and the century was also young , the Fourth of July was ? after Christmas ? the happiest day of the year . It was a thrilling day of wonderful sights and sounds , of exciting smells . Red-white-and-blue was everywhere : flags high up on poles atop the public buildings , snapping straight in the wind ; flags hanging down limp over front porches ; flags on the lampposts , the wagons , even the horses ' harness ; little flags parents bought , three for a dime , for their children to wave at the parade when it went up Main Street . The background music of The Fourth was the noise of fireworks ; and every sm boy , tossing aloft his penny string " crackers , " or cocking his cap pi tol , imagined himself a hero , lea ing a charge against the Redcoat Redskins or Rebels . These imaginary battles were suspended at mid ? morning , when our parents called us to " hurry , " or we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or small ; a parade is a parade is a parade . But there was one Fourth of July parade I saw , ) when I was six or seven , that is still vivid in my memory . The mayor , the town band , the police- and fire-department contingents had gone by , and there was a gap in  | parade . Then , suddenly , came the mighty rat-a-tat-tat of marching drums and the fierce shrill of a fife , and my father leaned down to my brother and me and said , " Here 's the Spirit of ' 76 . " And up Main Street came the ritual Fourth of ( lily trio . Three Revolutionary generations , marching abreast into the first battle for America 's Freedom : the white-haired old drummer in shirtsleeves and waistcoat ; the tall young fifer with the bloodstained bandage around his brow ; and the drummer boy , no older than my brother . As we would say today , the medium was the message . Right behind them marched a soldier in khaki real soldier ? bearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hats , and everyone , standing straight and silent , put his hand on his heart as Old Glory went by . After the parade , the marchers and the watchers ( which generally meant the whole town ) assembled in Courthouse Square to hear the Important Person deliver the glorious Fourth of July oration . A hunting-trimmed platform for the orator and wooden benches for the townspeople were usually erected for this great occasion . Parents promised their children that if they would sit still and listen , they could have " ice cream and sasparilla " later . First on the program was the Reader of the Declaration of Independence , who was chosen largely for his lung power . " When , in the Course of human events . . . all men are created equal . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights ? Life , Liberty , and the pursuit of Happiness . . . . " So much we children could n't help hearing . But when the Proclaimer began listing the interminable tyrannies of wicked King George , we began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't really scold when we blew up our empty popcorn bags and burst them with our fists . But we were shushed again when the Important Person mounted the platform . He always mopped his brow and face and neck thoroughly before he began . From then on , I remember , he just dripped . " My fellow countrymen wide gesture , embracing the whole town , we are come together to celebrate the birthday of our nation . . . . We are come together to resolve , once again , that this grr-reat nation significant pause ? this nation , under God ! jabbing forefinger heavenward ? will always remain the home of the free and the land of the brave .... " Did we children listen as he went on and on ? Very little . By then we were yearning for night to fall , and impatient for the really big event : 127  | the Fireworks ? the sparklers , Roman candles , pinwheels , rockets . And yet , somehow , the essence of the oration came through td us : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of our nation was the most important event in history since the Birth of Christ . The orator believed , and our parents believed , that Providence itself had decreed that the Revolution should be won , the Union preserved , and America should become a great and prosperous nation . The orator believed , and our parents believed , that the Republic had a providential mission : to show all the nations what blessings ( what opportunity ! what security ! what prosperity ! what happiness ! ) could flow to a people who rooted their political order in the moral order . As a child , I imagined that God had called the Founding Fathers up into the Adirondack Mountains , and handed them the Declaration of Independence , just the way he had called Moses up on Mount Sinai to give him the Ten Commandments . And so it was when the century and I were young . FOR A PEOPLE , as for a person , believing is all . All history bears witness that it is the believers who win the Revolutions , found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise up great cities and great institutions . The doubters , the cynics , the unbelievers ? they can scarcely shake the pebbles from their shoes , much less move mountains . 128 The crisis in America today , a in all Western nations , is a crisis belief . Only 22 percent of Americ express strong confidence in the a ity of either free enterprise or t federal government to solve th economic problems . A poll of Fl ida residents showed that , of th who did n't vote in the recent Pr dential primaries there , nearly h said it " makes little different which party wins in Novem And in the richest , strongest , fre country in the world , the majority the people believe that those charge " do n't really care what ha pens to me . " What has gone wrong ? And ho shall we set it right ? We will n get the answer by stuffing our co puters with statistics on the GN inflation , unemployment , urban d cay , crime , drugs and pollutio Statistics are mirrors held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not li the image we see reflected in the we can not change it merely by a cusing the mirrors of distortion . The image will change only i somehow , we can re-establish the belief that this nation , in Abrahatti Lincoln 's words , is truly " the lag best hope of earth . " It will change only if we , the people , can find with in ourselves the moral and politics responsibility to make it change and then to preserve it as well ii the next 200 years as our forefather did in the last 200.
