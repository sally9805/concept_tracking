There is no joy these days at the Washington headquarters of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , which represents some 750,000 various government workers throughout the nation . Wails Jerry Wurf , the union 's president : " Every day I come to work and there 's a stack of clips on my desk from around the country . Most of it 's bad news . The courts are dumping on us , and the politicians think we 're great whipping posts . You might say we 're the object of some hostility . " <P> Faced with rising budget deficits , many states and cities are , indeed , getting unusually tough with their employees . What is more , officials are enjoying wide public support as they take stern measures to hold the line on wages , cut back on overtime , lay off workers , demand greater productivity and fire public servants who walk off their jobs despite the existence of no-strike laws . <P> John Bailey , an AFSCME official in Oregon , says he and his aides are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not they really have the money . If we find it , we 're going to be very hard-nosed in our bargaining . If it 's not there , who are we trying to kid ? You ca n't squeeze blood out of a turnip . " Nonetheless , Wurf and his union are trying to battle back with a $1 million advertising campaign , the theme of which is that public employees are not really looting government treasuries . Says Wurf : " All those classy pensions people think we 've got-half of them are meaningless because there 's no money to pay for them . " <P> The situation is not really that simple . Pension funds are indeed running short in many cities , but the contractual commitment to pay the pensions remains . High pensions and other fringe benefits have , in part , forced New York City into its continual flirtation with municipal bankruptcy . The city has long had a cozy relationship with its police , firemen 's and sanitationmen 's unions . But last week even New York 's militant unions faced up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's 247,000 employees , accepted a two-year , " no cost " contract that provides only for modest cost-of-living salary adjustments ( at most , $543 a year ) . More pointedly , the contract allows such raises only if they can be offset by increases in productivity or reductions in fringe benefits . As a result of the agreement , Treasury Secretary William Simon announced that New York would immediately get a $500 million installment on the $2.3 billion in loans promised by the Federal Government . The loan enabled the city to survive yet another deadline in meeting financial obligations or going into bankruptcy . <P> New Yorkers are far from alone in demonstrating hostility toward public employees . Some examples : <P> Detroit last week notified 972 policemen that they would be laid off for economic reasons . The startled cops retaliated with a wave of " blue flu , " calling in sick . Detroit Mayor Coleman Young said officers who can not document their illnesses will lose pay .                @ @ @ @ @
