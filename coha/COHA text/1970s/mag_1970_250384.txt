For Czechoslovaks-and for much of the world-Aug. 21 will live forever in infamy . On that day two years ago , Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia and crushed the country 's promising Springtime of Freedom , which was led by Reformer Alexander Dubcek . The first anniversary of that event was marked by three days of violent anti-Soviet demonstrations in Prague and a dozen other cities . Last week , on the second anniversary of the Soviet invasion , the dispirited Czechs did not bother to protest . <P> " What would it change ? " shrugged a young mechanic from Kladno . In Prague , some Czechs placed flowers and candles on the grave of Jan Palach , the student who burned himself to death on Jan. 16 , 1969 , in protest against the invasion . The flowers and candles were removed by the authorities . <P> For its part , the government of Party Leader Gustav Husk declared a day of thanksgiving to the Soviet Union and the other Warsaw Pact nations for saving the country from the counter-revolutionists by their invasion . Throughout Czechoslovakia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At a parade in Karlovy Vary , celebrating the conclusion of the largest joint Soviet-Czechoslovak military maneuvers ever held , even old President Ludvik Svoboda , once an ally of Dubcek 's , mouthed a party slogan : " With the Soviet Union forever , and never otherwise . " <P> Resisting the Ultras . Under the circumstances , the quiet observance of the anniversary was the wisest course for the Czechoslovaks . Though Husk is a stern hardliner , he is nonetheless determined to prevent the country from sliding back into the reign of police terror that characterized the pre-Dubcek days . The peaceful anniversary may help Husk convince the Soviets that he has the situation under control and that his program of " normalization " is almost completed . This would enable him to resist the demands of the Czechoslovak Ultras , who want a return to even stricter political controls and show trials for the liberal leaders , including Alexander Dubcek , who is thought to be somewhere in Slovakia . <P> On the day of the anniversary , Husk was in Moscow , where he attended a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of the five-hour conference , it was Husk who thanked the Soviets on behalf of the Warsaw Pact leaders present for calling the conference . He also hailed the renunciation-of-force treaty between West Germany and the Soviet Union , which was described in the conference communiqu as a step toward " relaxation and normalization . " Since the Bonn-Moscow pact has been signed , nothing appears to stand in the way of a similar treaty between Bonn and Prague-as long as the Czechoslovaks properly conceal their enthusiasm for opening up contacts with the West .
