For Richard Nixon , the impossible dream may be on the verge of coming true . Or so he believes . The President has confided to intimates that he thinks he has a chance of winning all 50 states in November-a feat of unanimity accomplished by George Washington , who had to contend with many fewer states and ( in those partyless times ) with no opponent . Such a comparison with the father of the country would do wonders for the Nixon image . <P> Still , landslides often bury more than the loser . James Monroe also took every state when he was re-elected in 1820 , losing only one electoral vote to John Quincy Adams . He was credited with ushering in an Era of Good Feeling ; in four years it dissolved into an orgy of ill will . A century later , Warren Harding squashed his opponent James Cox by almost two to one , and then stepped into the infamous Teapot Dome scandal . Lyndon Johnson likewise swamped Barry Goldwater , only to be crushed himself by the Viet Nam War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to be .
