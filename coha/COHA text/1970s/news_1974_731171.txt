Though Iraq itself has not observed the oil embargo or export cuts against Western Europe and Japan , the semiofficial Baghdad newspaper Al-Joumhouriya attacked what it called " readiness by the defeatist regimes to end the ban . " Both Libya and Iraq warned oil-consuming countries against accepting President Nixon 's invitation to a Washington meeting of oil consumers Feb 11 .

Positions similar The Arab position opposing a " consumer bloc " is essentially that of France , whose Foreign Minister , Michel Jobert , began a visit to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait Jan. 24 . Oil quarters here believed Mr. Jobert would finalize a big Saudi-French deal for long-term supply of Saudi oil to France in return for industrial goods and arms . Oil-industry sources here say Mr. Jobert may conclude a similar deal with Kuwait . In recent weeks Britain , Japan , West Germany , and Italy have also been negotiating direct oil for arms or industrial-goods transactions with Iran or the Arab oil producers . These deals bypass the big Western oil companies , which are mainly U S - owned.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
