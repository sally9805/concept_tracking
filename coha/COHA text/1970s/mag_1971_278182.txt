Balmy Southern California has long been a natural habitat for nudists . But now the new permissiveness has caught up with this once-daring tribe . After visiting a former citadel of the cult near Los Angeles , TIME Correspondent Timothy Tyler reports : <P> Mel Hocker , one of the alltime great American nudists , is still out there in the nude . But he is not smiling and carefree , the way you would imagine a nudist to be . At 60 , Mel sits alone in his little office , a mass of naked wrinkles , glum , dispirited , forlorn . Forlorn because just outside Mel 's screen door , his own twelve-acre nudist club-the Oakdale Guest Ranch-is going silently to seed in the dry heat of the San Bernardino Mountains . In fact , the club 's membership in two years has plummeted from 300 to 60 couples , and it continues to plummet as the elderly members die off . Another nudist camp near by recently closed up for good . <P> " It 's the sexual revolution that 's killing us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 18 years . " The pornographic movies , the topless-bottomless bars , the dirty magazines-they 're making nudism in America pass . " To show what he means , Mel slips into shower clogs and takes us on a tour of his camp , mercifully letting us keep our pants on . The layout of the place hints of its past grandeur : 16 rustic cabins idling on a hillside , and down on the flat , dozens of vacant trailer slips where you can almost envision happy , laughing naked people swarming around gaily decorated mobile homes . But now , Mel says , the remaining members are mostly middle-aged and elderly couples who come out only on the warm weekends . The grandiose pool is empty , tennis and volleyball courts are unused , nets hanging limp in the sun . <P> The only sounds of life come from a screened hut with a sign on it that says CORNER NUDE STAND . Inside , a pretty young woman is dancing nude to a jukebox ; the other patrons , mostly older males , sit drinking beer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall says NUDI BURGERS . MORE MEAT LESS DRESSING . Hocker sits down , sips a Coke and brightens somewhat . " I pioneered in nudism , you know " he shouts over the music . " We were the first nudist place to serve beer , and we were first with nude dancing . This place has attracted your professional people , right down to the honorable janitor who pushes the broom . "
