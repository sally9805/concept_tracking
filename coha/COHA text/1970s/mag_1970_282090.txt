CITY LIFE by Donald Barthelme. 168 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $5.95 . <P> <P> The dust jacket provides the perfect image for the contents . An older man and a girl , dressed in what appears to be nightshirts , are dancing a sort of ring-around-a-rosy . Despite clasped hands , the two are curiously abstracted . Their eyes do not meet . Their smiles do not match . A vaguely Marat/ Sade promise of violence seems to be in the air . The manic energy of the dance generates no gaiety , no warmth . This is a social act in a vacuum-dance seen as antic pathological spin . <P> Welcome to Donald Barthelme 's world . <P> Barthelme is a quiet , scholarly young Texan-former philosophy student , former art-museum director-who writes the most disturbing and inventive short stories around . Taken together with his earlier books , Come Back , Dr. Caligari and Unspeakable Practices , Unnatural Acts , the 14 stories of City Life establish him as the master experimentalist of his genre . He is a writer who may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beckett , Ionesco and Pinter have changed the definition of a play . <P> Scaling the Glass Mountain . What goes on in Barthelme 's surrealistic , mad-dance little world ? In the first place , it is peopled with the oddest , the most chillingly funny characters : Horace , a gourmet-policeman , whose pice de rsistance is Rock Cornish hen ; Lars Bang , a coachman out of a period print who hits and runs like a Mafia mobster ; and there is even the Phantom of the Opera 's Friend . <P> Barthelme 's settings are even odder than the characters who inhabit them . Barthelme writes about a country named Paraguay . It is not in South America ; it is a neverland where everybody has the same fingerprints and sexual intercourse occurs only when the temperature is between 66 and 69 Fahrenheit . <P> In another story , Barthelme summons up a glass mountain at the corner of 13th Street and Eighth Avenue . With the help of climbing irons and a plumber 's friend , one of his fixated antiheroes tries to climb it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30,000 giant pictures of the great Russian master as well as a 640,086-page Jubilee Edition of Tol-stov 's published works . <P> But Barthelme characters and Barthelme settings pale beside Barthelme plots-or what passes as plots . One story consists of 100 sentences , neatly numbered . Another story , Sentence , is just that : 7 pages of breathless , free-form monologue dotted by commas , colons , even exclamation points , but nary a period-not even at the end . The Explanation is formed as a series of questions and answers . But the answers start turning into questions themselves , and of course nothing is ever explained . <P> Pinning down a Barthelme story is obviously a surrealistic experience - rather like trying to explain a Groucho Marx joke to someone who has never heard of Groucho Marx . In desperation Barthelme critics sometimes resort to the comparison gambit , frantically coupling their man with a host of others in the course of one review . The catalogue ranges from Dickens , Swift and Joyce to Kafka , Nabokov and Henry Miller .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
