They are thousands of elderly couples living out their lives in the sunny , ramshackle old-age ghettos of Florida or Arizona or Southern California . Widows and widowers , they come together for companionship , but frequently dare not marry because if they were a legal couple their Social Security payments would be reduced . So , often to the unaccustomed moralistic dismay of their children , the elderly go " unchurched " and endure the mailman 's smirks . <P> To relieve at least this one indignity of old age , Connecticut Congressman Robert H. Steele has proposed what is now erringly called the " Steele Senility Sex bill , " which would allow the same Social Security payments to married and unmarried alike .
