txt President Ford 's forces here , fully aware that Mr. Ford must stop Ronald Reagan 's momentum in Nebraska or it could spill over into a Ford disaster in Michigan , are not at all certain they can do it . Just before Mr. Reagan 's run of recent primary wins , the President apparently held a commanding lead here . A highly regarded poll showed Mr. Ford at 54 percent and Mr. Reagan at 33 percent . A decisive Ford victory was predicted by knowledgeable sources . Now , just before Tuesday 's crucial primary , Mr. Reagan clearly was closing in and the outcome was in doubt . Mr. Reagan now is causing excitement wherever he goes ? more than Mr. Ford . A few days ago Mr. Reagan received what observers called an " unbelievable " reception among the farmers and ranchers of western Nebraska . The whooping and the yelling in the audiences told reporters that Mr. Reagan was catching on . One reporter found that this was not just an enthusiastic response to a Hollywood celebrity . " Everyone I talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Reagan was saying ? and that they intended to vote for him . " // *Nebraska primary // Phone canvassers for Mr. Ford found , right after the Texas primary , that , the President 's lead was holding up , - but since Mr. Reagan 's win in Indiana ' ( along with Georgia and Alabama ) , these canvassers have been receiving another story : Their lead is melting away ? Mr. Reagan is on the inarcP . Why ? These canvassers report , confidentially , that many of the " undecideds , " along with those who were tepidly for Mr. Ford , now are beginning to view Mr. Reagan as the eventual winner of the nomination ? and they want to vote for a winner . Further , they report that Nebraska Republicans , as a whole , are quite conservative ? and they tend to believe that Mr. Reagan is more of a conservative than Mr. Ford . The " farm issue " continues to damage the President 's campaign effort here . Grain farmers still fault him for curbing their opportunity to make money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of such exports in the future ? but many farmers here still are skeptical . Nebraska , too , has the " home state " element ( although much smaller ) for the President that Michigan does . Mr. Ford was born in Omaha , and he underscored this by visiting the site of his birthplace Saturday . There is a lot of basic support for the President . And many Republicans will vote for him , too , simply because they are proud to have a Republican in the White House or because as some have admitted ( canvassers say ) that they would not want to embarrass their President with a primary loss here . But " charisma " seems to be sweeping the nation in this presidential campaign . On the Democratic side , Jimmy Carter seems to have that certain something in his smile that draws the voters to him . And the Reagan personality ? like Mr. Carter 's ? is stirring up the crowds . Mr. Carter , incidentally , seems due to win again on Tuesday . As against this personality element the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This personality element should not be important , " one observer here commented . " But it is clear that it is becoming very important in this race for the presidency . "
