Absentee Owners of America ? III Power in the Big Banks by Vic Reinemer Thirty-six hundred enterprises retail electricity in the United States . Two hundred and ten of them collect 86 percent of the $21 billion annual electric bill and spend a seventh of the new construction investment of all American industry . They call themselves " investor-owned . " The small , 14 percent end of the electricity market is served by a thousand rural cooperatives and more than 2000 public systems . There is n't any secret about who owns them . Rural electric cooperatives are run on the basis of one customer-one vote . The publicly owned systems operate as adjuncts of city government , as in Seattle , Los Angeles , Jacksonville , Memphis and Springfield , Ill. , or through utility districts , which are common in Oregon and Washington . The federal government does n't retail electricity , but it does wholesale it through such agencies as the Tennessee Valley Authority , the Bonneville Power Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation . Since the mid- ' 50s federal power generation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time , federal tax collections from the big private companies have decreased from 15 to seven percent of their revenue . Who owns the investor-owned utilities ( IOUs ) ? When utility executives talk about ownership they use the term " beneficial owners , " the people who receive the dividends ? those employees , pensioners , widows and orphans pictured in the " Who Owns Us ? " advertisements . But corporate policy is the province of the proprietary owners , the institutions and individuals who have the power to vote other people 's stock , and who have their own ways of profiting from utility operations . Every year each IOU files a report with the Federal Power Commission purporting to show the voting power of its top ten stockholders . Most of the reports are phony , but every year the FPC accepts them and puts the misinformation on public display . Let 's look at Carolina Power and Light for an example . Its board chairman , Shearon Harris , recently completed a year 's tour as chairman of the Edison Electric Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board chairman of the National Association of Electric Companies , a utility lobby . Harris ' company reported to the FPC this year that 12,496,612 of the 16,767,958 total possible votes were cast at its last stockholders ' meeting . The top ten stockholders and their voting powers were listed as follows : Merrill , Lynch , Pierce , Fenner and Smith , a diversified financial company , and Prudential Insurance Company of North America , are for real . The other eight are not . They are " street names " or " nominees , " i.e. , pseudonyms and post office drops for institutional investors who are chary about seeing their names on ownership reports . Sigler &; Co. is really Manufacturers Hanover Trust . Kane &; Co. is Chase Manhattan . Atwell &; Co. is US Trust of New York . Steere &; Co. is Girard Trust . Wake &; Co. is Wachovia Bank and Trust , the largest bank in the South . John Watlington , Jr. , the president , is a director of Carolina Power and Light . He is also a director of CP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natural Gas . Watlington is but one of 568 interlocks between major banks and utilities . That figure does n't come from the FPC , which does n't have it , but from Angus McDonald , a former Farmers Union lobbyist , after weeks of research at the Library of Congress . Three of CP &L's; " top ten " are the same New York bank , First National City Bank . Citibank 's three accounts ? Stuart , Thomas and King ? add up to more than a million shares . Financial experts say that a five percent voting interest in a corporation can control if the other votes are scattered . CP &L; has 35,752 stockholders . Citibank has voting control of at least 71/2 percent of the votes in CP &L.; Take another example , Virginia Electric and Power . Citibank controls 71/2 percent of the votes at VEPCO , which reports holdings by Citibank in three nominee accounts . Unlike CP &L,; VEPCO at least adds after each nominee , in parenthesis , " % First National City Bank . " Prudential Insurance owns more than 800,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of a million of them . Last year Sen. Lee Metcalf ( D , Mont. ) asked the FPC to explain the discrepancy between VEPCO 's and Prudential 's reports . FPC bucked the query to VEPCO , which finally found the unreported shares in six nominee accounts named Oneco , Twoco , Treco , Forco , Fiveco and Octco . ( The insurance company also has a dozen other pseudonyms , including Sixco , Sevco , Aftco and Cadco . ) Of the 210 major IOUs , ten small ones are owned principally by a few individuals or a family . Forty-seven are completely controlled by holding companies . That leaves about 150 in which institutional investors congregate their holdings . Insurance and investment companies often are among the top ten stockholders . But banks , especially big banks , dominate . Fourteen big banks are among the top ten stockholders of ten or more electric utilities . Chase Manhattan , using four different street names , appears among the top ten stockholders of 42 utilities . Morgan Guaranty Trust , using 13 nominees , is among the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five nominees , appears among the top ten of 31 utilities . Citibank , State Street Bank and Trust of Boston and Bankers Trust of New York are listed among the top ten stockholders of 20 or more utilities . The other banks listed among the top ten stockholders of ten or more utilities are New England Merchants National Bank , Bank of New York , Northwestern National Bank of Minneapolis , US Trust of New York , Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust of Chicago , Girard Trust of Philadelphia , National Shawmut of Boston and Chemical Bank of New York . Utility holding companies file ownership statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Their reports are even less informative than those filed with the FPC by operating companies , and indicative of unreported concentration of voting power among institutional investors . This year the Southern Company , a utility holding company headquartered in Atlanta , reported that the only stockholder with more than one percent of its voting securities was the Affiliated Fund , with 666,950 shares ( 1.07 percent ) . Citibank almost simultaneously reported it held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half times as much as the " largest stockholder " reported by Southern . Middle South , which is actually a New York utility holding company , says that only one stockholder has more than one percent of its stock . Citibank ( which deserves an electric warming tray for being more candid than many institutional investors ) reports that it holds more than three percent of the stock of Middle South . Harvard holds a similar amount , through several investment enterprises including " President and Fellows of Harvard College , " State Street Investment Corporation and the Harvard-Yenching Institute . The key individual in these accounts , Harvard Treasurer George Bennett , also sits on the board of Middle South . He earned his director 's fees years ago by persuading the SEC to overrule its staff and permit Middle South executives to grant themselves stock options . The banks that dominate the IOUs , either directly or through holding companies , do not go unrewarded . Frequently they use their strong position inside utilities to siphon off funds on which they pay no interest , and which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " compensating balances . " Before the bank makes a loan it requires the borrower to deposit a percentage of the loan in an account which bears no interest . Arnold Hirsch , who has represented many public groups including the City of New York in rate cases , says banks have been raking in windfalls through this scheme , thanks to interest-free utility deposits . A variation was applied recently by the Alabama DECEMBER 23 Sr 30 , 1972 Power Company , most of whose directors are bankers or lawyers for banks . Four million dollars in bank deposits were included in the company 's rate base , which should include only the depreciated cost of plant and equipment . That way the IOUs ' owners were able to earn a return off money deposited in the bank ? money that could , instead , have been earning interest for customers . Another beneficial arrangement enjoyed by banks involves the payment of utility bills . Ask your banker what financial arrangement he has with utilities for payment of customers ' bills and you will probably get a vague answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state legislator , says his arrangement is simple : People never pay their utility bills through his bank , but a utility pays him a set fee for the " service " each month . The big banks ' interest in IOUs is sometimes reflected in their advertising . Back in the Eisenhower administration , Guaranty Trust attacked public power in full-page ads at a time when its board chairman was also board chairman of Duke Power . More recently , as utility advertising and promotion budgets have properly come under sharp criticism , banks have solicitously picked up part of the IOUs ' image-making tab . A First National Bank of Chicago full-page ad this summer blamed environmentalists for the energy crisis , which in truth is due principally to poor planning , sales promotion , a rate structure which encourages waste while penalizing the poor , and the IOUs ' opposition to a national power grid . Corporate headquarters of First National are located at One First National Plaza , which is also where Commonwealth Edison is based . Commonwealth 's president and a Commonwealth director sit on First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top ten blocks of stock in Commonwealth , along with significant holdings in Texas , Indiana , Kentucky and Iowa power companies . Banks also urge rate increases and frenzied financing to meet the energy crisis . Chase Manhattan last July issued its " Outlook for Energy in the United States to 1985 , " which concludes that " restrictions that have stifled both the generation of capital and the incentive to invest must be removed at once . " The recommendation appeared on the same day that Chase Manhattan Corporation , the holding company for Chase Manhattan Bank , reported a 25 percent gain in operating profits for the second quarter of 1972 . Nowhere in Chase 's fancy brochure was there mention of the concentrated control of America 's energy resources . There is no lack of alternatives to bank control of " investor-owned " electric power companies . One would be to replace the mutated " one share-one vote " principle with the democratic " one man-one vote " concept . " One share-one vote " is not sacrosanct and has no basis in common law . Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each share renders a combination between a few principal stock-25 holders , to monopolize the power and benefits of the bank , too easy . " He argued for " the prudent mean , " in which large stockholders would have a reasonable but not controlling degree of weight . William Penn 's Free Society of Traders and other early American business enterprises sharply restricted capital 's voting rights . Hamilton 's " prudent mean " is applied within corporations in a number of capitalistic countries , but lobbyists wiped its last vestiges off the books in the US by the beginning of this century . Another long-proven alternative to bank-controlled IOUs is public or cooperative ownership . Rates charged by most public power systems are substantially below those of IOUs . According to FPC statistics , the average price of publicly retailed power was about 11/2 cents per kilowatt hour in 1970 compared to 2 ' /4 cents for IOUs ? a 50 percent difference . Public power systems also return to their communities , for public purposes , an average of 20 cents out of every revenue dollar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their absentee stockholders an average of 15 cents out of every revenue dollar . And unlike bank-controlled IOUs , public systems are locally controlled and sensitive to the needs of users . Cooperatively owned electric systems , located in rural areas , are holding their own financially . That is no mean accomplishment for small institutions which are required by law to provide areawide service in the countryside , which people are leaving , and prohibited from serving the cities and towns where farmers go . IOUs have almost ten times as many customers and 15 times as much revenue per mile of line as co-ops do . It was this difference in density and revenue between rural and urban power systems that led Congress to establish the two percent Rural Electrification Administration loan program in the ' 30s . IOUs as well as co-ops are eligible for the REA loans , but the IOUs find they make more money by borrowing from bankers at higher rates and refusing to service out-of-the-way places . Nowadays the two percent REA loans supply about half the co-ops ' construction needs . They must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher rates . The blended interest rate is thus rising , leaving the co-ops with low-density loads and diminished financial advantages . Yet they still get power to their customers for about two cents per kilowatt hour , which is better than a majority of IOUs . Co-op customers , who are also the owners , can help decide with their votes what their local power system does . That is also the prospect in places such as Berkeley and Foster City , California ; Norman , Oklahoma ; Falls Church , Virginia and dozens of other communities where citizens are challenging the franchises of IOUs . The interest in starting new municipal power systems is higher now than at any time during the past 25 years . The cozy and costly bank-utility monopoly may yet be rolled back .
