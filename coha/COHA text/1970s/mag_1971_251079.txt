WE first heard the news of the fighting between India and Pakistan when both capitals began issuing a series of sharply conflicting claims . Radio Pakistan announced that India " has launched an all-out offensive against East Pakistan , " while India 's Prime Minister Indira Gandhi said this was " Pakistani propaganda " and " wholly untrue . " <P> To sort out all the contradictory reports , TIME immediately assigned six correspondents to the story . Bill Stewart and Jim Shepherd covered the Indian side from their base in New Delhi . Two former New Delhi correspondents , Dan Coggin and Lou Kraar , flew into Pakistan from their regular posts in Beirut and Singapore . Bill Mader and Friedel Ungeheuer provided back-up coverage from the State Department and the United Nations . In the combat zone , however , most local officials did their best to confine foreign correspondents to the rear areas and to harass them with red tape . The results were sometimes frustrating . <P> " I came to Pakistan prepared to see the kind of tank battles I had witnessed during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabled from Rawalpindi , " but I found this town completely quiet . It made me feel like that correspondent in Evelyn Waugh 's Scoop , who cabled his home office , ADEN UN-WARWISE , while a competitor reported , ADEN WARWISE . The main event that evening was a dinner that President Yahya Khan was giving for the Chinese Communist First Minister of Machine Building , <P> Li Shui-ching , who was here to dedicate a factory . President Yahya talked informally with reporters and expressed some unusually tough warnings to India . But the only evidence of war that night was the blackout which was quite unnecessary . " <P> From the correspondents ' files , and from background research assembled by Reporter-Researcher Susan Altchek , Contributing Editor Marguerite Johnson wrote the cover story . A veteran of TIME 'S Art section , Marguerite shifted to World last winter after taking a five-month-long excursion around the globe by freighter , jetliner and Trans-Siberian Railroad . Upon her return , she was assigned to what seemed at the time a relatively tranquil part of the world : India . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subcontinent . " The conflict , " she says , " is so suffused with ancient religious , cultural and racial hatreds that it is difficult for any Western journalist to comprehend it fully . There are times when the Indians and Pakistanis do not seem to understand it either . "
