" Elections Are Opposed The wave of terrorist action of the last month began after it was announced that General Lanusse had begun , through intermediaries , negotiations with Juan D. Perlin , the exiled former dictator , on the participation of the powerful Peronist movement in the election as a legal party . This political solution , with the labor-based Peronist movement participating in an election that would end six years of military rule , is opposed by leftlwing extremists who want the violent overthrow of the military and of the " capitalist system " in Argentina .

Mr. Santucho and another top guerrilla leader named Quieto have received political training in Cuba , according to Argentine security sources . The Government 's repression of subversives has produced numerous arrests . Some of those arrested have never been found in prisons or are not known to have been released .
