Americans were both bemused and bewildered by Charles de Gaulle . He was often one of the most infuriating allies this nation has ever had . Like Kremlinologists , a priesthood of State Department experts devoted years to trying to penetrate his mind on NATO and other issues . For a time during the ' 60s , many exasperated American laymen simply gave up French wines and trips to Paris . But nearly all of that irritation had vanished before De Gaulle died last week at Colombey-les-Deux- Eglises ( see THE WORLD ) . <P> De Gaulle still remained something of a mystery to Americans . He claimed a grandeur , a synecdoche of self and nation ( " La France , c'est moi " ) , which in another man would have seemed monstrously totalitarian , or at least extremely eccentric . America 's last comparable hero was Dwight Eisenhower , as Kansan as De Gaulle was Cartesian , and it may be that Ike was the last man who could have said with any safety : " I am America ! " Richard Nixon would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for that matter . The U.S. has accommodated itself to a life without national heroes . De Gaulle was splendidly archaic , and in any case , as Hawthorne said , " A hero can not be a hero unless in an heroic world . "
