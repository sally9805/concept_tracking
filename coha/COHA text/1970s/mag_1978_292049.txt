A modest proposal for consumer protection <P> Many unusual propositions have been debated in U.S. state legislatures , but a new climax of sorts may have been reached in Oklahoma last week as representatives pondered the notion of a consumer protection code for sex . The idea came from Representative Cleta Deatherage , 27 , who argued vigorously that men should be required to obtain written consent from women before engaging in intercourse , and that women , before granting such consent , should receive a warning about the risks of pregnancy and the health dangers of childbirth . Her proposal was a protest amendment tacked on to an antiabortion bill before the legislature , and it paralleled sections in the proposed law that would require doctors to issue similar warnings to abortion applicants . Casanova would have reeled , and so did most of the Oklahoma representatives . They passed the anti-abortion bill 70 to 24 , but defeated Deatherage 's amendment by a solid 78 to 9.                    @
