One of the better-kept secrets in Washington has been what was said during Presidential Adviser Henry Kissinger 's recent meetings in Paris with North Viet Nam 's chief negotiators , Le Duc Tho and Xuan Thuy . But one Administration official remarked last week that Hanoi has begun to conduct " a sort of flirtation . " That is , the North Vietnamese have indicated just enough interest in a cease-fire and compromise settlement to put Administration policymakers to the task of finding a broader set of proposals that would give Hanoi " an option on the future through a process of political evolution . " <P> A translation of that line goes roughly like this : The North Vietnamese reject President Nixon 's proposal for a military settlement , involving a cease-fire in place and a unilateral U.S. withdrawal in return for the release of American prisoners of war , because that would not settle the central question-control of South Viet Nam following a ceasefire . Hanoi wants Washington to get rid of South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu as a condition for a settlement . Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. to withdraw militarily while leaving the political settlement to Saigon and Hanoi . In other words , the U.S. would be willing to leave things so that Hanoi has a fair chance of getting rid of Thieu by itself-without , however , the U.S. 's doing the North 's dirty work . <P> Thieu-Teared . One of the latest approaches is a U.S. proposal for a " two-tier " government for South Viet Nam . One Saigon government would control the non-Communist portion of the South and another would run the Communist-held parts-perhaps including all or most of Quang Tri and Binh Dinh provinces and a slice of Military Region II along the Laotian border . <P> Such a plan would presumably cover only a transitional period during which the two governments would negotiate with each other as equals - though the Communist group would in fact be Hanoi 's representatives . The plan neatly circumvents Hanoi 's refusal to talk directly with Saigon . It also meets Washington 's demand that a coalition government must not be forced upon Saigon . U.S. military aid to Saigon would probably be strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly result in the resignation of Thieu , it has been described by one Washington wag as being ' in reality a Thieu teared plan . " <P> Thieu is well aware that such proposals could lead to his eventual sacrifice . Evidently girding himself for political battles to come , he acquired emergency powers last June , and last week decreed a set of harsh new restrictions on the freedom of the South Vietnamese press . Saigon 's 27 dailies must henceforth deposit $50,000 as security against libel suits or government fines . The effect is that about half of them - and most of the opposition newspapers-will be forced to close . <P> Hanoi is certainly considering a ceasefire , as captured documents attest . They outline a plan for isolating Saigon and seizing power from a coalition government . Yet despite the fact that they stand to gain from a ceasefire , the North Vietnamese have given no indication of immediate interest .
