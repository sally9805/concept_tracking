THE ANCIENT CONTROVERSY about nature v. nurture may seem like a dusty academic parlor game . It is nothing of the sort . When an obscure professor of education at Berkeley , named Arthur Jensen , published a study in 1969 " that seemed to prove that up to 80 percent of our intelligence is determined by the genes we inherit and then related his findings to black children 's poor performance in school , various influential magazines and newspapers were quick to sense a revolution in the way Americans should think about race , education , poverty , and crime . For forty years , said Fortune magazine , " the established dogma in the social sciences has been that all people are born alike and it is environment that makes them behave differently . " This environmentalist dogma underlay most of the reform programs of the Sixties . But , said Fortune , the elimination of environmental disadvantages through compensatory education and the war on poverty has clearly not done away with differences between blacks and whites in school success , employment rates , or income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jensen 's paper in the Harvard Educational Review is reprinted with supplementary papers in Genetics and Education ( Harper &; Row , 1972 ) . He develops his thesis on race differences in Educability and Group Differences ( harper 24 &; Row , 1973 ) . impossible : the elimination of human differences that are rooted in genetic inheritance . There is , said Fortune somewhat triumphantly , a " basic intractability in human nature , a resistance to being guided and molded for improving society . " Fortune 's sister , Time , argued similarly in a series called " Second Thoughts About Man , " then wondered whether these second thoughts would n't lead to a " new quietism , a readiness to accept things as they are rather than to work for things as they might be . " The Atlantic , a magazine that usually takes its intellectual responsibilities seriously , set out to hiring this revolutionary perspective to its readers by publishing Harvard Prof. Richard Herrnstein 's skillful popularization of Jensen 's argument . " Herrnstein argued that our " meritocratic " society selects people for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , job status ? on the basis of largely inherited differences in intelligence that Jensen had apparently demonstrated . The Jensen-Herrnstein " vanguard " position " ' rests squarely on the con- * Herrnstein 's Atlantic- ankle , " IQ " ( September 1971 ) , is the basis for his recent book , IQ in the Meritocracy ( Atlantic-Little , Brown , 1973 ) . As self-styled " revolutionaries " challenging an " egalitarian orthodoxy , " the two professors signed an advertisement in American Psychologist comparing their unfriendly reception by academics and students to the attempts to suppress Galileo , Darwin , Einstein , and Mendel. cept of IQ . It draws its evidence from certain " life experiments , " notably studies of twins and adopted children , which supposedly measure the precise contribution of genes or environment to our IQ and in turn our 6i success in life .

The implications of this argument for social policy strike many people as obvious and far-reaching . Jensen and Herrnstein , for example , both seem to favor more rigorous educational tracking systems adapted to inherited differences . " The false belief in human equality , " writes Herrnstein , " leads to rigid , inflexible expectations , often doomed to frustration , thence to anger . . . we should be trying to mold our instituNormen Daniels is an assistant professor of philusuplty at Tufts University , where he teaches courses in the philosophy of science .

" He complains of " withholding educational advantages from gifted people . " Jensen has appeared before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on compensatory education programs is " lavish " and " extravagant " and one Congressman has inserted the whole of his 1969 study into the Congressional Record . In 1970 Life quoted Daniel Moynihan , then a White House adviser , as saving that " the winds of Jensen were gusting through the capital at gale force . " The 197371 ? Nixon budget proposes to demolish what is left of compensatory education programs and other programs aimed at creating educational equality . More chilling is the call by some jenscnites for the exercise of " eugenic foresight " or that of the physicist William Shockley for voluntary sterilization programs for people with lower than normal IQs . Only this past May , Jensen himself carried the ! logic of his theories to a point just shy of a call for eugenic foresight . Comparing the low birthrate of affluent ( therefore successful , therefore intelligent 1 whites with the high rate of poor ( therefore unsuccessful , I therefore unintelligent ) blacks , Jensen concluded that " dysgenics an undesirable change in the gene pool 1 with respect to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is highly probable " ( his emphasis ) . Herrnstein , in a recent Science article , demurs only that " voluntary sterilization is not a politically feasible solution . " Perhaps the most damaging effects of the IQ argument , however , will be on the expectations of teachers , college administrators , employers , and social workers who come to think of blacks and working class people as genetically less intelligent . Nobel Laureate Shockley , who has Jensen 's scholarly blessings , seems to encourage this attitude : " Nature has color-coded groups of individuals so that statistically reliable predictions of their adaptability to intellectually rewarding and effective lives can easily be made and profitably be used by the pragmatic man in the street . " IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL to Jen- sen 's and Herrnstein 's arguments that a person 's score on an IQ test does in fact indicate his intelligence . But what is intelligence ? Unfortunately , there is no generally accepted theory on the matter , an embarrassing point that our authors try to get around by asserting simply that intelligence is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said about this stance . First , it 's no way out . Scientists usually know what they are measuring and what their measuring instruments do . Second , having IQ tests does n't obviate the need for a theory of intelligence . It assumes one . IQ tests give us , says Herrnstein , a " single number measuring a person 's intellectual power . " In this view , intelligence is a single , measurable , super-capacity underlying other skills ; it is stable , " conferred " in the first fifteen years of life , and it sets a limit on what a person can learn or do . Are these assumptions warranted ? I think not . The fact that " intelligence " is a noun should n't delude us into believing that it names some single attribute we can attach a number to , like " height . " In life , we face a variety of tasks and environments . Intelligence takes many forms : a machinist suggests a new production technique , a housewife manages in spite of inflation , a hustler helps build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's behavior is will vary with time . Why should we suppose that these changes are fluctuations from some fixed , basic level ? Most important , what a person of almost any IQ can learn or do depends on what he wants to do and on what kind of education and training he is given . Jensen says high IQ is needed for high " educability , " which he defines as " the ability to learn the traditional scholastic subjects under conditions of ordinary classroom instruction " . . . and thereby innocently opens a can of worms . What conditions of " ordinary classroom instruction " ? Are social class or race biases in our schools included in these " conditions ? " Moreover , what reasons do we have to suppose that IQ tests measure " intellectual power , " an underlying capacity , rather than just achievement ? The test items themselves seem to tap specific bits of knowledge ? as in the vocabulary test ? or the acquisition of specific skills and values . On the Stanford-Binet picture test , for example , a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 " pretty " a white , prim-looking woman , and he is marked " wrong " if he picks a woman with Negroid features and slightly unkempt hair . Jensen and Herrnstein give two reasons . First , they claim that the more intelligent the child , the quicker be assimilates what 's in his environment regardless of the values that might be in the test itenis . In other words , they take precocity as a measure of capacity . But this makes sense only if the children come out of virtually identical environments ; otherwise , " precocity " will reflect only different training and exposure . And even if environments were identical ? which we know they are not ? we would still have the untested assumption that precocity in performance is a measure of capacity and not , say , motivation . Jensen and Herrnstein 's second reason for thinking IQ tests measure capacity is that IQ correlates moderately well with success in school and later job status , and these are assumed to be well correlated with intelligence . Unhappily , this argument does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that success in school or on the job is much related to intelligence . Other things , like class background , correlate even better with such achievement than IQ does . Anyway , even if IQ and intelligence were each fairly well correlated with school success , this does n't by itself mean they are correlated well or at all with each other . Finally , of course , " correlation " does not mean ' causation , " as Herrnstein occasionally suggests . Given the questionable assumptions behind IQ tests , it would be an incredible coincidence if IQ tests did indeed measure some common quality of intelligence . But I do n't think it is any accident that IQ tests have been constructed with assumptions that are so politically useful . From the start , the developers and promoters of this test technique were all convinced of hereditary , race , and class differences in intelligence . Tests that failed to confirm those assumptions were treated as failing to measure intelligence . Thus , when Sir Francis Galton devised tests that failed to show intelligence was correlated with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . not his thesis that " the average intellectual standard of the Negro is some two grades below our own . " It is no wonder that various American psychologists I Terman , Thorn-dike , Otis , Goddard , Yerkes j who believed in race and class intelligence differences were so happy when l3inet , a Frenchman , developed a handy instrument . Terman , who in 1916 developed the American version of Binet 's test , already believed that low intelligence " is very , very common among Spanish , Indian and Mexican families of the Southwest , and also many Negroes . Their dullness seems to be racial , or at least inherent in the family stocks from which they come . " lle suggested , " Children of this group should be segregated in special classes ... there is no possibility at present of convincing society that they should not be allowed to reproduce . " He argued for a major testing program : " When this is done there will be discovered enormously significant racial differences which can not be wiped out by any scheme of mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Based on early IQ tests used on Ellis Island , Goddard reported that over 80 percent of all immigrants were " feeble-minded . " IQ tests were used to justify deportations and eventually immigration quotas . IF IQ DOES NOT MEASURE intelli1 gence , then Step ( 2 ) of the IQ argument , the claim that about 80 percent of IQ differences between individuals are genetically based , loses much of its significance . But let 's look anyway at the experimental evidence for the high " heritability " estimate since it appears to be the strongest step in the IQ argument " If scientists could raise genetically * The high heritability estimate appears likely only if we ignore opposing evidence based on IQ boosting studies . Programs that " improve " the child 's environment by subjecting the children to intensive tutoring , or by coaching mothers on how to play with and read to their children , produced dramatic 15-to 30-point IQ gains which seem to be long-lasting . It is hard to see how coaching a mother an hour or so a week even scratch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and child-rearing conditions . In my own view , since low IQ is no sign of " stunted intelligence , " I think programs geared to boosting IQ , rather than leaching children something useful , are a waste of time . But by claiming that " environmentalism " is in a crisis , in spite of all this pro-environmentalist evidence , Jensen and Herrnstein seem to be attempting an unwarranted shift in the burden of proof . unrelated people in identical , laboratory controlled environments , like rats , then they could estimate " heritability " directly : all variations in IQ would be due to genes . But people are not rats , and we can not really determine when two environments are identical . To settle the " nature v. nurture " controversy , therefore , scientists are forced to turn to " life experiments " in place of lab experiments ; in particular , to cases of genetically identical people ( one-egg twins ) raised separately . For , logically , any difference in the IQs of identical twins must be due to environment . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and that of genes high . There have been four major studies of separated twins , and their results appear to give Jensen and Herrnstein considerable support . The IQs of the twins show far less variation than IQs in the population as a whole , indicating a small environmental contribution . In Sir Cyril Burt 's study of fifty-three twin pairs , fur example , IQs of twins raised separately showed rather high ( .771 ) correlations , supporting Jensen 's calculation of about 80 percent lieri tability . Jensen combines the data from all four studies since they agree in their basic results , and claim to use standard tests and procedures ; furthermore , they have been reviewed by others with no serious challenge . Finally , Jensen supplements the evidence for high heritability from the twin studies with evidence from other " life experiments . " For example , adopted children 's IQs seem to correlate better with their natural mothers ' IQs than with their adopting mothers ' . And kinship studies comparing closeness of genetic relation to similarity in IQ are compatible with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , look pretty " hard . " That 's what Professor Leon Kam-in , chairman of the Princeton Experimental Psychology Department , may have thought before he began to scratch a little at this evidence . His study gives strong reason to think the data may not be so hard after all . First , Kamin argues , it is important to see how well designed the existing " life experiments " are . If the life experiments on twins are to give an accurate estimate of the environmental contribution to IQ , it is essential that the separated twins be randomly placed in the full range of environments that a society offers . Otherwise , there will be less IQ variation than there should be and it will look as though genes contribute more than they do . Did the four studies Jensen and Herrnstein rely on really provide the full range of environments needed ? It appears not. * For one thing , the twins in all four studies either went to adoptive homes or else one member of a pair was raised at home . Adoptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their communities in economic security , cultural and educational status ; they are smaller than average , and have older than average parents . Besides , adoption agencies match children 's characteristics ( or those of the natural parents I to characteristics of the adopting family , for religion , sex , age , color and complexion , physique , medical history and family background . But there arc even more specific problems with the studies . In over half of Burt 's cases , one of the twins stayed in the natural parent 's home . In general , these twins shared similar geographical regions , similar social and religious customs ; they often played together and shared the same school system . Shields , the author of another study , claims his twins had different environments , but his report documents extensive similarities . For example , Benjamin and Ronald were " brought up in the same fruit-growing village , Ben by the parents , Ron by the grandmother . and were ... in school together . " Jessie and Winifred were " brought up within a hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same desk . " Bertram and Christopher were raised by paternal aunts " amicably living next door to one another . " * Kamin delivered a paper analyzing the existing data at a recent meeting of the Eastern Psychology Association , making most of the points I cite above . It is rather sad that Herrnstein , %Ito has constantly complained of alleged infringements on his " academic freedom " and who charges his critics with failing to consider his arguments , has resorted in a recent issue of Science to charging Kamin with being " blinded " by Marxism ( for which there seems to be no evidence ) . Presumably , Herrnstein had better be prepared to charge the whole membership of the Eastern Psychology Association since they voted by a two-to-one margin " to censure the use of inconclusive evidence concerning the heritability of IQ . " THE SMART WHITE MAN 'S BURDEN Hurt 's is the only one of the four studies that even attempts to show that the twins went into homes of differing socio-economic status . But , according to Kamin , the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly match data on the same twins published by his assistant and , in several places , fail to match data that Burt sent to Jensen . Nevertheless , in spite of these devastating problems , and in spite of the coincidental fact that Burt 's original data sheets have been conveniently destroyed , Jensen sticks to his guns . Kamin has probed another key feature of experimental design in the twin studies . To carry out an estimate fairly , it is necessary that the IQ tests be standardized with regard to sex and age . After all , one-egg twins are the same age and sex as well as being look-alikes , and it would n't be very scientific if the twins ' IQs were made to look more similar simply because they had the same age and sex . Yet the IQ tests used for Jensen 's estimate were not standardized for age and sex . Kamin has shown that the high correlations of twins ' IQs in one of the studies can be accounted for almost entirely by the failure to standardize the tests for age alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one must always try to compensate for or weed out the bias of the person doing an experiment . One needs uniform tests and testing procedures . One should make sure , for example , that each member of a twin pair was tested by a different person . Knowing the results of one twin 's IQ test might lead to biasing , even unconscious biasing , of the result on the other twin . Unfortunately for Jensen , experimenter bias is evident in the twin studies . In all but five of thirty-eight cases , Shields tested both members of a twin pair himself and found an average difference of 4.9 points , a small difference pointing to a large genetic contribution . In the five other cases , he tested one twin and his assistant the other . Here they found a 13.2-point average difference , about normal for the population as a whole and compatible with a nearly zero estimate of heritability . Shields ignores this discrepancy . Burt also apparently tested almost all the twins in his study himself so we have no way of knowing how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This factor alone should lead us to throw out more than two-thirds of the data for the four combined studies . In addition , there is some evidence that selective exclusion of data in the Shields study , as well as in Burt 's procedure of " adjusted assessments " if scores seemed too far off . operated to increase similarities in twins ' IQs . In fact , Burt did n't even administer standard tests in all cases . He admits in a footnote to giving " personal interview ? ' and " camouflaged IQ tests " and then later refers to them as " tests of the usual type . " Finally , there is an even more serious problem with the data . Burt , who may not even have used standard test procedures , nevertheless managed to find correlations that remain identical to the third decimal place in spite of sample size changes of over 100 percent ? just about a mathematical impossibility . For instance , Burt 's papers report the same .771 correlation for twins reared separately in three studies , one involving twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty " pairs ( 1958 ) , and finally fifty-three pairs ( 1966 ) . Even a college chemistry student knows better than to report data like that in his lab reports ? they 'd be thrown out as " fudged . " It might be noted that Burt , in 1909 , before any IQ data were available , remarked that his smarter subjects tended to be " blond . " The " hard data " for Jensen 's estimates has turned to mush . With regard to every crucial feature of experimental design , to say nothing of experimenter integrity , the famous twin studies fall apart . Yet these " life experiments " are the cornerstone of Jensen 's estimate of heritability . T HE THIRD STEP IN THE IQ ARGU- MENT asserts that the high 80-percent heritability of IQ for individuals can he used to explain the 15-point difference in the mean IQ of blacks and whites or the 30-point difference between the mean IQ of lower and upper classes . To go from individual to group differences is a big , in fact fatal , leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences , and in Genetics Jensen himself warns against it . But later he leaped with abandon , as when he commented in the New York Times , " The number of intelligence genes seems lower overall in the black population than in the white . " In Educability ( pages 155-156 ) , Jensen again attempts the leap from individuals to groups , this time by bamboozling the reader with a mathematical argument . Basically , using mathematical equations , he says that if heritability is high ( 80 percent ) and if IQ is well-correlated ( .5 ) with success , then mathematics tells us genes must play some role in determining success . However , he neglects to tell the reader that the " some role " genes " must " play could be completely insignificant ; it has to be only slightly more than zero . And he fails to warn the reader that his argument depends crucially on heritability being as high as he says it is . This argument hardly fools the reader familiar with mathematics and is completely unfair to the non-mathematical reader . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( social classes ) , Herrnstein tries to back away from the delicate issue of black-white differences . " We do not know why blacks bunch toward the lower end of the social scale , " he writes on page 14 . Again on page 186 , " The only proper conclusion is that we do not know whether ... racial differences in IQ are . . . more genetic , less genetic , or precisely as genetic as might seem to be implied by a heritability of .8 . " But if " bunching " blacks into the poorest section of the working class is a mechanism that can " environmentally " lower black IQs , then why does n't " bunching " most working-class people into working-class living conditions " environmentally " lower their IQs ? Herrnstein can not admit that working-class living conditions can significantly lower IQs ; that would undermine his entire thesis that class differences in IQ are highly heritable . His only way out of the dilemma is to say that working-class environments depress black IQs but not white IQs , a difficult argument to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MENT , , the " meritocracy " thesis , claims that success in life is in large part determined by high IQ . Jensen uses this step to explain why blacks , with their lower average IQs , have * Herrnstein could still say that things like " racist insults " are what depress black IQs . But does he think poor whites suffer no insults or discrimination ? low " educability " and therefore are found disproportionately in the lower end of the working class . Does " low IQ , " however , explain racist wage differentials or " last hired , first fired " policies exercised by many companies ? In 1967 , thousands of jobs were given to blacks in the auto industry following the Detroit riots . Was this higher level of " success " a result of boosted IQ ? Jensen , it seems , would have us forget all we know about economic , political , and social forces and believe instead that all along some Invisible Hand has been selecting people fur subtle , inherited differences in IQ , differences that in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( page 16 ) * But if Jensen , who thinks the white population averages out genetically superior to the black population , is still in the grip of the White Man 's Burden , then Herrnstein , whose social concern for the implications of IQ in the meritocracy is seemingly cleansed of racial overtones , is in the grip of The Smart Man 's Burden . Herrnstein reveals the onus of the Smart Man 's Burden in his famous " syllogism " : ( 1 ) If differences in mental abilities are inherited , and ( 2 ) If success requires those abilities , and ( 3 ) If earnings and prestige depend on success , ( 4 ) Then social standing ( which reflects earnings and prestige ) will be based to some extent on inherited differences among people . Herrnstein reveals the agonies of the Burden in his Atlantic lament : " As the wealth and complexity of human society grow , there will be precipitated out of the mass of humanity a low-capacity ( intellectual and otherwise ) residue that may be unable to master the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are most likely to be born to parents who have similarly failed . " A residue which , one gathers , will make huge demands on the good will and tax moneys of its betters . It is a little perplexing that * Jensen , showing an astonishing ignorance of history , says : " It is more likely ? though speculative of course ? that Negroes brought here as slaves were selected for docility and strength rather than mental ability , and that through se lective mating with slave owners ? ' the mental qualities never had a chance to flourish . " Herrnstein 's anguish is not geared toward concrete suggestions about how to ameliorate the " inevitable " situation through " effective compensatory education . " Rather , it seems geared toward preparing the " residue " to accept its fate , for he goes no further than to suggest increased use of the IQ and other tests to make possible a " more humane and tolerant grasp of human differences , " which is to say , a more rapid and rigid determination of just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to believe that high IQ is a prerequisite for success , or that there is a causal relation between IQ and " success in life " ? Herrnstein 's evidence is that IQ is a moderately good predictor of " success " and , further , that since people with high-status jobs tend to have higher average IQs , there is some reason to think high IQ is a prerequisite for performing the jobs . But other things statistically predict " success " even better than IQ , notably class background and number of school years completed . Independent of these other factors , IQ is no good at all as a predictor of " success in life . " * But is n't high IQ needed for performing high-status jobs ? Probably not . People with high-status jobs may have high average IQ , not because they have to be " smarter , " but because these jobs require educational credentials and high IQ is correlated with getting these credentials even if it is not needed for them . Herrnstein here relies on equating high IQ with high " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of evidence that this equation is totally without basis . In fact , within job categories or types , performance on jobs or " success " at the job is notoriously unrelated to IQ . Far more plausible than the thesis that getting ahead in America requires " intelligence , " as measured by IQ , is the thesis that getting ahead requires other motivational and at- * For evidence of this , see Samuel Bowles ' and Herbert Gintis 's recent study in Social Policy . One might try to save Herrnstein 's claim by arguing that IQ is a factor needed for success in school and thus indirectly fur success in life . But if class background is held constant , IQ still plays only a minimal role in predicting schoul success . And it is further arguable that it plays that role only because it measures values and attitudes and not because it measures intelligence.titudina/ traits . Competitiveness , servility ( in appropriate situations ) , and hopefulness are possible candidates , as is a considerable tolerance of boredom . Whether highly " heritable " or learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " nor do they necessarily represent the survival of the " fittest . " But even if one granted Herrnstein his " meritocracy " thesis , his conclusion does n't follow . In his syllogism , he subtly equates " high heritability " with " fixedness " or " resistance to change in all circumstances . " Even if IQ is highly heritable in our society , it does not follow that better education directed at the disadvantaged would not significantly boost mean IQs for society and make many more people " eligible " for high IQ jobs . Similarly , " high heritability " does not mean that new educational techniques wo n't be found that tend to benefit lower IQs more than higher ones , with the result that IQ differences are substantially reduced . In such a new environment , IQ might even lose its ( supposed ) high heritability . In other words , the question of " meritocracy " aside , Herrnstein makes his syllogism seem to work by giving a misleading picture of the implications of high heritability . There seems to he no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous syllogism , either its premises or its conclusion . Nor will we inevitably have to groan under the Smart Man 's Burden . Is anything left of the IQ argument , that vanguard position of the new " revolution " in the social sciences ? IQ does not measure intelligence . High heritability estimates of IQ are based on useless studies and maybe even fudged data . Anyway , these estimates can not be used to explain group differences . Finally , IQ seems to have nothing important to do with " success . " This is all that 's left of the IQ argument that Fortune , Time , Atlantic , the New York Times , and other prominent newspapers and magazines have made so famous . Will the scholarly refutations of jensenism be made as famous ? Will the press now give as much attention to showing what 's wrong with jensenism as they have given to making it nearly a household word in Washington and a guide for the " pragmatic man in the street " ?
