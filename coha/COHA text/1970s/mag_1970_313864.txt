Hamlet has obsessed the Western mind for 369 years . Why ? It is not because most people love great works of art . On the contrary , most people find great works of art oppressive , since such works invariably center on the nature of human destiny , and that destiny is tragic . Quite simply , Hamlet is a world , and like the world , it can not be ignored . Every man has lived some part of the play , and to be a man is to be inextricably involved in the play . Hamlet probes and grips the profound themes of existence-death , love , time , fidelity , friendship , family , the relationships of a man and a woman , a son and father , a mother and son , murder and madness . Above all , it probes the value of existence , man 's most anguishing question put in the form that every man knows from the time he first hears and ponders it-to be or not to be . <P> Far from being a surefire part , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the role requires a corresponding size and scope in the actor who plays it . Technique is not enough . Verbal violin play , a graceful carriage , a handsome profile-these suffice for the ordinary Hamlet . The great Hamlet is coached by life itself , schooled by life to think , listen , grow , love , hate , suffer and endure . So rigorous is this demand that in these more than 31 centuries there have been no more than a dozen great Hamlets . Everyone who is alive today has the rare and illuminating privilege of seeing one of them-Nicol Williamson . <P> Dramatic Vise . This is a filmed version of the play ( TIME , Feb. 28 , 1969 ) , and Williamson is a man of the theater in the same way that a tiger is a creature of the jungle . This means that he transcends the celluloid and holds the audience in a dramatic vise . His eyes sear the viewer . He is not speaking to the air ; he is speaking to you . As far as Williamson is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all . Never has Hamlet been rendered with more clarity or more biting timeliness , and that includes Gielgud , Olivier and Burton . Shakespeare held the mirror up to nature . Williamson holds a mirror up to the soul . <P> Two valuable aspects of the film have been contributed by Director Tony Richardson . He has cut the text by about a third , giving the production a brisk pace without mangling it . Olivier 's film never evoked " the pale cast of thought . " It made Hamlet an agile activist who , as one critic put it , was " too busy " to kill the king . Richardson has concentrated on closeups of heads . The most concrete image in Hamlet is Yorick 's skull , the symbol of mortality . The abstract image is the human brain . The existential terrain of Hamlet is the mind , vast as the earth and narrow as the tomb . By concentrating on men 's faces and skulls , Richardson has located the essential geography of Hamlet far more relevantly than if he had built some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cast is uneven , with Anthony Hopkins ' Claudius and Judy Parfitt 's Gertrude lacking sufficient force , maturity and sensuality . But Marianne Faithfull 's Ophelia is remarkably affecting . She is ethereal , vulnerable , and in some strange way purer than the infancy of truth . Yet the granitic power and sweep of the film rest with Williamson . Here are antic wit , sly , sarcastic irony , erotic longings , a sentient intelligence that lights up thought like the sun at dawn .
