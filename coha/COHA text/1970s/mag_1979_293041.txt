T.K.O. KNOCKOUT by Louis La Russo II <P> Some plays are the comic books of the theater . All of their characters are caricatures . Their situations have the labeled banality of canned clichs . The dialogue is Cro-Magnon English . In scene after scene the ludicrous and the dreadful intersect at some flash point where the playgoer 's ribs collapse in implausible laughter . <P> Knockout is just such a joker of a play . A movie in embryo and autopsy , it contains elements of every grade-Z fight picture ever made that was not worth its weight in popcorn . Give Playwright Louis La Russo II credit for knowing his Italo-American dropouts , fighters with four-letter mouths . He plants neon stickers on his key figures . The good guy ( Danny Aiello ) is Over-the-Hill . The bad guy ( Edward O'Neill ) is Below-the-Belt . There is an English Eliza Doolittle ( Margaret Warncke ) for whose favors they stage a slam-bang finale . Too bad someone forgot to throw in the towel . <P> - T.E.K.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
