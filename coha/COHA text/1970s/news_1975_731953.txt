txt For price-conscious U.S. shoppers , what happens in the next few : weeks to Thurmond Gaskill 's corn acreage in Iowa and the Gerald Lawrence wheat farm in Kansas is important . Record corn and wheat crops for the nation , which would help keep down the price of bread , corn products , eggs , milk , and corn-fed poultry , beef and hogs , depend partially on how much rain falls soon on these two farms and thousands like them . Mr. Gaskill wants some dry weather now , so that the heavy machinery he is using to plant his 400 acres of corn will not get bogged down on soggy ground . Mr. Lawrence , on the other hand , needs rain now , to bring his 900 acres of winter wheat to full maturity . Even if each gets the weather he wants , transportation and labor - costs , and export markets will affect prices also . But right now , rain ? or lack of it ? is crucial . Near Corwith , Iowa , the Gaskill family has been . working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaskill ) to finish planting their corn before more rain falls . When the ground is too wet for heavy machinery , planting stops . The longer it stops , the greater the risk that an early frost will damage the crop before harvest in the fall . Early frosts damaged corn crops in many Midwestern states last fall after planting was delayed by spring rains . Drought also hurt many crops in the ' summer . This spring , planting in most corn ' states , was running far behind schedule until early MO . Then warmer and drier weather allowed farmers to catch up . By May - 11 , the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) reports , corn planting was about one-third finished , close to normal schedule . // * Rain and food prices // Now corn farmers need more dry weather to finish the job . But Mr. Lawrence and most winter wheat farmers need rain now . " The next four weeks are critical , " he says . The 900 acres of wheat he planted last fall on his south Kansas farm need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat makes up the bulk of the U.S. wheat crop each year . The USDA estimates farmers will harvest a record 1.62 billion bushels of winter wheat this summer , 16 percent above the record of 1974 . Much of the U.S. wheat is exported each year . Unseasonably cool weather , causing wheat disease and delaying grain maturation , could cut into this bumper crop . Now , as warm weather arrives , there is greater chance the grain may " shrivel and be light weight , " says Mr. Lawrence . The price many farmers are getting for wheat is about $3 a bushel , compared to $4 and higher last fall . Farmers face inflation-bloated production costs . Because Mr. Lawrence blames the drop in corn prices paid farmers partially on predictions of big yields , he and other farmers he knows are refusing to give the federal government further information on their crop plans . ?
