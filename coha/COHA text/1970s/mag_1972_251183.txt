As seen on the home screen by an estimated 45 million viewers , the National Football League play-offs were more like playlets . Each of the four games had its own distinct plot , each its own cast of likely and unlikely heroes . <P> On the first day of Christmas the Minnesota Vikings gave the Dallas Cowboys four intercepted passes , three costly turnovers , two bonus field goals and a fumble in a careless spree . During the regular season , the Vikings boasted the stingiest defense in the league ( average points allowed per game : ten ) , but they were not able to contain the Cowboys ' explosive offense . Calling a near perfect game , Dallas Quarterback Roger Staubach mixed his pinpoint passes ( ten completions in 14 attempts ) with the slashing running of Duane Thomas to lead the Cowboys to a 20-12 victory . <P> Later that afternoon-and well into the evening-the Miami Dolphins and the Kansas City Chiefs staged their own version of The Longest Day . Led by Quarterback Bob Griese and Wide Receiver Paul Warfield , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send it into a sudden-death overtime . Sudden it was not , however , as the two teams battled on and on and on in the longest game in U.S. pro football history . Finally , after 82 min. 40 sec. , Miami won the marathon 27-24 with a sixth-period field goal . <P> Next day the Baltimore Colts stampeded over the hapless Cleveland Browns . Led by End Bubba Smith , the Colt defense blocked two field-goal attempts , intercepted three passes and smeared Brown Quarterback Bill Nelsen four times . The big difference , though , was Colt Running Back Don Nottingham , a squat ( 5 ft. 10 in. , 210 Ib. ) rookie from Kent State who was the 441st of the 442 players picked in last year 's pro football draft . Called in to replace injured Norm Bulaich , " Bowling Ball " Nottingham rolled for 92 yds. and two touchdowns as the Colts outclassed the Browns 20-3 . <P> Losing Gamble . Shortly thereafter , the San Francisco 49ers met the Washington Redskins , the team of resuscitated old pros that Coach George Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone , Allen gambled on a fourth-down-and-inches situation in the third quarter . Leading 10-3 , the Redskins went for a first down rather than for a seemingly surefire field goal . The play backfired into a 2-yd. loss . From then on it was all downhill for Allen 's Over-the-Hill Gang as 49er Quarterback John Brodie connected on two quick scoring passes . Adding another touchdown on a fourth-quarter fumble recovery in the end zone , the 49ers outlasted the Redskins 24-20.
