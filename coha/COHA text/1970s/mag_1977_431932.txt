 | Leonardo Da Vinci : A Man for All Ages " Peruse me , 0 Reader , if you find delight in my work , since ... the perseverance to pursue it and to invent such things ... is found in few people . And come , men , to see the wonders which may be discovered in nature by such studies . " LEONARDO DA VINCI , MADRID CODEX I BRAVE WORDS . Arrogant , if you like . But if any man in 15th-century Florence , or Europe for that matter , has earned the right to pen them , it is the elegant gentleman cantering up the mountain road . He rides like . a nobleman ; his short cloak swirls , his big beard blows in the breeze of his passing . Maestro Leonardo cuts a fine figure . Still , if anyone who knew him well should pass him on the trail today , he would see despair in those enigmatic eyes ? the most perceptive eyes in an age of perception . Capable of picturing the planet 's past or future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wing in flight , or of water raging against rocks . It is well that they see what ordinary eyes do not . They serve the most compulsive curiosity ever recorded . But today they are empty with remembering . Knowledge is Leonardo 's great love . Knowledge , and the experience from which it may be drawn . To acquire it , he has turned to mathematics , 296  | geometry , optics , astronomy , geology , botany , zoology , hydraulics , mechanics , anatomy . Painting ? Should not painting be first among the studies of this prodigy among the great men of art ? But , he would say , painting is science . It is based on the rationalization of sight . A most noble science , for it enables the artist to compete with nature . He is a driven man , this Leonardo : a multiple genius , flawed by an insatiable need to understand everything and , understanding , to change , to improve . Perhaps he is , as a biographer was to describe him centuries later , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others were all still asleep . " The 15th century welcomes him as an artist , but is far from ready for many of his ideas . ND NOW one of those ideas has failed him . By his own error , he has doomed his latest work ? a great mural in Florence that would have brought him the adulation he needed in his own land . The experimental paint he had devised will not dry . Looking back , he realizes that another of his great works is decaying because he has followed his own untested notions . Worse , the self-examination brought on by failure has reminded him that he , too , is destructible . His span of years is limited . How many have passed ? Fifty-three ? No time to re-create or repair the ruined works . There are too many new wonders to create ? wonders unknown to the world . At the summit he swings from the saddle and strokes the horse 's sweating neck with soft , well-tended hands that can catch the curve of an angel 's cheek or turn two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bend a horseshoe with an easy twist . Florence lies below him , long shadowed in the golden evening . The Arno glitters on its untroubled way , and villa-crowned hills cut dark designs on the haze-softened horizon . His painter 's eye catches the scene . His inventor 's mind transforms it . Only that which is fine and new would he retain : The splendid dome that soars above the city , serene curves gleaming . The tall campanile and the Baptistery , its marble rich with deep green and white . The peaceful , pleasant church of Santa Maria Novella , where incense flavors the cool air and dried priests-made-302 saints lie gape-jawed in glass caskets These places are sacred to him , not because they are Christian monuments but because they are beautiful . A mathematically minded forerunner of the Age of Reason . Leonardo loves harmony and grace , and worships logic as a god . For the rest , the artist-inventor , drawing on ideas he conceived years earlier for Milan . sees changes everywhere : The twisting streets should be as wide as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be efficient sewers and ventilated toilets , outside stairways and bay windows . He envisages a model brothel designed with an eye to discretion . Industry should be arrayed outside the town along a lock-controlled canal where waterpower would run machines to do the work of many men ? machines for lens grinding , needlemaking , metal drawing , file making , screw cutting , mirror making . There would be distilleries and sawmills and fulling mills . To build these , he has devised cranes . posthole diggers , dredges , portable bridges . pumps , pile drivers , and many ingenious tools ( pages 306-307 ) . To protect his precocious dream city , he would build terrible new weapons of his own conception : explosive shells , steam-powered cannon , rapid-fire weapons , tanks , poison gas . and artillery-proof fortifications . Weaponry fascinates him . Though he has called war " bestial madness , " he serves its ends and its practitioners . But few of his plans or devices have interested the princes of the day . Now , aging , he sees his dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology will stay undiscovered in his cabinet , to be re-created in another age . Disconsolate , he feels that he must shake the world with a prodigious feat . Even though he recognizes his own superlative skill as an artist , this brilliant , farsighted man has never understood that his paintings alone will make him a giant among geniuses , known to hundreds of millions across uncounted centuries and in lands yet undiscovered . No , his feat must be conceived in science , based on mathematics ( the only absolute truth ) , and realized through engineering : He will fly . For years he has studied the flight of birds and the movements of the air , and has designed several flying machines . National Geographic , September 1977 Every fi entist , al perhum ; suddenlF umph tl As dh Ceceri-noteboo " the gre the bacl world w Leonard  | Every facet of his multiple being ? artist , scientist , aesthete , observer ? yearns for this superhuman adventure . Longing for success , he suddenly assumes in a rush of premature triumph that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Monte Ceceri ? Swan Mountain ? he writes in a notebook filled with phrases and sketches : " the great bird will take its first flight upon the back of the great swan , filling the whole world with amazement and filling all records with its fame ; and it will bring eternal glory to the nest where it was born . " For a moment , before leaving , he watches with passionate longing the slow circling of hawks and the swallows ' supple turning . A legend says that in this time , around 1505 , the great bird rose from Swan Mountain and flew . The artist 's loquacious notes tell us nothing ; no other witness deposes . But some 50 years later an acquaintance wrote : " Leonardo  | da Vinci also attempted to fly , but failed . He was an excellent painter . " To call Leonardo an excellent painter is like labeling Shakespeare a clever wordsmith . He was a true genius , recognized in his own time and idolized in ours . His paintings are as secret and seductive as himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect of a scientist , and the soul of a romantic . His drawings ? some of them ? are among the most beautiful ever made . As an engineer , he could think in four dimensions , visualizing not only the shapes of mechanical parts but also their interrelated motions ? and create things that no one yet wanted . In some ways the first modern , Leonardo @# was in many more the personification of his own incomparable time . Like the spirit of the Renaissance itself , the mind of this man destined to become its living symbol was fashioned in the quickening spring of the Western world 's awakening from the shriveling darkness of the Middle Ages . He was free , as few human beings have ever been free , to become whatever his gifts might make of him . BORN IN 1452 , love child of a peasant girl named Caterina and the respected notary Piero da Vinci , Leonardo lived at first with his mother in a three-room stone house , astraddle a hill just outside the village of Vinci ( pages 298-9 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that enchanted Tuscan countryside began the youngster 's lifelong love of nature , of all that moved or grew or was ? the deepest love he would ever know . Towheaded , blue-eyed , open-faced , driven by a curiosity that brought him often to the edge of fear , he roamed the tamed , terraced slopes , where lizards rustled in warm leaves under the laden vines and gusts turned olive groves to rippling silver . There were forbidding forests on the high peaks , and everywhere cypresses , like single brushstrokes , marked the mild horizon . Ser Piero 's wife having proved barren , and his bastard beautiful , he took the boy from Caterina and installed him in his own house . Here Leonardo acquired a modest education and , on at least one occasion , a number of small dead animals , which he drew with remarkable skill as they reeked and rotted on his table . The practical Ser Piero is said to have suffered the stench and sold the painting . Around 1469 Leonardo 's father took him to Florence , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de ' Medici was establishing an aristocracy of literate intellectuals and all arts were honored. * There were painters here ? the world 's best ? turning at least part of their talents to the representation of things as they were rather than as the grim Gothic Church for so long had said they must be , and so making art a branch of knowledge rather than an instrument of religious expression . In the liberal land of the Medici , the princes of the church had grown  | knowledgeable and hence moderate . The threat of the Inquisition still lay decades ahead . In the tolerant atmosphere of Florence , a man could pursue any course if he did so with grace . No society could so well have suited the gifted , undisciplined country boy ; most would have destroyed him . Leonardo was apprenticed to Andrea del Verrocchio , a kindly , competent man who ran a shop that produced anything from jewel settings to altar paintings . He stayed with him for at least six years . The boy mastered every medium and continued his studies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him that everything must eventually be revealed to his searching mind . In his exuberant confidence , he seems to have felt no need for the religious nurture of the church or the comfort of human love . HE OUTSHONE his fellow pupils in every skill and proved himself more able than his master with a brush . Assigned to paint the figure of a kneeling angel in a baptism of Christ by Verrocchio , he gave it a whole new dimension that seemed to draw the spectator directly into the painting , in a way that his teacher 's stiff style could never do ( page 304 ) . Some say that Verrocchio never painted again .  | But the boy also differed from his associates in other , less commendable ways . His master soon discovered that he was capricious , quick to boredom , and conscienceless when it came to completing a job . In 1476 Leonardo and three others were anonymously charged with being homosexuals . They were tried ? twice ? and acquitted . But Leonardo became withdrawn and secretive and assumed an alabaster mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone . He left Verrocchio 's studio to live alone , and for a time attempted no Work of art . In 1472 , when he was 20 , he had been @# accepted into the guild of painters , allowing him to seek independent commissions . But not until 1478 does the first record of such a commission appear . He contracted to paint a chapel altarpiece in the Palazzo Vecchio , probably a nativity scene , as indicated by many of his sketches that year . There is no evidence that the painting was ever begun . But his 1478 sketches , exuberant and lively , perhaps led him to develop the idea for the " Adoration of the Magi , " for which he was to receive a commission in 1481 . Ambitious beyond fulfillment , it was a big picture , dark , and crowded with figures which ( to quote Kenneth Clark 's fine phrase ) " vanish and T- "  | reappear , like fish in a muddy pool . " Seething with emotion and motion , a display of disciplined intelligence and a fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother lode of forms and fancies from which he would draw the rest of his life . Characteristically , Leonardo left the work unfinished . And , unfinished , uncolored , it is superb . Generations of painters , critics , and less learned admirers of art have marveled at its power and beauty . Had the young painter learned from this work the evocative force of half-expressed suggestion , he could have considered the painting finished and become more prolific . But his scientific bent , evident in this extraordinary painting , required that a completed work must present total detail within a condot-h-century ieticulous specially lus .

To finish the " Adoration " in such a way could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the young artist was still collaborating with Verrocchio . For a Pistoia Cathedral altarpiece commissioned that year , Leonardo may have painted the " Annunciation " on the pedestal , similar to a large painting that now hangs in the Uffizi Gallery ( pages 310-11 ) . The Uffizi work long was considered to be his earliest painting , dating from 1472 , but recent scholarship has redated it six years later. * It , too , is an ambitious painting , rendered in intense , clear colors , *A principal consultant for this article was Carlo Pedretti , professor of art history at UCLA , whose extensive scholarship on Leonardo includes special attention to dating his works , with a perspective stressed beyond mathematical correctness . The twilight background and the flowering foreground are surely labors of love ? the young artist 's tribute to the natural world . Virgin and angel have the lifeless look of mythical creatures become standard symbols . LEONARDO left Florence in 1482 at the age of 30 . He stayed away for 18 years . The young Florentine hoped to find the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurper of Milan . A practical city , Milan cared more for knowledge than for the arts . It housed no great artists but counted many learned men . Leonardo came as a musician , bringing as a gift from Lorenzo de ' Medici  | a silver lyre of the artist 's own design . He also presented himself as an engineer , describing in a long boastful letter his inventiveness in the field of weapons . Almost as a postscript he prudently added , " also I can do in painting whatever may be done , as well as any other , whoever he may be . " It was as an artist that Leonardo was accepted . He established an art factory much like Verrocchio 's shop in Florence and at once accepted assignments . One , an altarpiece for a convent , was still unfinished and still the subject of a lawsuit 20 years later . This was his " Virgin of the Rocks , " begun in 1483 and now in the Louvre . It is a work that retains a Florentine sense of brilliant color and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a background of rocks , water , and vegetation . A more rewarding commission , a portrait of Lodovico 's beautiful and learned mistress , Cecilia Gallerani ( page 314 ) , he completed with commendable speed , as he did the likeness of a musician . GRACIOUS PERSON , pleasing if not loving , a singer , versifier , maker of marvelous illusions , he was both performer and showman . He devised puzzles and games , and jokes that made people " roar with laughter . " He won the friendship of dukes and kings . Admirers called him " the Divine Leonardo " and said he could do anything . Around 1485 he began his notebooks . These are voluminous , cryptic compilations of material on everything that took his fickle fancy : geology , geometry , anatomy , astronomy , architecture , flight , studies for paintings , personal accounts , platitudes , word puzzles , all interwoven and superimposed as one burning interest gave way to the next . His notes are written left-handed from right to left , and there are sketches everywhere that complement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , and so he has left us an extraordinary record of the movements of his mind . A decade later he taught himself Latin , a second language to the learned classes but not part of the curriculum of young artisans ? which included painters . His later notebooks reflect the recorded wisdom of Greece and Rome , as well as of the Middle Ages . The duality of Leonardo 's nature grew more pronounced in the indolent atmosphere  | of Milan . He spoke scathingly of war , but offered to serve it with imaginative ideas for murderous devices . He treated friends with kindness , but enjoyed drawing hideous grotesques . He declaimed against the taking of life , but watched hangings and sketched the wry-necked victims . In architecture he played with city planning , but worked on fortresses or on the evanescent decor of festivals . But perhaps more frustrating to the man himself was the conflict between his intensely powerful intellect , which drove him to mindwasting exercises in geometry ( and held that nothing that is not mathematically demonstrable could be true ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth in beauty . Anatomy became a passion . Quite naturally he wanted to explore the human body in order to represent it perfectly . Other Renaissance painters studied corpses to perfect their depictions of the human form . But Leonardo 's scientific bent led him beyond mere art to a reveling in the exquisite mechanics of musclearticulated bone . IN MILAN , Salai , a lovely lad with curly blond hair and the disposition of a weasel. became part of Leonardo 's household . The artist took the child in as servant and pupil , clothed , fed , pampered , and drew him . Salai 's pretty features appear in the languid , androgynous faces of boyish virgins and girlish saints . As usual , where personal matters are concerned , Leonardo 's profuse prose reveals nothing of his feelings . " Salai stole the money , " he writes coldly . And , " thievish , lying , obstinate , glutton . " Again his pictures are his only statements of emotion ; he drew Salai with love . Along with his varied duties at court , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonardo 's years with Sforza . One was to be a bronze statue of the duke 's late father as a conquering hero astride a charger . The other , ordered by Sforza for his favorite church , was a " Last Supper . " They were banal themes , like most commissions of princes and priors , but if the subjects lacked originality , their treatment did not . The horse was to be colossal , in a pose full of motion and life . The concept was so bold , so ambitious , that it brought the artist the praise he craved , but his contemporaries , including Michelangelo , thought it could not  | be cast . But Leonardo , an expert foundryman , had devised workable plans ( page 318 ) that came to light in a collection of notes known as the Madrid Codices , found only a decade ago . Before his project could be executed , war broke out and bronze destined for the horse became cannon instead . He did turn out a full-scale clay model of a riderless horse . It survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French soldiers who occupied the city after Lodovico 's defeat " broke it all to pieces . " The " Last Supper , " too , was presented as never before . Where other painters portrayed the Apostles in pensive mood , deployed as individuals around the table with Judas generally on the near side , Leonardo interrelated the 13 figures in a brilliant composition reflecting the terrible moment following the words , " One of you shall betray me . " He endowed them with deep emotions , varying according to their natures , and he observed to perfection his own admonition to show by motion the intention of each subject 's soul . Like the horse , the " Last Supper " had begun to deteriorate alarmingly in Leonardo 's own lifetime because of a curious lack of foresight . Leonardo hated deadlines and fixed schedules . Painting alfresco ( that is , on freshly prepared plaster ) imposed both . So he worked with oil mixtures , which could be applied whenever the mood struck him . A contemporary description tells much about that mood . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .. . the Last Supper ... there he would stay from sunrise to darkness , never laying down the brush , but continuing to paint without eating or drinking . Then three or four days would pass without his touching the work , yet each day he would spend several hours examining it and criticizing the figures .... I have also seen him .. . leave the Corte Vecchia when he was at work on the stupendous horse ... and go straight to the Grazie . There . . . he would take a brush and give a few touches to one of the figures : and then suddenly he would leave .... " The technique suited the artist , but not the wall . The paint soon blistered and began to scale from the damp surface ( following pages ) . Within a few decades retouchers were at work , compounding the damage of decay . With his doomed masterworks behind him , Leonardo turned to defense planning as Louis XII and his French army approached Milan . The defenses were inadequate . Lodovico fled , but later was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 years , the court painter noted , " the Duke has lost his state , his possessions , and his liberty , and he has seen none of his works finished . " Leonardo shed no tear but , putting patron above patriotism , set out to win the friendship of yesterday 's enemies ? today 's friends ? the French . This done , he left Milan . In the spring of 1500 he was back in Florence . LEONARDO CAME HO1IE a famous man . No one knew or cared much about his science and his inventions , but everyone had heard of his horse and his " Last Supper . " Still , in a Florence turned republican and pious in the wake of intellectual Medici rule , he could not be the pampered prince of painters he had been in Milan . He would have to compete to prove himself again . His competition had dwindled . Many of the fine old hands had died or gone to Rome . His most serious rival was Michelangelo Buonarroti , 23 years his junior , surly , pious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florentines hated each other wholeheartedly . As if to gain local credit , Leonardo accepted a commission from the Servite Brothers and soon produced a cartoon , or preliminary sketch , " which not only filled every artist with wonder , but . . . men and women , young and old , flocked to see it for two days , as if it had been a festival , and they marveled exceedingly . " With good reason . It was a serene and enchanting picture of St. Anne with the Virgin and Child ( page 327 ) , basis for a later painting considered one of the artist 's greatest works . With its subtly heretical suggestion of pagan goddesses and its intrinsic beauty , it was also a slap at the followers of the hatepoisoned monk Savonarola , whose perverted preaching of divine vengeance had roused the city 's rabble to stone works of art , distrust beauty , and fear what it could not understand . Leonardo considered God a creator rather than a destroyer . His reputation reestablished , the master resumed his dilatory ways . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the altar panel for which it had been made , but returned to his studies . An acquaintance 321  | wrote : " ... he is entirely wrapped up in geometry and ca n't stand the sight of a brush . " Restless again , perhaps longing for the protection of a powerful prince , Leonardo joined Cesare Borgia , the arch-criminal of the age , as a military engineer and cartographer . His maps were not only numerous and beautiful but , because he based them on modern surveying methods , among the most accurate then known . He produced one of the first world maps making reference to America . Cesare Borgia , perjured priest and son of a priest , was an intelligent , treacherous killer with a pragmatist 's interest in things that work . The effete artist found him fascinating . That Cesare served his father , the Pope ( and his own ruthless greed ) , sadistically and without honor , that his senseless campaign posed a potential threat to Florence , bothered Leonardo not at all . AFTER SEVERAL stimulating months Leonardo came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of artist by Borgia 's defeat . Perhaps a little guiltily he plunged into unaccustomed productivity , mostly planning and correcting the work of younger painters . Once again two great works drew most of his artistic effort . One was a huge mural for the Council Chamber depicting the " Battle of Anghiari " ( pages 324-5 ) , militarily a foolish little fracas in  | which one man was killed falling off his horse , but politically an important victory for Florence . The other was a life-size portrait of a middle-class woman a bit past her prime . Some say the lady is Lisa , wife of Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo . Others suggest different identities . Perhaps she is no one of this earth , but a creature formed in fascination and fear in Leonardo 's mysterious mind . He worked on the picture for most of four years , and it was with him always . Surely anyone who had commissioned the work would have taken and treasured it . It may have pleased Leonardo to start with an inauspicious subject once again and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be war with all the bestial frenzy he had observed along Borgia 's bloody trail . The quiet lady would be as enigmatic as he himself . Her picture would be the portrait , capturing in paint a living or imagined individual in a perfect likeness . He worked on the two paintings alternately . The battle scene thrust Leonardo into an artistic feud with Michelangelo , who was to paint another wall of the same chamber . The younger man 's picture of male bathers interrupted by a call to arms was as captivating as Leonardo 's cavalry confrontation , and he used a Renaissance beefcake style that Leonardo despised , putting tensely bulging muscles on every figure ? recumbentor active . The rivals did their cartoons in separate quarters . Both were magnificent in their way . Benvenuto Cellini , who saw them both , wrote that , while these two cartoons were intact , " they were the school of the world . " The portrait offered Leonardo pleasant relief from the subject and circumstances of the battle . Surrounding his sitter with lutists , singers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melancholy which painting usually gives to portraits , " the maestro worked comfortably and carefully to make a picture that would appear to live . It is said that in its original state it did . It is a dark picture , a disturbing mirror of an unfathomable mind and a cool heart . But it presented a form of perfection , founded a dynasty of portraitists , and became the most famous painting in the world ( page 315 ) . It hangs in the Louvre , glass shrouded and @#  | guarded . Its colors have suffered a strange change as if bathed in undersea light , but the lady still glows with an inner radiance . She is both troubling and serene ? ultimate proof of her creator 's ability to work near miracles by rivaling nature , his own definition of the artist 's goal , the capturing of a beauty , as 19th-century critic Walter Pater described it , " wrought out from within upon the flesh .... " @# IN THIS TIME Leonardo also made many sketches for a painting , since lost , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coyly bent body and a smile of secret complicity . It is a curious theme for a man without any apparent sexual interest in women , beautifully executed , but chilling in its lack of sensuality . Michelangelo never transferred his cartoon to the Council Chamber wall . Leonardo did , or at least , he began to . Forgetting the fate of his " Last Supper " ( or perhaps not yet aware of it ) , he again used an oil paint for greater freedom and brighter hues . It is said that he was inspired by a painting method described by Pliny the Elder more than 14 centuries before . Leonardo 's use of oil worked well enough on the trial panel ? the small original painting ? but on the wall itself the paint soon began to flake and run . The work was doomed , another masterpiece lost . Heartsick , beaten , he did what he usually did in the face of defeat : He turned from art to one of his many other fields of interest . In this case , his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His knowledge grew beyond the limits of his time and approached the understanding that much later gave men wings . There is the single reference to an attempt that failed . Be that as it may , his efforts brought him no satisfaction , only the certainty that he himself would never fly or witness manned flight . One great failure had followed another . Leonardo could not bear to remain on the scene of his humiliation . With the Florentine Council 's permission , he left to spend three @# months in Milan , entering the service of the French governor . He took the " Mona Lisawith him , and his notebooks , and Salai . The French treated Leonardo with more consideration than had his compatriots . With the help of the king 's regent and later the French king himself , he extended his threemonth stay to seven years , during which he returned only briefly to Florence and did nothing whatever to complete the " Battle of Anghiari " ( for which he had received payments ) . The city of the Renaissance had little left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its child and its champion . In Milan he joined Ambrogio de Predis to produce a second version of the " Virgin of the Rocks . " Then the master turned his brooding mind to studies so profound as to answer questions yet unasked . He became even more engrossed in his anatomical studies , viewing man as a machine and a work of art . He would disclose all the secrets of the body by combining science and art to create a work beyond the capacity of any other human being . The treatise would be the greatest accomplishment of his life . SOME OF HIS DRAWINGS were both beautiful and precise and did , indeed . present new knowledge . Then , he turned to the stars and from their lofty perspective looked down with disdain upon the mortal mechanism that is man . In his celestial enchantment he came to question the Biblical age of the earth , the account of the Flood , and to view the earth as a living organism , likening its rivers to the flow of blood . This was dangerous thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all things and the result of recent and special creation . In an age in which such ponderings might fall under the definition of heresy . Leonardo confided them only to his notebooks . So he lived on ? a sage , skillful old man ? tolerated and sometimes applauded . When Rome attacked in 1513 and drove out his friends the French , he left , too ? for Rome . National Geographic , September 1977 Lei  | There was a new Pope now , Leo X , a Medici and a decent , intelligent man . There were plenty of commissions for great artists , and Michelangelo and young Raphael were doing very well filling the Vatican with pictures . Leonardo got no major commissions but perhaps found time to apply the finishing touches to a painting begun years before in Milan : a beautifully rendered , disagreeable picture of St. John the Baptist that tough old desert wanderer ? as a doe-eyed hermaphrodite . He was well housed , thanks to Pope Leo 's brother Giuliano , with whom he devised all sorts of bizarre experiments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and the Pope 's German artisans insulted him Three years later Giuliano died , and Leonardo set out on the last journey of his homeless life . Once again his reputation had done for him what his talents could not always do . Young Francis I , France 's new king , regarded Leonardo as a legendary figure and wanted him nearby whether he painted or not . He was housed in the cheerful small Chateau of Cloux in a pastel landscape near the quiet Loire . Still the maestro , Leonardo had with him Salai , who soon left , the devoted Francesco Melzi ( a pupil from the Milanese years ) . an old serving woman , and three pictures . On one or another he painted occasionally or  | directed the work of other artists . He gave increasing attention to architectural planning and the king 's idea of a new royal residence at Romorantin , which embodied many concepts that would appear at Versailles a century later . For the rest , the old gentleman did little but talk with Francis , who galloped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonardo the wisest of men . In his heart Leonardo felt defeat . He sensed the coming of death with desperation , knowing that now he would never finish the works on which he was engaged or , more important , carry out the many wondrous projects that forever filled his extraordinary mind ? that @# his consuming thirst for understanding would never be quenched . In his distress he would think back on a philosophical doodle , a row of blocks , each pushing the next down , whereon he had written : " By these square blocks are meant the life and the states of men . " Dying , his greatest works crumbling , his great knowledge undisclosed , he grieved for what might have been . No spark of the old arrogance returned to suggest to him that the few magnificent works he left would alone suffice to make his name immortal . And so the universal man ? symbol of his time and anticipator of ours ? passed with unaccustomed humility into eternal fame . 329           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
