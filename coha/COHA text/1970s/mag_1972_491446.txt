// Just before noon one day not so long ago , we lay on a beach on the west coast of Maui and pondered a paradox : how to enjoy Hawaii . The day was bright and glowing , almost hot to the touch . Behind us , the warm mists came tumbling down the cloud-wreath mountains into the raw-cut ravines , as if they were eager to be cradled there . Before us , a mile or so at sea , several whales were cavorting in the waves , leaping and jumping and playing as children would play . We had to extend ourselves to remember that there were people who were confused by  --  or disappointed in  --  the reality that is the deep and inexhaustible legacy of Hawaii . " It ... it seems so different than we dreamed , " said the sun-leathered man sitting by us on the beach near the hotel . He passed a well-worn hand over his thinning grey hair . His movements , like his words , were economical and his clothes were as quiet and restrained as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if to apologize for his height . He and his wife had come here , after a long pause in Waikiki , on a long-saved-for vacation from the vast fertile prairies astride the Mississippi  --  lightdrenched in summer , grandly desolate in winter  --  where people spend their lifetimes raising dreams from the dust around them . " I 'm not sure what we expected , but Hawaii seems so . . . so organized , " he said . So it does . It is beautiful . And often serene . But it is no longer wild , isolated and remote  --  a distant dream of an untrammeled paradise . It is not a non-civilization but a civilization of a different sort . The secret of enjoying Hawaii is in organizing the dream itself . This is a departure from the past . For a century or more , Hawaii was the undisciplined dream of an undisciplined life to literally tens of millions of Americans : Mark Twain himself described it as " the loveliest fleet of islands that lies anchored in any ocean . " In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place where the visitor could find surcease from the kind of civilization and pressures he knew at home . It conjured up images of a sun-swept beach and a " little grass shack " where brown-skinned girls in grass skirts did the hula and where smiling brown-skinned men waved palm fronds over your head . The beaches are still there , but little else . For Hawaii is no longer the simple place of the dreams of yesteryear . It is many-dimensioned and multifaceted : it is placid , majestic ; simple , sophisticated ; modern , archaic : rural , urban . It is more fascinating than ever before , but it does not respond to the simple dream . It demands to be treated as a many-hued reality that appeals to the deepening moods and often the exaltation of man . That 's how we went about it when we visited the Islands recently . We knew there had been changes in Hawaii : any place that receives two million visitors a year and has one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States is bound to experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . We learned of one college professor who is so distraught over the rapid rate of change in Honolulu that he bought some land on a more remote Pacific island  --  his paradise-to-be  --  and , by way of preparing to move there , he and his wife have already had their appendixes and gallbladders removed and all their teeth pulled so that , when they flee to paradise , they wo n't need doctors or dentists , or anybody else . One can despair in the change . Or exult in it . For in change there 's been growth . It is as if seeing a favorite child grow up : he becomes more complex , more delightful , more exasperating , more fulfilling . We firmly concluded that the reward of visiting Hawaii today is in fitting your dream to the change  --  and the growth  --  of Hawaii . The simplest , most direct way of organizing the dream is to match Hawaii 's mood to your own . For a serene refuge and a retreat , you 'd hardly go to Waikiki ; you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you wanted to indulge in the more strenuous outdoor sports , you would n't hole up in Honolulu ; you 'd go to the " big island " of Hawaii for deep-sea fishing , or to the folded reaches of the dormant volcano , Mauna Kea , to hunt mountain goat , bighorn sheep , or wild boar ( the latter should , by local tradition , be taken by hand  --  with a knife  --  instead of being shot at a distance ) . And if you want to know some of the whimsy and treachery of Hawaiian seas , you 'd sit by the bar in Hilo and browse through the local phone book , which is perhaps the only phone book in the world that has several pages devoted not to what to do in response to an air-raid warning but what to do in case of a tsunami warning . A tidal wave . Understand the dream as it is , not as it was . Some twenty-five or thirty years ago , for example , Waikiki was a leisurely little community of white sand beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hotels  --  comfortable , rambling structures whose leisurely spirit matched that of life on the beach itself . Today . Waikiki is a hus-tling , bustling place with a four-lane highway  --  one-way , with speed-timed stoplights -- and some of the most exotic contradictions in the world : elegant specialty shops stand-ing hard by open-air fast-food stands where you can get hot buttered corn-on-the-cob ; highly styl-ized night clubs standing hard by all-you-can-eat places . You can stand on the balcony of your hotel room and look up along the beach to the vast , violet hulk of Diamond Head and see literally scores of high-rise hotels and condominiums glis-tening in the sun . The change is not only on the land but in it . And in its cost : in contrast with what it once cost to build a little grass shack , land in Waikiki has been priced as high as $6 million an acre . But it is , nevertheless , a special kind of opportunity for the mood that matches it : here one can experience the best-of-the-bazaar  --  the heightened pace of urban living  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . Even within that context , the rhythms and tensions of Waikiki may surprise you . ( " I did n't know Hawaii was so busy ! " said our son when he first saw Waikiki . ) The sidewalks are never completely empty except in the wee hours of the morning , and the range of urban experience is akin to that of many mainland cities . Beside an elegant flower shop you 'll find a peep show that not only sells seats but roles in the show ( " New roles every week-250 a show " ) . At night , the streets are filled not only with sightseers but with those selling a point of view : " Ye-ew dew not have to die ! " cries a street-corner evangelist , standing outside a wax museum which memorializes people who 've already done so . There are those who see it as something less than an American Original . " Oh , it 's just like Miami Beach  --  **25;3403;TOOLONG , " we were told . " It 's just another commercial business strip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other such commercial strips . And there is a decided disposition not to let the standards of dress slide ( " No sloppy clothes/No T-Shirts with weird slogans , " warns a sign in a Japanese-run restaurant ) . And it has a greater range , an easier flexibility , in its culture-within-aculture : its International Market Place is one of those areas that looks somber , strange , ceremonious  --  all dark woods and colored lanterns  --  and that offers everything from expensive jewelry to inexpensive sketch artistry , from exotic night clubs to candy butchers . The thing about Waikiki is that , with all its commercial hustle-and-bustle , it still has the grace of being itself . It boasts a local culture : the affluent-looking , bare-chested man of middle years  --  an Ernie Kovacs without the cigar  --  who swaggers triumphantly along the sidewalk , deep in earnest conversation with a yellow-headed macaw perched on his shoulder . It has something of a universal culture : the silent old men who sit under an awning and play chess together on a stone table by the sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intangible culture of the past : the warmth , the largess , the fleeting generosity that was the Hawaii of Yesteryear . Honolulu and all of the island of Oahu invite exploration : they are part of an urban setting of which Waikiki is a special kind of experience . Oahu means , after all , the " gathering place , " and it is literally the epicenter of the vast civilization of the Pacific rim . It has made Honolulu not only metropolitan but cosmopolitan : it is Oriental , it is Polynesian , it is American . One can take a brief walk through a culture-withina-culture in Honolulu and come across the gilded opulence of a Kyoto temple , the shadowy ramble of Hong Kong , the stern missionary splendor of old Hawaii . The signs of this multi-culture can not be mistaken  --  or evaded : the room directions in the hotels and the " men " and " women " signs on the rest-room doors are in the gentle calligraphy of Japan as well as the bold Anglo-Saxon strokes of the mainland ; even the menus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as English . ( Japanese has become the second language here  --  much as Spanish is the second language in Miami and New York  --  because Japan has staged a successful invasion of Hawaii .. by tourists . The number of visitors from Japan , in this generation-after-Pearl Harbor , is second only to the number of tourists coming from mainland America . ) Beyond all this , Honolulu boasts a grace and style and ease of living that is unmatched by any of the other great cities of the nation . Its streets are wide and clean and only sporadically , and briefly , clogged with traffic . And its parks are laced with the bright colors and warm odors of jacaranda and bougainvillea and orchids . It has a variety of cultural thrusts : opera in a magnificent setting , theater of considerable di : versity ( Waiting for Godor by Nobel prize-winning author Samuel Beckett while we were there ) , and a university with 22,000 students and some of the most eclectic and far-ranging studies in academia ( i.e. , " Futuristics , " the detailed study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projections  --  and their impact on people and on populations ) . It has , as does any great city , certain internal strains but it manages to handle or to sublimate them : the racial tensions of the mainland have touched Hawaii but in an unlikely manner -- not simply as a black-vs. - white issue but as a feeling running through the brown and the yellow as well as the white peoples . And yet the monstrous torment of racial conflict in mainland America is not so pervasive in Hawaii , perhaps because of the inherent courtesy and sense of discretion of the Polynesian and Oriental people . There is another aspect to Honolulu 's life-style that affects both visitor and resident : it 's an early-morning town . " I leave the house around 7:30 in the morning , " says Bill Bachran , a communications specialist who 's lived in Hawaii for the last twenty-five years , " and I drop off the kids at school before their first class at 7:45 and I 'm in the office by 8 o'clock . " That 's all very punctilious , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Bachran 's cohorts says ? " Bill 's a little late , getting in to work in late morning , instead of with the rest of us . " The lines start forming outside of the breakfast rooms on Waikiki before 8 o'clock in the morning . And the first tour buses of the day  --  sometimes the only ones  --  are on their way by 9 o'clock . In the end , it is the urban diversity of Honolulu that gives it a special distinction . It has a variety of eating experiences , everything from steak done in a Slavic manner to the Royal Spaghetti House in downtown Honolulu . ( The Sheraton hotels , which have fourteen restaurants in their locations at Waikiki , have a special cross-billing system so that you can dine at any of them and get  --  if not a variety of costs  --  at least that variety of eating experiences . ) It has a choice of shopping experiences : if you 're apprehensive about getting stung with " Waikiki prices , " you might shop instead at the Ala Moana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops , including the largest Sears Roebuck in the world-and it can be reached by any of seventeen bus routes that run through and around Hono- lulu , as well as by special taxis that have stands in certain locations ( including Waikiki ) . It has a choice of sightseeing experiences : you can indulge yourself with the centuries-old culture of the Polynesian village or the undersea culture of Sea Life park ( or the glass-bottomed-boat ride ) and ultimately the historic moment of Pearl Harbor , The latter is not only memorable for its history but for its costs . A sightseeing tour aboard a commercial boat costs $7 for adults ( $17.50 for our family of three ) plus the costs of get-ling to the boat . The navy runs a free cruise through the base , but reservations must be made many , many weeks in advance- particularly in the busy season ( off season , you may be lucky to get a place on the day you show up at the Ilarbor ) . The navy also runs a free shuttle service to the USS Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six not allowed , nor is the more garish and abbreviated beachwear permitted ) . But again you 've got to get to the dock on your own either via connecting bus rides - at least two different lines  --  or via a taxi ride that 'll cost upwards of $20 round trip . The costs of the taxi make renting a car a viable alternative . It 'll cost around $8 a day , sometimes with a discount or 125 miles ' worth of free mileage thrown in . That can be significant:the cost of living is quite high in I lawaii . United Air Lines gives employees transferred from the Mainland a 10-percent cost-of-living allowance when they move to Hawaii . Gasoline reflects some of that cost : it runs fifty to fifty-five cents a gallon in many locations . There are a good many " deals " available in rent-acar opportunities weekly rates , compact car rates , manual-shift vs. automatic-shift rates . The manual-shift cars run about $1 a day less than the automatic-shift cars . But do n't get too beguiled by the $1-a-day deal ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs eleven cents a mile and you 've got a fiftymile-a-day minimum ( which means $5.50 added , whether or not you move the car ) plus gas and insurance . But you can organize economy , even in the renting of a car . Your local insurance agent can arrange extended coverage for your driving in Hawaii . As we were leaving the hotel in Waikiki , we chatted with our bellhop , a young man from Lansing , Michigan , who 'd been in Hawaii only a matter of months . He said it was about time for him to take a vacation- " to get away from this rat race . " Where would he go ? " To Maui , " he said . " I 'm going down to the west coast of Maui . " That 's what we did . And we found that he was right . Maui is as different from Waikiki as sun from shadow . It is a place of broad , gleaming beaches , empty coves , hot sun , and talk when it is a time for talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottages of Kaanapali and in the distance white sails tip and tilt in the trade winds . And from time to time one can see a yachtsman anchor his boat offshore and arrive on the beach in the high style of Maui : he surfs-not rows-in for dinner in a dinner jacket and " evening " shorts . In brief , Maui is a dramatic change from the urban , commercial concept of Hawaii , a refuge for those who 've tired of the urban scene and come to Hawaii for release and surcease . This is not to say that Maui is n't organized . The opposite is the fact : Maui has even designed a long-term growth program that will permit the controlled change , and expansion , of life on the island so that commercialism can be kept subdued and the natural beauty of the island preserved . That beauty is breathtaking . From almost anywhere in Maui you can see the clouds playing among the mountaintops and rolling like great billows of steam down green-shrouded crevasses laced with waterfalls . Those mountains divide Maui-as with most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to be wet and rainswept ; the clouds seen atop the peaks have been caught and impaled there before they could dump their rain burden on the leeward side . Since the winds swept in from the mainland side of the islands , we chose the west , or leeward , side . It was called Kaanapali Beach and it is a resort area of the most exquisite kind . It is a place of close-cropped lawns , a confluence of fine hotels , play opportunities in everything from sunning and surfing to golf and shuffleboard and badminton-on-the-beach , and a rich variety of living conditions from cottages by the sea to high-rise " Presidential Suites , " The particular gift of Maui is that it offers a regenerative change of pace , even for those who elect not to remain cloistered in the superbly supine life of the resort . " We put 660 miles on our car in a little more thana week , " one housewife told us . The wanderlust on this splendid island is richly rewarding . To the north of Kaanapali are wild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other island in the world . To the southeast are sugarcane fields as vast as an inland sea . On the deep southeast side of the island is a pocket of genuine Hawaiian culture-there are many left-that is called Hana . It was long isolated from the rest of the archipelago by the dense rain forests that surround it , and even today its people still tend to speak in the twelve-letter Hawaiian tongue or in a pidgin English built around it . ( A very few years ago , the first " Western " drama ever presented in Hana , My Three Sons , was done entirely in pidgin . ) Somewhat closer to home-only four miles south of Kaanapali , in fact-is the old whaling port of Lahaina , where the traditions are still rooted in the past but where modern skills are not always up to those traditions . One Sunday morning last spring , the master of the Carthaginian , the ninety-three-foot square-master that you might have seen in the movie Hawaii , took the ship a very few feet out from the dock and suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouth of Lahaina harbor . Nobody knows the reason for the incident-some gossiped that the ship 's rudder was broken-but it became one of the highlights of the year for the decade ) for sightseers in Lahaina . ( " You ca n't kid me , " said a skeptic . " They stage this every week for the tourists . " ) The strenuous , and futile , efforts to salvage the ship-and just to reduce the losses that far exceeded $75,000-aroused a brimming good humor among onlookers . " It 's fitting , " said one . " If God wanted people to sail upon the seas , they would have been born with water wings . " Haleakala , the brooding old long-extinct volcano , is on the east side of the island . At the bottom of this huge crater , large enough to envelop the whole island of Manhattan , goats graze on a meadowland where there blossoms the rare silversword plant , a cluster of brilliantly colored needles that grows only here and on the neighboring island of Hawaii . There is a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-quiescent a volcano , for it suggests the primordial beginnings of the islands when , in the shadowed eons before men were , a great gash opened in the then-barren basic of the Pacific and a cataclysmic series of upheavals heaved these volcanic masses skyward . And later as the seas gathered around them , formed islands . The sense of awe and insight is a profound one : " I felt , " wrote Mark Twain of visiting Haleakala , " like the Last Man , neglected of judgment , and left pinnacled in mid-heaven , a forgotten relic of a vanished world . " It is this mood that dominates a visit to the volcanos of Hawaii , the " big island " that is the southernmost in the archipelago . For here are live volcanos as well as dormant ones and it is in their presence that one discovers the capacity of these islands to enlarge man and deepen him- to give him an experience unmatched by other travel to other places . For one suddenly knows that he does not merely go back to the beginnings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . For in trudging the volcanic lands of Hawaii , one comes to feel that he is being thrust back into the world 's beginnings : lichen , moss , and tree ferns-theplanet 's earliest vegetation-sprout from fields of black-satin lava only newly cooled to the touch . He also comes to feel that he is in continuing touch with creation : the lava from an eruption a very few years ago flowed down to the seacoast , fell hissing and steaming into the sea , and hardened there , developing , out of the molten rock in the earth 's mantle , 500 new acres on the island of Hawaii . Thus were the islands formed and enlarged-and thus the process of creation continues . The most active volcano in the world , Kilauea , is on Hawaii . On quiet days , there are some fifty tiny " quakes " on Kilauea , most of them imperceptible to any but the most sensitive of instruments . On days when eruptions approach , there are 1,500 or 2.000 of them . The reason : some two miles below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts back and forth , like frothing waters in an enclosed pool ; as the magma shifts , under heavy pressure from the gases within it , it causes the underground earth to shift ever so slightly . In fact , scientists who live on and around Kilauea have discovered that the rim of the volcano got swollen and tilted some three feet before one eruption . All this helps provide signals of when Kilauea is about to erupt and that helps provide an environment which is unparalleled anywhere else in the world : one in which it is possible to study erupting volcanos and to do it safely . In fact , the National Park Service , which runs the Hawaii Volcanos National Park , has set up a number of overlooks so that visitors can stand and watch-from a snug , though safe distance- the natural violence of the earth creating itself : it located one such vista within a half-mile of one eruption whose plumes of flaming gas and lava seared 1,900 feet into the sky , the longest and high est sustained volcanic " torch " known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience of Hawaii has in it the potential for expanding the intellectual and sensory experience of man as well as the ease with which he may indulge it . The one quality that an individual must bring to Hawaii , in this time of heightened organization , is an awareness . It is an awareness that there are changes and there are , consequently , problems in paradise : the problems that belabor the world- population , ecology , economics , crime , and the rate of change itself . It is an awareness that the ancient dream is shadowed with a modern reality , that one can not find a twelfth-century retreat in twentieth-century America . It is an awareness of one 's own mood - the dominant desires in one 's own temperament and where to match it in modern-day Hawaii . Most of all , it is an awareness that if one brings one 's own heightened perceptions to Hawaii , he will find-as we did-that the Islands have more to offer him than he has to offer the islands .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
