Ohio pays Kent State victims <P> It took more than eight years and cost at least $1 million in public funds spent on three trials and multiple investigations , but the State of Ohio last week finally did what it should have done on May 4 , 1970 . A statement signed by Governor James Rhodes and 27 Ohio National Guardsmen expressed official " regret " that four students at Kent State University had been needlessly killed and nine others wounded by the Guardsmen on that day . With the statement and agreement by the state to pay the victims or their parents $675,000 , a retrial of the civil suit brought by the families was halted in Cleveland and the suit was dismissed . <P> Sanford J. Rosen , San Francisco lawyer for the victims , termed the out-of-court settlement " a great victory . " On the other side , Sylvester Del Corso , adjutant general of the Guard in 1970 , insisted : " There is no apology . We expressed sorrow and regret just as you would express condolences to the family of someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial had continued , predicted Ohio Attorney General William J. Brown , " we could lose this case . " Said Arthur Krause , whose daughter Allison was killed : " I 'm tired . I ca n't sit in a courtroom and look at those Guardsmen any more . Their leaders ought to be ashamed that they ca n't admit they are apologizing . "
