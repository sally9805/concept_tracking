txt As North and South Vietnam move closer to reunification ? with the North very much in the driver 's seat ? this is the current status of Hanoi 's relations with : ? Washington ? softer than at any time since the collapse in Saigon nearly seven months ago . ? Moscow ? closer than at the time of the collapse in Saigon . North Vietnamese party leader Le Duan , on his recent visit to the U.S.S.R. , subscribed in an agreed statement for the first time to a key Soviet anti-Chinese catch phrase , " the inevitability of detente . " ? Peking ? cooler than at any time since the collapse in Saigon . Le Duan 's acceptance of " the inevitability of detente " in Moscow came on the heels of a visit to Peking which he apparently cut short because things had not gone well in his talks with Chinese leaders . Signs of the softening in relations between Washington and Hanoi include : 1 . Hanoi 's acceptance of a shipload of South Vietnamese refugees who voluntarily decided to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guam ; 2. release by the Vietnamese of nine Americans , mostly missionaries , held since last March ; 3 . U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger 's reported statement behind closed doors just over a week ago to a congressional committee that he saw " no obstacle to the principle of normalization of relations with the Vietnamese " ; and 4 . Washington 's lifting of its ban on the shipment to Vietnam by the Society of Friends ( Quakers ) of relief and rehabilitation supplies . // *Hanoi , U.S. thaw once icy relations // Despite the emotions on both sides at the time of the Communist victory in Saigon , Washington and Hanoi have apparently been in tacit agreement since then on avoiding action which might lead to a long deep-freeze on U.S.-Vietnamese relations such as occurred in Washington-Peking relations after the Communist victory in China . So far they have succeeded ? although normalization of relations is still hardly round the corner . In both the U.S. and Vietnam , domestic politics might well dictate the speed of such normalization . In the U.S. , presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1976 . In Vietnam , the Communist Party leadership finds itself deeply involved in implementing the reunification of North and South Vietnam , some months in the cards but not formally and publicly decided until a meeting in Saigon last week of representatives of both parts of the divided country . The only specific detail of the timetable for reunification published after the Saigon meeting was that elections would be held in the North and South in the first half of next year for a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution for a reunited Vietnam . ( Some forecast these elections will be in March ; others suggest April 30 , anniversary of the fall of Saigon . ) No public announcement was made about such emotionally important details as where the capital would be , what the flag would be , or what the natonal anthem would be . But everybody expects the capital to be Hanoi ( not Saigon ) , and indirect confirmation of this has come in a subsequent report that Hanoi is about to be spruced up as befits its role . Perhaps news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliquely . In deciding in late summer on early reunification ? contrary to earlier intentions ? the North Vietnamese may well have bitten off almost more than they can chew . The North 's chief delegate at the Saigon meeting , Truong Chinh , indirectly recognized this by pointing to the differences as well as the similarities between the North and South in economic and social structure . The biggest difference , of course , is that North Vietnam is by and large a communist society after nearly a quarter of a century of communist rule . In the South , as Truong Chinh conceded , this is still far from being so ? with the influences of " American neocolonialism " and " feudal ideology " ( to use his words ) very much in evidence . While this has been going on , incidents involving the two other component parts of former Indochina ? Cambodia and Laos ? are reminders of the conflicting forces within an area which the Vietnamese Communists have long tended to see as their sphere of influence by right .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
