The men who own and control major league baseball , Frank Robinson said earlier this season , " can afford whatever they want . " Robby was talking about lavish six-figure salaries ( his own is estimated at about $200,000 ) . He was too polite to add that for all their cash , none of the owners of the 24 major league teams felt that they could afford to have a black man calling the shots from the dugout . Until last week , that is . Then , with a ceremonial roll of the public relations drums , the Cleveland Indians announced that Robinson had stepped across baseball 's ultimate color line and become the team 's new manager . <P> For Robinson , 39 , the appointment was the culmination of a carefully orchestrated campaign that officially began six years ago when he became a manager in the Puerto Rican winter league . " All I want , " he said , " is the chance to manage . " He still spent his summers slugging home runs as an All-Star outfielder for the Orioles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pennants in Puerto Rico proved that he deserved the big opportunity he sought . <P> Coming 27 years after Branch Rickey put a Dodger uniform on another Robinson and summarily broke the color line on the playing field , the appointment ends what had become a national disgrace . Team owners had simply lacked the guts to select any of the blacks who have enriched the game in recent years . Today , 150 of the sport 's 600 major leaguers are black . Earlier this season , even Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn felt constrained to issue a public call for the selection of a black . <P> With his new one-year contract , Robinson will be guiding a team of limited talent in a town traditionally known as the " graveyard of managers . " His job will not be made any easier by a barely concealed black-white schism on this year 's team . But Star Pitcher Gaylord Perry , who had earlier threatened to leave the club if Robinson took over , joined with other players to say that they would give their new skipper a chance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one player of considerable skills on his side : himself . The only man ever to win the Most Valuable Player award in both leagues , Robby will double next season as the team 's designated hitter . He thus becomes the game 's first playing manager since Hank Bauer at Kansas City in 1961 . Cleveland 's last double-duty manager , Lou Boudreau , led the Tribe to a World Series victory in 1948 . <P> It is doubtful if Robinson can match that feat with his present players . But given his reputation , he may manage some surprises . Win or lose , he intends to remain a stubborn , combative athlete ; he feels no urge to play the role of ball-park civil libertarian . " The only reason I 'm the first black manager , " he says , " is because I was born black . "
