YAHOODI Here I come ! ( traveling through different terrain ) Here I is . KOSMO I 've had a vision . YAHOODI Yeah ? KOSMO It came to me in music . It was like old rhythm-and-blues and gospel , a cappella , sort of like The Persuasions but with this bitchin ' lead line . Like a Hendrix lead line . Like a living Hendrix lead line right through the middle of it . YAHOODI What about the visuals ? Did ya see any pictures ? KOSMO A tall golden woman like Marlene Dietrich or something . In short shorts and teased blonde hair . Carrying a whip . SHE appears and cracks her whip . YAHOODI Sing it . KOSMO I ca n't . I ca n't get my head straight . I have to take a trip . I have to go somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's gettin ' me down . Too many tangents . It 's no place to collaborate . YAHOODI Maybe we could do it by mail . I 'll go to the jungle and write you . KOSMO Good idea . I 'll go to San Francisco and do the same . YAHOODI Good luck , brother . KOSMO Same here . THEY travel in different directions . YAHOODI winds up in the jungle and KOSMO in Frisco . MARLENE comes down to the audience . SHE sings " Jungen Mensch . " MARLENE DIETRICH Silly boys just young menGo away and then they come againThey do n't yet know who they areSilly boys just young men following a star They hurry here and they hurry thereEager with their empty handsTheir heads are full their hearts are tooOh hurry how hurried my lovely fools End and then begin and end againLike reflections in a poolAnd loneliness comes like a dartThere 's nothing to find till you find your heart KOSMO ( calling across a great expanse ) Yahoodi ! p. 5 YAHOODI ( calling back ) Yeah ! KOSMO I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's Mae West singing the blues like Janis Joplin ! YAHOODI No shit ! Should I come back ? KOSMO Not yet . I have n't been able to give it any form . She 's just sort of strutting around . There 's so much cigarette smoke you can barely see her . YAHOODI What 's it like there ? KOSMO Full of inspiration ! Jack Kerouac country ! The Grateful Dead . The Airplane , Quicksilver . The air is full of grist for the mill . The Pacific is blue as hell . How ' bout you ? YAHOODI Steaming jungle ! Coconut girls ! Giant pythons ! Swinging in my hammock all day long . KOSMO Are you off the needle ? YAHOODI Do n't put me down . KOSMO I ca n't help it . I get concerned . YAHOODI How about you ! How 's your depressions ?

I keep feeling like I 'm getting closer and closer to the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YAHOODI That 's good . It 's nighttime here and all the stars are out . The jungle makes the weirdest sounds . Jaguars are running wild . The little kids are sucking on mangoes . Suck , suck , suck , all night long . KOSMO ( to MAE WEST ) Could you take me for a trolley ride ? MAE WEST I 'll take ya for everything ya got . KOSMO Outa sight . THEY go for a trolley ride . YAHOODI Ever since I was a little boy I used to watch the subway come up out of the ground and wonder about all those people . How all those people were just living their lives and could n't care less about me . About how separate we were . Them on the train and me watching them . Them in their life and me in mine . I could see them and hear them and smell them but they did n't even know I existed . Good for them I 'd say . Good for me . Hurray for life . KOSMO ( to MAE , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image I have in my head of you . You seemed so big in the movies . MAE WEST Big surprises come in small packages . KOSMO I could really fall for someone like you . p. 7 MAE WEST You 're not exactly a dog yourself . KOSMO I had this vision of you , and you were singing like Janis Joplin . MAE WEST Never heard of her . KOSMO She 's dead . MAE WEST Maybe that 's why . KOSMO She was a lot like you . Lots of balls . She could really belt it out . MAE WEST Yeah , well , beltin 's not exactly my specialty . KOSMO She was lying face down between two double beds with her right hand holding the phone so hard that the veins were standing out on her thumb . She had a squirrel fur wrapped around her neck with little black eyes that stared out at me . There were ostrich feathers lying around on the rug and blowing into the air conditioning . The air conditioner made this high , whining sort of sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice talking to me , even though she was dead . Then it started to sing . Not like she sang when she was alive , but another kind of voice . A crystal voice . It passed right through me and then the window broke behind me . Like her voice went right through the window . I ran outside into the parking lot of the hotel . I could see her voice sailing over the parked cars . Sailing out over Sunset Boulevard . I ran after the voice . I tried to catch up , but each time I got nearer it took off again , like trying to catch a runaway kite . It sailed higher and higher , and then I saw you . p. 8 MAE WEST Me ? What was I doing there ? KOSMO You were dancing to the voice . You were all dressed in red and you swayed back and forth . You swallowed the voice with the most delicious gulp and then you started to sing . You sang " When a man loves a woman . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to a dead stop and everyone was listening . Just listening . It was the most beautiful dream I 've ever had . MAE WEST What do ya say we get us a bottle of hooch and find us a nice cozy place ? KOSMO Okay by me . THEY get a bottle and find a nice cozy place . YAHOODI ( calling across a great expanse , but KOSMO does n't hear ) Kosmo ! It 's starting to hit me ! Like a sledgehammer ! Right in the chest ! I need to get off ! Kosmo ! I need some Doliphine at least ! Just a little something to tide me over ! This jungle 's tearing me apart ! The bugs are driving me bats ! MARLENE enters and goes to YAHOODI . MARLENE DIETRICH You put too much emphasis on the pain . Take your mind off the pain . Take your mind off the pain . Your friend is safe and sound in San Francisco . YAHOODI Fuck him ! Fuck my friend ! What good 's he do me now ? ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any money ? If only I was better known ! If only I was famous ! I could fly back to the city and put a needle in my arm ! I could buy a farm in the country and raise a family and be a happily married man . p. 9 MARLENE DIETRICH It 's a good thing to dream . YAHOODI What do you know ? What do you know about my suffering ? What 's your suffering compared to mine ? MARLENE DIETRICH I could take it away . I could steal it from you . YAHOODI I do n't need sex ! I need some dope ! Dope ! I need some dope ! MARLENE DIETRICH I need , you need , we all need some ice cream . THEY go into a heavy clinch and slurp each other up . Then THEY fall asleep .

You were gettin ' a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where are you taking me ? I want to go home . MAE WEST Just a little cruise down to Big Sur .

If I miss my moment in history it may never happen again . I 've got to become involved . p. 10 MAE WEST You were doin ' all right by me . KOSMO I 've got ta make bombs and speeches and mobilize the people . I 've got ta work for the party . I 've got ta see to it that justice is done . It 's now or never . Now is real !

I do believe I 've had enough . What highway is this ? PAUL BUNYAN This is the North Woods . Ai n't no highway for miles . Just lumber camps and diners and trucks and chain saws . Sell ya a good ax if ya need one . That 's all I use . These new fellas they use the chain saws , but not me . I can outchop the fastest chain saw around . KOSMO I believe it . Just point me in the direction of home , okay ? PAUL BUNYAN I need to find my ox or I 'm up shit creek without a paddle . There 's nothin ' like a good ox . Worth their weight in gold . Especially old Babe . p. 11 KOSMO My mind 's going a mile a minute ! I 've got to slow down . PAUL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the North Woods for a little peace and quite . Just chew on some acorns . Hum a little tune . Whittle your fingernails . KOSMO But I 'm a musician ! I 've got to create ! I 've got to get back to the city . Back to my band . Back to my roots . I 've lost touch with my roots . PAUL BUNYAN You city folks are all alike . Always tryin ' to make a buck . KOSMO No . I 'm not in it for the money . I 'm an artist . PAUL BUNYAN Me , I 'm a lumberjack . See ya around . HE exits . YAHOODI wakes up . MARLENE stays asleep . YAHOODI ( calling across a great expanse ) Kosmo ! I had a dream ! I dreamed I was Crazy Horse ! I was leading a raiding party against the Crows . I wore a small yellow stone under my left ear , and a hawk circled over me as I rode into battle . I felt what it was like to have no fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . The arrows flew all around me but none of them touched me . It was like I had an understanding of space in another dimension . I knew where the arrows would land . I knew  --  ( HE notices MARLENE ) Hey ! Hey , Marlene ! Hey . Wake up . Stupid broad . What are ya gon na do , sleep the day away ? Hey , Kosmo , I think she 's o.d. ' d or something . Kosmo ! p. 12 KOSMO I was on a Greyhound bus out of Carlsbad heading for Loving , New Mexico . Back to see my dad . After ten years . All duded out in a double-breasted suit with my shoes all shined . The driver calls out " Loving " and I get off the bus . The bus takes off and leaves me in a cloud of dust . Nothing but dust . The dust clears and there I am . Standing right in the middle of a ghost town . Nothing . The stores all boarded up . The windows all busted out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the street . There 's the old Bijou Theatre with Anita Ekberg 's name still on it from 1959 . And Rose 's Cafe where I used to have enchiladas and tamales . And there , way down at the end of the road , rising up like a beautiful vision is my old man 's bar . The Palace Saloon ! I walk in and all this music comes blasting out at me . It 's Pedro Enfantes on the juke box . And my old man behind the bar . His shoulder holster bulging out underneath his coat . I order a beer . And he says sure , son , have a beer . And I say do n't call me son . And he says why not and I say because I am you son . And he says sure . And I say I am ! And he says fuck off . So I say fuck off . Do n't you recognize me ? It 's me , your son ! YAHOODI ( calling across a great expanse ) Kosmo ! KOSMO Yeah ! YAHOODI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come ! ( HE travels through different terrain and arrives at YAHOODI ) YAHOODI I had a vision you were coming . KOSMO Here I am . YAHOODI How was your trip ? KOSMO I lost my way . It 's no fun being on the road . YAHOODI I know what ya mean . Still , it 's good to get away for a while . This city 's a real drag . All I ever do is shoot doogie . KOSMO What about your vision ? YAHOODI A giant American bald eagle flying through a smoke-filled sky with the world clutched in his talons . He flies higher and higher until he ca n't fly anymore and then he lets the world drop . The world falls faster and faster through the smoke-filled sky and plunges into the ocean and explodes sending a huge tidal wave up to the surface . KOSMO I 'm getting fucking tired of apocalypses . All I ever hear anymore is apocalypse , apocalypse . What about something with some hope ? YAHOODI It 's up to you , boy . WACO enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat , with a beat-up guitar .

That 's what a man 's supposed to do . The only thing a man can do . Just follow your heart . KOSMO Maybe you 're right . WACO Sure . KOSMO But look where it got you . You 're from Texas ?

Maybe working in the oil fields . Or gold ! How about gold ! Did you ever think of that ? MARLENE DIETRICH No . You did . YAHOODI Yeah . Sure . Gold ! Why not .

MARLENE DIETRICH Your eyes . Such mysterious eyes . THEY go into a long clinch . p. 19 YAHOODI ( on the phone ) Kosmo ! That you ? KOSMO ( on the phone ) Yahoodi ? Where you been ? YAHOODI Listen , I 've run into a hot deal down here in the jungle and I need some fast money . Say a couple G 's . KOSMO A couple G 's ? I 'll check out my royalties . I think I can swing it . What is it , dope ? YAHOODI No , gold ! Lots and lots of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away ! YAHOODI Thanks , pal . ( HE hangs up ) KOSMO ( to WACO ) That was Yahoodi . He 's struck gold . WACO Gold ? In the Yukon ? KOSMO Nope . Somewhere in the jungle . WACO Hot diggity . KOSMO We got ta get down there , Waco . WACO Not me , boy . I 'm allergic to mosquitoes . KOSMO Come on , it 's now or never . THEY travel south . YAHOODI goes to MARLENE and PAUL BUNYAN . p. 20 YAHOODI Listen , I just contacted my man . He 's sending us a couple of G 's . So we 're all set . All we need now is the mules . CAPTAIN KIDD enters . CAPTAIN KIDD What do ya wan na play around with mules for , limey ?

This is Marlene Dietrich and Paul Bunyan . My name 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's this about a treasure ? CAPTAIN KIDD Spanish bullion tucked away in a neat little island protected by the prettiest cove ye ever laid eyes on . YAHOODI Must be gone by now . Somebody musta run across it . CAPTAIN KIDD No sir . It 's protected by a ghost . An Indian girl who hides deep in the cave where it 's buried . MARLENE DIETRICH Sounds pretty risky , darling . PAUL BUNYAN Yeah , you can count me out . All I want is my Babe . I 'll see you around . ( HE exits ) YAHOODI Wait a minute ! That always happens . Just as things are beginning to look up everybody cops out . p. 21 MARLENE DIETRICH Listen , darling , it does sound a little farfetched . It could be , how do you say , a " wild goose chase . " YAHOODI You too ? Everybody 's turning against me . Go then ! Go ! MARLENE DIETRICH Now do n't be so hasty , darling . YAHOODI Ya got a map of this island , Kidd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right ? CAPTAIN KIDD Right . Here is the map . HE pulls out a huge map . YAHOODI , MARLENE and CAPTAIN KIDD examine it . We go to WACO and KOSMO . As THEY travel along , THEY sing " Travelin ' Shoes . " WACO AND KOSMO I 'm just travelin ' along in my shoesPayin ' my dues , travelin ' along When I get that hold down bluesI get on the move with my travelin ' shoes La da la da la da da la da la da la THEY sing this through twice . WACO Say listen , ai n't we gone quite a fer piece ? This is gettin ' a little tiring . KOSMO Let 's just sit down here by the side of the stream and take a little breather . THEY sit and drink from the stream . MAE WEST sneaks up behind WACO . HE sees her reflection in the water . p. 22 WACO Sure is a long trip . I never woulda come if I 'd a knowed it was gon na take so long . KOSMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that gold ! Just think of it ! We 'll be able to go anywhere and do anything and be anyone we want to .

You could be Gene Autry or somebody like that . That 's great ! You be Gene Autry and I 'll be Jimmie Rodgers and we 'll form a singing team . How ' bout it ? KOSMO No thanks . I got my own music to sing . WACO Boy , your feet sure do smell . Do n't you ever take yer boots off ? KOSMO My feet ? I was gon na say the same about your feet . WACO Well , I know my feet smell but that ai n't no excuse for lettin ' yer feet go to pot . You got ta take care a yer feet , boy . That 's what gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about besides my feet . WACO Maybe that 's yer whole problem . If ya worried more about yer feet smellin ' so bad and less about things that do n't exist you 'd be a happier fella . Take me as a case in point . I 've spent my whole life worrying about things that might happen that never did happen . p. 23 KOSMO Sure is nice country out here . Too bad we have to move on . WACO Yeah , well that 's the thing about travelin ' . Ya never get to see the things in between where yer comin ' from and where yer going to . Say , you been noticin ' any change in my appearance lately ? KOSMO No . Why ? WACO Well , my reflection sure does remind me of this beautiful broad I used to know back in Omaha . MAE WEST Coulda been Pensacola for all the attention ya gave me . HE turns around and grabs MAE by the waist and dances around with her . WACO Mae ! Well , I 'll be a snaggle-toothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEST Easy on the merchandise , big boy . HE puts her down . WACO Last time I seen you , you was holdin ' four kings to my four queens . MAE WEST You never was much with the ladies . KOSMO What made you show up at such an opportune moment ? MAE WEST I can smell a gold mine a mile off . Same as a man , only sweeter . KOSMO I suppose you figure we 're going to cut you in on this deal . p. 24 MAE WEST Listen , I know how to wrap that Yahoodi character around my little finger . I 'll have him eatin ' outa the palm a my hand . All you fellas have to do is step in and take things over . WACO Sounds good to me . KOSMO I do n't know . He 's a friend of mine . MAE WEST Listen , big boy , what do ya think he 's doin ' down there in that Mexican jungle with Marlene ? Sellin ' lottery tickets ? He 's gon na rip you off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and head West . KOSMO Yahoodi ? He would n't do that . MAE WEST I 've seen suckers , but you take the bananas . WACO What 're you gettin ' at , Mae ? MAE WEST We play it cool . We go down in disguises and infiltrate into the village where they 're camped out . One of us finds out the lowdown . Then we give them the money . KOSMO But he does n't even know I 'm coming . MAE WEST That 's why the disguise . Soon as we find out what the plan is we step in and take the whole thing over . WACO Just like that ? MAE WEST Just like that . KOSMO Would n't it be better to follow them to the mines to make sure we can find them ? p. 25 MAE WEST We 'll play it by ear . KOSMO Let 's go . THEY travel south , singing a snatch of " Travelin ' Shoes . " Mean-while , back to MARLENE and the BOYS . YAHOODI This is a hard map to follow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad . It 's clear sailin ' all the way . YAHOODI We still got ta wait for the money . Kosmo promised he 'd send it . I 've been thinkin ' we ought a divvy up the loot with him , too . CAPTAIN KIDD What 's this ! Another party ! I had n't bargained for another party , laddie . YAHOODI Now wait a minute . He 's my friend . I ca n't just cut him out of the deal . MARLENE DIETRICH But darling , he 's so rich . He 's a famous pop star . YAHOODI That do n't cut no ice . A friend is a friend . We took the oath . We drank each other 's blood . MARLENE DIETRICH That 's disgusting . YAHOODI Besides , what do we need his money for , anyway ? We 've got a boat . CAPTAIN KIDD We have to travel . We have to eat . YAHOODI I 'm beginning to have my doubts about this whole thing . How come you need us to go and get your treasure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know where it is . Why are you so all fired up to cut us in on the deal ? p. 26 CAPTAIN KIDD You have no idea how much there is . Chest after chest piled so high you can barely see the top . A treasure so vast it would take one man a lifetime to bring it up to the surface . Besides , I 'm getting old . I 'm not long for this earth , and it would do my heart joy to see two young people such as yerselves partake of such riches . YAHOODI I do n't know . I do n't like doin ' my friend dirty like that . I mean just taking his money and running away . MARLENE DIETRICH But think of our life together , Yahoodi . We could go to San Francisco , Paris , Rome , Berlin . Ah , Berlin ! YAHOODI What do I wan na go to Berlin for ? I 'm an American . CAPTAIN KIDD Then forget the whole thing . I 'll go find some peasants . ( HE rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait . I 'll do it . I 'll do it . MARLENE DIETRICH That 's more like it , darling . CAPTAIN KIDD Now the first thing we got ta do is wait for the money . YAHOODI Right . MARLENE DIETRICH I 'll handle your friend when he comes . Just leave him to me . Back to MAE WEST and the BOYS . THEY have on ridiculous disguises  --  beards and masks and stuff . False noses would be good . p. 27 MAE WEST Now listen , Kosmo , what you got ta do is pretend you 're a peasant that 's working for Western Union . You got a special cablegram to deliver this money to Mr. Yahoodi . You got that ? KOSMO Got it . WACO What do we do ? MAE WEST Just sit tight . We 'll think a something . Okay , now go to it . KOSMO sneaks over to MARLENE and the BOYS in his special disguise , with a black satchel full of money . KOSMO Cablegram for Meester Yahoodi ! YAHOODI That 's me . KOSMO Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special delivery from Meester Kosmo . YAHOODI Good . Hand it over . HE hands over the satchel . YAHOODI looks inside.Thank you very much . MARLENE DIETRICH Darling , tip the boy . YAHOODI Oh , yeah . ( HE pulls out a bill and hands it to KOSMO ) This is for you . KOSMO Thank you , seor . YAHOODI Oh , and send a cable back to Mr. Kosmo telling him thank you very much we got your money . p. 28 KOSMO I do n't got a pencil . YAHOODI Okay , forget it . KOSMO Okay , gracias , seor . YAHOODI Yeah . Gracias . CAPTAIN KIDD Adios . KOSMOS goes back to MAE and WACO . YAHOODI and the OTHERS break into cheers . YAHOODI We got it ! We got it ! We 're gon na be rich ! KOSMO ( to MAE ) I think the dirty rat was plannin ' on cutting me out of the deal all along . MAE WEST It 's all right . We got him where we want him . It 's only a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a fire and have some hot fritters . MAE WEST No . We let them build the fires . We let them make the moves . We just follow along in their footsteps . We 're gon na shadow them right to that treasure , boys . MARLENE and the BOYS build a fire and sit around eating and talking . YAHOODI What about this boat , Captain ? Do n't we need a crew or something ? CAPTAIN KIDD Naw . As worthy a vessel you 've never seen . The three of us can handle her easy . p. 29 MARLENE DIETRICH Darling , where exactly is the treasure located ? CAPTAIN KIDD A little island near the Aleutian group . It should n't be hard to recognize . I 'll remember it once we get there . YAHOODI What 's the treasure like , Captain Kidd ? I mean what is it , jewels and stuff ? CAPTAIN KIDD Aaah , laddie . ' T is a treasure to make a man 's eyes dance out of his head . There 's a ruby ring as big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maiden who boldly resisted . I was forced to sever her finger from her hand with my saber while her lover stood helplessly by . Those were the days before my conversion , before I saw the light . The cruel days . YAHOODI What made you become a pirate in the first place ? CAPTAIN KIDD Everyone was doing it . I was sent by the king to put a stop to all this swashbuckling nonsense . But after several days at sea I realized I was working for the wrong side . No one was a bigger pirate than the king himself . So I decided to beat him at his own game . I would become as ruthless , as fearsome and as cruel as all the fancy-dressed snuff-sniffers riding their gilded carriages to and from the palace . MARLENE DIETRICH What other treasures are there , darling ? p. 30 CAPTAIN KIDD Sapphires , topaz , diamonds , and pearls . A gold watch with emerald hands on inlaid ivory and ebony , snatched from a poor lad as he was walking the plank . Pouches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platters and vases . Crystal chandeliers .

THEY fall asleep . Both camps are sleeping . The night sounds of crickets and small jungle creatures . YAHOODI and KOSMO talk to each other in their sleep . The OTHERS stay asleep . YAHOODI tosses about as though having a nightmare . YAHOODI Kosmo ! It is n't really me . Not my voice . It 's you . No . That does n't make sense . We 'll meet up sooner or later . You 've taken my place . That 's an awful thing to lay on someone . I 'm so many different people at once . I keep running away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? My feet are caught in the quicksand .

MAE WEST You think they 're up to something , huh ? All right , but be quick about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KOSMO I 'll be right back . KOSMO sneaks off through the jungle to where MARLENE and the BOYS were camped . WACO Listen , Mae , to tell you the truth I 'm scared shitless . I mean I ai n't used to the jungle . The open prairie 's my stompin ' grounds . MAE WEST Yeah , well just cool yourself out . The worst is yet to come . I wonder what 's keeping Kosmo . WACO The tigres probably got him . I knew it ! I knew it ! We 're all gon na die ! KOSMO discovers that MARLENE and the BOYS have split . HE goes running back to MAE and WACO with the news . MAE WEST Just take it easy . SHHH !

Back to MARLENE and the BOYS riding the high seas in their boat . CAPTAIN KIDD sings " Fadin ' . " CAPTAIN KIDD I once was the master of the torrid high seasI pillaged the king 's ships , I stole what I pleasedMy heart was full sail tattooed with sinYou could rest my good deeds on the head of a pin I raged and men feared me , they called me black heartGold tooth and black patch and tongue like a dartThe women all wanted me and called me a louseThough tempted by treasure and my black pirate mouth With visions of white ships I crawled through the nightA victim of penitence and clean-living lightI traded my dark deeds for an angel 's good wordMy soul fled the devil like a trembling bird My masthead throws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Captain Kidd fadesOn the torrid high seas where Captain Kidd fades I deceive all that 's evil , offer gifts from the seaThe navigator saints all smile on meAnd the Book I once branded a book black as hellFloats broken and damaged in the earth 's briny cell Yet I once was the master of the torrid high seasA skull and crossbones draped around meI wear my past proudly tight like a gloveMy terrible deeds twist me like love My masthead throws a shadow black as a spadeOn the torrid high seas where Captain Kidd fadesOn the torrid high seas where Captain Kidd fades p. 36 YAHOODI This is the life . What a life . How ' bout it , Marlene ? Ai n't this the life ! MARLENE DIETRICH ( hanging over the side of the boat ) I think I 'm going to be sick . YAHOODI What a life . Say , Captain , I would n't mind taking that treasure and sailing around the world . Just taking a nice long cruise . What do ya say ? CAPTAIN KIDD No , laddie , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spain . Me and the high seas have seen too much of each other . YAHOODI Sharks ! Look ! There 's sharks ! CAPTAIN KIDD No , me lad . Them 's dolphins . Hard to tell the difference at first . But they 're a friend of man . If ya listen real close they sing a certain song . Us old sea dogs can hear it a mile off . YAHOODI I think I hear it . CAPTAIN KIDD No , you ca n't hear it . Only us old sea dogs can hear it . YAHOODI But I hear it . I swear I can hear it . CAPTAIN KIDD Well , I ca n't hear it , so how could you be hearin ' it ? MARLENE keeps puking over the side . YAHOODI Then it is my imagination . Like last night . I was hearing something last night too . I am hearing something . We are being followed . Faster , Captain Kidd ! Faster ! p. 37 CAPTAIN KIDD Just settle down , me lad . There 's nothin ' around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' but the deep blue sea . YAHOODI Gim me your telescope . I 'm going to take a look . CAPTAIN KIDD hands him a telescope . YAHOODI looks behind him . CAPTAIN KIDD Well , what do ya see ? YAHOODI I see a bunch of Mexicans waving a flag and dancing around a fire . CAPTAIN KIDD What else do ya see ? YAHOODI I see two men on a raft eating Tootsie Rolls . CAPTAIN KIDD What else do ya see ? YAHOODI I see the whole world going up in smoke and everybody 's asleep . There 's one old man with a long gray beard trying to wake everybody up but nobody can hear him . They just keep sleeping and sleeping . CAPTAIN KIDD Give me back the telescope . You 've gone mad , me lad . It happens to the best of us . But this old ocean does funny things to the mind of man . YAHOODI You really think I 'm crazy ? CAPTAIN KIDD No crazier than the likes of me . YAHOODI I wish she 'd stop throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the BOYS caught in a storm on the high seas . THEY 're in a rowboat. p. 38 WACO I knew it ! We 're gon na die ! We 're all gon na die ! KOSMO Will you shut up . It 's just a storm . It 'll pass . MAE WEST Watch the port bow , boys . There 's a real crusher wave coming up . WACO I think I 'm gon na be sick . WACO throws up over the side . MAE WEST I 've seen useless men in my day , but he takes the cake . KOSMO He 's all right , Mae . He 's just used to dry land . He 's a cowboy . Cowboys do n't go to sea . MAE WEST Cowboy , my eyeball . He 's a useless twerp . We shoulda canned him right from the start . KOSMO Now do n't start that . Just because we 're in a crisis does n't mean we ca n't get along . MAE WEST Man the starboard keel ! Bring her about ! Bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? MAE WEST I 've been around , sonny . KOSMO Looks like it 's gon na clear up . MAE WEST Just like that ? KOSMO Looks like it . Looks like it 's going to be a beautiful day . p. 39 MAE WEST All right , you can stop being sick , mister . The storm 's over . KOSMO Yeah , it looks like it 's going to be clear as a bell . MAE WEST Here , take a look through this thing and see if you can spot their boat . SHE hands him a telescope . KOSMO looks through it . MAE WEST You see anything ? KOSMO Wild dogs . MAE WEST What do you mean ? KOSMO Wild dogs . Circling around . Tracking something down . MAE WEST You must be going crazy . Gim me that thing . HE hands it to her . SHE looks through it . MAE WEST It 's them . I can see them . KOSMO Really ? WACO pukes over the side . MAE WEST Looks like they 're having trouble . Marlene 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like one of their sails is broken . There 's sharks circling all around the boat . They 're in real trouble . Looks like we 're gon na catch up to ' em after all . KOSMO Lemme see . ( HE takes the telescope and looks ) p. 40 MAE WEST Can you see them ? KOSMO Nope . I keep hearing music . Jimi Hendrix . MAE WEST You ca n't see them ? You must have cotton in your eyeballs . KOSMO Oh , yeah . Now I see them . Paul Bunyan 's pulling them ashore with his ox . MAE WEST Are you kidding ? KOSMO No . Look . SHE takes the telescope and looks . MAE WEST I ca n't see them anymore . Where 'd they go ? Full steam ahead . Come on ! Let 's get a move on ! Row ! Row ! Row ! Faster ! Faster ! We 're losing them ! THEY all start rowing like crazy . Back to CAPTAIN KIDD . YAHOODI Hey , Captain , how many months have we been out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It makes me sick to think of it . What a waste of a good life . I could be in Berlin having a good time . Or Copenhagen . Anywhere but here in this awful ocean . CAPTAIN KIDD I 'd say maybe six or seven months as the crow flies . YAHOODI That long , huh ? MARLENE DIETRICH It 's awful . My makeup has faded . My furs are all wilted . My stockings are torn . And I 'm starving to death . p. 41 YAHOODI Shut up , will you ? All you ever do is bitch , bitch , bitch . Just be thankful we 're still alive . CAPTAIN KIDD spots land . CAPTAIN KIDD Land ho ! Land ho ! YAHOODI Really ! Land ! It is ! It 's land , Marlene ! We 're safe ! Look ! MARLENE DIETRICH Oh , thank God . Land . At last . YAHOODI Well , what are we waiting for ? Let 's go ashore . CAPTAIN KIDD Not so fast . The natives could be dangerous . YAHOODI Fuck the natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boat and go ashore . CAPTAIN KIDD gets out his map . CAPTAIN KIDD Now if me memory serves me right it should be right in this vicinity . YAHOODI Let 's go , let 's go . Stop fucking around with the map . MARLENE DIETRICH Do n't be so impatient , darling . YAHOODI I wan na get the treasure . Let 's go . THEY march off into the boondocks . Back to MAE in the boat , looking through the telescope . MAE WEST I think I see them . They 've landed or something . p. 42 KOSMO Landed ! They 've found land ! WACO Water ! I need some water . KOSMO Lemme take a look . SHE hands him the telescope . KOSMO They have ! They 've landed . They 're heading right for the treasure . WACO Water , water . KOSMO I keep hearing music . Like distant drums . MAE WEST It must be the natives . KOSMO No , like Janis Joplin . Like Big Brother . MAE WEST You 're just getting paranoid . KOSMO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MAE WEST Gim me the telescope . SHE grabs it away from him and looks through it . WACO Water , water . MAE WEST Looks like the natives have spotted them . They 're circling around them . They 're killing off the natives . KOSMO Well , let 's get ashore . What are we waiting for ? MAE WEST We ca n't let them see the boat . We 'll have to swim . KOSMO Swim ashore ? p. 43 MAE WEST That 's right . You think you 're up to it ? KOSMO I am . I do n't know about him , though . WACO Water , water . MAE WEST We 'll just dump him overboard . He 'll have to sink or swim . KOSMO All right . Let 's go . THEY dump WACO over the side and THEY all start swimming ashore . WACO I ca n't swim ! I 'm going to drown ! MAE WEST Grab ahold of him . Get him by the neck . Swim , you fool ! Swim ! WACO I ca n't ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It looks like sharks ! Heading this way ! It is ! It 's sharks ! MAE WEST Swim ! Swim for your lives ! Back to CAPTAIN KIDD . HE unfolds his map . The OTHERS sit down exhausted . CAPTAIN KIDD I think this is the spot . Right about in here . YAHOODI That 's what you said before . MARLENE DIETRICH These mosquitoes are eating me alive . CAPTAIN KIDD Come on . The cave should be right behind these bushes . p. 44 MARLENE DIETRICH Oh , ca n't we just rest for a while , darling ? I ca n't take another step . YAHOODI Come on . We 're being followed , I tell ya . We ca n't waste any more time . CAPTAIN KIDD Here it is . The cave . I 've found it . I knew it was here . YAHOODI We found it ! We found it ! MARLENE DIETRICH Thank God ! An Indian GHOST GIRL appears with a spear . GHOST GIRL That 's far enough . CAPTAIN KIDD It 's the Indian ghost girl I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ancient tongue ) Santo lala gronto . Muchamo no le santiamo . GHOST GIRL Buzz off , buster . This is Captain Kidd 's treasure . He told me to watch it for him while he was gone . CAPTAIN KIDD But I am Captain Kidd . Do n't you recognize me ? GHOST GIRL He warned me of impostors . And you 're about as phony as they come . CAPTAIN KIDD Wait a minute . I 'm real . I 'm the real Captain Kidd . YAHOODI He is . He 's the real one . GHOST GIRL Oh yeah ? And I suppose she 's supposed to be Marlene Dietrich or something ? p. 45 MARLENE DIETRICH I do n't have to stand here and be insulted . GHOST GIRL That 's right , sister . If you do n't like it you know what you can do about it . MARLENE DIETRICH Are you challenging me , darling ? GHOST GIRL Choose your weapons . MARLENE DIETRICH Fingernails and teeth .

MARLENE and the GHOST GIRL tear into each other and fight all over the stage . YAHOODI Hold her off , Marlene ! We 'll be right back with the treasure . CAPTAIN KIDD and YAHOODI go offstage for the treasure while MARLENE and GHOST GIRL fight . MAE and the BOYS make it up onto the shore . WACO is waterlogged . KOSMO gives him artificial respiration as MAE watches the fight . MAE WEST Musta been a real hunk a man to get them two so all fired up . Probably one a the natives . p. 46 KOSMO Mae , I do n't think he 's gon na make it . MAE WEST Okay , we 'll leave him for the buzzards . He 's been a real drag right from the start . KOSMO We ca n't just leave him here . MAE WEST We 'll come back and pick him up later . After we get that treasure . KOSMO I do n't know . He 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to be gettin ' sentimental . Let 's get a move on . KOSMO Okay . So long , Waco , old buddy . Hope you find Jimmie Rodgers in heaven . MAE WEST He ai n't dead yet . KOSMO All right . Let 's go . THEY follow CAPTAIN KIDD and YAHOODI offstage . At this point the fight has reached its climax , and MARLENE is winning . SHE has GHOST GIRL by the throat . GHOST GIRL collapses in a heap . MARLENE pulls herself together . SHE looks around the stage . MARLENE DIETRICH It 's always been this way . Right from the start . Always left behind . Always left in the lurch . I guess I 'm just a born loser . PAUL BUNYAN enters.Oh , it 's you again . You with the mysterious eyes . Have you found your Babe ? p. 47 PAUL BUNYAN Nope . I 've just about given up hope . MARLENE DIETRICH Oh , no . Never give up . Never say no to life . Come with me . We 'll find your Babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ? MARLENE DIETRICH I 'm sure of it . PAUL BUNYAN Boy , lady , you sure are one hunk a woman . I could almost forget my ox for you . MARLENE DIETRICH Let 's go away together . THEY exit . WACO starts to come to . HE shakes his head and sits up , feeling drunk . HE looks out over the audience . WACO ( sings ) I been fightin ' like a lion.But I 'm ' fraid I 'm gon na lose . What happened to my hat ? I had me a hat . Given to me special . Ca n't see nothin ' but ocean . Nothin ' but the deep blue sea . Ca n't figure out this life . Here one minute , gone the next . Just a space traveler . Just a driftin' ' fool . Wake up in the mornin ' and find yerself in the ocean . Now ai n't that the damn truth . ( HE notices the GHOST GIRL and goes to her ) Well now , lookit that . A fair young maiden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . Listen to me . I 'm so lonely and hungry for love that my stomach is stranglin ' my backbone . And that 's the truth . Feel like a mule driver eatin ' nothin ' but borax for a mile . Listen to me , honey . ( HE sits down next to her and strokes her hair ) Oh , my heart 's just about ripped wide open just from the sight of somethin ' like you . Yessir . Good thing yer unconscious to this babble . You would n't believe the journeys I 've made . You would n't believe . Say , if I told ya a secret you would n't tell nobody , would ya ? It 's somethin ' I 've been savin ' up fer a long , long time . I never told it to nobody before . I 'm the real Jimmie Rodgers . That 's right . It 's me . He lives in me , that 's how I figure I 'm him . Same thing as though he 'd never died at all . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how that is . A man gets into yer soul . Same as a woman or a piece a land . He 's alive in me . And that 's how I 'm gon na put him back on the street . He died too fast . A man like that just does n't come and go . He lives on . He lives in yer heart . He 's alive right now . Can ya hear him ? Listen : " I been fightin ' like a lion . / But I 'm ' fraid I 'm gon na lose . " Ya hear that ? He 's in there . I know it 's him . It 's got ta be him . It ai n't me , that 's for sure . It sure ai n't me . ( HE takes off his boots ) My mind 's as raggedy and tore up as this old pair a boots . Nothin ' holdin ' it together no more . Not even the desire left . Just follow yer heart . That 's what I say . Follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world right into the next . I got no expectations . The world 's a motherfucker , boy . I got nowheres to go and nothin ' to see . Nowheres . And that 's the truth . The lights dim out. @x The lights come up on YAHOODI and CAPTAIN KIDD sitting by a campfire with two big bags full of gold . CAPTAIN KIDD I ca n't understand it . How they coulda found it in the first place . How they coulda got past the ghost girl . And how come they left two bags behind . I just ca n't understand it . YAHOODI You sure you ai n't holding out on me now ? CAPTAIN KIDD Now laddie , why would I even have asked ye to come along with me in the first place if I was plannin ' on doublecrossin ' ye ? YAHOODI Yeah . Well , I 'm thankful that we got out of there with our skins . Those natives were getting pretty fierce . These two bags should last us quite a while if we play our cards right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's enough in this bag to see out the rest of my days . YAHOODI Yeah , well , you 're an old man . Me , I got my whole life in front of me . I wan na live high . I wan na live real high . CAPTAIN KIDD Sure puzzles me what coulda happened to Miss Marlene . Unless that ghost girl dragged her off into the woods . YAHOODI Maybe the natives got her . p. 50 CAPTAIN KIDD She was such a fine woman . YAHOODI She was all right . CAPTAIN KIDD But I thought you loved her . YAHOODI We had an understanding . That 's all . Just an understanding . CAPTAIN KIDD Boy , if I had a woman like that I 'd tie her to my waist and never let her out of my sight . YAHOODI Shhh ! What 's that ! ( HE stands and listens to the space . Silence ) CAPTAIN KIDD You herein ' things again ? There ai n't nothin ' out there but the wilds . YAHOODI There 's something out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following us ever since we left the jungle . I can feel it . A presence . Something real . Maybe it 's Kosmo . Maybe he 's been dogging my trail all this time . ( HE calls across a vast expanse ) Kosmo ! CAPTAIN KIDD Listen , son . I got an idea . How ' bout if the two of us broke up and went our separate ways ? We got nothin ' more to do with each other . It 's time we followed our own paths . YAHOODI Broke up ? Oh , no . I get it . You wan na get me out there alone in the jungle . You know the jungle and I do n't . That 's it , is n't it ? You wan na come sneaking up on me and bump me off and take my half of the treasure . Is n't that the truth ? p. 51 CAPTAIN KIDD After all we been through ? After all that , you can say something like that to me ? YAHOODI Maybe you got a deal worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and meet him , and then the two of ya do me in . Maybe that 's it . Maybe he 's out there right now . Just waiting for your signal . Just waiting for me to fall asleep . CAPTAIN KIDD Now slow down , kid . You 've got the fever . Yer mind 's been twisted up . YAHOODI pulls a gun on CAPTAIN KIDD . YAHOODI Oh no ! Not this time . This time the tables are turned . It 's me who 's gon na take over . It 's me who 's gon na take your half and leave you in the lurch . Now hand it over ! Come on ! Hand it over ! CAPTAIN KIDD hands over his bag of the treasure . CAPTAIN KIDD You 're makin ' a big mistake , laddie . I have no evil in my heart for you . YAHOODI You think I 'm falling for that goodness and kindness routine , you 're crazy . This is my show and I 'm running it my way . Now turn around ! Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back and leave me here to die . YAHOODI I ca n't , huh ? Just watch me . You have n't got the guts to do it . You 're so moral and self-righteous you could n't pull the trigger . Is n't that right ? Well , not me , Captain Kidd . I 'm gon na blow your brains out . KOSMO 's voice comes from offstage as if from many miles away . YAHOODI turns toward the sound . p. 52 KOSMO Yahoodi ? YAHOODI Kosmo ? That you ? You 're out there . I know you 're out there . You 're trying to drive me crazy . But I 'm too smart for that . I got the upper hand . You 're not going to get away with it . I 'm going to win ! CAPTAIN KIDD springs on YAHOODI . THEY struggle with the gun . CAPTAIN KIDD finally grabs it away from him and points it in his face . CAPTAIN KIDD Now get up ! YAHOODI stands . CAPTAIN KIDD covers him with the gun . YAHOODI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Kidd ? CAPTAIN KIDD Looks that way , does n't it ? YAHOODI What 're ya gon na do now ? You ca n't shoot me ' cause you have n't got the guts . You ca n't leave me here to die in the jungle because your conscience would n't let you . So it looks like you 'll have to take me with you . CAPTAIN KIDD It looks that way . YAHOODI And sooner or later you 're gon na have to sleep . Sooner or later the tables will turn again . CAPTAIN KIDD Time will tell that tale . Now come on , we 're movin ' out into the desert . THEY travel to the desert . KOSMO and MAE enter from the opposite side . KOSMO yells across a great expanse . p. 53 KOSMO Yahoodi ! MAE WEST Pipe down . What do you wan na do , let the whole jungle know we 're here ? KOSMO I do n't care anymore . I do n't care about the treasure or the natives or anything .

KOSMO But where 'd he go ? Where 's my friend ? Where 's Yahoodi ? Where 's all the people I love ? I ca n't hear the music anymore . I ca n't hear the band . MAE WEST Stop blubbering . Once we get that treasure I 'll buy you a dozen bands . KOSMO I want my band . I do n't want a dozen bands . I just wan na play my music . My own special music . MAE WEST Oh , if I just had me a man . A real man . We could rip off this treasure and have us a ball . But now I get strapped with a kid . A rock-and-roll punk . KOSMO ( calling across a great expanse ) Yahoodi ! I had a vision ! Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin and Buddy Holly and Sam Cooke and Big Bopper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blind Lemon Jefferson ! They 're all in heaven and they 've started a band ! Yahoodi ! Can you hear me ? p. 54 MAE WEST You 've flipped your cake , buster . You 've really gone bananas . KOSMO I wan na go home . I wan na see my wife and kids again . MAE WEST So , now you 're a married man . KOSMO Sure , what 's so strange about that ? MAE WEST What about all them groupies ? All them group gropes ? The string of broken hearts from here to Tupelo ? KOSMO You 're making that up . You 're trying to drive me crazy . Once I thought I loved you . MAE WEST You ai n't the first man to spit out them words . Listen , honey , I wan na live high . I mean really high . You think I wan na spend the rest of my life in the jungle ? KOSMO Look at me . I was living high . I was living in wall-to-wall carpets with color TVs and all the dope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name in all the papers . Look where I am now . The same place as you . So what 's the difference ? You want what I have and I want what you have and we both have each other . MAE WEST You 're confusin ' my mind . I 'm a simple gal . I do n't like talkin ' in riddles . KOSMO What 's gon na happen when we do find Yahoodi ? We steal his treasure and then what ? p. 55 MAE WEST We hit all the big ones . St. Louis , New Orleans , San Francisco , Baton Rouge . We wine and dine with the best of ' em . We knock ' em dead with our glitter . Folks 'll say , " Who 's that couple ? They sure do know how to live . " KOSMO But I 'm a country boy .

I do n't know where to start . We do n't even have a compass . I 'm lost . We 're both lost . MAE WEST I know exactly where I 'm going , honey . And it ai n't to the poorhouse .

JESSE JAMES Well , let 's take a look . MAE WEST Okay by me . THEY dump the contents of the bags out on the floor . Tons of bottle caps come crashing out . MAE and JESSE stare at the bottle caps for a minute , then at each other . JESSE JAMES Bottle caps . Millions of bottle caps . MAE WEST Well , like they say .
