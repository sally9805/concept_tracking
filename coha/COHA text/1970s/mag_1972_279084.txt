With four children and no college degree , Richard Cardinal saw little chance of escaping from the Ford assembly line where he had started working in 1955 . " I had always wanted to study , " says the burly ex-union official , now 35 , " but money problems and the job did n't allow me to do it . " <P> Until recently , Cardinal might have taken a few night school or correspondence courses , but never earned a degree . Last fall he discovered that he could earn that degree from Empire State College , part of the State University of New York , without ever setting foot in a classroom . Now when he is not working on the assembly line in Albany , Cardinal combs through union archives , reads labor history and interviews co-workers-all part of his major in labor relations , a program that has been especially designed to fit both his interests and his work schedule . <P> More and more educators are coming to believe that a college education need not take place in a classroom or follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adults , as well as young people , are eager to study but can not get to college . The solution : a college education without a college . The best known of such experimental programs opened last year : the University Without Walls ( U.W.W. ) -a joint effort by 20 colleges based at Antioch College in Yellow Springs , Ohio - and Empire State College in New York . Similar courses will start this fall at universities in California , Maryland , New Jersey and Texas . <P> All aim , as Empire State President James W. Hall says , " to step aside from the subtle tyrannies that have existed in education . " Empire State , for example , has no campus , no classrooms , laboratories or libraries-just 400 students who pay up to $1,067 a year in tuition to be guided in their studies by advisers based in five cities . These advisers , known as " mentors , " help each student to work out a program that can include independent study , tutorial conferences or formal courses on any of the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college expects to have up to 7,000 students . Explains Vice President Arthur Chickering : " We are trying to find a way to make education more accessible and more flexible according to a student 's strengths , weaknesses and aspirations . " <P> Such an approach allows Empire State to enroll students like Jim Walsh , 24 , who hates classrooms and is earning degree credits by working at an Indian archaeological dig near Saratoga ; Steve Hasso , 17 , who is studying literature , history and political science to supplement his senior year in high school ; and Mary Ellen Musgrave , 28 , who found nursing so intellectually unchallenging that she is now studying philosophy , art and music , and will receive her bachelor 's degree next month . Perhaps more typical is Auto Worker Cardinal , who wants to " understand what it is that makes our lives miserable as workers , " but also expects his degree to help him get a better job . He vows : " I 'm going to get that B.A. It 's my last shot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
