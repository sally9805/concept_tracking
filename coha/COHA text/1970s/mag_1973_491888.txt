by Jack Seville Driving along AlA toward Nettles Island , Florida , I struggled to reconstruct the couplet that goes something like : The only difference between men and boys Is the price they pay for their toys . At the time , I was heading for a rally of some 800 motor homes , and had visions of 800 senior citizens pitching horseshoes and competing in silly-hat contests , their ladies swapping recipes for meatless casseroles . Heavily under the influence of such preconceived ideas , I completed the quatrain with : When they acquire those toys , what are their aims ? The big boys with toys play little boys ' games . What I found at the Outdoor Resorts of America campground was poetic justice  --  a triumph for the other side . Those self-contained motor homes are indeed expensive  --  from $10,000 to ten times $10,000 ? but they 're more than toys for big boys . Their owners are pleasure seeking , but they take motor camping seriously . Restless Americans , always in thrall to wheels and roads on which to roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living arrangements . By combining motoring and camping they 've created a new phenomenon  --  the recreational vehicle , with three million of them crowding the highways this year . They range from low-silhouette trailers which open up to a family-size tent , to Pullman-like accommodations loaded on the bed of a pick-up truck , to deluxe travel trailers and self-propelled motor homes boasting their own heat , light , water , range , refrigerator . full bath and a holding tank to contain their sewage . To take care of all of these recreational vehicles ( more familiarly Rec Vees or RVs ) unused pastures and clearings are being converted to RV campgrounds . These specialized parking lots offer a level parking pad and individual hookups for fresh water , electricity and sewage disposal ; sometimes even telephone and cable TV connections . For those traveling in Spartan conveyances , there are public toilets and showers . Additional support facilities include laundry , grocery counter and refreshment vending machines . A recent development has been destination campgrounds where the operators offer enough added inducements  --  like horseback riding , swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration of their vacation . Now there are condominium campsites like the Nettles Island complex which was developed by Outdoor Resorts of America and comprises more than 1500 parking sites , some of them with frontage on the Indian River Intracoastal Waterway . Who are these RV travelers ? They 're not gypsies . They are just Mr. and Mrs. Average , from Middle America . According to the Recreational Vehicle Institute , spokesman for the industry , the average RV owner is middle-aged , well employed and spends thirty-four days a year traveling in his vehicle . Contrary to a misconception which has fostered some local legislation to ban parking RVs in private driveways , these are not a cheap solution to expensive travel . They are expensive to buy and to maintain . Their attraction is mainly the freedom they offer in the selection of route , destination , mealtime and bedtime  --  all with familiar homelike surroundings . With the possible exception of those who use their vehicles only in the pursuit of other activities , such as hunting , fishing or skiing , the one common denominator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trait allows them to happily transcend bumper-to-bumper traffic to reach fender-to-fender parking in sun-baked lots . Their investment in equipment is equal to that of a small boat or even a good-sized yacht , which would entitle them to similar traffic jams on the waterways and gunwale-to-gunwale docking in crowded marinas . Because they are sociable , most of their travel is in groups . Their campouts are steeped in an atmosphere of nostalgia . Caravans , led by a wagon master , are reminiscent of the trek West . And like the Conestoga wagons , they are drawn up together at night , when conditions permit , almost automatically into a circle . Their activities are communal  --  from sharing pot-luck meals featuring baked beans and potato salad to amateur entertainment and group singing around an evening campfire . It 's all good , clean fun and a wholesome leveling process , for the participants come from all walks of life representing the broadest cross-section of middle America . While it is all very harmless and in good fun , some of these rallies leave the local citizenry with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not a fault , might be laid to overenthusiasm by promotion-minded entrepreneurs . For the most part , RV travel clubs have been factory inspired . Manufacturers , eager to promote their brand names , were matched in their exuberance only by the burgeoning growth of their infant industry . By accentuating the hi-jinx , some tended to obscure the solid needs of RV travelers . To foster brand loyalty and tighten the bond , clubs sponsored by manufacturers usually publish a club news bulletin in which they can disseminate the company line , as well as offer travel information , tips , editorials , and notices of scheduled rallies or proposals of future rally sites . Club services sometimes include mail forwarding , trip routing , group insurance rates , and reduced prices on accessories they are able to purchase in quantity . Frequent rallies are held locally , by state or regional chapters , climaxed by an annual national rally . In addition to such standard fixtures as talent contests , costume parties , teen-queen pageants , horseshoe pitching , tugs-of-war and entertainment for the kids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing . Some include exhibitions , instruction and contests in hobbies and crafts . All of this togetherness began as a canny promotion scheme , when travel trailers were somewhat of a novelty and the devotees something of a rarity . Recognizing a bond of mutuality , even exclusivity , and innate gregariousness . Wally Byam , of Airstream trailer fame , established himself as the wagon master of the Twentieth Century . Under the exhortations of the charismatic Byam , owners of the easily identifiable Airstream trailers willingly submitted to benevolent regimentation by displaying identification numbers ( the lower the number , the more prestigious it is ) and wearing prescribed blue berets . Early in their travels advance notice was given so that merchants knew and properly welcomed the caravanners who came to town in sleek silver trailers , wore berets and spent lots of silver dollars buying souvenirs and stocking their traveling homes . But that all began in 1955 when annual production of travel trailers was under 15,000 . Nowadays more than that are built each month , and they are joined by nearly twice as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickup covers and motor homes ) . Last year a total of 724,000 RVs were sold . Although Wally Byam died in 1962 , the Airstream Company continues to sponsor regional rallies and caravans to Mexico , Canada and Alaska , and occasional caravans abroad . These are open to any owner of an Airstream trailer . Meanwhile , other manufacturers have hired company pitchmen to serve as a new breed of wagon master . Some of them are trainees from Wally Byam 's promotions , and know how to nurture the latent herd instinct of RV owners . No matter what brand of RV you might purchase , chances are the manufacturer sponsors some sort of travel club and can put you in touch with a local chapter . Membership in Airstream 's Wally Byam Caravan Clubs still outnumbers all others . But Winnebago , which now leads in sales of RVs , is close behind with their three-year-old club . Their latest membership count reached 10,545 active members . Winnebago International Travelers has auxiliary clubs in thirty-four states , plus sixty-eight local chapters and twenty-three youth auxiliary groups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in their RVs year round . Typical of most company-sponsored travel clubs , purchasers of new Winnebagos are offered membership for a one-time initiation fee of $5 and first year 's dues of $10 . Thereafter the yearly renewal is $10 . Usually the dealer " treats " his customer to the first year 's dues and initiation fee . Social memberships are available to those who have rented a Winnebago camper coach , travel trailer or motor home for a minimum of 10 days in a calendar year . Early attempts to pattern travel clubs after the great god Byam seemed to accentuate the provincialisms but the current trend is toward a more meaningful organization . Recognizing that some owners are actually hesitant about traveling to far-off places alone , organizers are making more efforts toward strengthening the travel-service aspect . Caravans and tours , led by experienced travelers. visit Hawaii , Alaska , Canada and Mexico as well as Europe , Scandinavia and South America . Additional services now include money-saving group rates for insurance , discount purchases , and a stronger voice in solving problems of restrictive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club groups have long-range plans for wholly owned campgrounds where members are assured space available . These advances are being made while continuing to cater to the need for fellowship among those having common interests . By displaying their clublogos and registration number it is easy for members on the road to identify fellow members from directory lists . Sensing the power of the growing numbers of recreational vehicle owners  --  purchasing power and lobbying power  --  the newest breed of ambitious promoter has been attempting to erect umbrellas under which he can martial all the forces and all the brand names . One such group is the Family Motor Coach Association which engineered the 10th annual motor home rally at Nettles Island . This event was billed as a " Fun and Service " rally . The service aspect was provided by the motor companies : Chrysler Corporation , which supplies something like 85 percent of all motor home chassis , Chevrolet , Ford and International Harvester . In addition , several of the larger manufacturers of coaches and a number of suppliers of components were on hand . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought along crews of mechanics to perform warranty work and minor repairs . All in all , a boon to RV owners who frequently do not understand all the sophisticated engineering of their units . For fun and games , members were offered tours to nearby attractions such as Lion Country Safari , Cape Kennedy , Disney World and to local golf courses . Because of financial support from sponsoring members of the industry , RV owners paid only $30 per motor home . For this they were entitled to six nights of space usually renting for $7.50 per night , all resort activities , four nights of professional entertainment and a chicken-and-ribs barbecue on the last night . Family Motor Coach Association has been capitalizing on the gregarious theme for ten years , with a membership of 10,000 motor home owners organized into twenty-two chapters to show for it . Their local chapters may hold twenty rallies a year , bringing together anywhere from a dozen to a couple of hundred units for purely social activities . While the local rallies give owners an opportunity to take relatively short weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national rallies bring them together with the manufacturers of the equipment they use . Such co-mingling of supplier and user is mutually beneficial . What appears to be a major contribution is about to be launched by the FMCA . A pilot course of instruction is now being tested . Patterned after the successful Power Squadron course in small boat handling , they will offer a training program consisting of one night a week for four weeks . The primary purpose is to teach safety ; hopefully , one of the fringe benefits will he a further reduction in insurance rates for those who complete the course . Glenn Reed , head of FMCA can properly be called an organizer . Here 's a man well-versed in the ties that bind . He sees strength in numbers and considers his organization a catalyst . " Our future , " he says , " lies in the education of drivers and as a watch dog on restrictive legislation and unfair taxation of the vehicles .
