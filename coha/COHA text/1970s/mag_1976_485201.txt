the dump burning at the tip of the island . Kwajalein lies 8 miles away , around the lagoon from Ebeye . Its lush green golf course is just one of the amen  --  ities provided for the military and its families ; there are also spacious parks and baseball fields , free movies , hand  --  ball courts , swimming pools , numerous tennis and basket  --  ball courts , a community center and a scout but for the young people ; air-conditioned houses with neat lawns and shady fenced yards , beautiful beaches , coconut and other trees for relief from the tropical sun , top-flight schools and a hospital for good medical care . All these are part of life for the 3,000 Americans on Kwajalein . Ebeye , twenty-five minutes away by ferry , has the high  --  est population density in the Pacific . But , in contrast to the abundant sports and recreational facilities on Kwaja  --  lein , Ebeye has almost none . For the thousands of young people on the island there are one and a half basketball courts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children play on the sewage outran pipe above the narrow beach , where the outhouses crowd be  --  tween the high-water mark and the shabby housing . The pre-school is in a small old wooden building ; the elementary school is more wooden buildings and eight classrooms in a cement-block annex . Together they pro  --  vide barely enough space for half the children , and hun  --  dreds of children wander the island in aimless groups during the day . Workers who want their older children to go to intermediate or high school must send them to the district center at Majuro ( $53.80 one way ) . Many can not , of course , and 12-to-16-year-olds hang around and drink beer  --  there 's nothing else to do . No Marshallese may live on Kwajalein , but more than 500 work there , at service and maintenance jobs for the military and its families . Workers who make the ferry trip each morning must be off Kwajalein by 9 P.M. The menial jobs necessary to keep a military base clean and trim and functioning pay the Marshallese at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average wage is $3.15 . With this the breadwinner must feed ten to twenty people at Ebeye prices , which are high for the scanty supplies of canned fish and vegetables , soda pop and candy in small shops . Shopping at low military PX prices on Kwajalein is closed to Marshallese . Even to go to the places on Kwajalein where they are allowed , such as the airport or post office , the Marshallese must first fill out an application and receive a permit from the office of the District Administrator on Ebeye . And the free ferry runs only at the hours when the workers com  --  mute  --  otherwise , the water taxi costs $1 each way . Most of the trees on Ebeye have been cut down and the houses crowded in . The government supplies 308 one-room units , each housing a family , in one-story dingy , unpainted cement-block structures . The other half of the housing is shabby wooden houses and shacks . From ten to twenty people live in each of the one- and two-room houses . Perhaps as many as two-thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean they have hot water or toilets or showers ? " running water " may simply mean a faucet outside the house . There are no outhouses on Kwajalein ; the government supplies indoor bathrooms with hot water , and air condi  --  tioning as well . From the nameplate next to every door , it appears that only one family lives in each house . U.N . and other studies expose the critical health and sanitation conditions on Ebeye . A recent report called Ebeye " a biological time bomb waiting to go off . " Yet there is only one doctor for the 7,000 people on the island , and doctors on Kwajalein are prohibited from volunteering to serve on Ebeye . This is South Africa in the Pacific , but not yet Soweto . With the Marshallese totally dependent on dollars spent by the U.S. military , complaints about health conditions are rarely heard . The U.N . Trusteeship Agreement calls for the United States to promote the economic , educational and social advancement of the inhabitants and to protect the " rights and fundamental freedoms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thirty years of destructive American action in the Marshall Islands , from the Bikini bomb tests to apartheid on Ebeye , have forced the Mar  --  shallese into dependence on this degrading source of in  --  come , with what Senator Kabua calls " all the ills of the ghetto " and no chance for economic development . The Marshalls will never develop toward " ' self-government or independence " as specified in the U.N . Agreement if they have no choice but to clean up after the military at the Kwajalein Missile Range . q You might have supposed that the press conference to announce the sale of The Observer , one of London 's two mos$ important serious Sunday newspapers , to a subsid  --  iary of an American oil company , would have had some  --  thing of the atmosphere of a wake , at least for those who were being forced to sell . Far from it . Those who might have been expected to mourn made no effort to conceal their jubilation . And the reasons for their almost unseemly mood of self-congratulation reveal a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people who run many British institutions , and that , in turn , explains a good deal about the country 's plight . The conference was held in the Domino room of the Caf6 Royal , a few steps from Piccadilly Circus . At the middle of the long table sat Lord Goodman , a corpulent , cross-looking solicitor who is the Master of University College , Oxford , and chairman not only of The Observer but also until recently of the Newspaper Proprietors ' Asso  --  ciation , which might unkindly be described as the British press lords ' cartel . No social landscape of London in the last ten years would be complete without the vast figure of Arnold Goodman . He is an intimate of former Prime Minister Harold Wilson , a skillful fund raiser and a subtle negotiator , man of confidence to an astonishingly high proportion of the diminishing band of London 's wealthy and great , and a man of secrets in a society obsessed with secrecy . On Goodman 's right was Douglass Cater . As the Man who had arranged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober demeanor . Son of an Alabama lawyer , even at Harvard his orotund manner earned him the nickname of " the Jedge . " As Washington correspondent of The Reporter in the late 1950s and early 1960s , the same manner had earned Cater the confidence of Southern Senators , and his Reporter work won him a place in Lyndon Johnson 's White House . Since then , he has been director of something called the " Thought Leading to Action Program on Communications and Society " of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies , moving amiably and fluently between his home on the Stanford campus at Palo Alto , an office on Fifth Avenue in New York , richly decorated with modern paintings and tapestries , outposts in Tokyo and Berlin , and the headquarters of this cultural multinational in Aspen , Colo . There , amid the summer Rockies , corporate statesmen are introduced to a somewhat bland intellectual diet . Next to Cater sat David Astor , the man who was actually selling The Observer  --  though so coarsely direct a way of describing the transaction may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he retired from the editorship . It was exclusively as editor of the paper that he liked to be known , though in fact he was virtually its owner . His grandfather bought it shortly after he ar  --  rived in Britain from the United States . Some emphasis has been laid on the fact that the Astor family transferred the duty of deciding who should be the editor to an Editorial Trust . It was far less widely known that there was in fact another trust , the Publishing Trust , which owned most of the common stock on behalf of the Astors . Whatever the legal or public relations niceties , the plain fact is that David Astor and his family owned The Observer until they chose to sell it to Robert Orville Anderson and Atlantic Richfield . Next to Astor sat Kenneth Harris , a veteran of The Observer whose cri de coeur to his old friend Cater brought Robert Anderson and ARCO galloping to the rescue . The paper 's present editor , Donald Trelford ; its business manager ; a friendly newspaper owner ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ com  --  pany at the high table . Something of these people 's attitudes to the reporter 's trade , which is after all the basic activity on which all their more amusing or rewarding occupations depend , was unconsciously revealed by the atmosphere of the press conference . Lord Goodman repeatedly tried to bringthe proceedings to a close , though the reporters stilt had plenty of questions to ask . In particular , they under  --  standably pressed to know what the selling price had been . Since it is said that The Observer , with all its near two centuries of glorious history , its two-thirds of a million readers , its plant , its advertising and its talented staff was sold  --  no doubt for good lawyers ' reasons  --  for exactly one solitary , devalued pound sterling , these questions can hardly be said to have been devoid of legitimate interest . But Goodman repeatedly and testily refused to answer questions about the price . He took little trouble to conceal his contempt for men reduced to earning their living by asking questions about other people 's business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word  --  in dealing with reporters was revealing enough . What was even more extraordinary was the open glee with which all concerned accepted the deal . The Observer 's independ  --  ence had been saved , they kept repeating , as though it had been delivered from a fate worse than death . Its independence has been saved ? the reporters asked in  --  credulously . By selling it ? To a foreign oil company ? Well , yes , the answer kept coming back in variants : you see , Robert Anderson is such a terrifically good chap . This strain was further elaborated in the next edition of the paper . " Oil Men with a Conscience , " ran the head  --  line on a profile of Anderson and ARCO by the paper 's Los Angeles correspondent . Next to it was a half-page , two-column cut of Anderson , up to his knees in a moun  --  tain stream , in waders and a ten-gallon hat : an ad for Marlboro country . " Robert 0 . Anderson , " ran the caption under this obsequious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The quotation was taken from a Mr. Thornton Brad , shaw , the president of Atlantic Richfield , who seems to know which side his scope is buttered on . Why were David Astor and his colleagues so very delighted to sell to Anderson and ARCO ? Why were they so very sure that the deal with ARCO guaranteed the paper 's independence ? Relief , gratitude , a courteous acceptance of new partners : these would all be normal where a long-established institution had been going through hard times , and had suddenly found an answer to its financial problems . But why such positive , unmistakable glee ? Why such naive dismissal of the very idea that an oil company might have a self-interested motive in buying a newspaper ? Why , in one short , rude phrase , such enthusiasm for selling out ? Their own explanation is plausible enough , on the surface . " When it first became known that The Observer was seeking outside financial support , " the paper 's edi  --  torial began , " we stressed that those concerned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But that language needs a translation . For " seek to preserve its editorial character , " read " go to any lengths to avoid having anyone who knew anything about newspapers coming in and making us change the way we 've been running the show like a family sweet shop for the last twenty years . " And to understand why they felt that so strongly , it is necessary to understand at least in outline how The Observer 's troubles arose , and what alternatives the Astor family and its retainers faced . ( Continued on page 688 ) also the year when I was subpoenaed by the House Com  --  mittee on Un-American Activities , which was currently ferreting out subversive musicians ? I suppose because it had run out of more newsworthy game . Naturally I talked to a lawyer , and to friends who had been through the un-American mill . What they told me boiled down to this : " The first thing they 'll ask is , are you or were you ever a Communist . If you say no , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'll then order you to name every other Communist you ever knew . If you refuse , you go to jail for contempt of Congress . " This was a tough one . Having no lust for martyrdom , jail did not attract me  --  especially with a sick wife and a new baby at home . On the other hand , though I was perfectly willing to answer for myself , I was damned if I would put the finger on others  --  people who had done me no harm , had to my knowledge done nothing criminal , and who , if fingered , would probably be harassed , legally or otherwise . There was , I was told , an alternative : I could refuse to answer any questions , on one of two grounds  --  the First ( free-speech ) Amendment , or the Fifth ( self-in  --  crimination ) Amendment . " Taking the First " would mean a long and expensive court fight , and perhaps jail any  --  way ; " taking the Fifth " would put me home free . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor man 's Amendment . " I was a poor man ; I took it . In actual fact , I took what we musicians called - the " diminished Fifth " : I swore I had not been a Communist for five years , but declined to answer further . Later that same year , I quit music for editorial work , getting a low-paid but fairly responsible job on a major encyclopedia . Six weeks later I was told , with no warn  --  ing whatever , that I was fired as of that afternoon . When I asked why , I was told only that ly " lacked maturity of judgment . " The pattern  --  instant dismissal on vague grounds  --  was suspiciously similar to that of other political The Observer ( Continued from page 679 ) Until the last few years the paper was a modestly profitable business , but it had had structural problems for some time . Like so much else in Britain , these are hard to understand unless you know the history , and even if you do you are left wondering why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Times of London and Sunday Times belong to the same manage  --  ment , the Thomson Organization . You would expect them to have been printed on the same presses , and The Ob  --  server to be paired up with the Guardian , which shares its general Left-of-Center liberal stance . But you would be wrong . The Observer was printed on the Times 's presses ; the Guardian ( until recently ) at the Sunday Times . So when , two years ago , the Times moved out of its time-honored site at Printing House Square to a new plants next to the Sunday Times , The Observer was left orphaned . It had to raise the money to buy the Times site . Then came the economic crisis after the oil price rise in the fall of 1973 . Like every other Fleet Street paper , The Observer was squeezed between rising wages , risingcal firings I had heard about ; suspicion became certainty when my boss 's secretary reported him as saying that " Claiborne was a victim of his past . " After some months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I moved to another magazine where in three years I rose , to be managing editor  --  a record which I think disposes of any possibility that the original firing was for incompetence rather than politics . In 1964 , I moved again , this time to a major publishing complex as an executive editor . A year later I was again fired without warning , and on equally nebulous grounds : after hemming and hawing , my boss declared that " If you have to ask what you did wrong , that proves you 're not the right man for the job . " He never did say what I had " done wrong " ; me ? I knew . Some weeks later , the grapevine again pro  --  vided confirmation . That was one man 's blacklist . It hurt me far less than it did many others . Although I twice went through some lean months , each time I eventually landed on my feet . Nonetheless , I was twice penalized  --  surreptitiously  --  without being convicted , or even accused , of anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the un-American committee , showed the slightest interest in that . It was not for being a Communist , which I had sworn I was not , nor even for being a " Com-symp , " which a glance at my published writings would have shown I was not . It was simply because , five ( or thirteen ) years earlier , I had been a member of an organization which , whatever its defects ( and it had plenty ) was a legal political group  --  and had refused to finger other people guilty of the same " crime . " paper costs , and falling advertising revenue . Unlike al  --  most all the rest , it was also on its own , without diversi  --  fied assets in newspapers elsewhere in the world or in non-newspaper investments . ( Though The Observer does have one valuable asset which might have been sold and was not : a block of stock in highly profitable London Weekend Television . This presumably still belongs to the Publishing Trust , and so to the Astor family . ) By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straits . A quarter of the staff were persuaded to accept " voluntary redundancy " : in other words , to quit to save the paper . Characteristically , it was the younger profes  --  sional journalists who left , and the nucleus of older writers , many of them , to put it charitably , stiff in the intellectual joints , and all of them personal cronies of David Astor , who stayed . Less characteristically  --  for , whatever his faults , Astor is generally a charitable and a kind man  --  he announced on TV that the talented young men and women who had given up their jobs to save his paper were " the ones the paper can do without ! " That did n't save the paper , though . At one time or another from the mid-1960s on , The Observer held talks with most of the major publishing groups in Britain . There was even a secret Cabinet subcommittee to discuss which groups could be allowed to own such an influential British paper as The Observer . Finally , this September , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  man , the paper 's manager , Roger Harrison , approached Rupert Murdoch . It is that move , indirectly , which ex  --  plains the grins at the Caf ? Royal . Rupert Murdoch is an Australian . More than that , he is a tough-talking , abrasive Australian . His father once controlled a paper in Melbourne , but the family interests were kicked out of it by a coup before Rupert was old enough to do anything about it . He seems to have ac  --  quired from that experience a fierce , Horatio Alger-like determination to " show them " by making good on his own . When , this November , still in his mid-40s , he bought the New York Post , it was his eighty-seventh newspaper , in Australia , Britain and the United States . And , with the single exception of The Australian , his Canberra-based flagship and Australia 's first national newspaper , which has lost money steadily since he founded it in 1965 , all Murdoch 's papers make money hand over fist . They do it by unsentimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they want . " To judge from The News of the World and The Sun in London , the Daily Mirror in Sydney and The News in San Antonio , Texas , Mur  --  doch and his men are confident that what the public wants is lots of sex , lots of crime and lots of pi77117 , Murdoch was by no means the only contender for The Observer 's hand . There were offers from Sally Aw Kian , heiress of the Tiger Balm patent medicine fortune , who owns several papers in Hong Kong ; from Olga Deterding , whose father founded Royal Dutch , and left her ? .23 million ; and from two former Labour mem  --  bers of Parliament , Robert Maxwell and Woodrow Wyatt , the latter apparently with Arab backing . The Observer people , revealingly , approached Sir James Goldsmith , the half-French financier whose attitude to the press is best measured by his determined attempt to shut down the satirical magazine Private Eye , whose editor he is trying to send to jail by reviving the half-obsolete offense of criminal libel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie between Murdoch and Vere Harmsworth , scion of the most famous of all the British publishing dynasties , and chairman of Associated Newspapers , which owns the Daily Mail . Harmsworth made no secret of his intentions for The Observer . He wanted to move it " down market , " to com  --  pete with the Sunday Express . It was not a reassuring prospect for those who professed to care about The Observer 's traditional liberal conscience and high stand  --  ards : Harmsworth and the Mail had always been uncom  --  promisingly right wing , and the paper they wanted to compete with , Sir Max Aitken 's Sunday Express , operates on a tired formula of chauvinism , sensationalism and gos  --  sip about duchesses and millionaires . Murdoch , on the other hand , had clearly no motive for taking The Ob  --  server down market . He already owns The News of the World , which is about as down market as you can get , even in the earthy world of the London Sunday papers . He was making all the money he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer him was the respect of his peers in the newspaper business , plus ad  --  ditional printing capacity for his successful papers . Ob  --  viously , he would not want The Observer to lose money , but its losses are not catastrophic , by the standards of a business in which the Times , for example , has lost some ? 2 million a year for a decade . Murdoch proposed to bring in new commercial management and a handful of senior editorial staff to control his investment . But he also planned an increase in editorial space that would have en  --  abled The Observer 's own journalists to do things they had been prevented from doing by the economic squeeze . And so The Observer swallowed hard and approached Murdoch . At one point the negotiations broke down , apparently because the Australian was annoyed by the way the Observer people seemed to be trying to suggest that he was chasing them , when in reality it was the other way round . ( The fact that , unknown to the Lon  --  doners , Murdoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purchase of the New York Post , would seem to confirm his insistence that he had had no intention of getting involved in The Observer until they approached him . ) Did the Observer men consciously use the prospect of a Murdoch takeover , calculated to horrify all Estab  --  lishment-minded persons , as a ploy to scare up rescue bids ? In restrospect , it seems likely . But the logic for choosing Murdoch rather than any of the other known saviors was so compelling that even David Astor seemed to accept it for a moment . The paper quoted him as saying about a deal with Murdoch , " Astor felt it was better to have an efficient Visigoth than nothing at all . " An efficient Visigoth ! The phrase speaks volumes about the pride and prejudice of a man whose own grandfather , arriving in Edwardian England to buy newspapers and status with his Yankee millions , must have been snubbed as a Visigoth until he and his family had learned to out-upper class the upper class . But it also speaks volumes about the instincts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astors , in the third generation , are such representative specimens . No one , certainly , could call David Astor a Visigoth . His style is more that of a late Roman Senator or Em  --  peror : that , for example , of the unfortunate Gratian , of whom it was said that while he wished to devote all his time to alleviating the sufferings of his subjects , " having been bred in the purple , he had never learned what it is to rule , and what to be ruled . " After 1948 , when David Astor took over as editor , The Observer became one of the world 's great newspapers . Its greatest years were those from around 1956 to 1961 , when it was the champion of those who sought to de-colonize the Third World and to modernize British society . With great courage , especially in view of the paper 's staunch sympathy for Israel , it opposed the Anglo-French-Israeli Suez invasion . Reporters like Anthony Sampson and Colin Legum covered Africa more fully and knowl  --  edgeably in The Observer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading up to independence for the British and French colonies . On domestic matters The Observer steadily opposed traditionalism , classism , racism and other brutalities and stupidities of British life ? and did so in a tone of good-humored warmth which helped prepare the minds of a whole generation of the British elite for the cultural revolution of the 1960s . But when that revolution came , The Observer seemed to have lost its tolerance for new ideas . It denounced student demonstrations , sexual liberation , political radi  --  calism and trade union militancy in tones which became increasingly shrill and ultimately almost absurd . What was good about The Observer was David Astor : its amateurishness , its generosity , its high-mindedness , and a brilliant staff , including many refugees from Central Europe . What was bad about it was Astor , too : a certain primness ; the deference toward the rich and powerful ( ex  --  pressed in many ways , but especially in the paper 's ex  --  treme reluctance to undertake investigative journalism just when that became an urgent item in a dangerously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ; its inability to bring in talented people in their 20s and 30s to blend with those in their 50s and 60s ; in brutal summary , its tiredness . It could be argued that such a declension is the in  --  evitable consequence when a newspaper is owned and edited by the same man , who transforms it into an expres  --  sion of his own personality and can not bear to see it in other hands . But there are owner-editors who know when to go . David Astor himself finally went last year ; but after a long and agonized process of choice , his successor turned out to be Donald Trelford , an amiable man who had been Astor 's right-hand man for some years and  --  it can be assumed  --  his preferred heir . What reveals much more than the consequences of personal ownership is the decision to hand the paper over to Atlantic Richfield , rather than to a professional newspaper management like Murdoch 's . And that brings us back to Caf ? Royal . We are asked to believe  --  indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that At  --  lantic Richfield has no ulterior motive in wishing to ac  --  quire and resuscitate The Observer . That must be true , of course . ARCO can have no motive except to make profits for its stockholders . Any activity it engaged in which could be shown not to be conducive to that end would properly be a matter for stockholder suits . The men who control ARCO , on the other hand , may have motives of many kinds . In the case of Robert Ander  --  son , and he seems to have made the decision , we are assured in glowing terms by his ( indirect ) employee Douglass Cater that his motive was the purest altruism . He just wanted to save one of the world 's great news  --  papers . That may be true . On the other hand it may not be the whole truth . It is conceivable that Anderson and his colleagues want to acquire a voice in Britain because they want to be able to influence British Petroleum , which is controlled by the British Government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from B.P. 's operations on the North Slope of Alaska . Or ARCO may feel that owning a major newspaper in London might help it in its bid to win drilling rights in Britain 's rich North Sea offshore fields . After all , the Thomson organization , which owns the Times and Sunday Times ( which last employs me , as it happens ) has a nice stake in North Sea oil . So does Associated Newspapers , which owns the Daily Mail . There are those cynical enough to believe that owning newspapers did not hinderthose companies in their efforts to get in on the North Sea bonanza . Conceivably , too , ARCO might come to feel at some time in the future , when Robert 0 . Ander  --  son was no longer present to banish such an unworthy thought , that ownership of a highly regarded newspaper in London might help it win oil concessions in the Middle East : for ARCO is said to be a crude-hungry company . It is bard for us to know . Oil companies , even those run by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and society , and shed a tear when they hear , in their towers in Los Angeles , of the fall of a journalistic sparrow across the world , do not usually communicate their innermost thoughts about strategy to newspapers , and least of all to newspapers they own . But let us con  --  cede that this is all wide of the mark , the merest Marxist paranoia ; that Robert 0 . Anderson 's motives are indeed as altruistic as Professor Cater assures us ; and that the guarantees in which he will wrap The Observer 's inde  --  pendence do turn out to be as unbreakable as those Astor family trusts from which , we are told , it proved impossible to unlock an alternative source of finance . There still remains the motive of those who were so obviously delighted to sell to a U.S. oil company , rather than to a management with experience in newspapers . It is not seriously possible , in my view , to maintain that Astor and Goodman jumped with such relief into the arms of ARCO because they were afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way that would destroy its quality . For one thing , Murdoch could presumably have been asked for guarantees as much as Anderson . More to the point , Murdoch has no conceiv  --  able interest in acquiring yet another money-spinning , down market Sunday newspaper in London . He , does have a motive for making a quality newspaper into a commercial success and for encouraging it to adapt to the journalistic and social needs of the future . The real clincher was precisely that : because Anderson could afford The Observer as , at best , a rich man 's gesture of noblesse oblige , and , at worst , a public rela  --  tions front , he could afford to leave Astor and Goodman nominally in charge , and with their unsuccessful paper essentially unchanged . Murdoch could not afford such luxuries . He would have had to make the paper succeed both commercially and journalistically . There could hard  --  ly be a clearer instance of the priorities of those who run what is left of capitalism in Britain , or of the role they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They find it easier and less painful to throw themselves on the mercy of a more self-confident ( and less tolerant ) brand of capitalist , if that is the price for avoiding change , than to face the effort of changing what must be changed if British institutions are to survive as living organisms , and not as exhibits in a Californian-owned museum .
