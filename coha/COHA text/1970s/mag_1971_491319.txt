It was late summer and the sun hung red as new blood in the evening sky . Outside his trim , flower-rimmed , four-bedroom home in Woodridge , Illinois ? not far west of Chicago ? Arthur Hoffmeister began loading his wife and five children into the family station wagon , along with his wife 's parents . He was 28 now , a data processor who , less than a year earlier , had been brought to the Chicago area to work near his employer 's headquarters . But he was already much respected in the community as " a good man , and a just . " And on the morrow he and his family would be welcomed formally into the parish church . But tomorrow would never come . As he pulled out onto Wainwright Avenue on this September evening , Arthur Hoffmeister and his family began , unknowingly , a drive toward death . They had gone only a short distance ? north to Maple Avenue , then east toward the city ? when the end came . It came in high style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction behind it so clear and unmistakable that police had little trouble tracing it to its source : a nearby bar . The driver of the convertible had been drinking for a good portion of the afternoon and evening , and when he left that bar he was loaded . He climbed into his convertible ( he 'd just gotten his driver 's license back ) , gunned it as hard as he could , and reeled out into traffic . On Maple Avenue he roared westward through a stoplight , swerved off to the right side of the road and sheared off mailboxes in front of three homes . Then he veered back onto the highway and careened across four lanes of traffic into the farthest lane of oncoming traffic . One driver saw him coming and wrenched his wheel so he could get out of the way . The next car , carrying the Hoffmeisters , did n't have a chance . The convertible was on them too quickly ? at 80 mph . At 7:14 P.M. , the convertible crashed head on into Arthur Hoffmeister 's station wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in a nearby home said , " 1 thought the whole place had exploded . " He rushed outside and found the wreckage of two cars burning . When authorities could get into them , they did not believe the carnage . In that split second of mindless violence , three generations of one family had been wiped out . Five children . Their parents . Their grandparents . Every year , between 25,000 and 30,000 Americans are killed in drunk driving accidents . But even in the bloodiest annals of the killer drunks , this crash was an epic and spectacular chapter . The death toll of ten , including the drunk driver , made it the worst two-car crash in more than a quarter-century . Literally ? and ironically ? the worst such crash in the life span of Arthur Hoffmeister and his wife . It also pointed up one of the most perplexing problems of our times : what to do about the urgent problem of the killer drunk ? One answer : Mounting evidence in ever-developing research is showing us ways to identify who the drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But once you identify him and screen him out , what next ? How do you keep him off the roads ? Do you put him in jail for the rest of his life ? There are n't enough jails in the country to hold all our alcoholics ? eight to ten million of them , 50 times as many of them as there are heroin addicts in the nation . Moreover , excessive drinking is widely accepted as an illness , not a crime ; this nation has gone far beyond the time when it would jail people , as did other societies in the past , because they were ill . What then are the alternatives ? To brand him or his car as dangerous ? To take away his driver 's license until he conquers his drinking problem ? To take away his car as the ultimate way of keeping him off the road ? In the next few pages , you will read of all of this : Of the important new research which allows us to identify a drunk driver and set up an early warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how some people in this nation would rather sacrifice 25,000 to 30,000 lives a year and accept the 800,000 drunk driving accidents that kill and maim ? than take those steps which would protect them from the killer drunk . Of the various proposals for dealing with the drunk driver before he gets a chance to kill . Then you will have a chance to express your views in a special Saturday Evening Post poll . ( See page I 5 1 . ) The scope of the problem is reflected in the crash that took the lives of Arthur Hoffmeister and his family . For investigations after the accident showed not only that their assailant was exceedingly drunk ( his blood contained 21/2 times as much alcohol as needed for a legal definition of drunkenness ) but that he was known to be a problem drinker , and a problem driver . He 'd been convicted ? not just charged ? with eight moving violations , including drunk driving . He 'd been in two auto accidents before the fatal one , and in one of them he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended several times , either for drunk driving or for not having insurance to cover his car accidents . Moreover , he 'd been suffering from a personal sense of frustration which might have caused him to escalate his drinking . At work , he 'd been promised a promotion but never got it . He was 43 , an experienced and knowledgeable printer , and he 'd been passed over at work for a younger man . He became " very depressed , " said his widow , and he began drinking more heavily than ever . Eventually he complained of feeling dizzy , even when sober , and was inclined to attribute it to a head injury suffered in one of his auto accidents . He went to a doctor who examined him , listened to his problems , and passed him along to a specialist . He came under the care of a neurosurgeon who recommended that he take a brain-wave test . On the day before he was to have the test , he went out and got drunk . That was the last time he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And got killed . I f only somebody ? the courts , the state driver's-license authorities , the police , his doctor , his family , even the bartender who fed him his liquor ? had done something , he might have been taken off the highway and given treatment which could have helped him . Instead , nobody bothered to do anything . Except go to the funeral . In this calamity , a tragedy for the guilty as well as the innocent , there was painful confirmation of the vast new insights brought about through relatively recent research on drunk driving . That research indicates powerfully that : The drunk driver is not like most drinkers ; he 's not an occasional or social drinker who enjoys a cocktail party . Instead , the drunk driver is likely to be a dedicated and serious drinker ? a problem drinker , a chronic drinker , an alcoholic . " Alcoholics , that is sick drivers , account for at least 60 percent of alcohol-involved accidents , " Dr. William Haddon Jr. , President of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University College of Medicine puts the figure higher : it reported that known problem drinkers were the root cause of 75 percent of the fatal drunk driving accidents it studied . Research in California showed that alcoholics were four times as likely to be killed in auto accidents as nonalcoholics and were twice as likely to cause all kinds of accidents , fatal and otherwise . A report by doctors at the Missouri Institute of Psychiatry , on more than 700 patients who 'd been hospitalized for alcoholism , showed that 76 percent had been arrested one or more times for traffic violations and that 47 percent of them had already been involved in at least one auto accident caused by their drinking . Moreover , the roots of such alcoholism are deep . A report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association asserts that drunk drivers who cause crashes are three times as likely to have had alcoholic parents as those who do n't drink and do n't cause crashes . " .... In a number of instances , " said the Journal of the AMA , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the client had been diagnosed as alcoholic . " Thus the difference between the drunk driver and the rest of us is both dramatic and generational ? and so profound that no ordinary // driver can look at an accused drunk driver and feel " There but for the grace of God go I. " The drunk driver frequently suffers from mental and emotional problems of which drink is only a part . In Michigan , a study , which probed into fatal auto crashes over a 33-year period , found that 40 percent of the alcoholics in auto accidents also had a history of personal violence ; that one-third of them were clearly depressive ; and that one-sixth of them were subject to strong suicidal drives - hardly a reassuring insight for those of us who believe that we cruise along trouble-free highways . Perhaps a more ominous and significant finding was that half of the alcoholic drivers displayed signs of paranoia before their fatal crash - feelings of intense persecution followed by an uncontrollable rage . In fact , the incidence of paranoia was eight times as high among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do n't get into a fatal crash . The study at Baylor University tended to confirm all this from a slightly different perspective . It showed that all but one of 25 drivers in the accidents studied displayed severe personality disorders and that 80 percent of them displayed psychiatric problems of a clinical nature . They illustrated how one problem leads to another : One driver had a long string of traffic offenses and a long history of marital problems ; he 'd been married and divorced three times by the time he was 43 . He also had many simmering emotional problems , one of which was a pathological sensitivity to whatever his ex-wives said of him . His customary reaction was to fly into an uncontrollable rage and then , when he cooled down , to slip into a suicidal depression . One night he learned that one of his ex-wives had made fun of him ( and presumably of his virility ) before her new boyfriend . His anger rose and he went to a bar and began to drink almost compulsively . That did n't soothe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abruptly , he decided to go see the ex-wife . Once in her apartment , he could n't control his rage . He began beating her mercilessly . When he was done and his high passion was spent , he rushed out of the apartment muttering , " I wish 1 were dead . " Five minutes later , he was . He got into his car , revved it up to 90 mph , and smashed head on into another car - killing himself and the other driver . The killer drunk flashes a great many signs of his various problems before he gets into a car accident . These signals are picked up - but often ignored - by his family , his employer , his doctor , and the people in government . Research in Oakland , California , showed that 80 percent of the drunk drivers arrested had already been brought to the attention of law enforcement and community care agencies . The contact with the law was frequent and varied . The Baylor University report offered these statistics on the death-dealing drunk driver : he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic offense as a like group of nonalcoholic drivers ; 7% times as likely to have been convicted of a moving offense ; 5% times as likely to have had his license suspended ; and almost 3 times as likely to have been in an earlier collision . But it is n't just the traffic courts that get to know him well : he tends to be a familiar figure in domestic relations court , if only because he was 4 times as likely to have had disturbing marital troubles as the nonalcoholic driver . Perhaps because they sympathize with the problem-wracked defendant , juries are grudging in their willingness to penalize the killer drunk . They 've made death-by-drunk one of the most permissible crimes in America . Their reluctance is reflected in our public servants : politicians are loath to pass tougher laws against drunk driving , judges are loath to impose the toughest sentence under the law , and traffic policemen - seeing the hypocrisy of judges and politicians - become loath to bring drunk driving charges even where they are justified . ( Some startling statistics : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just two per traffic policeman each year . For every arrest made for drunk driving , some 2,000 other drunk driving violations go unheeded or unreported . ) You do n't have to be a big-wheel politician to get out of a drunk driving spot . All you have to do is know how to manipulate the law , or get a lawyer to do it for you . In many cases , the mere appearance of a lawyer will cause a prosecutor to reduce a drunk driving charge to one that is trivial . In other cases , a judge will negotiate a lesser charge , or outright freedom , for fear that a lawyer will appeal a drunk driving conviction to a higher court - and win . In still other cases , a drunk driving charge will somehow get " lost " or " misfiled , " and the drunk driver will never be called to trial , or if called and convicted - never be punished . The massive injustice this lenience works on society was reflected in a study reported in California in 1961 : of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drunk drivers were convicted of their crimes and only 5 percent - 50 of the 1,000 killer drunks - went to jail for it . There are jurists who are deeply upset by this trend . Their frustrations were reflected in the comments of Judge Sherman G. Finesilver of the Municipal Court of Denver . He cited a case in which a 75-year-old man , waiting in a crosswalk until the traffic light changed , was struck by a car and dragged 75 feet before the car stopped . The pedestrian was dead by that time , and the motorist promptly fled the scene of the accident ; he became a hit-and-run driver . But somebody had gotten his license number , and 31/2 hours later he was arrested at his home in a very drunken state . He admitted that he 'd hit the old man . He insisted that he had n't had a drink since the accident . But before the accident , he said , he 'd had three shots of whiskey , four beers , and - with two companions - had consumed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the accident indicated a blood-alcohol content of .237 percent . ( The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sets .10 percent as definite indication of drunkenness . ) But when the driver was brought to trial , he denied everything : he said he was n't drunk after all , that all he 'd had was a couple of beers . The jury measured the scientific evidence of his drunkenness . It measured the fact that he 'd fled the scene of the accident , that he 'd been a hit-and-run driver . It heard the testimony of police officers who had recorded his earlier admission of what he 'd been drinking . And then it set him free . To drink again and drive again . " This case is not isolated or unique , " said Judge Finesilver . " Similar cases are found in every community . It all reflects , " he said , " community approval of base con-duct . " The public 's easy acceptance of death dealt by a drunk driver frustrates some men , like the judge , and outrages others . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . Mr. Freestone went to his Buick . He carried a small package . " I was going to throw this away , " he said , and handed me the package . I tore off the brown wrapping paper . Inside was a book with a faded red cover .

Some ex-amples : In California , some 50,000 persons wrote to Governor Ronald Reagan asking for stronger laws against drunk driving , in response to an ad campaign by the Allstate Insurance Company . In Texas , some 12,000 persons wrote to Governor Preston Smith for the same reason . In Chicago , Judge Raymond Berg of the traffic court decided that he and the public had had enough ; he began sentencing all drivers picked up for drunk driving during the Christmas season to at least seven days in jail ? if they wanted to drink and drive , he felt , then they wanted to spend the holidays in jail . In Northbrook , Illinois , Judson B. Branch , chairman of the board at Allstate , revealed the contents of some of the letters he 'd received as a result of the anti-drunk-driving campaign his company had financed . " My father-in-law was killed by a drunk who dragged the bodya mile and a half and still did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man in Columbus , Ohio . " My young son was killed in an automobile accident caused by a person who was so drunk he could n't stand on his feet .... The subsequent court hearing was a tragic farce , and the drunk who caused the accident was let off scot free ' because he had children to support , ' " wrote a mother in Silver Spring , Maryland . " We had a head-on collision with a drunk driver whose wife had reported to the police that he had been drunk for three days and please pick him up before he hurt himself or someone else , " wrote a woman doctor near Los Angeles . " Their reply was that they could not pick him up until he had done something besides getting drunk . And so he did ! " What he did was get into a violent crash with the woman doctor 's car , a crash in which she and her husband , also a doctor , were critically injured . The drunk driver was also brought to a hospital , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't escape , go out and drive again and perhaps drink again . " How much better , " wrote the . oman , " it would have been to set someone to guard him before he got into his car . Something is certainly wrong with the laws that affect drunk drivers .... " How best can we change the laws to attack the problems ofdrunk driving ? Many methods have been proposed . Let us examine a few . At Lackland Air Force Base in Texas , the top officers applied a psychological control that had drunk drivers governing themselves . The base administrators were concerned about the high accident rate caused by off-duty personnel . They investigated and found that drunk driving was the root of most of the serious accidents . They investigated further and found that the heavy drinkers had a consistent record of previous military offenses and numerous social problems . So they simply spread the word that drunk driving was " sick " behavior that could have dire consequences , including a discharge under otherthan-honorable circumstances . That meant the stigma of " sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver all his life ; most of them did not relish applying for job after job among employers who quickly found that the applicant had been thrown out of the service as a chronic drunk . The result : drunk driving accidents at Lackland Air Force Base fell 50 percent in an astonishingly short while and even dipped well below the accident rate at other military bases . General Motors Phystester Of considerable interest to the United States Department of Transportation is the development of mechanical devices that would prevent a drunk driver from operating his motor vehicle . One of these is the Phystester developed by General Motors , which requires a series of buttons to be pushed in a certain sequence within a certain period of time in order to start the car . Persons too uncoordinated to operate the device within the time limit would find themselves with a locked ignition . Although nothing prevents a drunk driver from seeking help to operate the device , most sober citizens would think twice before assisting a drunk in this way ? particularly if there were severe penalties for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be required by law for all cars . Otherwise , the pushbutton models would be bought only by people who do n't need them ? the nondrinkers . And they would not be bought by those who do need them ? the drunk drivers . Such a device would have at least a deterrent effect upon the drinking driver . If he knew in advance that he was n't likely to get his car started to go home after his drinking bout , he might well opt for sure transportation before overindulging . Make Alcoholism a Reportable Disease An important aspect in our growing awareness of the nature and inner compulsions of the drunken driver is that it allows us to develop a dramatic new program for reducing his death toll : screening him out and eliminating him from the highway before the accident . The screening process can be done indirectly and impersonally , by sifting through traffic offense records for the multiple offender , by scanning police records and domestic court records and medical records . Indeed , it might be made mandatory that cases of alcoholism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This step is hardly unprecedented : typhoid , diphtheria , tuberculosis and many other diseases must , under the law , be reported to authorities as a way of guarding the public health . Since alcoholism is a disease and drunk driving is a grave menace to the well-being of the people ? it kills far more Americans than typhoid and diphtheria ? a logical extension of public health law is to have cases of alcoholism on file with public authorities . After an alcoholic case is reported , investigated , and reviewed by an impartial board of persons competent to determine the extent of the problem , the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles should have the power to limit that person 's right to drive until he has been cured of his disease . Breath Tests Are Accurate The Breathalyzer is a sound scientific system for determining the blood-alcohol content of any individual . There is no doubt about its findings . Above a certain level , drunkenness is no longer a matter of opinion ; it is a matter of fact . When the driver is found to bedrunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , before he commits a violation or gets into an accident . If you as an occasional drinker have any fears that this system might suddenly push you over into the criminal class , you may be reassured to know that there are excellent training programs available to teach police officers the use of breath-testing equipment . Dr. Robert B. Forney , who heads such a program for the state of Indiana , emphasizes that no citizen need ever feel that a mistake could be made via his taking the Breathalyzer test . There is no way , he insists , that through some error an innocent subject might be victimized by the machine . The Breathalyzer just can not register a blood level of alcohol higher than the true level of the testee . If there is any margin for error at all , it is always lower and hence in favor of the drinker . There is no way to beat the machine either . For many years it has been known that rinsing the mouth with a slug of liquor will leave a trace of alcohol which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood . Consequently , operators of the machine routinely keep a subject under surveillance for at least 20 minutes before administering the test in order to prevent the driver from denying charges of intoxication on the grounds that he had only had a quick drink prior to arrest . Test Before the Arrest To make a Breathalyzer screening system effective , the tests must be permitted before an arrest is made . This is common in England and in Scandinavia , where drivers must submit to tests , at the roadside or in the police station , on police demand . Upon the suggestion of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety , the city of Baton Rouge , Louisiana , enacted an experimental ordinance which permits an officer to administer a breath test prior to arrest if a driver is involved in a collision , commits a moving violation , or is suspected of a drunk driving offense . If the driver consents , a specially designed mobile van , equipped with a breath-testing device and trained technician , is immediately summoned . If the test shows a blood-alcohol level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under arrest and taken to the station house where a second breath test is administered on another machine to confirm the one done in the mobile unit . If he refuses to take the first test , however , he is subject to a fine of up to $200 and/or a jail sentence of up to 60 days . Arrests for drunken driving have risen dramatically in Baton Rouge now that police officers can be sure of making an arrest that will stick . At this writing , the breath test may be given in all but three states ( New York , North Dakota , and Minnesota ) only after a driver is arrested . Pre-arrest testing is of obvious value to the police , for , by giving them the means of determining that a drunk-driving offense has actually been committed , they then have adequate justification for making an arrest . ( How absurd to expect a police officer to decide just by looking at a driver that he has more than .10 percent or .15 percent alcohol in him and then to force him to arrest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wonder that so few arrests are made . ) It benefits drivers by immediately exonerating the legally sober driver at the scene , without his being subjected to the embarrassment and inconvenience of arrest . Although pre-arrest testing raises questions of constitutional rights , it has not as yet been successfully challenged in the courts . Without a doubt , we must press hard for it in every state . The Legal Limit A realistic view of what blood-alcohol level constitutes drunkenness must be adopted . The amount is customarily expressed in terms of percentages : .10 percent means one tenth of one percent of alcohol in the blood , by weight ? milligrams of alcohol per milligram of blood . A study by Dr. Robert F. Borkenstein ? inventor of the Breathalyzer ? showed that drivers with levels of .04 percent were not much more likely to cause accidents than nondrinkers . At .10 percent , they were 6 times as likely to cause accidents , and at .15 percent , 25 times as likely to cause accidents as nondrinkers . The lower legal level can be set anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .05 percent the driver is levied a large fine ( set according to his annual income ) ; at .15 percent he is immediately sent to prison . In our country , Utah sets the lower limit at .08 percent ; below that and the driver is judged " sober . " Some 21 states set a lower limit of .15 percent , and 25 states set a limit of .10 percent . ( Three states do n't even have a limit . ) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , as we have seen , recommends .10 percent as the lower limit used in defining drunkenness . What does this mean ? 1 t means that a person who weighs 150 pounds would have to consume five ounces of 80-proof liquor within an hour to reach a blood-alcohol level of .10 percent . That 's five highballs in an hour on an empty stomach . After a meal , the 1.50-pound person would have to drink seven such highballs in an hour to reach the .10 percent blood-alcohol level . It would not seem a hardship , ' to anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that before driving . The fact is that many scientific studies have shown that 99 percent of the drivers known to be drinking have less than .10 percent alcohol in their blood , That means the occasional or " social " drinker would not be implicated by a standard of .10 . On the other hand , the other one percent are not only above .10 percent but far above it . More than half of them are above .20 percent . Which means that those arrested and tested for drunk driving are not just social or casual drinkers ; they are determined drunks who 've been taking on a great deal of alcohol before going out to test their skills on the highway . The next question is the old question : Once you 've screened out the drunk drivers , what do you do ? In the past , the custom has been ( a ) to set them free to kill again , ( b ) to suspend or revoke their drivers ' licenses , ( c ) to levy fines against them , and ? rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of these alternatives has worked : the rising toll of continued from page 149 drunk driving accidents is its own testimony to failure . The reason : alcoholics are not persuaded to stop drinking by these methods ; the only method of removing them from the highways ? among these three ? is by jailing them . And as soon as they get out of jail they go right back to drinking ? and to driving while drunk . Suspending License Not Solution Unfortunately the current practice of suspending drivers ' licenses is not keeping drunken drivers off the road . In North Carolina , the Charlotte News reported that 15 percent of all drunk drivers whose licenses had been suspended were arrested again within six months while driving without a license . In St. Louis , a driver whose car went through a red light and killed the driver of another car was found to have a record of 70 previous traffic arrests . He 'd been convicted three times for drunken driving and once for manslaughter for his part in a crash in which his own son was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident , his license was under suspension ; he was using an apparently fraudulent receipt for a chauffeur 's license to flash at police in case he was picked up again for anything less than causing another death . Impound the Automobile ? Is the next , most logical step to impound cars of drunks caught driving with dangerously high blood-alcohol levels and no drivers ' licenses ? Would this not be better than jail ? Game wardens routinely impound the fishing tackle and firearms of persons found hunting or fishing out of season . And the federal government impounds , on the spot , cars in which illegal narcotics are found hidden . Later it institutes legal proceedings against the automobile to acquire ownership . Federal narcotics agents then use the car as an unmarked vehicle for further forays , or the government sells it at auction to help finance its drug investigations . if the same routine could be applied against drunken drivers , the state or federal government would be permitted to bring suit against the automobile , not the driver , and then confiscate it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at apprehending drunken drivers , or conducting research into further ways of classifying them . Those who operate drunk-driver training programs on inadequate budgets think wistfully of this system by which drug officers can make offenders pay for the costs of apprehending themselves . With the advent of the Phystester , their dreams may come to reality . Because this appliance might be considered part of the automobile , it is within the realm of possibility that a car , being driven by a drunk and without its Phystester operating legally , could be impounded , sued , and taken from its drinking owner . Many accidents occur when careless relatives loan cars to their known-to-be-drinking kin . This dangerous practice might stop if cars could be legally impounded . To make tampering with a Phystester grounds for legal action against the automobile may be the opening wedge for getting legislation against drunk-killer automobiles on a par with the narcotic-smuggling automobiles . Considering that drunk driving is at least as serious a problem as narcotics addiction ? indeed , its fatalities are numbered in the tens of thousands , not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system be established for drunk driving . Right now the innocent driver pays for the cost of arresting the drunk : in taxes and in rising insurance rates which are influenced by the statistics arising from drunken accidents . The means of raising money to apprehend offenders should be linked to their own misdemeanors . Large budgets are necessary to train officers in the use of the Breathalyzer ? but accurate use of the Breathalyzer is assurance for all of us that everyone can have a fair test on the highway . Are there any other ways ? In any system , the basic thrust is not to punish the drunk driver , but ( a ) to protect the public , and ( b ) to force the drunk to choose between drinking and driving , while motivating him to overcome his illness . The only other alternative is to do nothing ? to sit back and watch the drunk driving toll mount higher and higher , perhaps double in the next 12 years , just as it has doubled in the last 16 years . But this is insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bubonic plague engulf the land . The measures demanded today are stern but fair . They are within the centuries-old tradition of public health ? of protecting the public from the devastation of disease at the harshest of costs . We are fortunate to live in that pivotal moment of time when our new awareness of what the drunk driver is offers a chance to screen him out , to get him from behind the wheel of his car , to motivate him to clean himself up . In examining the poll on this page , you must remember : it is not only society in the mass that is endangered by a lingering inaction . It is also the individuals in society ? the innocent persons who every day climb into a car and , like the nine members of the Hoffmeister family , unknowingly embark on a drive toward death .
