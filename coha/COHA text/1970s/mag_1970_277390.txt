At a majestic white-tie ceremony in Stockholm 's Concert Hall , seven of 1970 's Nobel prizewinners gathered last week to receive their awards from King Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden . The eighth laureate , Russian Novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn , was present in spirit only . Fearful that he would not be allowed to return to Russia , Solzhenitsyn sent a letter to the Swedish Academy expressing the hope that his " involuntary absence " would not " darken " the ceremony . The Swedish Academy spokesman reportedly failed to read one sentence of Solzhenitsyn 's message at the banquet : " May the people at this rich table not forget the political prisoners now on hunger strikes in protest against the total destruction of their rights . " <P> In Moscow , friends of Solzhenitsyn said he celebrated his Nobel award , and his 52nd birthday , by attending a meeting of the unofficial " Committee for Human Rights " recently founded by the celebrated Soviet Physicist Andrei Sakharov to defend personal freedoms in the Soviet Union .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
