Many educators would agree with Coleman that school perpetuates adolescence by shielding the student from real work experience . But how does a youngster acquire experience when there are not that many paying jobs available to him ? <P> For the past three years the government of Canada has funded an innovative program called Opportunities for Youth , which pays students to dream up and work at jobs they want to do-such as bike patrols for cyclists in distress or day camps for children of low-income families . <P> In the U.S. , youngsters have no say in the definition of jobs provided through federal programs , most of which are aimed at poor and minority youths . Traditionally , middle-class students have been left to their own devices , and this summer 's job search has proved a hard test of their ingenuity . <P> Officially , the nation 's job situation is not all that bad . The seasonal rate of unemployment for youngsters between the ages of 16 and 19 is now 14.8% , compared with 16% a year ago ; but the statistics do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for students seeking summer work . <P> Terry Kintop , a counselor for the Minnesota Department of Manpower Services , says that summer jobs for middle-class youths have been " nearly nil " in his area .

" Many have been doing just that-all summer long . <P> It took Natherlene Bolden , a Bronx Community College scholarship student , almost four months to find a temporary job answering a telephone in a carpet showroom for $2 an hour . <P> " When I first started tin April , the New York State Employment Office told me it was too soon , " she says , " but when I went back in May , they told me that all the summer jobs had been taken . " <P> She answered a Sunday newspaper ad for college students placed by a chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday there were no further openings . She went to an employment agency that offered a $95-a-week switchboard job ( for which she would have had to pay a $133 finder 's fee ) , but that job never opened up . " I went to Morrisania Hospital because I heard they were hiring , but they told me there was nobody to interview me and they would contact me , " she says . " I went back two weeks later , but nothing was available . " Next she went to United Parcel " because I was told there were jobs . At least they let me fill out an application , " she says . " Then they told me to keep calling-every other week . " <P> Ruth Geyer is a biology major at Oberlin , but three days a week ( for $3 an hour ) she dons an apron to wax furniture , wash windows and mop the floors of a ten-room house in the wealthy Philadelphia suburb of Rosemont , Pa .
