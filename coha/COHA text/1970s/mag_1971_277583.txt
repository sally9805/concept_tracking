IN J.M.G. Le Clzio 's novel The Flood , I the anti-hero is a young man suffering from a unique malady . Words-the deluge of daily words-have overloaded his circuits . Even when he is strolling down the street , minding his own business , his poor brain jerks under the impact of instructions ( WALK-DO N'T WALK ) , threats ( TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED ) , and newsstand alarms ( PLANE CRASH AT TEL AVIV ) . Finally , Le Clzio 's Everyman goes numb-nature 's last defense . Spoken words become mere sounds , a meaningless buzz in the ears . The most urgent printed words-a poem by Baudelaire , a proclamation of war-have no more profound effect than the advice he reads ( without really reading ) on a book of matches : PLEASE CLOSE COVER BEFORE STRIKING . <P> If one must give a name to Le Clzio 's disease , perhaps semantic aphasia will do . Semantic aphasia is that numbness of ear , mind and heart-that tone deafness to the very meaning of language-which results from the habitual and prolonged abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be amusing if not downright irritating . But when it becomes epidemic , it signals a disastrous decline in the skills of communication , to that mumbling low point where language does almost the opposite of what it was created for . With frightening perversity-the evidence mounts daily-words now seem to cut off and isolate , to cause more misunderstandings than they prevent . <P> Semantic aphasia is the monstrous insensitivity that allows generals to call war " pacification , " union leaders to describe strikes or slowdowns as " job actions , " and politicians to applaud even moderately progressive programs as " revolutions . " Semantic aphasia is also the near-pathological blitheness that permits three different advertisers in the same women 's magazine to call a wig and two dress lines " liberated . " <P> <P> So far , so familiar . Whenever the ravishing of the English language comes up for perfunctory headshaking , politicians , journalists , and ad writers almost invariably get cast as Three Horsemen of the Apocalypse . The perennially identified culprits are guilty as charged , God knows . At their worst-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world through a bad PA system . Does it matter what they actually say ? They capture your attention , right ? They are word manipulators-the carnival barkers of life who misuse language to pitch and con and make the quick kill . <P> So let 's hear all the old boos , all the dirty sneers . Paste a sticker proclaiming STAMP OUT AGNEWSPEAK On every bumper . Take the ribbons out of the typewriters of all reporters and rewritemen . Force six packs a day on the guy who wrote " Winston tastes good like . . . " Would that the cure for semantic aphasia were that simple .
