txt " A vast Improvement . " That 's how one top U.S. airline official describes the new anti-hijack " Checkpoint Charlie " procedures at 531 major airports which become official Jan. 15 . The official warns , however , that the new system ' ' probably wo n't stop air piracy altogether ? obviously you ca n't have a law enforcement officer at every corner , and the sky marshal program ( armed guards riding on scheduled flights ) has n't stopped skyjacking . " Under the newly official rules of the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) all hand luggage must be checked , and all passengers must-be'screened by metal-detecting devices . As of Feb. 6 , airports must provide armed security guards at all departure areas . The airline industry estimates total cost is likely to exceed $200 million a year . Some airports will search all visitors going beyond checkpoints with passengers ; others are experimenting with sealing off the narrow concourses that lead from ticket counters to departure gates . To find the money , the industry is asking the Civil Aeronautics Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a request for an early decision , but air fares may go up early in February . The newly official regulations were announced Dec. 5 . Most passengers good-humored Air passengers have been displaying considerable goodwill in putting up with the delays and inconveniences of rules already in effect . Meanwhile , test-run searches at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago , the world 's busiest airport , have uncovered a wild array of weapons carried by the traveling public ? from knives to switchblades to mace to loaded guns . O'Hare Airport has experimented with two search procedures on domestic flights since before Christmas , drawing upon experience from security checks at its international terminal dating back to September , 1971. // *Airlines hopeful on checks // One of the search methods has been dubbed " concourse sterilization . " American , Alleghent , Delta , and North Central airlines that share the same terminal area in Chicage have pooled their resources to have all passengers and visitors screened as they enter one of the concourse " fingers . " Since each concourse serves more than a dozen boarding gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct the checks . At most airports , however , because it is not feasible to block off an entire concourse , the airlines are conducting searches at the boarding areas . Friends an extra problem The " good-by factor " weighs heavily in the decision whether to use date security checks or the " sterilized concourse , " say spokemen for United Air Lines . Friends and relatives seeing passengers off must be searched as well , if screening is done prior to the boarding gate , United points out U.S. Deputy Marshals , U.S. Custom officials , and , after Feb. 6 , local police will be standing by at checkpoints in case the magnetometers and luggage searches reveal illegal weapons " The number of arrests and confiscations has risen sharply in the last two weeks since the new security checks went into effect . " reports Walter E. Hanaman , supervisor of the U.S. deputy marshals at O'Hare . The number of instances of knives or guns being detected has risen to three or four a day , he says . Arrests made promptly Some sharp objects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cabin , and returned to the passenger after the plane has landed . Such was the case of a Chicago holiday traveler who was carrying a giftwrapped cake knife , complete with pearl handle and a six-inch serrated blade . But persons found carrying switchblades , guns , and other illegal weapons have been arrested on the spot by law-enforcement officers . In one case , in Columbus , Ohio , recently , airline , officials report , screening procedures spotted a suspicious character who , upon further searching , was charged with having just robbed a bank and fleeing the state . The FAA has provided the airlines with $3 5 million in magnetometers to conduct the checks of passengers on all flights . These machines , sensitive enough to register metal - items as small as ak ey , enabletheairline sto mechanically " frisk " people without much delay in boarding an aircraft . However , searching carry-on luggage ? briefcases , purses , and packages ? has led to considerable slowdowns , at least in the initial days . This has prompted some airline officials to wish out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stowed in the cargo hold , rather than insisting that it be carried on board . Such a step could cut down on delays and expense , they say .
