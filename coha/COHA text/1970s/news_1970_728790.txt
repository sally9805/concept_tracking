txt Letters to the Editor of The Times Letters to the Editor of The Times Japan 's Policies for Industrialization To the Editor : I read with great interest the July 29 grim news account of Japan 's " pollution crisis . " The news article suggested that the Japanese Government has followed policies over the last ten years that have tended to favor enormous industrial expansion with little consideration for its effect on the environment . The article also suggested total expenditures in Japan for antipollution purposes in 1970 would amount to only $126 million . A three-paragraph story on page 56 on the same day reported that the American steel industry alone placed a ? record $138 million worth of new air and water purification equipment into operation in 1969 . Other newspapers reported that the industry spent $101.6 million in 1968 and $838.6 million for such facilities between 1951 and 1969 . Currently authorized expenditures amount to $385 million . The last week in July major steel companies in the United States reported substantial profit declines from . 1969 ; in some cases more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the problem . Foreign Competition Many American industries , notably shoes , textiles and steel , are having serious problems because of ? exports of those products from foreign countries , particularly Japan , to the United Stes . Critics of proposed trade legislation , such as The Times , opposed quotas or other import limitations on the grounds that lower prices of foreign imports benefit business and the consumer by stimulating competition , keeping domestic prices down , and holding back inflation . The fact is that industry in the United States has to make increasingly heavy investments in pollution control equipment , while countries like Japan assist their industries in drastically expanding production with little attention to environmental quality . This adds appreciably to the competitive disadvantage of the United States vis- ? - vis foreign producers . This is surely not the kind of competition we should be stimulating . The relative inattention to pollution control by Japan and other countries presents another type of problem for the U.S. All mankind is living on " spaceship , Earth " with its limited resources . It Is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in some fashion . Man 's future , therefore , depends on close coordination and equalization of pollution ' control efforts among industrial nations . EDMUND F. MARTIN Bethlehem , Pa. , Aug. 3 , 1970 The writer is chairman of Bethlehem Steel Corporation . ? City . Pension Funds To the Editor : Herbert M. Benon 's Aug. 3 letter concerning the pension funds of . New York City contained a number of statements which require correction . First , Mr. Benon points out in some detail that with brokerage commissions of $1.25 a bond on sales and $2.50 a bond on purchases , the total commission cost to the New York City pension funds would amount to $10,612,500 . However , Mr. Benon does not fully appreciate that the largest and ' most liquid market for bonds is the over-the-counter market . Here all large transactions ( $100,000 or over ) are made on a net basis in a negotiated market . That is , no commission is charged , but the broker makes his profits on the difference between what he pays for a security and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city is con- ' cerned , each of these transactions is carefully scrutinized by the Controller 's research and trading staff , as well as by his bond investment adviser ? a large and competent commercial bank . The markets are checked to be sure the best possible price is obtained on the " sell " side as well as on the . " buy " side . Further , no switch is made unless it conforms with recent state legislation which requires the funding of the loss on an actuarial basis while increasing the over-all income of the pension funds . Under state legislation approved earlier this year , the State Controller is making similar exchanges of bonds to improve the over-all earnings of the state pension funds . Second , Mr. Benon states that when $3 billion of low-yield bonds are sold , the markets will be depressed , anti when a similar amount of high yield bonds are bought , prices will be driven up . Surely he ca n't believe that the Controller , his staff , or his investment adviser would act in such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done with the greatest care , over a period of years , and only when market conditions are favorable . Furthermore , since the funds ' sales and purchases will offset each other , the net effect on the market will be approximately in balance . Third , Mr. Benon quotes the Controller as saying that " these maneuvers will produce a profit of $9.5 million . " What the Controller did state , based upon an analysis by his investment adviser , is that the switching program would result in increased income to the funds of about $9.5 million in the first year alone . JULIAN G. BUCKLEY Third Deputy Controller City of New York New York , Aug. 5 , 1970 ? A Better Society To the Editor : In his July 7 column Tom Wicker hypothesizes that a citizen should have a legal right to keep derogatory information about himself out of public personnel records which automatic data-processing technology has made increasingly accessible and efficient . There is a deficiency in due process ; but the deficiency is substantive , not procedural . As Mr. Wicker points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities and expose one to further harassment by ? the police and the criminal courts . In a better society , a previous criminal record or the suspicion of one would not - disqualify one from seeking further education , would not disqualify one from obtaining suitable employment and licensing . Ina better society the . police would not be permitted. , to make arrests on suspicion , and the criminal courts would be shorn of power to impose destructive sentences of death ? or long or arbitrary confinement . In a better society we would be more iealistic about the foibles of human nature , more tolerant and less punitive . Regulation of automatic dataprocessing technology in fields such as personnel administration or the administration of criminal justice will be futile unless we acquire greater humanity and wisdom in the use of the knowledge which is be , ing forced upon us . GEORGE N. PRIWCE Seattle , July 23 , 1%70 : ? Add Small Blessings To the Editor : How refreshing to read Jane Henderson 's Aug. 3 letter of small blessings in the midst of frustrations . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man from his cab ; I saw a policeman smile benignly at two " hippies " walking and kissing in Central Park ; I read of Captain Watkins and Premier Castro 's civilized behavior on the occasion of the recent 747 hijacking ; I saw three lanes of traffic stop with : - out complaint because of a dog loose on the East River Drive . I , too , have some optimism about my fellow humans . PAUL METZGER , M.D. New York , Aug. 3 , 1970
