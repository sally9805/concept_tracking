" It 's William McKinley 's revenge , " muttered one Buffalo resident as he squinted through the slits of his frosted face-mask at the snow-encrusted monument to the President who was assassinated in the city in 1901 . That explanation made as much sense as any . The 435,000 inhabitants of what local CBers call Nickel City could not help wondering why they and their rural neighbors had been selected for the vengeful Winter of ' 77 's most punishing assault so far . In fact , Buffalo 's location on a narrow peninsula , where it catches moisture-laden winds off Lake Erie , contributes to its singular attraction for snow . Since fall , Buffalo has been smothered by an incredible 14 feet of snowfall . Last week drifts as high as 30 feet buried the roads in the area , paralyzing all business and movement . Winds up to 85 m.p.h. generated a numbing chill factor of - 60 , and 22 people died in the cold . <P> The worst blizzard in the city 's history had howled with little warning across Lake Erie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles were abandoned by their owners when all traffic stopped ; police in the suburban town of Lancaster counted 66 cars in just one two-mile stretch of roadway , some with the snow piled over their roofs . Drivers sought shelter wherever they could find it . Some 400 motorists and stranded downtown workers slept on chairs and the floors of the Liberty Bank Building . <P> Heroic Firemen . The Statler Hilton Hotel passed out sheets and towels and crammed four people into some rooms . " Even the lobby was wall-to-wall people , " said one employee . The 500 patients at the Edward J. Meyer Memorial Hospital crowded a little closer so that some 2,000 unexpected visitors could find places to sleep . Near the city zoo , residents saw a strange sight befitting the arctic scene : reindeer roaming in their backyards . The herd had escaped from the zoo by simply walking across a snow-packed moat . <P> The storm fostered a new spirit of camaraderie in the city . Bars were jammed with customers who could not get home . At the Rail Bar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new group of ten entered ; he feared the floor would cave in under the crowd 's weight . At Salvatore 's Italian Gardens Restaurant in Lancaster , free sandwiches for everyone replaced costly Chateaubriand . Fire departments set up soup and spaghetti lines . The Salvation Army served meals to 25,000 people , clothed 4,000 , gave medical supplies to 3,000 . Citizens offered their snowmobiles for emergency rescue missions . Residents without electricity or gas found others willing to take them into their homes .
