txt Every year the United States Government spends $4 million to $4.5 million telling its citizens that cigarette smoking is " dangerous to your health . " It is so concerned about the health effects on American smokers that it wo n't let cigarettemakers advertise on radio or TV . But every year this same government spends another $68 million-15 times asmuch  --  encouraging farmers to grow tobacco , and processors to sell it abroad . Somehow the health of non-Americans conveniently gets forgotten in the industrial rush to make money . Sen. Frank E. Moss ( D ) of Utah finds such wastefulness and immorality " utterly shocking . " He calls it government schizophrenia . But the Senate 's foremost antismoking leader acknowledges in an interview that at the moment he is ' practically powerless to do anything about it . . // *U . S. government promotes tobacco production , sales production , // This year as last , Senator Moss introduced a bill to end these annual $68 million protobacco subsidies . But he Ca n't even get the Senate Agriculture Committee , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold one . The committee is heavy with supporters of tobacco interests , and the publicity generated by a hearing could cause public pressure to pare the protobacco subsidies . Senator Moss 's colleagues on Capitol Hill are n't stirred up about the problem ? it will take public pressure to do that . And the public either does n't care or does n't know ? thanks to the absence of committee hearings . Thus , like many another member of Congress in this position , Senator Moss is trying to find some way to circumvent a hostile committee . He says candidly that " my problem is trying to puzzle out some way to get jurisdiction of such a bill into another committee . . . . " Maybe by using the health angle as the prominent focus of the bill , you could get it sent to the Labor and Public Welfare Committee , where you would get a sympathetic hearing . Then if the hearing generated enough publicity , public reaction eventually might force Congress to end these subsidies . " Possibility considered As one possibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill to end federal subsidies for all products that pro-due harmful effects on users  --  including cigarettes . Senator Moss 's latest figures are for fiscal 1970  --  the year from July 1 , 1969 , through June 30 , 1970 . He says during that year the United States spent $68,710,000 of its , taxpayers ' money subsidizing various aspects of the tobacco industry  --  a figure that has n't changed much in five years . He breaks it down as follows : ? $28 million in export subsidy . To compete with cheaper foreign tobacco goods , exporters must sell American tobacco products at lower-than-domestic prices ; Uncle Sam  --  and the taxpayer  --  make up the difference to them . ? $210,000 to advertise U.S. tobacco products abroad . ? $4,9 million to subsidize American farmers who grow tobacco : The subsidies guarantee them a minimum price for their crop . ? $42 million to inspect and grade the year 's tobacco crop , and publish statistics about it . Senator Moss says only the tobacco crop gets free inspection , paid for by American taxpayers . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost must be borne by buyers and sellers . ? $31.2 million as the value of tobacco sent abroad under the Food for Peace program . Senator Moss is particularly incensed by the idea of exporting tobacco under the Food for Peace program . " The basic idea " of the program , he points out , " was to get food into countries that were in need of food . , .. One of the things they need least in areas where food is a problem " is tobacco , Senator Moss says one reason American farmers who grow tobacco keep planting it is that it is extremely profitable . He says that in 1970 tobacco was planted on only three-tenths of 1 percent of all croplands  --  but the tobacco crop totaled 7.5 percent of cash receipts for all crops , Aid for crop switching The Senator says that land on which tobacco is grown is " good farmland . . . many other crops can be grown there . " His bill would provide tobacco farmers with loans at little or no interest to switch to other crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , So the Senator plots his strategy  --  circumvent a hostile committee , and try to get the public and the Congress exercised about the twin issues of waste and immorality in the $68 million subsidies . A year ago they were very concerned about the effects of cigarette smoking on Americans ' health . As a result , under the Senate 's leadership Congress banned cigarette advertisements , from radio and TV . Senator Moss would like to see some of this same concern for the health of non-American smokers . 0
