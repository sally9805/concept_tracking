txt MOSCOW  --  United States Ambassador Malcom Toon calls it a career Tuesday after completing a 2-year-and-10-month tour as America 's top diplomat here . With 40 years of government service behind him , the 63-year-old Toon is what diplomats describe as " an old Soviet hand . " Ile served two earlier assignments at the American embassy here , and he bas worked on the State Department 's Soviet desk in Washington . Toon has also been ambassador to Israel and Yugoslavia . ' Tribune Correspondent Jim Gallagher recently talked with Toon about the state of Soviet-American relations . The interview took place in Toon 's private office in the embassy . Here are some excerpts . Q ? There Is increased concern that Soviet-American relations are steadily worsening . From your point of view , is the concern Justified ? A ? I think they are worse off now than they were before we were seized with the Cuban-Soviet brigade flap . But I think a lot depends upon whether the SALT II Treaty is signed . If the treaty is rejected , I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a &A.; Q ? Why do you , Support Senate ap ? proval of the SALT pact ? A ? For these basic reasons : it will add a stabilizing element in the relationship . It is a beginning , and only a beginning , to effective arms control measures , which we would anticipate being negotiated at the SALT III talks . Also , SALT II places limits on the Soviet strategic nuclear arsenal for the first time , ' as well as our own . And finally , it does not weaken ' our security in any way , or that of our allies . It 's genuinely in our national interest for the Senate to accept it . Q ? Do you think that at the same time , there 's a need to beef up American military potential , In particular , to Install medium-range missiles in Europe ? A ? Yes , primarily because there 's a clear imbalance between the Soviet and NATO tactical nuclear forces on the continent . I think that imbalance ought to be repaired as soon as possible . Q ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ? There has been a substantial buildup of the Soviet military machine over the last 10 years . And I frankly see no need for this sort of thing . For example , their arsenal in Central Europe is way beyond any possible defense , requirements . I think the buildup of the Soviet strategic nuclear arsenal is also subject to the same criticism . I do n't think they 're going for strike force capability . But I do n't really understand why they feel they have to have such -a powerful is Continued on peg-. 5 , col. 2 Old Soviet hand , ' Toon , backs SALT // military machine . Q ? Where do you believe our vital interests lie ? A ? This is not an easy thing to pinpoint . I would say , first of all , the Western Hemisphere . Secondly , the NATO area . Thirdly , the Middle East oil supply line and Israel . Finally , Japan . Beyond that , we have to be a little careful about extending our involvement . Q ? Are you saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence and military involvement from spreading in Africa . for example ? can do n't think there 's very much we can do , We have taken the position that African problems should be-resolved bythe Africans themselves , without superpower involvement . I thilik , ; that is a very solid and sound , position . . This means we have to encourage the Africans to adopt this posture , and ultimately perhaps , they will bring about the withdrawal of Soviet forces . Q ? You hear talk pt restricting the sale of American grain to the Soviets to Influence their actions . Do you think this is feasible ? A ? I think frankly there is a political problem . This year , for example , we have a bumper crop ; Our farmers want to sell their goods . We have a balance of payments problem . I think for these reasons , plus the humanitarian one , we have to go ahead with grain sales . There is no practical possibility of using grain sales as leverage . Q ? Can we be a little tougher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years ? - A ? I would hope so . I 'm a firm believer in being very tough with the Soviets . Not in a way which would alarm their suspicions , but in a way which would let thorn understand that we are going to do what is necessary in order to protect our vital interests . I think we could have made clear at the time of the Angolan intervention that we regarded the use of Cuban proxy forces as a ? real threat to world stability . That might possibly have deterred the Soviets from going down that path . I think the fact that they are training Cuban forces for . that role is a very dangerous posture , and we ought to let them know it 's the sort of thing we wo n't *tolerate . Q ? What should our policy vis-a-vis ' China be in the coming years ? A ? I think we ought to be careful about tilting too far in the direction of Peking . We ought to be aware of the concerns of the Soviet Union with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to he on guard against as we define our relationship with China ? A ? We must always bear in mind that the Soviets have an almost paranoid concern about China . They do n't regard China at the present time as a viable military threat . But they look far down the road to when China will have modQ . &; A. ernized its economy , . built up its antitary machine to the , point where it can be considered a military threat . That 's the day they anticipate with a good deal of concern , even fear . Therefore , I think , while going ahead with normalization of our relations with China  --  and I think this is clearly ' in our national interest ? we ought to be completely evenhanded and not do or- say anything which would arouse Soviet suspicions as to what we 're ? really up to . , Q ? Can gp build up China economically and militarily without seriously straining oar - relatione with the Soviet Union ? A ? We ought to give the Chinese such help as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and investment , while at the same time avoiding the transfer of high technology items , which we deny the Soviets . I do n't think that it 's necessarily in our interest to build up the Chinese military machine . But if they feel that they need , certain equip-meat for essential defense purposes , then we should , do nothing to block sales , for example , from our ' Western European allies . We ourselves should - not indulge in the sale of arms to any communist country . Q ? In the long run , which is more Important to American interest  --  China or the Soviet Union ? A ? I 'm not sure I would look at the problem- in those terms . I think it is important to us that the two powers avoid the development of a situation which might result in hostilities . It Is important to maintain peace in both the Asian and European parts of the world , I do n't think we ought to play one against the other . Q ? Do you see any possibility of us getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - We ought to be Very careful that we do n't , This dispute has its own  --  momentum end will so on and develop its . own course of action without any influence from us . And I think we ought to just stay out of it
