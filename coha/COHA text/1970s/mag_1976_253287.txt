MONTY PYTHON LIVE ! <P> <P> The human body is one of comedy 's supple tools . In agility , it releases tonic exuberance . As an object of humiliation through banana-peel pratfalls or pies in the face , it evokes instant delight . Even distortions or grotesqueries of the body-obesity , dwarfishness , eccentric gaits , tics , stutters , deafness and drunken staggers-have all been known to provoke a startling comic catharsis in playgoers . <P> The silent film thrived on that catharsis . So did vaudeville , and that Broadway combustion engine of explosive anarchy known as Hellzapoppin . Britain 's Monty Python troupe , which opened live at Manhattan 's City Center last week , renews that comic tradition , and its success in television , movies and now , onstage , shows that many audiences are parched for it . If there is anything novel about the Pythonites ( six men , with extras for this production ) , it is only that they are practicing comic karate , English-style , and Americans always find it strangely exotic to think of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both straight and kinky , all of which they can be and are . <P> In Monty Python Live ! the operative word is " live , " for almost all of the routines have been seen before on American TV . Fortunately , they are unkillably hilarious even in repetition . Since the performers understandably need to catch their breath , film clips share equal billing with the live players ' stage antics . When John Cleese delivers a diatribe to a shyster pet-shop owner while flogging the dead parrot that has been sold to him , the funning is lethally potent . So is the spoof on TV wrestling , in which the solo performer , Graham Chapman , is finger-jabbed and pretzel-twisted by an invisible opponent . <P> Philosophers as soccer kings get mauled in a ludicrous film match between the prize thinkers of Greece and Germany , in which the Greeks win by a head-thumping , last-minute goal from the great dome of Aristotle . After a trying day in court , two justices ( Eric Idle and Neil Innes ) flip their wigs and throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black silky feminine underthings . Apparently , a case of habeas corpus . <P> No matter how high the brow or how low , Monty Python Live ! creases it with jet-propelled mirth .
