HISTORY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR by B.H. Liddell Hart . 768 pages . Putnam. $12.50 . <P> The scene insinuates itself early in the reader 's mind . The place is London , one of those comfortable , leathered clubs with high-back wing chairs and good port . Across the table , C. Aubrey Smith , his mustache drooping imperially , leans forward in his scarlet mess dress tunic to rearrange the saltcellars , silverware and apples on the table before him . There are proud mutterings of hussars , lancers , and Royal Scots Greys , tones of awe for the Panzergrenadiers . " There they were , " he announces with grave mien . " And over here , a thin red line . " <P> Despite the Four Feathers mood that clings to it , Sir Basil Liddell Hart 's last work is magisterial . On active duty in World War I , he rose only to the rank of captain in the British army before being gassed in 1916 ; yet , as his country 's foremost military historian , he became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast-moving armored columns , a teacher of generals . Liddell Hart worked on this history for a quarter-century ; he died last year while correcting proofs . Quite literally , it is his epitaph , and an appropriate one . For along with a crisp style , skill and precision , it carries the anachronistic imprint of a boy who grew up loving games and came to view war as the most fascinating game of all . <P> As the story begins , we meet again those bungling French and British statesmen , the chaps who need not have gone to war at all , at least not at such a time on such a scale . Selling out Czechoslovakia with its 35 trained and ready divisions cut the heart out of effective opposition to Hitler in Central Europe . Allied military planners , on Liddell Hart 's evidence , were little better than the politicians . He credits them with inviting Hitler 's invasion of Scandinavia with loudly proclaimed plans to mine Norwegian ports and cut off the flow of iron ore from Sweden . Sir Basil thinks somewhat more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he admits , succeeded in their dramatic 1940 breakthrough on the Western front partly by accident . Their initial plan for the invasion of France was a right-flank wheel through Belgium along the lines of the 1914 Schlieffen plan , which might easily have been met and thwarted . The strategy was dropped , however , when a German major , flying in a snowstorm , was forced down in Belgium with a full set of war plans that was seized by the Allies . The substitute plan sent General Heinz Guderian 's spectacular armored thrust through the seemingly impassable Ardennes to catch the French near Sedan , a critically weak point in their defenses.
