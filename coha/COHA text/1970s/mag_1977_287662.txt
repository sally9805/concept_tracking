It is a nasty blot on the good name of socialism in Eastern Europe : the waiting time for purchasing a private automobile is frequently longer than a five-year plan and seldom shorter than the Berlin blockade . Only those with access to foreign currency seem to be able to drive away from a showroom with a new car minutes after walking in . For humbler folk who have the cash to spend ( but precious little to buy ) , the wait can drag on for as long as seven years . Although the Polish government is trying hard to meet consumer needs , the fierce demand for wheels outstrips the supply . To beat black marketeers to the punch , Poland 's Communist leaders employ an un-Marxist solution : used-car capitalism . <P> Every Sunday beginning at 7 a.m. , a procession of cars , ranging from almost brand-new models to well-traveled klunkers , wheels up to a parking lot in the Okecie district of Warsaw . Often the line outside the 150-car lot stretches for more than a mile . But it is worth waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.33 , the drivers go into the used-car business . Most of the car owners are already government-sanctioned smalltime capitalists-garage proprietors , auto mechanics , private doctors-with a well-cultivated taste for profit . <P> Car Mart . And profit they do . All the used cars fetch higher prices than the sticker cost of a new car . Buyers in tailored overcoats roam among the aging Fiats , Opels , Czech Skodas and Polish Warszawas , checking out the odometers and the prices , which are listed on hand-lettered signs stuck behind the windshield . On a recent Sunday , for example , one man was trying to sell his 1977 Lada ( a Soviet-built Fiat ) , with 6,000 kilometers on the clock , for $11,000 ; new-when available-the car sells for $5,570 . " It 's crazy , " said one visitor to the car mart , adding , " a lot of things are like that in Poland . " <P> In addition to the Warsaw operation , the government has permitted similar gieldy samochodowe ( automobile exchanges ) in Gdansk , Wroclaw and Lodz . For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Warsaw mart , one enterprising Pole had already sold five cars for profits ranging from $150 to $1,000 . He needs the money . In the best capitalist tradition , he is working his way through college .
