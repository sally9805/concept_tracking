THEOPHILUS NORTH <P> by THORNTON WILDER <P> 374 pages . Harper &; Row . $7.95 . <P> Playwright Thornton Wilder is the good old white magician who once had us all handing chairs down theater aisles to feed a stage fire and save the suburb of Excelsior , N.J. , from the ice age . He successfully launched Noah 's ark from the Million Dollar Pier in Atlantic City-despite the fact that Mrs. Noah would n't let it shove off without Cain as well as Abel . Novelist Thornton Wilder has re-created 18th century Peru ( The Bridge of San Luis Rey ) , and ancient Rome ( The Cabala ) . In Our Town , he made Grover 's Corners , N.H. , into some sort of Eternal City of the heart . After all that , it is not much of a hop to Newport , R.I. , in the sunny summer of 1926 . <P> That is where Wilder turns up this time , in the guise of his title character , 29-year-old Theophilus North . Like Wilder , the young North ( who remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a boyhood variously spent in China , California and Wisconsin , a classics scholar , a master of many languages , an ex-prep schoolteacher and Yaleman . He is also an infernal meddler in other people 's business , more or less in the spirit ( much diminished ) of Jesus , Socrates and George Brush , Wilder 's insufferably virtuous hero in Heaven ' s My Destination . <P> Theophilus , however , has a sense of humor . He is the first to admit that his only weapons are charm , some mild Freudian therapy , a gift for mendacity and the kind of benign chicanery that in old-fashioned stories used to help gentle , truthful and kindly people at the expense of the rapacious , the pretentious and the proud . Indeed , most of the crises North confronts are genteel and domestic : incipient misalliances ( to be blocked ) , henpecked husbands ( to be liberated ) and the ill effects of ghastly rumors ( to be laid to rest ) . <P> No one should be put off by these proceedings or troubled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day , the prizewinning novel that Wilder published in 1967 , he has a character say : " It is the duty of old men to lie to the young . Let these encounter their own disillusions . We strengthen our souls , when young , on hope ; the strength we acquire enables us later to endure despair as a Roman should . " <P> In recent years Wilder , who is 76 , has been in and out of hospitals , sadly ailing . Young Theophilus North , similarly , remembers that when he came to Newport after quitting a deadly teaching job , it was like release from a hospital after a long illness . " One slowly learns to walk again , and wonderingly one raises his head . " At the start , he says , he had lost his sense of joy and play . He was " cynical and almost bereft of sympathy for any other human being . " When the book ends , with all those preposterous tangles easily , magically , straightened out , Theophilus is restored to affection for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Wilder 's Tempest , a mock world , a playful world , made safe and orderly by kindly meddling . It would take a Caliban or a young curmudgeon to complain that it is a tempest in a teapot . <P> Timothy Foote
