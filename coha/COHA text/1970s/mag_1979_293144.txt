This month will mark the unscheduled arrival of Skylab on earth , as well as the tenth anniversary of mankind 's arrival on the moon . These twin aerospace milestones are the subject of this week 's cover story , which also looks toward the uncertain but potentially dazzling future of the U.S. space program . To see further ahead , TIME commissioned Science Author and Visionary Arthur C. Clarke to supplement the story with his view of man 's long-term prospects in space . <P> TIME 'S own aeronautics expert , Washington Correspondent Jerry Hannifin , contributed voluminously to this week 's Skylab story , which was written by Senior Writer Ed Magnuson , and to Science Editor Fred Golden 's accompanying report on space exploration . A licensed pilot and irrepressible space buff , Hannifin has been covering NASA since it was NACA ( National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics , until 1958 ) . Recalls Hannifin : " We used to talk about the ' new ' turbojet engines , and , gee whiz ! a supersonic airplane even seemed possible . " Over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast-offs from Cape Kennedy and <P> Wallops Island , Va. , and interviewed a universe of scientists and astronauts . To track Skylab , Hannifin returned to several old haunts : the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , the Johnson Space Center in Houston , the Langley Research Center in Hampton , Va . But he was haunted by the sight of a souvenir displayed at the North American Air Defense Command facility near Colorado Springs : a 10-lb. container from a Soviet Soyuz that had hurtled through the atmosphere dangerously intact a few years ago , just as hundreds of Skylab chunks were expected to do this month . Said Hannifin : " That ' bottle , ' as big as a mixing bowl , had spent a couple of years in orbit , re-entered and was not even scratched . That 's been on my mind lately . " <P> Also on Hannifin 's mind was a sentimental visit he paid this year to an old friend : Baker , who along with the late Able became the first monkeynaut pair in 1959 . Hannifin found Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , playing with a plastic model of the space shuttle and living tranquilly while others venture ever deeper into outer space .
