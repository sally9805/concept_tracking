Oct. 22 , 1934 , G-Man Melvin Purvis cornered Bank Robber Charles ( " Pretty Boy " ) Floyd in a farmhouse near East Liverpool , Ohio . When Floyd , armed with two .45-cal. pistols , fled across a stubbled cornfield toward the woods , Purvis and his men shot him to death . It was one of the most celebrated exploits of the G-men , forerunners of the present-day FBI agents , and enhanced Purvis ' reputation as one of the country 's ablest crime fighters . The story of Floyd 's death stood unchallenged for almost 45 years . <P> Last week , however , retired East Liverpool Police Captain Chester C. Smith , now 84 , came forward with a far different account of Floyd 's death . One of six officers who accompanied Purvis that day , Smith was the first to spot Floyd trying to escape . Said Smith : " I knew Purvis could n't hit him , so I dropped him with two shots from my .32 Winchester rifle . " Stunned but not seriously wounded , Floyd sat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Smith , Purvis ran up and ordered : " Back away from that man . I want to talk to him . " Pretty Boy glared and cursed . At which point , said Smith , Purvis turned to G-Man Herman Hollis and said : " Fire into him . " Hollis obeyed , said Smith , killing Floyd with a burst from a tommy gun . <P> Was there a coverup ? " Sure was , " said Smith , " because they did n't want it to get out that he 'd been killed that way . " Smith , who was promoted to captain following Floyd 's killing , said he decided it was proper to set the record straight now because , of the seven men involved , only he remains alive - and the truth can no longer hurt anyone .
