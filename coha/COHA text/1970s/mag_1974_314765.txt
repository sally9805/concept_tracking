I do n't think that teen-agers should have to ask their parents about contraceptives or abortions ; these are their own concerns . <P> Parents may disagree , but many teen-agers and a growing number of physicians concur with that statement by Leah Newman , 16 , a member of a New York City high school group advocating freedom of sex information . Civil liberties groups are also leaning toward the concept that teen-agers should be able to get medical services where sex is concerned , without involving their parents . In a U.S. district court , two pregnant 16-year-old Boston girls recently won a delay in enforcement of a state law that requires them to obtain parental permission for abortions . But despite some progress , the medical rights of those under 18 remain unclear , particularly when it comes to preventing or ending pregnancy . <P> In many states , minors must obtain parental permission to get a prescription for the Pill or to obtain an abortion . Only 23 states have clearly recognized the rights of minors to use contraceptives ; in only 16 states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions have actually restricted the medical sex rights of minors . The Utah Supreme Court has overturned a lower court ruling that would have eliminated the requirement for parental permission for contraceptives . The court held that giving contraceptives to unmarried minors would make them " more likely to commit the crime of fornication and to become infected with venereal disease . " <P> Emancipated Youth . Some states still have laws requiring doctors to obtain parental permission before administering even emergency treatment to minors . But no physician who begins treatment necessary to save a child before the parents can be located is likely to be prosecuted . Nor will many state attorneys act against doctors who provide sex-related care to minors without parental approval . Many physicians would nonetheless like to see restrictions further eased . " We have failed to recognize the rights of children as people in many areas , " says Dr. Lee Salk , pediatric psychologist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center . " Teenagers should be treated as if they have the capacity for making decisions . " <P> One step in that direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution , which lowered the voting age to 18 . Forty-one states have also lowered the age of majority from 21 to 18 . As a result , 18-year-olds now have fewer problems obtaining sex-related medical services . Their right to any type of medical care has been recognized in 35 states . In all but two states ( Nebraska and Wyoming ) , 18-year-olds do not need parental consent to get most pregnancy-related health services , including abortion . And all 50 states allow anyone over 18 to be treated for venereal disease on their own .
