The first distinctive changes were cautious : fluttering , real-life lashes and movable glass eyes . Later , as the times grew more daring , belly buttons appeared between skimpy bikini halves ; dimpled knees and smooth , fleshy thighs flashed below microminis ; nipples poked through braless blouses . Even mannequins , it seems , keep up with the times . <P> Last week a window of Manhattan 's R.H. Macy 's displayed the latest trend in store dummies : " groupings . " There , apparently engaged in conversation , was a trio of plastic , stylized males with featureless faces and bald heads . Such clusters of interacting mannequins , now on display at many major department stores , often waltz , golf , and even play baseball , as silent spectators look on at the fence .

More recently , they have created " the ethnic look " : dummies with Mexican , Eurasian or Oriental features .

Williams &; Co. to mold the boss 's wife , comely Pamela Sakowitz , in plastic . With the aid of photographs and sittings , Williams created a series of plastic Pams as a display gimmick for Sakowitz windows .
