txt There was n't a snap brim hat in the room and the jingle in someone 's pocket was more likely to be a Phi Beta Kappa key than a pair of handcuffs . Eliot Ness would have felt misplaced among the smooth , articulate crowd of 400 government-trained prosecutors and agents who gathered recently in an elegant hotel in downtown Washington to spend $247,822 of the government 's money swapping " war stories . " But the button-down crime fighters , here for a nationwide federal conference on organized crime , heard something Ness never heard . The head of the FBI , Clarence Kelley , told this bunch of untouchables that they have the syndicate on the ropes . STANDING IN THE sparkling mirrored concourse of the Mayflower Hotel , members of the conference sipped coffee from the hotel 's white china and talked of how they have succeeded . Where Ness might have sung the praises of heavy bumpers on a flivver to crash through a bootlegger 's door , the New Yorkers trusted the use of electronics by bright young prosecutors . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " body recorder " on a strayed-from-the-fold New York policeman to nail the city 's entire 13th Division for taking payoffs from gamblers . THAT " BODY WIRE , " along with bugs in the undercover officer 's car , recorded 75 tape reels of evidence and Tona obtained indictments against 25 policemen . Of them 24 were convicted . Ness used to have trouble-simply tracing telephone calls . Think how he could have used project " Octopus . " " Octopus " star ted when someone called into a phone already tapped by federal police to arrange to pay a winning horse bet . A tap was placed on the boolonaker 's line and each time a new caller was.recorded he , too , was tapped . " OCTOPUS " RAN FOR six months and police in New York filled 4,500 tapes with betting chatter . Each tape ran two hours and the prosecutors spent nearly 9,000 man-hours listening to prepare the case . It cost mow , but obtained 117 indictments . Wayne Kerstetter , dapper superintendent of the Illinois Bureau of Investigation , told a story about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed since the feds camped on Frank NM 's doorstep to harass him . Kerstetter 's story , presented in a formal , scholarly paper , tells how syndicate chief tian Sam Giancana took J. Edgar Hoover to court for following him too closely . GIANCANA , KILLED June 19 , wen a 1964 court decision which ordered Hoover to take all but one carload of agents off a long-standing Giancana stake-out . That court also told the Chicago feds that " at least one foursome must intervene between Giancana and the FBI surveillance agents on the golf course , " wrote Kerstetter . Samuel Skinner , U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois , confined his " war stories " largely to accounts of the cases involving former Gov . Otto Kerner and the 200 other public officials indicted by the Illinois federal prosecutor 's office . SKINNER , WHO DRESSES better than TV 's Kojak , also predicted " major prosecutions " in the next few months on a mammoth cargo , theft , fencing , and distribution ring in Chicago . The stolen goods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wholesaling them through disltribution firms the syndicate secretly owns , Skinner said . I A lawman with the unlikely moniker of James H. Jeffries III presented a pa-Per which gives a scholarly account of the history of syndicate infiltration into business . IT ALL DATES back to April 20 , 1931 , ! explains Jeffries in language far more ! evocative of Jake " Greasy - Thumb " IGuzik than Arnold Toynbee . April 20 , 1931 , was the " Night of the ! Sicilian Vespers , " according to Jeffries when " all over New York , Chicago , and several other large cities , very significant Italian figures were being smoked ; killed . " The motive Jeffries said , was n't figwed out until the late 1950s when the ' fabled raid at Appalachin Cabin in Up- ! state New York netted 60 hoods and businessmen plotting together . BEHIND THE " Sicilian Vespers " was an internal mob debate over whether to buy into business , Jeffries explained . Presumably those who did n't want to buy in were " smoked . " I A legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! child is going to want to go to parochial ! school and admit to his or her peers that daddy blows people away for a liv ; big ? . " These caps have learned more from the mob than just its lingo . Police now use legitimate business as a front for ; their activities . FOR INSTANCE , THERE was New ! York 's " Operation , Christmas Tree . " ' Members of the New York district attorney 's office needed to know- what was ' being said in a tavern in the Canarsie ! neighborhood of Brooklyn and were def flied a wiretap . ! So three city detectives rented an empty lot directly across the street and began selling Christmas trees . They frequently dropped in at the tavern to warm up and soon became friends with the people inside . Those contacts allowed the Brooklyn police to crack a hijacking ring and obtain 100 indictments on bribery , con-. tempt , gambling , and grand larceny . " The trees sold well , too , " said one detective . THOSE KINDS OF successes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against organized crime , FBI director Kelley told the conference . This work , he said , was the " one solid ray of light " in the worst crime climate in the nation 's history . Richard Velde , administrator of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration which sponsored the conference ; , said that in , recent years the new breed of lawmen has scored these successes : Out of 17,831 joint federal-local investigations , files have been compiled on 71 , - 442 syndicate members ; there have been 6,152 mobsters arrested and 3,199 indicted . THE WASHINGTON conference cost $247,822 and was paid for out of Velde 's budget . New Jersey Gov . Brendan Byrne , a keynote speaker of the conference , told the gathering that it was a " shame " that they are carrying on their crusade " when there is no more Estes Kefauver and no more Joe Valachi " to get public attention . " These are not quite the days when it is glamorous to fight organized crime , " he said . " With . the Godfather , Parts One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less popular side of the issue . " But fighting the mob may have its rewards , even if the glamor has gone . Apparently it 's easier than fighting other crime . While organized crime is being battered , Kelley said , street crime is occurring at the rate of 10 million incidents a year .
