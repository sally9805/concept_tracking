txt President Carter 's campaign pledge to cut U.S. defense costs is about to slam into the new realities of growing Soviet military power . White douse officials remain outwardly optimistic . Top adviser Hamilton Jordan , asked whether it was still possible to keep Mr. Carter 's promise to cut several billion dollars from defense , responds emphatically : " Yes . " But skeptics around this defense-oriented capital say there just is n't any quick and easy way to slash $5 billion to $7 billion off the current budget , as Mr. Carter vowed to do during the campaign . The Carter promise may become even harder to keep in light of the rapidly escalating debate over growing Soviet power ? and doubts about what the Soviets plan to do with their new strength . Behind the scenes here , Carter officials are studying a list of about 40 possible changes in the defense budget proposed by former President Ford . The Carter team has also identified some probable cuts ? thought to total in the $2 billion to $3 billion range . The budget changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of February . Defense specialists on Capitol . Hill say any reductions in the budget would probably involve two areas : costly weapons purchases and manpower . The easiest way to slow defense spending is to delay the purchase of weapons for a few years , or possibly to scrap a major weapons system , such as the proposed B-1 bomber . // From page 1 *Realities'of U.S. arms cuts In the long run , the most lucrative area for cuts , say Capitol Hill authorities , is in manpower costs , which now total more than half of all defense spending . But the entire budget process has been sensitized by the current debate over Soviet intentions . Defense experts here are producing dozens of charts , graphs , and studies to show that for the first time , Soviet military power is approaching the U.S. in overall strength . In terms of military spending , trends appear to be running against the United States : In the past four years , for example , the Soviets have outproduced the U.S. six-to-one in tanks , three-to-one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-to-one in aircraft . Since 1965 , the Soviets have developed seven new types of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles ( ICBMs ) ; the U.S. only one . The Soviets now have more ICBMs and more submarine-launched ballistic missiles than the U.S. ? and they are reducing the American lead in bombers . Looking further ahead , the Soviets are devoting more resources to procurement of equipment , as well as research and development of new weapons , than the U.S. An estimated 800,000 or more Soviet engineers are working on military projects , compared with about 550,000 in the United States . During the campaign , Mr. Carter spelled out his vision for the U.S. military : " A simpler , better organized , more efficient , more muscular fighting force . " Mr. Carter contended that the U.S. could get more for its money from its military , if the number of troops and bases overseas were reduced , if the military could get along with fewer overlapping weapons systems , and if computers and other modern devices were used in managing its 3 million personnel . But those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction of defense spending of which he spoke during the campaign . Early indications are that the Carter administration will try to pare defense costs in this first year by lowering the Pentagon 's sights on weapons procurement ? and by a 10,000 man reduction in the size of the Army . Among the possible cuts mentioned by Defense Secretary Harold Brown : only five B-1 bombers in fiscal 1978 , instead of the eight that Mr. Ford had asked for ; Only 72 F-15 fighters , instead of 108 ; Elimination of $100 million from the budget . for new Minuteman III missiles ; Abandonment of plans to build a $1 billion nuclear strike cruiser ; Elimination of three of the Marine Corps ' 12 F-4 fighter squadrons .
