THE TELEVISION CAMERA zooms up to the man seated behind the conference table . It focuses for a moment on his perfectly manicured hands . folded in front of him , on the wafer-thin gold watch and gold band on his left wrist , on the heavy rubyand-gold cuff links . It slides upward across the intricately woven fabric of his shirt , the heavy dark silk necktie , the perfect set of the wide lapels of his suit coat . The camera briefly examines the emblem he wears in his buttonhole ? an outline map of the United States in green , white , and red enamel with the figure " 1 " superimposed ? then fixes on his face . It is a bit fleshy but it glows with the result of sunlamp and massage . The black hair is thinning above a heavy brow . The brown eyes are shrewd . The nose is strong and slightly hooked , the jaw outthrust , the lips compressed . He is poised and radiates a sense of power . It is clear , as he begins speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being listened to with respect . This is Joseph Colombo , Sr. , forty-eight years old ; father of five children , grandfather of two ; Brdoklyn homeowner ; hardworking salesman of real estate , floral displays , and automobiles ; partner in an undertaking establishment ; owner of a dress factory ; and founder of the Italian-American Civil Rights League , whose emblem he wears . He is also , according to law-enforcement agencies , a capo mafioso who heads an underworld " family " with interests in gambling , loan-sharking , hijacking , and the theft and disposal of securities , and has himself served time in jail for contempt of a grand jury , has been convicted of perjury , and has been indicted for income-tax evasion , as an offender under the new federal organized-crime law , and for assertedly sharing in the proceeds of a $750,000 jewelry theft . With sincerity dripping from every pore , Colombo is declaring that the Mafia , or Cosa Nostra , as it is sometimes called , exists only in the minds of bigots who use it as a means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , and himself , his wife , and their children in particular . It is a theme that loftily ignoring all evidence to the contrary , he has repeated on enough television news programs , talk shows , and press interviews to make himself a celebrity . Although it is nominally a charitable organization , the Italian-American Civil Rights League under Colombo 's leadership seems to be most interested in advancing the same viewpoint . Farfetched and self ? serving as it may be , a surprisingly large number of Italian-Americans without reputed criminal connections appear to believe that it is correct . The League claims to have enrolled 50,000 members and to have established chapters in scores of cities across the country in its first year of existence . While expressing support in general terms , Italian-American politicians and professional men have tended to keep Colombo and the League at arm 's length . Most of its support has come from blue-collar and lower-middle-class families who live in or near old city centers rather than in the suburbs . Their response reflects , it seems to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which assumed that in time the nation of immigrants would blend into an homogenized new product , has not quite worked out as expected . and that it may not be desirable after all . Racial , religious , and ethnic consciousness are being perceived more often as sources of stability in the chaos and anonymity of American life . and there is a corresponding unwillingness among blacks . Chicanos , Puerto Ricans. and the European " ethnics " to accept the judgment of relative inferiority placed on them by " old stock " Americans . At the same time , however , Italian-Americans. who have generally returned to the conservatism of their peasant forebears as they have lifted themselves out of the proletariat , have been resentful of the rapid social progress made in recent years by blacks and others who have previously been in a comfortingly inferior position . Having waited patiently behind the Irish and the Jews for a chance at middle- and upper-level jobs in government , business , and the professions , the Italian-Americans who support the League now fear that they will be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tarred with the Mafia brush . the blacks seem to gain ground by riot , arson , savage threats , and every other sort of criminal behavior , and enjoy the support of the country 's intellectual leaders as they do so . Italians , particularly southern Italians and Sicilians , have traditionally been distrustful , usually with good reason , of governments and politicians , preferring to repose their trust in the family and clan ; and their descendants in this country have not lost the habit . In the same way , with a few exceptions , Italian-American politicians have been a venal and unprepossessing lot . Under the circumstances , it is oddly appropriate that Joe Colombo . the reputed bandit boss , has turned himself into the protector of the leaderless paisanos of the dying cities , and combined with this ancient role a mastery of media manipulation and propaganda . Who else would have had the boldness and imagination , not to mention the pure brass , to picket the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to force the deletion of the offensive terms Mafia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mario Puzo 's novel , and thereby give a heightened reality to a romantic tale about the great power of organized crime ? T LIE ITALIAN-AMERICAN Civil Rights League had its beginnings last year on the day that Colombo 's second son , Joseph , Jr. , twenty-four years old , with no previous criminal record , was arrested on a federal charge of conspiring to melt down 5300,000 in United States silver coins into more valuable ingots . " The highest respect I ever had ? I got to put it in the past tense ? I had for the FBI , " the senior Colombo told me . " It was an organization that , if they had you , they came and that was it . No games . I never believed they would frame anybody . But they told me they would get me ? they would frame me ? and if it was n't me they 'd get my children . I could n't believe it until the day of . . . reality ... until last April 30 , where they locked up Joe Jr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Jr . was acquitted when the key government witness changed his testimony , and thereby demonstrated that he would rather go to jail for perjury than to help send a member of the Colombo family there . ) That night , Colombo and a group of friends , some of whom where described by the police as Mafia associates . turned up outside the FBI headquarters on Manhattan 's Third Avenue . Marching back and forth , they loudly cursed the name of J. Edgar Hoover . It was the first recorded example of lese majesty toward the aged director , which has now , of course , become commonplace . For more than a , year the pickets marched , led by the smiling , stocky Colombo . On some occasions their numbers swelled into the thousands , and they were always far more gently handled by the police than , say , war protesters would have been . In June , Colombo decided to go a step farther . He organized what he called Italian-American Unity Day at Columbus Circle . Ignoring Columbus Day , he called it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city were closed ? partly as a result , it was suggested , of veiled warnings ? and something like 100,000 persons turned out . They wore green , white , and red sashes , and buttons that said , " Kiss Me , I 'm Italian . " Deputy Mayor Richard Aurelio , the highest ranking Italian-American in city government , represented Mayor John V. Lindsay , who is thoroughly disliked by Italian-Americans as someone w ho has ignored them to curry favor with blacks and Puerto Ricans . Aurelio managed to smile through the boos as he accepted for himself and the mayor honorary membership in the League . Anyone who can deliver 100,000 persons automatically becomes someone of consequence . Only a month later . Attorney General John Mitchell , while not apparently abandoning his efforts to put Colombo in jail , tried to pacify a suddenly rebellious segment of the Silent Majority . He announced that government agencies , including the Department of Justice and the FBI , would no longer use the terms Mafia and Cosa Nostra , to avoid giving " gratuitous offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by terms without ethnic connotations , such as " organized crime " or " the syndicate . " Several state governors , including Nelson Rockefeller of New York , issued similar decrees . Colombo decided to keep rolling . In August he announced the formation of the Italian-American Civil Rights League . He appointed an amiable companion named Natale Marcone as president , and his oldest son , Anthony Colombo , as vice-president . For himself he reserved the title of founder and all the pow er . In November the League held a gala at Madison Square Garden that raised 5450,000 for its treasury . Among the performers was Frank Sinatra . Several years earlier he had been briefly the head of the Italian-American Anti-Defamation League , which was laughed out of existence when it was revealed that several members of its board of directors had reputed Mafia connections . Having met and conquered the politicians without raising a sweat . Colombo turned next to the entertainment industry , probably aware that it has always been extremely sensitive to pressure groups . In January , when production was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u rote a letter of protest to Robert Evans . the vice-president in charge of production . The hook , The Godfather . although fiction , is a spurious and slanderous account of the Italian-American , " the letter said . " Therefore , we feel the filming of this hook is. if you w ill permit us poetic license , ' the straw that broke the Italian ? American 's back . ' " After noting the Attorney General 's order , it continued , " We feel that in accordance with these directives , you should do everything in your power to delete the words ' Mafia ' and ' Cosa Nostra ' and the characterization of Italians being ' gangsters ' from this movie . The Italian-American Civil Rights League 's officers , captains , and members are prepared to publicly demonstrate , and use all legal means at our command to stop this blatant affront on the integrity , heritage and values of the Italian-American people . " A copy of the letter was sent to every member of Congress and to members of the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scores of letters from these lawmakers were received by Paramount . Peter W. Rodino , Jr. , a New Jersey Democrat who is an assistant majority whip of the House of Representatives , writing , as he said , on behalf of himself and " other members of Congress of Itato-American heritage , " said that the motion-picture and television industries had failed to establish or enforce standards to prevent productions " that defame , stereotype , ridicule , demean and degrade ethnic , racial and religious groups . " At the end of March , 1,000 persons honored Colombo at a $125-a ? plate testimonial dinner as the " guiding light of Italian-American unity . " A few days later , at a press conference with Nat Mar-cone , Al Ruddy , the producer of The Godfather , announced that all references to the Mafia and the Cosa Nostra would be removed from the script and that the receipts of the gala premiere performance of the film would be donated to the League . In return . said Marcone , the League would assist Ruddy in finding locations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for minor roles and extra work . Ruddy 's agreement set off a considerable stir . Gulf &; Western Industries , the conglomerate of which Paramount is a small part , said that the film studio had acted without its knowledge or consent . Paramount said that Ruddy had acted without its consent , but let his decision stand so far as the elimination of the word Mafia was concerned . It was not , however , prepared to surrender the receipts . The New York Times carried the story of the press conference on page one and published an editorial headed , " Yes , Mr. Ruddy , There Is a ... " The paper condemned the producer 's decision as " the latest chapter in that incredible campaign to make the Mafia disappear by expunging the term from the American language . " And yet , for several weeks thereafter . the Times , as well as the News and the Post , carried stories about organized crime in which the word was conspicuous by its absence . A s a public figure , Colombo faced the cameras and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unashamedly Brooklynese and ungrammatical , and operatically emotional . " We feel we 're being discriminated against , " he said . " The Italian people are good people , honest people , sincere people , lovable people who were satisfied when they came to this country that they owned a car and a little house , and when they got it , that was it . They went to sleep . And we say it 's time that the Italian-Americans woke up and demanded what rightfully is theirs . If you 're given a present you say ' please ' and ' thank you . ' But anything that 's coming to you you do n't have to say please . ' You can demand . And we know that every President who 's elected he gives to all ethnic groups a piece of the pie , but where are we ? " We say there is a conspiracy against every Italian-American , " Colombo said , speaking louder and faster , " and I can prove it . Show me what Italian is in what caliber of position in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , in every field and every endeavor . How do we figure that no President in the history of the country had enough confidence to appoint an Italian to the Supreme Court ? " Wishing that Colombo had never broken the underworld 's iron rule of - ornerta , or silence , I finally managed to pose a question . Why , I asked , had Italian-Americans been singled out for such treat-ment ? " We 'd like to know that , the answer to that question , " he replied . Without pausing , he asked Caesar Vitale , the young secretary-treasurer of the League , to get " the Hughes book . " Vitale returned promptly with the 1970 Report of the New York State Joint Legislative Committee on Crime , Its Causes , Control and Effect on Society , whose chairman is State Senator John H. Hughes . After riffling through the pages Colombo slid it across the table to me . " This book lists only Italians , " he said . " Is it possible in New York that only Italians have committed crimes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his grip on syntax and metaphor , never secure , tends to disintegrate . " If this fits the shoe of every governmental agency , " he declared , beginning to wave his arms , " of every politician so that we are the scapegoats to pay the bill for their sins , when will it stop and where will it stop ? I mean I was n't born free of sin but I sure could n't be all the things that people have said ? I got torture chambers in my cellar , I 'm a murderer , I 'm the head of every shylock ring , of every bookmakin ' ring , I press buttons and I have enterprises in London , at the airports I get seven , eight million dollars a year revenue out of there , Who are they kiddin ' and how far will they go to kid the public ? " The Hughes dossier on Colombo says that he was installed in 1964 as the boss of the Mafia family headed by Joseph Profaci until his death , of natural causes . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by his deputy , Joseph Magliocco . The protagonist of The Godfather , Don Vito Corleone , appears to have been modeled in part on Profaci . Both were large legitimate importers of olive oil , for example , both lived in heavily guarded Long Island estates , 50 and both were modest and retiring in demeanor . ) " Joseph Colombo 's appointment as boss was an effort to bring the family together and end the internal strife that had persisted since the death of Joseph Profaci , " the dossier goes on , " and should be credited to Joe Bonanno 's attempt to gain control of the Commission . Bonanno had issued three death warrants for Thomas Luchese ( deceased ) , Carlo Gambino , and Stefano Magaddino to Magliocco . Magliocco , in turn , gave these contracts to Colombo . Colombo , instead of executing the contracts , informed the Commission of Bonanno 's attempt on their lives . As a reward Magliocco was removed , and shortly thereafter , Colombo was given his family , as well as his seat on the Commission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be merely an echo of Gambino . " This is Mafiaology in the classic tradition ? a peek into the machinations of the crime kingdom . None of it is provable . but the men who are named in such analyses are seldom in a position to sue for libel , and it may be true enough , but Colombo pointed out that the dossier does n't even get the number of his children right , and I asked him to straighten out the record . H IS ROOTS WERE CALABRIAN ( the southernmost province in Italy ) rather than Sicilian on both sides of his family , he said . and he was born and grew up in the Bath Beach section of Brooklyn . " My father , his name was Anthony , died when I was thirteen . " Had he become ill , I asked . " He met with an accident , " Colombo replied . " He was murdered . " How had it happened ? Colombo just shook his head . " He was murdered , he was killed , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned later that the father , Anthony Colombo , reputedly a minor underworld figure , had been found with a woman friend , both dead , in an automobile . They had been garroted , the traditional , rather elegant means of Mafia rub-out , and one used on at least two occasions in The Godfather . " They say I was brought up in a life of crime , " Colombo went on . " Would you believe any father would bring up his son to do anything bad ? " Think . ing again of The Godfather , I replied that I had heard of such instances , but , smiling sadly , Colombo appeared not to hear . His father 's death left the family in straitened circumstances , he said , and he began working after school and on weekends . He left high school after his second year to go to work in a butcher shop . " I was what they call half a butcher , " he said . " Like an apprentice . He bones out meat , chops meat , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturdays for my mother . When I was sixteen I got my working papers . I had a night job in a factory in Manhattan . I made molds for little Santa Clauses and dolls . I got $12 a week . " When the war began I went into the Coast Guard , " he went on . " I did n't have to go . My mother was a widow and I was an only son . I vol-o unteere unteered to go overseas , and I was assigned to convoys from Norfolk to the Mediterranean on a destroyer escort . I made five or six trips . One time I was in a fight on the fantail . Just two sailors having a fight . The exec said I was going to be transferred to the Pacific , and when we got back to Brooklyn he would n't let me leave the ship . I had gotten married and so I jumped ship . I stayed home twenty-nine days and when I turned myself in I got a general court-martial . " Colombo did n't mention it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had remained away for another day or two be would have been guilty of desertion rather than absence without leave : In any case , he was sentenced to a year 's confinement , but was transferred to a naval hospital after three months and was discharged in March 1945 with a 10 per cent disability pension because of psychoneurosis and his " inability " to adapt to military life . It was in 1946 that Colombo 's first arrests took place . The charges were trivial ? playing craps in the street ? and for three offenses he was fined a grand total of $4 . How had a street-wise guy like him come to be caught at all , I asked . " I do n't know if you ever shot dice as a kid , " he replied , " but when the radio car used to pull up the cops would yell , Tun , ' so that the few pennies or the dollars that was on the ground would remain there . . . " Here he mimed the guardians of the law scooping up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on the docks and worked nights in a bakery . He avoided saying what his dock job consisted of , and it may have been completely honest , but the New York waterfront has always been a notorious fief of organized crime . In 1957 he became a salesman for a wholesale meat company , which , I learned later , was controlled by a brother of Carlo Gambino , now the head of New York 's most powerful Mafia family . In 1960 , he started selling real estate and began to acquire , again in ways he does not care to explain , his other business interests . " In my top year I earned about $20,000 , " he said . thrusting his palms outward . " For the hours I put in there I would 've been better off going down on the docks . " ( The owner of the firm later supplied one of those unforgettable descriptions of his ace salesman . " He 's got the most sincerest group of clients , " the man said . " They never try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much of Colombo 's busy business life depends on the high regard in which he seems to be held in the predominately Italian-American Bath Beach , Bensonhurst , and Canarsie sections of Brooklyn . He receives $5,000 a year from a florist ? " If someone wants a floral piece I recommend them and I get a commission , " he said ? and has a similar arrangement with a Buick dealer . In 1965 Colombo came to police notice for the first time as a major figure in organized crime when he was seen at a meeting at a Catskills hotel with Sonny Franzese , a notorious gunman for the Profaci family , and Larry and Albert Gallo , two of the three brothers who had led a faction in a revolt against the Profaci family a few years earlier . ( This dust-up provided the basis for the only comic treatment of the Mafia in fiction , Jimmy Breslin 's The Gang That Could n't Shoot Straight , which is also being made into a film . ) The next year Colombo was arrested at a meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he declined to answer satisfactorily questions put to him about the meeting by a grand jury after it granted him immunity , he was sentenced to thirty days in jail for contempt . ( Arrests for consorting with known criminals and contempt citations are frequently used to keep the pressure on reputed racketeers . ) " I never had a bite of food , " Colombo told me with exasperation . " I never even got my coat off . What excuse do you need to eat with someone ? Why do they think it 's sinister about Italian people when they meet ? " Moreover , he says , his na ? vet ? was responsible for his jail sentence . " In those days , " he said , " I was so green that I did n't know a grand jury subpoena from a parking ticket . " After that , troubles begin piling up for Colombo . He was trailed by city detectives , FBI agents , and the Internal Revenue Service . His phone was probably tapped . He was charged with perjury for concealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broker 's license ? " I just wanted to better myself , " he said ? convicted and sentenced to one to two-and-a-half years in prison . ( He is free on bail while the conviction is being appealed . ) He was indicted for evading $19,169 in federal income taxes from 1963 through 1967 ; he was indicted in Nassau County for complicity in the $750,000 jewelry theft ; and just a few months ago he was indicted again ? under the new organized crime statutesunder which interstate activity does not have to be proved ? in Federal Court in Brooklyn , as the head of a multimillion-dollar bookmaking ring . Colombo has an explanation for these misfortunes . " For as long as I could remember , " he said , " the homicide squad , the CID . the CIB . the CIA , the FBI , the tax people , they 've been watchin ' me twenty-four hours a day . If I could commit a crime with all this security , all this surveillance , then you are talkin ' to one big genius , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed bitterly . " Anybody who would commit a crime and go against this government , " he said , " is crazy , because you 're a loser before you start . They say I earned $100,000 in five years and spent $150,000 . They went into my garbage pail . They counted the Coca-Cola cans . They surveilled me for three years . They argued for $1.05 for ninety minutes . They say I got $7,500 from that jewelry robbery . How much is that ? One per cent . If I 'm the kind of man they say I am , do you think I 'd be satisfied with one per cent ? " What 's the use , " he said , his hands palms upward . " I 'm a trophy on the wall . Any DA who can finally convict Joe Colombo and put him in jail ? it 's a big accomplishment . " His voice dropped . " This is a big accomplishment. to put a man in jail ? " We got a double standard with bail bonds , with sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you know any Italian that 's in jail , his records get stamped O.C. , ' for ' organized crime . ' 0 . C. means only for Italian people . They do the last day of their sentencin ' . I got one to two-and-a-half for checking the wrong box on a form . If I lose my appeal I guarantee I 'll do twenty months , even if I 'm a model prisoner . Because there 'll be O.C. on my record . " But in late spring , as the League prepared for its second Unity Day on June 28 , there were signs of new troubles . The Internal Revenue Service , which has refused to grant the League a tax exemption , was believed to be looking into the disposition of the more than $1.000.000 it had raised , a good part of which had already been spent on a 10-acre site for a hospital and home for the aged in Brooklyn and a children 's summer camp on the Jersey shore . And although the League 's red , white and green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Italy , some of its storefront offices in the city were closing down , and there were rumors that other Mafia leaders , who had maintained an attitude of wary neutrality , had finally decided that Colombo was turning out to be a nuisance . Joe ( Crazy Joe ) Gallo , the most fearsome and ambitious of the brothers , was released from prison , and soon after there were reports that an unknown group of men , disguised as house painters , had roughed up Colombo and Nat Mar-cone on a Brooklyn street . On June 8 , suddenly , the picketing of the FBI ended . All Colombo would say was that the League 's objectives had been fulfilled , but once again it was said that underworld pressure had been brought to hear . YEN AFTER THE OUTCRY over the Al Ruddy npress conference had died down , rumors continued to circulate about the filming of The Godfather . Pete Hamill , in his column in the New York Post , wrote , The movie business in New York has been heavy with rumors ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the film started . Actors were signed , and suddenly found that they had other commitments . Unknowns were guaranteed roles in the film by the pinkie ring guys in the Lower East Side joints , in exchange for lifetime cuts for the Mob . " At about the same time , Vic Damone , the singer , announced that he had decided not to play the role of Johnny Fontane , the figure in the book thought to resemble Frank Sinatra . " As an American of Italian descent , " Damone was quoted as saying , " I could not in good conscience continue in the role . " A few days later a " clarification " appeared in both Earl Wilson 's column in the Post and Ed Sullivan 's in the Daily News . " For the record , " Wilson wrote , " Vic Damone told me the reason he gave up his role ... was that the part consisted of only one page of dialogue . ( The money was short . the billing was nothing , and I heard the theme song would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-page part ! ' 1 " Ruddy is a tall , slender man of thirty:six . He wears the contemporary Hollywood uniform ? black turtleneck sweater , black flared corduroy trousers , a wide belt , and Italian loafers . His sunglasses were pushed back into his long curling hair . I asked him if he was having any trouble replacing Damone . " Replacing him ! " Ruddy exclaimed . " Damone was desperate to do the part , but he had never been signed . He was one of three men under consideration , and he was n't even our first choice . That was Al Martino and we got him . " Ruddy said that when he learned of the Italian-American Civil Rights League 's opposition to the filming , he decided , without informing the Para mount executives , to meet with the officers to see if something could n't be worked out . " When I sat down with Anthony Colombo I realized immediately that what they wanted us to do in no way deviated from my own objectives , " Ruddy said . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the League to forestall criticism elsewhere . It 's not so , of course . " Given the fact that the Attorney General and several state governors had suppressed the use of " Mafia " and " Cosa Nostra , " he went on , he saw no reason for holding out , particularly since the words were used only a couple of times in the script , could be replaced by " family " or " syndicate " with no loss of meaning , and the main characters would remain unmistakably Italian- American . " A couple of weeks before the press conference I talked to a meeting of captains of the League , " Ruddy said . " I told them the film would be in no sense anti-Italian. r said that if anything it is an incrimination of a whole society , and that 's the w ay I really feel about it . In this country all that matters is if you have the bread . One thing you 've got to say about the Mafia is that it at least conducts crime in a reliable way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times I 've heard young people say they would prefer to deal with the Mafia for speed and acid and grass . They say , ' At least you 'd know what you were getting . ' " I knew I was putting Paramount in an awkward position , " he went on , " but I was doing it for my own reasons . I 'm a moviemaker and I just want to make movies ; I wanted to create the circumstances under which I could make this movie . " Ruddy 's calculations were correct . Nat Marcone helped him to find the location for the " Mall , " Don Vito Corleone 's fortress-home , on Staten Island , where the League has shown its muscle in a feud with the Staten Island Advance over the newspaper 's exposes of Mafia activities . Marcone also made sure that quiet , co-operative crowds leaned out of their windows on Mulberry Street to cheer Marlon Brando , made up stooped and sixtvish to play the Don , as he was shot down in a gun battle outside the loft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olive oil company . It was n't possible to tell how much influence , if any , the League had had in getting actors into the cast , but I happened to be in Colombo 's office when Tony Darrow , the League 's " official vocalist ' , " called to say he did n't get the part he was trying out for . i lltiANY PATRIOTIC ITALIAN-AMERICANS have de-Inounced Mario Puzo for writing The Godfather . " I never wrote this book as a putdown of Italians , " Puzo told me . " I 'm sort of proud they 're so clever in crime . In fact I even believe they have a natural gift for it ? the southern Italians and the Sicilians . It was the only way they could stay alive . It 's an environmental thing . Certain animals take on a certain coloring over the generations because of the terrain . At the same time they 're the most bourgeois of peoples . If they can graduate into the respectable middle class , they 'll do it . But it 's true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help striking . They 'll never lose that . They could be making $5 million legitimately , but they ca n't resist that hundred-grand stickup . " Puzo said he knew very little about the Mafia . " I was looking to present a myth , " he said . " That 's what real fiction is about . A legend . That 's why The Godfather takes place twenty or twenty-five years ago . If I really knew more about it I would n't have written so popular a book . To me The Godfather is n't an expose ; it 's a romantic novel . When the Times came out with an editorial about how terrible it was that the word ' Mafia ' was dropped , I did n't care . If I was in the League , though , I 'd want the word ' Mafia ' to be used because it makes the Mafia look good . " The old-generation Mafia were the smartest guys alive , " he said . " The younger generation are dummies . All I can tell you is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish guys . They were brought up in a milieu where they had to have their wits about them . I think the Mafia is already dead , I really do . What 's left is just the dregs . It 's not like the days of Profaci and Genovese . Colombo is a man of some importance , but if he had a really big empire he would n't be doing this . " Puzo is fifty years old , two years older than Joe Colombo , and , Iike him , the father of five children . He grew up in the old Hell 's Kitchen on the West Side of Manhattan during Prohibition and the Depression , and while he says he never ran with the gangs , many of the incidents in The Godfather came out of his own experience . " Stories about crime were part of the culture , " he said . " On Tenth Avenue they called it the Black Hand instead of the Mafia . A couple of things I saw when I was a kid ended up in The Godfather . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air shaft from another apartment . My brother had a dog and the landlord wanted to throw us out . My mother went to some guy and he straightened everything out for us . " Puzo has a massive head on a stocky frame . Behind a mighty paunch he looks like an out-of-shape middleweight boxer , and he is usually either starting a diet or ending one . " That 's an Italian Mafia belly , " he said . " You know what they say , ' A man with a belly , ' meaning a man of power and bearing . That 's me . " What happens is Colombo sees everybody else flouting the law outrageously , like the hiacks and student protesters , " he said . " There 's a psychological process that goes on in his head . He says to himself , ' I 'm better than those guys . Maybe I cut a few corners but I 'm a better citizen than they are , and if they can pull that trick , so can L ' . He really thinks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , or some of those Yippies who praise drugs and free love and all that bullshit . He sees himself as a better family man who loves America more than they do . He probably has n't read my book because he thinks it 's dirty . So he steals a little , cuts a few corners ? what 's so terrible ? " If crime has made at least a few Mafia leaders millionaires , writing about it has done as well for Puzo . Since its publication in March 1969 , more than a million hard-cover and eight million paperback copies of The Godfather have been sold . Paramount got the film rights for a bargain-basement $85.000 . " I sold the film rights on the first 100 pages plus an outline of the rest of it , " Puzo told me . " I thought I was really horn-swoggling Paramount . The $12,500 I got for signing was the most money I ever saw in my life . My earlier novels , The Dark Arena and The Fortunate Pilgrim , did n't make any money , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Puzo received another $100,000 to do the screenplay . After having failed to provide what the studio wanted through four or five rewrites , he walked off the job in February , leaving it for his collaborator , Francis Ford Coppola , to complete . " There were legitimate differences of opinion , " Puzo said , " and there are no hard feelings . What really busted it up was that after Francis did the final rewrite I tried to read the script . I could n't because I was so sick of the material . I said , ' There 's no point because I ca n't react to this script . ' " l 'm not worried about seeing the final version . The director has put his reputation on the line . The least you can do is not get in his way , because it 's not going to affect my reputation but his . H the picture is a failure . he 's got to run for Brazil . He and Al Ruddy , they 've got to hide out . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Godfather , which is like a proven quantity , and if they do n't turn that into a hit they 've got to be out of business . So I figure , why get in their way , why break their chops ? " That Hollywood is a funny place , " Puzo went on . " Here I am , on the basis of this book , every - body tells me I 'm known as one of the greatest storytellers of the Western world . You would think they would do anything to keep me on that picture . But they 're really not that concerned . They do n't really want me , if the truth was known . I 'm an embarrassment . That 's what 's really funny . " F OR TWENTY YEARS NOW , ever since the Kefauver crime hearings of 1951 , the Mafia has usually been described in such tabloid terminology as a brotherhood of evil , an invisible empire of crime , and a cancer gnawing at the nation 's vitals . When the subject is the Mafia , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own skyscrapers , racetracks , vast manufacturing enterprises , banks , and brokerage firms . Its annual profits are put in the hundreds of millions or even billions . One commentator , Professor Donald R. Cressey , in his Theft of the Nation , went so far as to suggest that the 5.000 reported members of the Mafia were probably all millionaires . This school of thought credits the Mafia with the wealth , complexity , and organizational skills of General Motors , and the secrecy , efficient brutality , and amorality of the Russian secret police . Recently , however , what might be called the revisionist theory of Mafiaology has sprung up , andwhile not going quite so far as Joe Colombo , who contends that the Mafia is a figment of fevered paranoid minds , it suggests that while Italian-Americans are active in organized crime and probably dominate it in many areas , they by no means exercise a monopoly , and that , in any case , they are merely taking their turn in a procession that began with old-stock Americans . There are already indications that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in organized crime , are now being replaced in turn by Negroes , particularly in the numbers racket , and by Negroes and Latin-Americans in the immensely lucrative , but dangerous , narcotics trade . In his influential essay , " Crime As an American Way of Life , " Daniel Bell points out that crime has been a ladder of upward social mobility throughout the nation 's history . The origins of many great fortunes can be traced to padded public contracts , bribery of public officials , price-fixing , wholesale violence , and the single-minded avarice characteristic of the average Mafia Shylock . Arguing that the terms Mafia and Cosa Nostra are misleading in that they give an Italian complexion to what is essentially an American activity , Francis A.J. Ianni , in his essay , " The Mafia and the Web of Kinship , " notes that there is no evidence that the leaders of the Sicilian Mafia , the Calabrian " Honored Society , " or the Neapolitan Camorra joined the wave of immigration to the United States from 1885 to the outbreak of World War I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized crime is a post-1930 phenomenon , " he writes . " The strict diffusionist approach that sees only Mafia in halo-American crime syndicates must therefore assume that the concept of Mafia lay dormant among southern Italian immigrants for decades and then suddenly emerged as a model to organize halo ? American involvement in crime . Further , it must assume nothing was happening in the accutturative experience of halo-Americans that allowed them to find better and already proven models in the native American setting . These assumptions do not bear up under analysis . " At the same time , Ianni makes clear that the pecu ! iar strength of the Italian-American criminal syndicates has derived from ties of blood , marriage , and godparenthood , a relationship of great importance among southern Italians . " For Italians , " Ianni writes , " blood is thicker than water and while the organizational form of Mafia disappeared it has left a heritage of kinship which still integrates crime families and characterizes the involvement of Italian-Americans in organized crime . " Of more than sixty Mafiosi identified at the famous " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara in Apalachin , New York , in 1957 , Ianni notes " almost half were related by blood or marriage , and even more if godparent
