President Ford , who has been drawing ringing cheers from audiences of businessmen by promising to get the Government " off your back , " took a first step last week toward making good on his rhetoric . He sent to Congress a plan to loosen greatly federal control of airlines-the tightly regulated industry - with the aim of introducing enough new competition to lower fares significantly . The response to this plan could not have been more different from that to Ford 's speeches : airline executives forecast disaster if the President 's proposed reforms ever go fully into effect , and critics predicted , probably accurately , that Congress would never approve the whole package . <P> At present the Civil Aeronautics Board approves fares , determines routes and decides which lines will be permitted to fly where in the U.S. That system has been denounced as a breeder of inefficiency among airlines because it shelters them from aggressive competition . Ford branded the setup " protectionist . " Key parts of his plan : <P> Airlines would be permitted to raise fares as much as 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20% in each of the first two years that the plan was in operation , without getting CAB approval . <P> Supplemental airlines , now engaged mostly in charter business , could expand into flying scheduled routes , and companies that wanted to start new airlines would be encouraged to do so , on routes of their own choice , if they were " fit , willing and able " to fly . <P> Starting in 1981 airlines could expand their route networks 5% to 10% a year by starting flights to cities that they do not now serve , without CAB O.K. <P> The CAB would be forbidden to approve any deal among airlines that would reduce competition , such as the agreements between lines to cut back schedules jointly . <P> Most airline executives were aghast . <P> <P> Said Trans World Airlines Chairman Charles C. Tillinghast Jr. , in a burst of metaphor mixing : " The current regulatory system has served this country well , and before we play Russian roulette with it , we should make doubly sure that the cure proposed is not worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , called the President 's proposals " misconceived.
