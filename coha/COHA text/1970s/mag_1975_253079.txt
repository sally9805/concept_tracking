One of the few domestic economic accomplishments of the Nixon Administration was to maneuver through Congress a 1973 law that dismantled most of the creaky , and costly , machinery of farm price supports and acreage allotments . Farm prices have shot up in a relatively free market for most of the past two years . Now , however , some of those prices are declining again , bringing to consumers a taste of sorely needed relief in food prices ( TIME , March 24 ) . Unfortunately , this renewed demonstration that free prices go down as well as up has sparked a powerful movement in Congress to bring back the Government 's heavy hand in agriculture . <P> Last week the House passed , 259 to 162 , an " emergency " farm bill that is certain to clear the Senate . The bill would : <P> 1 ) Raise " target prices " of basic commodities . If market prices fall below the targets , the Government will send the farmer a check for the difference . The targets since 1973 have replaced the old-style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commodities and stockpiled them . The new target price would be increased as follows : on wheat from $2.05 per bu. to $3.10 ; on corn from $1.38 per bu. to $2.25 ; on cotton from 38 per Ib. to 45 . <P> 2 ) Increase the support price for milk , one of the few products still under old-fashioned supports , from 75% to 80% of so-called parity . <P> 3 ) Boost the amount of the loans that the Government can make to wheat , corn and cotton raisers who hold their crops off the market while waiting for higher prices and extend the term of the loans to 18 months from the present twelve . <P> <P> That may be only the start of congressional efforts to aid the farmer at the expense of other consumers and taxpayers . Says New York Republican Peter Peyser : " I think there have also been some commitments made on rice and peanuts . The next thing that is going to come up is some direct subsidies for the cattle producer . " <P> The increase in milk supports would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 15 per Ib. on butter , the Department of Agriculture estimates . The rise in target prices on cotton would immediately start Government payments flowing to farmers because the new target price would be above the present market level of about 40 per Ib . The rise could also cause some farmers who had been diverting land from cotton to soybeans to switch back again , thereby shrinking soybean supplies and possibly raising prices of the beans and also of cattle and hogs that are fed on them . <P> Don Paarlberg , chief economist of the Department of Agriculture , figures that the bill would raise retail food costs this year by anywhere from $500 million to $1.2 billion . By the 1977-78 crop year , he estimates , extra payments to farmers under the new bill could cost the taxpayers as much as $7 billion .
