A few groggy tourists , awakened by L guide in the middle of the night , snap thotos of the majestic animal as spotlights slay on the scene Guests at the Samburu Game Lodge here n northern Kenya were lucky to make the ; fighting . Travelers used to be able to count 3n adding a leopard or two to the list of animals they 've shot  --  with a camera , not a gun ? on safari in East Africa . But the species is dying out in the region , and not just of natural causes . Poaching , the illegal killing of animals for their skins , tusks or other valuable items , is reducing the population of many kinds of big game including leopards elephants , zebras and rhinoceroses . " Leopards come far less often than they did a couple of years ago , " says John Glen , manager of the riverside lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three leopards at one time , he says Now they come singly and only a few nights a week Luxury in the Jungle Animals are Kenya 's major attraction for tourists who bring this developing nation more foreign currency than any of its exports except coffee . In 1974 , tourists spent $65 million here , much of that for luxurious safaris provided by tour operators Visitors are trundled through national parks in seven-seater buses , stopping to photograph animals as they encounter them along dirt paths . Nights are spent in deluxe lodges that serve five-course meals Along with the tourists have come poachers . Africans have been killing animals for food for centuries , of course , but this new wholesale slaughter is aimed at meeting the demands of souvenir-seeking tourists and foreigners who have bid up the price of African relics sharply in recent years . It 's illegal to shoot big game without a hard-to-obtain permit , but you 'd never guess that from seeing the bulging shelves of souvenir shops in Nairobi , Kenya 's modern capital city . Here you can find ivory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a throw and other items from lion-claw jewelry to elephant-hair bracelets . The government is trying to combat poaching , but its resources are limited . More worrisome , some Kenyans believe that while many officials work to curb the illegal killing , other people in high places reap financial gain from the poaching . No Animals , No Tourists The consequences are obvious . " Once the day comes when there are n't any more animals , the tourists wo n't come , " warns Michael J. Sawyer , executive secretary of the East African Wild Life Society , a conservation group that operates in Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania . That could have dire economic consequences The game lodge here , for example . Is just about the only important source of revenue for Samburu county , which owns the lodge and collects about $100,000 annually from its operations . Poaching here is more extensive than in most other parts of the country , officials say . This in part reflects the area 's bad roads and poor communications . Walter Njuguna , warden of Samburu Game Reserve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight main entrances with a staff of just 40 guides , five radios and one Land Rover . Many poachers in these parts are Somalis , a nomadic tribe capable of traveling 50 miles a day on foot . The government men who chase them simply ca n't keep up . " Most of the poachers have a lot of stamina , " confesses Mr. Njuguna . " They have more endurance than my staff . " When the pursuers do catch up , wild shootouts can ensue . Recently , six government game scouts at another reserve , came upon 25 poachers . In a hail of gunfire , a scout sergeant was killed and the poachers got away . A sizable elephant population attracts poachers to Samburu . Bands of men , using the latest automatic weapons and sophisticated poison darts , can slaughter an elephant , strip off its tusks and bury them in little more than an hoiar . Later , after several kills , all the buried tusks are scooped up at one time and loaded onto a large truck . The poachers may only get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the world market . But that $12 is more than a week 's normal wages in an area where there are few jobs to be had anyway . The leaders of the poaching rings are in Nairobi , some 185 miles to the south of here , according to Mannasses Keiller , head of Kenya 's Anti-Poaching Mobile Unit , a fiveyearold body that has more than 50 employes . The bosses operate through middle -- men and rarely have direct contact with the poachers or " their gocids , it is said . " We 've caught almost no big fellows , ' : Mr. Keller says , although his unit has prosecuted more than 600 individuals . Fines for poaching can exceed $12,000 . . ? Mr. Keiller 's headquarters is strategically located in Isiolo , just south of Samburu , in a converted cottage where Joy Ad- amson raised Elsa , the lioness ot " Born Free " fame . But the manpower . transportation and communications facilities of his unit are Inadequate , Mr Kerner adds . Part of the reason the battle against poachers is n't being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing country But there is another reason , one that Kenyans talk about only guardedly That is the alleged involvement in the racket of some of Kenya 's most powerful individuals It has been reported and it 's widely believed in Kenya that Mama Ngina Kenyatta , the attractive young wife of the nation 's much revered 84-year-old president . Jomo Kenyatta , is behind much of what is going on . Although there has n't been any formal proof , one source close to the situation says , " We know what is happening but we keep it to ourselves . Otherwise we could wind up in detention ' ? Foreign residents , who find that Nairobl 's excellent communications and other facilities make it an ideal base for their African business , also are closemouthed about the poaching . " If I were to suggest that people in the president 's family were involved in poaching . I would be thrown out of the country the next day , " says a foreign newsman based in the capital . Some Kenyan othcaals put most of the blame for poaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So long as there is demand , we can do what we like but the problem will continue to be created by people outside this place , " says Daniel &itchy?,; deputy game warden of Kenya 's national parks system There is some good news Officials say that the level of 130. ehtng may have dropped in recent months , although statistics are impossible to come by . The reasons may range from bad publicity over the past abuses to the possibility that Kenya is simply getting poached out , observers say . Mr. Sindiyo says he 's " quite happy " with current developments and notes that authorities recently arrested the assistant police commissioner of Isiolo for transporting illegal ivory . " That 's a very healthy sign , " another official agrees . The government budgeted an increase in funds for anti-poaching activities in the fiscal year that began July 1 and it negotiated a $17 million tourism development loan from the World Bank which included funds for aircraft , trucks and housing for game scouts Kenya also is streamlining its parks administration and has clamped down on private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , once the home of thousands of elephants , only the young and short-tusked remain . " At first I thought it was cute seeing all those young elephants , " says tourist Linda Coy , a nurse from Warwick , England " Then I felt sorry for them , wondering how much longer have they got before they 're big enough to be worth killing " Mrs. Coy 's husband , Michael , says he 'd like to visit Kenya again Then , recalling a professional hunter 's assessment that the country 's big game might be wiped out within a decade , he adds , " But very quickly .
