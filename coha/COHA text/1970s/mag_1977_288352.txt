France 's economy in a race with the left <P> Like most European nations , France is in severe economic trouble . Price increases in 1977 are expected to average just under 10% ; industry is stagnant ; the number of jobless workers has jumped 23% in the past year , to a near record 1,159,000 . What makes France different is that the economy is also in a race of sorts : how much it improves in the next few months-if it does at all-may determine whether a government that includes Communists comes to power as a result of the legislative elections that must be held by next March . True , the Socialist-Communist " union of the left " has been weakened by the inability of the two parties to agree last month on a revision of their joint program . But a poll published last week in the Paris newspaper Le Figaro indicates that the left is still ahead , 50% to 47% . <P> The race is the more nerve-racking because the government has chosen to run it slowly . President Valry Giscard d'Estaing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically inexperienced professor , Raymond Barre , 53 , whom he named both Prime Minister and Finance Minister in August 1976 . The jovial , rotund Barre , who likes to describe himself as " a square man living in a round body , " wrote the textbook used most often in French economics classrooms . Since he moved to his offices at the Hotel Matignon , Barre has applied textbook economics to France 's problems . His austere " Plan Barre , " announced in September of last year , urged business to limit wage hikes to 6.5% a year , v. the 17% annual rate that was handsomely contributing to France 's double-digit inflation . To reduce the country 's costly oil imports , Barre has jacked up the price of " super " gasoline nearly 21% , to $1.85 per gal . He also imposed a three-month price freeze and lowered value-added ( sales ) taxes on a wide range of consumer goods . <P> A year later , Barre 's approach has produced only the most modest successes . The annual rate of inflation in August dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures for September , released last week , showed a slight decline . The nation 's trade deficit will probably be reduced this year to around $3 billion , from $4 billion in 1976 , and the franc has stabilized at about 4.86 to the dollar . On the other hand , output of goods and services is likely to grow only 3% , v. an original forecast from Barre of 4.8% . <P> Nonetheless , Barre is resisting pressure from worried politicians on the right to pump up the economy more before the elections . Last week he presented to the French National Assembly a 1978 budget that provides only a modest $1.8 billion deficit . Says Barre : " We are engaged in a long-term battle . This is not the moment to undo what we have achieved . " He is getting help from a most unexpected source : the labor unions . Though many are led by the Socialists or Communists , the unions have been more docile this year than at any time in recent memory . Reason : they do not want to arouse public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
