Gently but relentlessly , the waves of the Gulf of Mexico pound the powdery white sand of the barrier reef off Texas ' coast . The clear green water , and the silt and sand it has deposited over the centuries , created Padre Island , and have made it an increasingly popular vacation paradise . Yet what the waves have given , they are now taking away . Gently but relentlessly , Padre Island seems to be falling into the sea . <P> Most of the bow-shaped island , stretching 100 miles from the Mexican border to Corpus Christi , is either undeveloped dunes or federally protected national seashore . But at the island 's southern tip is South Padre Island , a town of 700 permanent residents and , on weekends , as many as 50,000 sun seekers . Only 20 miles from Mexico via the causeway to Brownsville , South Padre has a comparable latitude-and , partisans assert , a more congenial climate-than Miami . Says former Mayor John Austin , a retired Marine Corps major and avid fisherman : " I really think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town is alive with the sound of bulldozers , and spanking new condominiums are sprouting like dune grass . Eight buildings with 306 condominium units are under construction , and 116 more units are on the way . " We 're on the grow , " boasts City Manager Kirby Lilljedahl . " We had $8 million in new construction last year , and 1979 could well double that . " <P> Of all South Padre 's assets , the greatest is its beach , wide and powdery , running from the sprouting condominiums to the sea . In Texas , unlike many resort areas , the beaches belong to the people . A person may own land to the water 's edge but may not fence offer build on the beach itself . Virtually everybody in South Padre supports that concept . Says Lilljedahl : " Without these fine beaches for people to use , we 're nothing but a pile of sand . " <P> Along these fine beaches , on a glorious spring weekend with the temperature well over the April average of 74 , there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frisbees , along with the reddening student bodies that came with them . There were young families from Texas and Oklahoma , and from as far away as Colorado . There was the weekly jetload of Canadians brought by Suntours of Toronto . And there was room enough in the sun for them all . <P> But coastal erosion is a national problem ; one-quarter of the nation 's shores are suffering serious erosion , and a number of resort areas , such as Miami Beach , have been ravaged . Padre is no exception . " The shoreline of South Padre Island has been retreating at least since the late 1800s , " wrote University of Texas Geologist Robert Morton in a 1975 report . " At many points , rates of erosion increased between 1960 and 1969 , with parts of the island experiencing extreme erosion . " Separate studies last year by the state 's general land office and researchers at Texas A &; M University confirmed the problem .                   @ @
