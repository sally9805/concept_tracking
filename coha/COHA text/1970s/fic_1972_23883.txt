COPY : a story by Robert Coover BEGUN NINGS N ORDER TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an island and shot himself . His blood . uno able to resist a final joke , splattered the cabin wall in a pattern that read : It is important to begin when everything is already over . This maxim , published on the cabin wall between an outdated calendar and a freshwater fish to eat on and write on at the same time . Then , was a bay out front with a small pier for an boat . He was alone on the island , except for few squirrels , frogs , muskrats , the odd weasel birds , porcupines . The nearest people were abou a mile 's boat ride away . He rarely needed these people , though some chart , would have pleased him . He had once begun a story about the raising of Lazarus , in which Jesus , having had the dead man dragged from the tomb and unwrapped , could n't seem to get the hang of bringing him around . There was an awful stink , the Jews crowding around were getting sick , and Jesus , sweating , was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wo n't be a minute ! If I can just get it started , the rest 'll come easy ! This , then , was his problem : beginning . And having begun : avoiding resolutions . Thus , there were worse jokes his blood might have played on him . Its message might have read : All beginnings imply an apocalypse . Perhaps , in fact , that 's what it did say , how was he to know ? Pulling the trigger , he thought : This is working ! I 'm getting on ! It was comfortable , that cabin , roomy and clean-smelling , with walls of unvarnished Norway pine , Coleman lanterns for light , a wood cookstove , and a long pine table with a yellow checkered oilcloth he 'd bought for it , big enough times he visited them when his imagination faile him or he ran out of peanut butter . On these 0 , casions , they often told him stories , astoundin him with their fear less capacity for denouemen and he 'd return to his island shaken , thinkirq I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him about a man who had come to one of ti islands to write , but on arriving had shot hir self . Yes , he told them , that was me , and du noticed then that his head was coming apat and on the wall was a message : You ai n't set nothin ' yet , friends ! He once wrote a story about a man who w born at the age of thirty-two with a self-dcstru mechanism in his gonads , such that he could I sure of only one orgasm before he died . TI man traveled all over the world , seeking out t. perfect mate for this ultimate experience , blew it one night in a wet dream on a jet flip over Bangkok . What was fascinating about tl story was neither his travels nor his dream , rather the peculiar physical appearance of a m . ept so long in the womb . He had rather liked his story and stayed and stayed with it longer han most . but had had to abandon it finally Then he 'd heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made a start , his blood said on the ' all . Nothing else matters . The people who had ome to identify the body crowded around , star-ig in disbelief . This is impossible , they cried . ' hat story was n't true , it was only a legend ! They oticed that he 'd left the coffeepot on the stove nd it had boiled over . They pointed to it and Ahal  --  satisfying thereby their lust for iotive , but they could n't conceal a certain dis-ppointment . They scratched about , however , nd finally found enough peanut butter for two inclwiches. though there was n't any In ead . Well , t least we have n't come for nothing , they said . p HERE WAS NOTHING PRIMITIVE about this ist land . He had a shallow hay to bathe in , a thin to eat and sleep in , an outhouse to shit in. chair to read in. wild blueberries for breakfast , iws and axes for cutting wood , a boat to go to ? wri in , and he could write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was his , vn fault , because he even had a gas refrigerator id stove . These he used as little as possible , ough , because his principal hardship was ex-ranging used butane tanks for new in town , en single-handedly dragging the loaded one ick to the boat , later heaving it out of the boat id up the steep hill to the cabin , and finally tting it up in place and lighting it without owing himself up . As for the old wood cookstove , he loved it . hen the lake was darkened by a storm , or at ght , he could sit for hours in front of it , watch-g the names , warming himself , brewing coffee , ying up feasts of fish and potatoes when he . d them , imagining a life free of settings forth , so immortal . What limited his use and diinished his enjoyment of the stove was the ed to chop wood for it . There seemed to lurk me kind of unpleasant moral here , and it was is more than the hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have welcomed , it made him use the cookstove less and less . would have abandoned it altogether , but for 4 insomnia . On bad nights , he could stare at flames , each one new , violent , unique , and 3ner or later all this variety would put him to ep . An ordinary island then , with ordinary trees d bushes , ordinary bugs , birds , and reptiles , linary lake water lapping it about , yet even fore pulling the trigger , he recognized that re was something suspicious about it . as rugh it might have been , like the air he , athed , just another metaphor . So many other- ; e solid and habitable islands had gone that way in the past , it was a kind of pollution . Perhaps he should have shot himself in the boat on the way to the island , spared the world another bloody epigram and the island this transgression , this erosion . It was Adam did the naming , why did Eve get all the blame ? Because she was near at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted company . She could n't leave well enough alone , she had to turn up and tax his vocabulary . She must have come there sometime between the pulling of the trigger and the loosing of his blood and brains against the cabin wall . He named her many times over , but never Eve . What could he say in her behalf ? That she helped him drag the butane tanks up the hill . But she helped him use them up faster too . Yet he was grateful , because he was able to throw away everything he had written before she had conic there , and this altered the fuel balance , permitting more fires in the cookstove . Also she was good at finding blueberries and cleaning fish . But she confused him by insisting she had been there first , he was the newcomer to the island , and she lifted her skirts to show him the missing rib . It was at this time that he began to suspect that he , not the island , was the metaphor . He began a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he merely one of the characters , dead before the first paragraph was over . He returned the rib to her and discovered it was more blessed to give than to receive , though this was not accomplished without some bloodletting . They found much peace and pleasure in this sharing of the rib , and called it fucking . Thus , he was still naming things . Perhaps because it rhymed with luck : fucking , they thought , was good for it , good for the raw nerve ends of his navel too . I think this is the beginning of something , he said , as his hips bucked . Though they never let it get in the way of their struggles with one another , it always proved useful whenever they began to repeat themselves . It was almost like a place , somewhere to go when the island and his work became hostile and wounded them , an island within an island . Small wonder , then , that he took to inventing stories in which time had a geography , like an island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view was a kind of punctuation . He assigned numbers and symbols to death , love , characters , unexpected developments , transition ; then submitted them to the rhythms of numerologies . He invented a story with several narrators , each quoting the next , the last quoting the first and telling the story being told . He began another , added footnotes , subfootnotes to the footnotes , further footnotes to the subfootnotes , and so on to exhaustion , which came early ; he still had something to learn about pacing himself . The woman . like all women no doubt , was always the same woman and never the same woman twice . Sometimes she was pregnant , sometimes she was not . Sometimes she soaped him up when they bathed in the bay , and then they lucked in the water , or else on the shore , under the trees , in the cabin , out in the woodpile , less often when she was pregnant . She did her best to hide the children from him for fear he 'd eat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He was always sorry about it afterwards , because he missed them and they gave him constipation for a week . In which case she cared for him , scratched his head , gave him enemas , strewed the path to the outhouse with rose petals . T HE OUTHOUSE WAS A SHORT WALK away from the cabin , up a path made cushiony by deac pine needles , hidden from the cabin by the thiel , forest of pines , poplars , birch , and dogwood . I was strictly for shitting or thinking , since it wa : their habit to piss wherever they were when tin need hit them , except inside the cabin . Some times , at night , simply out the front door int ( the moonlight , hoping not to get hit by mos quitoes . Hoping did little good , they got bi anyway . This added purpose and energy to thei : fucking , but did little to improve their technique It was like the sting of conscience , teaching then to murder or be damned . The children were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin often smellei worse than the outhouse . On such days , he woub take the boat out on the lake and fish for wall eyes and bass , pretending to be the Good Pre vider . He was not lucky at it , though . and hate taking the hook out , so sooner or later he 'd g on into town and buy fish at the store . Th woman was always amazed at his luck in catel ing filleted fish . It 's a parable , he explained , an put the gun to his head . Soon I 'll be able to di : pense with this gun altogether , he thought wit his scattering brain . It 's like taking a catharti ( Sometimes he thought that might be the wa to get started at last : with a cathartic . But what the trouble was heartburn ? For it was true , hi writing was a rice and tended to alienate then He found he did no writing at all while fucking and vice versa . It could be even worse inbetweet times , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing . He ate better than when lived alone , slept better , she even took to ehol ping the wood and dragging the butane tang up by herself , he had all the time in the worlt and yet if anything he was writing less . He use to spill beer , ashes , peanut butter , kerosene ini his typewriter , and hardly noticed : now she keg it clean for him , and it kept breaking dowi Whenever an idea really gripped him , she wou ' cry and accuse him of leaving the island ; he apologize and take her for a ride in the boa wondering where it was he 'd been . She diaper ( the children in the climaxes of his stories , doir him a service , but she also borrowed his typir ribbon for a clothesline and mistook his story f a grocery list , nearly poisoning them all . And yet , she was indispensable . When he cot plained about the suffering of the artist , sl added more fruit to his diet , and in truth I suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ti cookstove and listen to the stillness beyond ti flames ; now there was her breathing . And wl else was there to read to ? He realized he h. been writing so as to be able to sleep at nigl but she could purge his guilt with a simple bat . rub , confirming his suspicion that it was nothi more than a cramp in the lumbar region . Wh he reasoned that perhaps he needed the writir fter all , to stay awake in the daytime , she sent he children in to play with him . He began a iarody on Plato 's cave parable , in which he celeprated not the shadows but the generosity of the /all . Also , it became important to delay the climax . ' hus , he got involved with spirals , revolutions , erb tenses , and game theory . There were puns : tat could make endings almost impossible , like crtain very thick prophylactic devices . He tarted a story about a man who was granted a ' ish by a good fairy and kept wishing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide ullet , and kept it up all night . He invented a . ory about Noah in which the old man starts y making the door and the window , then ca n't gure out how to build the ark around them . God , ffi , is confused by this approach , but is too roud of his storied omniscience to admit it . and ) provides dogmatic solutions that turn out to e self-contradictory . Many volumes of profound - guments ensue . Noah builds himself a cap-tin 's bridge meanwhile . but God , annoyed by s pretensions , turns Noah into a pillar of salt . od instructs Noah on the laying of the keel , at Noah misunderstands the symbology , and msequently his keel has fourteen stems , but no ern . Enough of these false starts , he reasoned , king his children down to the bay for an after-um swim , and the flood will never come . It was beautiful , that little bay , clean and iiet , cool , with only the occasional leech like a utionary tale . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman would Neel on a flat rock at the lip of the bay like iyche , washing out diapers . On sunny days , hools of tiny fish would arrive like visitors am the city , white and nervous , and birds would me down , looking for action . His children lashed at the edges , played in the sand , scram- ? r1 about in the boat , chased toads , cried when ey got ants on them , peed on the bluebells and ch other , ate mud . Now and then , one would own or get carried off by the crabs . and he 'd inder : why do we go on making them if they 're 3 t going to quit on us ? Neither the woman nor balls ever seemed to ask that question , and felt alienated . He contemplated a detective try , in which all the victims and suspects are irdered , as well as the detective and all those .0 come to investigate the murders of the tectives who came before . But he was an innsigent realist. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pier , that he 'd probably bog down the research . He dove off , projecting out a midolume work to he entitled , Adventures 01 a mgaloid Idiot , and struck his head on the botn , thinking : all this from the pulling of one ; ger ! Re message on the bloodspattcred wall was a rued discourse on the forty-seventh chromone of mongoloid idiots , and its influence on the prime number theorem of imminent apocalypse . Was it enough to say that he 'd shot himself because he 'd let the coffee boil ? Probably it was enough . He 'd apparently run out of bread and had been eating his peanut butter between manuscript pages . His typing ribbon was missing . First lines lay scattered like crumbs , and ants were carrying them off . One of them read : In eternity , beginning is consummation . M UCH OF THE ISLAND WAS UNVISITED , being too thickly overgrown with trees and brambles . You could sink up to your knees in pulp from the last era 's forest . His children occasionally wandered off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . for they 'd have heard them snorting and farting on still nights . Sometimes they took the boat around the shore of the island , gathering bleached driftwood . One of these twisted shapes led him to a story about a monster that was devouring the earth in bits and drabs , but he threw it away , recognizing it as genteel autobiography . On one corner of the island , amid tall reeds , herons nested . If my head was on a neck like that , he thought , I might not have to shoot it off . The cabin itself sat in a small sunny clearing above the little bay , with a view out over the lake and other islands . Now and then , a boat passed distantly , put-putting along . He wondered about the people who used to tell him stories . They probably died when the bombs fell . Some politician did it one morning in a fit of pique or boredom , blew the whole thing up . The earth was never revisited . In time , the sun burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a meteor disintegrating gradually in its fierce passage through eons . Nothing was ever known of man . He may as well have never existed . He liked to sit in a chair in front of the cabin in the warm sunshine , gazing out over the blue lake , contemplating the final devastation , and thinking : all right , what next ? He could just imagine that politician , the last giant of his race , pushing the button and thinking : this is one day they wo n't soon forget . He sat in the chair less often when the woman was on the island , for he seemed then to attract chores and children like flies . At such times , he would go up and sit among the spiders in the outhouse , contemplating his aesthetic , which seemed to have something to do with molten flats , hyperbole , and scarecrows . He wanted to write about Job 's last years , after he 'd got his wealth back . He thought : the central theme should be stated in the title and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'd been in a foxhole for fifty years and who , having forgotten entirely who the enemy was or what his rifle was for , crawled out one day and got shot . He could call it : " Beginnings . " He planned
