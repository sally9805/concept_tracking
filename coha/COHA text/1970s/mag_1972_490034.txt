THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment p RESIDENT NIXON , in a campaign speech , has urged his countrymen . " Never send the President of the United States to the conference table with anybody as head of the second-strongest nation in the world . " This is familiar and resounding stuff  --  a new verse in the President 's " No. 1 Na  --  tion " anthem , and nearly guaranteed to raise a shout of pride or a thought  --  ful nod of assent right across the plains of the national consciousness . It is a plea that seems absolutely irresist  --  ible , in fact , up to the moment when somebody murmurs " A1 ) not ? " ? at which point , of course , the whole thing suddenly disappears , like those trick dollar bills that flash away to nothing when a match is touched to them . The conference in Mr. Nixon 's speech is not specified , but since our President is to be there , one must imagine that it is a heavy one , likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whale . The assumption must he that it is to be a summit and that nothing but a most significant issue  --  disarmament or putting an end to a long war  --  is to he discussed . What the President is telling us , then , is that we may undertake such negotiations only from a position of clear military and strategic and economic superiority  --  that if we were the second-strongest nation in the world ( or the third , or the seventh ) in any of these areas , we would have nothing to gain from such a conference , and a great deal to fear ; bul  --  lied or outflanked , we would have to accede to some unacceptable or unspeakable compro  --  mise . This compromise is also indescribable , because it is utterly un  --  real . The one inescap  --  able truth of this nu  --  clear age  --  and , indeed , the one radical alteration in interna  --  tional affairs in this century  --  is that primacy means very little among na  --  tions that possess the power to blow each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is understood , it becomes apparent that nobody can he permitted to be in first place ; we arc all wholly endangered , wholly the victims of our armaments and their enormous financial and psy  --  chological costs , and thus all equal in our anxiety and vulnerability . That re  --  alization  --  the precise opposite of what the President has been urging upon us  --  also constitutes the only hope for an alternative to this deadly state of affairs . Hopelessly and perpetually equal , we are free to undertake the enormously difficult job of disarming ourselves voluntarily . Once we admit that we are not the No . I Nation  --  since no country that is not truly de  --  luded can make that claim now  --  we can agree with other nations to begin taking apart this formidable and ghast  --  ly apparatus , so that we diminish our  --  selves together and thus attain the status of communities rather than pow  --  ers , of peoples rather than frightening and frightened bullies . None of this is new , of course . For twenty years now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so difficult to crack these plain truths that they have learned to combat them with something like a new art form  --  the periodic scaring-to-death of Con ? congress , precisely at appropriation time , with the image of some impending enemy nuclear artifact or strategy that will utterly distort the existing stale  --  mate and can be neutralized only by the expenditure of more billions of dol  --  lars . It seems important , though , to wonder why President Nixon gives such urgency to his No. 1 Nation idea . Certainly it is an ancient and useful political cliche  --  a phrase , always good for a big hand , that promises much and means almost nothing . Mr. Nixon , a consummate politician , is a master of such devices . Yet  --  curiously , inescap  --  ably  --  it appears that he means it . In his conduct of the war , in his re  --  peatedly voiced fears of an American " humiliation " in Southeast Asia , in his continuous raining down of nearly anonymous and nearly impersonal death on the land and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different civilization from our own , in his clinging to the symbols and prejudices of that war in preference to facing its hitter realities and diffi  --  cult lessons , in the deviousness and plain dishonesty of his Administration 's conduct of that war  --  in all this , he suggests a man who believes to his core in the concept of a No . I Nation . In the end , nations can understand themselves only if they are to some degree personified ; we must judge our selves as a country in the same way we judge ourselves , privately and cease lessly , as human beings . If we have indeed become No. 1 and intend to remain No. 1 , what will it do to us ? How will we live with ourselves ? Who in the world , we wonder , could feel at home with a per son who came to the breakfast table each morning intent on be ing No. 1 in his family , No. 1 in his day ? Would anyone trust a man so driven and disliked ? And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 continue to trust himself ? Alone as he would he , quite cut off from the modest concerns and the pains and difficulties of each new day that were shared by the rest of the family , how long would it he before he wondered whether he had not become deranged and truly dangerous ? ? CLEARLY , while fainthearts and parlor liberals were lamenting that our nation was standing still , or , worse , becoming lazy , dreary , dusty , behind the times ( " Look who invented the Wankel engine , " scoffed the faint-hearts ; " Look who won the hundred-metre clash at Munich ! " sneered the parlor liberals ) ? all the while , our Ad  --  ministiation was preparing us for a Great Leap Forward . It has happened , and , since there is no official name for it , we will now coin one ; the Decline and Disappearance and Extinction of Political Scandal As We Have Known It is what comes to mind . Think of it : No longer does a weary nation have to listen to baseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No more do toiling field hands and football players have to raise their weary heads to listen to yap and yawkle about , say , a Rus  --  sian wheat dual or some campaign-fund fudging . Did the nation benefit in any way from editors ' and reporters ' spreading their filthy cambric about I.T . &; T. across the nation 's papers , interfering with the stock quotations and placing a weight on the heavy heart of the householder ? Certainly not . Who cares about General Lavelle ? Or Maurice Stans ? Or Bobby Baker ? Or Sherman Adams ' rug ? The grand busi  --  ness of the nation rolls forward -- -also meat and milk prices  --  except , of course , for that dangerous fellow Sena  --  tor MeWh a t's-H is-Name , who appar  --  ently wants to sell the furniture in the Pentagon to the Arabs and turn us into some kind of weird ninth-rate power . Harold Geneen ? Never heard of him . Did General Lavelle drop too many vicufia coats on those people up there in that **26;4221;TOOLONG town of theirs ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of our Im  --  perial Guard , said of him the other day . Retiring the had apple on full pension seemed " adequate punishment , " added the chairman . Well , there you have it . All those years of listening to unreliable Mediterranean poets going on about oar Puritanism , our " punitive tendencies , " guilt , retribution , the Dark Conscience of New England , and so forth . Clear ? ly , we are beyond all that now . Besides , the football season is upon us . The President will doubtless throw out the first ball . Oh , Charles Van Doren , where are you now ? W omen Writers AMERICAN women , so much in the news as an entity today , are at  --  tractively and independently repre  --  sented in the Barnard College library as writers , thanks to a bequest of Bertha Van Riper Overhury , Barnard 1896 , of some nineteen hundred hooks by them  --  ranging from a 1758 Boston edition of verse by Anne Bradstreet ( she died in 1672 ; the first edition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fannie Hurst , Eudora Welty , Katherine Anne Porter , and Cornelia Otis Skinner  --  and nearly a thousand related manuscripts . We re  --  cently visited the collection , which con  --  tains great runs of Louisa M. Alcoa and Harriet Beecher Stowe , along with such arresting titles as " The Belle , the Blue , and the Bigot ; or , Three Fields for Woman 's Influence , " " Haunted Hearts , " and " Fern Leaves from Fan  --  ny 's Port-folio . " All this is housed in an enclave presided over by Patricia K. Ballou , who let us examine , among other early items , an 1805 three-vol  --  ume " History of the Rise , Progress and Termination of the American Revolution , " by Mercy Otis Warren , and " Poems on Various Subjects , Re  --  ligious and Moral , by Phillis Wheatley , Negro Servant to Mr. John Wheatley , of Boston , in New England " ( London , /773 ) .

We jotted down a few passages from manuscript letters . Abigail Adams to her sixteen-year  --  old granddaughter : I have written this to you a letter about some of her forebears because it is a subject which young people scarcely ever think of but as they advance in years they become more inquisitive about their ancestors . As this country was settled by a religious and learned people although somewhat bigoted we can trace our an  --  cestors much easier than those people who are settled by conquest  --  and we can trace them to pure unadulterated English blood .

I suppose none can enter fully into these feelings , can per  --  fectly know how " very good " is this " nen , creation " without being really a parent , but I have loved one little boy so long and so well , that I have some idea of what that second life may be . He is dead now and though it is some time since he left us , my thoughts still rest on the re  --  membrance of his looks and words and little ways that seem fraught with such a world of meaning , as they do on nothing else , and I often wonder that the sun can shine upon his grave . I am glad that yours are boys ; men are much wanted in this country and till there have been some nobler men , women can not have so fair a chance as I wish them . Willa Cather to Chilson H.

Who was Bertha Overhury ? She was burn in Jersey City in 1873 ; she lived to be ninety ; her husband , who predeceased her by many years , was a manufacturer of asphalt roofing ; they had no children ; she lived in San Ma  --  rino , California , a few blocks from the Huntington Library , where she spent much of her time reading . As a collec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and men , but in the late thir ties she settled down to a specialty , which she called American Women Authors . The library has one of her works . " I have a house-keeper who does the mar  --  keting , is an excellent cook , and is also my chauffeur , " she wrote in replying to a biographical questionnaire distrib uted to Barnard College when she was eighty-three . " NVe have no hours . She has one of my cars and comes and goes at any time during the day or night . No restrictions . Also I have boys from the Fuller Theological Seminary to clean windows , wax and polish floors , and do the vacuum cleaning . They arc glad to have the work . " Museum Reports DISAPPEARING WILDLIFE : The American Museum of Natural History 's exhibit called " Never Say Die " is about five North American ani  --  mals threatened with extinction  --  Abe alligator , the timber wolf , the Atlantic salmon , the peregrine falcon , and the black-footed ferret . " We had , natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ing-wildlife show , " Kenneth A. Cham  --  bers , senior instructor in the Museum 's Education Department , which ar  --  ranged the exhibit , told us at a preview that included sherry , Dubonnet , pret  --  zels , and Mrs. John V. Lindsay . " One reason we picked these five is that each is in danger for a different reason . The timber wolf has been overhunted ; the alligator has suffered from drainage of its habitat ; the peregrine falcon has been poisoned by pesticides , causing it to produce eggs with shells so thin they break during incubation ; the salmon has been deprived of a healthy environ  --  ment by pollution and the destruction of breeding areas by forest clear-cutting and river dams ; and the ferret has been deprived of its primary food animal . " " You mean the prairie dog ? " we asked . " Yes , " Mr. Chambers said . " The prairie dog has been systematically poi  --  soned , because it competes with cattle for grass . There used to be millions of prairie dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menace . " " I do n't think I ever knew about the black-footed ferret , " Mrs. Lindsay said . " The peregrine falcon is my favorite herd , " Gardner Stout , the Museum 's president , remarked to us . We asked him why . " I lice the great killers , " he said . " It 's aerodynamically very efficient . It can fly ninety to a hundred miles an hour . " The five endangered species were represented by mounted specimens of the alligator and the falcon , and by a dozen or more photographs . There was also a wolfskin , mounted under glass but with a middle section in the clear , an that it could be touched . " I suppose it 'll be worn to a frazzle  --  someone was nuzzling it with his nose a few minutes ago  --  but we wanted to get away from the hands-off thing of most exhibits , " Dr. Malcolm Arth , chairman of the Education Department , said . " This is a message exhibit rather than a stud exhibit . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've tried to aim them at persons with absolutely no scientific background . " We copied down one about the timber wolf : This great wild dog is trapped , poi  --  soned , and shot from aircraft . Contrary to popular belief , in North America it has never been known to attack man , and plays an invaluable role in feeding upon sick , weak , or injured caribou and other animals . Thus , only strong , healthy individuals survive to breed and perpetu  --  ate the species . The outlook is dim for the timber wolf . But never say die : This species can still be saved if we act quick ly , through education , to change its un  --  deserved public image . Dr. Arth offered us a pre-preview of a new Museum fixture , the People Center , which his department is about to open , and we followed him upstairs to an area that will be devoted to what might he called participatory anthro  --  pology . It consists of an exhibit gallery , two teaching pits ( small enclosures with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center 's walls are curved , though the Museum is generally . recti  --  linear . " We 'll have East Indian clas  --  sical-dance demonstrations , and African robes that visitors can try on , " Dr. A. said . " We 'll have discussions of the arts of hairdressing and turban-tying by two women who will demonstrate on volunteers . We may have native foods to be sampled . " The theatre has plum-colored walls , a purple-blue carpet , and yellow chairs ; the pits are a cheerful burnt orange ; Dr. Arth has an orange beard . " We expect to recruit a new audience by offering them the performing arts , " he said " We wo n't have to fight to get a Spanish-speaking audience , or blacks from Harlem . " Dr. Arth , who is forty-one , is an anthropologist ; the People Center was his idea . He came to the Museum two years ago , on leave from Ade1phi Col  --  lege , where he was chairman of the Anthropology Department . " I 've just resigned my tenure to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in the field in Nigeria last winter , in a village called /keagwu . The word means ' We are tired , ' but I 'm not . You never get tired of anthropology . Nothing that has to do with man is outside its province . " PRESIDENTIAL DEDICATION : A proud father we know has shared with us the following essay : " St. T ? ' s Academy . " Civics II-13 . " Our Class Trip : A Composition . " Last week , our class went to the Statue of Liberty to see President Nix  --  on dedicate the American Museum of Immigration . The day before we went , Sister told us that we had to wear our green flannel blazers and white blouses , because a lot of schoolchildren were going to he there and she wanted St. T ? ' s Academy to stand nut . The dedication  --  or , at any rate , the part that we saw  --  took place on the grassy mall at the foot of the Statue . We cer  --  tainly ? stood out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish-American girls in krako  --  wianki and Hungarian-Americans in kalotaszegi and dozens of little boys in yarmulkes . There were also Italian-Americans and German-Americans in native costumes , but Sister did n't know the names for them . President Nixon is n't Catholic or Jewish , Sister said , but he is n't prejudiced against Catholics or Jews , so he invited a lot of them to the dedication . Vs'c certainly made a color  --  ful sight , sitting and standing in the sunshine with Miss Liberty above us . The only had thing in the sight was an absolutely enormous clump of movie cameras , which was opposite the speak  --  ers ' dais , but Sister said we could n't very well have the dedication without those cameras and their crews . Be  --  sides , she said , if we were lucky we might he able to spot Catherine Mackin , of N.B.C . " Tn get to the dedication , we had to he on time to catch a Circle Line boat at Battery Park . Sister said that the Committee to Re-elect the President had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Liberty Island , though , we learned that the President himself was a little late . We all had to wait in the sun and listen to the Twenty-sixth Army Band , from Fort Wadsworth , play ' Be Kind to Your Web-Footed Friends ' and other songs . The band leader , by the way , was practically the only African-American on the mall , though most other immigrant groups were well represented . He was wear  --  ing a headset like a telephone oper  --  ator 's , which Sister said he needed so he would know when to play ' Hail to the Chief . ' We listened to his music , and we also heard Henri Chuidel , the Con  --  sul-General of France , say a few words about the Statue , which his countrymen gave to America . A monsignor read an invocation . Once in a while , a helicopter flew past , and some of us screamed , be  --  cause we thought the President was in it . He was supposed to be coming from Newark Airport . Finally , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people stood on chairs to get a glimpse of him . I got up on my chair , but I could n't see a thing , because the helicopter was behind a hedge . Sister said that the President was going to visit the Museum , which is in the base of the Statue , so we had to wait some more , but after a few minutes he came out of the Museum 's doors . He was with Pat , his wife , and Secretary of the Interior Rogers Mor  --  ton , and Pierre S. du Pont , the presi  --  dent of the Museum . I was hoping to see Eddie Cox and Tricia , but they were n't there . " There was a lovely artificial-grass carpet running through the crowd , on top of the real grass , and President Nixon walked down this carpet to the dais . He shook some people 's hands and n ea rly  --  j ust nccrly  --  shank mine . ( Sigh . ) On the dais , he waved to us and shook hands with Governor Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other dignitaries present . Then he sat down and crossed his legs , and I mist say he looked even better than on television . He was wearing a gray suit , and his hair was neatly groomed , and he had a happy smile on his face . Secretary Morton stood at the lectern and spoke first . He be  --  gan by paying tribute to Mrs. Nixon , and said that the last time they had been on a platform together there had been a hailstorm and a rainstorm and a snowstorm . That sounded like an awful lot of weather to me , but he did n't explain . Then lie introduced THE NEW YORKER the President , arid I could n't hear a thing , because everyone was cheering . " The President waved , and when ev  --  eryone quieted down he began his speech . He had hardly said a word when all of a sudden a few people I had n't even noticed them  --  began shouting ' Stop the bombing ! Stop the bombing ! ' There were about half a dozen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thee had barely shouted it twice when it lot of people began chanting Four more years ! Four more years ! ' to drown them MIL Sister said that the people who wanted the bomb  --  ing to end were heck  --  lers . How they had got there was anybody 's guess , because they cer  --  tainly were n't invited . One of them held up a sign reading I WANT TO MAKE ONE LH NG PERFECTLY CLEAR ' and showing a Viet  --  namese woman with a gun at her head . A man snatched it out of the heckler 's hands , and Sister said it was a pretty tasteless sign to hold up when the Pres  --  ident of the United States was trying to make a speech about immigration . A few of the heck  --  lers were taken away , but the others stayed on and continued to shout at the President . Sister said that this was an example of free speech  --  the heck  --  lers ' free speech , I think she meant . As for me , I was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It all sounded very patriotic , though just like our history hook . He only spoke a few minutes . At the end , I remember , he said , ' I urge all of you to spend the time that we do not have to see this museum . ' Then a rabbi gave the benediction , and the President waved some more . Before be left the dais , he asked some girls from St. Mi  --  chael 's Academy to come up and have their pictures taken with him . They were screaming and jumping , they were so happy . " Well , the President and Mrs. Nixon took off in their helicopter , and after a while we were allowed into the Museum . Sister said that the - American government had spent five million dol  --  lars to have it constructed , and were n't we lucky it opened in September ? There was a very nice lobby , air-con  --  ditioned , and then we climbed sonic stairs to reach the exhibits . The ex  --  hibits were in a series of little rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out where we had started . Most of the exhibits were big pictures with little captions , and they told the story of American immigration from be  --  ginning to end . The first caption said , Twenty thousand years before Euro  --  peans crossed the Atlantic , Indians im  --  migrated from Asia . ' Next to this was a picture of Indians growing corn and tending their huts . There were also sonic models and movies . One room contained twelve little dummies dressed up as Revolutionary War soldiers , and they could talk like dolls . When I Came into the room , one of them was saying , My name is Christian Febiger . I was horn in Denmark , in 1746 . At the dine of the Battle of Lexington , I was in the West Indies . I hastened forthwith to Boston to begin my military career as a foreign volunteer in the pursuit of the American independence . First a foot soldier ... ' And so on . It 's a nice new museum , and I enjoyed it very much . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One the other way , because the sun was setting and we could see the commuters going home to Staten Island . Sister said that if we lived to have grandchildren we could tell them of the time we saw the President , and I 'm certainly glad I 've got this composition to remind me of what it was all about . "
