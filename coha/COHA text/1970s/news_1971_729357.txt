txt Premier Chou En-lai surprised the United States table tennis team today with his sharp wit , relaxed air and interest in the hippie movement . Since most of us had only the vaguest prior image of Mr. Chou , and none of us had any background in Chinese affairs , we were pretty nervous and more than a little tense when we arrived at the enormous Great Hall of the People ? it 's easily four city blocks long . The band of newsmen who were accompanying us underscored the " historical significance " of the day , but most of us were probably thinking what we 'd say to the Chinese leader and incredibly curious about what he 'd be like . The only one In the group who seemed undaunted by the afternoon was our " team hippie , " Glenn Cowan of Santa Monica College , whose long hair and style of dress have attracted attention everywhere we 've been , since everyone seems to dress the same here . The rest of us were dressed conservatively , ties and jackets , but 19-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers received by Mr. Chou . The 73-year-old Premier , in the traditional gray , buttoned-to-the-top jacket , greeted each team individually , shaking every member 's hand , going alphabetically : Canadian , Colombian , English , Nigerians , and finally the United States . Before going into the reception hall , we were taken on a tour of part of the building . Each city or province seemed to have its own room , with suitable paintings , tapestries , rugs . There were pictures of Mao Tse-tung in many places , or symbolic representations of him , like the // sun . One of the New Yorkers ' said the building reminded her of the Metropolitan Museum of Art . One of the ? girls on the team complaieed  --  one of the few complaints ? that she 'd rather visit places ordinary Chinese live in than what she termed these " palaces . " When we were taken into the room to meet Mr. Chou , we , were placed in a circle , sitting at little desks , together with the members of the other teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of understatement to show he had a good sense of humor , and ? seemed to be enjoying himself . .. Question for Leader He asked Graham Steenhoven , the president of the United States Table Tennis ' Association , if any of the team had ever been in China before . Mr. Steenhoven said , " Well , no ; none of us arefamiliar with China , but we have become familiar with Chinese hospitality . " Mr. Steenhoven did n't add that the trip to China was so sudden that we did n't even have a guidebook with us ; probably no group of American " tourists " has ever been so ill-prepared . Mr. Chou said that there was an old Chinese saying , " What joy it is to bring friends from afar . " Mr. Steenhoven replied , " Good friends can be found anywhere and we , wel'come the Chinese i the United States . " " In the past , " Mr. , Chou said , with the newsmen scribbling his words on their pads , " a lot of American friends have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bringing more friends . " The emphasis was on " start , " and it seemed as if he were saying , that the doors would be open to other Americans . Mr. Steenhoven then said : " Many Americans would welcome the chance to come to China . And we hope many Chinese will ' come to America soon . " The conversation then turned inevitably to Chinese food , and we made the polite , mock complaint About being overfed . There was an embarrassed silence as Mr. Chou asked for questions , and I decided to tell him that I thought a painting based on Mao 's poem , " Ode to Snow , " which I had seen while walking up a marble staircase , made me feel as if I were walking into a " heaven of poetry . " A Trace of Dissatisfaction Mr. Chou said " I think you overpraise it " ? either out of modesty or more knowledge of art than I have . Glenn Cowan , our hippie , made the mistake of addressing him as " Mr. Chairman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He asked what lie thought of the hippie movement in the United States  --  a ' question that was completely unexpected and seemed to catch not only Mr. Chou off I guard , but also the rest of the Americans . But Mr. Chou decided to discuss the subject . He said that he was " not very clear about it " and could give only some superficial ideas . " Perhaps youth is dissatisfied with-the present situation , " he said . " Youth wants to seek the truth and out of this search , various forms of change are bound to come forth . Thus , this is a kind of transitional period . Youth goes through various practices and different things . Practice is very important because theory without practice is useless . And there are different kinds of ideology . " " When we were young , " he continued , , " it was the same , too . " He then noted young Cowan 's long hair and seemed amused by , it , and said that the English and Japanese youth also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we inferred that he would n't recommend it to his youth . , Glenn continued the conversation by saying that he thought that youth should be judged by what they think and not by appearance . " We agree that young people should try different things , but we should try to find something in common with the great majority , " Mr. Chou said in what seemed a polite pitch for the world 's short-haired . The conversation was getting a bit too serious , it seemed , and Mr. Chou had spent more Mime talking to Glenn than to any other single player in the room , but he could n't conclude without saying something about table tennis . He said to Glenn , " I 'm sure you played not badly . " " Well , I could have been better , " he replied .
