AS I WRITE THIS ( early February ) , ) , Washington is in a mood even more surly than has been customary for the past few years . Candidates , managers , media people , reformers , party officials ? all are busy comparing notes and conspiring to get around the Supreme Court 's decision on the Campaign Financing Act . It is difficult fur them to know what to do , since the Justices clearly did n't know , either , and reading their opinions is of little use in trying to understand what they said . The decision , with all of its labored explanations , concurrences , dissents , concurrences in part , and dissents in part , stands as one of the longest ( more than 150 pages ) in Supreme Court history , and , like most long and complex decisions , pleases almost no one . As things stand now , without any remedial legislation and with none in sight , everyone is unhappy . The reformers are in disarray ( Common Cause 's John Gardner 's elation the first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the old ways of polities " turned out to be unwarranted ) , the candidates are confused as to where , how much , and from whom with its accompanying feeling of dread that now somebody must talk to him , perhaps to explain why he could not run the whole campaign . And I have been reliably informed by those in other campaigns ? including Republican ones ? that they shared the same relieved feeling ; there would be no more big givers , since contributions had been limited to $1,000 . At that level of giving , the conversation could be short : " Are you sending the grand ? Thanks . " But the new decision has put all that in doubt . Here , briefly , is what the Court did : ( 1 ) It retained the principle of federal financing , out of tax contributions ( the $1 box on your return ) , for Presidential races only . This means that candidates fur President can get so-called matching funds from the federal treasury , a dollar for each dollar raised privately ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total level of spending of $10 million in the prenornination period , and $20 million thereafter . It also provides large sums of tax money forthe two national parties to defray convention expenses ? up to $2 million each , with no requirement for matching funds . However : ( 2 ) The Court struck down the mechanism for distributing those funds , the Federal Election Commission , on the ground that it had been created in a patently unconstitutional way . Some of its members had been appointed by Congress , and one branch of government ( legislative ) may not perform the functions of another ( executive ) ; the commission had been charged with enforcing the law . There is some support to reconstitute the commission , allowing the President to appoint the members , but there is also a lot of sympathy in Congress to let it die , since many House members detected a willingness on the part of the commission to look into how they financed their campaigns . If the commission is abolished , then the clerks of Congress and the Congressionally appointed Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act , and no one doubts that they would be understanding . ( 3 ) The Court summarily dismissed , in a bit of circular reasoning that will delight the legal scholars for generations to come , the claims of third parties on the public purse , on the premise that they have never ( well , hardly ever ) been successful . The Court has now made sure they never will again . If third-party candidates get a relatively high percentage of the vote , they can qualify for matching funds after the election . lint , of course , if that happens it will only constitute proof that they had n't needed the money , anyway . ( 4 ) The limit of $1,000 was kept on contributions by any individual . However : ( 5 ) The limit was removed on contributions by any individual " in behalf of " a candidate , so long as they are not directly contributed to the campaign fund , and so long as there has been no " collusion " between the contributor and the candidate . ( 6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend of his own money for his own campaign . ( This portion of the opinion will become known as the Rockefeller Revivification Act of 1976 ) . ( 7 ) Limits were also removed from the amount which can be spent in a campaign overall ; if , however , a candidate takes the federal matching money , he must accept the spending limits as well . This has the effect of licensing unlimited spending for every other race than the one for President , and can be called the Rich Congressman 's Entitlement Act . N ow , CLEARLY , it is paragraph five which is causing most of the trouble and apprehension . The party leaders will see to it that some compromise is arrived at which will keep the tax money flowing , and nobody , except some staunch reformers , cares very much about the commission . And nobody whose voice is heard very loudly cares about third parties ? that 's why they 're third . But if paragraph five means what people are coming to think it means , then the lid is off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a level with , let us say , party platforms . What the Court seemed to be saying was that a fat cat can give money in any amount to support a candidate , for any purpose , so long as it is n't an " official " one . It is n't hard to imagine how this might go . " Stewart ( or Max , or Clement ) , the candidate sure would like to present his views in radio spots , hut , gosh darn it , we just do n't have the money . If we had , we 'd send it to the leading station in each of the major markets in California ( or Florida , or Illinois , or Texas ) , and the whole thing would only conic to $3 million . Maybe you and some of your friends interested in robust , untrammeled public discussion share our views . " And , bear in mind , there will almost certainly be no commission , or any other group , with the power or the interest to determine if this sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it 's going to go ( and there is no one in this city prepared to say it is not ) , then we are hack at square one , back to the kind of polities where money speaks louder than votes where the rich have more of a say than anyone else . Worse , back to the days when somebody has to listen to them .
