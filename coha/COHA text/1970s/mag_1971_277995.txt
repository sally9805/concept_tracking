The past six months have seen some of the highest prices ever paid for works of art . From this ebullience one might deduce a healthy art market . In fact , the market is utterly schizophrenic . Living artists and their dealers are the casualties ; dead artists and auction houses have been the beneficiaries . <P> The recession in America has been hardest on those serious painters whose work has not yet entered the $20,000-minimum empyrean where the De Koonings , Motherwells and Stellas reside . In bad times , there is almost no free money to buy anything but sure bets . And , since the collecting of art has largely surrendered to the principles of investment and tax deduction , the question of what is or is not a sure bet has acquired a nervous obsessiveness . <P> So where have all the dollars gone ? They have fled to the august past . It is apparently easier to sell a painting for $250,000 than for $2,500 . But what would the vitriolic old curmudgeon Edgar Degas-who prophetically remarked that there are some kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his pastels at Parke-Bernet last May ? How would the impoverished Van Gogh have greeted the news that 80 years after his death his later oils would routinely go for anything between $250,000 and $1,000,000 to exactly the same sort of people who , when he lived , bought Meissoniers ? <P> In the auction house , amid the deep carpets and the reverent murmur of bids , such prices are made to look like a belated homage to genius . In fact they are nothing of the kind . They represent a crass transformation of aesthetic experience into commodity . They stem from two iron rules of the market : 1 ) that as money devalues , it seeks to embody itself in commodities that seem more stable than bank notes or stock ; 2 ) that a painting or sculpture has no " real " value at all . It is worth what some collector can be induced to pay for it , not a cent more or less . <P> Tourist Object . This might seem harmless enough . But inflated prices feed a numbness back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been big news for so long now that nobody can look at a Monet without seeing in front of that exquisite paint a wall of dollar signs . The hedge against inflation inevitably becomes a hedge against perception . Its price has made the painting different , of an order other than art . Museums , which should resist this syndrome , tend to exploit it . Thus the Metropolitan got untold mileage out of the fact that it paid $5,544,000 for its new Velsquez , which therefore became more " interesting " than other and greater paintings in its collection . The picture becomes a tourist object to be gawked at rather than an experience to be enjoyed in all its complexity .
