THN NEW F NO MAN CEWELL This is a Norman Rockwell year . A retrospective exhibit of his paintings , built around his Saturday Evening Post covers , is touring the country from coast to coast . There are nine stops in all , where the exhibit will pause in such august halls as those of the Brooklyn Museum of Art , the Corcoran in Washington , the Indianapolis Museum of Art , and the Seattle Art Museum , just to name a few . That could be honor enough , but that is not all . What is happening is that more than a million Americans are appearing to view the collection , and at least many of them are not habitual visitors to fine arts museums . The curator of one museum tells with awe in his voice that , whereas his normal attendance might be around 500 visitors per month , with barely any publicity at all the whisper that the Rockwell collection was in town brought out 500 visitors per day . Other curators have reported that the crowds include the expected older group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post , but now they have to share the viewing with hordes of young people , equally eager to discover the verities of the y ears preceding them . Nostalgia perhaps . . . but something more than that for the young ones , something to discover , something to hang on to . Touching moments , too . A mature man stands close to a Rockwell cover featuring an apple-cheeked boy . " I was that boy . I modelled for Rockwell . " The years vanish and melt together on the canvas . A lady in a wheelchair is shepherded through the halls by her husband . She is blind . " Tell me about this one , dear . Do n't leave out a thing . " The man describes the Rockwell Post cover . A smile plays over her face . Now she can see it all again just as it was . What a man , what a gift , this Norman Rockwell ! Everywhere the show goes , lie is feature material in the newspapers . A lesser man might just sit back in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world go by . He has everything there . A classic home in a storybook village . A wife of patrician beauty , a personality in her own right as an educator . A perfect studio to work in , overlooking a river , the Housatonic , named by the Indians and storied with historical lore . A rim of small mountains to hold off the strife of Outside . But Norman Rockwell is a man who knows that the secret of living is to live . Therefore he is constantly busy at one project or another . He travels . He paints . The world comes to his door , and finds him away  --  he is out , again seeking the world . He is one for greener pastures . Shown here on the opposite page is one of his newest marvels . It is the commanding portrait of Walter Brennan which Rockwell has just completed for The National Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma . There is an amusing story about how it possibly might never have been painted , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fame , who tells the yarn with a beat of typical Will Rogers Oklahoma humor . These are his own words : " I will never forget the day that Walter Brennan and I went to see Norman Rockwell . It was a beautiful , clear , crisp October day . We drove from Boston to Stockbridge with Roger Wells . Roger is sheriff of Essex County , Massachusetts . Roger 's father was a cousin of Walter 's wile Ruth . Roger Wells is a tall man with a youthful look and bounce about him . I was interested in the way he had of tilting his head and smoking , much in the manner of F.D.R. It was fun tooling along in that long black ' limo ' on a freeway  --  with sirens screaming and lights flashing , with Sheriff Wells sitting in the back seat smoking through that long stemmed holder . You felt that we were heading for something big . " This autumn day was big enough for me , accompanying one of America 's best-loved actors ( three Academy Awards ) to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening Post covers to his credit ) in the sheriff 's long black limousine . I was in tall cotton . When I got back to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and around trustees who are pretty big in their own right , I imagined that I could drop such lines like ' Well , as Walter Brennan said to Norman Rockwell , " How does Dean like this or that " ' and so on . " How did this all come about ? " It all goes back to Joel McCrea ( who did eighty-throe movies himself ) . Joel was the second living motion picture star to be elected back in 1968 to the Hall of Fame of Great Western Performers by the executive committee of the board of trustees . After he was inducted , the board wanted a portrait painted . I came up with the name of Bettina Steinke , of Taos , New Mexico , // who had done a painting of Will Rogers that Joel liked . Will got Joel started in the movies , so it was a meaningful tie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . It took Bettina about six months to make the drawings and finish the picture . She did a great job . The painting became a big attraction to our tens of thousands of visitors . Then Bettina did a painting of Miss Kitty ( Amanda Blake ) . Miss Kitty was the first living honoree elected to our motion picture Hall of Fame . " In 1970 , when Walter Brennan was nominated and elected from a field of eight nominees , we got to thinking at one of our executive committee meetings about who should do Walter 's picture . Everyone was scratching his head about it , but we all agreed on one thing  --  Bettina should n't do it , because she had already painted three and a fourth would be too many . But sure enough , two days later I was on the telephone with Bettina . She called and was telling inc how she was preparing to do her preliminary drawings of Walter in Hollywood . " I knew 1 had to say something fast because my courage was about to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bettina . So 1 blurted out to Bettina , ' the board has gone and asked Norman Rockwell to do it , and he 's all excited . Walter is one of Mr. Rockwell 's favorite movie stars . Why Norman said he 'd never missed an episode of " The Real McCoys. " ' 1 topped it off with ' I doubt if he even charges , he is so pleased . ' Well , that left her aghast , as near as 1 could tell , but she recovered in time to say graciously that Rockwell should do it . The next day I said to my secretary , Shirley , ' You know , Norman 's going to do Walter 's picture . ' Right off she said : ' Norman who ? ? and are you talking about Walter Brennan ? ' I shot back : ' Yes  --  Mr. Brennan and Rockwell  --  Norman Rockwell . You know him . He 's excited to do it . ' Shirley 's been around me a while ( about five years ) and she said ' Fine but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter off to Rockwell right away . " Norman Rockwell was very forthright in his reply . He had once been contacted to do a picture of Will Rogers by someone from Oklahoma and the deal had gone sour , and he wanted to know if I was the same guy who had done him an injustice . He signed it kinda cool . But now word had gotten out to board members that I had engaged Rockwell , and I could n't deny it . Even Bettina had told friends and they had told friends . And all up and down the main street of my home town ( Ault , Colorado  --  Pop . 730 ) people were talking about me  --  how a runny-nosed kid from across the railroad tracks , now growed up , had up andtalked America 's best-loved portrait painter into doing America 's best-loved motion picture actor . It was spread all over Ault 's weekly paper  --  even crowded out the headline about lightning striking Axel Larson 's cow . " The crowning glory of it all came one Sunday evening when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The phone rang and a high-pitched voice said : ' That you , Dean ? ' I said , ' Who 's this ? " This 's Walter . ' Walter ? ' . . . ' Walter ? ' The voice says : ' You know  --  Will Sonnett , Judge Roy Bean , Grampa McCoy . . " Oh , ' I came right back , ' Walter Brennan ! ' Well , Walter tells me he 's heard about Norman Rockwell going to do his painting and how happy he and his wife Ruth are about it . Then he tells me he 's from Boston ( Bas-tun is the way Walter pronounces it ) and will be going up there in a month to see some of his and Ruth 's kinfolks and could go right out to Stockbridge to see Norman , with a friend of his who 's sheriff of Essex County . Then Walter wants to know Norman 's telephone number . So , I cough around and say I 'm expecting a letter from Mr. Rockwell any day lining out a schedule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' As a matter of fact , I 'll be in the East next week and I may even call Mr. Rockwell . ' ( Imagine me talking on the phone with Norman Rockwell ! ) Well , Walter went on to tell me how excited he was about it , an ' all the while my Adam 's apple was sliding up and down my trachea or someplace below one of my chins . " I was in the East the next week . In fact , I was at Westport , Connecticut , with some friends , Harold Von Schmidt , another great magazine illustrator and painter , and his wife . During the evening , the name Norman Rockwell popped right out , just as if it had been planned . ' Pardon me , ' I said . ' Do you mean Norman Rockwell , the painter ? ' He said , ' I sure do . Norman and I have been friends for many years . ' I said : ' Do you think he would be interested in doing a painting of Walter Brennan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got right on the telephone and in a flash was talking with Norman . Von gave us a real big buildup . Well , before I knew it , I was on the telephone talking to Norman Rockwell . He has a real deep , throaty voice . He gave a long ' Hello , ' and he said , ' You ai n't the man from Oklahoma who wanted the portrait of Will Rogers done are you ? It went sour . ' I said , ' Heck no , ' and right off told him about Walter Brennan . He said ' Oh yeah ! I liked him in " The Real McCoys . " Why do n't you write me and then I 'll think it over . ' Von closed out the conversation with more good words about the Hall . " When I arrived back at the National Cowboy Hall of Fame , I dictated a letter to Shirley to be mailed to Mr. Rockwell . Within a few days I had a favorable reply . Mr. Rockwell asked if I could get Mr. Brennan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote back that I would sure go to work on it . I telephoned Walter and we set the date on a Saturday . " 1 firmed the date up with Mr. Rockwell . Walter and Roger met me at the Boston airport on Friday night . Walter was excited about what we were going to do the next day , as I was . When we got there Walter and Norman immediately took to each other and horsed around as if they had been friends for years . They exchanged hats and Norman took to ordering Walter around because he 'd discovered he was the older by about three days . It was a wonderful day . " So this is my true confession . This is how Norman Rockwell happened to paint Walter Brennan 's picture . " Dean Krakel 's engaging yarn of how he at last assigned Norman Rockwell to the Brennan portrait , contains some of the pixie element which keeps cropping up in Rockwell 's own character all the time . Rockwell is a man of many surprises . One reason why he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , for instance , is his attitude towards his work . Says N.R. : " Some illustrators feel that their commercial work is just a way of making a living ? nothing more . Their serious painting  --  the painting by which they hope to be remembered and into which they pour their talents , ideas , and energies  --  they do in their spare time . " I do n't feel that way . A Post cover , an ad , an illustration is never just a check to me . It means a whole lot more than that . Whatever talents , energies , and ideas I have go into a painting of it . Consequently I rarely do anything but my regular work . I can not really convince myself that any painting is good unless it is popular . " When I get to feeling in a rut , I hire a model and do some sketching , or join a sketch class , or go off on a trip with my sketchbook  --  but never with the idea of giving up my regular work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What results has all of the familiar Rockwellian charm , but a looseness which comes as a surprise to those who have grown to think of the Rockwell technique as tight and photographic . For Norman can be as loose as Toulouse when he chooses . His sketchbooks are filled with fascinating little vignettes , drawn with an easy pencil . The wonderful draughtmanship is there , but here the lines are relaxed and tentative . Country homes in France . An old man fishing in the rain , seated on a stool under his umbrella . Spanish wine drinkers . Lebanese merchants  --  you can guess the swiftness ofthe pencil from the dash of the lines . A dancer in Thailand  --  the merest outline of a tiny , graceful figure . " Camera-mad Japan , " with everyone taking pictures of everyone else . Somehow or other , Rockwell 's successfully perverse way of regarding his commercial work as his most important is in keeping with him . Rockwell is secure in his position as the mirror of rural America . We know that he used his neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homespun Post cover . His feeling for country things is as sure as Grandma Moses ' . Yet Rockwell was born , in his own words , in " the back bedroom of a shabby brownstone in New York City . I arrive(d) in the world feet first at 2:00 a.m. , " February 3 , 1894 . There was something about the stone and steel of the city which made a country man out of Norman  --  he must have yearned so for the natural open spaces that when he found them he learned their secrets even more intimately than one native to the rural scene . Thomas Buechner has placed Rockwell by saying : " For many he records the time of our pride with such passionate accuracy and gentle . humor that we are overwhelmed by the joys of nostalgia . For others , the young in particular , his visual stories are wonderfully entertaining and beautifully told . It is youth 's fascination with Rockwell that promises a future as popular as his past . " As for Norman Rockwell the actor , the fact is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making his official debut . Kenneth Stuart , who was art director of The Saturday Evening Post during Rockwell 's most prolific years , reveals that Norman constantly showed an enormous talent for mimicry and acting which found its way into his paintings . Before he painted a character , he acted it out , he became that person . Recently , inspired by the erudite theories of Stanislaysky , that approach has become known as The Method School of acting , and many of our best stage personalities have used it on their way to stardom , But Norman Rockwell evidently knew about The Method all along  --  and what 's more , he could paint it , besides . Norman Rockwell , as TV actor , had only to be himself . He is the star of the show , in a cast of characters including wife Molly and a goodly portion of the townspeople in his native heath of Stockbridge , Mass . The film was shot not very long ago by Concepts Unlimited , Inc. , and will be shown nationally as a half-hour special over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrow Company , in itself something of a comparable American institution . The film consists of a retrospective nar80 THE // rative , spoken by Rockwell himself , in which flashbacks of his work , life , and career are superimposed over the flowing scene of Norman and Molly on their daily bike ride . Weather permitting , young man Rock well never misses his four-andone-half-mile whirl through Stockbridge streets and byways , a triumphal progress which includes hand waves from every cameras , and producer Richard Barclay were completely captivated by Rockwell , and also completely bushed  --  they rather shamefacedly report  --  as the " elderly " gentleman pedaled his way a number of times over the prescribed course for the shooting , and swiftly coursed up hills on his wheels , while in his wake the young TV people had to dismount and puff their way The TV motion picture has a quiet excitement to it which was sparked by the nearness of Rockwell himself . Some of its footage is seen with this article . And perhaps a snip or two from the script will help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new world of Norman Rockwell with us , please  --  entitled An American Dream . This is how a TV script sets the action : We are in the actual town itself  --  the main street of Stockbridge , just as Rockwell painted it . It is Stockbridge come to life on an early spring morning . The town looks fresh and sparkling in the clear sunlight . We see and hear the sights and sounds of the town 's awakening . A kid rides by a house on a bike , tossing the morning paper on the porch . A storekeeper rolls down his awning as he opens up for the day . A fruit-store starts putting out its display of fruit . A housewife , still in her robe , steps out of her front door and picks up the fresh milk left on her doorstep . She goes back into the house . A moment later she opens the door to let the dog out . A mailman starts his rounds . The empty streets come alive with people leaving for work or shopping . A schoolbus loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bears the name of the town and the year it was founded . It reads " Stockbridge , Mass. ( 1739 ) . " The bus drives by it and passes in front of the Rockwell home . We dissolve to Norman Rockwell and his wife , Molly , emerging from their home . We hear his voice as the action continues . Rockwell 's Voice Over citizen and kid in sight , each proud to be connected with this storybook celebrity in their midst . It happens every time he pedals out , but this time the camera catches it . The camera is the eye behind the handlebars , and the ride is one of incomparable charm  --  dappled , shaded streets , and green lawns , hills and fields straight out of a Rockwell painting . The men working theup the grades on foot . Rockwell 's voice was taped over long and exhausting hours in which the artist revealed his patience , and the quicksilver humor  --  hidden deep and flickering up to the surface only to vanish again . " This is the gentle soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks of his days in Stockbridge as one might of a pilgrimage . I just love Stockbridge and unless people live in a closet and do n't come out , I know everybody in Stockbridge . I think . They are riding down the path . You know my wife goes out and gets the mail every morning and she meets so-and-so and she tells me all the news . It 's a beautiful town . THE SRTURDJIY EVENING POST By this time Rockwell and his wife are on the main street . We dissolve from them ( live ) on their bikes to a painting of them on bikes . Supered over this panoramic painting is the title of the film . We pick up Rockwell and his wife still riding through town . Rockwell 's Voice Over I use my neighbors as models . . We cut to some townspeople . A boy washing a car . A man mowing a lawn . There 's almost nobody in town I have n't painted . Cut to young boy leaning against a tree . We come in for a closeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting of the same boy . Then we cut back to the boy live . He smiles and waves at the Rock-wells as they pass by him on their bikes . We stay with the Rock-wells a little longer until we pass a pretty girl sitting on a park bench . We see her from Rockwell 's point of view . From a closeup of her face ( live ) we go to a painting of the same girl .. . then we cut back to Rockwell as he continues on his way . Rockwell 's Voice I like to paint just regular people and they 're my neighbors and I know them all . We see a row of houses from Rockwell 's point of view . People are seen coming and going from these houses . Rockwell 's Voice Lately , I used a retired admiral who lives down the street . We see the old admiral coming out of one of the houses .

( Laughs ) Cut from painting of the admiral to the admiral ( live ) . We see him wave to Rockwell as Rockwell continues bicycling down the street . We move in for a closeup of Rockwell . Rockwell 's Voice Over Every once in a while somebody says that I 'm an historian of a better period in America . . . . It was a good period . uh . . . but I 'm not an historian . I just painted the things I saw around me ? . Rockwell 's remark is instantly dramatized by Rockwell 's paintings and film clips of the events that inspired those paintings . This montage , covering the past six decades , will depict each decade with a different cinematic treatment and variation of the theme music . This theme music will be in counterpoint to the music associated with each decade . This sequence , in effect , will be a retrospective of Rockwell 's work and American history . . . starting with the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century .

Part of the new life of Norman Rockwell is  --  you may be sure to his infinite delight  --  suddenly connected with the unexpected emergence of a painting he had done some fifty years ago , but which by force of perverse circumstance had really never been seen until now . This is the charming scene of a young mother sending her recalcitrant son and pert daughter off to First Day of School , which appears on the page opposite . It is a cameo of life in the years before 1920 and perhaps it will offset some of the impressions given us by the photography of that period  --  to the effect that every woman was a full-blown parade of ostrich feathers , billowing skirts and bustles under full sail and that our nation would never fail to throw its weight around as long as its womanhood was available .

And that 's why today , when he has lost all control of , indeed all contact with , his empire , he can afford to live like an emperor . That 's one way of telling the story . The other way , the hard fact way , is this : a couple of years ago the stock market all over the world began to dip . The earnings of Bernie 's companies were affected , of course , but more by massive investment in plans for future profit . Expenses went up as they did with every company , as they did in every household . The price of the company 's stock , enthusiastically high at first , began to drop to a more reasonable level . A company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgments could have ridden out the turbulence . But Bernie , the incurable social worker , had with the best of intentions built a company of such unlikely ingredients as kindness and sharing . Unlike the heads of many other personally created companies , who take most of the winnings for themselves and leave comparative peanuts for those under them , all Bernie 's executives owned healthy chunks of the company , had become rich with its rise . " When they had nothing , " Bernie sighed , " they were risk-takers , fighters . As soon as they had a lot , they panicked at the first threat . They called in outsiders to save them . The outsiders raped them . " When the battle for control of I.O.S. was raging , and when headlines in the financial press carried news of defeat after defeat for Bernie at the hands of cabals of old pals , I asked him who , in the end , would wind up with I.O.S.

O.S. It would be simpler and infinitely less troublesome for Bernie to create a brand-new company , but his affection for I.O.S. is comparable to a mother 's for an unruly , unpromising child  --  who is confident she can nurse it back to normalcy , even though she might have a far easier time starting afresh with a brand-new baby . Can he do it ? " I did do it , " he said . " Then they tried and they could n't . Yes ... I think 1 can do it again .

Everything was done in those early war years to conceal his infirmity . Today the public would know all about such a thing . But then it was not generally realized that he had to be virtually carried everywhere he went . And when we photographers finally got a chance to shoot him , it was all stage set in advance . He would be propped up in his chair at his desk , and it often looked as though his back were propped up as well . With another subject , it would have been a disaster . But FDR had that great smile and a fine head and somehow or other the pictures came off . But we had to work fast . And we were allowed only two flash bulbs apiece . " Harry Truman was another story . He was full of vitality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't write anything bad about me . ' The problem with Truman was his glasses . They had such magnification that if you were n't careful his eyeballs might come out looking like saucers . We tried hard not to do that " Ike Eisenhower was the perfect subject for a photographer , with his so-called ' rubber face . ' He had such a variety of expressions chasing each other across his face that one time I made an entire magazine layout consisting entirely of the different facial expressions I had caught during one press conference . " John F. Kennedy , of course , was easy to photograph . Ike had run the White House very much as a general would , with everything scheduled and ordered , and in many ways Nixon was to take his cue from Eisenhower in this . But Kennedy was very informal and impromptu . Just the same , though , everything he did served a purpose . That applied to photographs , too .

He was a Texas cowboy in looks and manners . He could get sore when a ceremony went wrong and dress down everyone in sight , right out in the open . And pull open his shirt to show his surgical scar . Well , let me say that President Nixon would n't do that . " The President is very serious about his job . He does n't worry about the photography side of it , or have a special profile angle which he favors over any others as one president did . He is distinctive among all of the presidents I have photographed in that he sees no point in trying to make him appear what he is not . He is a businessman type , orderly and perfectly self-disciplined . He those years . The story of the discovery of this fine portrait is told by no less a person than Dr. Malouf Abraham , Jr. , of Canadian , Texas , its owner , who has so graciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first publication after all these years ! Something about a Rockwellian experience seems to loosen the restraints of normal reportage . Here is Dr. Abraham 's own version of how he acquired his painting , demonstrating an ebullience equal to Dean Krakel 's : " Crazy , wonderful things are always happening to me . For instance , the day I bought the Rockwell painting started as an ordinary sort of day . There I was , a young doctor from a little Texas town , walking down the sidewalks of New York , gawking at all the sights of the big city . Buying anything over five dollars was the farthest thing from my mind , 1 assure you . " In my exploring I just happened to go into a Lexington Avenue gallery and in visiting with the owner he mentioned that a Rockwell painting had just been acquired the day before . It had been in the attic of an old man who had been a head engraver . Would 1 like to see it ? Good grief , yes ! ( This is where the ordinary day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There it was  --  Norman Rockwell 's First Day of School  --  covered with the grime and dust of fifty years in the attic . I immediately felt the ' desire to possess it . ' I took a wet towel and wiped some of the dirt off so I could tell more about the true colors . Brilliant colors ! Fantastic emotion in each face ! I was enchanted ! I had to have this painting ! My intuition was absolutely yelling at me  --  saying , ' Buy it ! Do n't call your wife . Do n't call the bank . Do n't sleep on it  --  just buy it right now ! ' " Some people might say the devil made me do it . I like to say it was ' my intuition ' ? the same intuition that helped me choose a lot of other things that I love dearly , such as Medicine and the girl I married . " So there we are . Strange and wonderful , too , that one touch of Rockwell makes the whole world kin . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting neven before shown  --  almost as enviable as seeing for the umpteenth time an original Rockwell painting which improves upon every viewing . For such is the way of true genius -- a light in our dark , glowing ever brighter and brighter .
