Companionship as preventive medicine <P> Health studies have long shown that single , widowed and divorced people are far likelier prey to disease than married folk . Some examples : the coronary death rate among widows between 25 and 34 is five times that of married women in the same age group . At all ages , the divorced are twice as likely as the married to develop lung cancer or suffer a stroke . Among divorced white males , cirrhosis of the liver is seven times more common , and tuberculosis ten times more common . <P> Why should it be so ? To Psychologist James J. Lynch , 38 , author of a new book , The Broken Heart : The Medical Consequences of Loneliness ( Basic Books ; $10.95 ) , the answer is obvious : loneliness kills . Says he : " Loneliness is not only pushing our culture to the breaking point , it is pushing our physical health to the breaking point . " <P> A specialist in psychosomatic medicine at the University of Maryland Medical School , Lynch argues that social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he notes , have a far higher coronary death rate than their brothers left behind in the more closely knit culture of the old sod . Nevada , a freewheeling singles-oriented state , has a higher rate of death from heart disease than neighboring Utah , with its Mormon tradition of close family ties . One study showed that in Roseto , an Italian American community in Pennsylvania , there were only one-third as many heart attacks as in culturally diversified surrounding towns . The study 's conclusion : unusually close family and community ties in this town helped keep down the number of heart problems . Says Lynch : " Medical practitioners must make people aware that their family and social life are every bit as important to health as dieting and exercising . " <P> Voodoo spells , he says , often are effective in primitive cultures because they produce a social isolation that makes illness more likely , and religion has traditionally promoted good health by providing companionship and hope . The lesson for America 's doctors , he believes , is that an old-fashioned bedside manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be counterproductive , he says , to send patients away with pills when what they need is human contact . <P> Lynch developed his theory while conducting a series of animal experiments that showed petting could produce " profound effects on the cardiovascular system of dogs . " A similar result is found among human patients-even people in deep comas often show improved heart rates when their hands are held by doctors or nurses . Lynch 's point is that medical personnel intuitively know the healing value of the human touch but sometimes manage to overlook the principle because it seems unscientific.
