txt LESS TITAN 24 hours after Gov . Thompson signed a bill abolishing the state 's usury ceiling for 26 months , Chicago-area savings and loans began to raise mortgage rates to record highs and increase mortgage money availability . First Federal Savings and Loan of Chicago , the biggest S &L; in Illinois , announced Friday it is increasing its basic mortgage rate from 111/2 per cent to 131/2 per cent , but decreasing down payment requirements . Borrowers at First Federal now have a minimum down payment ranging from 25 to 35 per cent of the home price , depending on the size of loan and type of residence . Down payznent requirements had ranged from 35 to 50 per cent . Meanwhile , St. Paul Federal Savings and Loan , which had stopped making mortgage loans Oct. 16 because it could n't charge rates high enough to cover its cost of attracting funds , opened lending windows again Friday . Borrowers at St. Paul must have a minimum of 20 per cent down and will pay 131/4 per cent for mortgages on single-family homes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 30 per cent down , will pay 131/2 per cent . " OUR NEW RATES are based en the current costs of money and our ability to obtain housing dollars in today 's highly competitive and volatile market , " said E. Stanley Enlund , First Federal 's chairman . " Elimination of the usury ceiling in Illinois will allow First Federal to remain in the mortgage market for at least a little while longer , although this is a function of our being able to attract savings dollars that can be // // Mortgage rates hit 131/2% here // placed into home mortgage lending . " Besides being hampered by the usury limit , which was 111/4 per cent before the bill was passed , savings and loan Industry leaders said they have been faced with declining inflows of savings , a major source of money for mortgage loans . Depositors increasingly have been switching their funds to more attractive investments . " There will be money available , " said Leo Dignan , senior vice president of St. Paul . " It may be at a higher price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people owning two homes . " Some Chicago-area residents who bought homes recently found that mortgage money Shortages prevented them from selling their old houses . DIGNAN SAID St. Paul Is experiencing strong savings inflows , unlike some other institutions . He said St , Paul will use funds from depositors ' " money market " certificates of deposit for mortgages . Until now , many S &Ls; refused to use proceeds from the certificates because their interest rates were skyrocketing beyond the usury ceiling rate . This week , hanks and savings and loans can pay almost 12.1 per cent interest on the certificates . The new law removes restrictions on the amount of interest lenders can charge homebuyers until Dec. 31 , 1981 , when the old usury law goes back into effect unless another measure is passed . Under the old law , the ceiling is determined monthly based on an Index of long-term U.S. government bond yields .

" I think what we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to digest the impact " of higher rates , he said .
