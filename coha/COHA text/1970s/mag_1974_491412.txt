Mike Douglas emerges from the swamp gas of American talk shows a pertinent , perspicacious , poignant ( when he sings ) , plumb performer who fields the slightly faggy-waggy chatter of show biz people on his ninety-minute afternoon pro  --  gram with the strong right glove of a golfer who shoots in the low seventies and won the amateur spot in last year 's Jackie Gleason 's Inverrary Clas  --  sic . " I do n't know any show biz people , " he says . " Most of my friends are dermatologists and dentists . " He has of course no professional use for the dermatologists ( his skin is Irish-apple-rosy ) , or dentists ( a smile so sincere it did n't need cap  --  ping ) , but he needs them perhaps to stay on the ground . He makes $2 million a year ( TV 's top salary ) , is seen by more eyes than any single star , and his ad breaks are television 's hottest selling spots . He barely changes the television voice of the shows that precede him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , you feel you are being taken into a world as intimate as " Secret Storm " or " As the World Turns " and not nearly as emotionally exhausting . So capable is he , so well does he inspire confidence and credibility , that an intelligent protection of your sensibili  --  ties , a censorship of vulgarity and venality , all without a trace of Big Brotherhood , fashions it  --  self into a compendium of taste and timeliness unlike anything else in Cyclops 's pupil . " I 'm absolutely uncomfortable sitting here  --  being interviewed instead of interviewing , " he tells you . And indeed he is so nice lie 's hard to get hooks into . You ask him where he was born and when he first started singing . " Chicago , West side . Sang before I could talk . " He 's no Simon and Garfunkel . But he is der Bingle , Perry Como , Andy Williams , those crooners who stumble around within the limits of perfect pitch . Singers who look at you . The notes come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born at home  --  no hospital . My father was the freight agent for a railroad . " It is a good time Ile speaks of  --  Home , the Irish , the Railroad . Poverty , untainted by aspects of welfare , was re  --  spectable , pure , the natural guerdon of hard work , gaslights , buckets of beer and lace curtains . Mike is of course not remotely that old , but one of the beauties of nostalgia is that it can stretch back to all inclusive infinity . When Mike re  --  members , everyone remembers . How did you get interested in show biz ? ( On Mike Douglas , the expression must be transposed to " entertainment . " ) " One day we cut school to see Bob Eberly . He came out in brown and white shoes and stuff plastered on his hair and I said that 's for me . " In those days the wet look was n't dead and Eberly was wafting " The Breeze and I , " ' I ' being America , and influencing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " the best in our business . " Between being a truant and an altar boy  --  the duality of the Douglas nature persists in his shows  --  zingy asides with sincere , I-cannot-tell-a  --  lie endorsements  --  The Big Show ( World War II ) broke out and Mike , barely out of pimples , was in bell bottoms . " They sent me to the University of Wiscon  --  sin ? a V-12 course . They try to make an officer of you in ninety days . Took them 180 with me . I was in every theater of the war . Around the world . Great place ! " It was while he was hitting ports like Perth , Colombo , Aden and Hong Kong that Mike began to take himself and the world seriously , a neces  --  sary direction for comedians . " I met educated people , borrowed books . But I 'm not what you 'd call an intellectual .... " " Jackie is , though ( Gleason ) . " ( After saying he does n't know show business people he talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody 's interested in a funny story that happened on the golf course to a gynecologist , but drop the name Dean Martin . ) " I 'm very tight with Jackie . He 's not on all the time like a lot of people . He 's got a library ... ( Mike 's arms stretch to indicate the wide world ) . I constantly send him books . When Blatty 's new book , I 'll Tell Them 1 Remember You , came out 1 sent it to him . He 'd had an experience like that with his mother after she died . " Other friends . Don Rickles . Liberace . Frank Sinatra . " Frank and I were together at the Crip  --  pled Children 's Benefit and he left early . Said he had to go to Washington ' to help a friend . ' He 's the most loyal guy in the business . " Still . Douglas says he 's comfortable out of . // show biz and in the suburbs . " My dentist friends do n't tell me their ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Dinner at six  --  always . Golf . " I was playing in the Pro-Am Tournament with Jack Nicklaus . As far as I 'm concerned he 's the greatest golfer of all time . I never concentrated harder , never played better and was never tireder in my life . " Douglas seems mildly surprised he was seated next to Nicklaus at the dinner and awards ceremony afterwards . He was once surprised to he invited to a White House dinner and to have Mrs. Lyndon Johnson exclaim after shaking a country mile of hands , " At last ! A familiar face . " Douglas supposedly has always appealed to women . " Must be his time slot  --  it 's certainly not his S. A. " says a national network official who several times has tried to lure Douglas away from his " smaller world , " his Philadelphia , his studio built just for him and his show , his KYW-TV ( a wholly owned subsidiary of Westinghouse ) . CBS and NBC have both yearned , at one time or another , for Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give him that same celestial body to keep him . " Gosh ! They 've been good to me , " he says , not quite innocently . " I had a list of twenty-eight things ... they met twenty-seven . " What was the one they did n't agree to ? " I ca n't remember , but it was so trivial we all laughed about it later . " What were the others ? Limousine to work . Valet to press the suits between shows . " Little things , " he says , but declines to elaborate . Mike leans back in his chair in the Mediterra  --  nean style office Westinghouse has given him . " My gal ( wife Genevieve ) decorated this , " and submits to a photographer who cups his subject 's fist , then uncups it , lifts his chin , lowers it , ( " 1 just got rid of one of those , three more to go , " ) smoothes his lapel . Never once does he flinch , although , like the courtiers at Louis XV 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nervous . " I 've never seen Mike lose his cool once in all the years I 've known him . " says Woody Frazer . Mike 's producer , the man who thought up the show and thought of Mike ( they had worked together in Chicago in the 50 's ) as the man to make it . " I was working for a network affiliate in Chi  --  cago and I had a great idea for a show  --  this one  --  and they said , ' Yeah , it 's great . We own you so it 's ours . ' So I quit and offered it to them again and they said , We 're not interested . ' My wife was pregnant , I was out of a job . I finally per  --  suaded a station in Cleveland to try it . I found Mike in California . He was great at the audition . " Mike is less adjectival . " The show did n't exactly explode right off . The Westinghouse people were very patient with me . I 'm grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opera on the opposite station . We made the contract  --  just sit  --  ting down  --  like friends . " " Mike gets angry sometimes , " says Woody , " but it 's always on a certain level . " Someone has suggested that the real genius on the Mike Douglas show is the author of the cue cards . " What gave you the idea for your book ? " for example . " When did you first start singing ( Enzo Stuarti ) , dancing ( Shirley Temple ) , paint  --  ing ( Tony Curtis ) , playing the violin ( Henny Youngman ) , acting ( Kirk  --  no relation  --  Douglas ) , dressing up ( Princess Grace  --  that was n't the ques  --  tion ; Mike is never mean ) , boxing ( Rocky Grazia  --  no ) , talking talk-show-talk ( Hugh Downs ) , eating no carbohydrates ( Dr. Atkins ) , riding motorcy  --  cles ( Evel Knievel ) , " and so on . Sounds simple and is . But it seems to release the sluice gates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modates himself to personal rhythms , " Carol Burnett says . Certainly , perfect pitch  --  he is mod  --  est enough to argue the point  --  holds him in good stead with the guests who gleefully perform for the low union scale fee of $306 . " After all , " says an aging vaudevillian , " if ten million people see you , somebody 's gon na notice you 're not dead even if your material is . " Sometimes Mike edits the cue cards himself - often moments before the live taping of his shows  --  or longer , if the guest is controversial . Not all guests are hoofers and howlers . Ralph Nader got his first television exposure outside of news tapes on the show . Robin Moore , whose book on corruption in the Army Service Clubs did n't exactly delight the Pentagon , was a guest . Masters and Johnson arc to be on . " I do n't talk about the news of the day , " says Douglas . " It would he pointless anyway because of the tape delay . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests Mike wants have to come to Philadelphia when they can , and after all , the medium permits the dis carding of sequential logic . ) " But I do have views , political opinions . I just do n't think peo  --  ple are interested in them . Besides , you lose half your audience when you take a side . " We do n't try to put anybody down . I like to make people on the show feel comfortable . " It is not as kind as it sounds ; people tend to reveal themselves . For example . There is a young school mistress to whom everything is " just so beautiful " ; she has a string of charges from her school , chosen no doubt for their adorableness , and she has been in the dressing rooms with her hair pinned down to make it do right on camera . Also in the dress  --  ing rooms is a man in a wig . You are mildly surprised , later , by their appearances on the mon  --  itor screen . She looks perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a special school in New York-despite the fact that they have been doing exercises to " heighten their visual percep  --  tion " and " stimulate their creativity , " end like children everywhere , by picking their noses and finding it difficult to tie their own shoe laces . A few of those " just so beautifuls " will be edited out . Because they are repetitive and because the kids in action just do n't turn out " so beautiful . " These muffed tapes are called outtakes . Every performer has his favorites . One day Mike does a fifteen-minute segment on outtakes . Tony Curtis is there and tells about Marilyn Monroe muffing a simple line , " Where 's the bourbon ? " forty-five times in the movie Some Like It Hot . " She said , ' Where is it ? ' and Billy Wilder said , ' You must say bourbon , ' and she came back on and said , ' Bourbon ? ' " Mike asks , " Did she have that kind of problem ? " " We all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . James Coco , star of " Calucci 's Department , " says he did I 20 takes of a simple scene in which he eats some spaghetti . No one can top that and a station break elimi  --  nates the competition . But Douglas is making mental notes and later tells his secretary , cooly efficient Sonya Selby-Wright ( English ) , to find out if someone 's re  --  marks on the show are libelous . " And I think so-and-so called so-and-so ( a Hollywood gossip columnist ) a liar and she 's a friend of mine . " Actually , both of them , caller and callee , arc along with everybody else . Mike snorts as he remembers his own experi  --  ences with gossip columnists . " A headline on a movie magazine my mother-in-law happened to see on a news stand in Florida made her call me long distance , so upset I could n't understand what she was saying . The magazine said , ' Mike Douglas 's two marriages . What he had to tell his family . ' It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were married first before a priest . Then before a J.P . Then there was another one , something about the ' Other Woman in Mike 's life . ' It was Kelly ( Douglas 's teenage daughter ) . " Mike has twin daughters who live in Ohio and Florida . One is married and makes him a grand  --  father occasionally . What does he admire most in a woman ' ? " In  --  telligence . I have a wife who did n't go . beyond high school , and she 's the brightest person I know . She 's such a help . I 'm taken in by people . I say , ' Isn't-so-and-so-great ? ' And she says , ' I real  --  ly do n't know yet . ' and when it all comes out she 's right to the letter . When I think of the deals I 'd have got into ! I do n't think I 'd be anywhere without that lady . " That lady is the blonde , pretty-enough-to-be. a-movie-star-herself , wife of twenty-nine years , Genevieve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's suits , and although they have a housekeeper now , Gen likes to " do things her way . " " Everybody says Mike is so sweet , " she says . " Well , he 's not that sweet . Normal . Irish-and you know about that temper . He 's uncomplicat  --  ed . But you do n't stay that way unless someone keeps you uncomplicated . I worry about him , though . Too many yes men around him . " The Douglases three , Mike , Gen and Kelly . " fifteen going on thirty , " according to Mike , live in an overblown , stockbroker-Tudor house which , says TV Guide , using the same formula for square roots , has " either 38 or 114 rooms . " " It was built in 1930 at a cost of over a mil  --  lion , " Mike rhapsodizes . " Three or four families have lived in it since and each has put $100,000 of improvements into it . " The nice thing about the house is that it has none of the staid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is exuberantly incongruous  --  exuberant in the sense that there 's a joyous feeling in being rich ; incongruous in that Kelly 's homework and occupations of the hour are as pertinent as some of the velvet covered furniture . " 1 feel like the new rich , " exclaimed Mrs. Doug las when they moved in . " You mean the old poor . " ( Mike . ) " When we first saw this house , I wondered whether we could afford it . I asked my business manager and he said , ' You can buy two . ' " Mike worries good-naturedly about his invest  --  ments . " You 're looking at one of the few people who 's lost money in IBM . " " Did n't you have about a thousand shares of Tootsie Roll one time ? " asks somebody . " Yeah , we made money on that . " Of course , on Mike 's salary , the possi  --  bilities of going bust are remote . How does he spend his money ? A house for his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf , but I never seem to get there . " He works fifty weeks of the year . Has a two week vacation , or as he suggests , recuperation . Often the show journeys to Lake Tahoe or to Hollywood . " That 's the worst place in the world ; you ca n't believe anything anybody says . And the jet lag on those trips is devastating . " If Philadelphia has its limits , Mike has n't found them . " I love it here . And so do the stars who come to be on the show . The atmosphere is more relaxed . " Certainly , nothing could be more relaxed than Douglas at rehearsal . " I 'm geared to a noon life , " he says . " An hour later and I 'd collapse . " So a little before noon , he leaves his office , goes through his dressing room , past a wardrobe that would outfit the entire Eighth Army ( the neckties , though worn only once , are curiously twisted and tormented ) , through the drafting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets , down a private- used by half the people in the show  --  elevator , then out to " ON . " " ON " is in an orderly disarray . The white chairs Mike and his guests sit in are covered with drop cloths . The band is cacophonously tuning up . Mike is in a warm chocolate brown leather coat , no more wrinkled than the cushy hack seat of the limousine would make it . His secretary , in a cream leather dress , is giving him a few letters to sign . Together they look like a caramel pud  --  ding . Mike snaps his fingers , in time with the music , opens up ( not very wide ) with " You Make Me Feel So Young . " The big French cameras are being rolled around for views . They arc adroitly maneuvered to avoid blocking the audience-to-be . Everybody begins to tap toes , nod heads . Henry Lee Tang , a dancer and dancing instructor , comes out and mothers Mike , Tony Curtis and James Coco into a series of steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moans Coco . " This is a cute step , " says Tony , never having lost his Bronx accent . Mike performs flaw  --  lessly . Later , before the live audience , the lovable Mike stumbles and pretends he 's unable to catch on . " He 's Irish ; that 's why he 's so dumb , " ex  --  claims a lady , obviously Irish herself . Coco re  --  peats his joke about not swimming . Mike shivers in tune , " MMMrnm , the water 's cold . " Tang to Coco who weighs in at 200 plus , " Keep your weight on your hack foot . " Coco , teetering , " You know what you 're asking ? " Mike has a marvelous talent for being infinite  --  ly on the edge of breaking up . Everyone else , including the audience , spurred on by Woody Frazier , is enjoying the brinkmanship . Suddenly it overflows . Laughter , loud music . Woody fran  --  tically pulling applause from the audience . You discover in that scene what a producer does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the uniform of the staff seems to be more jeans than blue suits . Woody is almost as funny as Mike Douglas . But there is a difference . His hair is too curly ; he ca n't sing . And his eyes  --  not Irish  --  do n't steal your heart away . Mason Reese , a child prodigious , helps Mike as co-host the next day . Mason has red hair and looks vaguely like an ad for Dutch Boy paint , and is , they say , a genius . Once when Dick Cavett , no beanpole , asked Mason if he were a dwarf , Mason shot back , " No , are you ? " Mason yawns when Ralph Nader says , " We are running out of land , " makes faces behind Mike , pulls off the clothes of an Evel Knievel toy . lie is fiendishly clever , reads college freshman material Continued on page 132 continued from page 61 though he is only in third grade , but he has the loneliness bright children often suffer . In Mike he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . Mike holds businessmen from New York who 've come for lunch  --  important people , sponsors  --  to finish a game he had started with Mason before the show . Mike is sincerely interested . There are no cameras around , and when he leaves the set , a terrible sort of dullness falls . Mason looks around bewildered . The musicians put their instruments down . It is not just the departure of the star . Mike has touched everyone . The audience  --  between takes  --  has been putty in his hand . " I 've lost fifteen pounds , " he explains to them with the warmth of a man Kay Kyser 's " Kollege of Musical Knowledge , " where he had his be  --  ginnings . " I learned a lot from them , but I do n't think I 've imitated them . I do n't think I 've plagiarized from anybody , " he says , considering , ex  --  amining himself as he would before entering the confessional , careful not to suggest to anyone that he is " an original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Disney film , and the producer said of Mike , " He can sing , but he ca n't talk . " Someone has suggested that as long as Mike remembers that he 'll have the best talk show on television . Mike talks beautifully , of course . But that is something smart conver  --  sationalists keep to themselves . 23 The plot thickens and curdles as the captain of Team A is jogging along a road , and Team B 's members , armed with bamboo swords and a net , way  --  lay the guy and attack . Just as they are about to dash his brains out on the curb , a member of Team B who is not in on the assassination attempt comes to the rescue  --  flipping the vil  --  lains through the air in all directions . In the process , he discovers that these are his own teammates and that he has allowed Team A 's captain to escape with only a wounded arm . Next scene : the dojo ( judo practice hall ) . Our hero is ostracized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ) the enemy , and his " friends " kick him to the ground . Whereupon someone from Team A runs by and slashes the arm of Captain B with a knife . Ah , so , the score is even . Team B and its coach bid a respectful adieu to the slasher and accept the inevi  --  tability and " rightness " of his act . Last scene : Captains A and B , their arms in slings , refuse to default , and face each other in mortal combat . To be continued next week . March 10 . Today is Hiroko 's wed ding . She is twenty-five and Mrs. Hagiwara 's youngest sister . We ar rived at the famous Meiji Shrine and were led into a smallish room lined with chairs . The two families sat down on either side , facing each oth er coldly like feuding Hatfields and McCoys , and sipping their ceremo nial saltwater with cher ry blossoms floating in who understands his au  --  dience is overweight too . Then he leans a lit  --  tle closer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ing to fall down . " The grandmothers howl . It has been a ninety-min  --  ute program . But people look around as if to say , " Ca n't we have some more ? " Tomorrow they can have some more . Claire Abate , an ageless blonde , will be at the front desk with a ticker , counting bodies . " She ought to be a judge , " says one of the door  --  men , " she can make hanging sound so pleas  --  ant . " What he means is that of all the hundreds who fight for tickets to the show , somebody is bound to be disappoint  --  ed and Claire will soothe the wound . She will marshall the guests to their seats , smiling with human teeth while the celebrities will be giving out with their aggres  --  sively nice choppers . And Claire will perch herself on a barstool be hind the orchestra to watch the show , her mouth slightly open as if she had never seen M.D. and all the stars that round him burn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and somebody says once she was so gravely ill physi  --  cians despaired of her life . " It 's all just sort of wonderful for her now , as if she were home free , " says a friend . Mike has come a long way from Don McNeill 's " Breakfast Club " andit . When someone of rank entered , everyone jumped up and bowed like those mechanical birds which dip their beaks into glasses of water . All the married women wore decorated black kimonos ; the un  --  married ( if they were not in Western dress ) wore bright kimonos in pinks and blues ; the bride was in a Western gown ; the men in black suits or tails . After much to-do over me , a foreign  --  er , we all paraded into the marriage hall for a Shinto ceremony and dancing . We filed out ten minutes later to pose for a wedding portrait , and then into the ban  --  quet room  --  where there was a long delay at the door as each family urged the other to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seniority with amused detachment-1 , as the newest family member , would be the last in . Once seated at long tables , we listened with drooping eyelids to long-winded congratula  --  tions by friends and the middleman who arrang  --  ed the wedding . On and on they droned , their words accompanied by a new dish of food , anoth  --  er drink of some sort  --  all moving by as if on a conveyor belt . Mean  --  while , the bride and groom listened to all this with glazed eyes and finally Hiroko went out and returned Miss Amer  --  ica style in a ceremonial kimono and formal wig . More eating and talk  --  ing  --  then suddenly it
