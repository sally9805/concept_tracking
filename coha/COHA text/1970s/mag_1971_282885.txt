For ten weeks during the summer , the Chicago-based Zenith Life Insurance Co. tried a four-day , 35-hour routine , with half of its 33 employees working Monday through Thursday , 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. , the other half Tuesday through Friday .

Recruiting is easier , absenteeism reduced , overtime pay decreased and employee morale vastly improved . <P> The four-day plan has yielded unusual payoffs in other areas .

Response time on emergency calls is down , arrests have increased by 9% , and absenteeism has been cut by 16% . The ten-hour days allow for overlapping shifts , thus concentrating police coverage during high-crime hours . <P> If four-day schedules become a national routine , presumably various three-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week to ease pressure on already overburdened recreational facilities . In an increasingly secularized society , what began as the Sabbath will be turning into Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday " weekends . "
