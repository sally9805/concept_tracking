txt President Ford last ! nigliCurged that " some responsible - 'group or organization " . investigate " new developments " that have arisen concerning the assassinations of President Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . Under questioning by reporters at a White House news conference , the President said he favored such an inquiry in the Kennedy case if the new developments could be " investigated without reopening the whole matter ... I think some responsible group or organization should do so , but not to report on all other aspects . " Question 21 , Page 42 . He said that because he had served on the Warren Commission in the Kennedy assassination , a new inquiry ' should be conducted by " somebody other than I appoint . " ? He declined to call the new information " evidence " and noted that a " staff member " thinks a new inquiry should be undertaken . This is an apparent reference to David W. Belin , a senior staff member on the Warren Commission , who , last Saturiday , urged Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest the questions posed by the new data . Earlier today Attorney General Edward H. Levi announced through a spokesman that he had assigned two top level Department of Justice officials Ito review the investigation of I Dr. King 's death in the light of testimony that the black ' leader had been a target of I harassment by the Federal Bil . etc York Times reau of Investigation . ' A : splikiiiriii-for ? IVIr . Levi ! said the Attorney General had ! instructed J. Stanley Pottinger and Richard L. Thornburgh , Assistant Attorneys General , to review the file and advise him on whether the investigation should be reopened . . President Ford told reporters : tonight that he also favored an effort to identify the men in ' the F.B.I . who had subjected ; Dr. King to the harassment . The " new developments " in ! the Kennedy assassination are mainly the information that the Central Intelligence Agency never told the Warren Commis // sion that it had mounted several plots against Prime Minister Fidel Castro of Cuba . This was the first time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kennedy assassination might warrant investigation . Although the President had never said in the past that he opposed a reopened inquiry he had always stood by the findings of the Warren Commission . The President again said that he had ordered that " under no circumstances should any agency of this Government , while I 'm President , participate in or plan for any ' assassination of a foreign leader . " He also said that he . had ordered the intelligence agencies not to violate the law protecting the privacy of citizens . The Warren Commission , to which Mr. Ford alluded , did not investigate Dr. King 's death . It served for 10 months in 1964 , investigating the shooting of President Kennedy in Dallas on Nov. 22 , 1963 . It concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald , a marine who had defected to the Soviet Union , had acted alone in killing the President . A Spokesman for Mr. Levi , in referring to the review to be conducted on Dr. King 's case , said " this is. not in itself a reopening of - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original investigation was anything less than thorough . " He said that Mr. Levi ordered the review after testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence confirmed that the F.B.I . had conducted a six-year effort to discredit Dr. King and to remove him from leadership of the civil rights movement . It was the F.B.I . that also conducted the investigation of the killing . Dr. King , who led the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to the forefront of the civil rights movement , was shot to death on the balcony of a Memphis motel on April 4 , 1968 . The F.B.I . later identified the killer as James Earl Ray , a former convict . Mr. Ray was apprehended after an international manhunt and pleaded guilty to the charge . He has now repudiated his confession and is seeking a new trial . Mr. Ray , who is serving a life sentence in Tennessee , had no comment on Mr. Levi 's order , according to prison officials . The Justice Department spokesman could not estimate when the review would be completed . He said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said that one lawyer in the Civil Division had Characterized the investigation as " incredibly thorough . " In two days of hearings last week , the Senate intelligence committee disclosed a pattern of harassment by the F.B.I . that began in 1962 and dogged Dr. King until his death . The bureau  --  placed 16 wiretaps and eight room bugs on telephones or premises used by Dr. King . It had obtained authorisation for only three from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy in 1963 on the ground that it suspected that Communist sympathizers had infiltrated the civil rights movement . In addition to the electronic surveillance of Dr. King , testimony showed that the bureau had attempted to stop a college from giving him an honorary degree , tried to keep him from getting an audience with the Pope and once sent him a tape recording of allegedly unsavory incidents picked up by telephone taps and room bugs . . The tape was accompanied by a letter that warned Dr. King , " There is only one thing left for you to do . You know what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way out for you . " Dr. King regarded this as an effort to drive him to suicide , according to statements made at the hearings . 25 Separate Incidents James B. Adams , an assodiate deputy director of the F.B.I. , said that the bureau had discovered 25 separate incidents of harassment of Dr. King . Mr. Adams acknowledged in his testimony that there was ? ' no statutory basis or justification " for the F.B.I . ' s action against Dr. King . Of the various acts of harassment , the Senate investigators found one that came within days of Dr. King 's death . According to Michael Epstein , a member of the staff , when Dr. King first went to Memphis in behalf of striking garbage workers in March 1968 , he stayed at -a motel owned by whites . Bureau documents showed that the F.B.I . had suggested leaking this information to the press . There was no evidence ' that it did , Mr. Epstein testified , tut several news organizations : sent out an article saying that . Dr. King stayed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ' early April , he registered at the black-owned Lorraine ' Hotel , where he was killed . The Justice Department has for some time been conducting a separate investigation to determine whether any agents violated the law in the treatment of Dr. King .
