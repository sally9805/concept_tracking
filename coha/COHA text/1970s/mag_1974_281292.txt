For Pop Singer Jim Croce , the touring life meant mostly one small college campus after another . When he was killed at age 30 last September in Natchitoches , La. , he was doing what he had done many times before-taking off at night in a light plane from a small airstrip . Croce then was regarded as just another pop singer with a couple of hits to his credit , notably Bad , Bad Leroy Brown ( " Badder than old King Kong And meaner than a junkyard dog " ) . But the pop woods are full of singer-composers who have momentary success and are never heard from again . In Croce 's case , few ever dreamed he was capable of superstardom . <P> Now , in a burst of discovery , the U.S. record-buying public is making it up to Croce . You Do n't Mess Around with Jim ( ABC Records ) , his first solo LP , has tripled its sales since his death and has just jumped past the 1 million mark . Last week it was No. 1 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the No. 2 position with I Got a Name , recorded only a week before his death . As if that were not enough , at No. 22 was a third Croce album , Life and Times ( released in January 1973 ) . Sales like that are enough to turn the fortunes of almost any record company around - which indeed has happened to the languishing ABC Records . <P> Is the Croce boom based on anything more than morbid or cult curiosity ? The answer is yes . Croce had the gift to sing evocatively about a genuine slice of life : the young working class of Middle America . It was a milieu he knew firsthand , having left it only at an age when most pop stars are either fading or forever gone . <P> Croce was anything but a prodigy . He was born in Philadelphia in January 1943 . Music did not really interest him seriously until his days at Villanova University , but even then he took a degree in psychology ( 1965 ) and spent much of the time thereafter doing construction work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life on the open road in a broken-down rig : <P> You know the rain may blow <P> The snow may snow <P> The turnpikes they may freeze <P> But they do n't bother ole Speedball <P> He goin ' any damn way he please . <P> When he took his blue collar off it was to try to make it in the music business . New York 's Not My Home tells about the period in 1968 and 1969 when he and his wife Ingrid were dogging the campus and coffeehouse trail as a duo : <P> Lived there ' bout a year and I never <P> once felt at home <P> I thought I 'd make the big time <P> I learned a lot of lessons awful quick . <P> Giving it up , Jim and Ingrid settled down in 1970 in Lyndell , Pa. , where their son Adrian , now two , was born . One by one , Croce sold the guitars he had accumulated , and when the guitars were gone , he went back into construction work . Occasionally he got studio jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' aahs ' for commercials , " he once recalled . " I kept thinking , maybe tomorrow I 'll sing some words . "
