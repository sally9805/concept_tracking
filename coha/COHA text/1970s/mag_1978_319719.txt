A French connection-maybe <P> Can putting together two weaknesses make a strength ? Profit-pinched American Motors Corp . has been openly looking for a foreign carmaker with which to form some kind of partnership . Last week AMC revealed the company that it is focusing on-not , as rumored , Peugeot , but the French government-owned Renault-and the terms of a " proposed affiliation " that left a great deal for AMC stockholders to desire . <P> The pact is very tentative : basically , a commitment to try to work out a formal deal . If concluded , that deal would combine the two companies ' selling efforts in the U.S. ( American Motors cars would appear in Renault showrooms and vice versa ) and provide for sales of AMC Jeeps by Renault dealers overseas . Most important , Renault cars might be built in AMC plants . There are even some hints that the two companies might get together on designing a new car . <P> Such cooperation would clearly benefit both companies , but only to a limited extent . AMC Jeeps have been selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce Japanese competition . Making Renault 's small , 32-m.p.g . Le Car would help AMC get the m.p.g. average of its total fleet high enough to meet tough federal standards . But Renaults have not sold well in America ; they seem unlikely to draw much traffic to AMC dealer showrooms . Above all , Renault would put no money into cash-short AMC . If this is the best deal American Motors can come up with , it is still in trouble .
