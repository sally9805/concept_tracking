LIVES OF GIRLS AND WOMEN by ALICE MUNRO 250 pages . McGraw-Hill. $6.95 . <P> <P> Despite this young Canadian 's conventional disclaimer that her novel is " autobiographical in form but not in fact , " the pleasure to be taken from it comes from its fidelity to things as we imagine they really were . The book is a fiction for people who like to read brittle , yellow clips from newspapers published in towns where they never lived , who like to look through the snapshot albums of imperfect strangers . <P> Alice Munro uses a narrator named Del Jordan . She tells of growing to college age in the 1940s , in rural Canada , in the town of Jubilee , where a girl could count on hearing the names and the voices of friends on the local radio . Del looks back on her girlhood from the vantage of womanhood , and her memory has reduced rather than inflated the markers in her past . <P> She is the bright one in her family , the one destined to break out of Jubilee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and all . Her mother collaborates in the escape . Mrs. Jordan sells encyclopedias , takes correspondence courses- " Great Thinkers of History " - and writes letters to the local newspaper . She is sick from a nearly fatal dose of soured dreams . Her ambitions for her daughter are at once generous and bitter , a self-fulfillment and self-reproach . Those ambitions are nearly " sabotaged by love . " During her final year in Jubilee , Del is taken up by the equivalent of Lady Chatterley 's gamekeeper , and seems bound to surrender herself to his hedged circumstances and vision . " Do you want to be the wife of a lumberyard worker ? " her mother asks . " Do you want to join the Baptists ' Ladies Aid ? " <P> The threads of this yarn are common enough stuff . What Alice Munro makes of it is rare . For Del , looking back , tries to get it all just right . Nostalgia does not dampen her account , nor contempt deface it . " People 's lives , in Jubilee as elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caves paved with kitchen linoleum . " <P> Del tells in an epilogue about the novel she meant to write , a romance of suicide , insanity , and extreme summers and winters . A catalogue of Jubilee 's objects . A street gazette . Del was once " somebody who believed that the only duty of a writer is to produce a masterpiece . " Whatever Miss Munro once was , she is not that somebody . Her achievement is small but fine . By her tact , and power to recall , select and reduce , she has translated Jubilee into a birthplace , or something more than the name of a town . Call it fiction ; praise it . <P> Geoffrey Wolff
