 | As the drug tide rolls on , more and more parents are searching for ways to protect their children ? ways not just to fend off the evil once it 's at hand , but to head it off before their youngsters reach the age of entrapment . Now , for the first time , a team of experts has made a surprising discovery which might well provide some answers . Evidence gathered by New York 's Training for Living Institute , during four years of intensive work with more than a thousand youthful drug users in the city and its suburbs , indicates that there is a strong link between narcotics and sexual anxiety . Confused and frightened by powerful new emotions , mistrusting their feelings , fearful of not measuring up as " real " men or women , many young people find escape from their sexual growing pains in drugs that calm them down , pep them up , or just turn off their minds . " Despite all the talk these days about sexual honesty , " says the Institute 's Dr. Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confuion and the same worries that developing sexulity has always caused . Only now there is a new peril . Drugs are available as a way out , and some young people ? not all or even most , but some ? will be attracted to them . " Actually , sex and drugs are bound up with the same basic problem that has always troubled boys and girls on the threshold of manhood and womanhood ? self-image . Kids today can reject middle-class values all they want , scoff at the so-called materialistic society , go anywhere , live any place . But wherever they go , whatever they do , they can not ever escape their feelings about themselves and their ideas of self-worth . " This is the very fabric of the problem . That is what we must take the greatest care to nurture if we would hope to keep children away from drugs . " Sexual anxiety is not , of course , the only reason increasing numbers of young people are turning to drugs . Dr. James L. Goddard , former head of the Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are an overly medicated , pill-happy nation . Other experts cite youngsters ' curiosity , boredom , pressure from friends , feelings of alienation ? either from society as a whole or from their peers . Which is not to ignore poverty , especially in the ghettos of big cities , where abject human misery can make drug abuse almost a way of life . As one investigator puts it , " If I had to live in a rat- and roach-infested flat , jammed six in a room , with no money or job or chance of improvement or escape , I 'd probably shoot heroin too . " Dr. Levy 's findings , unlike most others , offer concerned parents insight into common causes ? and through them , hopefully , to possible " cures . " If , indeed , large numbers of youngsters at the threshold of adolescence turn to drugs as an escape from their inner doubts and fears , one way to protect a boy or girl is to see that his understanding of sexuality ? and his attitude toward it ? is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his body and brain . In a word , sex education . But not of the birds-and-bees variety . In an era when many ? but by no means all ? young people become involved in sex long before they 've ever experienced , or can even understand , genuine love , the teaching of sex has to be far more forthright than in earlier days . If it 's to be an effective weapon against drugs , guidance has to start early and encompass not only the physiology of intercourse and reproduction , but the emotional factors ? the drives and hungers and sensations of sex . And especially the difference between sexual attraction and genuine love . Without this background , youngsters are a poor match for the mounting sexual pressures of adolescence . It 's then that some of them turn to pills and pot ? and sometimes even heroin . Dr. Levy describes how one problem feeds the other : " For those kids who feel their problems insurmountable , the drug scene seems a great alternative . Once they become involved in it , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : how high they were yesterday , how high they are right now , how high they 're going to get tomorrow . All their psychic energy and all their waking time is concerned with drug behavior . Now they do n't have to cope with what is for them an uncharted , bewildering , scary thing  | come suddenly into their lives ? their own sexuality . They do n't have to risk bad performance or worry about whether they can make it ' ; they do n't have to suffer pangs of guilt for what they have done or feel bad that they are n't out there doing what the other kids are doing . With drugs , the guilt and internal pressures subside and the world looks good . They make themselves believe that what they 're doing is right and fun , and that those others out there are just squares . " Two histories from the bulging files of the Training for Living Institute are illuminating . They show that not only sexual encounters , but also the lack of them can trigger a flight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Rick , an intelligent boy who was heading for an engineering career . The youngest of four sons , Rick was shy , a loner , a poor athlete . At 17. he had never dated and felt uncomfortable at the few parties he went to . He tried to act blase about girls ( " Who needs them ? " he 'd say airily ) , but the truth was that he was scared to death of them and did n't understand why he was scared . Dreading a turndown if he should ask a girl out , he also dreaded the possibility that she 'd say yes . And so he did nothing . The tales of conquests he heard from other boys at school intensified his isolation and selfdoubt . Finally , convinced he 'd " never be able to make it with girls " ? even though he 'd never given himself the chance to find out ? he gave up on himself . Pill-popping and pot-smoking became his way out . Barbara , on the other hand , joined the drug scene as the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an affluent suburban high school , she and her boy friend began experimenting with sex when she was barely 15 and in no way ready for what she was doing . Nor was her partner . It 's hard to say which of them was more upset by their initial encounters , but the boy tried to brazen it out by blaming her for his failure . She , accepting the blame , resolved to try to do better . Practice did not make perfect . To make matters worse for Barbara , her boy friend accused her of " not caring any more " and began dating other girls . That was when 15-year-old Barbara started thinking of herself as an " inadequate woman " and easing the fear and hurt by way of marijuana and " uppers " and " downers " and whatever else she could get hold of . She would fortify herself with a pill before each date and would carry a dozen or so in her purse , " just in case . " " Sex is supposed to be great , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . I must be some kind of a queer ! " Members of the institute 's team meet many Barbaras . If they talk at all about love and affection ( and Barbara did ) , it 's not in terms of a long-lasting commitment , but of here and now . " Mostly ,  | though , " says Dr. Levy , " it 's not love they talk about , but sex . And sex unrelated to any lasting emotion . This is astounding when you first hear it from a 15- or 16-year-old . You get a detailed recital of precisely what they do together in their intimate moments , but you do not hear : I really love him and I want to share my life with him . ' " Sex among teen-agers. the Levy group found , can only be described as shallow and loveless . " These kids , " Dr. Levy declares , " talk about sex in the same way they talk about drugs ? you 're high , then the chemical wears off and the feeling is gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fond memories , no remembrances of a wonderful human relationship , no wish to repeat the experience with the same person . " Is it any wonder , given this " standard " as an introduction to sex , that many girls grow up hating and distrusting men ? In her new book , Drugs , Sex , Parents , and You , Dr. Judianne Densen-Gerber , a psychiatrist and lawyer who has worked with drug abusers and addicts for many years at Odyssey House , writes of a group discussion she had with 30 addicted girls , 17 years of age and younger : " Only four of them were still virgins , and of the other 26 , one had started sexuality as young as 12 . I had never in my life heard such hatred for the male . Because of what these girls have experienced with men , they were n't able to integrate sexuality into their own personality structure . They have n't developed any concept of the male that sees him as a life partner , a helpmate , someone to share with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they resolve their con- flicts about the male and resolve their basic distrust . " On the basis of sex as a purely physical act and nothing more , both boys and girls , predictably enough . employ drugs in a sad . sick ? and futile ? pursuit of increasingly heightened sexual sensation . " What frightens me as a psychologist , " Dr. Levy says , " is that the emotionality of these young people seems to be blunted too soon . Their reaction is , ' Well , we 've had sex , so what else is new ? ' The kick they thought was there has now diminished . They turn to drugs in the belief that one chemical or another can enhance the sex experience and thus provide new kicks . " Scientists point out that , in the long run , reliance on drugs to heighten the sex experience almost certainly leads to the opposite ? diminished sexual appetite and abilities , even impotence . No less than girls , boys , too , are having to tangle with the " new dimensions " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many boys , ultimately impelling a number of them toward drugs as a way of escaping it . Just as Barbara felt she " was n't a woman " because she could not satisfy her date , the Training for Living workers found that boys get the feeling they " are n't men . " This has come about because younger women , especially , no longer feel bound by traditional standards of " female sexuality " versus " male sexuality . " The double standard .. : 7 a ! ! ! f f a e ! a a a ? 0 a 4 e a f . ' e ! aa44arffi4 ? .4 , a. *** 4ala 7affiO4 ! ? u41=7laass4 ! ! t ! ama laa ? 4 ?

" Refusing to accept the strictly male orientation of earlier years , some sexually active girls are now making the demands , " Dr. Levy says . " That means that now a sexually active boy has to satisfy his girl on a date . What does that mean to an adolescent , and how does it affect him ? " Failing to understand his own psychic mechanisms in terms of human relations , in terms of love , in terms of genuine commitment , such a boy will measure himself solely in terms of physical performance . When he falls short of his ? and his date 's ? expectations , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a man should be , he thinks he 's not a " real man . " He worries ; he casts about for help . And he finds drugs which , he hears from drug users , can help him prolong the sex act and avoid obvious failure . His dependence on drugs is no longer an escape ? but a trap as well . Given the results of the institute 's study ? and bearing in mind that they apply not to hard-core addicts but to young people of generally privileged backgrounds who have turned to drugs for the specific reasons cited ? what can parents do to help their children grow up with a healthy sense of their own sexuality , thereby providing a strong line of defense against drugs ? The answer is easy enough : Make sure they receive sound , objective information about sexual behavior ; make sure they understand that their sexual feelings and drives are perfectly normal . Accomplishing these goals , though , is not easy . Dealing with children about sexual matters is an emotion-charged situation , one many parents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . To help them in their attempts , here are basic guidelines from educators and mental-health experts on how to go about it : 1 . Keep lines of communication open . Too often , parents and their children lose touch with each other through the years . With little real contact when it comes to less personal subjects , the chance for meaningful talk about sex becomes remote . So the lines of verbal communication must be set up early and kept open . Try always to respect your child 's opinions and feelings , however misguided or silly they may seem . Dismissing these beliefs out of hand will only breed resistance to talking about them ? in fact , might even reinforce them . Says Dr. Levy , " A youngster who has been repeatedly told all through his pre-teen years that he was wrong , or did n't know what he was talking about , or that he should listen to people who are older and wiser than he is , is n't likely to approach those same founts of all wisdom when he 's troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Help your child develop a healthy attitude toward his own body . A simple , clear understanding of the human body and its natural functioning is vital if sexual hang-ups of one kind or another are to be avoided . A child should be comfortable with his own body , unashamed of any part of it . Too often , well-meaning but misguided parents can transmit their own sexual fears by sending out signals : a slap on the hand or a sharp rebuke when a youngster is caught exploring himself ; a turning away or a " never mind " reply when asked about sex organs ; vague or evasive answers to questions prompted by curiosity or the early stirrings of sexuality . Dr. Levy 's advice : " Talk sense to your child . Be simple , factual and unpreachy in telling him what he wants to know about himself and the differences between the sexes . Proper labeling of body parts is a must . Be specific . A penis is a penis , not a dingaling . Breasts are breasts and not some cutesy substitute . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sown in the early years . It is then that the child begins to develop an attitude toward his own body as well as others ' . 3 . Tune in , not out , on your child 's period of adolescence . Dr. Roy W. Menninger , of the famous Topeka clinic , once wrote : " Our adult society tends to regard the adolescent as an unfortunate inconvenience , a sort of bad moment that we half wish would go away . . . a kind of incidental way-station in life which will surely pass if we wait long enough or hold our breath or look the other way . " Other authorities agree : Adolescence is indeed the worst period for both generations . And yet , there is perhaps no other time when children need their parents more . If it will help , read a good book on puberty ; bone up on its bewildering body changes , its turbulent emotions and unpredictable behavior . Show your child that you understand this period of intense conflict , this time of searching and questioning . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles in clothing and hair . Again , avoid sermonizing . Above all , do not turn your back upon any need or concern your child may have . 4 . Talk sense about sex . The way you pass along sex information is often more important than what you actually say . Since sex involves much more than biological and physiological functions alone , discussion of its powerful emotional forces becomes a critical matter . One possible approach is offered by the executive director of the Sex Information and Education Council of the U.S. " Sex is you , " Dr. Mary Calderone says . It involves something you are , not just something you do . You must learn to understand your sexuality so that you can respect it , appreciate it and use it properly at the right time of life . Sex is not reproduction and it 's not intercourse , although both are part of it . Sex is what it is to be a man or a woman . " Since a healthy attitude toward one 's own sexuality involves complex psychological factors ? so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points might be stressed this way : A healthy sexuality , you might say , means knowing how you feel about yourself and about other people . It means not feeling mixed up , frightened , guilty or inadequate as a man or woman . It means entering into a relationship only after coming to a decision about what you want for you , with a sensible , mature realization of what it will mean to you and the other person , including a willingness to accept responsibility for your own actions . It means cherishing a set of personal standards which have been formed only after a careful self-examination of your own feelings and attitudes . When it comes to choosing books on sexuality and explaining them to your child , your local mental-health center , public library or clergyman can offer suggestions .

What they can offer in discussions with their children are their own strongly held beliefs . At the same time . with life-styles and codes of conduct changing so rapidly , a giveand-take approach is imperative . Wellinformed on the facts about sex and its powerful emotional undercurrents , youngsters will be better prepared to make wise decisions about their own lives and actions . With that foundation , chances are that youngsters will be less inclined toward confusion and intimidation about sex , less likely to become involved with the tragedies drugs so often entail .
