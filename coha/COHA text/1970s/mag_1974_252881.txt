Henry Wiggen is a winner-a blond-and-blue-eyed All-America baseball hero , golden , graceful and uncomplicated . Julian Weston is a maggot-pale homosexual prostitute , strung out like a taut wire between self-inflicted denigration and a yearning for clean , well-lighted love . What these totally disparate characters-the one in John Hancock 's film Bang the Drum Slowly , the other in English Playwright John Hopkins ' Broadway drama Find Your Way Home - have in common is the very uncommon talent of Actor Michael Moriarty , who plays them both . With the release of the film in August and the opening of the play last month , Moriarty has emerged as one of the top young actors in the U.S. <P> Moriarty is among a handful of young stars who dominate the recent spate of " masculine mystique " movies - Al Pacino ( Serpico , Scarecrow ) , Robert De Niro ( Bang the Drum , Mean Streets ) , Harvey Keitel ( Mean Streets ) , Martin Sheen ( Badlands ) . They are nei ther heroic nor antiheroic leading men but character actors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage-oriented discipline of craftsman ship and technique . Moriarty is not really a " natural talent , " observes Donald Schoenbaum , managing director of Minneapolis ' Tyrone Guthrie Theater , where Moriarty spent four seasons in repertory . " His talent is as much intellectual as it is natural . " <P> Unlike stardom , craftsmanship and technique do not happen overnight . Al though his watercolor-washed good looks belie it ( " You look ten ! " said Katharine Hepburn , his co-star in the recent television version of The Glass Menagerie ) , the 32-year-old Moriarty has been working hard in the profession for 15 years . " For a long while , " he says wryly , " I felt like a barren tree . I knew there were a lot of creative juices inside of me and yet nothing was happening . Then in 1973 I finally bore fruit . Boy , did I ever ! It was hanging all over me ! " <P> A shy , withdrawn Detroit teenager , Moriarty was hooked by a high school production of Arsenic and Old Lace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " It was a 24-hour obsession . " <P> His career got off to a breezy start . <P> After graduating from Dartmouth , he won a Fulbright scholarship to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art . Moreover , Joseph Papp , one of the Fulbright judges , immediately cast him in his first professional role-as Octavius in a New York Shakespeare Festival production of Antony and Cleopatra . " I was a bonus baby , " recalls Moriarty , " just like in baseball . I was a raw young talent with little technique and a lot of gall based on very weak foundations-which started to crumble when I got to England . "
