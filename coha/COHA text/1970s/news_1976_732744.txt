txt President Ford 's chief assertions in debate with Jimmy Carter Wednesday are expected to be : ? That for the first time in years the United States is at peace . ? That he would keep the United States strong by increasing the defense budget while Democrat Carter would weaken the nation 's global position by cutting defense $5 billion to $7 billion . ? That his opponent is completely inexperienced in foreign affairs . The FOrd camp is baffled by the pre-debate briefing on defense matters which Mr. Carter received from former Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger .

Kennedy did with his allegation of a missile gap back in the 1960 debates ? charging that the U.S. , under President Ford , is slipping in the arms race ? Will he charge that the Ford-Kissinger negotiations with the Soviets have been to the disadvantage of the U.S. ?

Further , should he establish himself as being the hawk in the debate , does n't that damage Mr. Carter among a great many Democrats , particularly among the liberals ? Other points President Ford is likely to make are reflected in Henry Kissinger 's recent speech before the United Nations . He said : ? " The United States believes that the future of mankind requires coexistence with the Soviet Union . We will insist that restraint be reciprocal not just in bilateral relations but around the globe . There can be no selective detente . " ? " The negotiations on the limitation of armaments are at the heart of U.S.-Soviet relations . Unprecedented agreements limiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic effort is being made to place a ceiling on the strategic arsenals of both sides in accordance with the Vladivostok accord . And once this is achieved we are ready to seek immediately to lower the levels of strategic arms . " ? ? " Racial injustice and the grudging retreat of colonial power have conspired to make southern Africa an acid test of the- world 's hope for peace and justice under the UN Charter . . . . An opportunity to pull back from the brink now exists . "
