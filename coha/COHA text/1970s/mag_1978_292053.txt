The painter was an illusion <P> At least seven C.J. Fox portraits of bygone legislators hang in House committee rooms in Washington . A C.J. Fox painting of Brothers Charles and William Mayo is in Washington 's National Portrait Gallery . In fact , the name C.J. Fox adorns the mediocre likenesses of hundreds of wealthy and famous Americans , both living and dead . They include Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis , President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert , Publisher William Randolph Hearst , Oilman H.L. Hunt , FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover , AFL-CIO President George Meany and Francis Cardinal Spellman . <P> At up to $7,000 apiece , the portraits are not cheap works of art . Nor were they painted by C.J. Fox , as was disclosed last week in a U.S. tax court in Miami by an extraordinary entrepreneur named Leo Fox . <P> In a sworn affidavit filed as part of his fight against an Internal Revenue Service bill for $40,000 in back taxes , he said that the " C.J. Fox " paintings he has sold since the 1940s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , admitted Fox , an obscure Manhattan artist named Irving Resnikoff , 81 , turned out 139 " Foxes " - all from photographs of the subjects-for a fee of $250 to $300 apiece . By his own admission , Fox could not have done the portraits if he tried : he can not paint . <P> Sly Leo Fox , now in his 60s , pulled off his illusory act with remarkable ease . As part of his sales pitch , he circulated a brochure describing the imaginary Fox as the son of a well-known Austrian artist whose " guidance and expert tutelage was the son 's inspiration . " Fox portraits were always done from photographs , and sold as such . After a few well-placed sales , Fox 's reputation spread by word of mouth . Said he : " I learned a way of being a good salesman . I do n't steal from the poor . " He even won some high praise . Ethel Kennedy wrote to say that she had been " moved " by his portrait of J.F.K. and was " looking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Wilber M. Brucker called his own portrait " a tribute to both your artistic skill and powers of observation . " <P> So far , none of Fox 's clients has made any complaint . And Judge Samuel Sterrett will not decide for several weeks whether the real Fox owes $40,000 to the IRS.
