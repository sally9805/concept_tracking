Out one window Santa Catalina , the Island of Romance , was clearly visible in the blue Pacific , and out the other Terry Harper could see Little Leaguers practicing to become DPHs , housewives and stewardesses trying to imitate Billie Jean King and a collection of bleached beach bums playing basketball with a volleyball . For Harper , the view from his oceanside bungalow in Manhattan Beach , Calif. is a thousand sights better than the tons of snow that surrounded him during the 10 years he played and lived in Montreal ; nevertheless , he has a mild complaint . " How , " Harper asks , " do you get yourself in the mood to play hockey when you can spend the afternoon romping around the beach ? It does n't make much sense . " // In a valiant attempt to obliterate the pleasures of a rare smogless afternoon from his mind and , instead , psych himself up for the game the Los Angeles Kings would play against the New York Rangers last Wednesday night , Harper collected a few logs and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold around here , " he said to his wife Gladys , who nodded in agreement . // Cold ? It was 68 ? . But the fire soon flamed out , and then Harper got up , put on his bathing suit , strolled down to the beach and did his psyching during a long , barefoot walk along the shore . // Before Coach Bob Pulford took over this year , flexing a whip , and Harper showed up with some Canadien charisma , the Kings generally spent more time at the beach and on the golf course than they did on the ice , and they easily managed to miss the Stanley Cup playoffs the last three seasons . The Kings were probably driven to the surf by the terrible trades concocted by Owner Jack Kent Cooke and General Manager Larry Regan , not to mention the turnstile arrival and departure of King coaches . Besides disposing of such dependable players as Bill White and Dale Rolfe , Cooke and Regan also contrived to trade away every No. 1 draft pick the Kings have had in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Regan finally made a couple of shrewd moves . They persuaded Pulford , the former Toronto forward who played out the last two years of his career with the Kings , to become coach , and lured the 33-year-old Harper west . And now the team seems headed for the playoffs in the madcap West Division . After letting the Rangers escape with a 4-4 tie and then splitting with Vancouver and Toronto last week , the Kings had a firm hold on fourth place . Better yet , the NHL schedule now turns in their favor . // " We 'll be all right , because starting in February we play 18 of our last 25 games in California , and we 're a warm-weather club , " says Ralph Backstrom , another former Canadien , who already has scored 18 goals for the Kings . Indeed , the Kings have lost only four of 21 games at home . But they have squandered 17 of 25 in colder climates . " We travel more than 80,000 miles this season , at least twice the distance of the teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets to you , " says Harry Howell , still another veteran who is finishing his career in Los Angeles . " It 's so cold back East we never leave the hotels . " // To prepare for his coaching duties , Pulford spent 10 days last summer with George Allen at the Washington Redskin training camp in Carlisle , Pa . " George taught me that you do n't go anywhere by the seat of your pants , " Pulford says . " I learned that a little positive psychology will go a long way . After all , what 's so wrong with saying that you 've got the 10th best something-or-other  --  even though it may also be the sixth worst . " // Like Allen , Pulford concentrates on every little thing . He is the only coach in the NHL who takes a clipboard onto the ice for practice sessions . " When I was with Montreal and we played the Kings it usually was a pretty wide-open game because they were n't very well organized , " Harper says . " Pulford has put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you do n't play his way , then you do n't play . " // For Harper , who was on five Stanley Cup championship teams during his decade as a defenseman-bouncer for the Canadiens , it has been an unexpectedly satisfying season . For one thing , he was voted to the All-Star team for the first time in his career . More important , his experience has helped the younger Los Angeles defensemen , particularly Gilles Marotte , eliminate mistakes that used to result in goals for the opposition . Marotte has played so well that he also was voted to the All-Star team . " Someone like Harper can help turn your whole club around , " Pulford says . // Nevertheless , Harper was hardly thrilled last summer when Sammy Pollock , general manager of the Canadiens , called and asked if he would talk to Cooke on the phone . " I was n't happy in Montreal and I wanted to get away , " Harper says , " but I did n't want to get 3,000 miles away . I was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because if the Canadiens did not send me where I wanted to go I was planning to jump to the WHA . " Harper told Pollock the Kings were " too bad a team " and that he was not interested in talking to Cooke . Then Cooke called Harper and invited him to Los Angeles . // " I went , " Harper says , " and by the time Cooke finished talking and I finished listening I was sold completely . " Once the season began , though , the Kings lost six of their first seven games and Harper asked himself , " What have I done to deserve this ? " But then the Kings set off on a winning streak , moving temporarily into first place in the West  --  and Harper has had no doubts since . // Like Howell , Backstrom and Pulford , Harper has had difficulty adjusting to the California life-style . " My clothing bills are way down because the kids wear sneakers , jeans , T shirts and no socks everyplace they go , including school , " Harper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the kids . Jeffrey , who is seven , was one step from being a devil back in Montreal but now he complains that his teachers are n't strict enough with him . " Jeffrey plays hockey a few days a week at the rink in Culver City where the Kings normally practice , but he and his older brother Greg , 11 , have discovered there are other sports  --  like swimming , surfing , basketball , tennis and volleyball . Harper has , too . " See those courts over there , " he said last week , pointing to an area about 100 yards from his rented bungalow . " Gladys and I play tennis several times a week . In Montreal I used to ski up in the Laurentians , on my off-days only . " Gladys laughed . " And you were n't supposed to do that , either , because it was against club rules . " // Harper suspects that only his immediate neighbors know who he is and who the Los Angeles Kings are . " It 's so different , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can go to a restaurant out here and dine in peace . In Montreal you did n't bother to go out very often , because it was a hassle . " // " Oh , you 've had the glory already , do n't worry about it , " Gladys said . " I feel sorry for the young kids on the Kings , though . It must be tough on them . They are something big back home , but out here nobody knows them . They have never had the glory . " Maybe not , but if the Kings do make the playoffs Los Angeles hockey could develop the snob appeal it has never had , even though the Kings are averaging almost 10,000 fans a game . " What we need , " Harper says , " is a great playoff series against one of the old teams . Then everyone out here would know what hockey is all about . "
