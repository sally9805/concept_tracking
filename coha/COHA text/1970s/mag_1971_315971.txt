JUST five weeks after they plunged confidently into the jungles of Laos , the best troops of South Viet Nam were engaged last week in a perilous and bloody battle to get out . Whether Operation Lam Son 719 , as the Laotian invasion is officially called , could be judged a success or a setback was still a matter of considerable debate ( see box next page ) . Beyond debate , however , was the fact that some units of the South Vietnamese army ( ARVN ) had been badly cut up in the fighting , and that North Viet Nam seemed ready and willing to sacrifice casualties by the thousands in order to deal the South a physical and psychological mauling . <P> That the ARVN withdrawal was not yet a rout was due very largely to U.S. airpower . Day after day , B-52s , F-4 Phantoms and F-100s , flying as many strike sorties for the Lam Son operation alone as they ordinarily stage in all of Indochina , kept the battlefield under incessant barrage . Giant B-52s , used like Phantom jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle and elephant grass , dropping their 30,000-lb. bomb loads as close as 600 yards to allied positions . Everywhere ARVN soldiers went , they stumbled upon phalanxes of enemy bodies , or survivors walking about in a daze , talking of " death from the sky . " <P> Going Nowhere . Still , the North Vietnamese pressed their attack on the ARVN troops-or at least some of them . The withdrawal from Laos was in fact divided into three fairly distinct parts , and Washington still maintained that it would not be completed until mid-April . According to the Pentagon , several thousand of the 20,000 South Vietnamese who went into Laos were sweeping southeastward toward home , hilltop hopping by helicopter and disrupting enemy supply routes . Some 10,000 more ARVN troops , whose armored column had been stalled for five weeks on Route 9 , 15 miles inside Laos , began a slow creep back toward the border . <P> The real battle-and the most precipitous retreat-involved the elite 1st ARVN Division . They had been assigned to man fire bases named Sophia , Lolo , Liz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooking the invasion route on Highway 9 . All were abandoned after undergoing continued shelling and massed attacks by the North Vietnamese . The ARVN troops destroyed their own artillery and fought their way through the jungle until helicopters could reach them ( see following story ) . <P> Crowded Helicopters . One of the 1st Division 's three regiments-the 3rd-returned with only 450 of its original 2,000 men still in fighting condition . For those troops at least , the orderly retreat had become a rout . Choppers that ordinarily accommodate eight men carried 14 , some clinging precariously to the helicopter skids . Several lost their holds in mid-air and fell to death ; others seemed barely able to hobble , apparently suffering from their days of marching through Laos ' jungled mountains . One unconscious soldier had one arm wrapped around a machine-gun mount , while his comrades held him from inside the chopper ; as the craft touched down , they let go , and he fell to the ground in a heap . A young U.S. adviser , watching from a Jeep , held the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ROGERS : LAOS DRIVE A SUCCESS . His comment : " Sure , and here come the victors . "
