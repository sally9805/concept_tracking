PADRE PADRONE <P> Directed and Written by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani <P> It is a weird but persistent paradox : some brilliant movies are sheer torture to sit through . Such is the case with Padre Padrone , the Italian television film that last spring became the first movie ever to win both the grand prize and the international critics ' prize at the Cannes Festival . Padre Padrone has undeniable merits ; it tells a fascinating true-life story in an innovative style . Yet somehow it never makes us care passionately about its people or its subject . Though there is reason to believe that this film will influence other films , many moviegoers may forget Padre Padrone as soon as they leave the theater . <P> The movie is an adaptation of a remarkable autobiography by Gavino Ledda , a poor Sardinian shepherd 's son who grew up to become an accomplished linguist . Ledda , now in his mid-30s , spent his formative years in almost total isolation and ignorance . Yanked out of school at age six by his tyrannical father , he lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he turned 20 . Only when he escaped to the Italian army did he discover the pleasures of literacy , industrialized civilization and social intercourse . In Padre Padrone ( English title : My Father , My Master ) , we see how Ledda overcame his punishing childhood and the cultural heritage of centuries to seize a life of intellectual endeavor . To their credit , Paolo and Vittorio Taviani , the brothers who directed the film , do not sentimentalize material that could easily collapse into bathos . <P> Padre Padrone unfolds in brief and often brutal bursts of drama that are more reminiscent of Godard movies than of anthropological documentaries ; the film 's unsettling rhythm is meant to echo the primitive manners of the society it describes . Even more startling is the Tavianis ' extravagant use of sound to intensify and comment upon the film 's pivotal incidents . When , for instance , the hero first experiences sex ( in the form of bestiality ) , the panting of a chorus of unseen copulators overwhelms the action . Later , a moment of incongruous accordion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's liberation from the enforced silence of his youth . While the film is vibrantly photographed and generally well acted ( notably by Omero Antonutti as the father and Fabrizio Forte as the young Ledda ) , the sound track is the true star . <P> The Tavianis ' film-making techniques remain daring throughout , but Padre Padrone 's style finally proves to be not only the movie 's principal virtue but its undoing . The directors are too coldly rigorous in their efforts to remain aloof from the emotional content of their story : they place so large an intellectual distance between us and the characters that the gap becomes unbridgeable . That is why we admire Padre Padrone without being engaged by it , and care more about the filmmakers ' achievements than we do about what happens to the hero . Like other such oddities as Resnais ' Last Year at Marienbad or Antonioni 's Zabriskie Point , Padre Padrone is a dead movie whose novel cinematic vocabulary will survive the corpse .                @ @ @ @ @
