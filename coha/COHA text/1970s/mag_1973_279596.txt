THE muffled thunder of outgoing artillery fire could be heard in Saigon up to the end-and after , as the fighting stubbornly rattled on . Yet , when the moment arrived at 8 a.m. last Sunday , the sound of sirens and church bells took over the teeming streets . Policemen whistled motorists and Honda drivers to a stop to observe a minute of silence for the 183,500 South Vietnamese troops who had died in battle since their country was created in the last Viet Nam settlement at Geneva 19 years ago . <P> Saigon 's streets were festooned with saffron and red flags and banners that declared VICTORY FOR SOUTH VIET NAM or , more convincingly , THE ENTIRE PEOPLE WELCOME THE CEASEFIRE . Yet there was no rejoicing , not even a sense of relief . Sunday , cease-fire or no , President Nguyen Van Thieu had decreed that all South Vietnamese civilians should go to their jobs as they would on a workday . The idea was to show that there was little to celebrate and that little had changed-a point Thieu made repeatedly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no peace yet , " he said . " This is only a standstill ceasefire . If the Communists commit small cease-fire violations , we will respond with small actions . If they commit big violations , we will respond with big actions . " <P> In Hanoi small groups gathered in the streets-under banners commanding them to SACRIFICE ALL RATHER THAN SUBMIT-to hear the cease-fire news from the same loudspeakers that had honked warnings of U.S. air attacks less than a month before . In contrast to Thieu , North Viet Nam 's leaders seemed ready-even eager-to admit that something had changed with the Paris agreement . At a presidential-palace reception , North Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong , 64 , had a smiling , two-word reply to a foreign diplomat who offered his congratulations : " At last ! " <P> Almost inevitably , the cease-fire was preceded by an awesome spasm of violence . Both sides used the 117 hours between the announcement of the agreement and the actual start of the cease-fire to seek last-minute military advantage . The grabbing added up to some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Thailand , Navy carriers offshore and the airbase at Bien Hoa , home of the last U.S. combat unit in Viet Nam ( see box ) , U.S. pilots flew record sorties in an effort to stop the Communist drive . The Viet Cong made some potentially significant last-minute gains , especially in strategically important Tay Ninh province northwest of Saigon , where government control of the provincial capital was seriously threatened . <P> The last hours of the Viet Nam War took a cruel human toll . Communist and South Vietnamese casualties ran into the thousands . Four U.S. airmen joined the missing-in-action list when their two aircraft were downed on the last day . Another four Americans were known to have been killed-including Lieut . Colonel William B. Nolde , 43 , of Mt . Pleasant , Mich. , who was cut down in an artillery barrage at An Loc only eleven hours before the ceasefire . He was the 45,941st American to have died by enemy action in Viet Nam since 1961.                @ @ @ @ @
