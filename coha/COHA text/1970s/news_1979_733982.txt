txt Reactions to the war in Cambodia from non-Communist neighbors in Southeast Asia have been surprisingly mild , even as the Hanoi-backed Cambodian rebel regime in Phnom Penh moved to consolidate its hold over the country . Although the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) are concerned that the conflict could spill over the border to Thailand or that remnants of the ousted Pol Pot forces might prolong the struggle , they have nevertheless adopted a " wait and see " policy . Meanwhile , Vietnamese diplomats in ASEAN , which groups together Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , and the Philippines , reportedly have begun reassuring leaders of those governments that they have no cause for concern . As though dovetailing these efforts , Hanoi 's official organ Nhan Dan declared , " This new era will see the three fraternal peoples of Vietnam , Laos , and Kampuchea ( Cambodia ) solidly united to build a new life with absolute respect for one another 's independence and sovereignty , and with equality and mutual assistance . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pushing . But some diplomatic detractors of Vietnam saw the seeds of one in it . However , many ASEAN diplomats do not see a Hanoi-dominated federation looming over their heads . // From page 1 Viet neiahbors take wait and see ' stance With the sole exception of Peking , there have been no open denunciations in Asia of Hanoi . Even North Korea , a close ally of China and the Pol Pot government has withheld comment . Japan , however , is considering freezing both its promised $70 million aid to Hanoi and some 150,000 tons of emergency rice supplies , at least until it reassesses the recent developments in Cambodia . According to a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman in Tokyo , the most troublesome factor was not the " fall of Phnom Penh itself but its repercussions on ASEAN . " ASEAN representatives began a meeting Jan. 8 in Jakarta , Indonesia , to assess the aftermath of the fall of the Pol Pot government . The meeting coincided with an interview given by Hanoi 's ambassador to Jakarta , Tran My , to the authoritative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed Pol Pot 's intransigence toward Hanoi for the recent events and declared that there was " no cause for concern to our friends in Southeast Asia . " Opening the ASEAN meeting , Indonesian Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja said Indonesia would like to call on the UN to take steps to end the fighting in Cambodia . ASEAN sources pointed out that the organization would not like to give an impression that it would be meddling in the conflict , preferring instead to remain neutral . In Bangkok , Thai Prime Minister Kriangsak Chamanan ruled out any possibility of ASEAN members taking any form of military action . Thailand , the front-line state bordering on Cambodia , will be discussing the situation with Japanese leaders next week , when General Kriangsak visits Tokyo on a scheduled trip , he said . Tengku Ahmed Rithauddeen , the foreign minister of Malaysia , the ASEAN country with the closest ties with Hanoi , merely expressed concern over the situation and said his country is " watching the situation closely . " The Philippines Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile said the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the region . Manila would adopt an attitude of " wait and see , " since it had friendly ties with both Vietnam and Cambodia , he added . Singapore , the most vocal anti-Communist ASEAN member , withheld official comment . But the daily Straits Times , which usually reflects government thinking , editorially criticized Hanoi and said the balance of power has shifted to the Moicow-Hanoi axis . On the other hand , it had no kind word for Pol Pot either . The editorial mentioned the new rebel regime 's " impressive reform program . " Unless the West and Japan take stiff economic measures against Hanoi to deter it , the editorial went on , front-line states such as Thailand may be forced to compromise their neutrality by aligning with China . " If the Thais , for example do so , k ASEAN cohesion could be in jeopardy , " the editorial said . Clearly , Singapore does not want the entry of China into the foray . Echoing Singapore , another ASEAN diplomat commented : " We do n't want the conflict to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect the stability of the region . " If the Indo-China conflict is contained and Hanoi does not make menacing moves to threaten the non-Communist neighbors , ASEAN is likely to go along with the fait accompli in Cambodia .
