Possibly the biggest yet <P> Will the leaders of the next oil superpower be wearing sombreros instead of desert kaffiyehs ? Mexico became a net exporter of petroleum in 1975 as a result of discoveries of big deposits in the southern regions east of Veracruz , and since then , one leading U.S. energy analyst says enviously , " the Mexicans have been finding oil as fast as they put holes in the ground . " Last week Jorge Diaz Serrano , head of Pemex , the government oil monopoly , announced the discovery of a new field that he says may contain up to 100 billion bbl. ; that would be more than half as much as Saudi Arabia 's proven reserves , as well as the biggest single accumulation of oil in the Western Hemisphere . Although Mexico 's proven reserves are still formally pegged at a modest 20 billion bbl. , officials have long said that the actual total is far higher . <P> The latest strikes were made near the Gulf Coast city of Tampico in the Chicontepec field , where Mexican oil was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly discovered oil , which is located below tight , nonporous rock formations , will be difficult to bring to the surface , requiring 16,000 wells to be drilled over a period of perhaps 13 years . While the Mexicans do not belong to OPEC , they are able to exact a high price ( $13.10 per bbl. ) for the oil that they sell , most of which goes to the U.S. ; naturally they plan to step up production sharply . In fact they now hope to triple their oil exports to 1 million bbl. a day by 1980 . Though that is only about one-seventh of what the Saudis ship every day , it is impressive for a country that a few years ago was importing oil .
