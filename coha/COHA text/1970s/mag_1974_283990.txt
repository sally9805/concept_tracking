MY FAT FRIEND <P> by CHARLES LAURENCE <P> With apologies to the Gay Liberation movement , this funny and affectionately bitchy play might better have been called My Fag Friend . Lynn Redgrave is supposedly the star of the proceedings-a pathologically tubby bookstore owner who 1 ) outgrows muumuus as she miserably devours chocolates ; 2 ) meets and falls in love with an itinerant oil geologist ; 3 ) heroically goes off her feed in order to turn herself into what looks like a young Angela Lansbury , only to discover 4 ) that her lover , back from prospecting in Iran , actually prefers fat girls , whereupon 5 ) the cellulite freak abruptly departs and 6 ) a sadder but psychologically thinner Lynn sets out to face the future , like a reformed alcoholic with a missionary taste for Diet Pepsi . <P> That much of it amounts to one joke-and not an especially good one . The real star of the show-in fact , its only excuse- is George Rose , who plays Lynn 's magnificently swishy lodger Henry , a middle-aged queen mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of Henry 's preening , his outrageous , satiric gaiety , which has something quite likable about it . Rose , who looks here like a limp Morey Amsterdam , brings the fat farm drama alive . <P> My Fat Friend is abundant with laughs , although often of the kind that one instantly regrets having laughed : adolescent fat and fag jokes , even bathroom humor . Lynn Redgrave 's contribution amounts to shedding her padded underwear during half time and acting reasonably well , whenever she can forget Georgie Girl . But Rose is a lovely Rose . <P> Lance Morrow
