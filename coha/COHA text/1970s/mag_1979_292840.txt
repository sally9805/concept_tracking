AGATHA <P> Directed by Michael Apted Screenplay by Kathleen Tynan and Arthur Hopcraft <P> Ostensibly , Agatha is a fiction that attempts to fill in the lacunae in the historical record of one of this century 's least pressing but most fascinating enigmas : that ten-day period in 1926 when Agatha Christie , that shy and eminently respectable mystery writer , seemed to disappear off the face of the earth , becoming the object of a very noisy hue and cry in England before she was found , volunteering ( as she never did ) no explanation for the only untoward incident in her otherwise gray tweed life . Actually , the true subjects of this movie , based on a story by Co-Scenarist Tynan , are cloche hats , potted palms , brass-and wood-fitted motorcars and , above all , the manners , styles and quaint equipment to be found a half-century ago in an expensive health spa like the one where Christie went to ground . These Director Apted photographs with a dreamy yet intensely curious eye , and the result is a slow but curiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic house where one is led to romanticize the lives once led there . <P> This mood is encouraged by the story . It posits a dreadfully shy and innocent Christie hopelessly in love with her bumptiously philandering husband and so distraught over his affair with his secretary that she follows the woman to the spa . There the mystery writer plots , as neatly as she would one of her novels , a crime that will 1 ) put her out of her romantic misery and 2 ) wreak suitable vengeance on her husband and his mistress . This is as plausible as any other explanation of Christie 's disappearance , though no more persuasive than any other that might be dreamed up by a clever person confronting the puzzle . What is persuasive , or at least highly appealing , is the tentative , restorative relationship that develops between Christie and the American journalist who discovers her whereabouts and falls so deeply in love with her that he can not break the story . <P> Christie is played by Vanessa Redgrave , the American by Dustin Hoffman-a very odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to playing women rendered both vulnerable and awkward by the intensity of emotions that can not be fully expressed . She is lovely and touching . Hoffman 's character is based on a vanished type , the journalistic dandy of the Richard Harding Davis variety . He 's a man who travels with a dozen suitcases full of bespoke clothing , knows his way around menus and room clerks , has the air of a self-made man who is pleased with the job he did on himself . Also , of course , she is very tall and he is very short , a fact the movie cheerfully plays up to underscore the improbability of their attraction .
