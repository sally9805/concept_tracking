Sears sees the potential pickings best in the South ? including Missouri , Mississippi , South Carolina , Virginia , and Louisiana ? where the Ford challenger has good organizational support .

Also Mr. Reagan says that voters who have adopted a strong anti-Washington mood would consider his challenge of big government and big bureaucracy more legitimate than Mr. Carter 's . By Godfrey Sperling Jr . Staff correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor Washington Barring unforeseen difficulties , President Ford 's campaign forces believe they have won the nomination ? " that it 's all over . " Melvin R. Laird , a close political adviser of the President , told a group of reporters over breakfast that Mr. Ford ( now viewed in the GOP camp as leading challenger Ronald Reagan , 976 to 869 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 191 in the remaining 11 convention states ? making it 1,112 for Mr. Ford and 1,060 for Mr. Reagan ( 1,130 are needed to win ) . Then , says Mr. Laird , who consults closely with the Ford campaign committee in shaping strategy and is deeply involved in persuading uncommitted delegates : " We definitely go over the top with the uncommitted // *Ford optimistic // delegates . We have checked carefully and know that at least 75 percent of the remaining no- or so uncommitted delegates are going with the President . " So it appears that foremost in the presidential strategy is one of expressing supreme confidence in the outcome being in Mr. Ford 's favor . But , meanwhile , the President and his followers will be fighting tooth and nail to see to it that their optimism is fulfilled . Thus , Mr. Ford goes into the next convention state , Missouri , over the weekend to try to pick up as many of the delegates to be selected there as he can . Mr. Laird insists that his projection is " pessimistic - the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His table follows : Missouri - Reagan 34 , Ford 15 ( " Ford might well get more " ) ; Iowa - Reagan 16 , Ford 20 ; Minnesota - Reagan 12 , Ford 30 ( " We expect to do better there " ) . Washington - Reagan 38 , Ford 0 ; Delaware - Reagan 0 , Ford 17 ; New Mexico - Reagan 21 , Ford 0 ; Montana - Reagan 20 , Ford 0 . North Dakota - Reagan 9 , Ford 9 ; Colorado - Reagan 16 , Ford 15 ( " Reagan might get a few more here " ) ; Connecticut - Reagan 5 , Ford 30 ( " We might get all of them . " ) ; Utah - Reagan 20 , Ford 0 . Beyond presidential involvement in the convention states - or at least those in which he feels there is a chance that his presence could produce a few more delegates ( like Missouri , Minnesota , and Connecticut ) the Ford strategy will focus on wooing the uncommitted delegates . Mr. Laird says that he himself has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ready to support the President . " Reagan has gotten all he is going to get among most of those 100 to 125 delegates , " he says . Will the President actually be talking to some of the wavering " uncommitted ? " Deputy GOP campaign chairman James Barker told this same group the other day that the process would be carried on by campaign staff members . Mr. Baker will do much of it . But GOP Minority Leader John Rhodes has indicated that the President could well tart persuading personally . And observers here have commented that a president has a special advantage when he is the one who is making the phone call : It is very difficult for a Republican delegate to say " no " to the President of the United States , they say .
