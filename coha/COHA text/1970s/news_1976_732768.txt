txt Last June , Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns was trying to reassure a nervous Joint Economic Committee of Congress about the spring slowdown in consumer spending " Temporary pauses of this kind are n't uncommon during periods of cyclical expansion . " he said " There is good reason to believe that the recent slowdown will also be temporary " He added that sales figures that month " suggest that a resumption of the upward trend is already underway " Now , tour months later , the upward trend in consumer outlays is still awaited , and Mr. Burns and other Federal Reserve officials appear to be getting a little uneasy about the slow pace of the recovery . There is n't any indication of a major policy switch , but there are signs that the Fed intends to pour funds into the economy at a somewhat faster rate and , at least for the next few weeks , to try to prevent any significant rise in interest rates . " My guess would be that they are nudging a little toward ease , " says Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Mellon Bank " This has been a longer and more worrisome pause in business activity than most people had expected " " A Good Job " " I am assuming that Arthur Burns is n't going to try to run the unemployment rate any higher by restricting monetary growth too much , " says Robert Orthner , senior vice president and economist of Bank of New York ' ' Overall the Fed has done a very good job , and it is n't going to try to abort the recovery " The Fed 's monetary stance just now is of more than passing interest not only because of the lengthy economic pause but also because of the implications in a presidential election year In 1972 Mr Burns and the Federal Reserve were accused of speeding up money growth to help bolster the economy and assure Richard Nixon 's reelection The charges were denied Now , although the economy appears likely to remain sluggish through the election , the Federal Reserve has been staying close to its announced monetary targets ? apparently having no desire to run into such a controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisers have been sharply critical of the Federal Reserve , charging that its monetary goals are too restrictive . And some analysts suggest the Fed is trying to stay out of the political argument by leaning a bit in the challenger 's direction of monetary ease but avoiding any real change in policy . Monetary Figures The most commonly watched money-supply figure is the so-called Ml , defined as currency plus bank checking accounts . MI has bounced up and down in the past few weeks , leaving market analysts in doubt as to the Federal Reserve 's intentions . But the Fed last week moved aggressively to inject funds into the banks , with the immediate effect of pushing short-term interest rates below levels the system had preferred The money supply is considered a key influence on economic activity . In the past year Ml has grown at a rate somewhat below the bottom end of the Fed 's announced target range of 4%% to 7% a year . So Ml could grow considerably faster without over ' shooting the system 's targets But the Federal Reserve also watches M2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the past year M2 has grown at a rate above the top of the system 's target range of 7%% to 9 ? 4% a year . " When the spread between MI and M2 growth is wide , as it is now , the Fed has indicated that it pays more attention to ** says Leif H Olsen , senior vice president of Citibank So the move toward increased credit ease presumably is being taken with some reluctance Although the Fed this year has been staying close to its monetary targets , Mr Burns has said repeatedly that the Fed 's goals would have to be lowered progressively over the next few years to combat inflation The Fed 's current reluctance to speed up money growth may result partly from its expressed belief that the economic recovery will resume soon , putting upward pressure on interest rates . Fed 's Indirect Control The Fed does n't control money growth directly . Instead it provides the banks with reserves that the banks use to make loans and investments ? and create deposits , which add to the money supply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thM : -. ) , the rate on these " federal funds " is a key short-term rate . In setting policy , the Fed decides what federal-funds rate is consistent with the monetary growth it seeks . Lately , its target rate has been 514% . The system can largely set this rate for short periods by increasing or reducing the supply of federal funds . And since last week it has allowed fed funds to trade often at rates below 5% . The fed-funds rate strongly influences all other short-term rates , such as the rates on Treasury bills . " There has been a reluctance on the part of the Fed to see the short-term rates - go down , " says Allan H. Meltzer , CarnegieMellon University economist and a student of the Fed . " If they came down , the rise would be more pronounced when the recovery picked up speed , and the system . would n't like to see that happen just before the election . " Lacy H. Hunt , vice president and economist of Philadelphia 's Fidelity Bank , says that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The U.S. Treasury 's tax collections and spending have been the complicating factor in the past few weeks . Treasury balances have been unusually large . When they are in the Treasury 's account with the Fed , they do n't count as part of the money supply ; when the Treasury spends the money and the funds wind up in private accounts m commercial banks , they add to the supply The Fed . Mr Hunt says , has only partly offset the resulting buildup in the money supply The question for the next year , he continues . ? is whether the Fed will remain committed to its monetary targets If Gov . Carter is elected , there may be increased pressure to stress interest-rate targets , to stress keeping interest rates down " Mr Carter s chief economic adviser , Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania , said he would favor holding interest rates one percentage point below levels they would otherwise reach- and disregard the targets for money-supply growth Mr Klein heads the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates at Pennsylvania , and this organization now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its monetary targets in 1977 to keep interest rates from rising steeply Robert Parks , chief economist of the brokerage firm of Advest Co . thinks that the current sluggishness in the economy will persist in the first half of next year- and this alone will compel the Fed to exceed its money-supply targets Other economists , however , are convinced that Fed officials will remain committed to the monetary targets " They 're a little like the old Cleveland Browns defensive unit , " one analyst suggests " They may bend , but they wo n't break " " I think their policy continues to be gradually cutting down on the rate of monetary growth to effect a lowering of the inflation rate . " A Gary Shilling , chief economist of the brokerage firm of White , Weld &; Co , says . " Right now the Fed , like most people , thinks the economy Is n't living up to expectations . But over the longer term , its first target is inflation " Michael Evans , president of Chase Econometric Associates , the forecasting affiliate of Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M2 will be less of a problem next year He believes that a stronger economy to 1977 will lead to higher short-term interest rates " As long as short-term interest rates are around 5% " he suggests , " a pays to shift money into bank savings accounts , increasing M2 . When short-term interest rates move up , it will limit the growth of M2 " In any case , there seems little question that Arthur Burns and other Federal Reserve officials will be glad to have next month 's election behind them . Mr Burns had been expected to testily on monetary policy before the Senate Banking Committee late this month . By agreement with the committee , the testimony has been postponed until after the election .
