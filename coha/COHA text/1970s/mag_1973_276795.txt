Do you ever dream , my sweetheart , <P> Of a twilight long ago , <P> Of a park in old Kalgoorlie <P> Where the bougainvillaeas grow ? <P> - Herbert Hoover <P> The miners of Kalgoorlie 's Golden Mile knew Herbert Hoover before the turn of the century as a young gold-mining engineer and balladeer in love with a local barmaid . Today Kalgoorlie is a nickel-mining center of 26,000 , with 37 saloons , tolerated brothels and streets still wide enough to turn a horse team around . It is a part of a vast interior that few Australians ever see , since four-fifths of the country 's 13 million people live in coastal cities . Together with such other way stations as Cookamidgera , Ivanhoe , Broken Hill , Bookaloo , Tarcoola , Koolyanobbing and Doodlakine , Kalgoorlie forms a new standard-gauge rail link across the continent . This single 2,461-mile track now connects swinging Sydney on the Pacific with tranquil Perth on the Indian Ocean . While the U.S. is cutting back on trains , Australia just added a third weekly transcontinental express in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports : <P> Pulling out of Sydney 's ancient Central Station at 3:15 p.m. , the Indian-Pacific glides through a suburban sea of red tile roofs and manicured backyards planted with lemon and orange trees , past platforms packed with schoolgirls in turquoise tunics and schoolboys in maroon blazers . Aboard are 144 passengers , the train 's capacity . They are young backpackers headed west , retired couples on an endless vacation , students , and an assortment of tourists . <P> For 65 hours the Indian-Pacific rushes over a kaleidoscope of landscape . From the steep Blue Mountains of the Great Dividing Range it speeds toward the stark-naked Nullarbor Plain . It flashes by farms with earth so red that the livestock watering holes seem to be filled with blood . It races past nickel , lead and gold mines , flocks of fleecy merinos , smelters , slag heaps , ports and forests . It passes signs exhorting WELFARE NOT WARFARE and OUR HOSPITAL NEEDS YOUR HELP : PLEASE GET SICK . A big painted rock aimed at shooing away pilots seeking to land says PISS OFF . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking station , used for guiding American astronauts , glow in the night . To the east , the moonlit rails turn molten in the Popsicle-or-ange sunrise . This is the time of day a kangaroo likes to lick the dew off the steel track . Or when a yellow-eyed dingo , Australia 's coyote , will stand its ground and stare sourly at the train while a spindly-legged emu , the local version of an ostrich , will try to outrun the 3,300-h.p. diesel express . <P> Now the diesel engines pull <P> Like a mighty station bull . <P> - Anonymous ballad <P> By morning the train is in Menindee , where paddle-wheelers used to p ! y the caf-au-lait-colored Darling River . From Menindee , a water pipe runs beside the track for 75 miles to the parched mining city of Broken Hill . A man must live in Broken Hill for eight years just to qualify for work in the lead , zinc and silver mines of this hard , uncompromising , union-ruled town .
