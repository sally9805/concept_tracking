Not one of the twelve teams of the gestating World Football League has even a preseason roster yet . No one knows when or if the newest experiment in pro sport expansion will seriously challenge the National Football League for fans . But there is one thing the W.F.L. owners do not lack : money with which to bargain for talent . Last week , before N.F.L. owners could unholster their pens , the W.F.L. 's Southern California franchise signed three top college stars . The upstart league has also drafted 69 other college players , though how many of them will actually sign contracts is still uncertain . <P> The three who agreed to go with the new enterprise : U.S.C. Offensive Tackle Booker Brown and U.C.L.A. Running Backs James McAlister and Kermit Johnson .

He announced a television contract to broadcast one game a week starting in July . He also disclosed innovations designed to lure fans with peppier play : an optional two-point conversion , a fifth period to settle ties , kickoffs from the 30-yard line . But the crucial question for now is the identity of the players . <P> " The war is on , " chortled Attorney Bob Woolf , who makes his living negotiating athletes ' contracts . Woolf predicts a 100% increase in players ' salaries in the next year . After a second college draft , the next step will be an attempt to hire veteran N.F.L. players . A likely target is Joe Namath , who nine years ago gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning down the N.F.L. and signing with the New York Jets .
