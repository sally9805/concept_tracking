txt Letters Letters Law of averages Mark J. Green 's article ( " The high cost of lawyers , " Aug. 10 ) is another of a seemingly endless series of articles which unjustly criticize the legal profession and perform a public disservice as well . Those of us who are dedicated to our profession are sick and tired of being criticized and abused by the courts , by the press and , most distressing of all , by our own colleagues . Perhaps this is the time and opportunity to set the record straight . The " average " attorney is hard-working and is dedicated to his family , profession and community . He is respected in his community and devotes many of his working and free hours towards its betterment . His profession is called upon . and is expected , to contribute not only financially but witL skill and expertise in charitable and service organizations and in local governmental functions . How often have my " average " colleagues wished that they were paid for everything they did as professionals ? The number of hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensated , or not even compensated at all , is staggering ! How often have unpaid services resulted in the avoidance of litigation , the restoration of marital tranquillity and other similar beneficial services ? Every profession requires self-analysis and improvement , but to continually single out the legal profession for criticism and condemnation i4 totally unjust and uncalled for . ABRAHAM L. BANNER Poughkeepsie , N.Y . Waiting at the bar Having just graduated from Fordham Law School , I can not help but reflect upon Mark Green 's reference to the 1973 Harris Poll , which indicated that only 18 per cent of the public had confidence in law f:rms . If we are to accept Ramsey Clark 's observat:on that 90 per cent of all lawyers represent 10 per cent of the people , perhaps the time is ripe for the bar associations to swell the ranks of the 18 per cent with the " unrepresented 90 per cent " by permitting the use of advertising to the extent necessary to inform this 90 per cent group of the legal services available from other than those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petrocelli . With such an untapped source of clientele available , combined with the possibility of utilizing prepaid group legal insurance to pay for such legal services , perhaps the present glut of lawyers in the market can be absorbed : and I and my fellow graduates reed not fear following in the footsteps of the engineers and teachers who preceded us . ROBERT ALAN SAASTO Brooklyn , N. Y. Retainers and retainees Mark Green pointed out that " 25-year-olds fresh out of law school are now starting at $18,000 to $20,000 in major cities . . . . " The firms which pay those salaries believe they are getting fair value because those young lawyers take enormous pride in their work  --  and accuracy is a by-product of that pride . Unhappily , that kind of accuracy is a quality found wanting in Mr. Green 's article . This is particularly regrettable when the facts are readily available . Mr. Green did not take the trouble to inquire . Specifically , Mr. Green writes : " Mrs. Onassis apparently spared no expense in retaining New York City 's Paul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and privacy-invader Ron Galella . She won , but her late husband , Ari , refused to pay the $400,000 bill . ( The law firm sued , and settled for $225,000 . ) " Virtually every allegation in these three short sentences is wrong : ( 1 ) Paul , Weiss was retained by Mr. Onassis . ( 2 ) Paul , Weiss was not retained to sue Galella . Galella sued Mrs. Onassis , claiming damages of $1.5-million for a spurious false arrest . Paul , Weiss was retained to defend that suit . The claim against Galella for harassment was asserted as a counterclaim in his suit . ( 3 ) ft is true that Mrs. Onassis was victorious , but it is not true that there was a $400,000 bill . ( 4 ) When the firm 's bill to Mr. Onassis went unpaid . Paul , Weiss sued . The complaint sought to recover from him the reasonable value of our services as determined by the court . It specified no Letters amount . Since Mr. Onassis was a nonresident , Paul , Weiss was permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might reasonably be expected to be obtained on that basis . That attachment request was in the amount of $400,000. ( 5 ) Within 24 hours of the institution of suit , Mr. Onassis called at our office , found we were in substantial agreement respecting the amount of our bill , and made prompt payment . There was no bill for $400,000 , and there was no settlement for $225,000 . MARTIN LONDON Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton &; Garrison New York City Claimant Mark Green states that Mrs. Onassis sued me . This is not true . I was the plaintiff and Mrs. Jacqueline Onassis et al . was the defendant . RON GALELLA Yonkers , N. Y. Mark Green replies : For those who wonder why people make fun of punctilious lawyers , consider Martin London 's huffy letter . He carves out a single incident from the article , attempts to carve it up  --  and cuts himself n the process . Huff : supposedly Mr. Onassis retained the law firm . Given his relationship to one acqueline Onassis , however , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid the bill because , said Ari , " I had nothing to do with the damned thing . " Huff : supposedly there was no $400.000 bill . Yet Mr. London acknowledges that his firm attached $400,000 of Onassis property in anticipation of a reasonable judgment ; are we to assume that this is a mere coincidence ? Huff : Galella sued Mrs. Onassis rather than the reverse . Which is formalistically true , but actually irrelevant . As any awyer can tell you , a counterclaim must be an indepenlent cause of action which could sustain a law suit ; thus . he difference between suing and counterclaiming is that the former litigant won the race to the courthouse . ( Simi ? arly , Mr. Galella 's indignation on this point  --  especially given that his claim was thrown out and Mrs. Onassis 's upheld ? seems misplaced . ) Huff : " The facts are readily available . " This is a surprising assertion . For when The New York Times asked Mr. London about the amounts involved in the settlement of his law firm 's law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a comment . Legal " loss leaders " Mark Green correctly quotes me as saying that the legal fees customarily charged in probate are way out of line in relation to the time spent by the lawyer . On the other hand , the fees usually charged for preparing wills are very low in relation to the time a lawyer necessarily must devote to this task . A lawyer ca n't hope to make a living drafting $50 to $100 wills . So why this seeming generos-ity ? It 's really very . simple . Wills are " loss leaders " for the lucrative probate which follows the client 's death . The lawyer who drafts a will anticipates that he will be called upon to probate that will and handle the estate settlement . Here the customary percentage-based fees usually run into the thousands of dollars . Many older lawyers look forward to finishing out the last years of their practice in the relative comfort and affluence of probating wills and settling estates . With two or three wills " maturing " each year , it works pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's paying the premiums . It 's time we got away from this unjust system of overcompensating lawyers for probate work , of the courts rubber-stamping ( or not even being aware of ) exorbitant fees which have absolutely no relationship to the time or effort expended by . or the competency of , the lawyer . Probate judges should see to it that only reasonable legal fees are charged . And what can he more reasonable than a fee based upon the dual considerations of the amount of time spent by the lawyer and the appropriateness , under the circumstances . of his hourly time charge ? But the public will aLso have to play its part , by not balking when a lawyer asks to to paid for his time when he prepares the will . There should be no more bargainbasement $50 wills , no more expecting the lawyer to work for little now in the hope of reaping a bonanza later . After all , it 's a two-way street !
