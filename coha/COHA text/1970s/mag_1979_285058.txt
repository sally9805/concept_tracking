Talking about where he has been in the past two frantic years , Alex Haley sounds like a gazetteer . Osaka , Paris , Tehran , Tel Aviv . They seem as familiar to him as stations on a commuter run in Connecticut . Then , listening to him self , he stops and smiles apologetically . " And to think that when I was growing up in Henning , Tennessee , it used to be a big deal to get a lift on a feed truck to Memphis ! " The phenomenal success of Roots has not so much changed Haley 's life as it has obliterated it , giving him a new and often uncomfortable persona as if he were seeing himself in a strange , distorting mirror . " It 's like a kaleidoscope , a whirlpool into which I 've fallen , " he says . " My feet are suspended above ground and I ca n't get a perch . <P> <P> For months at a time I average only four hours of sleep a night . " <P> Haley can even pinpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 , 1977 , the morning after the last episode of Roots was aired . Many writ ers find their lives altered by a bestselling book , but perhaps no other writer in history , from Homer to Norman Mailer , has been hit so hard so suddenly with so great a success . Roots as a book was already a bestseller ; then came the TV triumph , which sent hundreds of thousands of additional read ers out to look for the book , making it the No. 1 nonfiction bestseller in 1977 . <P> After watching the final segment of the television version in New York , Haley went out to the airport to fly to Los Angeles .

He started writing to relieve the bore dom of life aboard ship , and when he left the service in 1959 he decided on even more hazardous duty , the life of the freelance journalist . <P> It was in London , on a writing assignment in 1964 , that he conceived the idea of Roots . Looking at the British Museum 's Rosetta Stone , which is the key to an understanding of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs , he wondered if the strange African sounds his grandmother had passed on to him could somehow be the key to his own background . He discovered that they could , and he spent the next twelve years doing research and writing , eventually tracing his own origins back seven generations to a young African by the name of Kunta Kinte.
