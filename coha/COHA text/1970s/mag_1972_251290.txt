There were 350 people in the Atrium of Washington 's John F. Kennedy Center for the fourth annual Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards lunch - and the Kennedys dominated them all . Teddy , with his sisters Eunice Shriver and Jean Smith , were magnets to the old Kennedy hands , and Ethel , who had broken her leg while skiing , joked in a wheelchair . Kathleen ( R.F.K. 's eldest ) was the quintessential Radcliffe girl in granny glasses and flowing hair . Eldest son Joe-being nudged more and more into the family spotlight-gracefully presented bronze busts of his father to the winners . But it was the indomitable 81-year-old Rose who out-Kennedyed them all . After catnapping ever so lightly through some of the preliminaries , she rose to speak for the family . " I feel a little like old wine , " she mused in that throaty voice . " My family keeps me stored away until there 's a special occasion ! " <P> - <P> Russian Poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko was impressed by the Apollo 16 launch , but what really grabbed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accompanied by Apollo 15 Astronaut David Scott and a bottle of champagne . He forgot to open the bottle , so moved was he by " the white , tender body of the rocket , supported by the clumsy , tender hands of its red tower . It was like big brother embracing his sister before going a long way . It was a great impression . " And that was not all . The tower was also " a sea crab that accidentally found on the bottom of the sea a rare and unusual white pearl it was holding in its clumsy claw . " According to Yevtushenko , Astronaut Scott exclaimed : " It 's absolutely what I feel , but I did n't express it . " - <P> He is Prudent who is Patient is the motto of the British House of Leicester . So patient was the second Earl of Leicester that he spent all of his 67 years in the House of Lords waiting for something to say . His son , the third Earl was equally silent for 32 years . The fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leicester patience has at last run out . The present Earl , 63-year-old Thomas William Edward Coke has risen after only 22 years of silence to make his maiden speech . His subject : pollution . " I hope we shall use safer chemicals in place of those which have devastated the countryside , " he said . - <P> " As a foster child of ten , I dreamed that someday I would be the guest of honor at just such an affair , talking about the struggles of my childhood and how I overcame them . I particularly liked the part in my dreams when I gave myself a standing ovation . " Humorist Art Buchwald , 46 , was telling it like it had been to the sesquicentennial brunch of New York 's Jewish Child Care Association . His fantasy that he was really a Rothschild who had been kidnaped by gypsies did n't quite come true , but as a columnist for the Paris Herald Tribune , " I lived it up with the international set , sailed on Onassis ' yacht , played roulette with King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And at the end of his speech , he did get that standing ovation. -
