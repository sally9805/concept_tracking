Mass strikes , demonstrations and riots exploded throughout Poland last summer , paralyzing the nation and provoking panic in Warsaw , dismay in Moscow . The immediate cause of the uprising was a dramatic increase in food prices , but the roots of the rebellion lay deep in the dissatisfaction of the fiercely independent Polish people with Soviet-imposed Communist rule . <P> The summer protests marked the third time in two decades that insurgent workers had illegally struck against unpopular government measures and won their case . Workers ' demonstrations in 1956 and 1970 had even brought down the reigning party chiefs in Warsaw . This time , the present Polish party boss , Edward Gierek , survived the riots by immediately rolling back prices . Still , lingering discontent in Poland , tied to a worsening economic crisis , has produced the classic formula for rebellion . TIME Correspondent Henry Muller recently visited Poland to gauge the public mood as the nation entered what threatens to be a long turbulent winter . His report : <P> As the cold autumn days grow shorter , Eastern Europe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its most difficult year since 1970 . In the late afternoon , outside one of the new Western-style supermarkets in Warsaw , a line of people 20 yds. long extends out the door and into the chilly darkness . It is mostly women , bundled in heavy coats and woolen scarves , their cheeks turned crimson by the subfreezing temperature . It is the ubiquitous meat queue , the most common symbol of Poland 's political and economic malaise . <P> Good meat is virtually unavailable . Sugar has been rationed . Street lights in certain areas are no longer turned on . Although many Poles have money in the bank , there is little to spend it on . The waiting time for a new Polish-built Fiat is from three to five years , and gasoline has risen 70% , to $2.07 per gal. , since 1973 . About 1.5 million people must share their dwellings with other families ; the waiting period for an apartment is often as long as ten years . Sixty miles south of Warsaw , in the town of Radom , where last summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Catholic priest observed , " The mood is bad . People complain , they curse , they show little interest in doing their jobs properly . " <P> The shortage of food and consumer goods is only one reason for the prevailing grimness . More important , perhaps , is that the people feel betrayed by the government . Says Stefan Kisielewski , a former member of Parliament : " The problem is not just meat . It is a lack of confidence in our leaders . " There is a widespread feeling that the Gierek government played a dirty trick on the people when last June it announced price hikes ranging from 30% on poultry to 69% on meat . Although many Poles concede that increases were necessary and long overdue , they expected them to be gradually imposed . Real wages had risen 7.1% annually since 1971 , while prices of basic foodstuffs remained frozen , causing scarcities and a totally artificial price structure . But the brutal suddenness of the price hikes brought the workers into the streets once more . " It was as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of December , " observed a Western diplomat .
