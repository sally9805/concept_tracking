THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment tAST month , a study for the American Association for the- Advance- I ment of Science revealed that at least a fifth of the one million two hundred thousand acres of mangrove forest in South Vietnam had been " utterly destroyed " by United States defoliation , and no vegetation had taken its place . Early this month , Jerry W. Friedbeim , a Defense Department spokesman , attacked the study , saving , according to the Times , that there was no certainty that the forest would not conic hack , and , anyway , " some parts 14 South Vietnam 's economy , notably the forest industry and small farmrs , might have benefited from defoliation . " Friedheim was quoted as saying , " Parts of the hardwood forest have been destroyed and can now he lumbered . Defoliation permits easier access , so crews can go in and bring out the wood .

What about the increased play area for children , without hazardous trees to fall out of , and damp , unpleasant shade ? What about the- enlarged vistas  --  the broad open spaces  --  for scenery lovers ? What about the enlarged opportunities for construction  --  shopping centers , housing developments without costly land Ilea rim g ? THE other day , we received a letter that began , " Where but in New York would citizens he buying lizards for protection ? " Without reading further , we knew we had heard once again from our angry friend who writes occasionally on the off chance that we have forgotten just how exasperating he finds life in the city . " A few days ago , I dropped in to see some friends of mine . whom I 'll call Ralph and Myrna Cole , and discovered they had bought a type of lizard called a gecko , " lie continued . " When I asked what bad driven them to lizardry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York bus drivers arc to passengers natural enemies . Once the Coles discovered this characteristic of the gecko ( I should probably say of the family Gekkonidae ; however many cockroaches there are , this town is always crawling with pedants ) , they-rushed right out and bought one , for three dollars and eighteen cents , the wretched city sales tax ( which I have always considered the equivalent of charging admission to a dungeon ) included . They have now had their gecko for about a month . At least , they think they have had it ; geckos are extremely shy  --  the ( ) nit creature in the metropolitan area suffering from that affliction , to judge from the number of people who push ahead of Inc in line every day  --  and the Coles have n't seen theirs since they brought it borne and uncaged it in their apartment with instructions to gobble up every cockroach in sight . According to the Coles , the kind of gecko they have , which is Brook 's gecko ( Hemidactylus brooki ) , I  --  nl- two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or a night , really , since geckos tend to be nocturnal . The Coles , in other words , bought this lizard to act as a kind of mini-predator . " ' It 's nice to go to bed at night knowing that the little fellow is going to down three of them before we get up in the morning , ' Ralph told me . ' If he 's still here , that is . ' " ' What makes you think he 's still here ? ' I asked , sneaking a glance under the couch . " ' We may have three fewer cockroaches than usual , ' Ralph said . ' Cockroaches multiply very fast , though , and the cockroaches in our apartment were uncountable to begin with , so it 's hard to tell . ' " ' We do n't have to feed him , of course , because he lives on cockroaches , ' Myrna said . ' At least , if he 's still here , he does . ' " ' Does n't it bother you any to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " ' Well , at first I was worried about waking up one morning and finding the gecko on my pillow , ' Myrna said . ' But the pet-shop man told me that I 'd he able to tell if a gecko was nearby  --  it makes a soft noise that sounds like gec.ko . " " Ralph then gave his gecko itnitation ? geck-o , gcck-o , Beck-o ' ? and I began to worry about the Coles . Frank-h , Ralph has n't been the same since a news dealer called him a Fascist for asking for change for a quarter . Myrna has been acting a hit odd since she hoarded a downtown East Side I.R.T. subway and was taken to Philadelphia . Just on a hunch , I called on one of the chief reptile suppliers in the city  --  a place on Bleecker Street called Exotic Aquatics , which happens to be right across the street from a place called Mystical Kennels . ( In a civilized city , of course , merchants would be fined for displaying cutesy store names in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diminutive of and ' ? Knickknacks ' n ' Such or Strings ' n ' Things  --  would be put in the stocks . ) " Despite its name , Exotic Aquatics seemed to be run by a sensible tradesman . He was sensible enough , in fact , to inform me that any lizard will indiscriminately . cat just about anything it runs across that seems small enough to eat  --  cockroach , cricket , or Landon button . " ' Do you mean the gecko does n't have a special cockroach-eating capacity ? ' I asked . " ' Well , I suppose it has been known to eat cockroaches , ' he said . ' And some people have always said that geckos are good for cockroach control . But we do n't push it . Most of the geckos we sell are for tanks .

" The License Plates of Burning Tree WE have a friend in Washington who knows the city from the inside in . H. M. Remeor is not his name , but it will do . He is of the category of men who have put in time feeding pens to Presidents and have long since melded into the panelling of D.C. law firms , where , although they have no specific connection with the government , they operate within a distinct aurora of clout . Remeor 's Washington is not the Washington of Capitol City Tours . For example , he once showed us through the endangered-species bins in the Department of the Interior , and on another occasion he took us to the cassette li brary in the Washington telephone exchange . He lives in the hills of suburban Maryland . In that general area , one day not long ago , we were riding with him in his car when he turned into what appeared to be someone 's long driveway . Wide lawns reached away from the drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a large stone house . The day was cold but sunlit , and windy . Behind the house were a couple of dozen cars , parked in an ovate ring . Mr. Remeor drove into the middle of this circle , stopped , and said , " This is the parking lot at Burning Tree . That is the clubhouse The golf course is over there . The course is hardly noticeable unless you get right on it . This place is so anonymous you 'd never know it was here , but it precedes the Pentagon on Brezhnev 's list of pinpoint targets in the Washington area . There are big men here , with big handicaps . More power goes off the tees of Burning Tree  --  for less distance  --  than at any other golf club on earth . Look who 's here even on a day as cold as this . " We looked around and saw no one . Mr. Remeor said , " Take a good look at the cars . " Directly in front of us was a Mercedes-Benz with an Arkansas license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two , " explained Mr. Remeor . " James William Fulbright , the junior senator from Arkansas . Naturally , he has a foreign car . He 's the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee . " Our eyes began to move from autoJANUARY 30 , 1 9 7 1 mobile to automobile , plate to plate : Thunderbird . " Now , who do you suppose that is ? " Mr. Remeor said . " Nino would you say is the eighth-most-important man in Missouri ? " We counted down our own list  --  the chairman of the board of Ralston Purina , Harry Truman , Governor Hearne.s , Warren Bradley , Anheuser , Busch , ... " Symington , " we said , finally . " Stuart Symington . Missouri 8 . " " You 've got it , " said Remeor . " Now have a look at that one . " He nodded toward a big Chrysler with a Maine license plate that had no numerals at all  --  just the word " SENATE , " in large block letters . " Muskie , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Remeor . " One thing for dead certain is that Margaret Chase Smith is not out here on this golf course today . Women are forbidden at Burning Tree . No woman ever sets font in that clubhouse . A long time ago , Joe Davies offered to build and pay for a swimming pool here , and the offer was indignantly refused , on the ground that a pool would increase pressure from women and children . The members take considerable pride in the fact that they can walk around nude in any part of the building . " We wondered how well everyone was doing on the golf course on such a cold afternoon , and back in our office , some days later , we would call up the cars ' owners to find out . Senator Symington , for example , said that the temperature had discouraged him , so he had just hit some balls from the practice tee . Senator Musleie 's office told us that Muskie had played and then had gone off to Moscow . " The Senator is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a member of his staff , who went on to say that three years ago , in Kennebunk , Muskie made a hole in one , and that he breaks ninety with about the same frequency . Senator Fulbright described his golf game to us in a general way , and there was something in his manner that might have suggested  --  had we been less familiar with the probity of the source  --  the crafted self-depreciation of an organized hustler . " My game is pretty poor , " he said . " I do n't play enough . I 'm getting old and decrepit . There 's nothing very exciting about my golf game or about the life I lead . As we get older , we get progressively duller and duller  --  you 'll find that out . I used to play more , but ever since I 've been the chairman of the committee I have n't been in the seventies . My golf is very poor . I played lacrosse at Oxford in 1926 , and , before that , football at Arkansas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is out . That hampers my golf . I did n't have a scheduled match . I just went out that afternoon and picked up a game . " The game he picked up was J. Lawn Thompson , M.D. ( D.C. Thunderbird- ? 701 ) , physician to Cabinets and Congresses , and former curator of Lyndon B. Johnson . " Hello , Dr. Thompson . How did you fare on the golf course with Senator Fulbright the other day ? " " As usual , I was talked out of everything . Senator Fulbright is a very persuasive man , not only in national politics but on the first tee . He has a way of creating unjustified sympathy for himself . He tells you how hard he 's been working , you know , and how tired he is , and that he has n't played golf very much , and the next thing you know you 're giving him strokes when he should be giving you strokes . So that 's how I fared . I reached in my pocket and paid him all of my Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your score , Dr. Thompson ? " " Eighty-four . " " What was the Senator 's score ? " " Three shots less  --  just enough , you know , to hang me up on the wall . " We would also try a call to the office of Senator Smith , for it nagged us that Muskie 's license plate mere-1 ) said " SENATE . " What , then , could hers possibly say ? " It says " her administrath-e assistant told us . Moving slowly through the parking lot , Mr. Remeor next pointed out a Florida Lincoln Continental  --  MC 9 . " Member of Con-gress , Ninth District , " we said . " You 're ready , " he said . " Paul Rogers , of West Palm Beach , is the congressman from the Ninth District of Florida . " Ohio , Continental  --  FMF . " That 's a tough one , " Remeor said . " Unless you happen to know that Congressman Michael A. Feighan , of Ohio , once married a girl named Florence Mathews . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District , " Mr. Remeor said . Representative Davis later told us that he had had to fight to stay under a hundred that day , and had lost at golf , but had then gone inside and won back his money in a gin-rummy game . District of Columbia , Mercury-341 . " That 's Doug Mode , " Mr. Remeor said . " He 's a lawyer . Does the same sort of thing I do . Doug was a pallbearer at Walter Hagen 's funeral , and he has a set of Hagen 's clubs , but he 's not much of a golfer . He plays golf in the fall , when there are no gnats . Today , he 'll he in there playing gin . He was the advance man for Dewey in the ' 44 campaign . He got his low license plate through Homer Ferguson . " We asked Mr. Remeor if he himself was a golfer . " Oh , Lord , no , " he said . " I ca n't stand the game . " Passing by Mercedes-Benz DPL 2079 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luis Machado . Note the diplomatic license . He was once the Cuban Ambassador to the United States . Before that , he was president of the Havana Country Club . " Cadillac , D.C.-144 . " You know Abe Fortas ' old law firm , Arnold , Fortas &; Porter ? " Mr. Remeor said . " Well , that 's Porter . Porter has a chauffeur named Henry Ford . " Pontiac , D.C. ? WHL 1 . " That must belong to Bill Lawrence , of A.B.C . " Lawrence later told us that he had been playing gin at that moment with W. P. Folger , Doug Mode , and John Charles Daly . " I play a lot of gin these days , " he said . " I do n't play golf unless it 's warm . They kid me at my office about spending a lot of time at Burning Tree , but I explain that it 's the center of power in Washington . No , there 's no WHL 2 . I just have the one car . The ' 1 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind giving that impression . " One automobile at Burning Tree- a Continental , Texas , BKZ 922 ? attracted us not because of its code number but because of its size . There was something magnified about it . It seemed too big for a continent , let alone a Continental . Each of its fenders appeared to be large enough to garage a Volkswagen . Surely all this automobile could not he the carapace of a mere senator . Mr. Remeor had no idea whose it was , so we later called a policeman friend of ours , and he radioed somewhere , and word came quickly hack that Texas BKZ 922 was the automobile of Lieutenant General John C. Meyer , Director of Operations , United States Air Force , two hundred combat missions over Europe , one of the top air aces of all time , Croix de Guerre from France end Belgium , Air Medal , Silver Star , D.F.C. , and D.S.C. , with thirteen ( Did you say thirteen ? Roger . Repeat , thirteen ) oak-leaf clusters . We put in a call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general General Meyer is , for in order to propose a talk with him we had to spend fifteen minutes talking with another general  --  Brigadier General H. L. Hogan III ( five oak-leaf clusters ) ? who politely told us that he would sec what he could do and would call us back . A day or so later , he called to say that he was still having difficulty getting through to General Meyer on the matter of the golf game but that he . would continue the effort and call us again . " I just did n't want you to think we were n't working on the problem , " said generous General Hogan . " Let 's see what we can whomp up . " Two days later , the Pentagon called again . " This is General Hogan , " said General Hogan . " Stand by for General Meyer ! " " This is General Meyer speaking . My game is generally pretty had . I must have played a lousy game that afternoon , because if it was good I would remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't find the weather particularly cold .. I would guess I was somewhere around my usual game , which is like ninety-two or three or four . If I was worse than a hundred , I would remember that , too . If I 'd played a good game , I could tell you every stroke . " At Burning Tree , as we retreated down the long driveway , Mr. Remeor said , " You may recall that Burning Tree is where the Martian landed on the eighth green and went up to President Eisenhower and said , ' Take me to your leader . ' This place has a rich history . The policy of the club has always been that it wants no publicity whatsoever , but sometimes it ca n't help getting it . According to another story that went around , Ike was playing here one day and Secret Service men came running out of the woods and conferred with him , and then they rushed up the fairway to the next foursome and said , ' Excuse us , gentlemen , but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just received word that New York has been bombed . ' ... Yes , yes , Nixon is a member here . The President and the Vice-President Nixon and Agnew . They 've even got the president of the P.G.A . in there , as their pro . Of all the American Presidents who have ever played the game , John Kennedy was by a country mile the best golfer . His back bothered him , and he played for only a short period each time he came out here . He would just show up , shoot a few pars , and leave . Think of this : Nixon sponsored John Kennedy for membership here . The club has a collection of drivers that have been used by Presidents . By and large , the members are an informal and unstuffy bunch of men . In the siimmertime , they play in short pants and wear no shirts . Some of them play in their undershorts . They put on long drawers and play all through the winter . I 've been in clubs all over the world that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least pretentious , the most homey , the most humble . There is nothing burning here . Centuries ago , there was a tree here that glowed in the night , probably from phosphorus , so the Indians called this region Potomac , the Place of the Burning Tree , " Three Gatherings IN the elaborate offices of Otto Prem- I Inger , film producer , Mr. Preminger ( seated behind a marble desk , wearing a purple tie ) and Mr. Eliot Fremont-Smith , editor-in-chief of Little , Brown ( seated at one end of the marble desk , wearing a tie of no color whatever ) , were making a Joint Announcement of Major Interest . On the top of Mr. Preminger 's desk were scattered papers , pictures , and a desk sculpture , and around it were scattered a number of reporters from movie and publishing trade publications who had been summoned by telegram for Mr. Preminger 's announcement . The reporters appeared to be slightly more interested in the movie " Love Story " than in the anmiuncernent , and talked among themselves and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is a picture about two most idea people , " said Mr. Preminger . " Thee make love only with hooks in their hands . ' Mr. Preminger , who has a manner of considerable , but pleasant , authority , began to make his announcement , ( It was a joint announcement in that Mr. Fremont-Smith listened knowingly . ) " I have just acquired the motion-picture rights to a novel by Richard Jessup , " he said . " The title of the hook is Toxway . ' It is what we usually call a human-interest story . Last Wednesday , appeared a manuscript very badly Xeroxed . I could n't put it down . " Mr. Preminger discussed his reactions to the book , his feelings as he read it Mr. Fremont-Smith put the hook in its proper context ( " A telling , moving , upsetting portrait of an American way of life today " ) . The reporters asked no-nonsense questions ( " Anybody in mind for the lead ? " I. Mr. Preminger responded only vaguely to the no-nonsense questions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I never discuss what things cost . I do n't ask what you paid for that lovely shirt you arc wearing . I can say that probably when the picture is released we will charge three dollars a seat . " The discussion turned to " Love Story " once again . Everyone agreed that the fact that the book was a bestseller had helped the picture . " There are two advertising media , " Mr. Preminger said . " One is the bestseller . The other is TV . I know , because from time to time I go on these talk shows . Whenever I go , everyone has seen it , everyone recognizes me . In this cold weather , a car pulled up and a little girl  --  not such a little girl ; thirty-five or so gotout and said she had seen me on a talk program . And it was so cold to get out of the car . Stupid , in my opinion . And where was she from Hartford , Connecticut . " MHAT evening , people from the I art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. and Mrs. Gardner Cowles . Mr. and Mrs. Cowles have had a large , conventional East Side apartment reduced to rubble and a. new one ' built . Paul Rudolph , who did the rebuilding , used curved lacquered walls , Mylar walls , and many , many mirrors , and the guests of Mr. and Mrs. Cowles admired all these things . People wandered admiringly through the living room , where there was an enormous painting by Frank Stella on a curved brown-lacquered wall , and through the library , the floor of which was carpeted in goatskin , and many congregated in Mrs. Cowles ' bathroom , which was a tunnel vaulted in silver War and studded with hundreds ( perhaps thousands ) of tiny mirrors . There was a painting by Magritte on a wall near " Madam , please ! Tri : hat I distinctly said was that I rould lick any Mall in the house . " the bathroom . " Did you see the dear little Magritte ?

" There was something I wanted to talk to you about , but I forget what it was , " she said . " We 're going to London to see the Stones . Everything 's the Stones . I 'm to sick of it . " We asked Mr. Warhol if he was impressed by the apartment . " Oh , yeah , " he said . " I 've been here before .

" Separate checks , separate tables . " We made our way through to the back of the room , where Ruby Keeler was sitting with Busby Berkeley . On the way , we passed an intense young lady wearing a lot of simple silver jewelry . " Actually , there 's very little protocol at the top , " she was saying to her companion .
