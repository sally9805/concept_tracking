txt Governor Rockefeller , responding with scorn and sarcasm to Mayor Lindsay 's criticisms of him and of the recent session of the State Legislature , said yesterday of the Mayor : " He 's not responsible for what he 's saying . He 's emotionally upset . The poor man has been under a lot of pressure . " The Governor 's remarks came in a brief news conference before a luncheon of the New York Republican State Committee at the New York Hilton . At a luncheon , attended by Senate Majority Leader Earl W. Brydges and Assembly Speaker Perry B , Duryea , Mr. Rockefeller defended the record of the Republican-controlled Legislature as " objective , careful , positive , constructive , ' but not " vindictive " as some city officials have charged . The Governor , saying he " sympathized " with the Mayor , contended that Mr. Lindsay had been " under a lot of pressure " because ? " the strike actions were emotional things . " The Governor 's thrusts were in response to two remarks made by Mayor Lindsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Conference of Mayors . In a wry , joking manner at the banquet , Mr. Lindsay continued his recent attack on the Legislature , saying , according to a spokesman , that the city " had been raped , but we 're being charged with prostitution " and that " we 've been thrown into the water and we 're accused of drowning . " The bitterness inherent in the recent exchange of comments between the state 's two most prestigious Republicans underscores a long-time , deep-seated mutual hostility . Their political feud ? often open , always smoldering  --  dates back six years , since July , 1965 , when it was rumored that the then Representative John V. Lindsay had joined a movement led by Senator Jacob K. Javits to force Mr. Rockefeller out of the running for the governorship in 1966 . Mr. Lindsay denied the rumor at the time , but Mr. Rockefeller , was nevertheless reported to have been angry and resentful , although he contributed an estimated total of $500,000 to Mr. Lindsay 's successful mayoral campaign in 1965 . The continuing feud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican legislative leaders that Mr. Lindsay was responsible for " declining city services due to inept and extravagant administration of the city government . " Mr. Rockefeller and the legislative leaders also charged that efforts to resolve the city 's fiscal problems had been " hindered by a growing loss of confidence in the Mayor 's administration of the city . " The Mayor , at the time , replied only that he had been saddened that the Governor and the legislative leaders " would reduce themselves to this level of attack . " Yesterday , the Mayor declined to comment directly on the Governor 's latest observations . But Mr. Lindsay 's assistant press secretary , Robert Laird , who said he was speaking for the Mayor , said : " Poor we are . Pressured we are . But we know when we 've been screwed . " Later , Mr. Laird said that the Mayor 's press secretary , Tom Morgan , wanted to have the response attributed to him . The Governor , in his meeting with newsmen yesterday , was asked what his intention was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a move that came a few hours before the Legislature adjourned . The commission , which is to have subpoena power , will consist of three Rockefeller appointees and one each by Senator Brydges and Speaker Duryea . With a half-smile , Governor Rockefeller replied that there were no political implications intended and that " we simply want to look at the city 's management . " Statehood Discussed The Governor also was asked to comment on the Mayor 's response to the commission . That response was to set up a city commission to examine the state 's management of city affairs and the possibility of reorganizing the city as the 51st state . " Nothing wrong with that , the Governor said . He also was asked if he did not possess the power to remove Mayor Lindsay front office . " Yes , " he said with a smile . " I have that power . " Did he intend to exercise it ? " I 'm not considering such a move , " he said . The Governor repeated that he was " trying to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " childish . " In his post-luncheon address , the Governor continued his wry comments . He said it was wrong of Mayor Lindsay to call the legislative tax authorizations a " tax package . " " We call it a fiscal package , " he said . After calling the recent legislative session " the most difficult in the state , " Mr. Rockefeller said he wanted to tell the diners that Senator Brydges had acted " in a warm , human way " to the " tragic job actions " in the city by " recommitting all the bills on pensions . " His audience laughed . Last night at the Republican State Committee 's 23d annual dinner , the themes of the day were repeated . Senator Brydges and Governor Rockefeller defended the performance of the state legislators ; and there were more caustic comments about Mayor Lindsay , this time from Senator Brydges , Mr. Brydges read with obvious enjoyment a letter sent to the committee on April 5 by the Mayor 's appointment secretary , which said that the Mayor , " due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . The reading was greeted by laughter by many of the 3,000 people who paid $150 each to be in the Hilton 's Grand Ballroom , Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz , Senator James L. Buckley and Senator Jacob Javits addressed the guests briefly , and the entire dais of invited guests went in a caravan of taxis and limousines six blocks to the Waldorf-Astoria , where the greetings and speeches were repeated for 2,500 other guests at a similar dinner . Charles Lanigan , state chairman , said the two dinners were expected to gross $1-million and to net the state Republican organization about $700,000.
