A Little Help for His Friends <P> For a politician as wealthy as Nelson Rockefeller , money can be a curse as well as a blessing . His millions have convinced some people that because he has everything , he is incorruptible ; but those same millions inevitably arouse suspicion among other people that he may be buying political support or unduly influencing public policy for his family 's benefit . There is no evidence that the vast Rockefeller family fortune has been so used ; nor is Rocky 's confirmation as Vice President yet in serious trouble . Nevertheless , the normally chipper and confident Rockefeller was embarrassed and distressed when news of his lavish gifts to a variety of people leaked out last week . <P> Several gifts seemed wholly innocent acts of compassion , such as covering medical expenses or easing the financial problems of retiring aides . At least one gift came perilously close to violating New York State 's conflict-of-interest laws , however , and others raised questions of propriety . Hugh Morrow , Rockefeller 's chief press spokesman for 15 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Many of these friends have been in public service where the pay is not always commensurate with what these people could earn elsewhere , " said Morrow . A Senate aide described the practice more picturesquely : " It 's like the old lords of the manor giving Christmas purses to the retainers . " The circumstances surrounding Rocky 's gifts varied widely : <P> HENRY KISSINGER , $50,000 . While a member of the Harvard faculty , Kissinger worked for Rockefeller and advised him on world and national issues for 13 years . On Jan. 17,1969 , as Kissinger was about to become President Nixon 's top national security adviser , Rockefeller told him in a letter that he was arranging a $50,000 gift " as a token of my friendship and my appreciation for the work you have done in service to the people of this country . It comes from Happy and me , with our warmest best wishes . " Kissinger consulted White <P> House attorneys , who made no objection to his accepting the money , then put the funds into a trust account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the money ; - Kissinger paid a tax on the trust . Still , North Carolina 's Republican Senator Jesse Helms complained in the Senate : " Even if it is legal , there is a question of whether or not it is proper to induce a sense of substantial obligation in a man who is about to become a senior public official . " <P> WILLIAM J. RONAN , $625,000 . <P> While serving in high transportation posts during Rockefeller 's 14-year governorship , Ronan borrowed heavily from his boss . Neither Rockefeller nor Ronan would detail the purposes of the loans and gifts further than vaguely citing real estate purchases and financial responsibilities . Ronan in 1968 became the $75,000-a-year chairman of New York 's Metropolitan Transportation Authority , which owns and operates the New York City area public transit system . He quit last May when Rocky was no longer Governor . Apparently in the few days before Ronan was appointed by the Governors of New York and New Jersey as the unsalaried head of the Port Authority of those two states , Rockefeller canceled the Ronan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift tax of $331,000 on this debt cancellation .
