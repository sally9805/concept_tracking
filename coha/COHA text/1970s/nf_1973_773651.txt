txt // also to allow time for heat to be conducted to the lower levels of metal . Even so , welding is limited to a maximum depth of about 1 mm . A number of specialised applications have also been found in the medical field , for example , in the treatment for a detached retina . Finally , a warning must be given of the dangers of lasers . The primary danger is to the eyes as even very low-energy lasers can produce permanent damage to the retina . Care must therefore be taken to avoid any possibility of looking along the beam towards the laser . This may be done inadvertently during lining-up procedures or when there are any mirrors or reflecting metal surfaces in the path of the beam . There is also a danger with the high voltages involved with the high-frequency power supply . POLARISATION 3.6 Polarised Light Light is an electromagnetic radiation and as such is specifically a transverse wave . These waves arise from the vibrations of charged particles within the molecules that make up the light source , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of visible light . The light wave sent out by one molecule may be considered to be plane polarised , since vibrations occur in only one plane containing the direction of propagation . For a large number of molecules , each of the vibrations is normally in a random direction and , as the resulting beam of light is made up of vibrations in all directions perpendicular to its direction of propagation , so that there is no preponderance of vibrations in any particular transverse direction , the light is said to be unpolarised . If , however , there is any asymmetry , the beam is said to be polarised . Every electromagnetic wave has associated magnetic-field , electricfield , and electric-displacement vectors . The magnetic- and electricfield vectors and the direction of energy propagation , which in the case of light waves is the ray direction , are mutually perpendicular . In an isotropic material , such as unstrained glass , the electric-field and displacement vectors coincide . Thus light , being an electromagnetic // wave , has associated with it these three vectors of which the electricdisplacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important . Although two waves travelling along the same path but with their electric-vibration directions mutually perpendicular can not produce interference effects , they can however interact to produce a radiation with special properties . The equations of the two electric-displacement waves may be written as where x and y are the electric displacements in the xz- and yz-planes respectively at a time t= 0/w , where 0 is the phase and w is the angular frequency . Both waves are travelling in the z-direction with the same velocity and frequency but with a constant phase difference S and with different amplitudes , a and b , as in Figure 3. 7 . In the special case when = 0 so that the waves are in phase , the resultant vibration may be represented by a vector of maximum length ( a2 + b2 ) 1/2 and inclined at a constant angle tan-1 ( b/a ) with the x-axis , as in Figure 3.7 ( b ) . The length of the resultant vector varies with the phase 0 . Thus the two mutually plane-polarised waves have combined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference S is taken as it/2 , that is , the vibrations are in quadrature , equation 3.14 becomes By plotting the displacementsX and y at every instant as given by the phase 0 and combining these displacements vectorially , it is seen that the resultant varies in both magnitude and direction . Combining equations 3.13 and 3.15 , the resulting displacement is given by Equation 3.16 is the equation of an ellipse , implying that the end of the resultant vector moves along an elliptical path , as shown in Figure 3.7 ( c ) . The light wave resulting from the combination of two and mutually perpendicular plane-polarised waves in quadrature is thus described as elliptically polarised light . In the special case when the amplitudes of the combining waves are equal , that is , when a = b , equation 3.16 becomes the equation of a circle and the resultant light vibration is said to be circularly polarised . Increasing the phase difference S to 7r again produces plane-polarised light but now with an inclination tan-1 ( ? b/a ) to the x-axis . A further increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation 3.16 , that is , elliptically polarised light again , except that now the inclination to the x-axis is 0 ' where tan 0 ' = ? b tan 0 ( 3.18 ) a Thus , looking towards the source of light , the end of the rotating vector rotates in a clockwise direction with respect to the observer as the phase progresses with time . The elliptically ( or circularly ) polarised light is then termed positive or right handed , whereas the direction of rotation defined by equation 3.17 is said to be negative or left handed . For the more general case when the phase difference S is not an integral multiple of 7r/2 , the resultant vibration is still elliptically polarised but the major axes of the ellipse are no longer along the x- and y-axes . Circularly and plane-polarised light may thus be considered as special cases of elliptically polarised light . 3.7 Production of Plane-polarised Light Any device that produces polarised light is termed a polariser ; when this same device is used to detect polarised light it is then termed an analyser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , a glass plate . Unpolarised light incident upon a surface at an angle 0 to the normal may be imagined resolved into two equal components , one of which has its electric-vibration direction parallel to the plane of incidence , that is , the plane containing the incident ray and the normal to the surface , whilst the other has its vibration direction perpendicular to the plane of incidence . Part of each of these components will be refracted at the surface and part reflected . For the fraction of each of the incident components reflected , that is , the reflection coefficients , Fresnel has shown that where RP and RS are the reflection coefficients for the components with electric-vibration directions parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence respectively , and 0 and 0 ' are the angles of incidence and // refraction respectively . The angle of reflection is , of course , equal to the angle of incidence . These reflection coefficients are shown plotted in Figure 3.8 for various angles of incidence 8 for glass of refractive index 1.5 . The negative reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen from Figure 3.8 that the reflection coefficient Rp becomes zero for a particular value of the angle of incidence 0 . From equation 3.19 this will occur when 0 + 0 ' = 42 , that is , when the angle of incidence 0 = tan ' n where n , the refractive index , is equal to sin 0/ sin 0 ' . At this angle , termed the Brewster angle , only that component with vibrations perpendicular to the plane of incidence is reflected . Thus , at this angle , for an air/glass boundary , 100% of the incident light component with electric vibrations parallel to the plane of incidence is transmitted , whereas about 15% of the perpendicular vibration component is reflected and 85% transmitted . This 15% that is reflected is pure plane-polarised light but , since it must be remembered that it constitutes only n-% of the total incident light energy , a single surface can not be regarded as a very productive source of polarised light . However , by using a pile of glass plates inclined at the Brewster angle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sufficiently enhanced to provide a practical source . The transmitted // beam will become progressively purer plane polarised as more of the perpendicular component is removed and reflected . Since the Brewster angle is a function of the refractive index , which in turn is a function of the wavelength , the plane-polarised reflected light condition can only be satisfied for one angle at one wavelength . A polariser consisting of a pile of plates , therefore , should only be used with monochromatic light . Most methods of producing polarised light work on this same principle of producing unpolarised light , dividing it into two components having their electric vibrations at right angles , and then eliminating one of these components . Polarisation by dichroism involves this principle , by selectively absorbing one of the components . There are some naturally occurring crystals with this property , such as tourmaline and herapathite , but these tend to be small and not very good polarisers . E. H. Land utilised this principle of selective absorption when he invented Polaroid . This is manufactured by stretching a transparent sheet of plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long chain molecules parallel to the stretch direction . To prevent shrinkage the stretched sheet may be cemented to a rigid plastic sheet or , depending on the plastic used , it may be sufficient to allow it to cool after stretching . The stretched sheet is then dipped into iodine solution and iodine atoms diffuse into the plastic and arrange themselves along the long chains . After washing and drying , the sheet behaves as a polariser with the iodine chains acting as conducting wires ' . The light component with electric vibrations parallel to the iodine chains will // then induce an electric current in the conducting chains , which in turn produces heat . The energy of these vibrations will thus be absorbed . The other component , with electric vibrations perpendicular to the stretch direction , does not induce a current and so does not lose energy ; it is therefore transmitted . The intensity transmitted must , of course , be less than 50% of the incident light and , with losses by reflection at the surfaces and absorption within the film , is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double refraction by an anisotropic medium . A ray of unpolarised or polarised light incident onto an isotropic medium such as glass obeys the laws of refraction , including Snell 's law that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is a constant for a particular wavelength and pair of media . If , however , a ray is incident onto an anisotropic medium , for example , a rhombohedral crystal of calcite , the refraction laws are not simply obeyed . The atoms that make up the crystal lattice of an anisotropic material are arranged differently in different directions through the crystal . Thus a ray of light inside the crystal sees ' a different configuration of atoms depending on the direction in which it is travelling . Moreover , the electric vibrations that make up the ray of light interact differently with the atoms of the crystal lattice , depending on the relative orientation of the electric-vibration direction with the lattice . A crystal of anisotropic material splits an unpolarised beam into two components that have their directions of electric vibration at right angles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the crystal lattice generally cause the two components to take different ray paths . The two rays are both plane polarised . One ray , termed the ordinary , or 0-ray , obeys the ordinary laws of refraction . This component always has its electric-vibratior direction perpendicular to a particular direction in the crystal , called the optic axis . In crystals such as calcite there is only one direction of the optic axis and such crystals are therefore termed uniaxial . Another group of crystals having two optic axes , biaxial crystals , produce more-complicated optical effects . It should , however , be emphasised that the optic axis is a direction through the crystal , not a line as its name might imply . The direction of electric vibration of the other component of the original ray , the extraordinary or E-ray , is inclined at an angle to the optic axis which depends on the crystal face and angle of incidence used . The E-ray does not obey the simple laws of refraction : it may not be refracted in the plane of incidence and does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the crystal depending on its direction of travel , with its extreme velocity occurring when its electric-vibration direction is parallel to the direction of the optic axis . For sodium yellow light of wavelength 5.89 x 10- ' m , the refractive index for the 0-ray in calcite is no = 1.658 and the refractive index for the E-ray varies between 1.658 and an extreme value , nE = 1.486 . The difference between the extreme values ( nE ? no ) = 1.486 ? 1.658 = ? 0.172 . Calcite is therefore said to be a negative crystal , with a birefringence of 0.172 ( for A = 5.89 x 10-7 m ) . Quartz , for example , is a positive crystal as nE no . By isolating either the 0-ray or the E-ray , a plane-polarised beam can be obtained with little wasted intensity and without any coloration . The rays can be isolated by means of a polarising prism . In this , one of the rays is removed by total internal reflection , leaving a single planepolarised beam . The earliest design was a Nicol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Glan Thompson prism . A piece of calcite is cut generally into a rectangular block , although the earlier designs of prism usually had a rhombohedral form , with the optic axis having a specified direction through the block , depending on the particular design . The crystal block is then cut in half along a diagonal , the cut surfaces polished flat , and the two halves cemented together with Canada balsam . Canada balsam has a refractive index approximately midway between the extreme refractive indices , no and nE , for the calcite . The dimensions of the block are chosen such that one of the plane-polarised components will be transmitted through the block whilst the other is totally reflected at the calcite/balsam interface and thus effectively removed . The earlier design of Nicol prism had a sideto-length ratio of about 1:21 and an angle of useful aperture of about 22 ? . It also had a rhombic cross-section and slanting end faces which were a disadvantage , particularly the slanting end faces because they produced some elliptical polarisation . A Glan Thompson prism , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lengthwise direction . It gives complete plane polarisation of the transmitted light and has a side-to-length ratio of about 1:3 with an aperture of about 30 ? . The Glan Thompson prism is about the best of the designs that have superseded the original Nicol prism . 3.8 Wave Plates Wave plates or retarders ' convert one form of polarised light to another . For example , a beam of plane-polarised light may be converted // into circularly or elliptically polarised light , or vice versa , or the plane of polarisation may be rotated . Unfortunately , wave plates suffer from chromatism , that is , the magnitude of the change depends on wavelength . They should , therefore , only be used with monochromatic light . Wave plates divide incident plane-polarised light into two components , slow down one component relative to the other ? that is , they introduce a phase difference between the components ? and then allow them to recombine . Figure 3.10 shows a double-refracting plate cut with its optic axis as shown . An incident plane-polarised beam will be figure split into two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component having its electric-vibration direction perpendicular to the optic axis and the E-ray component having its electric-vibration direction parallel to the optic axis . The two rays then travel at different speeds . If the plate is made of calcite , the 0-ray travels slower and the direction of its vibration is therefore termed the slow axis , as in the figure . The other axis is correspondingly termed the fast axis . In practice , calcite is so highly birefringent that the plates are too thin and fragile and therefore quartz or mica is used . If the plate has a thickness t , the optical path difference introduced between the two components will be t ( no ? nE ) . The corresponding phase difference is thus // This may be conveniently rewritten as where t is the thickness of the plate required to produce a phase change S using monochromatic light of wavelength X. The two mutually perpendicular plane-polarised components may then be combined vectorially as in Section 3.6 and Figure 3.7 . A plate that introduces a phase change of 7r , or a half-wave retardation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident normally onto a half-wave retardation plate with its plane of polarisation at an angle 0 to one of the plate axes , may be considered as made up of two components at right angles and of the same phase , as in Figure 3.11 ( a ) . After passing through the retardation plate , the slow ray has been retarded half a wavelength and is lagging 7r in phase ; it may therefore be represented vectorially as in Figure 3.11 ( b ) , where the Y-component is shown rotated through 180 ? . Thus the resultant transmitted beam has had its vibration direction ? that is , its plane of polarisation ? rotated through an angle 20 . In particular , a plane-polarised beam with its plane of polarisation inclined at 45 ? to one of the plate axes will be rotated through 90 ? . The plate will also convert right-handed circularly or elliptically polarised light into the left-handed circular or elliptical form , or vice versa . Incident beam // Similarly a quarter-wave plate will introduce a phase difference of 1r/2 . The transmitted beam is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7r/2 out of phase . That is , the resultant vibration is an ellipse and becomes a circle only if the two components have equal amplitudes as when the plate axes make angles of 45 ? with the vibration direction of the incident plane-polarised beam . Conversely , a quarter-wave plate may be used to convert elliptically or circularly polarised light into plane-polarised light . 3.9 Applications of Polarised Light Perhaps the most common application is that of polarising sunglasses . In sunlight the main source of light is overhead and the most brightly illuminated surfaces are horizontal . The bright surfaces are generally viewed obliquely , near the Brewster angle , so that the reflected light is partially plane polarised with its electric-vibration direction mainly horizontal . In polarising sunglasses the lenses are of a dichroic material orientated to absorb this horizontal vibration and to transmit only vertical components . When the angle of reflection is nowhere near the Brewster angle , there is no polarisation by reflection . This situation is of especial interest , for example , to radar operators who are looking for faint spots on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mask these faint spots . To stop these reflections , a circular polariser plate is used , consisting of a linear polariser and a quarter-wave plate together , in front of the oscilloscope screen . Light from the room passing through the plate is converted from unpolarised light into circularly polarised light , say , right-hand circularly polarised . This light is reflected from the oscilloscope screen but now as left-hand circularly polarised because the direction of circular polarisation is defined with respect to the ray direction . Therefore , on reversing the ray direction , the direction of circular polarisation appears reversed . This reflected left-hand circularly polarised light is then totally absorbed by the circular polariser plate because this transmits right-hand circularly polarised light . About 99% of the room light that was reflected from the oscilloscope screen is absorbed , whereas nearly half the wanted light from the screen is transmitted . In addition , to ensure that room light is not reflected from the circular polariser itself , it must be tilted at an angle to the viewing direction . // A method involving photoelastic analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are to be subjected to strain . In this method a model of the part to be studied is made from transparent plastic and placed between crossed polarisers . Polarisers are said to be crossed when the second one is rotated through 90 ? so as to extinguish the plane-polarised beam transmitted by the first . On looking through the assembly , only a dark field is seen . The plastic model is now subjected to forces similar to those which would be applied to the actual part under use but suitably scaled down . Light and dark coloured areas are seen in the model as molecules of the plastic are distorted by the applied stress and the plastic becomes birefringent , acting as a retardation plate . The amount of birefringence introduced at each point in the model is a measure of the strain occurring at that point and the two axes of the retarder at each point are parallel and perpendicular to the directions of the strain at that point . Thus the points of greatest strain are points of greatest retardation , resulting in the greatest mismatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most light being transmitted . The measurement of the actual strain in a particular region may be made in several ways . Calibrated retarders may be used to cancel out the retardation introduced by strain in the model and hence give a measure of the retardation introduced . From subsidiary experiments on models of simpler shape the relation between strain and retardation , that is , the stress ? optic constant , may be determined . Alternatively , it is possible to determine the retardation from the colour of the fringe at a particular point , since retardation depends on wavelength and the assembly may be illuminated by white light . This method , however , is at its most useful when , rather than for determining actual values , it is used to locate the points of maximum strain so that the structure may be strengthened at these points . Photoelastic strain gauges are also used in the measurement of strain . The principle is the same as that for the photoelastic stress analysis method but , instead of making a model in plastic of the body under test , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 3.12 . The clear plastic is cemented into position with a reflecting cement . Since the light passes twice through the plastic , the sensitivity for a given thickness is doubled . As the body is strained , the plastic film also becomes strained and birefringent , giving a relative retardation between the two rays produced within the plastic . The amount of birefringence and consequent relative retardation is a measure of the strain , as just // discussed . Photoelastic strain gauges have an advantage over the more usual resistance type strain gauges in that they examine the strain over an area rather than at a point . A disadvantage is that they can measure only surface strains that are also accessible to light . Other materials show strain birefringence as , for example , glass . By examining glass between crossed polarisers it is easy to determine whether it has been correctly annealed and hence is strain-free . If it is not , the strain may relieve itself in time by causing the glass to fracture . A more specialised scientific use of polarised light is connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , a sugar solution , have the property of rotating the plane of polarisation without changing the character of the linear vibrations . The rotation of the plane of polarisation depends on the distance travelled through the solution and the concentration of sugar . A polarimeter is an instrument for measuring this rotation . It contains a glass cell of known length and , with the solution in the cell , plane-polarised light is shone through it and the amount of rotation of the plane of polarisation is measured by a suitably sensitive analyser . The strength of the sugar solution may be determined if the instrument has previously been calibrated . Two plane-polarisers inclined at a variable angle to each other may also be used to produce a variable density filter . Figure 3.13 shows the transmission planes of a polariser and analyser , for example , two sheets of Polaroid , inclined at an angle 0 to each other . Let A be the amplitude of the vibration transmitted by the polariser . This is resolved into two components at the analyser . One component , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right angles to the transmission plane of the analyser and is therefore absorbed . The other component , of amplitude A2 , has its vibration direction parallel to the analyser transmission plane and is therefore transmitted . This transmitted amplitudeA2 is equal to figure A cos 0 and therefore the transmitted intensity , which is proportional to the square of the amplitude , varies as the square of the cosine of the angle between the transmission directions of the polariser and analyser. 3.10 Ellipsometry Ellipsometry is a technique by which the thickness of thin films on metal may be determined , for example , a thin oxide film . The method is capable of determining thicknesses as small as 2 x 10 10 m but the computation is sufficiently laborious and complex to be impractical without the aid of a computer . The optical arrangement is shown in Figure 3.14 . To be able to determine the thickness it is first necessary to know the optical constants of the substrate . These are found using the arrangement shown in the figure together with a specimen free of any overlying film . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by adjusting the relative orientations of the polariser and quarter-wave plate , the reflected light may be made plane polarised and extinguished by the analyser . The quarter-wave plate is first set with its fast axis at 45 ? to the plane of incidence . The orientations of the polariser and analyser , P and A respectively , are found for extinction . // The polariser is rotated through 90 ? and a second extinction position found , corresponding to an analyser orientation A ' . All the angles are measured with respect to the plane of incidence with a clockwise rotation in the direction of propagation being regarded as positive . The reflected polarised light may be regarded as made up of two components , one with its electric-vibration direction parallel to the plane of incidence and the other with its vibration direction perpendicular . Then it may be shown that the relative phase change , A , between these two waves , on reflection is given by figure where 5 ' is the retardation produced by the quarter-wave plate . Also , from fi can be found , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amplitude ratio of the two plane wave components on reflection . If 0 is the angle of incidence of the beam on the specimen , the refractive index n and the absorption coefficient k of the substrate can be calculated from // The complex refractive index , n3 , for the substrate is then given by n3 = n ? ik ( 3.27 ) The values of tan and A for the substrate covered by the film under investigation are also determined for various unknown thicknesses of film . It may also be shown that the ratio of the complex reflectances of the film for the two plane-polarised c where the subscripts 1 , 2 , and 3 refer to the surrounding medium , film , and substrate respectively and the i 's , the complex Fresnel coefficients , are defined by where the p and s subscripts refer to the parallel and normal components of the reflected wave . The complex refractive index , n3 , for the substrate has already been determined , hi , the complex refractive index of the surrounding medium , usually air , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of n2 for the film . Here ( / ) I , 02 , and 03 are the angles of propagation of the reflected beam in the surrounding medium , film , and substrate respectively . These angles are also generally complex and are related by // Using a series of estimated values for the complex refractive index of the film , that is , n2 , values of Rp/RS can be computed from equation 3.28 for a series of values of thickness t . IRp/RSI then represents the relative amplitude change , tan IIi , of the parallel and normal components of the reflected wave and arg Rp/RS represents the relative phase change , A , of these components . The series of computed values can thus be plotted in the complex plane in the form tan against A for each estimated value of n2 , with the thicknesses t being marked off along each curve . The experimental values of tan L and A determined for a series of thicknesses of the film are also plotted and compared with the series of theoretical curves . A match between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complex refractive index of the film is that of the theoretical curve . The thickness of an individual film is then determined directly from the appropriate refractive index curve . Four MICROSCOPY OPTICAL MICROSCOPY 4.1 The Optical Microscope In a microscope , the objective which is a compound lens system is used to produce a magnified , real , inverted image . This image is then further magnified to produce a virtual image at the near point ? that is , at about 250 mm from the eye , as in Figure 4.1 . Since both the objective and eyepiece are compound lens systems , the rays are drawn with reference to the principal planes . Thus , rays may be drawn from a small object of height y to pass through the first and second principal foci F ? and F ? ' of the objective to form a real image of heighty ' . The image of height y ' is then further magnified by the eyepiece , which behaves as a simple magnifier . If the final image is to be formed at infinity , y ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyepiece . In practice , the microscope is normally adjusted to form the final image at the near point , taken to be about 250 mm from the eye . This means that the image y ' is located just inside the principal focus FE of the eyepiece . The lateral magnification produced by the objective is thus where fo is the focal length of the objective and 1 is the optical tube length . The optical tube length is defined as the distance between the back focal plane of the objective and the first focal plane of the eyepiece , which is approximately equal to the distance to the intermediate image y ' . The eyepiece behaves as a simple magnifier and hence has a magnifying power equal to 127 // where D is the least distance of distinct vision and fE is the focal length of the eyepiece . The total magnification of the microscope is then Mp x ME . Microscope objectives are normally manufactured with powers of x5 , xlO , x20 , x40 , and xlOO and eyepieces with powers of x5 , xlO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as a nominal value . Therefore , if the magnification is required to be known with greater accuracy so that the size of an object may be measured , a divided graticule is located at the plane of y ' and an object of known length is used . This length can then be measured in terms of the graticule divisions and hence the graticule can be calibrated . The mechanical tube length is the actual length of the microscope tube as measured from the top , where the shoulder of the eyepiece rests , to the bottom , where the shoulder on the screw-in objective locates . This has been standardised at 160 mm . Generally the mechanical and optical tube lengths are approximately the same . The thread on the // objective mount has also been standardised by the Royal Microscopical Society . Since the diameter of the eyepiece is also standardised , most eyepieces and objectives by different manufacturers should be interchangeable . The parfocal distance is the distance from the object to the bottom of the microscope tube where the objective fits . This distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of a different power the object will be kept approximately in focus . This distance , however , is not standardised , so that objectives supplied with different microfocal plane of the objective in the correct position with reference to the microscope and the position of the object , the lenses are suitably positioned within the objective jacket . Owing to the highest possible resolution being required , a microscope objective must be as free as possible from aberrations . The design problems are , however , aggravated by the very steep angles involved and the large curvature of the lens surfaces necessary with high magnifaction , up to xlOO , and the requirement of a high light-gathering power . Figure 4.2 shows typical lens arrangements for high- , medium- , and lowpower objectives . With a x100 objective , the working distance , that is , the distance between the first lens surface and the object , is about 025 mm . Consequently much of the light coming from the object will meet the first lens surface at grazing incidence and will thus be lost by reflection instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide angle cone of rays may enter the objective to give maximum light intensity and resolution , it is necessary to have a film of oil of the same refractive index as the objective 's first lens so as to bridge the gap // between the object and the first lens surface , that is , the object space and the first lens are made optically homogeneous . The oil used is generally cedar oil of refractive index about 1.517 for sodium yellow light . After use an oil-immersion objective must be cleaned by wiping off the oil with lens tissue ; occasionally extra cleaning may be required and in this case the tissue may be moistened with xylene , but never alcohol . This oil film is also important in reducing the aberrations of the objective in the following way . It can be shown that the condition for the formation of a perfect image of a small lateral object centred on the axis of a lens system is given by Abbe 's sine condition : that the ratio of the sines of the angles made with the axis by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , irrespective of the sizes of the angles involved . If a lens obeys this condition , then the image formed will be free from any spherical aberration . If the condition is also satisfied for an off-axis object so that the lateral magnification for all zones of the lens is constant , then the lens will also be free from coma . If an image free from both coma and spherical aberration for all zones can be formed for one particular object point , the system is said to be aplanatic . In practice , however , this term is often applied if these aberrations are eliminated for just one zone . In particular , a sphere is truly aplanatic for a particular pair of conjugate object and image points ; these points are shown in Figure 4.3 where the sphere has a radius r and refractive index n , surrounded by a medium of refractive // index n ' . By application of the thin-lens formula with the New Cartesian sign convention , and where v and u , the image and object distances , are as shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at A such that AO = r/n gives rise to an image at B , such that BO = nr . Also , from the figure , and since LBOC = LAOC the triangles BOC and COA are similar . Therefore = 0 ' and IP = 0 . Then ' by Snell 's law . Equation 4.5 also shows that the ratio of the sines of the angles tiff and , the angles made with the axis by a pair of corresponding object and image rays , is a constant . That is , the Abbe sine condition is satisfied and the sphere is aplanatic for the two points A and B. This property of the sphere is utilised in the front lenses of highpower microscope objectives . The object can not , of course , be embedded in a glass sphere but , by grinding part of the sphere away and using a drop of oil of the same refractive index as the glass between the glass and the specimen , the required optical condition can be achieved . If the rays diverging from the image at B are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.4 , in which the centre of curvature of the // first surface is at B , these rays will not be deviated since they are incident normally to the surface . If also the second surface of the meniscus lens is of such a radius of curvature that B is at its first aplanatic point , these rays will be refracted again without spherical aberration or coma and appear to come from the second aplanatic point , C , for this surface . In such an arrangement , which follows the design first suggested by Amici , magnification is thus achieved by both lenses aplanatically . Unfortunately this process can not be carried on further owing to the increasing amount of chromatic aberration . Later lenses in the system are then used to give greater magnification and to compensate for the chromatic aberration introduced by the Amici front and the oil , which has a different dispersion to the glass . Medium-power lenses , such as the x40 shown in Figure 4.2 , do not use oil immersion and since , for practical reasons , the first surface must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The middle and back lens components again are used to give further magnification but also have to compensate for the spherical aberration and chromatic aberration introduced by the front . Biological and other delicate specimens are usually embedded in Canada balsam and protected by a cover glass as in Figure 4.5 . Canada balsam is used since it has a refractive index approximately the same as that of the glass . Unfortunately , however , the parallel cover glass and balsam layer introduce spherical aberration . It is necessary , therefore , at least for the higher powers , to have different objectives corrected for use with covered or uncovered objects . To correct for variations in cover glass and balsam thickness , the draw tube , which is the tube into // which the eyepiece drops , is made movable so that the mechanical tube length may be changed from its nominal 160 mm ; by shortening the tube length , for example , the spherical aberration resulting from too thick a cover glass can be compensated . With a x100 objective corrected for a standard cover-glass thickness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 0.04 mm will give a noticeable deterioration in the image unless compensated for by adjusting the tube length . Having produced a magnified image of an object with an objective lens , an eyepiece is then required to magnify this image further . Two types of eyepiece are in general use . These are the Huygenian and the Ramsden types and they have already been described in Section 2.9 . There is , however , a limit to the magnification that should be used . Beyond a certain magnification , set by the resolution in the instrument , no further information is added to the image . It is therefore important to the microscopist to know the highest resolution that can be obtained . 4.2 Resolving Power of a Microscope Owing to the method of illumination of an object under a microscope , the object can to a first approximation be regarded as being selfluminous . Thus , if two neighbouring small objects are viewed through a microscope , their images are in fact two circular diffraction patterns produced by the circular apertures involved . In Figure 4.6 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective and is a distance R from the objective image plane . Since the distance R is large compared with the distance between the objective exit pupil and the objective or the object plane , this exit pupil may be regarded as the aperture which produces the diffraction . Two small self-luminous point objects A and B situated a distance y apart are then imaged as two circular diffraction patterns centred at A ' and B ' , a distance y ' apart . According to the Rayleigh criterion for resolution , the point objects A and B are only just resolvable as two point objects if the central maximum of one diffraction pattern , say at A ' , coincides with the position of the first diffraction minimum of the other pattern centred at B ' , as in Figure 4.7 That is , the distance A'B ' = y ' must be equal to the radius of the central bright disc , termed Airy 's disc , of either of the circular diffraction patterns , for A and B to be just resolvable . The angular radius of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objective make angles a and a ' with the axis ( Figure 4.6 ) , then a ' = ( a/2 ) /R and // The Abbe sine condition for perfect image formation for a particular wavelength X may be written as ny sin a = n ' y ' sin a ' ( 4.10 ) where n is the refractive index of the object space ( about 1.5 for an oilimmersion objective ) and n ' = 1 where the image space is in air . Thus , the distance between the objects A and B for them to be just resolvable is , where NA is the numerical aperture . In deriving this expression for the resolving power , it was assumed that the point objects A and B were self-luminous . This , however , is not strictly true . Abbe examined the problem and taking into account that the objects were illuminated by a condenser concluded that the factor of 0.61 in equation 4.12 should more correctly be 0.5 and therefore resolving power Assuming that the smallest angle that can be resolved by the eye under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.00058 rad ) , then two point objects which can only just be resolved with the microscope when they have a separation y will , on magnification , have an apparent separation y ' = 0.25 x 0.00058 m ( Figure 4.8 ) . The total magnification produced by the microscope is then // to allow for some spare magnification and where the mean wavelength of light is taken as 5 x 10-7 m . The numerical aperture NA is equal to n sin a . Sin a can not be greater than unity and with oil immersion ? that is , n = 1.5 ? the largest NA normally available is about 1.3 , using a xl00 objective . This gives the total magnification required to just resolve the two point objects as approximately 1000 times , which is obtainable with a x100 objective and a xl0 eyepiece . If the power of the eyepiece is increased , no more information is obtained and the image is less bright . The extra magnification is then termed empty ' magnification . Abbe has also shown that the resolution depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To realise the full resolution capabilities of the objective it is , therefore , necessary to use a condenser system that is sufficiently well corrected and with an NA comparable to that of the objective . 4.3 Condenser Systems for Microscopy To illuminate the object and provide bright field illumination conditions , a condensing system is required to concentrate the light . i // This system should be capable of focusing light from an external source to a point focus so that a cone of rays may diverge to fill almost the whole aperture of the objective uniformly with light . Figure 4.9 ( a ) shows the arrangement of an Abbe condenser which has a maximum NA of about 1.2 when used with oil immersion . A drop of oil is placed on top of the condenser which is then raised to meet the underside of the glass slide on which the specimen is mounted . Such an arrangement is , of course , only required for use with a x100 oil-immersion objective so that the space between the top lens of the condenser and the bottom lens of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specimen under examination ? there is no air layer . For lower-power objectives with lower numerical apertures , the system is used dry , that is , without oil . Some Abbe condensers are made with three lenses , with the top lens being removable for use with low-power systems . With an Abbe condenser , however , owing to its comparative optical simplicity , there is considerable spherical and chromatic aberration , although in the three-lens Abbe arrangement the spherical aberration may be reduced considerably . These aberrations may be corrected in an achromatic condenser Figure 4.9 ( b ) in which the design requirements are similar to those of the objective but the manufacturing tolerances are not so stringent . An iris diaphragm fitted below the condenser allows the numerical aperture to be adjusted to suit the objective being used . If the aperture of the condenser is reduced so that the NA of the illuminating cone is less than the NA of the objective , then the resolving power of the objective will be reduced . However , some reduction of the condenser aperture usually leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the object under investigation , a compromise has to be made between contrast and resolution . // If a condenser of greater NA than that of the objective is used , then , by stopping out a central cone of rays equal in NA to that of the objective , direct rays can be prevented from entering the microscope . However , if the field to be magnified is made up of a number of small objects capable of scattering , diffracting , or refracting the light in any way , then some of this light may enter the objective . These small objects are then seen as bright objects on a dark background instead of the more usual converse . The objects are made far more visible but they may be difficult to identify owing to diffraction effects . Besides a simple stop on the axis of the condenser , various systems have been designed to give oblique illumination without the wastage of light caused by a blank stop , as , for example , the design shown in Figure 4.9 ( c ) . 4.4 Setting-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be realised , then it is most important that all the optical components are in alignment and the illumination is correctly adjusted . To adjust the components for alignment it is usual to provide some type of centring arrangement for the condenser and its attached iris diaphragm , so that the condenser may be brought into alignment with the axis of the eyepiece and objective . An approximate method of alignment is to set up the microscope for low-power use , using a x10 objective , with the substage mirror adjusted to reflect light into the microscope tube as in Figure 4.10 . It should be noted that some microscope substage mirrors are plane on one side and concave on the other . Whenever a condenser is used the plane mirror must be utilised ; the concave side is only used for lowmagnification work when a condenser is not necessary . The microscope tube is now raised so that the objective is focused on a position about 30 mm above its normal position . An image of the aperture iris will then be seen when looking through the microscope . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusting the substage centring screws . The mirror is then tilted to give a central illumination of this image . A more accurate method of alignment requires the lamp and mirror to be adjusted first . With the condenser , objective , and eyepiece removed from the system and with a piece of ground glass or tissue paper resting on top of the microscope tube , the position of the lamp and mirror should be adjusted to direct the light up the tube to give a // centrally positioned patch of light on the ground glass screen . The condenser , objective , and eyepiece are now returned to their correct positions and the microscope focused on a specimen . The vertical position of the condenser is then adjusted to focus an image of the lamp iris diaphragm , the field iris , in the plane of the specimen . This image will then appear superimposed on the image of the specimen . If the image of the field iris does not appear central in the field of view , this is corrected by centring the substage unit holding the condenser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be altered . With the optical components now in alignment , the required method of illumination may be chosen and the microscope adjusted for optimum viewing conditions . Providing the substage centring screws are not interfered with , the alignment of the condenser , objective , and eyepiece will , of course , remain in adjustment . What must now be adjusted is the focus of the lamp , if it has a focusing system , and the opening of the field and aperture irises . Two types of illuminating conditions are in common use . These are critical illumination and Kohler illumination . For critical illumination the source of light is usually an opal lamp , or could be any diffuse source such as daylight , whereas Kohler illumination requires a source that can be focused to a small intense spot of light ( see Figure 4.10 ) . Critical illumination is suitable for low magnification but Kohler illumination is to be preferred in general // because it gives a greater intensity of light at the object and is therefore the most suitable for high magnification . It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred for photomicrography . With critical illumination the microscope , which is already in optical alignment , is focused on the specimen . The condenser is moved along the optic axis to focus onto the same plane as the specimen an image of the source and with it the field iris , so that the images of the specimen , source , and field iris will be superimposed . The tilt of the mirror is then adjusted to bring the image of the light source and field iris centrally into the field of view and the aperture of the field iris adjusted so that the light source only just fills the field of view . For low-power use it may be found preferable to defocus the condenser slightly to destroy the image of the source structure . The eyepiece should then be removed and looking down the microscope tube the opening of the aperture iris adjusted so that the back lens of the objective is just completely filled with light . This will give maximum resolution viewing but generally it will be found better to close the aperture iris until only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with light , to improve the contrast at the expense of resolution . With Kohler illumination the microscope is focused on an object as before and the condenser focused to produce an image of the field iris superimposed on the object . This image should be centred as before by adjusting the tilt of the mirror . The lamp condenser must now be focused to form an image of the lamp filament in the plane of the aperture iris , which will also be the position of the first focal plane of the substage condenser , as in Figure 4.10 ( b ) . The field of view should then be evenly illuminated . If it is not , then centring of the bulb filament by means of the lampholder centring screws is required . The field iris should then be closed down until it just encloses the field of view as before , and the opening of the aperture iris adjusted to fill between two-thirds and the whole of the aperture of the objective as viewed down the microscope tube with the eyepiece removed . This last adjustment is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different magnification , requiring a different objective to be used , the openings of the field and aperture irises must be readjusted . Although only transmission microscopes , that is , ones in which the illumination passes through the object , have been described , metallurgical microscopes are in common use . These are for use with opaque specimens and make use of a vertical illuminator . Light is brought into // the system through a side tube between the eyepiece and objective and reflected along the microscope axis by a half-silvered plate . Light thus passes down through the objective , which acts as a condenser , to illuminate the specimen and is then reflected back through the objective and passes straight through the half-silvered plate to the eyepiece . An alternative arrangement for use with opaque specimens is to invert the optical system completely , as in Figure 4.11 . This has the advantage that only the side of the specimen being examined need be flat and the specimen can be of any thickness . The lens A in the figure serves to make the plane of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the plane of the aperture iris conjugate with the exit pupil of the objective , allowing both field and aperture control to be exercised independently by the respective irises . Owing to the number of back reflections in the system , it is necessary for the lenses of objectives used with vertical illumination to have anti-reflection coatings . This is especially necessary since the general light level is low owing to absorption by the half-silvered beam divider and the generally low reflectivity of the specimen . 4.5 Polarised-light Microscopes Essentially a polarising microscope is a conventional bright-field microscope with the addition of a polariser and an analyser . Earlier // microscopes used calcite polarising prisms , such as the Nicol or Glan Thompson discussed in Section 3.7 , but modern microscopes use Polaroid type filters . The polariser is located below the substage condenser and allows only plane-polarised light to enter the system , whilst the analyser is located above the objective , generally just below the eyepiece , and is used to detect the polarised light . If the analyser and polariser are crossed , that is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polariser , then any depolarisation or rotation of the plane of polarisation produced by the object under examination will destroy the extinction condition in a localised region . Similarly any birefringence within the object , as is commonly the case in mineralogical specimens , will cause that region of the object to act as a retardation plate , as discussed in Section 3.8 , giving coloration due to interference effects . Thus an almost featureless object , perhaps a slice of rock ground down in thickness to become virtually transparent or perhaps a fibrous specimen , will show up between crossed polarisers as an object with light and dark features that may also be coloured . To achieve the full benefit of this type of viewing system , a number of microscope design features become of importance . The most important of these is the necessity for strain-free condensers and objectives . Any strain in these components will partially destroy the extinction condition of the crossed polarisers , giving light patches in an otherwise dark field . Therefore optical components for use with a polarising microscope should be specially selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polarising filters , usually the substage polariser , rotatable to give bright-field conditions when required , for example , when generally examining the specimen to select areas for more detailed study . To orientate the specimen with respect to the plane of polarisation produced by the substage polariser , the microscope should also be equipped with a rotating stage . This must be accurately centred so that the axis of rotation of the stage coincides with the optical axis of the microscope , otherwise an object in the centre of the field will not remain in the centre as it is rotated . The rotating stage is usually fitted with a degree scale enabling rotations to be measured . If small crystalline specimens are to be examined , it is generally essential to have a universal stage to enable the specimen to be tilted as well as rotated . Some specimens show up differently in parallel or convergent illumination and it is therefore desirable to be able to switch easily // between these two types of illumination . This is usually done by having a condenser with swing-out lenses . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a keyed eyepiece ? so that it can not be rotated ? which is fitted with a cross-line graticule showing the orientations of the transmission planes of the polariser and analyser ; and below the analyser should be a slot to allow the insertion of calibrated retardation plates into the beam . These can be quarter- or half-wave plates ( Section 3.8 ) or wedges , and are used to compensate for and thus measure the retardation produced by the specimen . For more accurate measurement of retardation , a Berek compensator should be used : this is a small calcite plate which may be tilted by a measured amount . The plate is cut so that its optic axis is normal to the plate and thus introduces no retardation when in a horizontal position . As it is tilted a retardation is introduced which is a function of the angle of tilt , which may be calibrated to read retardation directly . Further information concerning the specimen may be obtained by viewing its effect on light of varying obliquity . This is done by switching in a small lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which enables the polarised-light pattern at the exit pupil of the objective to be viewed , rather than the specimen itself . This is termed conoscopic observation in contrast to the usual orthoscopic observation . Conoscopic observation enables , for example , the angle between the optic axes of a biaxial crystal to be measured . A universal stage is now even more necessary , so that the specimen can be suitably orientated and accurate angular measurements made . 4.6 Phase-contrast and Interference Microscopy Most living cells or tissue show virtually no contrast when viewed under normal bright-field microscope conditions and therefore it is necessary to stain the specimen in some way to enhance the contrast between its different parts . This , however , may kill the cell or tissue or inhibit its natural functions . There is therefore a need to be able to examine the specimen without resorting to staining . Both phase-contrast and interference microscopy make this possible . Both systems are dependent on slight variations of refractive index within the specimen , which differs from the refractive index of the surrounding medium . In the phase-contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focal plane of the condenser is imaged in the rear focal plane of the // objective , as in Figure 4.12 . Thus , without an object in position , all the hollow cone of rays that pass through the clear substage annulus will pass through an annular region of the phase plate . If now an object is introduced , then some of the rays will be diffracted away from the ray paths shown in Figure 4.12 and will consequently pass through a different region of the phase plate and not through the annular region . Depending on the refractive index of each part of the object , there will be a varying optical thickness which will introduce corresponding phase differences in the light rays . That is , the object is regarded as a phase object rather than the usual amplitude object . A small object will produce a diffraction pattern consisting of a central maximum of intensity , the zero order , surrounded by a series of subsidiary maxima , of which the first-order maximum has the greatest intensity . The zero order , arising from the undiffracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase plate whilst the rays making up the firstand higher-order subsidiary maxima will fall outside this region . On average , the rays forming the first-order diffraction maximum are 7r/2 in phase , that is , a quarter wavelength , behind those making up the central maximum . If now the phase plate is coated with a layer that increases to it this retardation of the first-order diffracted rays relative to those of the zero order , then the zero- and first-order diffracted rays will be // out of step and will destructively interfere . Thus the diffracting object will appear dark against a bright field when surrounded by a lower refractive index medium . In practice , the annular region has deposited on it , by vacuum evaporation , a coating of magnesium fluoride and a metal . The plate is then protected by cementing on a glass cover . The thickness of the magnesium fluoride annulus is such that its optical thickness is a quarter wavelength less than that of the surrounding cement region , causing the zero-order rays to be a half wavelength in advance of the diffracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorption so that the amplitudes of the zero-order rays are reduced to be comparable to the amplitudes of the first-order rays and allow the destructive interference to be more nearly complete . This arrangement is termed dark ' or positive ' contrast because the phase object appears dark . Bright ' or negative ' contrast is the reverse of this and is produced by having a phase annulus that retards the zero-order rays by a quarter wavelength and brings them into step with the firstorder rays , resulting in constructive interference and the object appearing bright against a dark background . Interference microscopy works on very similar principles but does not use the object to introduce the separate interfering beams . Light passing through the object undergoes a retardation relative to light passing through a neighbouring clear region . On combining these separate beams , interference takes place and path differences are converted into intensity differences . There are various systems for producing the two separate beams . Perhaps the simplest in concept uses two matched objectives ? one focused on a flat reference mirror and the other on the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference takes place . An approximately similar arrangement has already been described in Section 3.3 for examining opaque objects . Here only one objective was used owing to sufficient working depth being available with the low-power objective to allow the beam splitter to be incorporated . This arrangement is not practical for higher powers ; using two objectives overcomes this difficulty but the higher the power the more prone the system is to vibration problems . A more stable design is to use double-refracting components to produce the two interfering beams . One design , for example , uses two calcite plates . One of these is located above the condenser to convert incident plane-polarised light into two mutually perpendicular planepolarised beams , one of which can pass through the object and the // other through a neighbouring region , and the other calcite plate is below the objective and serves to bring the two beams back into coincident paths , as in Figure 4.13 . The image formed is thus due to the superimposition of two different images of the object area , which are then interferometrically compared . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ index which is also a function of wavelength . Thus the image will be coloured which in turn will enhance the contrast . Before the two mutually perpendicular plane-polarised beams can be made to interfere , however , they must be converted to circularly polarised beams by a suitably orientated quarter-wave plate . The resultant of these beams of opposite rotation , a plane-polarised beam whose orientation depends on the phase relationship between the two circularly polarised beams , is then viewed through an analyser located below the eyepiece. 4.7 Photomicrography To obtain a photograph of the magnified image , a camera must be fitted to the microscope . The usual type of camera attachment is made // to clamp onto the top of the microscope tube . Some designs of camera include a beam splitter and a supplementary eyepiece that allows the object being photographed to be viewed at the same time . With this design , an image that appears in focus through the eyepiece should also be in focus at the film plane of the camera . However , the eye is capable of accommodating some degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image formed on the film and therefore considerable care is needed in focusing . The eyepiece is usually fitted with some form of graticule , such as a cross-line , and the microscope focused so that there is no parallax between the image as seen in the eyepiece and this graticule . The image field in many microscope systems is slightly curved and therefore if it is sharply in focus at the centre of the field it will be slightly out of focus at the edges of the field . To accommodate this curvature on a flat photographic film or plate , a point a little way offcentre may be taken as the point for sharp focusing so as to obtain a more acceptable photograph . To check that the focal plane of the eyepiece , as defined by the eyepiece graticule , is optically coincident with that of the camera , a piece of ground glass should be placed in the film or plate position in the camera so that the ground side is towards the incoming rays . The microscope should then be focused to form a sharp image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of the eye , a magnifying glass can be used to view the ground glass screen and the sharpness of the focus . If the image seen through the supplementary eyepiece is not then also sharply in focus , adjustments should be made to the position of this eyepiece . The other problem of photomicrography is determining the exposure time which from a practical point of view should be as short as possible to reduce the effects of vibration . The illumination system therefore should be carefully adjusted to obtain the optimum conditions as , in particular , any unevenness in the illumination is especially noticeable in this type of photography . With a little experience , based on a few test photographs , reliable estimates of the exposure times can soon be made . If the conditions are changed , however , it should be remembered that the exposure time varies as the square of the magnification and inversely as the square of the usable numerical aperture of the illuminating cone of light . It also varies inversely as the ASA rating of the film . Further control is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increase in the voltage of a filament lamp by 25% will approximately halve the required exposure time . However , varying the // brightness of the source in this way will affect its colour temperature which may become of importance when using colour film . Generally a blue or daylight ' filter is required to improve the colour balance . Exposure meters are also available for use with microscope cameras . ELECTRON MICROSCOPY 4.8 The Electron Microscope The importance of an electron microscope is not so much the very high magnifications that are attainable but the very high resolutions coupled with these magnifications , so making them useful ' magnifications . It was shown in Section 4.2 that the resolving power of an optical microscope is limited to approximately half the wavelength of the light used and it is therefore necessary to decrease this wavelength before any improvement may be gained . Little , however , can be gained by mere reduction to , say , ultraviolet light wavelengths as in fluorescent microscopy , owing to the increased manufacturing difficulties partially offsetting the possible gain in resolution . To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a radiation of significantly shorter wavelength , as for example electron radiation . This is more practicable than using , say , X-rays , as electrons can be focused by electric and magnetic fields whereas X-rays can only be focused by techniques involving reflection at glancing incidence . Electrons have both particle- and wave-like properties . The ability of an electron microscope to form an image of an object depends on the particle-like properties of the electron , since it is these properties that determine the trajectories through the electric and magnetic fields . The wave-like properties , however , are of importance in relation to the resolution of the microscope . As was first postulated by de Broglie , the wavelength associated with an electron is ( 4.14 ) my where h is Planck 's constant , 6.626 x 10-m J s , m is the mass of the electron , and v its velocity . This velocity is acquired by accelerating // the electron through a potential difference E , which gives it a kinetic energy where e is the charge on the electron , that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wavelength can be determined as a function of the accelerating voltage E. Owing to the high velocities involved , the relativistic change in mass should be taken into account , that is , the electron mass m is given by where m ? is the rest mass of the electron , 9.108 x 10 31 kg , and c the velocity of light in vacuum , 2.998 x 108 m s 1 . In practice , however , the obtainable resolution is limited by the difficulties in design and manufacture of the electrostatic and magnetic focusing lenses , which limit the resolution of commercial instruments to a minimum resolvable distance of about 2 ? 3 x 10-10 m . With these instruments , magnifications up to about 500000 times are generally possible , depending on the particular design . However , instruments with resolutions of perhaps 10 ? 20 x 10-10 m and lower magnifications are adequate for many purposes and are additionally much lower priced than the highestresolution instruments . Although much larger electron microscopes can be built with much higher accelerating voltages and higher resolutions , the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A high-magnification instrument must also be capable of producing a range of magnifications to deal with various problems and should also be capable of very low magnifications , perhaps 100 ? 200 times , to allow the general shape of the specimen to be seen and a particular area selected for close examination . The electrons are obtained from a hot wire filament and then accelerated by a powerful electric field exerted by a charged metal plate to which is applied a potential of perhaps 50 kV , depending on the particular microscope design and power . This accelerating electrode has a small hole in it to allow a narrow beam of electrons to enter the main electron optical system . A system of electromagnetic lenses directs these electrons onto the object to be examined . The object , which must be thin enough to be partially transparent to the electrons , scatters the electrons from their normal path . Further electromagnetic lenses focus these electrons onto a fluorescent screen to form a visual image . This // fluorescent screen may be replaced by a photographic plate if a permanent record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the complete electron microscope optics including the specimen under examination to be under high vacuum to prevent the electrons being scattered by the gas molecules . Thus , associated with the complete electron microscope system there must be a rotary pump and diffusion pump assembly for continuous evacuation of the electron optics column . An air-lock is therefore required to enable the specimen to be inserted . A typical arrangement of electron microscope lenses is shown in // lenses are the same as for a normal light microscope , whilst the intermediate and projector lenses serve a similar function to the eyepiece , and the filament and anode assembly take the place of a light source . The anode is at earth potential so that the accelerating field is obtained by applying to the filament a voltage of up to about 100 kV , depending on the particular microscope and the resolution and magnification required . A small current is supplied to the filament to heat it and so cause electrons to be emitted . This current will thus control the brightness of the final image . In many designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain better stabilisation of the electron beam . The lenses themselves are usually a coil in a soft iron casing , as shown in Figure 4.15 . As well as the main focusing coil , smaller supplementary coils , termed stigmator coils , are used to produce radial rather than axial magnetic fields . These are used to correct for astigmatism . The design of the pole-pieces allows very high magnetic fields to be obtained , giving lenses with a focal length of the order of 1 mm . To obtain these short focal lengths coupled with a sufficient freedom from aberrations , the lenses and their pole-pieces have to be very carefully designed and manufactured to very close tolerances . Various size apertures , with the smallest having a clear diameter of about 2 x 10-s m , may be inserted by the microscope user . These serve similar functions to the apertures used in optical microscopy , such as controlling resolution and illumination , and limiting the field . The objective lens is used to produce a magnified real image , termed the intermediate image , at the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of this image are then focused by the projector lens to form a magnified image on the fluorescent screen . The maximum magnification produced by the projector lens is similar to // that which may be produced by the objective lens but its lowest magnification is usually considerably lower than that of the corresponding objective lens . The varying magnification and focusing conditions in a particular electron microscope are obtained by altering the current through the appropriate lens coils . The image formed on the fluorescent screen may then be viewed directly or through a low-power binocular microscope . To obtain a photograph of the image , the fluorescent screen is rotated to one side to uncover the photographic film or plate . As well as the transmission electron microscopes with magnetic focusing , microscopes have also been manufactured with electrostatic focusing systems . Although electrostatic lenses are simpler and cheaper to construct , it has not proved possible to obtain such high magnifications and resolutions as with magnetic focusing systems . In dark-field optical microscopy the direct rays are eliminated and the image is produced by light scattered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electron microscopy . The electron beam leaving the condenser lenses is deflected by a few degrees , perhaps 3 ? , from its axial path and is thus prevented from passing directly into the objective lens . With an object in the beam , however , some electrons will be scattered back into the objective and transmitted through the following lenses to produce a dark-field image of the object . It has already been said that the specimen under examination must be partially transparent to electrons and therefore it must be thinned in some way if necessary or a replica taken if the surface is to be examined . An alternative arrangement is to use a reflection system so that opaque objects may be studied . The usual method is to fit a special specimen holder and beam deflecting coils to a conventional transmission electron microscope . The specimen is mounted parallel and to one side of the axial electron beam path . Supplementary coils are used to produce a magnetic field that deflects the electron beam from its axial path and onto the specimen . Scattered electrons from the specimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objective and following lenses . The angle of incidence , as measured between the electron beam and the specimen surface , varies with the microscope design and may also be varied by the microscope user , but is generally only a few degrees , perhaps 10 ? , although some microscopes have been built to provide angles of incidence about two or three times this amount . Generally , however , reflection electron microscopy can only be regarded as viewing the specimen at grazing incidence . The resolution // is also about two orders poorer than can be obtained with the same microscope when used for transmission microscopy . An electron microscope may also be used to produce a diffraction pattern of a small area of the object under examination . This diffraction pattern can be used to obtain information concerning the crystal structure and orientation of the object . To select the area for diffraction examination , an aperture is inserted between the intermediate lens and the objective ( Figure 4.16 ) . The intermediate-lens current is adjusted to focus this aperture onto the screen , with the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the specimen for examination . The specimen in turn is focused on the screen by adjusting the objective-lens current . This means that the intermediate image of the specimen is now formed in the same plane as the areaselecting aperture , with the aperture isolating a small area in the plane of the specimen . The condenser should then be defocused to obtain parallel beam illumination of the specimen , as in Figure 4.16(b) , and the focusing of the intermediate lens adjusted to produce an image on the screen of the back focal plane of the objective . A diffraction pattern consisting of concentric rings or spots will then be seen on the screen if // the specimen area under examination is at all crystalline . Concentric rings indicate a large number of very small crystals with random orientations , with the radii of the rings being a function of the lattice spacings , whilst a spotty pattern indicates relatively few , or even a single crystal , with the arrangement of spots being indicative of the crystallographic orientation . A scanning electron microscope works on slightly different principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . The conventional microscope is designed to give high magnification whereas the scanning version sacrifices high magnification and resolution to gain greater depth of focus and the facility to examine the surface of relatively large opaque specimens , perhaps 50 mm in diameter . Topographical features are thus shown in sharp relief , giving an impression of stereoscopic vision . The range of magnification is perhaps 20 to 50000 times , although many instruments have a much lower top magnification than this , with perhaps a typical resolution of 2 x 10-7 m . Many instruments are , however , able to resolve much smaller distances than this . In the scanning electron microscope , the first and second condenser lenses and the projector lens are used to project a much demagnified electron beam onto the specimen , as in Figure 4.17 . The projector lens also incorporates supplementary lenses for astigmatism correction . The probe beam , with a diameter of about 10 8 m , is then made to scan line after line across the specimen by suitably placed scanning coils . An image of the surface can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a television screen which is scanned in synchronisation with the electron probe scan . The bombardment of the specimen surface by the high-intensity electron beam causes secondary electrons to be emitted from the specimen . If the front surface of the electron collector is positively biased , these secondary electrons will be attracted to the collector and recorded . The microscope is then said to be working in an emissive mode . The efficiency of production of the secondary electrons depends on the local contours of the specimen surface , which will be recorded as a varying intensity by the electron collector and displayed on the television tube in synchronisation . If the front surface of the electron collector is negatively biased , the microscope is said to be working in a reflective mode . With some specimens the highintensity electron probe excites luminescence , in which case the image may be recorded by a photomultiplier tube . An alternative method of obtaining an image is to use the microscope in a conductive mode . With this , varying electron currents produced in the specimen are collected and amplified , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanning probe beam as before . 4.9 Setting-up Procedure The maximum resolution obtainable with a particular electron microscope will depend on its design and the care taken in its manufacture . However , this maximum resolution can not be obtained unless the microscope is properly set up as the designers intended and , in particular , the optics are in proper alignment and the aberrations minimised . The precise setting-up procedure will depend on the // particular design and obviously the manufacturer 's instructions should be followed carefully . The design of the objective lens should ensure that the spherical aberration is sufficiently small , whilst the design of the electronics should ensure that the h.t. voltage on the filament and the current supplies to the various lenses are sufficiently stable to reduce the effects of chromatic aberration to within satisfactorily tolerable limits . Mechanical stability , owing to building vibrations , is dependent on the siting of the microscope and it is to be presumed that such an expensive instrument would not be sited where its designed performance could not be obtained . The same comment also applies to magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province of the operator are the general alignment of the various components , the choice of operating conditions , which will be dependent on the particular specimen to be examined , the correction of astigmatism of the objective lens , and finally the focusing of the image . Apart from a detrimental effect on the performance , a misaligned optical system will make the electron microscope difficult to use . For example , the illumination may not remain centred as the intensity is varied and the image may sweep across the field as the magnification or focusing is changed , with possibly a complete loss of view of the field being examined . The tilt of the electron gun , that is , the filament and its anode , must be adjusted to send the electron beam axially down the electron-optics column . The lateral position of each of the components must also be adjusted to lie on this same axis . Thus the electron-gun assembly must be traversed with respect to the condenser lens ; and the condenser lens and the electron-gun assembly must then be traversed with respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be traversed with respect to the objective lens . If the system includes an intermediate lens between the objective and projector lenses , then this also must be aligned with respect to the others . Reference should be made to the instrument 's instruction manual for the detailed method of alignment . The choice of operating conditions is governed by the nature of the specimen . A typical choice of accelerating voltages might be 40 , 60 , 80 , and 100 kV for a particular microscope . This range , however , is not large enough to give a sufficiently large change in wavelength and corresponding resolution to be of any practical significance . Therefore the choice of accelerating voltage is governed by the requirements for electron penetration of the specimen and for optimum contrast . // By varying the potential difference between the filament and anode and by adjusting the filament heating current , the electron beam current may be varied . This in turn will vary the intensity of illumination on the fluorescent viewing screen . The electron beam current , however , should be kept as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid heating damage to the specimen . Apertures must also be inserted by the operator . The illumination aperture ( Figure 4.14 ) is used to define the angular aperture of the illumination . The aperture is inserted in the second ( or only ) condenser lens and is effective at low condenser magnification . For high condenser magnifications the effective illumination aperture becomes smaller than the physical aperture but the physical aperture still serves to remove unwanted electrons that may be scattered from the main beam . The objective aperture is inserted near the back focal plane of the objective lens and serves to improve the contrast in the image by removing elastically scattered electrons . Although a smaller diameter aperture stop generally gives greater contrast , it is susceptible to the build-up of a layer of contamination on which an electrostatic charge accumulates and affects the symmetry of the electron beam . This increasing lack of symmetry must be corrected by use of the objective stigmator controls . To reduce the need for repeated astigmatic correction and frequent cleaning of the aperture stop , it is usual to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apertures to those occasions when the nature of the specimen makes them essential and for photography . The adjustments for the correction of astigmatism and for focus are obviously very critical , especially at high magnifications , if optimum performance is to be obtained . Adjustments are facilitated by using a thin scattering specimen in which there are some small holes , such as a thin carbon film . Interference will then occur between an electron beam passing through a hole and another beam passing through the scattering object , giving rise to Fresnel fringes around the edge of the hole . Owing to the finite size of the electron source , overlapping fringe systems are formed which blur the higher-order fringes into invisibility , leaving in general one fringe around the edge of the hole . The geometry for the formation of the fringes is such that they will disappear at focus , with the fringe spacing increasing from zero as the image becomes progressively more out of focus . To correct for astigmatism , therefore , the focus should be adjusted to produce a narrow fringe around , preferably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fringe around the hole will indicate astigmatism which must be compensated out by // adjustment of the stigmator current controls . It is generally necessary to observe the image formed on the fluorescent screen with the aid of the supplementary binocular microscope to obtain the highest accuracy in setting . Observation of the Fresnel fringes is also an ideal method for setting the focus , as the microscope will be correctly in focus when the Fresnel fringes disappear . If there is no hole in the specimen , then a sharp discontinuity of structure may sometimes be suitable . Many special attachments may be purchased for individual electron microscopes , for which the manufacturer 's instructions for setting up and using should be consulted . These can be , for example , special stages : a tilting stage allows the specimen to be tilted through a few degrees about one or two axes , whilst a goniometer stage allows a greater angle of tilt , generally in any direction , and also allows the specimen to be rotated . Some degree of tilt is especially useful for work with metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large changes in contrast . Stereoscopic pictures may also be obtained by recording the image on film , tilting the specimen through 5 ? to 10 ? , and then photographing the image again . The two films may then be viewed through a stereo-viewer . It is , however , necessary to rotate the pictures relative to each other to compensate for the rotation introduced by the microscope lens system as the object was tilted . Hot stages are also available which are able to heat the specimen up to about 800 ? C ; similarly , cold stages are able to cool the specimen to liquid nitrogen temperature . Liquid nitrogen cooled probes may also be inserted close to the specimen to induce the build-up of contamination on the probe rather than on the specimen . The contamination is due partly to the bombardment of the various surfaces by the electron beam , causing outgassing , but mainly to the interaction of the electron beam with organic molecules . The source of these organic molecules can be , for example , the oil in the diffusion and rotary pumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber 0-rings and gaskets , and even finger marks and metal surfaces that have been cleaned with organic solvents . 4.10 Specimen Preparation Methods of specimen preparation vary considerably and will obviously depend very much on the particular specimen and the type of information required . Thus only general methods can be dealt with here since // each specimen requires separate consideration . Specimens for reflection or scanning electron microscopy require little preparation in general other than polishing and etching in the case of metals . Specimens for transmission electron microscopy , however , usually require considerable preparation . Owing to the low penetrating properties of the electron beam , it is necessary to mount specimens for transmission examination on a small grid foil . Generally these grids are of copper but other metals , such as stainless steel and platinum , are used where special conditions , for example , high melting temperatures , are required . These grids are circular with a diameter of 3 mm , although some microscopes do use a 2.3 mm diameter grid , and have various mesh shapes and sizes depending on the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole in the grid is available for examination . Many specimens , such as fine powder grains , need to be supported by an electron-transparent film over the grid . The two most-preferred support films are of Formvar or of carbon , although other materials such as collodion ( nitrocellulose ) or evaporated silicon monoxide are occasionally used . Formvar ( polyvinyl formaldehyde ) films are made by dipping a microscope slide , which has been cleaned in detergent solution and polished with a cloth without rinsing in clean water , into a 0.3% w/v solution of Formvar in ethylene dichloride . The slide is removed from the solution and allowed to drain vertically onto a filter paper until dry . By lowering the slide slowly at a shallow angle into a dish of water , the film should separate from the glass by surface tension forces and float on the surface of the water . Various techniques may then be used to cut the Formvar film into small pieces and scoop them onto the grids . One method is to cut the film into small squares with a razor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickness for such a film is when it shows a pale straw interference colour in white light . A similar process is used with carbon films , which are produced by evaporating carbon onto the glass slide . A large current ( e.g. 50 A at 24 V ) is passed through carbon rods whilst in a vacuum system . The carbon rods should be spring loaded together and have a point contact . The arc produced at the contact is sufficient to vaporise the carbon and cause it to be vacuum evaporated . An evaporation time of about Is should be sufficient to produce a film of the correct thickness , which should appear light brown in colour . The film may then be floated off in water and scooped onto the grid as before . Having deposited the support film on the grid , the specimen to be // examined must then be deposited in turn onto the support film . The technique for this will depend on the specimen . Fine powder grains may be dispersed into a cloud by a jet of air , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grid and support film . Alternatively , it may be possible to produce a liquid suspension of the particles . A small drop of the suspension may then be placed on the grid and support film and allowed to dry , hence depositing the particles . The general problem is one of producing a satisfactory dispersion of the specimen over the supporting grid . Bulk specimens which are opaque to the electron beam must either be thinned down or a replica taken . The method of thinning down will depend very much on the nature of the specimen ; for example , biological and tissue specimens may require freezing and thin slices obtained with a microtome , whereas metal specimens may require thinning by acid etching . Many investigations , however , require a study of the surface features . These may be replicated and the replica examined under the microscope . Two basic techniques are used in making replicas . The first involves simply depositing a replicating material such as Formvar over the specimen , and then stripping it off Figure 4.18 ( b ) . The second technique involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the specimen and then stripped off . A further replica is then made of the first replica and it is this second replica that is examined in the electron microscope . As well as making a replica of the surface , these techniques allow small fragments to be ripped from the surface of the specimen and these fragments are then available for electron diffraction study . // Plastic replicas , however , give comparatively poor resolutions owing to their thickness . Contrast only arises owing to the small variation in thickness of a relatively thick layer . With evaporated film replicas a greater resolution can be obtained . Evaporated replicas consist of a film , for example , carbon , which is of almost constant thickness Figure 4.18 ( el . Contrast is thus produced by the changes in slope of the film , giving relatively large changes in the overall thickness . With a two-stage replica , the first could be a Formvar replica and the second an evaporated carbon replica . The plastic layer can then be dissolved away to leave the carbon replica . The contrast produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an electron-dense material such as a metal . This is done by evaporating the metal from a direction at a small angle to the surface . The effect is to produce shadows ' which accentuate the surface irregularities as in Figure 4.18 ( d ) . Five RADIOGRAPHY HEALTH PHYSICS 5.1 Safety Precautions When using X-rays or radioactive sources it is most important that close attention is given at all times to ensure that any health hazards are avoided . Not only the user must be protected but also any casual passerby . So the working area should be restricted to only those personnel who are familiar with the possible hazards and are judged competent to handle such radiation sources . Although in principle any exposure to X-rays or radioactive sources other than for medical purposes should be avoided , it is appreciated that accidents do occur and in rare cases , for example whilst rectifying a fault , it may even be necessary for a person to be exposed deliberately for a short time . However , there are government regulations which lay down maximum permissible doses for persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in permanent biological effects and possibly death . The problem of deciding what is a tolerable level of radiation is a difficult one in as much as different body cells react in different ways . Some lightly damaged cells , subjected to a small dose of radiation received over a short period , can be repaired naturally by the body , whereas even the smallest amount of radiation in the reproductive organs can lead to chromosome and gene damage resulting in mutations . There are thus varying acceptable dosages for the different organs . The problem is further complicated by the fact that different types of radiation may produce different effects on the same part of the body . A number of units have therefore been devised which try to take into account the effects produced by different radiations , as well as the differing effects on the various body organs . 162 // A unit of radiation exposure which is based on the quantity of radiation actually absorbed is the roentgen ( R ) . It is strictly applicable to only X- or y-radiation and is equivalent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x 10-4 C of charge of either sign . The exposure rate is usually in units of R h 1 or mR h 1 . The unit of absorbed dose is the rad . This is equivalent to an absorption of energy of 0.01 J kg-1 and is independent of the material irradiated . However , these units do not take into account the different biological effects of the various types of radiation . A new unit , therefore , was introduced ? the rem . This is the unit of dose equivalent and is the dose of any radiation that produces the same biological effect as one roentgen of X-rays . The rem , an abbreviation for Roentgen Equivalent Man , is the product of the absorbed dose , measured in rads , and any modifying factors such as the quality factor ( QF ) and the dose distribution factor ( DF ) . Other names are also given to these modifying biological factors . For example , the quality factor is also known as the relative biological effectiveness ( RBE ) and the distribution factor as the relative damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account how much of the energy lost by the radiation is transferred to the body , by considering the loss of energy per unit of path travelled . This is termed the linear energy transfer ( LET ) . The LET value depends not only on the type of radiation but also on its energy and obviously a greater LET value means a more biologically dangerous type of radiation . The LET value is incorporated into the quality factor by comparing the biological effect produced by the radiation with the biological effect produced by X-rays . Thus , if a dose of d rads of X-rays is required to produce the same biological effect as is produced by D rads of another radiation , this other radiation is said to have a QF of d/D . This means that X-rays have a QF of unity and that radiations with a high quality factor are relatively more damaging biologically . In fact 1 rad of alpha particles produces 20 times more biological damage than 1 rad of X-rays . However , it should be remembered that alpha and beta particles are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are , therefore , less likely to penetrate the skin and cause internal body damage . Values of the quality factor for various types of radiation are given in Table 5.1 . The distribution factor takes into account that there may be a nonuniform distribution of radiation over the body . Thus the DF will be unity for whole-body irradiation . It also takes into account that different body organs will be affected in varying ways , so that radiation localised to a particularly vulnerable area may be just as damaging as whole-body radiation . So the dose equivalent may be expressed as dose equivalent ( rems ) = absorbed dose ( rads ) x QF x DF ( 5.1 ) Maximum permissible radiation doses have been laid down for adults exposed in the course of their work . These maximum dosages , it is believed in the light of present knowledge , have a negligible probability of producing severe somatic or genetic damage . Genetic damage could result in mutations , whereas somatic effects could be , for example , skin damage , temporary or permanent sterility following irradiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cataract of eye lenses , bone cancer , anaemia and leukaemia , as well as an increased incidence of malignancies , a shortening of the life span , and premature ageing . In specifying the maximum permissible doses , the possible effects on four critical parts of the body are recognised . These are the bloodforming organs , the gonads , the lenses of the eyes , and the skin . For the first three , the occupational exposure is limited to a maximum of 3 rem in any period of 13 consecutive weeks , with the proviso that the accumulated dose must not exceed 5 ( Y ? 18 ) rem where Y is the age in years of the person exposed . Thus , after the age of 18 a maximum of 5 rem per year is permissible . These maximum doses also apply for uniform irradiation of the whole body . A greater dose is , however , permitted for some less critical parts of the body , such as the hands , forearms , feet , and ankles . For these the maximum permissible dose can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks but with the total not exceeding 75 rem in the year . The maximum permissible dose for skin is 15 rem in any period of 13 weeks , with an annual dose limitation of 30 rem . // The question of what is a permitted dose is more complicated in the case of radioactive sources that are ingested into the body by breathing or in food and drink . The sources may then come into intimate contact with critical organs , so that , for example , alpha and beta particle emitters will now be important , whereas as external sources they were of less importance owing to their low penetration . Further complications may arise as some organs have an affinity for a particular element so that , for example , the radioactive isotope strontium-90 becomes concentrated in the bones . How long an isotope may be retained by the body will depend on the particular isotope and organs concerned and is measured by the biological half-life . This is the time taken by the body to eject half of the number of originally ingested radioactive atoms . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the bone-seeking ones may be regarded as remaining permanently . Doses above those laid down as being permitted , as already indicated , may lead to serious biological damage . A dose of 50 rem would probably produce slight transient blood changes but is unlikely to have any serious lasting effects . A dose of 100 rem , however , will produce fatigue and possibly vomiting , with marked changes in the blood and a shortening of life expectancy . With a dose of 400 rem , however , some deaths can be expected in possibly two weeks , with eventual short-time fatality in about 50% of exposed individuals . Adequate shielding from damaging radiation is obviously vital . The type of shielding will , of course , depend on the type of radiation . Owing to their low penetrating powers , alpha and beta particles are readily stopped , for example , by cardboard or a thin sheet of Perspex . More penetrating radiation requires a thicker shield of high density . Thus several millimetres of lead is often sufficient to absorb X-rays whereas perhaps 2 m of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually used for stopping high-energy neutrons. 5.2 Radiation Monitoring and Detection When making measurements on radiation , it can generally be assumed that the type of radiation is known . Similarly , the energy distribution of the radiation is not usually required , leaving only the intensity of radiation to be measured . The three types of detector which are of greatest practical importance are the gas filled detector , the scintillation counter , and the semiconductor counter . They are all based on the // property of the radiation of being able to produce some form of ionisation . The gas filled detector generally consists of a metal cylinder in which there is an axial wire acting as an anode , as in Figure 5.1 . The cylinder is filled with gas and , on exposing the detector to radiation , there will be some ionisation of the filler gas and electrons and positive ions will be produced . Under the applied electric field , the electrons will move towards the central wire anode and the positive ions towards the cylindrical cathode . The charge collected at the anode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nature and pressure of the filler gas . For low potentials the charged particles will move slowly and thus many will have time to recombine before reaching the anode or cathode . If now the applied voltage is increased , a time will come when the ions move sufficiently fast that the probability of recombination becomes negligible . Then every ion created by the radiation will be received by the anode or cathode and the collected charge will become constant for a particular radiation . The detector is then said to be working in the ionisation-chamber region , as shown in Figure 5.2 . In this region the collected charge remains constant for small variations in voltage and the charge is a direct measure of the ability of the radiation to form ion pairs . If the applied voltage is increased still further , the ions acquire sufficient energy to produce secondary ionisation so that large charges can be collected for a comparatively small initial ionisation . The total charge collected , however , will still be a definite function at a particular voltage of the initial ionisation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio of the charge collected to the initial charge // released is termed the gas amplification factor . This can have values up to about 10000 . Continuing to increase the applied voltage leads to a region of limited proportionality , followed by the Geiger region . Now the secondary emission becomes an avalanche and affects the whole of the anode wire at once . The total charge collected now becomes independent of the applied voltage and of the initial amount of ionisation . Any further increase of the applied voltage beyond the Geiger plateau region leads to a continuous discharge and is of no practical interest . In practice , radiation counters are based on the three regions indicated in Figure 5.2 . Ionisation chambers may be used to count separate events or the various pulses can be integrated and the chamber used as a rate-meter . Such instruments are of interest in health physics for dose rate measurement . Using argon as the filler gas , applied voltages of about 200 V and saturation currents of about 10-10A are common but will depend on the nature of the filler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation being detected . The current from an ionisation chamber , therefore , requires considerable electronic amplification , whereas with a proportional counter much of the amplification is internal . A proportional counter does , however , require a highly stabilised power supply // owing to its amplification depending critically on the applied voltage . The gas most commonly used is a mixture of argon and methane but it is most important that the mixture remains constant and free from impurities , otherwise the gas amplification factor will vary . The required applied voltage varies considerably with the geometry of the electrodes and the nature and pressure of the filler gas and may vary from perhaps a few hundred volts up to two thousand volts . A proportional counter has a maximum counting rate of about 106 counts per second . A modification of the proportional counter is the gas flow type counter . This is especially suitable for use with very weak sources , such as the counting of the weak beta emissions from a carbon-14 source . The flow counter is made demountable so that the source may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation is of sufficiently low energy and would otherwise be unable to penetrate the counter walls . Gas is then passed continuously through the counter to maintain the correct atmosphere . By suitable electronic gating ' , a proportional counter is also able to discriminate between different radiation energies and thus different types of radiation , as in Figure 5.2 . The Geiger counter makes use of an avalanche effect in the secondary emission which makes possible gas amplification factors up to perhaps 108 . With this amount of internal amplification , capable of producing output pulses of perhaps several volts , external electronic amplification may be unnecessary . In Figure 5.3 it is seen that the working voltage should be adjusted to give operation over the central region of the // plateau . Then small variations in the voltage have negligible effect on the counting rate . Ideally , of course , the counting rate should remain constant with voltage over the plateau region but , in practice , the plateau slopes slightly . It is , therefore , usual to quote the working voltage , the width of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter . The sudden avalanche effect owing to the arrival of an ionising radiation may lead to the initiation of smaller spurious discharges . These may be quenched by a suitable electronic circuit but it is more usual to add a small amount of substance with a polyatomic organic molecule , such as ethyl alcohol , as the quenching agent to the argon filler gas . After a pulse the counter requires a short time , termed the dead time , to recover before it is ready to record another pulse . This is due to a positive space charge being left as a sheath around the wire anode , which requires time to disperse after a pulse . During the dead time any arriving ionising radiation will not be recorded . Even after the end of the dead time , the Geiger counter does not recover its full sensitivity for a short time , termed the recovery time . These inoperative periods limit the counting rate to a maximum of about 104 counts per second . The second of the main types of counter is the scintillation counter . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has the property of converting the energy expended by the radiation into light so that the phosphor scintillates . The phosphor is also transparent to the light it emits so that a thick piece of phosphor can be used to ensure adequate absorption of the radiation and yet still transmit all the light produced . A thin film of silicone oil is used to ensure optical contact between the back of the phosphor and the front of a photomultiplier tube so that all the light produced in the phosphor can pass into the photomultiplier . When this light falls onto the photocathode of the photomultiplier tube , electrons are ejected . These electrons are accelerated towards the first electrode of the photomultiplier tube , causing it to eject secondary electrons which are in turn accelerated towards the second electrode of the series , causing it to eject more secondary electrons in its turn . This process repeats itself , producing more secondary electrons at each electrode so that with , say , 12 electrodes with a total of about 2500 V across them a gain of perhaps 106 can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates can be achieved , as high as perhaps 109 counts per second but the rate will depend on the type of phosphor used . The third main type of counter is the semiconductor counter . This is // basically a p-n junction with a voltage across it . Radiation absorbed by the junction region produces hole ? electron pairs which allow a pulse of current to pass , which may be detected in the usual way . These counters have the advantage of being small and rugged and are particularly useful for high-resolution measurements of alpha particles and protons . As well as using counters to check the radiation levels from time to time or when some special hazard is suspected , it is now general practice for all workers who may possibly come into contact with nuclear or X-radiation to carry a film badge to record any chance exposure . This film badge is normally monitored and renewed every two weeks . RADIOACTIVITY 5.3 The Atomic Nucleus An atom consists of a nucleus , made up essentially from two types of particles , neutrons and protons , surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed shells and are subject to various quantum constraints . Each proton carries a positive unit of charge , +e , whilst the neutron carries no charge . For electrical neutrality of an atom , the number of extranuclear orbiting electrons , each of charge ? e , must be equal to the number of protons . This number , Z , is the atomic number of the atom ; it determines the chemical properties of the atom and the position of that atom as an element in the Periodic Table . If the atom is ionised so that , for example , it loses an electron and becomes a positive ion , it still retains its same chemical identity . Its atomic number is unchanged , as determined by the number of protons . The mass of an atom is almost entirely due to the mass of the protons and neutrons , which individually have almost equal masses . The unit of mass , the unified atomic mass unit , u , is defined as a mass equal to of the mass of a carbon atom of atomic mass number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutrons . Since carbon has an atomic number of 6 , its nucleus consists of 6 protons , equal to the stable number of extranuclear electrons , and , since the total number of protons and neutrons must be 12 , of 6 neutrons . Then 1 u = 1.6575 // x 10 27 kg . The mass of a proton is 1.007825 u , of a neutron 1.008665 u , and of an electron 0.0005486 u . The atomic mass number , in which the nuclear mass is given in terms of units of the proton mass , which is assumed to have approximately the same mass as a neutron , is thus an integral value and approximates to the nuclear mass in unified atomic mass units . To denote the mass the chemical symbol can be written , for example , as 1 Na , where the 11 indicates the atomic number , the position in the Periodic Table and therefore the number of protons in the nucleus , and the 23 denotes the atomic mass number . There are thus 12 neutrons ( i.e. 23 ? 11 = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the element in this example is already named as sodium ( Na ) , the atomic number is superfluous and this particular nuclide could be designated as 23Na . Nuclides are atoms with the same atomic number and also having the same number of neutrons in their nuclei as each other . Most atoms do not have a specific number of neutrons . For example , hydrogen , atomic number 1 , has one proton but can have zero , one , or two neutrons . The resulting atoms are termed isotopes of hydrogen . Thus a one-proton nucleus forms hydrogen , 1H ; one proton with one neutron is deuterium , 1 H ; and one proton with two neutrons is tritium , 1 H. Nevertheless all three isotopes behave chemically as hydrogen . Tritium is an artificially produced isotope but deuterium occurs naturally . The abundance of deuterium is 0-016% ? that is , in a sample of naturally occurring hydrogen , 0-016% by weight is in the form of deuterium atoms . The atomic weight is then the weighted mean of the masses of the naturally occurring atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number is thus the nearest integer value to the atomic weight . The mass of one isotope does not differ from another by exactly an integral multiple of the neutron mass . Thus , for example , the mass of a deuterium atom is 2.014102 u whereas the mass of a hydrogen atom plus a neutron is 2.016490 u . The difference is termed the mass defect and is due to energy being released when a proton and a neutron are brought together to form a deuterium nucleus . Conversely , this same amount of energy must be supplied to split a deuterium nucleus . This energy , termed the binding energy , is given by Einstein 's equation E = Amc2 ( 5.2 ) where , , m is the mass defect and c the velocity of light . The energies involved , as are those of other nuclear reactions , are generally measured in electron volts , eV . This is the energy acquired by an electron // accelerated through a potential difference of 1 V. That is , 1 eV 1.6021 x 0-19 and 1 u=931.48MeV= 1.49 x @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a given number of protons ( a given element ) , there is a variable number of neutrons . In most cases a naturally occurring isotope has a quite stable arrangement but in some cases it is necessary for the nucleus to emit energy either as a particle or as electromagnetic radiation in order to attain a stable condition . An isotope that emits energy in this way is said to be radioactive . There are in fact about 50 naturally occurring radioisotopes and about another 850 that are artificially produced . Although there are a number of possible types of emission from a nucleus , the emission of an alpha or a beta particle or a gamma ray constitute the most important mechanisms . An alpha particle is the nucleus of a helium atom ( atomic number 2 ) and as such consists of 2 protons and 2 neutrons . It can thus be regarded as a doubly ionised helium atom , that is , a helium atom stripped of its two extranuclear electrons . Since an alpha particle has a charge of +2e and a mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particle will become an isotope of a new element two positions down in the Periodic Table . A typical transition would be That is , an atom of polonium ( Po ) , with an atomic number of 84 and mass number of 210 , spontaneously emits an alpha particle ( a ) by losing 4 mass units and 2 units of positive charge from its nucleus . It thus becomes a new element with a mass number of 206 and with a nuclear charge of 82 units . This is thus an element with 82 protons and is consequently element number 82 in the Periodic Table , which is lead ( Pb ) . The alpha particle could also be written as l He . As mentioned in the previous Section , there will also be a small discrepancy between the masses on either side of the equation which will manifest itself as energy according to equation 5.2 The greater the nuclear mass , the greater is the likelihood of an alpha particle decay , with elements above atomic number 82 being the main emitters . An alpha particle produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other atoms . // For example , the range of alpha particles in air is only a few centimetres . It is also readily deflected by an electric or magnetic field . If now there are too many neutrons to protons in the nucleus for stability , then a beta particle will be emitted . In this process a neutron decays into a proton and an electron , with the electron being ejected from the nucleus . This ejected electron is termed a beta particle . Negligible change is made in the mass of the nucleus so that the mass number may be regarded as being unchanged , but the nucleus is made one unit more positive by the loss of this beta particle with its one unit of negative charge . The newly created element is thus one position higher in the Periodic Table but with an unchanged mass . A typical reaction would be where the symbol 13 indicates a beta particle with its one unit of negative charge , as distinct from a 0+ particle which has one unit of positive charge and is a positron . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many protons to neutrons for stability . In this case a proton may eject a positron and so decay to a neutron . A typical reaction would then be Again there is no change in mass number but this time the nucleus has lost a proton and the newly created element is thus one position down in the Periodic Table . This type of reaction is about five times less common than a beta decay process . The positron also has a very short life , of the order of 10 10 s , as it is annihilated on meeting an electron . This annihilation process results in the positron and electron masses each being converted into an energy of 0 ? 51 MeV according to equation 5.2 , with the energy manifesting itself in two gamma rays . Beta particles are ejected with very high velocities , which may approach that of light , 3 x 108 m s- . Being of very low mass , beta particles are very easily scattered which limits their penetration to a fraction of a millimetre of aluminium for example , depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetic fields . Gamma ray emission from a nucleus occurs when a nucleus in an excited state changes into a more stable state . In changing into the // lower-energy state , excess energy is emitted in the form of an electromagnetic radiation of frequency v , given by where E2 ? E1 is the change in energy in the nucleus and h is Planck 's constant , equal to 6.626 x 10 3 J s . The energy of the gamma ray is thus hv ; its wavelength is less than about 10-10 m . Both alpha and beta particle emissions are often accompanied by gamma ray emission . Alpha and beta particles , having opposite charges , are deflected in opposite directions by an electric or magnetic field , whereas gamma rays , being an electromagnetic radiation , are unaffected by such fields . Gamma rays are also far more penetrating than alpha or beta particles . A number of other emission processes occur , as for example the emission of neutrons and the various types of mesons . Apart from neutrons , however , which are of importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little practical importance . By bombarding stable isotopes with , for example , alpha particles , new radioisotopes may be created . A typical reaction would be in which an alpha particle ( 2 He ) is used to bombard a nitrogen nucleus to produce a radioisotope of oxygen , together with a proton ( 1H ) . The bombarding alpha particle must have sufficient kinetic energy to penetrate the electron cloud surrounding the nitrogen nucleus . An important factor that concerns the practical use of radioactivity is the time over which the emissions take place . A particular radioisotope will decay spontaneously with the nucleus taking up a new state and emitting a radiation in what may be regarded as an instantaneous process . However , the instant at which a particular nucleus will decide to decay is governed by random processes so that the number of nuclei that decay in a particular time interval is a function of the number of undecayed nuclei still present . The probability that a particular radioactive nucleus will decay in a time interval dt is Xdt where X is the radioactive decay constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time and will be the same for all nuclei of that particular radioisotope . If there is a total of N atoms of the radioisotope present at a time t , the number that will decay in // the time interval between t and t + dt will thus be X N dt . The decrease in the number N of nuclei available for decay is then where the negative sign indicates that the number of available nuclei N decreases with increasing time . Equation 5.8 can be integrated to find the number of undecayed nuclei Nt remaining after a time t , starting from the initial condition of No nuclei existing at a time t = 0 . That is , Nt = Noe At ( 5.11 ) It is also seen that the total number of disintegrations N ' taking place in this time t is given by Equation 5.11 shows that the number of undecayed nuclei falls off exponentially with time at a rate determined by the decay constant . In particular , the time taken for the number of undecayed nuclei Nt to fall to No/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is termed the halflife , T. This is simply determined from equation 5.10 , since A different approach to the rate-of-decay problem is to remember that after a period equal to the half-life has elapsed the number of radioactive atoms of the original type will have been reduced by a factor of a half . After a period t , the number of elapsed half-lives will be t/T , where T is the time for one half-life , so that the number of radioactive atoms originally present will have been reduced by a factor ( 2 ) t/T That is , the number remaining after a time t will be // The half-life of a radioisotope is a characteristic of that particular radioisotope and can not be changed by any known physical or chemical processes . Depending on the particular radioisotope , it can have values that vary over extreme ranges . For example , the artificially produced isotope beryllium-6 has a half-life of 4 x 10-21 seconds , whereas at the other end of the scale potassium-40 has a half-life of about 1.3 x 109 years . This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large number of atoms of the particular radioactive isotope of potassium with a mass number of 40 to decay by some form of radioactive emission process . Since this is an exponential decay process , it obviously does not mean that all the atoms will decay in twice this period . In any practical use of radioactive isotopes , a radioisotope must be chosen with a suitable half-life to allow sufficient counts to be accumulated to compensate for the random nature of the process and obtain an accurate result . For medical uses , however , where it may be required to ingest the radioisotope into the body , it is desirable for the half-life to be sufficiently long for the purpose of the experiment but also short enough that any biological damage produced is negligible . The quantity XN is termed the activity of the particular radioactive sample , whereas the specific activity is the activity of unit mass of that sample . The specific activity of 1 kg is then given by specific activity = A disintegrations s-1 kg-1 ( 5.15 ) where A is the atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x 1026 kg-mole 1 . The unit of activity is the curie , Ci , which is defined as that quantity of radioactive nuclide in which the number of disintegrations occurring in one second is 3.700 x 1010 . This is in fact the activity of 1 g of radium-226 . Therefore the specific activity can be expressed as : where A is the atomic mass number , T the half-life , and X the decay constant of the particular sample of radioisotope. // 5.5 Uses of Radioactive Sources The majority of uses of radioisotopes arise from the penetrating properties of their emissions , although it should be remembered that , the greater the penetrating effect of the radiation , the greater is the difficulty in containing the radiation and shielding the operator from biological hazard . Alpha particles , beta particles , and gamma rays have progressively greater penetrating properties . The source should also have a sufficient activity to ease the problems of counting . A generally satisfactory rate of counting is about 4 disintegrations per second and , since 1 Ci corresponds to 3.7 x 1010 disintegrations per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most suitable . This fact in conjunction with equation 5.17 allows a suitable quantity of the radioisotope to be chosen . Of the many practical uses of radioactivity , only a few applications can be given here but these should be indicative of other possible applications . Figure 5.4 shows schematically an arrangement for measuring the flow rate of a liquid through a pipe . A small quantity of a radioisotope , such as cobalt-60 , is injected into the stream . As it passes the two radiation detectors in turn , a pulse is recorded on a chart // recorder by each event . Knowing the distance d apart of the detectors and the time t between the pulses as determined from the chart recorder trace , the velocity of the flowing liquid and hence the volume flow rate may be calculated . The accuracy of this method is dependent on a rapid injection of the radioisotope for only a short period . The method works best with a turbulently flowing liquid as this ensures adequate mixing , whereas with streamline flow the radioactive tracer becomes too drawn out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed by friction and wear may be counted and hence the rate of wear determined by a test carried out over a short period . A common problem is the wear of a steel component . This may be dealt with by making the steel component radioactive by bombarding it with neutrons , possibly for several weeks , in a reactor . Iron-58 , which has an abundance of 033% in natural iron , is converted to iron-59 , which is radioactive and emits gamma rays ; iron-59 has a half-life of 45 days . The wear rate of this radioactive component can then be determined under its normal operating conditions , whether it be a piston ring in an engine or a lathe cutting tool , for various periods by monitoring the activity of the lubricant . One disadvantage with this technique is that the whole component is radioactive whereas only the surface is of interest . The radioactive source is thus larger than necessary and as such may raise problems of adequate shielding . An alternative method is to electroplate the component with a radioactive metal . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a piston ring with chromium-51 , which again emits gamma rays . Thickness gauging is a very important use of radioactivity . This is a very simple method and only involves a radioactive source and a detector . Any material passed between these will reduce the count rate recorded by the detector and the system may then be calibrated for thickness of the sample against the count rate . Obviously a source with a long half-life is required if the calibration is to remain reasonably constant . Suitable sources are beta emitters for relatively thin or lowdensity materials such as paper , cardboard , or thin metal sheets and gamma ray sources for thicker samples . The method has the advantage that no contact is needed with the sample and it is thus especially suitable for thickness gauging of , for example , sheet metal whilst still being rolled . The method also lends itself to incorporation in feed-back control systems so that , for example , the separation of the rollers can be adjusted automatically to maintain the correct thickness of rolled // sheet . A variation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source and detector are on the same side of the sample . The geometry is such that no radiation may pass directly from the source to the detector so that any radiation detected must have been scattered back from the sample . This method is sensitive to variations in surface coatings and is applicable , for example , to the measurement of paint thickness or printing ink on rollers . Many different sources are suitable for thickness gauging but the final choice is determined by the actual thickness and density of the sample and the sensitivity required . For example , a strontium-90 gamma source is suitable for steel plate up to about 0.5 mm thick . Since it is really the mass of the sample between the source and detector which is of importance , a useful measure of thickness ' that has been commonly used is a unit of one milligramme per square centimetre ( mg cm 2 , where 1 mg cm 2 = 10-2 kg m 2 ) . This is the mass of sample in unit cross-section of the radioactive beam ' . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5a years , is useful for thickness measurements over the range 20 ? 2000 kg m 2 , whilst a strontium-90 beta source with a half-life of 25 years is useful up to a thickness of 6 kg m 2 . The great penetrating properties of gamma rays may also be utilised for radiography . A gamma ray source is placed to one side of the object to be radiographed and a photographic film on the other side . The less dense parts of the object allow greater transmission of the gamma rays with a darkening of the corresponding area of the photographic film . A commonly used source for gamma radiography is cobalt-60 , which is suitable for steel specimens up to about 025 m thick . The technique has the advantage that the equipment costs are low and the equipment itself is moderately easy to transport . It is therefore very useful for operation in remote locations or confined spaces . It does , however , have one disadvantage compared with using X-rays in that a gamma source can not be switched off and consequently be made safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is itself radioactive so that , if it is laid on a photographic film , it will produce a radiogram of itself . For example , the location of strontium-90 taken up by bones can be easily studied by autoradiography . To obtain good resolution with radiographic techniques , the film which should be of fine grain must be in close contact with the object . Also , the lower the energy compatible with reasonable exposure time , the better is the resolution . The techniques so far described make use of the penetrating effects // of the radiation but there are other techniques that make use of its ionising properties . Such radiation can be used for killing bacteria and thus used for sterilising food or surgical dressings . However , fairly large doses are required , up to about 106 rad , which may produce objectionable flavour changes with some foods . By ionising the atmosphere in the region of static electricity buildup , the static may be leaked away . This is especially useful in the weaving and printing industries where cloth and paper moving at high speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged . This charge attracts dust which can mar the print and , in particular , can lead to difficult handling of paper products . Alpha and beta particles are particularly suitable for eliminating static electricity as the radiation can be easily shielded . Other uses include polymerisation in the chemical industry . If a polymer is irradiated , this can lead to a dissociation of a covalent bond and thus induce a chemical reaction . For example , large doses can produce crosslinking , or vulcanisation , of rubber . Finally must be mentioned the use of carbon-14 for dating over the approximate range 1000 ? 20000 years . The upper atmosphere of the earth is under continuous bombardment by cosmic rays which leads to a copious supply of neutrons being released by nuclear interactions . These neutrons then interact in turn with the components of the atmosphere . In particular they can lead to the production of carbon-14 from nitrogen-14 by the reaction where on signifies a neutron and 1H a proton . The radioisotope of carbon then decays with a half-life of 5568 ? 30 years by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particle . Most of this carbon-14 is produced in the upper atmosphere where it is incorporated into atmospheric carbon dioxide . This in turn will be taken up by growing plants and animals . It must be assumed that the intensity of cosmic rays , and with it the production of carbon-14 , has remained constant in the past and that an equilibrium was soon reached in which the production of carbon-14 was balanced by its natural rate of decay . The dating works on the principle that when a plant or animal died it
