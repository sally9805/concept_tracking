txt Physically , it 's the same marble-and-sandstone House of Representatives as last year ( or since 1807 , for that matter ) . But in its actions , the House this year is behaving most unusually . It led the fight to cut off foreign aid to Greece and Pakistan . It welcomed television cameras into hearing rooms . It even edged within just two votes of retiring the military draft . The reawakening of the hibernating House be traced , as much as anything , to a chain of events that culminated one year ago when President Nixon signed into law an internal overhaul of Congress , - One reformer timidly suggested it might lead the House " a few tiny steps forward . " The pace , one year later , has been closer to a dead run . The greatest sweeper of cobwebs , perhaps , has been the most visible reform : putting more votes of individual congressmen " on the record . " Names unrecorded For 182 years , the House conducted much of its legislative craftsmanship anonymously . In the . working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , votes were taken without recording names . All that changed one year ago . Now whenever 20 colleagues request it , congressmen vote by scribbling their names on green " yea " or red " nay " cards and dropping them into two ballot boxes . The results are dramatic : ? More congressmen show up to vote . In a six-month period studied recently by Congressional Quarterly , the turnout on major issues doubled  --  from an average of 190 members in 1970 to an average of 383 in 1971 ( of a total membership of 435 ) . ? Issues get debated more thoroughly . Out from under the shelter of anonymity , congressmen show more personal interest in issues previously left largely to the judgment of specialized committees . // Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner . *Reforms foster new image of House // ? Voters can follow their representative 's performance more closely . Formerly , cons representative voted on only the final version of a bill . Now they often can also discover how he voted on key amendments  --  frequently more revealing than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been used on such major issues as the now-defunct SST , a two-year extension of the draft , Indo-China war withdrawal , authority for the wage and-price freeze , welfare reform , and farm subsidies . The reform is credited ( or blamed ) for narrowing the margin on many issues . The year-old reforms also are opening up a less-publicized side of Congress ? its committees , which write most legislation . Committees have thrown open the doors on more of their sessions ( as encouraged by the new law ) , admitting the public , press , and teleyision crews previously barred . The powerful House Appropriations Committee ( purser for all federal programs ) this year held the first open meetings in its history , including televised hearings . " This committee has been in existence for 105 years , " quipped its chairman , George H. Mahon ( D ) of Texas , " and we thought a little experimentation would not be out of order . " Committees ' roll-call votes now are regularly announced , as required by the new law . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrequired ? step of adopting detailed written rules . More leaders The winds of reform also are spreading the mantle of leadership across more shoulders . One congressman in four ( 113 of 435 ) now chairs a House subcommittee . This redistribution of . power springs not from the 1970 law , but a simultaneous decision by House Democrats barring members from heading more than one subcommittee . Four of the ablest Democratic backbenches in the House ( Donald M. Fraser of Minnesota , Benjamin S. Rosenthal of New York , John C. Culver of Iowa , and Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana ) took over subcommitteer on the Foreign Affairs Committee , and the long-dormant panel suddenly came alive . One result : its stunning decision ( so far unsuccessful ) to suspend controversial aid to Greece and Pakistan . Yet the reform broom has n't swept clean . The year-old overhaul so far has failed to break the domiiTion of Congress 's own-entrenched coalition leadership , and the White House . The House 's conservative coalition of Southern Democrats and Republicans has won 93 percent of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon has lost only three times , Congressional Quarterly calculates . Chairmanships in South Southerners still chair nearly half of all House subcommittees ( 49 of 113 ) , far more than-any other regional bloc . A few committee chairmen openly defy the new rules ? snubbing next-in-line col- leagues when choosing subcommittee chairmen , abolishing subcommittees , or realigning subcommittee jurisdictions . Neither has reform altogether lifted the veil of secrecy . Much committee work continues behind closed doors . Even the committee which wrote the Freedom of Information Act ( House Committee on Government Operations ) shuts its organizational meeting to the public and press . Congress has voluntarily waived a few of the 1970 reforms , including more money for minority-party committee staffs . The law itself ignores other evils , such as the -fragmentedcommittee system . Some of the reforms may be jeopardrieffby their own success . The recorded-teller vote is one . Chairman Jack Brooks ( D ) of Texas of the new Congressional Organization Committee calls its merit " debatable . " After the vote defeating the SST , a high-ranking Republican was more emphatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy thing . "
