India 's Chambal Valley south of New Delhi has for nearly 1,000 years been a homeland to the feared dacoits - professional bandits for whom murder and robbery are a tradition as well as a way of life . Conventional police methods have persistently failed to control the dacoits , but twelve years ago , a saintly follower of Mahatma Gandhi - Acharya Vinoba Bhave-gently persuaded some of the bandits to give themselves up . Last week another Gandhi disciple named Jayaprakash Narayan arranged for a much larger group of dacoits to surrender voluntarily . TIME Correspondent William Stewart was the only American newsman to witness the scene and talk with the bandits . His report : <P> Travelers venture along the winding dirt roads of the Chambal Valley at their peril . The sharp ravines provide good hiding places for fugitives from the law . In 1971 alone , India 's notorious dacoits committed 285 murders , 352 kidnapings and 213 robberies , all within an area smaller than the state of Maryland . Arable land in the valley is obviously precious , and it is not difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley 's temperamental Rajputs resorted to sudden murder over real or imagined wrongs . <P> Police operations have sometimes been massive-at one point more than 2,000 policemen were searching for a bandit named Man Singh-but never very successful . The campaigns were frustrated as much by the local people , who regard the bandits as baghis ( rebels ) rather than thieves , as by the cunning of the dacoit gangs . The bandits , many of whom like to take from the rich and give to the poor in Robin Hood tradition , carefully cultivate local good will , rewarding villagers with presents at weddings . But they are also ruthless in eliminating suspected informers . <P> At a government guesthouse in the village of Jaura , deep in dacoit country , I talked with Jayaprakash Narayan , 69 , director of the Gandhi Institute of Studies and once a prominent Socialist politician . He is a man of simple and transparent goodness . Last October , Narayan told me , he had been visited by a man claiming to be a lesser dacoit . The visitor pleaded with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' surrender . <P> Police pressure was increasing and could only mean more bloodshed . Narayan remained unmoved until the bandit admitted that he was really Madho Singh , 35 , one of India 's most wanted men , with a price of $21,000 on his head . Singh said that the dacoits were ready to surrender if the government would promise not to hang any of the men , to prosecute within six months , and to rehabilitate their families . Impressed , Narayan agreed to undertake the task . <P> Along a dirt road outside Jaura is the Gandhian ashrama known as the Change of Heart Mission . Under a makeshift but colorful tent , we lunched on vegetables and rice served on plates of dried banyan leaves . There I met a former bandit whom Vinoba Bhave had persuaded to surrender . " Did you ever kill anyone ? " I asked . " Naturally . I killed policemen , " he answered . " How many ? " " If I asked you how many pieces of bread you 've eaten in the past two months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
