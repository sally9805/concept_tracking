 | James Dickey " Poet of Survival and Hope " @# IN THE EVE of Jimmy Carter 's Inauguration , Washington 's Kennedy Center was the scene of a nationally televised gala . Midway through , a hulking , rawboned man mounted the stage . His powerful shoulders were stooped , as though he had spent too much time behind a plow . And when he blinked in the glare of the TV lights , he seemed somehow uncomfortable ? a farmer , perhaps , among city slickers . In a soft Southern drawl , he read " The Strength of Fields , " a poem he had been asked to write for the Inauguration . Stunning in its simplicity , it told of a man ? a President  | perhaps ? whose purpose was rooted 111 rural America . It concluded : That is where it has to start , With the simplest things . More kindness will do nothing less Than save every sleeping one And night-walking one Of us . My life belongs to the world . I will do what I can . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the Kennedy Center erupted in thunderous applause . Not since Robert Frost and Carl Sandburg has America taken a poet for its own . And , like Ernest Hemingway and Jack London , James Dickey is fast becoming a legend in his own time , a man whose zest for the adventure of life equals his talents for communicating it to others . In but the space of a decade Dickey published eight volumes of his poetry , and his 1965 classic volume , Buckdancer 's Choice , won the National Book Award . Nevertheless , the versatile Dickey was largely unknown to the general public until the 1970 publication of his novel Deliverance ? a simple but terror-filled saga of a four-man voyage down a Georgia wilderness river . The book was widely received as a classic in American literature , but it was the 1972 film , starring Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds , that popularized James Dickey . Not only did Dickey write the novel , but he also wrote the screenplay . In addition , he suggested the music for the movie , and acted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised in suburban Atlanta , Dickey 's passion as a young man was football . And he was a flashy enough tailback ? at six-footthree and 210 pounds ? to play a year of football at Clemson University . But his college career was cut short by World War II . As a member of the 418th Night Fighter Squadron , Dickey flew more than too combat missions . He learned to live with instant , often horrible death high in the starlit skies over the Pacific . Later , in " The Firebombing , " he would recall the sensations : Snap , a bulb is tricked on in the cockpit And some technical-minded stranger with my hands Is sitting in a glass treasure-hole of blue light , Having potential fire under the undeodorized arms Of his wings , on thin bomb-shackles , The " tear-drop-shaped " Soo-gallon drop-tanks Filled with napalm and gasoline . It was this experience of accepting death ? and delivering it ? that caused Dickey first to think about life , his life , his own meaning as a man , about evil , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightfall and that evening 's mission , he began to read what others=Keats , T S. Eliot , Frost ? had written of similar thoughts . And he began to write ? never knowing if he would live to complete his work . It was a different young man who  | returned to the United States in 1945 . " Perhaps it was war , " he would say later , " but I have come to look on existence from the standpoint of a survivor . I think you only know the value of life if you know death , or if you 've been close to death . Then you see what a glorious thing it is to be alive . " In the fall of 1946 , Dickey enrolled in Vanderbilt University , where he majored in English , consumed vast volumes of poetry , classics both European and American , and graduated with honors . Then , once again , war intervened . In 1950 , the U.S. Air Force recalled James Dickey for the Korean conflict . He was 27 . When he returned to civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his own words he would be a " poet of survival and hope , " and he would try to " charge America and the world with a vitality of life it already had but needed explaining . " Dickey 's family is wealthy , but he decided to go it alone . In 1951 , Dickey earned the grand sum of $28.50 from the literary magazine Sewanee Review for his first published work , and soon his teaching job at Rice University proved inadequate to support his wife and growing family . Mellowed by poverty and the prospects of literary failure , he accepted a position as a copywriter with a large New York advertising agency . There he laughingly referred to himself as " Jingle Jim , " writing commercials in " miraculous time " so he could return to his poetry . It took Dickey five years to reach the breaking point , which came during an advertising presentation . The president of his firm was performing the usual introductions : " And this is Jim Dickey , " he said . " He writes poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand down on the conference-room table . Advertising is my hobby , " he said . Thus ended Dickey 's career as an ad man . A short time later , with the blessings of his wife , he quit and began writing poetry full time . It was a move that eventually forced him to sell his house and even go on relief . Yet , at age 38 , Dickey felt closer than ever to his goal . He wrote continuously and gave readings to groups as small as five people . On one occasion he was asked to introduce the famous poet e. e. cummings to a poetry reading in New York . Dickey was enthusiastic : " Not only was I going to meet the great cummings , I was going to get paid $15 for doing so ? that was two bags of groceries . " Still , he persisted and within the year received a Guggenheim grant of $5000 . He spent the next year in Italy with his wife and sons , writing furiously . Volumes of his poetry began to appear .

For him , the rivers and forests of his native state throbbed with life , ever changing yet always vital . And this theme echoed 1979 JAMES DICKEY ? " POET OF SURVIVAL AND HOPE "  | constantly in his own work : life , to be alive , to search and to know . Indeed , it was a harrowing whitewater canoe ' trip down Georgia 's treacherous Chattooga River with two friends that would serve as the basis for Deliverance . Dickey also became an accomplished folk guitarist , and on outings he and his companions would sit about the campfire and pick their guitars through the night . Always , their conversations returned to literature , the role of the unforgiving malevolence of nature , the wild outdoors they continually pursued . For Dickey , these years of high energy and danger were formative : As in the war years before , each event and experience was committed to memory and his remarkable creative process . He constantly challenged himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , James Dickey is hard at work on a half dozen new projects ? two screenplays , a TV series , a book of poems ( his newest , The Strength of Fields . and Other Poems , is scheduled for November publication ) , two novels . One novel , provisionally called Alnilam ? after a star in the constellation Orion ? was conceived 12 years ago and has required years of meditation . " I have found that if one plunges immediately into a subject , " says Dickey , " one is almost certain to take the shortest and most disastrous way . " More than ever before , Dickey 's habits have become work- and goaloriented . He rises early , then plans his day : poetry , his novel , essays in progress , film-making ideas , musical scores for guitar . Dickey also finds time for his students at the University . of South Carolina , where he is Carolina Professor and Poet-in-Residence . On the days of his classes , he can be seen ambling across the campus dressed in faded jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pheasantfeather band . Across his back is his ever-present guitar . Dickey 's classes are standing-room-only , his lectures both provocative and entertaining . Perched on a stool , he may pick out a new musical score on his guitar , teaching rhythm . Or he may serenade his students with a haunting Southern folk tune . But whatever the tools , his students learn not only about poetry but about life . " Never cower from life , " he exhorts them . " Live it all out . " On campus and off , Dickey 's presence exudes a rare vitality . Beneath his rough exterior lies a deep kindness , sympathy and understanding for the plight each of us faces through life . Nor is he without a sense of self , of both humor and irony . Indeed , Dickey scoffs at any notions of greatness . He is an ordinary man , he insists .
