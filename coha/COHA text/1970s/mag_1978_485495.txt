While Howard Jarvis , Pied Piper of Prop ' osition 13 , was stealing the year 's headlines with his seductive melody , of popular reaction , the true guardians of the Right , the relatively anonymous corporate managers , were waging what appears increasingly to be a religious war  --  the crusade against government regulation . The call to arms can be heard , as usual , in the business media . The Wall Street Journal , no surprise , never misses a chance to excoriate offending . agency , usually in two or three sermons a week . Time , Newsweek , the New York Post , the Los Angeles Times , The Washington , Post  --  all have recently railed against the multiple sins and wickedness of " excessive " regulation .

Governmentregulation has been blamed for the misfortunes ' of the steel industry , the energy crisis , skyrocketing ' food costs and a chronic housing shortage . The cost of regulation , say its foes , has reached $100 billion a . year-5% of GNP ? and is rising rap- idly . Sadly , they add , these costs must be passed on to the consumer. - Everybody loses . Why this outcry at just this time ? The regulation of business , which is something of an American invention , has a long , and jaded history . Reams of social science literature have shown that over the years business and its regulators have become anything but odd bedfellows . Federal bodies typically have protected regulated , industries from competition , approved rate hikes without a second thought and generally stifled innovation while closing their eyes to consistent abuses of the " public interest .

But regulation has had two diStinct phases in American history . The first originated in the 1870s , during the years of a fervent prairie populism , and continued into the New Deal . The monuments of that progressivism were the Interstate Commerce Commission ( 1887 ) , the Federal Trade Commission ( 1914 ) , the Federal Power Commission ( 1920 ) , the Federal Communications Commission ( 1934 ) , the Civil Aeronautics Board ( 1938 ) and similar bodies at the state level . Most of them were designed not only to monitor " natural monopolies " but , in effect , to insure their hegemony . The jurisdiction of the commissions was generally limited to setting rates and granting routes , channels and the like . It rarely happened that an in-dustry was not given exactly what it wanted ; more often , commission rulings protected the monopolies from price competition and stabilized their expansion in ways that an unregulated market would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation has appeared , one that attempts to address the " social costs " of industrialism . Four are particularly important : the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA , 1970 ) , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA , 1970 ) , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( 1970 ) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( 1965 ) . The fundamental principle guiding these ' agencies is that traditional market mechanisms are inadequate to reverse racial ( and sexual ) discrimination and to prevent abuses of the natural environment , the consumer and the individual worker . That these agencies have for the most part taken their mission seriously is what provokes the businessman 's present lament . The corporations are being held , accountable for their transgressions , and they do n't like it . 732 , proving the quality of life ? There is a pro-business bias as well in the way these costs are measured . It is simple enough to compute the cost of a coal stack scrubber or the annual budget of EPA ; it is quite another matter to put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective prevention . Gus Speth , a member of the President's'Council on Environmental Quality ( CEQ ) , sums it up this way : " Our economics counts up the money we have spent to enfoi:ce environmental statutes ; it is just be -- ginning to take account of the money that we did not spend to repair the consequences of our carelessness . " For every Kepone incident , oil tanker spill , coal mine accident , or Love Canal evacuation that does not occur , there are not only enormous savings to taxpayers but a saving in human terms that is incalculable . But businessmen , prefer not to discuss  --  or recognize ? costs that are n't reflected on a bottom line . A nd even counting the true cost of " disasters " would be inadequate ; a complete analysis should include'the chronic effects of economic growth as well . A few studies have attempted ' to measure this factor , and the results are consistently contrary to prevailing corporate dogma . Tie ? are particularly instructive . The first , conducted by Lester Lave and Eugene Seskin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds that the benefits of achieving 197=1 standards for smokestack pollution far outweigh the expense . Conservatively estimating a 7% reduction in illness and death caused by sulfate and particulate emissions , the authors show that $20 billion would be saved in health expenditures by utilizing pollution abatement equipment costing $10 billion in the 1979-85 period . ( They also point out , however , that reducing auto emissions may cost more than what is saved on medical bills . ) They believe , in fact , that environmental laws are probably less stringent than they should be , purely on the basis of direct costs , again without reference to human suffering or associated economic dislocations ( such as lost productivity or property damage ) . A second study evaluates the much trumpeted relationship between safety/environmental controls and inflation . Businessmen repeatedly cite EPA and OSHA standards as major factors in higher prices , an attitude Carter echoed in his October anti-inflation speech . ' This relationship was analyzed by Chase Econometrics , a group highly respected in corporate circles . Their conclusion : federal controls add , at most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970-83 . A drastic 25% cut in environmental regulation would , therefore , reduce the present rate of inflation by only 1/100th , and that figure does not reflect the economic benefits of such sanctions . , So too with jobs . It is an axiom of the corporate line on regulation that jobs are inevitably lost because capital that is nonproductive when used to comply with fedetal standards would otherwise go into job-creating investments . CEOs Speth debunks that claim , citing statistics to show that , while 20,000 jobs may have been lost because of stepped-up environmental protection , another 600,000 were created in r tion . December 30 , 1978 firms dealing in pollution abatement . That such companies , because they do not manufacture consumer goods , are therefore unworthy of notice in a production-oriented economy , surely calls into question the worth of the entire service sector which now accounts for more than half of the GNP . Indeed , the long-term advantages of vigorously enforced environmental standards may be considerably greater than those studies suggest . Leger Brown , head of the Worldwatch Institute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cropland , grassland , air quality and the like , in an irrevocable process . The world 's resource base is critically reduced and the effects , he notes , are " rising real costs resulting from the diminishing and negativq returns experienced when off-take exceeds the regenerative-capacities of biological systems . Under these circumstances , the real cost of production can ' only rise . " In this lesson of prudent resource management there is an irony that should n't be lost : ecology activists , so often portrayed as wealthy elitists , are actually the most cogent guardians of price stability . Moreover , the economic benefits of increased regulation have not been calculated . The rising incidence of cancer , for example , is a grave concern in the medical community and has been an emotional focal point in the regulatory debate . Laboratory studies , usually involving experiments with animals , are often debunked in the business press as being inadequate to assess human risk . Some corporate spokesmen have gone so far as to accuse the Food and Drug Administration of using " scare tactics " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed scary : 400,000 Americans die of cancer each year ( about 85,000 from smoking-induced cancer ) ; many more hundreds of thousands survive after painful  --  and expensive  --  treatment . Doctors now describe cancer as an epidemic , and agree that 70% to 90% is environmentally caused . The cost in medical expenses alone is in the billions annually . And this is for only one category of the diseases largely caused by lax environmental protection . - - It should be noted , too , that the economic strains brought on by increased regulatory activism have resulted from accumulated neglect . " We have to catch up with 200 years of tragedy in the workplace , " says OSHA head Eula Bingham . " There are things we have known about for more than 200 years , things such as lead poisoning , dangerous fire escapes , dangers from aromatics and metals that we have n't done anything about . But we can catch up . And when we do , the burden on this agency will become much lighter . " But even with the heightened awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult tustem the tide , of , abuse . In 1977 , for instance , industrial illness and injury actually increased ; they now afflict 10% of the nation 's workers annually . Yet OSHA is usually cited as being the most meddlesome , even op-pressive , regulatory agency . Corporate protests against regulation have another interesting dimension  --  their calculations are not only one-sided , they are persistently deceptive , They hide an important , perhaps major , , cost of regulation : the activities of business itself . Michael Pertschuk , chairman of the Federal Trade Commission , discussing the point in a speech in Chicago last October , declared that " The most costly  --  and least justified  --  regulatory burdens flow from economic regulation by business , of business , for business . " He cited several examples , including the attempts by pharmaceutical companies to prevent drug stores from selling lower-priced generic brands , and called such practices " defiance of the law . . . anti-competitive and ! inflationary . " But although Pertschuk 's claim is probably on target , business ' contribution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopolistic behavior . Two forms of this contribution can be discerned : scapegoating and stonew-alling . Scapegoating is especially obvious in the nuclear power industry . Though the beneficiary of some $200 billion in federal subsidies , nuclear power is increasingly regarded as an unjustifiably expensive and wasteful form of energy production ( to say nothing of its hazards ) . Nuclear advocates most often lay the blame for escalating costs on what one utility president called " a nightmare of red tape " ? the licensing , siting and safety requirements which , they contend , extend construction time and tie up capital . In the face of claims by the industry 's critics that the procedures now in effect are inadequate to deal thoroughly with the myriad problems of nuclear power  --  very few projects have met the delays of Seabrook  --  the nuclear industry is confident that relaxed regulatory standards would , as one business writer put it , " reduce the time for completing a power plant to six years and thus help make construction costs lower and more predictable . " But according:to an exhaustive Rand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false and self-serving . The report , published last year and decidely pro-nuke , concludes that long lead times and the wildly escalating costs of nuclear generation must be attributed to poor planning and management : " Charges made by the industrythat licensing procedures and protests by environmentalists had seriously hampered the growth of nuclear power are not supported by the evidence ; ... delays caused by these factors were minor compared to the start-up delays within the industry itself . " It is symptomatic of anti-regulation fever to scapegoat federal agencies for industry failures , even in a sector that has enjoyed the most favorable government treatment . Stonewalling is an even greater business contribution to the costs of regulation . Every new regulation , every requeSt for information , every inspection tour is routinely resisted . Corporations automatically challenge government sanctions in court , and such litigation is time consuming and expensive . The administrative machinery needed for enforcement is often staggering ; the size and competence of each corporation 's legal staff usually rivals that of the entire corresponding federal agency . As one dismayed OSHA official complains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold up the process forever . Each new evasion requires k more detailed regulation , and that means more paperwork , more loopholes . Eventually we have to compromise to get any compliance at all . If they would only show some cooperation , the whole process would be vastly more efficient . " The stonewalling strategy , and the war on regulation generally , is almost certain to impede the effectiveness of the regulatory agencies . Last spring even the Supreme Court got into the act , ruling that OSHA must have warrants to inspect plant conditions . The attacks from the President 's economic advisers are calculated to make enforcement more defensive and hesitant , even as goals and standards " are ' reduced . " We have been guilty of the sin of omission , " Eula Bingham said in a recent interview . " Aye were so concerned with health that maybe we wire , at fault for not presenting more data on cost effectiveness . " That may be a laudable reassessment , but.one wonders if the pendulum swing toward cost/benefit ratios wo n't lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real economic benefits of their activism . Business will eontinue to wage its . holy war against regulation with ample armaments : billions in advertising dollars and a stridently sympathetic business press . The preaching now even includes an attack on the motives of the regulators , . portraying them as a " new class , engaged , " as Irving Kristol says , " in a class struggle with the business community for status an power . " That this " new class " ? may simply be serious about health , safety and equal opportunity does not fit well with the anti-regulation crusade ; the corporate apologists must impugn the regulators ' motives as evil or illiberal , even as they denounce the heresies of " unnecessary " and " excessive " costs . Regulation is an imperfect system , nearly as imperfect as the economic system that spawned and requires it . As the OSHA official observes , " If they did n't create hazardous conditions to begin with , the regulations would n't be necessary at all . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
