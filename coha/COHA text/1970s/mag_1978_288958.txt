A bold American effort to rate the " candidates " <P> One hundred sixteen Roman Catholic Cardinals round the world will get an unusual item in their mail this week : a 300-page book containing " dossiers " on all 116 , who some day will enter a conclave and , from among their ranks , elect the next Pope . The book , The Inner Elite : Dossiers of Papal Candidates ( $12.95 ) , is but the beginning . The publisher , Sheed Andrews &; McMeel , is also putting out a cheeky monthly newsletter , Conclave Confidential , which for $30 a year offers the latest scuttlebutt on papal " candidates " and Vatican politicking . Next to come : computerized game plans on ways the conclave might develop . <P> All this is a bold ( some would say rash ) American-based program to open up the election process , which is wreathed in secrecy . If Popes were Presidents , of course , such publications would be routine . One does not " run " for Pope , however , and a Cardinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Besides , the time of election depends not on the calendar but on the death of the frail incumbent , Pope Paul , 80 . Inevitably , such speculation seems a bit ghoulish . <P> James Andrews , chairman of Sheed , dreamed up the project two years ago and put the dossier book in the capable hands of Author Gary MacEoin , who edited reports from 100 tipsters in many nations . <P> The related newsletter runs material mainly from three anonymous writers in Rome and three in the U.S. Both the book and the newsletter are sponsored by 18 Catholics who make up a Committee for the Responsible Election of the Pope , chaired by Andrews and Philip Scharper , top editor at the Maryknoll Fathers ' Orbis Books . <P> The Sheed dossiers combine straight biographical facts with opinionated , often blunt assessments . And some spice . Pericle Felici , 66 , the " ruthless " front-running candidate on the right , is said to use a telephoto lens to monitor Pope Paul 's movements about his palace . Another Curia Cardinal , Giuseppe Maria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast cars " who currently zips about in a red BMW 3000 . In Guatemala , Mario Casariego has been so closely identified with the regime that his automobile is always accompanied by " a radio patrol and two armed motorcycle guards . " <P> The dossiers have a none-too-subtle tilt to the left , which results in putdowns of most of the U.S. Cardinals . John Carberry of St. Louis is " threatened by a world he does not understand . " Terence Cooke of New York is " untouched by theology or other theoretical influences . " John Krol of Philadelphia and the Vatican 's John Wright are both " princely " and " authoritarian . " The ideological bias flaws judgment in some instances . It is dubious whether Belgium 's Leo Jozef Suenens was the non-Italian " front runner in the early 1970s " or that another liberal , Holland 's Bernard Alfrink , will be " one of the most influential " conclave members .
