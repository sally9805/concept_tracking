To the typical young enlisted man facing trial by court-martial , the jury hardly seems to be composed of his peers . Usually the panel is dominated by officers who are older and more at home in the service than he . When enlisted men are selected , they are often crew-cut senior noncoms with little sympathy for youngsters who challenge military custom . At the Long Binh logistics base in South Viet Nam , however , a civilian lawyer and a veteran Army colonel recently collaborated to produce the most unusual jury in military memory . <P> The case itself was routine . Specialist Four Henry Rollins , 24 , a combat veteran serving his second tour in Viet Nam , was walking with a buddy who wore fatigues but no hat . The absence of the hat meant that Rollins ' companion was , technically , in improper uniform . A command sergeant major hailed the G.I.s by shouting , " Hey , soldier ! " The pair disregarded the call , which came from behind them . When the sergeant major caught up , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with assaulting a superior and failing to obey an order , Rollins faced a sentence of six months at hard labor plus a reduction in rank and pay . <P> Not So Tight . During the pretrial hearing , Joseph Remcho , 27 , a member of the Lawyers ' Military Defense Committee that has been defending G.I.s , asked that the jury be selected at rani dom . Remcho had lost on the same moi tion in a dozen previous cases . This time , however , Colonel Arthur Corley , commander of Long Binh , consented . Explained the career officer : " The mil-j itary justice system is under attack , par- i ticularly by those who consider themselves more liberal than the establishment . . . We decided to give it a try to show that we are not so tight . " <P> Using Social Security numbers , rotation dates and other personnel data as guides , computer programmers at the base worked with more than 100 names officers and enlisted men of assorted ranks-and winnowed out a group of nine . The authorities were really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true random sample . But when the give-and-take of courtroom selection was over , the final panel of five contained not a single officer . Instead there were two junior sergeants , one specialist five and two specialists four . The senior man , and hence the president , was only 23 years old . <P> Quick Verdict . The key point in the one-day trial was the sergeant major 's testimony that he had not even touched Rollins before he himself was struck . This conflicted with the sergeant major 's earlier statement to the military police . Another item that apparently weighed heavily with the jury was whether the shouted " Hey , soldier ! " coming from behind constituted an order to stop . Finally the jury seemed not to take the initial violation of being hatless very seriously . At one recess , the jurors left their own hats behind , and were reminded by a passing officer to retrieve them . <P> The verdict of not guilty was quick in coming . Remcho insisted that " the jury brought into the courtroom the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while not arguing with the outcome , regretted that no officer was on the panel to lend " greater balance and maturity . " Major John McHardy , the military trial judge , had the most decisive comment : " The verdict was supported by the evidence . "
