Choosing TV news anchor men by Nielsen ratings may seem like the next worst thing to letting Agnew do it . But last week ABC in fact picked its man through a survey , and the choice made excellent journalistic sense . The network hired away CBS 's Harry Reasoner to replace Co-Anchor Man Frank Reynolds . <P> Though deeper in correspondents and smarter in production during the last 18 months , the ABC evening news has never been able to command more than about 20% of the three-network audience . All that was missing , ABC News President Elmer Lower concluded , was what he called a " box office value " anchor man . A national survey commissioned from an audience-research firm showed that CBS 's Walter Cronkite was America 's favorite ; No. 2 was not NBC 's David Brinkley or Chet Huntley ( he was still around then ) or even Reynolds ' fellow commentator , Howard K. Smith . It was the CBS back-up man , Reasoner . <P> ABC had never thought it had a chance of getting Harry until his agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 1 fill-in and was , at 47 , seven years younger than Cronkite , Reasoner felt that he might have to wait for years to succeed Walter-and at that the succession was uncertain . Moreover , Reasoner was piqued at being relegated to radio for CBS 's election-night coverage , and upset that CBS was offering to renew his expiring contract for another seven years without a raise above his estimated current annual $150,000 . ABC offered a five-year contract , at something close to $1 million overall . <P> In his new job , which he takes over next month , Reasoner will be based in Manhattan , and Smith will continue in Washington . Judging from Reasoner 's past form , he will be empathic , bemused and , in the nonpejorative sense of the term , Middle American . His style is a mellow mixture of an Iowa boyhood , a Stanford and University of Minnesota education , newspapering in Minneapolis , the World War II Army , a stint with the U.S.I.A. , the demi-sophistication of CBS plus the vicissitudes of fathering seven children . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not kid himself that his tenure at ABC depends on anything but his future ratings . Frank Reynolds , who will become a " special correspondent , " was ABC 's ninth anchor man in eight years .
