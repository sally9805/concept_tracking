Though he is a plumber by trade , AFL-CIO President George Meany becomes a master stagehand when he sets up an appearance by President Nixon before the nation 's labor leaders . Late in 1971 , when union bosses were complaining that wage-price controls were rigged against workers , Meany personally wet-blanketed the President ; he even forbade the union orchestra to play Ruffles and Flourishes when Nixon arrived at the AFL-CIO convention . But a rapprochement began when Meany turned benevolently neutral in last year 's election . Last week , if music had been called for when Nixon addressed a closed-door session of the AFL-CIO executive council in Bal Harbour , Fla. , it would have had to be Let Me Call You Sweetheart . Meany and Nixon paraded arm in arm out of the meeting and past applauding union officials . Said Meany of Nixon 's talk : " I thought he done very well . " <P> So , apparently , had Meany . This week the labor-management advisory committee to the Cost of Living Council , the agency that administers Phase III , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage increases with a much more flexible standard . Instead of hewing to any numerical guideline , Phase III labor contracts would then be allowed to reflect the current rate at which the cost of living is rising , how much productivity has increased and even the profit level of the industry involved . <P> The new standard , which Nixon must have known was coming , obviously risks giving a new spin to the destructive wage-price spiral . United Rubber Workers President Peter Bommarito , who will be negotiating several important contracts later this year , told colleagues in Florida that he plans to shoot for a 10% pay raise in the first year of each new pact . An implied tie between wage increases and the cost of living would almost surely prompt union negotiators to press for extra-high wage boosts , since the Government 's consumer price index has lately taken some big jumps . In January it rose by a distressing .5% almost entirely because retail food prices took their wildest leap on record-an increase of 2.3% in a single month . <P> Even so , Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes , but also to those of COLC Chairman John T. Dunlop . As head of a special Government council organized in 1971 to cool off wage inflation in the construction industry , Dunlop deliberately shunned any " one number " in reviewing pay settlements , arguing that equity varies widely from contract to contract . Dunlop 's success with that philosophy was impressive : average construction wage hikes dropped from a ruinous 18% annually in 1970 to a moderate 5.7% last year . <P> Nixon 's appearance at the AFL-CIO meeting and the new flexibility in wages were only the two freshest roses tossed by the White House lately in labor 's path . Meany was respectfully consulted on both Dunlop 's appointment and that of Peter Brennan , a New York City hardhat leader who became the first union man to head the Labor Department in almost 20 years . The President also took the extraordinary step of inviting Meany to submit his personal nominees for several top-ranking jobs in the Housing and Urban Development , Commerce and Defense departments . Finally , Nixon promised to do what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign competition .
