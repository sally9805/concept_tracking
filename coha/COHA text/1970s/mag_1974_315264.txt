LOCKED ROOMS AND OPEN DOORS : Diaries and Letters of Anne Morrow Lindbergh , 1933-1935 352 pages . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $7.95 . <P> Few writers have combed their own lives for meaning more assiduously than Anne Morrow , the shy , highborn girl who married Charles A. Lindbergh at the height of his fame . Her books range from North to the Orient to Gift from the Sea . At their best they establish her as a womanly writer of considerable skill and restraint and justly give her a stature apart from her role as the Lone Eagle 's wife . " Damn , damn , damn , " she once confided to her diary . " I am sick of being this handmaid to the Lord ! " <P> Now 67 , she has in recent years been recombing that life , issuing volumes of edited diaries and letters that began with her opulent childhood ( Bring Me a Unicorn , 1972 ) as daughter of Morgan Partner Dwight Morrow , and Ambassador to Mexico . The second volume was last year 's bestselling account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hour of Lead ) . This third volume begins when the Lindberghs were still hounded by reporters , and ends when they decided to escape it all and find a new life in England . The result is short on drama , but it rises to savage yet poignant moments . On a rare trip on a New York subway , Anne Lindbergh records : " Horrible horrible-looking people . I wanted to say , ' And which one of you killed my boy ? ' " <P> Scattered Details . She takes trips with Charles , serving as navigator and radio operator , and then , leaving behind her new son Jon , embarks on a five-month flight in a pontooned Lockheed Sirius to explore air routes over the Atlantic . Scattered among the details of such travel are passages of sharp perception . Commenting on a dinner with Harold Nicolson and his wife V. Sackville-West , Anne writes : " What is there about the English ? You seem to be talking openly with perfect naturalness when-snap-the blind goes up ( or down , actually ) ... and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first anniversary of the tragedy . " The punctuation of anniversaries is terrible , like the closing of doors , one after another between you and what you want to hold on to . " <P> Beyond therapy and the usefulness that a diary can have for the emotionally distraught , Locked Rooms and Open Doors shows a born reporter 's desire to get things down exactly . " I must write it all out , at any cost , " Anne admits . " Writing is thinking . It is more than living , for it is being conscious of living . " <P> The book also reveals the author as a person of courage in tragic and trying circumstances . She refers to Lindbergh as " Charles " or as " C. " Still , an attentive reader learns a good deal about one of the enduring marital relationships of the century . There came a moment when , almost four years after the kidnaping , a earful of news photographers forced the limousine taking 3-year-old Jon home from school to the curb , then flashed bulbs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne had taken an apartment in New York . But Lindbergh abruptly decided they must quit America for England . As the family set sail , Anne wrote in the diary : " All my life seems to be trying to ' get settled ' and C. shaking me out of it . But you like it ? Yes . " <P> A.T . Baker
