SERIOUS PEOPLE rarely go to the theater in New York anymore . They might dutifully accompany a child to The Magic Show or an insistent out-of-towner to the latest musical sensation ( even as they weari-ly know , having seen A Chorus Line , that the best they can hope for is technical brilliance in the service of fatuous simplicities ) . The hardier can still be lured out occasionally to see the critics ' current designee as " most promising new playwright " ; but when they come home raging against what has turned out to be yet another bit of stylized trivia , the conviction deepens that our theater is without ambition and ought to be allowed to seek the only level to-which it aspires : a wing of the commercial entertainment industry . Has it ever been anything more ? It can be argued that theater in America has always been tied to mass taste , which ? at least since Shakespeare 's day ? rarely coincides with art . Yet rumor persists of a golden age in this country ' during which plays of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of the Bicentennial celebration , when in stitutional theaters throughout the country felt obliged to revive some " important " American play , cast considerable doubt on the authenticity of any golden age . The assembled offerings proved embarrassingly thin : moralistic melodramas , sentimental comedies , high-toned historical epics of alarming illiteracy . This may be why little eflort was made during the Bicentennial to resurrect the works of Maxwell Anderson , Sidney Kingsley , Sidney Howard , or Robert Sherwood : having been once hailed as towering literary figures , their now-obvious mediocrity became too painful to confront . Perhaps for a comparable reason , Lillian Hellman ? always so astute in matters of career management ? refused permission , except in one case , for the revival of any of her plays . Attention during the Bicentennial focused instead on writers for whom large claims had never been made and whose occasional play could therefore be resuscitated with the justification that it was " a significant period piece " or a " lighthearted entertainment . " Thus we got The Secret Service , by William Gillette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Percy Mac-Kaye , The New York Idea , by Langdon Martin Duberman , historian and playwright , is Distinguished Professor of History at Lehman College , City University of New York . Mitchell , and Craig 's Wife , by George Kelly . All turned out to be from periods of no relevance to our own and of an entertainment value just this side of outright slumber . More surprising was that revivals of some of our certified heavies ? Clifford Odets , Thornton Wilder , S. N. Behr-man , Arthur Miller , Edward Albec came out looking perilously akin to the mainstream tradition , however superior to it in narrative complication or character development . George S. Kaufman , of all people , appeared fresh and sturdy in comparison with the others ? perhaps because Kaufman was always clear-sighted about the dimension of his talent and never indulged that ruinous penchant among American playwrights ( Albee being the foremost example ) for grandiloquent ? and explicit ? statements about " the meaning of life . " The Bicentennial " celebration " of our theater stopped just short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tennessee Williams remained , somewhat shakily , on their feet ? O'Neill simply because the debate about his talent has long since ground to a stalemate , with opinions polarized and adamant . My own view has always been that his reputation is inflated ; none of the recent revivals of his work that I 've seen has changed my mind ? nor , to judge from the reviews , the minds of his genius-mongering champions . With Tennessee Williams , on the other hand , the debate has sharpened : be 's been subjected to far more scrutiny over these past two years than any other playwright . Almost the entire corpus of his work was revived , often in multiple productions , often badly ; the Kennedy Center 's disastrous production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof probably did him the most disservice . Still , Streetcar and The Glass Menagerie , even when performed under mediocre auspices , unmistakably retain their power . How much else of Williams 's work will survive is problematic . Perhaps Summer and Smoke . Almost certainly not the equally touted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of which now seem badly compromised by overheated theatrics , creaky structures , and forced lyricism . Certainly there is no hope for any of his work from the past two decades . In all , not much of a theatrical heritage . Perhaps we should never have left the British Empire . Perhaps we should accommodate ourselves to the fact ? whatever its mysterious source ? that our important literary talents have always found fiction and poetry more congenial forms . F OR A BRIEF PERIOD in the Sixties , it seemed otherwise . There was a sudden surge of theatrical vitality , and from several quarters . The emergence of black playwrights and of an institutional theater , the Negro Ensemble Company , eager to nurture them , seemed for a time enormously promising . The two major talents were Charles Gordone ( No Place To Be Somebody ) and LeRoi Jones , but the first fell silent and the second turned his energies elsewhere . The Negro Ensemble Company still survives ( no small feat ) but in recent years has had scant impact . This past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two plays by Gus Edwards , a newcomer . The better of the two , The Offering , was hailed with that hyperbole which is the occupational disease of drama critics who , after spending endless evenings watching puerile drivel , understandably fall into instant rapture over a few literate lines , an offbeat characterization , or the hint of a special vision . For me , less subject to comparable nightly pressure , The Offering seemed little more than a shaky and self-conscious mismatch of ( bad ) Beckett-like word poems and an overemphatic naturalism that has long been characteristic ( from Lorraine Hansberry to Lonne Elder ) of mainstream black theater . But Gus Edwards did look like a titan when compared with the other highly publicized work this season by a black playwright ? Philip Hayes Dean 's Paul Robeson . Rhetorical , folksy , vacuous , the play was more than an artistic failure . It was a political disgrace . Robeson 's sustained commitment throughout his life to radical social change ? for which he paid dearly ? was shabbily diluted . And James Earl Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mannered and elocutionary , he hovered close at times to an obsequiousness that offensively caricatured Robeson 's granitic integrity . The night I attended , the audience gave the . play a standing ovation . Which tells us a lot about who goes to the theater these days and what values they want to find confirmed there . The second strong infusion of energy in the Sixties came out of the innovations of the " physical " theater , as it was then known : Joe Chaikin 's Open Theater , Judith Malina and Julian Beck 's Living Theater , the San Francisco Mime Troupe , and ? on a much lower level of interest ? Richard Schechner 's Performance Group . Today . ironically , only Schechner 's troupe survives in something like its original ( and ever more tedious and mechanical ) form . The others have either disbanded ( Open Theater I , degenerated into trite sloganeering ( S.F. Mime ) , or gone into exile ( Living Theater ) . How much those groups were tied to the ethos of the Sixties and dependent on its energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dybbuk . It resembled nothing so much as a sequel , less expertly done . to The Exorcist . The intricate body movements and vocal sounds which had served the Open Theater so well in its masterwork , The Serpent ? and far less well thereafter , when Chaikin began increasingly to repeat himself ? were , in The Dybbuk , mere mannerisms , mechanically inserted into the staging , serving no purpose other than to break the narrative line and dilute the play 's already limited dramatic resources . That the melodramatic old chestnut can still evoke a certain amount of pity and terror became apparent only because of Sonia Zomina 's performance as Freyda ; her authenticity unmasked the adolescent posturing being indulged all around her and clarified its destructive effect on the play 's integrity . It reminded me of the comparable demolition job Irene Worth did last year on Andre Serban 's misguided production of The Cherry Orchard ; by playing Madame Raney-sky with full-out emotion she broke through the ice-cold veneer Serban had imposed on the play and revealed the extent to which his " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demise of the " new " theater , concern for mere technical facility ( " Broadway know-how " ) has resumed and solidified its traditional sway . Elements meant to serve the script ? lights , costumes , sets , et cetera ? have increasingly supplanted it . The attempts made during the Sixties to reexamine the basic elements of theater ? text . ritual , performers , audience , space ? and their interrelationship have all but disappeared . The only experimental group of note that exists , Richard Foreman 's Ontological-Hysteric Theater , is ingenious and witty enough , but its playful pictorial adjustments do not seem to carry any profoundly innovative implications . Most of the " important " playwrights whose work first appeared in the Sixties have continued to write . But encouragement and outlets for serious work in the theater have shrunk to insignificance . The attitude of the Kennedy Center ? that dutiful creature of the cash culture ? is typical of today 's institutional theater . It judges success 4 , by the length of its subscription list and the number of tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in serving as a booking house for the banal musicals and comedies en route to or from Broadway . A few regional theaters do occasionally take a chance on a new play . A few workshop groups in New York still struggle , under impoverished conditions , to give new playwrights a hearing ( for example , the Interart Theater this year performed Susan Nanus ! s intricate and humane Where Memories Are Magic and Dreams Invented ; and Playwrights Horizons staged Anne Commire 's fine script Shay ? which had been shunted from hand to hand for years ) . p LAYWRIGHTS ? the weak , neurotic heasties ? do need productions to survive and develop ; need some confirmation of their worth : need the feedback that only professional collaborators and live audiences can provide . This season , three of the more prominent talents from the Sixties ? John Guare , Sam Shepard , and Maria Irene Fornes ? did finally get full-scale professional productions in New York , after having waited up to five years . All three , sadly , proved disappointing . And for much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even consolidation , of their talent . Perhaps they had been overpraised too soon . Perhaps they worked too long in debilitating isolation , No one can say for sure ; all theories about creativity ( or the lack of it ) are of dubious validity , none is susceptible to proof . I thought Guare 's new play , Landscape of the Body , the best of the three : Guare retains , even if he has not extended , an impressive ability to convey the bizarre flounderings of contemporary life . Few of the critics agreed . In the New Republic , Stanley Kauffmann , whose judgment I ordinarily respect , announced that Guare had " been pampered so long , one can doubt that he now has enough discipline to organize his modest talent into a realized play . " Not enough discipline ? If that were so , Guare would long since have deserted a profession that yields such minimal rewards for serious work , Pampered ? He has waited four years to see his current play mounted ? and given the general state of the theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If any playwright has been pampered , it 's Sam Shepard . When his first play was done in 1964 , Shepard was twenty-one years old . Since then , he 's had more productions and the most consistently good press of any playwright of his generation . And to my mind he has scarcely deserved it . His new work , Curse of the Starving Class , seems no exception . It is yet one more of his nightmare slices of American life , the metaphors stale ( Corporate Zombies Take Over The Farm ) , the ugly vision impervious to nuance . Shepard , I suspect , would like to think of his play as the theatrical counterpart of punk rock ( he has always been involved in the music scene ) , I hate to disappoint him , but I think he has closer ties to Thornton Wilder : high-flown allegorical allusions in tandem with unacknowledged sentimentality . Ten years ago , in the Boy on the Straight-Back Chair , Ron Tavel worked the same genre ( the horrors of everyday life in America ) with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots , and much less attitudinizing . Tavel has n't had , until this spring , even a minor New York production . Irene Fornes 's new play , Fefu and Her Friends , has drawn either raves or pans , almost nothing in between . The raves have predominated . Michael Fein-gold , the often astute chief critic of the Village Voice , wrote one of them : " Fefu ' is the only essential thing the New York theater has added to our cultural life in the past year . " I must assume that a compound of languor and stilted disconnection is the essential ingredient " our cultural life " has gained ? for that is all I can find in Fefu . The characters suffer from endemic malaise , but its source is shared neither among themselves nor with us ( " What is wrong ? " " Everything " ) . The predominant form of communication is windy monologue , punctuated by yawn-inspiring pronouncements ( " Hallucinations are real , you know " ) . Fornes is known in the theater world for her generosity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other playwrights produced . For that reason alone , I 'm glad she had a hit ( Fefu was the hottest Off-Broadway ticket in town ) . Forties is also known as a strong feminist . I 'm much less glad ( as a fellow traveler ) that her play is being promoted as a " feminist statement . " For I fail to see its contribution in that regard ? and think it 's more likely to be a disservice . Fornes 'S women are k given to pondering such propositions as " If people are swept off their feet , are the feet left behind ? " or to portentously announcing that " a woman 's entrails are the heaviest things on earth . " To be sure , these are Thirties feminists ? but we are listening to them in the Seventies . The complacent . foolishness of much of what they do and say may not be the least important THEATER reason so many established male critics have found so much to cheer about . T HE REAL CRITICAL ballyhoo , and much of the theatrical excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few works produced by Sixties ' veterans , but on what is being widely hailed as a " brilliant " new trio of young male play- it IA rights ? Thomas Babe , Albert Innaurato , and David Mamet . Of the three , Thomas Babe seems to me the most interesting , by a shade . Not because he 's had less media attention ? though ordinarily that 's a good rule of thumb to follow in ranking the critics ' choices ? but because in the context of our theater 's penurious imaginings , Babe 's insistent aplomb carries some intrinsic appeal . His first two plays , both done at Joseph Papp 's Public Theater , seemed merely ambitious ( Kid Champion had its moments , though they were hard to locate in the debris of a misconceived production ) . But Papp , as is his wont , kept the faith ; loyalty , not judgment , has always been his strong point . For once , he seems to have patted the head of a live toddler : Thomas Babe 's new play , A Prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play is set in a police precinct . Two officers interrogate , with predictable brutality , two suspects in a murder case : Jimmy , a young bisexual drug addict , and his protector/guru , Simon , a middle-aged , professorial-sounding gay man . Simon periodically refers to Jimmy , who has a baby girl of his own , as his " daughter . " Kelly , one of the police officers , also has a daughter . ( You divine early on that we 're in for a lot of prayers . ) Kelly 's daughter keeps phoning the station threatening to kill herself ? and ultimately does so . Kelly 's reaction to her threats is at once distraught and disengaged ; he tries to get others to intervene but backs off from going to his daughter 's aid himself . In an analogous way , Simon continually counsels and protects Jimmy ? but ultimately sells him down the river to save his own skin . Thus , Babe seems to be saying , does the predator male ? straight or gay ? use and then destroy the female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer serviceable to him , or tries to get too close to him , or threatens to detonate his controls . The theme is bold , hip ? and strained . That the play works at all ( and a fair amount of the time it does ) owes a great deal to the production . Robert Allan Ackerman directs what is an essentially lyrical piece as if it were The French Connection . Fortunately . His swift pacing rushes us past the set bits of fancy rhetoric , and his naturalistic stage inventions dilute and obscure * Babe 's more self-indulgent moments of mystical evocation . Two of the four actors , moreover , are splendid . Alan Rosenberg plays Jimmy with tender and total commitment , and George Dzundza 's portrayal of Kelly is marvelously finespun and understated . Their climactic scene together , in which the stark-naked Jimmy curls up into Kelly 's lap , is a wildly implausible epiphany of filial/sexual reconciliation that should n't work at all , yet the eye triumphs over the ear ? and the scene stays this side of parody . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of jarring false notes . The " daughter " parallels are drawn ? and redrawn ? with a heavy hand . The cops sometimes talk like Ph.D . candidates ( the kind likely to fail their orals ) . " That is a futile block , " says one detective . That is " heretical , mendacious shit ! " shouts the other , These lapses from character may be designed Ito put the best gloss on it ) to reveal the multiple personas we all harbor beneath our one-dimensional masks . But if so , the technique is clumsy ; the sudden shifts in style mostly register as annoying anomalies . All that said , there are still aspects of the play to admire . When Babe manages to control his affection for deep-think , he can write powerful dialogue I the same can he said for Sam Shepard , who is best at what he apparently considers least worthy : " realistic " language and interchange ) . There 's even ? a positive side to Babe 's penchant for metaphysics . Though it too often conies out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attractive ; Babe is alone among the new playwrights in imaginative daring , in attempting something more than surface renderings . He also has an offbeat comic sense ? as when he has one of the cops reading with absorption Mailer 's Prisoner of Sex and quoting aloud from it as a kind of bible of sex manuals . If Babe can tone down his elevated sonorities ( which wo n't be easy , since the critics favorably disposed to Prayer tended to praise it for its " philosophical depth " ) , he has a promising future . I AM LESS SURE ABOUT Albert Innaurato 's potential , though most of the critics seem to feel it 's unlimited . New York magazine , for example , called lnnaurato 's play Gemini " a stupendous verbal circus ... his control over simultaneously ongoing lines of action is somewhat akin to Bach 's mastery over fugues . " Bach , no less . Such overwrought praise is in the long run destructive to a playwright , not only because it encourages him to view himself as a finished monument , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demolition . Faddism is endemic in our culture , and tastes in theater shift with a velocity equal to that of the restaurant and disco worlds . Given to belated spasms of guilt , theater critics often compensate for their initial hyperbole by savagely lashing out at a playwright 's second work , though equally often it 's superior to the first . This is one reason why many of our promising writers for the thea ter never develop . It requires unusual strength of character to survive the quick alteration in image from world-beater to has-been , and to develop the patience needed to inhabit the fertile middle ground of uncertainty . Gemini is the better of lnnaurato 's two works produced in New York this season . That does n't say much , since the second , Ulysses in Traction , was semidroll trivia , and his teleplay , Verna : USO Girl ( also shown this season , on PBS ) , was such a mechanical stockpile of romantic cliches that I began to expect a cameo by , or at least a screen credit for , Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Off-Broadway group that has the most distinguished record in New York ? far better than Papp 's ? for introducing worthwhile new plays . Among its past productions have been Mark Medoff 's When You Com.in ' Back , Red Ryder ? , Edward Moore 's The Sea Horse , Jules Feiffer 's Knock , Knock , and half-a-dozen plays by its resident guru , Lanford Wilson . Gemini is among Circle 's biggest commercial successes ; within a few months of opening , it moved to Broadway and has been playing to packed houses ever since . But its artistic merit seems to me dubious . Gemini is set in the backyard of a row of tenement houses in a working-class district of South Philadelphia . The story centers on Francis Geminiani , a scholarship student at Harvard , home to spend the summer with his father ( his mother having deserted years ago ) and a wacky assortment of neighbors straight out of Mad Comics . Francis gets an unexpected visit from two of his classmates : Judith , his girlfriend , and Randy , her younger brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long been secretly directed at Randy . " I ? I think I 'm queer , " Francis blurts out to Judith early in Act I. What follows is a tangled merry-go-round whose outer mechanics Innaurato expertly controls but whose inner life rarely resonates above a guffaw . Laughs are frequent enough to establish Innaurato as a genuinely gifted comic writer . Grotesquerie is his forte . The best example in Gemini is Herschel , a mountainous teen-ager next door who is " into " Transportation . Herschel is contrived and bizarre ? yet believable ; more so than most of Innaurato 's other grotesques . The play 's exaggerated theatricality , its breathless ( and nicely timed ) antics and pratfalls , fail to conceal basic flaws in construction . Too often static monologues ? awkwardly introduced , insufficiently motivated ? are used to fill us in on information Innaurato has been unable to convey in any more integral way . He further interrupts the narrative flow by pausing for show-off turns ? some overly cute or irrelevantly literary lines , sometimes an extended " bit " ( like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These set pieces and asides do more than disrupt the play 's momentum : they create distrust for the playwright 's integrity . He seems willing to rob his own characters of coherence in order to get off a quick gag , to risk knocking a scene off-center rather than forgo some circus byplay . The more Innaurato opts for secondary surface effects , the more we begin to wonder if he has any pressing primary purpose . The play 's cheap ending confirms all earlier misgivings . It first seems as if the play will end with Francis sitting moodily alone on stage , having just let Judith and Randyleave for Boston without him . His isolation , ambivalence , and sadness seem an appropriate summation for what we have been led to believe are the essential ingredients of his feelings about being " queer . " But instead of the curtain falling , Francis suddenly rises ? jolting us with the rousing cry , " Jesus ! What am I doing ! " Bedlam breaks loose on stage . Francis packs his things , his father presses cash into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Randy , the assorted neighbors whoop with joy . Within minutes , a reunited Judith and Francis go off into the sunset as Francis 's father bellows out the triumphant last line ? " I think they 're going to make it ! " Curtain . Roar of approval from the audience . So much for the psychosexual dilemma we had presumed to be at the heart of Francis 's character ? and the play . Having sold his own play down the river , Innaurato must have been startled indeed at Ross Wetzsteon 's attack on it in the Village Voice as " gayist " ( i.e. , " chauvinistically " antiheteroscxual ) . Well , you ca n't please everyone , try as you might . w E COME NOW TO David Mamet , the third and by far most heralded of the trio of new luminaries . Of his three plays produced this year ( probably an unprecedented number ) , American Buffalo was the first to open ( on Broadway ) . The critical reception was ? well , tumultuous . " A gripping and exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater experience , " Martin Gottfried wrote in the New York Post . Clive Barnes exclaimed in the Times , " The man can write ! " A number of critics likened the excitement of Mamet 's Broadway debut to the opening of Albee 's Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? The play won the Drama Critics Circle Award for best American play of the 1977 season . Soon after American Buffalo , A Life in the Theater opened at one of Off-Broadway 's largest houses , the De Lys . Again the reviews were overwhelmingly favorable , and the play seems settled in for a long run . Mamet 's third play , The Water Engine , opened this past January at Papp 's Public Theater ( though it originated elsewhere ) , got all but unanimous raves , and was quickly transferred to Broadway . Mamet 's biggest commercial success to date ? A Life in the Theater ? is at the same time his least characteristic play . Ordinarily he works from an oblique angle of vision , in flat tones . Life is all surface flamboyance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in short , closer to a Feydeau farce than to the Beckett-like minimalism to which Mamet more typically aspires . The play is a duet between two actors ? the older one a stereotypical ham , the younger a stereotypical Actors Studio grunter ? and is structured as a series of alternating backstage and onstage " bits . " At its best , Life is a mildly amusing diversion ; at its more frequent worst , it is a tedious , offensively banal caricature of what daily life in the theater is actually like . The sheer awkwardness of the play surprised me , since Mamet is the most technically proficient of the new writers . In The Water Engine he manages skillfully to juxtapose a 1930s radio play about an idealistic young inventor pursued by the evil forces of corporate greed with the inane chatter of a " Century of Progress " tour guide ? and , in addition , intercuts ominous injunctions from a chain letter , which the actors take turns in reading out . Where the transitions in Life are amateurishly abrupt or nonexistent , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , Steven Schachter ) interweaves his triangulated tale with such dexterity that we 're absorbed into the intricate shifts of time , place , and mood . Initially , that is . Once we catch on to the alternations in rhythm , the play 's fascination rapidly evaporates . Schachter 's stunning production ? especially the marvelous simulation of radio sound effects ? keeps us from lapsing into outright boredom . Eventually-anger takes over instead ? that so much is being put at the service of so little . Mamet has subtitled the play An American Fable . Well , yes ? if you believe our culture ( like our theater ) is best seen as an allegory of emptiness . Something more is going on in American Buffalo . Something to do with people . The play has three characters : Don , a man in his late forties who runs a junkshop ; his crony , Teach , a middle-aged petty criminal ; and Bob , a street punk in his early twenties , who runs indeterminate errands for Don and halfheartedly listens to his homilieg about life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who your friends are , and who treated you like what " ) . Like Babe and Innaurato , Mamet is attracted to the lumpen underside of contemporary life . Unlike Babe , he finds no lyrical profundities in it . Unlike Innaurato , he finds no resources for humor in it , grotesque or otherwise . He finds robots . And invents for them a suitable robot language . Sample dialogue : DON : I got him all spotted . Pause TEACH : Who ? BOB : Some guy . TEACH : Yeah ? BOB : Yeah . TEACH : Where 's he live ? BOB : Around . TEACH : Where ? Near here ? Boa : No . TEACH : No ? Boa : He lives on Lake Shore Drive , TEACH : He does . BOB : Yeah . They are preparing , you see , to steal a reputedly valuable coin collection . They never do , Why ? Apparently ? as the dialogue attests ? because no one can get up the energy . They prefer to sit around and repeat each other 's opaque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) into query ( " No ? " ) . They also , now and then , languorously collide . We 're never sure about what . And we soon cease to care . Perhaps Mamet had yet another fabulistic moral in mind . I refuse to guess at it . Two can play at his game . It should be noted , however , that the game is a highly mannered one , full of falsity . If Mamet believes that by flattening his tone to a deadbeat monotony he has captured the authentic lowlife rhythm , he should be encouraged to spend more time on the streets . If , as seems more likely , he believes that s by emptying language of content and flair he will automatically uncover deeper subtexts , he ought to reread ? it is clear he has read them once ? the true masters of unspoken resonance , Beckett and Pinter . Silence can be eloquent speech , banal words can transmute into subtle metaphor ? but only when the surrounding context has been properly prepared . When it has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Buffalo abounds .
