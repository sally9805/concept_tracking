Numbered highways mark major advance routes . Military strategists believe Hanoi must choose between seizing Phnom Penh itself or letting the rebels take the capital before a truce is demanded internationally . Story : Page 6 After a week of fierce fighting , Cambodian rebels backed by Vietnamese forces have occupied nearly one fourth of the country and are poised a mere 35 miles from the capital Phnom Penh . According to military analysts , Hanoi has two options at this stage of the battle : either to make a headlong dash and capture Phnom Penh or to encircle and completely isolate the capital and let the rebels handle the final assault on the crumbling last defenses of the Pol Pot regime .

Vietnam has solidified ties with the Soviet Union , which has Security Council veto power , by signing a friendship treaty with a defense clause in it . On the other hand , China , another permanent member of the Security Council with a veto , is Hanoi 's arch foe and Phnom Penh 's fervent ally . While there could be a stalemate in the Security Council , the scene of war in the rice paddies of Cambodia presents a completely different picture .

The official Cambodian Radio revealed that eight separate battlefronts along the entire Cambodian-Vietnamese border had been opened up by the invading forces and that one column had reached 35 miles north of the capital along the Mekong River . Kratie was reported to have fallen with Kompong Cham under siege . Earlier on Jan. 2 , the Cambodian armed forces chief of staff called on the Phnom Penh Defense Command to stand ready to defend the capital and head of state Khieu Samphan in a speech to the nation called for help from all countries and the UN to halt the Vietnamese offensive .

In any case , China has shown no signs of physically getting involved in the Cambodian conflict . Whatever the immediate outcome of the battle , the fall of the Pol Pot regime will come as a severe blow to China and will cause uneasiness among non-Communist Southeast Asian countries , especially Thailand , which has a common border with Cambodia . The Chinese and the Pol Pot regime appear to be anticipating the eventuality of the Cambodian government waging a guerrilla warfare against the Hanoi-backed rebels .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
