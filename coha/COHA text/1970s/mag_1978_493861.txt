compounding away at six percent . Joe must subtract the government 's share from his five percent each year and then reinvest what 's left . Over the years , it makes a big difference . The " deferral " effect ( as it is called ) enjoyed by Rockefeller and Aunt Millie amounts to an interest-free loan from the government . And of course Joe gets no capital gains deduction , so he pays two and a half times as much tax . And there are no taxes for his heirs to escape when he dies , because he has paid them all as he went along . A real tear-jerker , is n't it ? Since Congress closed the tax shelter for money-losing film investments in 1976 , it 's no longer reasonable to hope for a movie based on the Internal Revenue Code . But if only to restore their own self-esteem , the authors should rewrite the script . White House Watch Ratchet Racket After meeting with Jimmy Carter at the White House last September 22 , senators Alan Cranston of Califor ? nia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motored back to the Capitol with them that the President had impressed them during a discussion of pending veterans pension legislation . Cranston is chairman and Talmadge is the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Committee on Veterans ' Affairs . They and their opposites on the House veterans committee had been trying to work out a conference compromise on increased pension levels . Carter had summoned the chief Senate and House conferees to the White House to tell them what he would and would n't accept and what he expected in the way of pension reforms . Cranston and Talmadge said that Carter had mastered the details of a complex subject , that he had made his expectations . and requirements clear and that he had dealt skillfully with his visitors . He had never mentioned " veto . " He had said that he knew they would act " responsibly " and that if they did he would sign the pension bill Congress sent him . Congress sent him a bill that was costly but less costly than either the original House or Senate versions would have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowing the definitions of eligibility for pensions and stiffening the requirement that veterans and survivors in equal circumstances be treated equally . On October 18 Carter signed a related bill , sponsored by Cranston , that increased the levels of compensation to veterans with service-connected disabilities ? a benefit distinct from pensions ? and increased thenumber of veterans and survivors of veterans entitled to disability compensation . He said when signing the disability bill that he was " looking forward " to signing the pension bill . It was then being revised in line with the requirements that he had stated on September 22 and that some of his assistants had elaborated in a meeting with House and Senate veterans committee staffs on September 25 . What is and is not implied by the headline on this account must be stated . " Racket " as used here does not mean crookery . It does mean that an interested party , soon to be identified , raised a loud and effective noise ? a racket ? about a " ratchet " that may or may not exist . The interested party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tiny circle where it originated . And finally , before getting into the story , a few elementary facts about the veterans scene must be summarized in order to make the story understandable . At the end of September 1,024,064 living veterans and 1,637,000 survivors of dead veterans were drawing pensions . The law signed by Carter November 4 raised the basic pension for an eligible veteran with no dependents from $2364 to $3550 per year . Pensions for veterans with dependents or with ailments that kept them " house-bound " and/or requiring " aid &; atten ? dance " could rise to amounts near double the basic allowance . Under recent law and the new law pen ? sioners have to be technically though often not really disabled , either by age or infirmity , and under the new law they and their spouses must have very little or no income other than the pension . The old law allowed a pensioner much more additional income . Surviving spouses ( usually but in these days not always widows ) are allowed two thirds of what a veteran is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and historically , it is really a minimum guaranteed income for needy veterans and their survivors . The new law emphasizes provable need and thereby makes the pension closer to a minimum allowed income in reality than it previously was . The President 's Office of Management and Budget calculates that the new law will add about two billion dollars to pension costs over the next five years and , if not screwed up by Congress in the meantime , will begin to save money in or around 1987 . The Congressional Budget Office is in approximate agree ? ment with these estimates . Disability compensation is something else . " Service-connected disability " is a loose term but generally it means wounds in combat or ailments demonstrably resulting from a veteran 's military service . Disability ratings , which determine the level of compensation , range from zero ( that 's right ) to 100 percent . Twenty seven thousand people with disability ratings from zero to 10 percent received military compensation payments as of September 30 . On that date 1,794,871 living veterans and 463,919 survivors received compensation payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to degrees of physical impairment . They are calculations of the proportion of income that a disabled veteran could earn if he or she were not disabled . It is assumed , for instance , that a veteran who lost a leg in combat and has a 60 percent disability rating earns only 40 percent as much money as he would if he had both his legs . Some 82 percent of all veterans eligible for and receiving compensation payments have 60 percent or lower disability ratings . The largest number , 876,000 , are rated 10 percent disabled . Totally ( 100 percent ) disabled veterans are eligible for tax-free annual payments of $27,000 , a grant of $30,000 toward the purchase or remodeling of a house they can live in , $3800 toward the purchase or reequipment of a car they can drive and other perquisites . The 122,000 totally disabled veterans drawing benefits at this level on September 30 included Max Cleland , the head of the Veterans Administration , and Robert Muller , founder and director of the Council of Vietnam Veterans , Inc . Cleland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spine was severed by an enemy bullet in Vietnam . A VA press spokesman and the CVV 's counsel and lobbyist , Stuart Feldman , said in late November that Cleland and Muller were drawing the compensation for which they are eligible . Disability compensation is in addition to all other income , in this instance Cleland 's and Muller 's government and council salaries . Concerned officials are fond of saying , sometimes in rather disgruntled tones , that Nelson Rockefeller could draw his tax-free $27,000 a year ? increased 7.3 percent by this year 's law ? if he were a totally disabled veteran . Muller and Feldman , especially Feldman , are central figures in our story . Their and their council 's guiding view is that Vietnam veterans should get a bigger share of available federal money than they are getting . The council claims no membership and is mainly financed by what Feldman calls " the eastern chapter " of the Paralyzed Veterans of America . Paralyzed veterans are , by definition , eligible for the federal benefits previously enumerated . The council is fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct from service-connected compensation for veterans . Its unstated but basic premise is that many -- -maybe most , conceivably all ? Vietnam veterans suffer from dis ? abilities that are service-connected in the sense that they served in a lousy war that nobody loves or wants to be reminded of . The council 's bible is a report issued in 1956 by a commission headed by retired General Omar Bradley . The Bradley commission concluded that the widening system of Social Security and other minimal support for all Americans should be relied on to care for merely needy veterans and that " within the not too distant future a separate veterans ' pension program should no longer be necessary . " Feldman , a lawyer who is a veteran of Washington 's welfare wars but not of military service and war , is the council 's front-line battler . Some of his adversaries in congressional , executive and veterans **25;2578;TOOLONG welcome the fact that they deal with Feldman rather than with Muller , who is paralyzed from the chest down . " My God , " a senior member of a congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't kick around a paraplegic . " The staffer feels free to kick around but can not ignore Feldman , who in the committee assistant 's view is a fount of distorted information . This reporter shares that view while giving Feldman credit for dedication , knowledge of his subject and the guts to fight for what he believes . One of his beliefs is that the pension law recently signed by Carter will have a disastrous " ratchet effect " on the future cost of veterans ' compensation . A connected proposition is that the assistants upon whom Carter relied for advice before he signed the bill did n't understand this or , if they did , kept the facts and understanding from the President . This " ratchet " business has a revealing history . Feldman picked up the term in late October from a friend who once served in the federal budget bureau . " Ratchet " in bureau parlance means or used to mean the final squeezing and wrenching of departmental and agency budget requests down to totals within the limits set by presidents and , recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the effect of budget levels and increases upon future budget levels and federal costs . A testament to his extraordinary impact is the fact that budget and other officials are beginning to give " ratchet " the meaning that Feldman mistakenly gave it . In a letter dated November 1 and addressed to 15 " key White House assistants , " Feldman argued that the increased pension levels of the new pension bill would inevitably cause disabled veterans to demand and Congress to grant increases in disability compensation amounting over the next five years to $9.5 billion . Including the added first-year cost of the pension bill , the total " ratchet effect " would ? he said ? be at least $11.5 billion . In a letter dated November 8 to Bert Carp , a deputy chief of Carter 's domestic policy staff , Feldman jumped the five-year " ratchet effect " in added disability costs to $30 billion . This came about as follows . Feldman put together and the Congressional Quarterly printed a table showing that since 1945 basic disability compensation levels and costs had increased every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ratios varied from year to year . Nevertheless , the unbroken sequence of dual increases enabled Feldman to argue that pension increases were connected to and were invariably followed by compensation increases . He submitted the table and the conclusion he drew from it to Alair Townsend , a House budget committee analyst . She asked Kathleen ( Nina ) Shepherd , a Congressional Budget Office statistician and analyst , to project the cost over the next five years of maintaining the ratio between present disability compensation levels and the increased basic pension levels provided in the new pension bill . Shepherd was asked to assume , and did assume , that Congress would vote the annual increases in compensation payments necessary to maintain the ratio , having in mind that Congress in the new pension bill had mandated annual cost-of-living increases in the basic pension levels . Shepherd came up with a five-year added compensation cost of $30.2 billion and passed this figure to Town ? send . She and Feldman say that he got it from somebody else . Thus was born Feldman 's revised " ratchet effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said on November 29 that the Shepherd projection was never cleared with him and CBO director Alice Rivlin and therefore is not a certified CBO projection . Its only official sanction to date is that it appears as a speculative figure in one of Alair Townsend 's " issue papers . " Shepherd and Townsend say that they do not assume that Congress actually will do what the projection assumes it will do . Blum says that CBO certainly does not assume it . Spokesmen for the American Legion , Veterans of Foreign Wars and Disabled American Veterans , the old-line veterans ' organizations most likely to react to the new pension levels as Feldman assumes , said in late November that their organizations had no intention of demanding compensation increases on the scale predicted by Feldman . Feldman called his new ratchet figure a " CBO projection " and " CBO information " when he passed it to journalists and officials . He accused White House and Office of Management and Budget assistants of frustrating efforts to get the projection and its implications to Carter before he signed the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's new anti-inflation counsellor , with the projection and told reporters that Kahn wished he had advised the President to veto the bill . Dennis Rapp , Kahn 's chief assistant and Feldman 's friend of many years , guesses that Kahn may have advised a veto if he 'd been on the inflation job long enough to review the pension bill adequately . Rapp says that Kahn was n't on board soon enough to make any pension recommendation to the President and rejects the story , put around by Feldman , that other advisers saw to it that Kahn never had a chance to advise Carter to veto the bill . Carter had to accept or veto the bill by Monday evening , November 6 . Kahn , Rapp and two staff specialists on veterans ' affairs , Ellen Goldstein at the White House and Suzanne Woolsey at OMB , did n't know when they came to work Monday morning that the White House press office had announced the previous day that the President had signed the pension bill and seven others Saturday , November 4 . Kahn thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he discussed the possibility with Woolsey . She believed Feldman 's ratchet theory was phony . She also believed that the pension levels in the new bill were excessive andpotentially inflationary , and she so informed Kahn . Nevertheless , she also told Kahn , only the director of OMB , James T. McIntyre Jr. , could speak for it and in any event she agreed with everyone else involved that the President was morally and politically obligated to sign the bill .
