Before the Watergate scandal broke open , nearly every morning a precisely attired man walked into Coco 's , a restaurant in the rich resort town of Newport Beach , Calif . Sitting down at the same corner table , he picked up the morning newspaper and began sipping his coffee . After a polite pause , he was approached by local businessmen and politicians , who , one by one , stated their business , received their reply , and moved on so the next man could have a chance . The ritual sometimes took as long as 2 hours . <P> All appearances to the contrary , however , Herbert W. Kalmbach in those halcyon days was neither a political boss , a godfather of the Mafia nor the local bookie . He was President Nixon 's personal lawyer and one of the best connections between California and power centers in Washington . <P> <P> Though " recently he has kind of been disowned " by the White House , as one Nixon aide puts it , Kalmbach , 52 , has long been one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Lord himself , " says Don Kennedy , president of an insurance company Kalmbach worked for in 1961 . Kalmbach first worked for Nixon in the 1960 presidential campaign and was a fund raiser in the disastrous gubernatorial race two years later . " He was constantly at Nixon 's side , puffed up with authority and having complete say how and when the money was to be spent , " says a colleague from those days . In the lean years that followed for Nixon , he stood fast as one of the few true believers , and as early as 1967 he helped Nixon start up his second presidential campaign . <P> Offered a job as Under Secretary of Commerce , Kalmbach decided instead to return to Newport Beach and the law practice he had set up in 1967 . It was a profitable move . Starting off with only four attorneys , Kalmbach , who had little reputation as a lawyer , built his firm into one of California 's , and perhaps the nation 's , most successful . He rapidly acquired an impressive roster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lines ; the Travelers Insurance Company ; the Flying Tiger Corporation ; Dart Industries Inc. ; the Marriott Corporation ; MCA Inc. , which produces perhaps 40% of prime-time TV shows ; and the California Federal Savings and Loan Assn . <P> Kalmbach 's law firm , which now has 26 lawyers and penthouse offices in Los Angeles as well as an office at Newport Beach , is famous for its ability to get quick , and often favorable , rulings from Government agencies . " I 've been to meetings with Kalmbach attorneys in which an IRS agent would be there to explain things , " marvels one client . For Client Richard Nixon , Kalmbach was a personal tax consultant , and he arranged the still mysterious , highly favorable deal by which the President acquired his San Clemente estate . <P> <P> The Kalmbach family moved to Pasadena from Michigan ( his father had died ) when Herb was a young teenager . Frank Clement , who became his best schoolboy friend , remembers the newcomer as " a free and loose kid , an absolute nut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of Germanic origins , Kalmbach was a fleeting , childish admirer of Hitler before World War II broke out , writing some stories about the Reich in the school paper . Remarkably , he was one of four finalists in a design competition for an airplane de-icer that the U.S. needed , even though , recalls Clement , he was only 13 or 14 when he submitted his idea .
