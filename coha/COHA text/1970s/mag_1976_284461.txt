On another front and in far more direct fashion , business was also fighting back at its treatment by the press . The protesters were oil companies , and the focus of their ire was a five-part look at gasoline prices broadcast last month on WNBC-TV , the network-owned station in New York City . The mini-series was aired in daily segments of about five minutes each on the early evening news broadcast . Several oil companies privately expressed displeasure at the coverage , and one , Mobil , went public with its complaints , purchasing nearly $36,000 worth of full-page advertisements in local newspapers to denounce the series as " a parade of warmed-over distortions , half-truths , and downright untruths . " <P> The ads accused WNBC-TV Investigative Reporter Liz Trotta of 18 specific " hatchet jobs . " Some of Mobil 's contentions were minor . At one point , for instance , Trotta asked : " If there 's a surplus of oil , then why has n't the price of gasoline gone down ? " Mobil 's complaint was , in part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 20 a gallon . But other Mobil points about inaccurate or loaded reporting were sharper . Among them : <P> Reporter Trotta cited 1973 and 1974 reports that " tankers loaded with millions of gallons of oil were waiting offshore in New York Harbor " at the height of the oil shortage . But there was no mention , as Mobil felt there should have been , of later investigations that failed to support the parked-tankers stories . <P> At one point , during a discussion of company resistance to proposals to break up big oil firms , Trotta talked about difficulties legislators have in getting information from the oil industry . She then ran a film clip from a Senate hearing showing Senator Henry M. Jackson getting angry at an oil company executive who could not immediately recall his company 's recent dividends . Although the Senate had hearings on oil industry competition last fall , WNBC 'S film came from a 1974 hearing on oil company profits . <P> During a segment on dealer relations with the oil companies , one station operator was shown complaining that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street is that the oil companies do n't get caught . " Then WNBC cut straight to an oil executive saying , " It is true , we 're not willing to subsidize an economic loss at a marginal station . " The juxtaposition , as Mobil saw it , was a " cheap distortion . " <P> Last January Mobil executives were invited to be interviewed for the series . They kept putting off an appearance until it was too late , explaining in the ad that they did not want their remarks to be edited . Said Mobil Spokesman Raymond D'Argenio : " We 've been screwed too many times by people coming in here , talking to us for a half-hour or an hour and then excerpting two minutes of one of our guys scratching his nose .
