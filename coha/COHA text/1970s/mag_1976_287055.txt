Entering Boston 's Beth Israel Hospital for surgery , Carol Wein , 22 , of Brookline , Mass. , wondered at first if she had come to the wrong place . Instead of the usual sterile hospital lobby , she found a large , warmly decorated room with brightly colored window hangings and a garden of potted palms and dra-caenas off to the side . In the second-floor admissions area , she was interviewed , not at a crowded public desk but in a small , tastefully decorated private office . Corridors were carpeted and traditional hospital smells and white walls were conspicuously absent . After Wein settled into her stylishly furnished , pastel-colored private room ( $180 a day ) , the head nurse entered and cheerfully announced : " Carol , you have rights in this hospital and I want to explain them to you . " <P> Carol 's pleasant welcome reminded her of an episode from TV 's Medical Center . But Beth Israel , a major teaching facility of Harvard Medical School , is a real-life institution . Opened only a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's posh 176-bed Feldberg Building has already won a reputation among patients as the hotel with nurses and operating rooms . It is far more than that . More than a decade in the planning , the wing caps a long campaign by Beth Israel 's innovative director , Dr. Mitchell Rabkin , 45 , to ensure patients a " full bill of rights , " which he feels is long overdue . As the Harvard-educated endocrinologist puts it : " We have reached the point where doctors and hospitals can really tyrannize patients . " <P> Full Explanation . That tyranny has been ended at Beth Israel . Soon after patients enter the hospital , they are given a little blue and white brochure . It tells them , among other things , what they are guaranteed : the best possible care regardless of the form of payment ; a full explanation of their illness and treatment ; knowledge of who is in charge of their care ; and the privilege of leaving the hospital at any time , even over a doctor 's objections . <P> One of Rabkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot line for patients , " which enables them to call direct from their rooms to the hospital service manager if a bulb burns out or the kitchen is late in delivering dinners ordered from one of the seven different room-service menus . Says Rabkin : " I have seen a lumpy mattress replaced within 20 minutes of the hotline call . " <P> The director periodically reviews the log of calls-and the responses to them - to keep the staff on its toes . He may also take other action ; even his fellow doctors are not spared Rabkin 's criticism . After he discovered that a patient had been left unattended in a corridor , he rebuked the physician responsible ( without naming him ) in his weekly " Dear Doctor " memo to the staff . Explains Rabkin : " A patient 's rights brochure is not worth the paper it is printed on if it does not reflect an institutional commitment . " At Beth Israel , whose bright new wing is attracting many patients , the commitment is apparently real . As Trustee Eliot Snider explains : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
