In his time , the Dutch artist Maurits Cornelis Escher seemed a cultural anomaly . He loathed modern art- " I consider 60% of the artists nuts and fakes , " he said of Amsterdam 's Stedelijk Museum-and was duly ignored by it . For most of his working life , critics dismissed him as a pedantic illustrator . Born in 1898 , Escher was 52 before his tightly executed woodcuts , lithographs and engravings began to attract even a crumb of attention . A retiring , ironic man with the bony nose and goat beard of an El Greco prelate , Escher took no part in art debates , lived quietly in a village outside Amsterdam , and made few claims for his work . It was improvisation , he insisted : his prints contained nothing that they did not openly state . " Do I have to say that none of these fantasies have any pretension to profoundness ? I regard them only as the results of a fascinating play of thoughts . " <P> Vivid Warning . Yet when Maurits Escher died last month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Through many channels , from head-shop posters to science magazines , Escher had been insinuated into world currency . A lavish book , The Complete World of M.C. Escher , will shortly be published by Abrams . This week an almost complete exhibition of his graphics opens at the Vorpal Gallery in San Francisco , where the prints Escher sold for $ 17 to $40 two decades ago are being offered at $2,000 to $ 15,000 . <P> The question is : Why ? Considered as a formal artist , Escher was virtually negligible . His use of color was dull and his drawing had a serviceably vulgar look : the way Escher described the human figure , for instance , made Norman Rockwell look like Giorgione . Much of his architectural imagery is supermarket Piranesi . <P> But Escher 's asset was an intricately schematic intelligence , and this he used with such wit and patience that he became , without modern rival , a master of visual paradox . A great many of Escher 's prints were about teasingly blocked situations . They are scientific demonstrations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of n-dimensional reality in which the laws of perception are temporarily repealed . The most innocent images contain excruciating traps . <P> One example is Escher 's Waterfall ( 1961 ) . A water mill with columns that carry the mill stream above the wheel ? Not quite . On close examination , the building is incredible . The water is flowing uphill . The columns and the millrace could never be built : they are contradictory . So Escher 's water mill , turning in perpetual motion through a kind of dimensional warp , becomes a vivid warning that art is not reality . <P> Escher 's work was involved with many of the notions current in the more abstract sciences . The obsessive patternmaking , which appeared after he saw the Moorish tilework in the Alhambra during a visit to Spain in 1932 , became a visual demonstration of field theory - for there is no " foreground " or " background " in Escher 's mosaics . The outline of one figure instantly becomes the boundary of another .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
