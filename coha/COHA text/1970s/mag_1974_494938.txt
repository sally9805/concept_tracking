vostok , which is located in territory claimed by China , as a way of scaring Peking into a less intransigent line . The real problem on both sides is largely internal . The Peking leadership can not compromise on Taiwan without arousing the hostility of Chinese factions that have consistently looked for a pretext to attack the new US relationship . And the Ford administration can not unilaterally abrogate the US commitment to Taiwan without incurring the wrath of right-wing Republicans , who would accuse it of abandoning the island to the Communists , and liberal Democrats , who would assail the President for violating the rights of the Taiwanese to determine their own status . A critical element in the current equation that wor ? ries both Washington and Peking is the prospect that the government on Taiwan may give up its illusory notion that it represents all of China and declare the independence of the island . Such a step would damage Sino-American relations for years to come .

The glop oozed in the cooking pan in a lava-spread of fakery .

It presents itself as the saver of the race : " Our members are concerned with the ad ? vancement and application of new and existing knowl ? edge to the improvement of the food supply for the benefit of mankind . " But there 's a hearty appetite for profits as well . Stein-Hall tells buyers : " To pile up more sales , look into food modified tapioca for flavor encapsulations .

" It is as though these companies were announcing that the Second Creation has come and in the new Garden of Eden stands a tree from which the Almighty Chemists hang a fake apple . Indeed , in the tradition of proud devils , one firm goes beyond Mother Nature to take on God the Father : Seacor , in ocean kelp , states that " All algins come from the same original manufacturer .

" It is not that science and chemicals are dirty words ? such a dismissal ignores the many benefits to come from the labs ? but that citizens have become an experimental control group . Citizens too busy to keep up with the food industry tend to think of additives ? average per capita consumption is five pounds a year ? as those long unpronounceable names listed in small print among the can or box labels , but manu facturers ' vats contain not only large measures of the tetrasodium pyrophosphates or sodium carbosyme - thycelluloses ( two of the 32 additives allowed by law in ice cream , 50 percent of which can be air ) , but also such common additives as salt or sugar .

Health authorities keep warning that excessive salt - ? intake is involved in such threats to human life as high blood pressure , obesity , heart disease and tooth decay . Even for those who are willing to take their chances with additives and fakery , the busyness of the technologists means something else : we have raised a whole generation on fake foods , made possible by * chemicals bolstering fat , water and carbohydrates , and void of vitamins , proteins and minerals . Children are more familiar with Cool Whip than cooled fruit , Corn Diggers instead of freshly dug vegetables . Senate hearings on television revealed that 70 percent of all the TV advertising directed at children is for sweets or snacks . Parents who dare serve their teenagers a real potato risk being told that it " tastes funny .

In the shopping aisles , citizens see the newest product ? such as Egg Beaters , the fake eggs from Fleischmann 's which cost * about 50 percent more than hen 's eggs , or Pringles , the reconstituted potato chip packaged saddle shape for nearly two dollars per pound . The competition to reach the aisles is fierce . In 1969 , 9450 items were intro ? duced into supermarkets but less than 20 percent fulfilled the sales goals of their producers . That rep - resents a lot of flops , meaning that pressure is on the chemists not to refine old foods but to create new ones . Once a god in the lab is finished creating a " food , " others in the company will decide what to charge the public , keeping in mind that the price of the successful ? items must also carry the cost of the failures . A vice president of research and product development at At Libby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 the " corporate view of new product development . " It " is important to understand that a product can not be expected to be a winner forever . It will most certainly suffer declines for any number of reasons . A good management realizes this and is prepared to constantly introduce new products or modified products which will be capable of generating new profit dollars for the firm at the time when those older products are be ? ginning to suffer profit declines . " On whether the public actually needs any of the new products the technologists feverishly create , the man from Libby was candid : " The implicit assumption behind any new product development program is that there is a consumer need in the marketplace which must be filled , and that the company which is successful in developing a product or service to satisfy that need will enjoy success in the marketplace . However , today 's consumers really do n't need anything in the way of new products , but they are constantly search ? ing for something just a little bit better or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum and asks if there is any way to add another kind of orange juice product to the segmented market and make a profit on it , the immediate temptation is to ask , ' who needs it ? " Rather than being put off by that question , " a company could come along with an orange juice product to which additional color or sweetness has been added , or to which an important nutritional component has been added and do well with it in the marketplace . " The last is exactly what many food companies have been doing . Just when the public is learning that much of its food is nutritionally worthless , products are now being " fortified . " The alert manufacturer has it both ways . In the past he made nutritional bilge ? flavor and color added ? but now he adds vitamins to persuade shoppers that the bilge is good for them . Thus Kool-Aid is now fortified , as are Hostess Twink ? ies . The vitamins serve as cheap sales come-ons ; they turn foods into vitamin pills that do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of sugar , fat and salt . As for the economics of food fortification , Michael Jacobson of Washington 's Center for Science in the Public Interest and author of Nutrition Score ? board examined the methods of General Mills . " It makes both Wheaties and Total . They are identical except that Total is fortified with one-third cents worth more vitamins . That one-third cents becomes twenty cents at the supermarket . It 's cheaper to buy Wheaties and a multi-vitamin than to buy Total . " Jacobson , an MIT Ph.D . in microbiology , is well known to the food technologists . For the past three years he has been showing up at their annual meet ? ings to award his Bon Vivant Vichyssoise Memorial Prize . The award is a garbage can . In 1973 the winner was General Mills for such trashcan foods as Kaboom , Sir Grapefellow , Baron von Redberry and Franken Berry , all cereals containing between 30 and 50 percent sugar . Jacobson called them more candy than cereal . This year 's Bon Vivant garbage can went to Gerber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to food tech ? nologists , " Jacobson says , " everyone points the finger at the other guy . Oh yes , sugar is a problem but our candy is only a minor part of anyone 's diet ; we do n't intend it to replace real food . Our Jell-O is intended to be eaten in moderation . Soda pop , yes , contains sugar but no one eats enough soda to ingest too much sugar . Every segment of the industry disclaims responsibility . Yet , the fact is , that several hundred thousand Ameri ? cans are dying prematurely every year because of the food they eat . . The food industry puts the blame on the American public , saying that it consists of nutri ? tional fools . Yet , on the other hand , the industry says of its so-called pleasure foods that it is only giving the public what it wants . Are the leaders of the indus ? try saying that they are being led around by fools ? . . . If the public wants something that industry scientists know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most serious illnesses , should industry try to sell as much of it as fast as it can ? " Jacobson is not the only critic of the food technolo ? gists . Even its own members are having gut feelings . Prof. George F. Stewart , who won an award from the IFT this year for his " pre-eminence in and contribu ? tions to the field of food technology " told a reporter at the 1973 convention in Miami Beach that he was de ? pressed by the bizarre sights among the exhibit booths . " I worry about it . I think it 's awful . I do n't know where it 's taking us . There 's a lot of stuff being put on the market that 's not food . " Some critics , aware of the Department of Agriculture 's estimate that only 50 percent of American family diets are good ? down 10 percent from the previous decade are beginning to see the irony of a nation surrounded by food but look ? ing for ways , says Dr. D. Mark Hegsted of Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hegsted , speaking recently before a group of food editors in Dallas , felt that " 30 percent of the products in grocery stores today could be thrown out and no ? body would be the worse . " Nobody but the technologists , that is . Of the 356 papers presented at the IFT convention in New Orleans , not one came from an independent consumer or representative of a consumer group , even though such groups ? stomach defense leagues ? now thrive in all areas of the country ; only a few papers touched on issues of food safety or nutrition . Instead of con ? sumers being present , the papers were given either by food company technologists , university professors ? many of them getting consultant money from industry ? or governmental officials from agencies like the FDA or USDA . In 1969 the House intergovernmental relations subcommittee disclosed that of 49 upper level FDA officials who had lately resigned or retired , 37 joined or served as consultants to companies they had just been regulating . The special alarm of the fake food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to display their newest samples of worthlessness but that the technologists appear to work in isolation from the real world . The same week the Institute of Food Tech ? nologists was meeting , food news pressed in . Canada banned all beef from the US because our meat is chernicalized. with DES . In Washington the Consumer Protection Agency bill was being opposed by such powers as the Grocery Manufacturers of America and the National Association of Food Chains . Another bill , seeking to remedy the 40 percent of all US food plants found to be filthy , was also opposed by parts of the food industry . At the FDA a petition was rejected - calling for warning labels on packaged foods that do not list all ingredients ? a measure designed to alert millions of citizens with allergies , high cholesterol levels , dietary problems and certain religious beliefs as to what 's in it for them . Instead of offering leadeithip that might help solve such problems , the technologists mostly inhale the ether of their own cleverness , in a trance over such new products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate . It is as if they take seriously what Mark Twain said , that the " secret success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside . " But that statement came along before the IFT was monkeying with the food supply . Evidence suggests that the food is indeed fighting it out inside of us , except that what is being defeated in internal battles is not other foods but the eater 's blood , muscles and bones . We are beginning to learn that diet and disease are more closely related than previously recognized . Oc ? casionally dramatic examples come forth , such as the astonishing physical fitness of the two Japanese soldiers who recently emerged from jungle hiding since 1945 . Both had perfect teeth , testimony not only to their sugarless diets but also that dental health is entirely possible without Crest or Listerine . The health lesson of the soldiers was an old one : disease is best avoided by a sound diet that can resist bacterial invasion rather than by depending on drugs after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? gests , but has yet to prove , that fatty and refined foods have helped make cancer of the colon and rectum the second most common cancer ? all of us are part of the food scientists ' control group . One of these years , bored by creating new foods , they will go to their annual meeting and announce a new disease , saying " last year you could n't die from this . " An exhibit booth , perhaps between the fake meatballs and the imitation watermelon flavorings , will display a corpse ? floating in chemicals from Stouffers , embalmed with Cool Whip , and ITT Wonder Bread stuffed in its mouth to prevent the hollow look .
