txt Every now and again amid the welter of Mideast recrimination , retaliation , and debate it is possible to discern a turning point . Such a point appears to have been reached here over the past 10 days . It flowed from the new Syrian-orchestrated Arab strategy . This thrust the Mideast issue into the Security Council while making the status of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) the Arabs ' first and essential priority in negotiations . In the 15-member Security Council the Arabs , together with their nonaligned and communist allies , can make much of the running . There , too , they can exercise well-publicized pressure on the United States , underlining paradoxically both Washington 's virtual identity of views with Israel as well as any emerging differences between the two . In these highly charged circumstances the Syrian success in getting the Security Council Sunday night to schedule a Mideast debate in January including ( despite U.S. protestations ) the PLO , has some " real " as opposed to merely rhetorical effects : 1 , To upgrade the PLO 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year with the General Assembly appearance of its leader Yasser Arafat . 2 , To add to the pressure on the Israeli Government to move a little nearer some way of dealing with the PLO lest it lose its firm foothold in Washington . 3 . To draw attention to the American administration 's delicate , cautious , long-term efforts to resolve the PLO impasse . American officials warn against over-interpreting recent events . The American aim // * Turning point in UN debate on Mideast // is to ride out the current General Assembly session and to get to grips with the problems of Middle East negotiations in the calmer days thereafter . In particular , the Americans utterly reject the Security Council as a forum for negotiations . " We 're determined not to let the peace talks into the Security Council . It 's no place to negotiate , " said one U.S. diplomat . The real turning point , in this view , would come when there was a change of attitude in either the Israeli Government or the PLO or both . Meanwhile , the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the governments concerned , not including the PLO . The whole process of confrontation over the PLO in the Security Council was accelerated this week by the Israeli air strikes against targets in Lebanon . " How they the Israelis could have put in an air strike now beats me , " exclaimed one Western diplomat . " It could hardly have been worse timed . " Egypt , anxious to regain the diplomatic initiative from Syria , quickly demanded PLO participation in the Security Council meeting called for by Lebanon . At time of writing it seemed likely that the PLO would be invited to appear before the council at a meeting later on Thursday afternoon . Being a procedural matter , no veto is possible and nine votes in favor decide the question . The Israeli ambassador to the U.S. , Simcha Dinitz , indicated in Washington Thursday that Israel would boycott any council debate in which the PLO participated . Even in the General Assembly debate , which has been proceeding in tandem with the Security Council maneuverings , the thrust has been toward getting the Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution , clearly inspired by the Arabs , requests that the Security Council implement " all relevant resolutions " aimed at a comprehensive settlement " including the Palestine Liberation Organization .
