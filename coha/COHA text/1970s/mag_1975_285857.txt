They needed a scuba-diving midget . Exactly why was a secret . " We wanted to keep that , " says Director Steven Spielberg , " for the sapper . " <P> The casting call specified that the midget ought also to have had some experience doing stunt work . At his office in Universal Studios , Spielberg interviewed anyone with this curious combination of credentials . Then Carl Rizzo walked in . <P> At 4 ft. 11 in. , Rizzo is not a full-fledged midget . But he did have stunt experience . And when he arrived in the office , his face was covered with blood . He explained that rushing to the interview , he had got into a car accident outside the studio gate . Rizzo got the job in Jaws on the spot . <P> He was dispatched to the township of Port Lincoln , 170 miles west of Adelaide , Australia . From there he was to sail 20 miles out into the gulf in company of Underwater Photographers Ron and Valerie Taylor and be lowered over the side of a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doubling for one of the film 's leading actors , was simply to persevere while a great white shark tried to trash him . <P> Since the real shark is about 16 ft. long , and the fictional great white in Jaws no less than 24 , Rizzo 's diminutive height would make the real fish look bigger . Rizzo understood all this . He did not count , however , on the fervor of the great white . Beginning his first descent , he watched one shark attack the Taylors ' boat . Vexed , it sideswiped Rizzo , ripped his cage from its cable and took it to the bottom . Carl shot out of the water and headed for cover . <P> His dilemma and his eminently rational response would win anyone 's sympathy . But this summer , movie audiences may find themselves sharing a taste of his terror . Unlike Carl , most spectators will surrender willingly to the sea monster . Unlike Carl , too , most will probably want to see more of its tantrums . <P> Jaws , which opens in 490 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high adventure films and thrillers over the past few months ( see box page 44 ) . It is expensive ( $8 million ) , elaborate , technically intricate and wonderfully crafted , a movie whose every shock is a devastating surprise . Like Earthquake , it takes a panic-producing disaster and shows how a representative cross section of humanity responds to it . Like The Exorcist , it deals with an essentially unknowable , therefore unpredictable and thoroughly spooky symbol of evil . Jaws promises to hit right in the old collective unconscious and to draw millions irresistibly to the box office . Start a mass-medium migration like that , its producers hope , and millions more will turn out just to see what all the excitement is about . After that , as they say in the trade , " through the roof . " <P> What sets Jaws apart from most of the other ceiling busters and makes it a special case , like The Godfather , is that it is quite a good movie . For one thing , it is mercifully free of the padding-cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures . In that sense , the movie is very like its subject . If the great white shark that terrorizes the beaches of an island summer colony is one of nature 's most efficient killing machines , Jaws is an efficient entertainment machine .
