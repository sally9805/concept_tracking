In France , where age will be served , the elderly dominate business . One out of every four French companypresidents is 65 or older . One-third of the board members in France 's 40 largest firms are past 70 . And young executives grouse that their advancement is blocked by stubborn old men . <P> Last week the French government moved to unseat the elders . Under a bill drafted by the Cabinet for submission to the National Assembly - where its passage is practically assured-companies would be given two years to set some kind of mandatory retirement age . In firms failing to comply , all chief executives and other high-ranking managers would be required by law to step down at 65 . Proprietors with controlling interest in their own firms would not be affected . <P> The measure , the first of its kind in a capitalist country , is stirring a howling controversy . Some Frenchmen argue that the bill should also include government leaders . They remain exempt , apparently on the assumption that what is dotage in business is simply seasoning in politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
