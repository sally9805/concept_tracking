txt " Britain will make it this time . " The " it " ? Common Market membership . In London right now , no statement could be more risky . But in Brussels , headquarters of the European Economic Community , this comment now echoes quietly in unattributable , but no-ifs-about-it conversation . One long-time watcher of Common Market growth concedes that although Britain may not feel " in " for some years , the initial formalities of membership , in his judgment , simply ca n't be stopped . France still blusters about special transitional arrangements for British agriculture and industry . Yet even Paris shows some signs of toning down its obstructionism . Political parties and assorted pressure groups in Britain are still very much divided on their nation 's motion toward Europe . In fact , a national referendum today might veto the whole membership idea . But , as of October , 1970 , the signal from the insiders in Brussels is : " green light for the U.K. " before another year passes . e Car ban pays off Glasgow  --  like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? is experimenting with " pedestrianization " ? banning autos during certain hours on downtown streets . Recently Sauchiehall Street , Glasgow 's main boulevard and normally one of Britaint 's busiest thoroughfares , was closed off for eight hours . Pedestrians had it to themselves . Result : Shopkeepers say business boomed . The tryout was staged by traders themselves as part of the Sauchiehall Street Festival . Shop owners assert their business has been badly hit since the street became part of Glasgow 's one-way system , with traffic speeding along it from west to east . " With no vehicular traffic , " says the manager of one store , " we found the increase in customers was tremendous . " Other comments : " Our best day since last year 's Christmas rush " ; " trade up by 15 percent " ; " a bumper day " ; " our coat department finished 75 percent over normal business . " Looks as though people are in. ( 1 ) Hydrocarbon cutback To reduce pollution from cars and trucks , all new vehicles registered in Britain on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted with a device designed to prevent gases escaping into the atmosphere . This move , it is said , could cut hydrocarbon pollution by 25 percent . On the way back up ? For the first time this century , it seems likely Britain will halt and possibly reverse the decline in its share of world shipping . Once British ships carried nearly half the world 's cargo . Its portion today is only 11.5 percent . But British shipowners now have more than 18 million tons of new shipping on order , or 15.5 percent of world orders . And of all the container ships currently being built , 16.3 percent of the tonnage is for British owners . Indeed , contrary to popular belief , the British merchant fleet is the largest and most efficient this country has ever boasted at any time in its history . Of its 2,000 ships , totaling 32 million tons deadweight , one-third are less than five years old . ( 1 ) Two transport plans Much interest has been expressed here in the idea of free public transportation in cities ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not much support . For the proposal has drawbacks . The Greater London Council estimates the program would cost so much it would add 20 percent to everyone 's local property taxes . And even that would not provide for future expansion and improved wages and salaries . A different and perhaps more viable proposition also being mooted is : Sell motorists a special " city tag " or license entitling them to use city streets . Sell these by the week , month , and year . Use one-half this revenue to improve public transport and reduce fares ; the other half to improve and maintain road systems . Recruiting Scots West German industrialists , aware of the unemployment in certain parts of Great Britain , notably Scotland , are trying to attract Scottish craftsmen . Feeling keenly a shortage of skilled labor , Germany particularly needs right now men with skills in shipbuilding and in heavy and light engineering . One company , Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Niirnberg of Munich , which makes diesel engines and other engineering products , already has recruited 60 Scots . A German shipbuilding firm is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steelworkers , and turners.
