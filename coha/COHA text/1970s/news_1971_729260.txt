txt The Supreme Court ruled 8 to I today that persons who wanted divorces but were too poor to pay filing fees and court costs must have those costs borne by the state . On a related poverty question , the Court declared unanimously that poor persons could not be sent to jail solely because they could not pay fines . The Justices suggested that some other method of collecting the fines ? suck as installment paymentsrmust be tried before an indigent person could be jailed for nonpayment . In another decision , the Court ordered a Federal District Court in Tennessee , to review the decision of two Transportation Department officials who approved Federal funds for a road through a city park in Memphis ; Black Dissents Justice Hugo L. Black , the lone dissenter in the divorce case , denounced the decision as one that would use taxpayers ' funds to encourage divorce . He also charged in a heated statement from the - bench that states would next be required to provide free lawyers for the poor in divorce and other civil litigation . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice Harry A. , Blackmun , . whom President Nixon named to the court as " strict constructionists , " stared stonily ahead . " If ever there has been e looser construction of the Constitution in this Court 's history , I fail to think what it is , " the 85-year-old Justice said . The case was brought to the Supreme Court by five Connecticut welfare mothers who had tried to file divorce suits in state court but were turned down because they , could not , afford to pay filing fees and court costs of about $60 a case . Attorneys ' fees were not involved in the case because the women received free legal assistance from the Legal Aid Service . The lawyers asked a threejudge Federal District Court to declare the state procedure unconstitutional . The court refused on the ground that no fundamental constitutional right had been violated . Justice John M. Harlan wrote the Supreme Court 's opinion today as that ruling was reversed . He said that the women 's right to due process of law had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage and divorce , had effectively denied them an opportunity to be heard . Justices William 0 . Douglas and William J. Brennan Jr . said in concurring opinions that the court should have based its opinion on the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment , which has been held to require free trial transcripts for poor people in criminal cases . Domestic relations attorneys could not say today whether the decision was likely to touch off a rush to the courthouse by indigent divorce-seekers across the country . Twenty-one states already have laws that permit judges , if they wish , to let poor people sue for divorce without paying court costs . However , today 's ruling also excuses them from having to pay the costs of notifying absent spouses of the suits through newspaper admen tisements . Justice Brennan wrote the opinion that erased American judges ' traditional power to sentence poor defendants to " $30 or 30 days . " At issue was the case of Preston A. Tate , a Houston laborer and chronic scofflaw who was fined $425 for a series of traffic offenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jail for 35 days to work off the fine at a rate of $5 a day . In Texas , jail sentences are not authorized for such traffic offenses . Thus , the Supreme Court was faced only with the question of whether a poor man can be jailed for failure to pay such a fine , when a wealthy one could never be sent to jail for committinng the same offenses . But Justice Brennan 's opinion went beyond the facts of the . Tate case to declare that poor people could not . he jailed for inability to pay fines , even if they could have been given a jail sentence for their crimes in the first instance . He stressed that persons who could pay fines but refused or neglected to do so could still be jailed . Justices Black and Harlan concurred in the result , without joining in the Brennan opinion . Justice Blackmun said in a brief statement that the ruling may prompt some states to make imprisonment the only punishment for traffic violations . He suegested that in view of the " frightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be at all undesirable . " Arthur B. Lafrance of Tempe , Ariz. , argued for the Connecticut women . Raymond J. Cannon , Assistant Attorney General of Connecticut , argued for the state . Norman Dorsen of New York argued for Mr. Tate . Joseph G. Rollins of the Houston City Attorney 's office argued for the city .
