txt A battle is brewing in California . The outcome could affect the entire 1,100-mile stretch of California coastline . Tne issue is a coastal zone proposal that environmentalists are supporting on the November ballot . It would set strict environmental standards for the whole coastline ? pending adoption of a long-range statewide plan . Opposing the initiative is a so-called non-coastal alliance ? an " umbrella " group for dissenting developers , realtors , oil interests , and building-trades unions among others . They charge the proposal is an infringement on individual property rights and would result in depreciation of home values on the coast and heavy loss of construction jobs . Backers of this measure stress that for four years all significant proposed coastal legislation has failed to muster support from state lawmakers . And this has left California with one of the nation 's longest and most valued coastlines ? with virtually no environmental planning for its shoreline . Commission proposed If passed , the proposal would create a state coastal zone conservation commission  --  and six regional groups to regulate coastline development . Builders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfside projects . And state lawmakers would be mandated to unfurl a broad-based environmental protection plan for the coast by 1976 . But even as the coastal zone proposal was qualifying for the ballot , the antiproposal alliance was girding for the fight against it . The " anti " group promises to wage a well-financed battle . This joint " lobby " admits it has been a most potent factor in defeating coastal legislation here since 1969 . And many of these same member organizations contributed generously to the $2 million war chest used to help beat a more expansive environmental initiative on California 's June primary ballot . In addition to their general reservations , they also warn that commission " screening " of surfside building would likely result in a virtual moratorium on all construction . This , they say , could have an adverse effect on needed power-plant sitings , among other things . Hodgepodge feared Backers , including the Sierra Club and other environmentalists , see no such angers . They say the initiative is now the only remaining potential curb to piecemeal construction ? which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // *California 's coastal issue // They point out that the measure has built-in flexibility . It . can be amended at any time after it becomes law by two-thirds vote of the state Legislature . Also , other coastal states ? on both sides of the U.S. ? have left California in the dust in regard to shoreline planning , they stress . For example , the Oregon Legislature has formed a coastal conservation and development commission . And in the State of Washington , the newly formed State Department of Ecology is working with local agencies to hammer out a coastline protection plan . Washington voters will get a chance to ratify this proposal in November . Coastal planning 7 On the East Coast , Maine 's shoreline zoning act requires local communities to submit coastal plans for 1973 . New Jersey has declared a moratorium on wetlands development . Massachusetts is restricting about 45,000 acres of marshlands for conservation purposes . And Delaware ? with perhaps the nation 's toughest shoreline legislation ? bars oil refineries , steel mills , and chemical plants from the coast and Delaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . The coastal zone management bill ? recently approved by the Senate and now in joint conference committee ? would provide $320 million in grants to states over a five-year period to develop plans and management programs to protect shorelines .
