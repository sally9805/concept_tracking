txt biological processes used by man . Most notable among these are fuel combustion ? for heating , cooking , and industrial processing ? and the genera tion of electricity . The natural ( background ) levels of the naturally occurring gases and then estimated residence times* are given in Table 1.1 The levels above which t best could have an effect on man and the environment have been called " Alt Quality Standards . " The " Primary Standard " is based on information , tlrrttl Formation and Control of Air Pollutants 181 human health , and generally specifies a higher concentration ( usually 25% or more ) than the " Secondary Standard , " which protects the environment : property , materials , climate , economic values , etc . The present Air Quality Standards are two or more orders of magnitude higher than the background levels . 2 . Air Pollutants from Combustion The most common fuels are fossil fuels : oil , coal , and natural gas . In some Icss-developed countries wood is also widely used . The major constituents of coal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen , with lesser amounts of sulfur and nitrogen , as well as traces of other materials such as metal compounds ( sulfides and oxides ) . Natural gas , as pipeline gas , has had the sulfur compounds removed , as they corrode pipelines . The actual quantities of sulfur compounds depend both on the fuel type and on the source . Thus the sulfur content in oil and coal can vary between less than 1% to 5% . In the case of oil , virtually all sulfur is tied into the organic chemical structure ( organic sulfur ) , while for coal about half the sulfur is " organic " and the rest is " inorganic , " distributed as fine crystals of pyrites ( FeS2 ) , ferric sulfate ( Fe2(SO4)3 ) , magnesium sulfate ( Mg504 ) , calcium sulfate ( CaSO4 ) , and other compounds . During combustion , the hydrogen and carbon compounds are oxidized , with the evolution of energy:2 C+ 02  --   --  CO2 + 94.0 kcal/mol ( kg mol ) ( 395 MJ/mol ) H2+Z02 -0 H2O+68.3 kcal/mol ( 287 MJ/mol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carbon , some of the carbon dioxide formed may react , to give the monoxide C+CO2 ? - 2CO ? 410 kcal/mol ( 172 MJ/mol ) or some of the carbon may react with less oxygen : C+ZO2 -5 CO+ 26.4 kcal/mol ( 111 MJ/mol ) ' Phis shows that when combustion occurs with insufficient oxygen , much carbon monoxide is produced , and the overall heat release is far less than when complete combustion is achieved . During incomplete combustion of oil or coal , volatile organic compounds that are complex hydrocarbons can be driven off , and these form one compotic nt of smoke , particularly from small domestic furnaces . In larger furnaces the ' olatilcs , which are highly combustible , are ignited by radiation and convection t un t he hot walls of the furnace , and are burned to carbon dioxide and water . ' I'he minor constituents of the coal and oil , sulfur and nitrogen , also form osidcs during combustion . For sulfur S + 0 ,  --   --  S02 182 Chapter 7 and to a lesser extent in the flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MJ In fact , in the normal flame SO3 only represents about 1% of the total sulfur oxides . Although SO3 is the stable form at lower temperatures , the rate of formation , without a catalyst present , is so slow as to be insignificant , while at flame temperatures , the dioxide is more stable . Nitric oxide ( NO ) is also formed during combustion . In part this is from nitrogen in the fuel , of which , according to different experimenters , between 18% and 80% is oxidized ; the rest is due to reactions with atmospheric nitrogen in the flame and post-flame regions . The following reactions , referred to as the Zeldovich reactions , are considered primarily responsible N2+O* ? NO+N* ? 75 kcal/mol ( 315 MJ/mol ) N*+02 ?

These , simplified , are NO + ; 02  --  I ' NO2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of forming active nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the flame , as well as hydroxyl radicals , OH* , which can react very quickly N* +OH* ? NO+H*+39.4 kcal/mol ( 165 MJ/mol ) In the case of gas firing , or firing with sulfur-free ( and nitrogen-free ) oils , no sulfur oxides occur in the combustion gases , and the nitrogen oxides are solely from the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen . The amounts produced vary over a wide spectrum ( see Table 2 ) . But while the sulfur oxides are wholly a function of the sulfur in the fuel , the nitrogen oxides depend largely on the method of firing and the resultant flame temperature . Particulate emission from combustion , i.e. , smoke , is a function of the solid incombustible materials in the fuel and of incomplete combustion of the carbon . Particularly with small industrial , commercial , or domestic boilers and furnaces , when these are overloaded , or burning at very low levels , both unburned carbon particles and inorganic matter are emitted . There is generally very little smoke from oil- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-adjusted burners . However , coal-fired units invariably produce some smoke , especially when fired with pulverized fuel , as in modern , large-scale operating practice , and some system of particulate control is essential . In older coal-fired systems , where the coal was burned on grates , it was possible to minimize emissions since much of the ash would fall down into the ash pit and was not entrained in the flue gases passing to the chimney . Formation and Control of Air Pollutants 183 For stationary combustion systems , where firing takes place in a chamber , and in which there is a stable flame and an appreciable residence time for the oxidation reactions to take place , the air pollutants are the oxides of sulfur and nitrogen , and particulate matter . The use of controls is usual practice for particulate matter and to a limited extent for the oxides of sulfur and nitrogen . This is in contrast with " internal combustion " systems used almost invari-ably for automobiles ? In these , a charge of fuel is burned in a chamber with cooled walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a connecting rod , crank , and drive shaft . The time for combustion is limited to a fraction of a second , and the cooled walls prevent complete combustion of the charge . Unburned and incompletely burned combustion products are then emitted . There are two principal types of internal combustion systems : the spark-ignition ( or Otto ) engine , which is the usual automobile power unit , and the compression ignition ( or Diesel ) engine . The cycles in these engines , and the methods of controlling the emissions , will be dealt with fully in Chapter 8 . It should be stated here however that in addition to the oxides of nitrogen , internal combustion engines produce considerable quantities of unburned " active " hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide ( Table 3 ) . All combustion processes using carbonaceous fuels produce carbon diox-ide , which until recently was not considered an air pollutant per se . It was considered that the carbon dioxide from combustion was used and recycled by plants during photosynthesis . Measurements of carbon dioxide levels over the past century have shown a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the atmosphere at remote locations ; in fact , this rise corres-ponds to about half the carbon dioxide produced by combustion of 2 fossil fuels . This problem and its possible consequences will be discussed fully in Chapter 10. 184 Chapter 7 3 . Air Pollutantssfrom Industry Apart from combustion systems for generating heat or electricity , or providing motive power , the major sources of air pollutants are processes in the chemical , metallurgical , and petroleum industries . Thus a major , and often quite concentrated source of sulfur dioxide is the roasting of nonferrous sulfide minerals , principally lead , zinc , and copper ores . The petroleum industry , directly and indirectly , is responsible for hydrocarbon and sulfur oxide emis-sions , and the chemical industry for a wide range of air pollutants , usually specific to the processes in which they are formed . 3.1 . The Nonferrous Metallurgical Industry A most important source of sulfur dioxide emissions , second only in total quantity to the sulfur dioxide from combustion of fuels , and representing over 10% of this , is the roasting and subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and zinc . This industry has sources which produce concentrations often of the order of 4 ? 10% which are sufficiently high to be converted to the trioxide and to sulfuric acid with conventional catalysts . Unfortunately , many of the world 's primary treatment plants for nonferrous ores are far from places where there is a demand for the sulfuric acid for fertilizers or chemical processing . It has been pointed out , for example , that Australia , which imports large quantities of sulfur for fertilizer for its agricultural industry , would be self-sufficient if it used all the sulfur produced by metallurgical processing.4 Another factor resulting from these high concentrations is that considera-ble damage to vegetation has been caused by the waste gases from smelters , particularly copper smelters . The initial destruction of plants , followed by soil Formation and Control of Air Pollutants 185 erosion , has given rise to the classical barren landscapes of Ducktown , Tennes- ; Queenstown , Tasmania ; and elsewhere , where copper and other nonferr-smelters have been allowed to operate without controls . In conventional copper smelting ( Fig. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove some of the sulfur , which is emitted in concentrations of about 8% . The resultant calcine , a mixture of the sulfides and oxides of copper and iron , is fed to a reverberatory furnace , together with limestone and/or silica as fluxes . This combines with metal oxides and other impurities to float on top of a layer of copper and iron sulfides , which is tapped off to form the " matte . " The waste 186 gases from this process contain only 1-2% sulfur dioxide , and so require special treatment if SO2 is to be removed . The matte is subsequently heated in a converter , where the iron is oxidized , along with the remaining sulfur , to suit ti : dioxide , which comes off in concentrations of about 3-5% . The problem of S ( ) , recovery in this case is the batch nature of the conventional process , although a continuous process , such as the WORCRA process , would help to give a steady supply suitable for acid manufacture . Lead and zinc are generally obtained from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZnS ) . Usually , as in the case of ores from Broken fill . Australia , they are found together . The ores are roasted , either on a moving grate or in a fluidized bed roaster , and the waste gases , containing sulfur dioxide in concentrations of about 6% , are used , when possible , for the manufacture of acid . The major problems in this case are that the roaster off-gases contain impurities such as arsenic trioxide ( As203 ) , hydrochloric acid gas , hydrogen fluoride , and similar compounds , which are volatilized from the ore and are catalyst poisons . They would prevent the catalytic oxidation stage from operating satisfactorily , and so must be removed , together with other particulate impurities in the gas stream . 3.2 . Ferrous Metallurgy Iron ore , which is generally quite pure ferric oxide ( hematite ) is essentially reduced with carbon , to give iron . In practice , the reduction is carried out on a very large scale in blast furnaces . In modern plants , the ore and carbon are introduced into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ore and carbon ( as coke ) separately . The product is still relatively impure iron , containing some 6% carbon . This can now be used , together with some scrap iron , for cast iron products , or it can be further treated to give steel in one of a number of processes such as the " basic oxygen converter , " the open hearth furnace , or the electric furnace . In each case , ' scrap metal forms an appreciable part of the charge . The final product , which now contains much less carbon , also has small traces of substances ? alloying elements ? which impart very specific properties to the steel , such as hardness , tensile strength , corrosion resistance , etc . There are many sources of air pollution in the iron and steel industry , originating from the large-scale handling and high-temperature processing which is involved . The mining and handling of the ore is a serious control problem , as is the dust produced during the sintering of coal and ore before it passes into the blast furnace . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the high carbon monoxide content of the " waste " gases makes them a valuable fuel for other steel works operations , and so it is carefully collected , cleaned , and used . The steel making is carried out in converters , in reverberatory furnaces , or in electric furnaces . Frequently , and particularly in modern converter practice , pure oxygen is used to speed up the reactions , and this is accompanied by a tremendous evolution of very fine orange brown fume which must be Formation and Control of Air Pollutants 187 INmttoIlcd . These converter gases also have a high , although intermittent , p-limn monoxide content which in the most modern plants is collected for $ub.ecluent use . Coke ovens are a further serious pollution source because of the dust used in filling the ovens , the evolution of steam and fine particles in coke quenching , and the gases emitted through leaks in the ovens , which can contain iullIdes and mercaptans and produce an odor problem associated with coke oven batteries . .3 . Nonmetallic Minerals Materials such as cement , glass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for concrete and road surfacing , and coal are mined and quarried in ery large quantities . Many of the materials have a low unit value , and so must be produced relatively close to the point of consumption , as with , for example , sand and aggregate . With the exception of some underground coal mining , most of the materials are quarried , which in the case of coal means " open-cut " mining . The material is usually blasted , crushed , and transported to storage bins , from which it is carried in trucks to the point of use . Coal may receive additional treatment that separates out noncoal constituents by washing . Cement and glass are obtained by chemical treatment mainly of limestone and sand , respectively ( as well as other materials ) . In cement manufacturing , the crushed limestone , after blending , is calcined in rotary kilns , with emission of considerable amounts of fine dust , chiefly lime dust . In glass manufacturing , the sand and crushed broken ( used ) glass is melted down in a furnace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , carbonates , nitrates , chlorides , and fluorides , all of which present a specific air pollution source . In all of these industries the mining , crushing , transport , and storage of the materials is associated with the generation of large amounts of dust , both coarse and relatively fine . As the dusts contain silica , and in some instances , asbestos , they present a danger to workers in these industries , and considerable " in-plant " efforts are made to control them for purposes of industrial hygiene . However , careless plant operation and transport can cause dust problems elsewhere . 3.4 . Petroleum Refining The refining and subsequent treatment of crude petroleum gives a vast variety of product hydrocarbons , from jet fuel and motor oil to furnace oils and bitumen , including the raw materials for the petrochemical industry . Essentially , crude petroleum is distilled , and the different fractions are either used directly or are treated chemically , breaking down and reforming the molecules to give the products in the quantities and proportions required by consumers . The great changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on simple distillation and an increase in the degree of chemical 188 Chapter 7 treatments , both of which reduce , to a large extent , the dependence 1 ) I the refiner on the source and constitution of his crude . Crude petroleum contains hydrocarbons , together with organic sulfur compounds , inorganic compounds ( iron , vanadium , etc. ) , and some alkali and alkali earths , etc. , which form ash . However , ash in oils is low ? of the order of 0.1% or less ? compared with 1% or more as is common in coal . Sulfur content in oils varies from 0.5% ( or less ) in Indonesian or Bass Strait crudes to 4% ( or more ) in some Middle Eastern and Mexican crudes . The following are the main sources of air pollution in a refinery . First , the pollutants from combustion gases : a refinery tends to use the lowest grade , high-sulfur fuels in its own furnaces and boilers . Second , there are fine particles from badly operated " flares , " used to cope with sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions from the catalytic cracking , and particularly the catalyst recovery unit . These are usually fluidized bed reactors , and as the catalyst particles are reduced in size by constant cycling , they are blown out of the catalyst fluidized beds . Fourth , there are many sources of hydrogen sulfides and mercaptans , which are stripped from the lighter grades of fuel ( motor oil , kerosene , light diesel oil , etc. ) since they would corrode the engines in which they are used . In good refinery practice these are collected and sulfur is recovered . Finally , in a refinery there are many sources of hydrocarbon emissions from leaks in valves and pipelines , in reactors , and in storage tanks . In correctly operated refineries these are reduced to a minimum , and the unavoidable emissions are recovered and used , since they are valuable . 3.5 . Chemical Process Industries The chemical process industries ( of which petroleum refining is of course a major part ) produce such a wide variety of chemicals from such a wide range of raw materials , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail . However , some of the major air pollutants can be considered and their sources indicated . Sulfur dioxide is emitted by plants manufacturing sulfuric acid , as the catalytic conversion of the sulfur dioxide to the trioxide is incomplete at the temperatures commonly used in the reactors ( 450-600 ? C ) . Conventional practice ( which uses three catalyst passes , followed by trioxide absorption ) uses about 98% of the sulfur dioxide , emitting the remainder . With small plants , producing on the order of 200 tons of acid each day , the emissions could be tolerated , but some modern acid plants are ten times larger . Here , an " interpass absorption " stage has been introduced , reducing the emissions to about 0.2% and increasing the acid yield . Some hydrogen fluoride and other fluorides are emitted from " superphosphate " fertilizer manufacture , when sulfuric acid is reacted with crushed phosphate rock . Other sources of fluoride are from electrolytic smelting of aluminum , where the " flux " used is cryolite , an aluminum sodium fluoride. // Flouride emissions have also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluoride in the day used for brick making . Ammonia and oxides of nitrogen are emitted in some chemical processes using ammonia or nitric acid as reagents or catalysts . Hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans , besides being emitted by hydrocarbon processors , arc also emitted in the paper or cellulose pulp industry . Wood , after debarking and chipping , is treated in reactors with either neutral ( neutral sulfite pulping ) or alkaline ( " Kraft " pulping ) reagents . In the former case , which is the most common , the reagent is a bicarbonate-buffered solution of sodium sulfite , while in Kraft pulping it is a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide . Alter reacting with the lignin in the wood , the sulfur forms complex mercaptans , and hydrogen sulfide with low odor threshold forms part of the " black liquor , " which is filtered off the pulp . Most of the odors are emitted when the " black liquor " is concentrated and then burnt in special recovery furnaces . Another air pollution source in the wood and paper industry is associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hydrocarbon vapors are produced in the paint industry , first during paint manufacture in cooking the resins , and to a lesser extent in the mixing of the paint . Large total quantities of hydrocarbons , although low in individual concentrations , are given off from paints when applied to surfaces . When used in enclosed spaces these can occasionally cause headache and nausea . More serious is the problem of hydrocarbon vapors , which may be partly " cracked " from the baking of enameled surfaces , such as car bodies , tinplate , etc. 3.6 . Food and Foodstuffs Processing Odors are the main air pollution problem in the food and related industries . In many cases the odors from some types of food processing , e.g. , bread baking and coffee roasting , are very pleasant , as long as the concentrations are low and last only for limited periods . But large-scale processing of these and other foodstuffs produces odors in such concentrations and for such extended periods as to be extremely nauseous . The odors are complex chemical mixtures of aldehydes and related compounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , not for edible foods , also causes serious odor problems . Essential oils have their characteristic odors which are nauseous in large concentrations . The processing of animal residues , an important source of protein feed for poultry , and of edible or inedible fats ( depending on the source of the residues ) , using medium-pressure steam distillation ( rendering ) , produces particularly nauseous odors which are mainly ethylamines . More complaints are received by air pollution control authorities about odors than about any other form of air pollution . While odors are rarely dangerous or toxic , in the usually accepted sense , they can cause headaches , nausea , and disturbing psychological effects . Chapter 7 3.7 . Incineration of Wastes Small-scale incineration of garbage , garden cuttings , and leaves result its serious smoke pollution and acrid odors when carried out by a multiplicity of sources . Some industrial incineration , such as the burning of old tires or of the covering from electrical cables to recover the metal values , has similar results . In many places this is now prohibited . Large-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units , has relatively few problems of this sort , since complete combustion is achieved and effective particulate collection systems are installed . However , a certain proportion of current domestic wastes consists of polyvinylchloridc ( PVC ) which on combustion releases hydrochloric acid gas , and this can he a serious problem . 4 . Control of Air Pollutants ( General ) Air pollutants are generally produced in dilute concentrations , together with large volumes of a carrier gas . One way of controlling air pollutants is to remove the source , either by changing the process or by stopping the process altogether . Examples of these measures are numerous , and can involve electri-cal generation by nuclear-fueled reactors instead of coal-fired boilers ( see also Chapter 13 ) , electric cars instead of internal combustion engine vehicles , or the alteration of a mineral extraction process from ore roasting to alkaline leach-ing . Complete elimination of a process may in some cases be necessary , although if the product is essential and there is no substitute ( either process or product ) , then the process may have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate control system and with supplementary precautions . It may be noted that the decision to use a cleaner , more complex , more sophisticated , and more costly basic process can be encouraged by the enforcement of stricter pollution controls . The application of " add-on " controls may be more costly and difficult for conventional processing technology than changing to the new technology . The control of air pollutants from industry and electric power generation will be discussed here , while the control of emissions from automotive internal combustion engines will be considered in Chapter 8 . Nonetheless , the different processes that are combined for internal combustion engine controls are merely special applications of industrial control technology . Gaseous and particulate air pollutants can be considered as two stages in the size spectrum of airborne material : gaseous pollutants are molecular in scale , and particulates range from about 0.05 p , to 100 p .. * For control of gases , only the diffusion of molecules into a " control region " can be used , while particles can be removed from a gas stream by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and electrostatic or thermal attraction , as well as Brownian diffusion of the particles . For particles larger than about 1 ? Brownian diffusion becomes a mechanism of negligible importance . Formation and Control of Air Pollutants 191 5 . Control of Gaseous Pollutants For gaseous air pollutants to he removed from a carrier gas , they must diffuse to a region or surface . At a solid surface they can be retained or , if the surface is catalytic , changed to a nonpolluting species .. At a liquid interface pollutant molecules can be absorbed and carried away , while in a " control region , " such as a flame , pollutant molecules can react homogeneously and be transformed into other molecules which are not air pollutants in the accepted sense . In more specific terms , control of gaseous pollutants consists of either liquid absorption , an adsorption on an inert catalyst surface , or flame combustion . All these are used in industrial air pollution control systems in different applications . Gas absorption is a standard chemical engineering unit operation , which can be carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions , or co-currently , with both fluids flowing in the same direction . When dealing with relatively high concentrations of pollutant gases ( of the order of one percent or more ) , then countercurrent flow is the common practice , since a reasonable concentration difference , resulting in an optimum " driving " force , occurs throughout the whole system , the lowest gas stream concentration contacting the " weakest " liquid concentration ( referring to the dilute concentration of gas in the liquid ( Fig. 2 ) ) . However , in the removal of pollutant gases already in relatively low concentration in the carrier gas , co-current scrubbers , with special design features giving large contact surfaces for short contact times , are often used . These contactors may be spray scrubbers in which the liquid is dispersed in the gas , or vice versa , intimate contact being achieved by having small bubbles of gas in the liquid or small droplets of absorbing liquid in the gas . The rate of transfer ( mass transfer ) of the pollutant gas ( NA ) to the absorbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbent ( A ) , the driving force Ow ) , and the " mass transfer " coefficient ( kG ) NA=kGAOc The surface area depends on the amount of scrubbing liquid per unit volume of gas , droplet size ( for spray units ) , surface area of packings ( for packed towers ) , and other factors concerned with the physical characteristics of the absorber ; the driving force is the concentration difference ( Ac ) between the pollutant gas in the gas stream and at the surface of the liquid , while the mass transfer coefficient is a function of the diffusion of the gas molecules , the thickness of the " boundary " layer , the concentration difference , and the temperature and pressure of the system . These parameters can be determined experimentally or calculated , and the methods of sizing and designing suitable gas absorption units can be found in chemical engineering textbooks concerned with industrial gas cleaning , gas absorption , or more generally , with mass transfer processes ( e.g. , see Kohl and 192 Chapter 7 Riesenfeld ) . It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer coefficients and an accurate knowledge of system behavior are essential if precise and realistic designs are to be developed . In general , gaseous pollutants present in concentrations down to 0.1% ( by volume ) , i.e. , 1000 ppm , are effectively handled by liquid scrubbing systems . These include hydrogen sulfide , sulfur dioxide , ammonia , nitrogen oxides , and others , particularly hydrocarbons . The gases can often be recovered , possibly Formation and Control of Air Pollutants 193 by steam distillation ( " stripping " ) and the absorbing liquid recycled . The processes prove economically viable under some conditions , and will be discussed in some detail for specific pollutant gases . The processes involved in adsorption of a gas on a solid are fundamentally similar to their absorption in a liquid , as the molecules diffuse across a boundary layer to the solid ? gas interface . At the solid surface , however , the molecules are retained , and in time build up a concentration such that the concentration difference diffusion driving force is lost , and only an interchange of molecules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes place . The surface available for adsorption may , of course , be very large ; in the case of some materials such as the diatomaceous earths or activated carbon , they amount to several square meters per gram for the former , to many hundreds of square meters per gram for the latter . If the air pollutant is not present in large concentrations , as is the case with odor molecules , it may take a long time ? many months ? before the adsorbent surface is occupied , and the surface must be replaced because it becomes no longer effective . If the surface is that of a catalyst , the pollutant molecules will settle on its " active sites " for a period , undergo a reaction , and then leave , the site being free for further reactions . After a time , of course , the catalyst loses activity ( becomes " poisoned " ) and has to be replaced and possibly reactivated . Catalyst poisons are substances which rapidly deactivate catalysts . Some solid adsorbents are replaced continuously , in a countercurrent ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematic recovery of the " pollutant " gas . Such processes are used for sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide recovery . When molecules are small and polar , as in water vapor , ammonia , or sulfur dioxide , a polar surface adsorbent such as diatomaceous earth or silica gel is suitable , while larger , nonpolar molecules , such as organic vapors ( including odor molecules ) are best adsorbed on a nonpolar surface such as activated carbon . However , activated carbons can be specially made and treated so that they attract some polar molecules ( such as sulfur dioxide ) , and they also have the advantage over polar surface adsorbents of a much greater surface area . Homogeneous gas reactions can also be used for control of some gaseous pollutants , and in particular for hydrocarbons and organic substances containing oxygen and nitrogen . The common reaction used is of course combustion , where the molecules are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water , with possibly some small quantities of nitrogen oxides . Sulfur and chlorine containing organic materials are not usually treated by combustion because sulfur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When using flame combustion it is important that the gases be completely oxidized to CO2 and H2O and not to some intermediate organic molecules which could remain a pollution ( and possibly an odor ) problem . This requires the gases to be retained in the combustion chamber for a reasonable time ? 0.3 ? 0.5 sec ? at the flame temperature . As the whole gas stream has to be heated , the intrinsic calorific value of the pollutant gas is of great importance , since supplementary heat would otherwise have to be provided . Provision of 194 Chapter 7 heat exchangers can help reduce the additional heat input , but adds to the cost and size of the equipment . If the intrinsic calorific value of the pollutant gas is such that the reaction is self-supporting , then the heat output can be used for process or space heating . Catalytic combustion is the use of a heterogeneous catalyst which can reduce the reaction temperature for oxidation from about S00 ? C to 300-400 ? C. The catalysts usually used are active materials ( frequently metals of the platinum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon ) support , or a metal oxide ( alumina ) support , or active metal oxides , usually copper or manganese oxides. 6 . Controls for Specific Gaseous Air Pollutants 6.1 . Sulfur Dioxide Sulfur dioxide , from smelters or from combustion of fossil fuels , is not easily soluble in water , and it is necessary to use alkaline solutions or alkaline solids . Many processes have been suggested , and they can be classified into those that use a cheap reagent which , along with the adsorbed and reacted sulfur dioxide , is subsequently thrown away , and those that use an expensive reagent which can be recovered , in the latter ; the sulfur is also recovered and then used for making either pure sulfur dioxide , sulfuric acid , sulfur , or , if ammonia is used , ammonium sulfate . Limestone ( CaCO3 ) , lime ( CaO ) , or dolomite ( CaCO3 ? MgCO3 ) has been added to the gases in the combustion chamber , and the sulfate formed ( e.g. , Still , Wickert , Jiingten and Peters , Combustion Engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dry sulfate powder can then be taken out by particle recovery , or can be washed out in a scrubber . Removal efficiencies of 40-70% have been achieved with dry recovery , and over 90% with wet collection . The alternative is using lime or magnesium oxide slurries , the latter producing sulfite ( e.g. , Mitsubishi , Bahco , Chemico , Combustion Engineering , Nippon Kokan , Research Cot-trell ) MgO+SO2 ? - MgSO3 which led to a considerable number of plants used on a large scale in the United States and Japan . Most , however , suffer from mechanical difficulties . A modification which has led to several successful commercial applications is the " double alkali " process , where a more active alkali , such as ammonia solution , is used to remove the sulfur dioxide , and this is then recovered by using a second alkali , lime , to produce the sulfate CaSO4 either for sale or disposal , and the active alkali , for reuse ( e.g. , Monsanto Calsox , Envirotech , EDP-Kuhlman , General Motors , etc . ) . Ammonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively 1tr-th SO , at 150 ?

( NH4 ) 2SO5+ 2NaOH  --  - Na2SO3 + 2NH3 + 2H20 NH4HSO5+ NaOH ? NaHSO3 + NH3 + H2O Such a process may be well over 95% effective in removing sulfur dioxide . Water itself , while a poor adsorbent for sulfur dioxide , can be used . in combination with a catalyst of active carbon . Here oxidation takes place on the moist catalyst surface , and dilute ( 10-15% ) sulfuric acid is produced 196 Chapter 7 Manganese oxide is also a good adsorbent , and this is being used in several pilot plants ( e.g. , Mitsubishi , Grillo-/CGS ) , as are sodium sulfite ( e.g. , Wellman-Lord ) , sodium citrate ( e.g. , USBM ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes is of course the direct oxidation of S02 to S ( , SO2+202 -3 SO3 This , the standard catalytic oxidation in sulfuric acid manufacturing , is generally carried out at 450 ? 600 ? C where the conversion is satisfactory and the rate fast , and is self-supporting if the gases are at 450 ? C , the reaction temperature . Low concentrations ? on the order of 0.1 ? 0.4% ? common in flue gases require special catalysts , which have recently been developed ( e.g. , Monsanto Catox ) . At lower temperatures , certain activated carbons are also suitable for the oxidation ( e.g. , Hitashi , Westvaco , Reinluft , Strauss ) and sulfur dioxide can be recovered for subsequent use in an acid plant . Chemically interesting is the process where , after absorption by ammonia , sulfur as well as ammonium sulfate is recovered from an ammonium hydrogen sulfate and thiosulfate solution by a disproportionation reaction carried out in a high-pressure autoclave ( e.g. , Fulham ? Simon ? Carves ) 2NH4HSO3+ ( NH4 ) S2O3 ? - 2(NH4)25O4+2S+H2O ( 170 ? C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used commercially . A mixture of molten alkali carbonates is also being used for SO2 recovery ( e.g. , Atomics International ) , ' the mixture being 32% Li2CO3i 33% Na2CO3 , and 35% K2CO3 ( by weight ) . These give a eutectic mixture , melting at 397 ? C , which appears at 450 ? C as a clear liquid , with a viscosity about ten times that of water at ambient temperatures ( 9.82 cp ) . The density at 450 ? C is 2120 kg/m and surface tension is 236.9 dyn/cm . If the alkali atoms are written as M , the absorption stage is SO2 + M2CO3  --  - M2SO3 + CO2 The sulfite can oxidize M2SO3+202 M2SO4 After absorption , the sulfate and sulfite are reduced , using carbon ( in the form of petroleum coke ) at 800 ? C 2M2SO3+3C  --  2M2S+3CO2 M2SO4+2C -+ M2S+2CO2 Some sulfate and sulfide can also arise from the reaction , and is known to be important at 800 ? C in the reducer 4M2SO3 M2S+3M2SO4 The carbon dioxide is used to regenerate the carbonate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + CO2 + H2O  --  M2CO3 + H2S 197 The hydrogen sulfide produced is in turn oxidized to sulfur , over a catalyst , in a Claus plant H2S+O ? - S+H20 Difficulties with this process are the highly corrosive molten carbonates which have to be handled at high temperatures . Special stainless steels are used at the lower temperatures , where a protective'LiCrO2 film forms , and at the very high temperatures ( to 900 ? C ) the materials of construction are high-density alumina . The lithium carbonate is a relatively expensive material , and consid-erable care must be taken to reduce losses and recover the lithium from process wastes ( Fig. 4 ) . 6.2 . Hydrogen Sulfide Hydrogen sulfide is produced during coal gasification , in biological reac-tions involving sulfur components , and in some chemical reactions . The removal of H2S from coal gas ( and from natural gas ) is important because first , it is highly corrosive and has to be reduced to extremely low concentrations if it Chapter 7 is to be transmitted by pipeline , and second , when these gases are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is chemically easier to take 1 I , S out of the gas stream before combustion ( and dilution with air ) than it Is afterward , as SO2 . The efficiency of removal is also much higher ; while it is possible to reduce SO2 in waste gases to 500 ppm , with effective ( 90% ) treatment processes , hydrogen sulfide can be easily reduced to 1 ? 5 ppm , which results in less than 1 ppm SO2 after combustion . Coal gas also contains some ammonia ( about 1% ) , but treatment proces-ses involving the coal gas ammonia alone remove less than half the H2S present . However , with additional ammonia , hydrogen sulfide can be effectively removed ( e.g. , Collin process ) . The gases need , however , to be further scrubbed to remove entrained ammonia . The product is usually ammonium sulfate and H2S , which is by this time in sufficiently high concentration to he used for sulfur recovery by the Claus process . As an alternative to ammonia , the ethyl- and methylamines are used in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is recovered after use as an absorbent by steam stripping , and is then recycled ( Girbotol proces-ses ) . The first compound to be used was triethanolamine ( ( C2H4OH ) 3N ) ( TEA ) , but this proved to be difficult to regenerate , and so a 15 ? 20% aqueous solution of monoethanolamine ( MEA ) was brought into use . Its disadvantage is largely that some reagent is lost because a heat-stable compound is formed with carbonyl sulfide ( COS ) , diethanol urea ( CO(NHCH2CH2OH)2 ) . MEA is therefore used for natural gas purification , when virtually no COS impurity is present , while diethanolamine ( DEA ) is used for coal and refinery gases.8 In a number of processes it is possible to obtain sulfur directly in the regeneration stage , using atmospheric oxygen as the oxidizing agent . In the first series ( Thylox , Giammarco-Vetrocoke ) , sodium thioarsenates and complex arsenic compounds are used . The absorption stage is H2S + Na4As2S5O2 ? Na4As2S6O + H2O and regeneration : 2Na4As2S6O + 02 , 2NA4As2S5O + 2S In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thioarsenite is subsequently decomposed using carbon dioxide under pressure . A very widely applied process in recent years uses organic dyestuffs in the critical oxidation ? reduction stages ( Stretford process ) . The hydrogen sulfide ( in concentrations of 10 ? 10,000 ppm ( 1% ) ) is first absorbed in an alkaline solution maintained at pH 8.5 ? 9.5 , and containing sodium carbonate , sodium vanadate , anthraquinone 2:6 , and 2:7 disulfonate ( ADA ) . Rochelle salt ( potassium sodium tartrate ) is added as a sequestering agent to prevent precipitation of the vanadate . The reactions are as follows : absorption : H2S + Na2CO3 ? - NaHS+NaHCO3 sulfur production : 2NaHS+H2S+4NaVO3 ? - Na2V4O9+4NaOH+2S formation and Control of Air Pollutants recovery of vanadate : Na , V. , O1 , f 2Na011 + 11,0+2ADA ? - 4NaVO3+2ADA ( reduced ) oxidation of the ADA : 2ADA ( reduced ) +02 ? p 2ADA+2H20 The process plant , in spite of these complex reactions , is quite simple , a packed column being used for the absorption stage , followed by a delay tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen sulfide are of the order of 1 ppm . Ferric oxide is the other reagent material that has been widely used for hydrogen sulfide removal . In aqueous suspension , the ferric oxide acts largely as a catalyst ( e.g. , Ferrox , Gluud , and Manchester processes ) 9 . Again , the suspension passing down a packed column is the absorbent , and the sulfur is recovered by blowing atmospheric oxygen through the sulfide-containing solution . Unfortunately , the sulfur from this process tends to be contaminated with iron oxide , reducing its subsequent usefulness . Ferric oxide , deposited in a finely divided state on peat or fibrous material , or in pellets , has long been used in " oxide boxes " for the removal of small amounts of hydrogen sulfide . The oxide may be subsequently recovered by combustion of the carrier material or by solvent extraction , using , for example , perchlor-ethylene . Here , in general terms , the reactions are absorption : 6H2S + 2Fe203 ? 2Fe2S3 + 6H20 regeneration : 2Fe2S3 + 602 ? - 2Fe203 + 3SO2 The reactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Appleby ? Frodingham process ) ( Fig. 5 ) . Hydrogen sulfide , at concentrations of 14 g/m3 in gas , has been reduced to 0.01 ? 0.03% by passing the gas through a four-stage fluidized bed maintained at 340 ? 360 ? C. The recovery stage is achieved by heating the ferric sulfide to 800 ? C in air . The sulfur dioxide driven off can be Chapter 7 used in making sulfuric acid . Unfortunately , in coal gas , hydrogen sulfide is usually accompanied by organic sulfides and thiophene , and the degree of removal is 70 ? 80% for the sulfides and only 30-45 ' % , for thiophene. lay placing a pretreatment stage into the system , which turns the sulfides and thiophenes to hydrogen sulfide , using special catalysts ( chromic alumina , cobalt molybdenum , zinc oxide , etc. ) , the overall process can be improved . There are many other processes that are used for hydrogen sulfide removal , and they are discussed at length in Yosmin et and Kohl and Riesenfeld.8 6.3 . Ammonia , Amines , and Pyridine Bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former two are also found in the waste gases from rendering of meat , offal , fish , etc. , and are characterized by their pungent and nauseous odor . Ammonia and the amines are very soluble in water and strong oxides , because of the reaction giving ammonium or alkyl ammonium ions . However , the solubility of these com-pounds in water falls off rapidly with rising temperature . In gas works practice one method is therefore a two-stage system , the first being a cooler of some sort ( shell and tube exchanger or spray cooler ) where the gases are cooled to 30 ? 50 ? C , followed by a water scrubber . The other system is a single-stage absorber and crystallizer , into which sulfuric acid is sprayed , ammonium sulfate crystallizing out in the bottom . The pyridine bases ( pyridine , picoline , aniline , and quinolene ) are removed in the same process . When ammonia and the ethylamines , and other amines in smaller con-centrations , are produced in rendering ( steam heating ) of animal and fish wastes , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off by the rendering , when this is condensed in shell and tube condensers of special design . In all these cases the final traces of the amines ( although not ammonia itself ) , can be efficiently removed by passing the waste gases through deep beds of activated carbon . 6.4 . Nitrogen Oxides There are six stable oxides of nitrogen ( N20 , NO , NO2 , N204 , N203 , and N205 ) , and of these , NO is mainly produced by combustion , while NO2 , N203 , and N205 are given off in some industrial operations such as pickling of metals prior to other treatment such as anodizing . The volumes from the latter processes are comparatively small , and scrubbing the gases with alkaline solution ( calcium hydroxide , sodium hydroxide , sodium carbonate , ammonium carbonate , etc. ) has been tried , but only with limited success , as few processes remove more than 70% . What does appear promising are those systems where the gases are passed rapidly over the liquid surface on special wave-formed plates , and such systems have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are passed through moist activated carbon also appear to be effective , although removal efficiencies are not quoted . Formation and Control of Air Pollutants 201 When nitrogen oxides are produced by combustion , the very large volumes and low concentrations preclude their removal by scrubbers . However , it has been found possible by careful attention to burner design and operation ( using tangential instead of opposed firing ) , two-stage combustion , partial recirculation of combustion gases ( up to 25% ) , and in some cases , derating the boiler , to reduce oxide of nitrogen production from well over 1000 ppm to 42 ppm ( required under Rule 67 , Los Angeles Air Pollution Control District ) . .5 . Fluorine and Fluorides Very low concentrations of fluorides ( of the order of parts per thousand million ) can damage vegetation , and so the removal of fluorides from waste gases from aluminum electrolysis plants , fertilizer plants , etc. , is essential . hydrogen fluoride is very soluble in water , and simple counterflow scrubbers , wet cell washers consisting of a succession of packed boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crossflow packed scrubbers , and floating bed scrubbers where plastic balls are fluidized in air and water , have all been found effective . When fluorine is present , water should be avoided , and a 5-10% sodium hydroxide solution is substituted . In aqueous and very low caustic ( less than 2% ) solutions , the very poisonous fluorine oxide , OF2 , is formed . In packed towers , with liquid gas contact times of about 1 minute , the following reactions occur : F2+2NaOH -3 102+H2O+2NaF HF+NaOH  --  NaF+H20 Sodium fluoride is then treated with lime to regenerate the hydroxide 2NaF+CaO+H20 -0 CaF2 ( ppct ) +2NaOH A very elegant method of recovering gaseous and particulate fluorides from aluminum smelters has been developed , where the waste gases are passed through a fluidized bed of alumina ? which will subsequently be used in the smelter ? and so return the emitted fluoride ( Alcoa process A398 ) . The temperature of absorption is 65-160 ? C , and the bed thickness 50-300 mm . The efficiency of the process is 99.2% or better for gaseous fluorides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being reduced from 100-200 mg/m3 to less than 3 mg/m3. 6.6 . Odors Unlike the gaseous air pollutants discussed above , odors generally occur in very low concentrations ? parts per million or less ? and must be reduced to much lower concentrations . Two methods are commonly employed , besides scrubbing , which was considered with reference to the amines ; these are , either adsorption on activated carbon , or combustion in a flame or on a catalyst surface . Chapter 7 Adsorption of odors on activated carbon is widely used , for food and cooking smells , for the remaining traces of amine , and for organic materials such as mercaptans , cresols , butyric acid , etc . The sources of active carbon can be coconut shells , wood , brown coal , coal , and other carbonaceous materials , which undergo destructive distillation and subsequent treatment by steam at elevated temperatures . The adsorptive capacity depends on the surface area of the carbon ( 200 ? 1200 m2/g ) , the temperature of adsorption , and the material . Usually , active carbon beds last from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The activated carbon can be reactivated by heating in an inert gas to 600 ? 650 ? C and then treating with steam . However , the reactivated material is unlikely to be as satisfactory as the original carbon . Flame combustion is widely used for disposal of waste hydrocarbons , odors , etc . In oil refineries and chemical works , where the ( fume energy ) concentration of the material is such as to produce self-supporting combustion , " flares " are used , but if these are fed with an aromatic material and air they tend to burn with a smoky flame . This is overcome by injecting steam into the flame which results in the water ? gas reaction , producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide , both of which burn smokelessly ( Fig. 6 ) . Steam-injected flares tend to be noisy , and considerable attention is now being paid to developing efficient flares with very limited noise . An alternative to the open flare is the closed combustion chamber , which can also be used if the fume energy in the pollutant gas , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame . In some cases , such as the black liquor drying odors in Kraft mill black liquor recovery , these can be passed through the combustion chamber of a boiler . Great care has to be taken , however , so that corrosion of boiler tubes is not accelerated , or the combustion temperature reduced so to make the unit ineffective . Special fume incinerators using diffusion or premixed flames have been developed , in which adequate retention time for complete oxidation is achieved . Catalytic combustion10 has the advantage that it occurs at 300 ? 400 ? C instead of at more than twice this temperature , as in direct-flame incineration , and so the problems of high-temperature heat exchange , and additional energy input in the case of low-fume energy , are reduced . Unfortunately , the catalysts used are expensive , and need occasional regeneration due to " poisoning " ( deactivation ) . This can be due to iron oxide , silica , or alumina dusts which permanently block the catalyst , or carbon , which can be burned off at intervals by heating the catalyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalysts ; for example , chlorides form cuprous chloride with copper oxide catalysts , sulfur compounds affect alumina catalysts , and organic phosphorus compounds from lubricating oils form phosphoric acid . Heavy metals also deactivate by covering the active sites . Thus , the use of catalytic oxidation should be restricted to those applications where there is little possibility of catalyst poisoning , as in treating the vapors from coffee roasting , bread baking , varnish cooking , etc. 7 . Control of Particulate Air Pollutants The first widely recognized form of air pollution was smoke , the fine particulate matter consisting partly of entrained ash in fuels and partly of Incomplete combustion . Even quite heavy smoke ? with concentrations of the // order of 2 ? 3 g/m ' represents only a volume concentration of about 1 ppmt Clean air regulations in most countries require abatement to concentrations of 0.1 g/m3 or less . In the most general terms , the control of particulate emissions involves passing the gases through a chamber in which a force acts on the particles and removes them from the gas stream . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centrifugal , or inertial , while for very small particles ( less than 0.5 ? ) the particle can also diffuse out of the gas stream . While the chamber can have one of a number of configurations , in nearly all cases the model for the collection process is the speed of the cross-stream movement of the particles , under the action of one of these forces , against the resistance of the gas during the residence time of the gas in the chamber . Thus , particles of the size ( as measured by their falling speed ) able to traverse the whole depth of the chamber ( or its equivalent ) are likely to be fully collected , while smaller particles are collected in proportion to the fraction of the depth of the chamber they are able to cross during the gas stream residence time . Except for particles larger than about 50 the gas resistance is usually simplified to a Stoke 's law resistance , and turbulent deposition , which may enter very sophisticated models , makes only a minor contribution to most collecting systems . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imply an actual chamber , but in most calculations this is an equivalent distance specific to the apparatus , such as the distance from wire to plate in an electrostatic precipitator , or the width of the entry into a cyclone . 7.1 . Settling Chambers In simple gravitational settling chambers ( Fig. 7 ) , which may simply be an enlargement in a duct carrying the gases , the efficiency of the chamber depends on the residence time of the gases in the chamber and the distance the particles travel under a gravitational force . The residence time in turn depends on the Formation and Control of Air Pollutants t chamber volume and on the volume flow . It is furthermore essential that the gas flow velocity is below that for reentrainment , which for most materials , except some light flaky substances , is greater than 3 m/sec . The simple settling chamber can be modified by inserting trays , which reduces the distance particles travel before collection . However , the trays are difficult to clean , so that the " Howard " multitray settling chamber has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 A similar theoretical concept can be applied to a plate-type electrostatic precipitator , but here the problems of the multiplate settling chamber have been overcome . First , the relatively weak gravitational force is replaced by the much stronger electrostatic force , acting on particles which have been charged , and these act horizontal to the gas stream into which vertical collection plates have been inserted . Second , after deposition of a layer of dust on these vertical plates , they are easily removed by shaking ( or hitting ) the plates , allowing the dust layer " cake " to fall down . I n practice ( Fig. 8 ) , in an electrostatic precipitator , wires are equispaced between plates , arranged at about 200 ? 300 mm apart and in line with the direction of the gas stream . The wires are charged negatively , in industrial practice , to 40 ? 60 kV , and the plates are earthed . If electrostatic precipitation is used for cleaning the air in air-conditioning systems , positive-charged wires ( I6 kV ) are used , as these produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasant in conditioned air . Chapter 7 In an electrostatic precipitator the gases immediately around the high-voltage discharge wire are broken down electrically , and gas ions are formed ( corona ) . The gas ions move toward the earthed plates , colliding with ( lust and other particles and charging them . The charge acquired is a function of the field strength , the surface area of a particle , and its dielectric constant . When the particle has been charged either by bombardment or by diffusion of the gas ions , it then migrates to the earthed plates . The velocity of this migration is a function of the charge on the particle , the field strength ( the driving force ) , and the gas resistance . For a particle in the micron sizes it is of the order of 10 ? 100 mm/sec , which must be compared with the much lower velocity ? on the order of 0.1 mm/sec ? of such a particle in a gravitational field . The particles , on settling on the plates , are discharged . When a cake has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technique called " rapping . " This model of electrostatic precipitation is much simplified , and ignores effects such as the electric wind ( the resultant effect of the moving gas ions ) ; the problems involved in a charge build-up in the layer of deposited dust , which occurs when this is a poor conductor such as cement dust , or fly-ash from some low-sulfur coals ; and the reentrainment of dust dislodged during " rapping . " Electrostatic precipitation is widely used for gas cleaning on a large scale in industry , outstanding examples being cement kilns and electricity generation boilers. 7.3 . Cyclones13 In cyclones , particles are spun in a rotating gas stream , and because of the centrifugal force on the particles they move to the walls , where they are removed by a secondary movement of the gas stream . There are two basic types of cyclones . The first is the straight-through type , where gases are spun by a bladed stator , and the dust is then concentrated in the outer layers of the gas as this spins through a chamber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is stripped off and led to a secondary collector , such as a settling chamber or a " reverse-flow " type cyclone . In the second type of cyclone , which is the conventional " reverse-flow " type ( Fig. 9 ) , the spinning gases are first moved toward a hopper ( or other collector ) , and then the gases , still spinning in the same direction , are reversed and led through a centrally placed exit pipe . The particles from the outer layer settle in the hopper . The gas entry can be through either a bladed , in-line stator , as in the first type , or , more frequently , through a tangential entry . There are three ways of calculating the effectiveness of a cyclone . The first is the model of a settling chamber , with a cross section equivalent to the tangential entry and a length equivalent to the " screw " path of the gas stream along the wall . In this " settling " chamber a force equal to the centrifugal force on the particle acts on the mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first used in 1932 , enables a range of efficiencies for particles of different sizes to be predicted . the bala mov volu The two other theories for predicting cyclone efficiencies consider , first , movement of the gas stream as a vortex , and second , as a particle held in nce between its intrinsic capacity to move towards the wall and the inward ement of the gases toward the exit . Both theories require empirical acting parameters , which enable the theoretical approaches to agree with rimental determinations of efficiency . Cyclones are widely used to remove particles above 10 ? ; they have the ntage of being simple to construct , relatively small in comparison with the mes of gas handled , and they have no moving parts . As a result , they can be Chapter 7 built from a wide range of materials that are able to withstand high tempera-tures and erosive conditions . A problem with cyclones is that about 40 ' % , of the energy input is converted to rotational energy , which , at present , is not recovered . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an appreciable amount . 7.4 . Filtration and Scrubbing In both gas filtration and scrubbing for removing small particles , the inertial forces possessed by the particles play a vital part . The gas stream passes by thefiber ( in a filter ) or droplet ( in a scrubber ) , and in passing the streamlines are diverted . The inertia possessed by the particles enables them to cross the gas streamlines and impinge on the collecting droplet or fiber . As a secondary mechanism , the collector also intercepts the particle , and very small particles ( of the order of 0.5 p , and less ) diffuse , to a significant extent , to the surface of the collector . All of these mechanisms act simultaneously , and they can be assisted ( or hindered ) by electrostatic and thermal forces acting between the particle and the collector . In general , the smaller the collecting body , the more effective it is likely to be as an interceptor . Thus the most efficient fabric and fiber filters consist of very fine fibers , of sizes 5 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of synthetic fibers . Once particles have reached the fiber surface they may bounce back into the gas stream or they may be retained on the fiber surface , mainly by van der Waals ' forces , although electrostatic forces and surface tension forces can also play a part . Once deposited , the particles as well as the fibers can act as interceptors for other particles in the gas stream . Formation and Control of Air Pollutants 209 In time a cake can build up on the fiber surface which is , at intervals , Oaken or blown oft . For filtering particles in low concentrations , as , for example , in atmospheric air , a deep bed of fine fibers is very effective . This is kept in position , without particle removal , for periods on the order of several months . On the other hand , high concentrations of particles in industrial waste gases are deposited on filter cloths formed into tubes or into sleeves supported on wire ( Fig. 10 ) . The dusts are deposited on these in a cake , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervals , the cake is blown or shaken off . Filtration efficiency immediately after this is somewhat lower than the maximum because of the time required for the cake to reform . On the other hand , the pressure loss at this stage is low and the filter is able to handle a large throughput . In practice , an optimum has to be found between the permissible pressure loss , the volume of gas handled , and the efficiency , as well as the size , of the unit . Chapter 7 In liquid scrubbing ' for particles , these units can range front simple countercurrent spray towers to those where the gas stream breaks through a wall of water . In all cases , the finer the droplets used ( or produced in the scrubber ) , the more effective the scrubber . However , fine particles are entrained in the gas stream and must be removed by some method also used for particles . In simple spray towers the optimum droplet size is 800 which is not effective in removing particles smaller than about 50 or on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrubber ( Fig. 11 ) , where the droplets are sprayed into a cyclone , the optimum droplet size is about 100 p. , and particle collection is again effective down to one order of magnitude smaller ( i.e. , 10 ? ) . Extensive experiments have shown that secondary effects , such as evaporation or condensation of the liquid , play virtually no part in the collection because of the brief period of contact . The most effective scrubbers for fine particles are the venturi scrubbers , where the gas stream breaks a curtain of water at high velocity . The small droplets formed , the high degree of turbulence , and possibly other effects such as sweep diffusion , enable even submicron particles to be collected . However , the energy consumption of these units is very high . All of these collectors for particles are widely used in industry : in the chemical industry , in minerals extraction , etc. , whenever fine particles are produced . A general conclusion is that the finer particles generally require larger , technologically more advanced equipment , with higher energy con-sumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less air pollution . However , this may require further technical developments , or new processes , rather than an added-on control system . The Interaction of Gaseous Pollutants with Materials at the Surface of the Earth D. J. Spedding 1 . Introduction Gaseous materials released into the atmosphere as the result of the activity of man suffer a variety of fates , depending upon their chemistry in the atmosphere , and this in turn influences their lifetime in the atmosphere . Sulfur dioxide , for example , has a mean lifetime in the atmosphere of only a few days , while methane has a mean lifetime of about 20 years . One of the ways of removing a gaseous pollutant from the atmosphere is through interaction with materials at the surface of the earth . Such interactions may result only in the destruction of the pollutant with no obvious damaging effects on the environment , or , on the other hand , the interactions may lead to quite noticeable effects on the environment . In the following sections of this Chapter 8 chapter some rather arbitrarily selected interactions of gaseous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate both types of interaction . 2 . The Oceans : Sinks and Sources of Atmospheric Gases 2.1 . Introduction Since the oceans occupy more than 70% of the total surface area of the earth , interactions at the surface of the ocean are of potential importance for all pollutants that are widely dispersed in the troposphere . If a gas is to he transferred from the troposphere , it must first diffuse in the gas phase to the surface of the ocean , cross the gas ? liquid boundary , and finally diffuse into the bulk of the ocean . There are two basic theoretical models that can be used to predict these diffusion processes : the stagnant film model , and the more recent film replacement model . It has recently been shown that these two models produce essentially similar results ' ; the commonly used stagnant film model will be discussed here . 2.2 . Theory In the stagnant film model the bulk of both phases is taken as being well mixed by the turbulent diffusion , but at either side of the boundary between the phases there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place only by molecular diffusion ( see Fig. 1 ) . It is the rate of transfer through these layers that determines the overall rate of transfer from one phase to the other . The flux J of gas passing through either of the boundary layers is described in the general case by Fick 's first law of diffusion : J= ? D-x ( 1 ) where J is the number of moles of gas crossing the unit area of a plane perpendicular to the direction of flow in unit time ; the concentration gradient , Sc/Sx , is the rate of increase of concentration c , with distance x , measured in the direction of the flow ; and D is the diffusion coefficient . In gas exchange studies , where it is assumed that the transfer across the interface is a steady-state process , equation ( 2 ) is the form of Fick 's law that is used : =Dc J O x where Ac is the concentration difference measured from the interface to the outer edge of the boundary layer , at distance x from the interface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gas exchange constant , k , which is defined as k = D/x ( 3 ) equation ( 2 ) may thus be written in simplified form as J = k &c; ( 4 ) The concentration of the gas being transferred across the boundary layer is CA in the bulk air and cw in the bulk water . It is assumed that these concentrations are constant up to the edges of the respective boundary layers . ' he concentration of the transferring gas in the gas phase at the interface is cA , which may be greater or less than CA , depending upon whether the flux of gas is out of or into the water . The corresponding liquid phase concentration of the gas in the liquid phase at the interface is c ' , . Since , in a steady-state process , the flux of gas across both boundary layers is identical , equation ( 5 ) arises from the equality of equation ( 4 ) for each layer J = kg ( cA ? cA ) = kr ( cw ? c'w ) ( 5 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas and liquid phases , respectively . There also exists a relationship between cA and c ; t. , assuming that the gas involved in the transfer obeys Henry 's law ( H is the Henry 's law constant ) : cA=HcW ( 6 ) Using equation ( 6 ) , cA can be eliminated from equation ( 5 ) and following an Chapter 8 algebraic manipulation to eliminate c H J = kikg ( c Hcw ) ( 7 ) ki + kgH Rearrangement of equation ( 7 ) gives the equalities expressed as cA ? Hcw cA/H ? cw J 1/kg+H/k , +1/Hkg ( x ) Finally , if the denominators in equation ( 8 ) are replaced by 1/Kg and 1/K1 , it can be written as J=Kg ( cA ? Hcw ) =Ki H ? cww ( 9 ) cA It is helpful to visualize the transfer of a gas from one phase to another as being subjected to a resistance R to its transfer . This resistance is analogous to electrical resistance and , continuing the analogy , is equivalent to the reciprocal of the conductance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen , the transfer coefficient may be expressed either on a gas phase basis , Kg , or on a liquid phase basis , K1 . The total resistance R to gaseous transfer is made up of two components : resistance in the gase phase , rg , and resistance in the liquid phase , ri . The relationship between the parameters in equation ( 8 ) and these resistances is expressed as R =1/Kg =1/K1= ( 1/k , + 1/Hkg ) = ( r1 + rg ) ( 10 ) The relative contributions of rl and rg to R depend to a considerable extent on the solubility and solution chemistry of the transferring gas . In almost all cases one or other of rg or ri predominates and this has a profound effect on the behavior of the gas at the surface of the ocean . We will now consider two pollutant gases whose properties are such that rg dominates R ( sulfur dioxide ) , and ri dominates R ( carbon monoxide ) . 2.3 . Sulfur Dioxide Transfer In order to understand the transfer of sulfur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemistry of SO2 must be considered : Interaction of Gaseous Pollutants pl I and total S(IV) concentration define the amounts of the above S(1V) species that exist in a solution of SO2 . Inspection of the values of K1 and K2 Indicates that only in solutions of pH , 2 does molecular SO2 exist in high concentration . At higher pH values , transport of SO2 across the solution boundary layer involves transfer of ionic species across the layer . These ionic xpecies have a higher solution mobility than molecular SO2 , so as pH increases , the value of r1 decreases . This is very well illustrated in Fig. 2 . The constant value for R at pH 4 can be shown to be completely dominated by rg . As most natural waters are of pH 4-9 , and as the oceans are at about pH 8 , it can be seen that with SO2 the ability to ionize in solution has a dominating influence on its transfer properties from the troposphere to the oceans.2 The thickness of the air boundary layer which determines rg varies with wind velocity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of increasing Kg ( or decreasing rg ) , as may be seen in Fig. 3 . If the value for Kg at the highest wind velocity in Fig. 3 is taken as representative of the exchange constant under average wind conditions over the ocean , it is possible to calculate the potential transfer of SO2 from the atmosphere to the ocean . Taking Kg as 1.4 cm/sec , the total area of the oceans as 3.7 x 1018 cm2 , and the average SO2 level in the ocean air as 0.5 ? g/m3 , the transfer of SO2 from the atmosphere to the oceans is 8.2 x 107 tonnes/year . The importance of the ocean as a sink of atmospheric SO2 can be seen when the oceanic absorption of SO2 is compared with the estimated 14 x 107 tonnes/year of SO2 emitted as the result of the combustion of fossil fuels.3 ' 4 During 1974 ? 75 several field measurements of the gas transfer coefficient Kg have been made . Whelpdale and Shaw107 foung Kg values of the order of 1 cm/sec for SO2 transfer to fresh water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposition of SO2 into artificial ponds of seawater indicated that Kg was 0.5 ? 0.1 cm/sec . A large-scale aircraft sam-pling program109 over and about the United Kingdom produced data that predicted that Kg was in the range of 0.6 ? 0.8 cm/sec . These recent data suggest that the estimate of the annual transfer of SO2 to the oceans is probably overestimated by about a factor of two , and is more likely to be 4 x 10117 tonnes/year. 2.4 . Carbon Monoxide Transfer The study of the exchange of carbon monoxide from the atmosphere to the oceans has an interesting history . Early studies5 were able to identify only a Interaction of Gaseous Pollutants tncni maul. combustion source of CO . Concern for the possibility that CO may at t.unmlatc in the atmosphere led to a study of the ocean as a potential sink for tilt . p , ; is . I lowever , in recent years , a number of large natural sources of CO have been found , including the surface of the ocean. ? It now appears that much of the surface of the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration gradient of the gas is from the ocean to the atmosphere . ' Sinks hit ( ' ( ) exist in the form of gas-phase atmospheric reactions8 and utilization by microorganisms at the surface of the earth.9 The magnitude of the flux of CO from the ocean to the atmosphere is of importance in assessing the relative importance of the contribution of pollutant CO to the total natural CO cycle . Unlike SO2 , carbon monoxide does not react chemically with water , remaining in a molecular form . With this gas there is no enhancement of transfer across the liquid boundary layer and it is found that r1 dominates the transfer process.2 The numerical value of K , can be obtained using the estimated ' oceanic boundary layer thickness of 30 ? in equation ( 3 ) , together with the diffusion coefficient for CO of 2.2 x 10-9 m2/sec 1D 2.2x10-9 Ki n xi 3 x 10-s I Ise of this value in equation ( 4 ) to obtain the flux of CO from the ocean to the a t mosphere requires a knowledge of the CO concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is assumed that the CO concentration in st ) l ution at the ocean-air interface is essentially the same as that of the air at the surface of the ocean.2 Measurements have been made of both air and ocean CO ) llcentrations in cruises in research ships in both hemispheres in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans . ' A considerable difference has been found between the atmospheric concentration of CO in the Northern Hemisphere ( 0.13 ppm ) and that in the Southern Hemisphere ( 0.04 ppm ) . The concentration in the ocean surface water is relatively constant over all the oceans in both hemispheres , averaging 6 x 10 ? 8 cm3 CO per cm3 water . The concentration gradient in the ocean is thus ( 6 x 10-8-2.6 x 10-9 ) cm3 CO/cm3 H2O . The latter figure is obtained by expressing the aerial CO concentration , 1.3 x 10 cm3 CO/cm3 air , on a liquid phase basis by dividing by the Henry 's law constant for CO . Use of equation ( 4 ) leads to a value of 5 x 10-9 g m-2 sec-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere . Calculations using the southern hemisphere aerial CO concentration show only a small change in the flux , because the concentration difference in equation ( 4 ) is in this case dominated by the ocean surface CO concentration . A value for the total flux of CO from the oceans may thus be obtained assuming the flux to be constant over all the oceans . This flux is 5.85 x 10 ' tonnes/year . This may be compared to the estimated global CO emissions from combustion sources6 of 46 x 1o ' tonnes/year , and from the natural oxidation of methane by hydroxyl radicals in the troposphere of 150x 10 ' tonnes/year . The ocean has thus passed from being a potential sink for combustion CO to a minor natural source Chapter 8 of the gas , although it has recently been suggested ' 1 " that it may act as either a source or a sink in different areas . 2.5 . Dimethyl Sulfide Transfer The cycle of sulfur in the environment is usually balanced by an emission of hydrogen sulfide from the ocean to the atmosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed " as being that necessary to balance the sulfur cycle.10 Early forms of the sulfur cycle3 suggested that H2S was emitted generally from the ocean surface . More recently4 this has been modified to include only areas where ocean deep water upwells from anoxic depths and to tidal mudflats . Several workers4 have warned against overestimating the H2S contribution to the cycle noting that even one meter coverage of ascending H2S with aerated seawater will oxidize it quantitatively and prevent its emission . In 1972,10 dimethyl sulfide was found in the ocean surface water at an average concentration of 1.2 x 10-11 g/cm3 . This discovery led to the postula-tion that ( CH3 ) 2S may be the gas necessary to carry sulfur from the ocean to the atmosphere in order to balance the sulfur cycle . Unfortunately , no quantitative measurements of the gas have been made in the air over the ocean , but it is well known over the land largely as an emission from paper manufacturing proces-ses . Rasmussen " ' has used gas chromatography to show that dimethyl sul-fide and dimethyl disulfide dominated over H2S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waters . Only in anaerobic conditions was H2S found to be dominant . A calculation has been made of the potential of the ocean as a source of atmospheric ( CH3 ) 2S , assuming the maximum possible concentration gradient over the water boundary layer , i.e. , a zero concentration of the gas at the ocean-atmosphere interface.2 This calculation suggests that ( CH3 ) 2S would constitute a maximum emission of 4% of the total sulfur necessary to balance the sulfur cycle . ( CH3 ) 2S must thus be produced in large quantities outside the oceans , or else some other sulfur compound , perhaps even H2S , acts to complete the cycle . 3 . Vegetation as a Sink for Gaseous Pollutants 3.1 . Introduction Although land forms only about 30% of the total area of the globe , it offers a large surface area of vegetation to the gases in the atmosphere . Plants way take up atmospheric gases without active metabolism in the same manner as inorganic materials or , more importantly , they may actively metabolize the gas , thus creating a favorable concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known example of the latter case . It is also a pollutant gas , being the major end product of the complete combustion of carbon in fossil fuels . interaction of Gaseous Pollutants 221 3 ' l Theory The . rate of transport of a gas from the atmosphere to plant leaves may be expressed in a manner similar to that discussed earlier for transport to water outfaces . The total resistance R to the transport can be written as the sum of individual resistances to transport to the final deposition sites for the gas in the Ica t . " Figure 4 outlines these resistances , which are summarized as 1 1 1 + ( 16 ) R ra + re ? r ra + rs + rifles is the resistance to transfer across the air boundary layer over the surface of the leaf . This is calculated in the same way as the comparable resistance over c surface of water . For the purposes of this discussion , the leaf will be 222 Chapter 8 presumed to have identical upper and lower sill laces and the resistances will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to he the sum of both surfaces . The surface of leaves is covered by a waxy layer known as the cuticle . A number of gases are sorbed by the cuticle or by the thin film of water on the cuticle at high air humidities . The resistance to transfer to this surface is expressed as rC1t . The leaf surface is penetrated by a large number of openings , the stomata . These are under metabolic control and may be opened or closed in response to physiological conditions . In light and in high air humidity the stomata open , and in dark and in low air humidity they close . The resistance to transfer through these openings , rs , thus varies from a low value for open stomata to a very high value for closed stomata . After it has traversed the stomata , the gas can diffuse to the surface of cells within the leaves . The cell surfaces are covered by a film of water , the air spaces within the leaf being at 100% relative humidity . Transfer to these mesophyll cell surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transport across the air boundary layer depends on wind speed ( which affects the thickness of the layer ) and on the diffusivity of the transferring gas.14 The value of ra may thus be calculated from simple physical parameters . Under conditions when the stomata are closed , the value of rCut can be calculated if R and ra are known . The sum of rs and rmes may be obtained ( following the determination of R , ra , and rC11 , ) when the stomata are fully opened . These two resistances may be separated by measuring all the resistances to transfer for water vapor . This gas is subject to resistances ra + rs . There is zero resistance to the transport of water vapor to the thin film of water on the mesophyll surfaces and to the cuticle.14 A measurement of R and ra hence enables rs to be calculated for a particular leaf . It is assumed generally that rs for water vapor is about the same as rs for most other gases . The basic measurements necessary for obtaining quantitative data for the resistances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1 ) the total resistance R , and ( 2 ) the air boundary layer resistance , ra . The quantity normally measured is not the total resistance R but its reciprocal , vg , which is known as the velocity of deposition and is defined as15 v = 1 J = Total deposition per unit area ( 17 ) g R C Dosage ( concentration x time ) Here , J , the flux of the gas to the surface , is usually expressed in ? g/cm2 sec . C is the volumetric concentration of the gas in the air at some appropriate reference point clear of the air boundary layer , and is expressed in p , g/cm3 . The units of vg are thus cm/sec . The evaluation of vg under field conditions is normally carried out using the first form of vg , i.e. , J/C . The velocity of deposition may also be measured using the second form in equation ( 17 ) , where the total deposition per unit area is expressed in p , g/cm2 and the dosage is expressed in p , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time integral of the gas concentration , allows direct measurement of vg even though Interaction of Gaseous Pollutants 223 the gas concentration varies during the experiment . This form of vg is often used in laboratory determinations of gaseous deposition and in field measurements using radiolabeled gases which give a direct measure of deposition per unit area . It can he seen that vg(=.1/C) is analogous to the exchange constant K ( = J/OC ) when it is assumed that the deposition is an irreversible process and the concentration of the gas at the solid surface is zero . 3.3 . Experimental Observations In recent years an increasing number of experiments have been carried out to determine vg for plant leaves . Initial efforts involved laboratory studies on gas deposition to individual leaves ( Table 1 ) ; more recently , techniques have been developed to obtain field data on natural vegetation ( Table 2 ) . It is quite clear from these data that many pollutant gases are actively taken up by plants . This is particularly obvious when large differences in resistance are found between conditions promoting open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomatal resistance ( together with other internal resistances ) is represented by ( R ? ra ) . All of the major pollutant gases illustrated , except carbon monoxide , appear to be involved in plant metabolism to a considerable extent . Comparison of data obtained in the laboratory on individual leaves with field data for a complete plant canopy offers some difficulty . The laboratory gas uptake data are usually expressed as mass of gas sorbed per unit plan area of plant leaf surface , while field data are expressed as uptake per unit plan area of plant canopy . With the layering of leaves through the depth of the canopy , the vg value obtained in the field appears larger than the laboratory vg value . Measurements have been made of the average area of leaf per unit plan area of vegetation canopy for a number of types of vegetation . This is usually expressed as a ratio known as the leaf area index , which varies from one type of vegetation to another as the density of leaves through the canopy changes . The use of the leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the type given in Tables 1 and 2 have been used to explore the role of vegetation as a sink for pollutant gases on a global scale . The calculations involved in such studies include , in the best case , an extrapolation from gas uptake by the plant canopy in a field to total global uptake . In the worst case , the extrapolation is from gas uptake by a single leaf to total global uptake . The reader is thus warned to exercise caution when studying these types of data . In Table 4 , vegetation uptake of gases at concentrations typical of a polluted area is calculated . The final column of the table indicates the height of the column of polluted air that would be depleted by one square meter of the named vegetation , if it is assumed that the vg value is correct . It is obvious that the grass-like vegetation for which deposition data are available have a considerable capacity to reduce 03 , SO2 , and NO2 concentrations in polluted areas . In a report to Charles II in the seventeenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the pollutant concentration in the air of 225 London.16 Although trees have a leaf area index 60 ? 70% ? that of the grasses ? it can be seen that the advice of John Evelyn was indeed valid . Chapter 8 4 . Plant Damage by Gaseous Pollutants 4.1 . Introduction In the previous section it was noted that most gaseous pollutants are actively metabolized by plants . However , many plant species are susceptible to damage by very low concentrations of pollutant gases . It is an interesting observation that in general plants are damaged by pollutant gases at lower concentrations than are animals . This is especially true with ozone , PAN , and sulfur dioxide . As is usual with a general statement , there are exceptions , the most notable being carbon monoxide , which affects plants at concentrations higher than those affecting animals . There is a large body of information on the nature of the damage to plant leaves by pollutant gases . Formulas have been derived to relate pollutant gas dosage to the degree of plant damage.25 Knowledge of the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of a pollutant gas and to obtain a rough estimate of its concentration by observing the damage to a variety of selected plant species . ' ' ' ' ' It is unfortunate that studies on the biochemical basis of plant damage have lagged behind the plant pathological studies . It is only in recent years that information has emerged on some of the points of attack of gaseous pollutants in the metabolism of plants . In this section this information will be summarized and discussed . 4.2 . The Problem of Selecting Suitable Dosages It has been well established that the uptake of pollutant gases by plants is related to the solubility of those gases in the water film on the mesophyll cells.28 Since solution of the gases usually results in ionization , the resulting ions may also be involved in metabolic disruption . Many investigations of the metabolic behavior of gaseous pollutants in plants have been carried out in aqueous solutions containing these ions . A major difficulty in this type of investigation in the choice of the concentration of the ion in solution is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas . There is no method for adequately calculating the ion concentrations , especially as most are continuously depleted by their normal metabolism within the cells . The oxyanions of nitrogen and sulfur are specific examples of normal cell metabolites that also arise from the solution of pollutant gases in cell water . Individual workers have made their own choices of suitable concentrations for their investigations , and as a consequence it is difficult to compare results because of frequent wide divergences in the concentrations studied . In Tables 5 , 6 , and 7 an indication is given of pollutant gas dosages that lead to visible effects on sensitive plants . This dosage , together with the average concentration of the given gas in a polluted atmosphere , should be kept in mind when studying the data in the tables . Chapter d 4.3 . Effects of Ozone and PAN Both ozone and PAN act as oxidizing agents in solution , and their main effect in plants appears to be the oxidation of sulfydryl groups.29 These groups are important in the structure of proteins , and enzyme activity is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain . Oxidation by ozone and PAN largely results in the formation of disulfides , and it is likely that the inhibition of individual enzyme activity by these gases is related to this oxidation.3 ? The solubility of ozone in water28 at 20 ? C , and with an ozone partial pressure of one atmosphere , is 12 mmol/dm3 . If it is assumed that Henry 's law applies , then at an ozone partial pressure of 1 ppm , the ozone concentration in solution is 0.012 p , mol/dm3 . It is obvious that inhibition studies using ozone gas concentrations of about 1 ppm are much closer to the real situation than are studies using ozone solution concentrations in the mmol/dm3 range . It is therefore most likely that in the real situation peroxidase is activated rather than inhibited by ozone ( see metabolic transformations , Table 5 ) . Similar arguments can undoubtedly be applied to PAN , although ionization of this gas in solution yields normal cell metabolites . Photosynthesis ( and possibly other energy-producing pathways ) is affected by both PAN and ozone . The nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be hoped that the increasing activity in this field will lead to an understanding of the effect . Ozone is known to cause stomatal closure at realistic dosages31 ; this undoubtedly has an overall effect on photo-synthesis in limiting gas exchange , but is unlikely to be the real effect on the photosynthetic pathway . 4.4 . Effects of Sulfur Dioxide With sulfur dioxide a similar physiological effect has been observed with the stomata ; however , stomatal opening is promoted by low dosages and closure is promoted.by high dosages.32 Increased stomatal opening would lead to water stress under appropriate conditions , but the relationship of this physiological effect to leaf metabolism is not at all clear . Most of the studies of sulfur dioxide effects on leaf metabolism have been carried out with sulfite solutions in the millimole concentration range . An attempt has been made to relate gas-phase sulfur dioxide concentration with its equilibrium concentra-tion , taking into account reactions ( excluding oxidation ) in solution . This is shcwn in graphic form in Fig. 5 . At SO2 concentration of 100 ? g/m3 ( about 0.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all S(IV) species is 36 1 mol/dm3 . This figure would be higher if the buffer capacity of mesophyll water could be estimated and taken into account . On the other hand , oxidation and metabolism have not been considered , and these would act to-reduce the concentration . A sulfite concentration in the range 0.1-0.5 mmol/dm3 would thus seem reasonable for experimental studies of sulfur oxide effects on leaf metabolism . The sulfite concentrations investigated have most invariably been in excess of 1 mmol/dm3 , and because the effects vestigated have been on the photosynthetic pathway , this choice of concen- ? ation is of considerable importance . It has been observed34 ' 116 that 14CO2 ation by isolated chloroplasts is increased by sulfite concentrations of 1 mmol/dm3 , but decreased by concentrations 1 mmol/dm3 . It could thus be said that many of the investigations of sulfur dioxide effects on photosyn-thesis are invalid , in that the plants may not experience the sulfite concentra-tions used . Experimentation to obtain direct measurements of cell water sulfite concentrations in plants exposed to realistic atmosphere sulfur dioxide con-centrations is thus of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulfite used in the investigations summarized in Table 7 are realistic , then it can be seen that photosynthesis is indeed affected by sulfur dioxide fumigation . The enzyme inhibition is either by competition between SO3- and HCO3 as a substrate , 35 ' 36 or by competition between glycollate and sulfoglycollate.37 The latter compound has been iso-lated from rice plants exposed to sulfur dioxide.38 Recent reviews have emphasized the need for more work on the biochemi-cal nature of pollutant gas effect on plant metabolism.66 ' 67 The data outlined in Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate this need , which must be coupled with a soundly based selection of pollutant gas concentration for use in the investigations . Finally , Pahlich122 has attempted to unify most of the data pertaining to SO2 effects on plants in a general theory of the mode of action of gaseous pollutants . Basically , he suggested that at low dosages SO2 is converted to organic compounds after absorption , and that enzymes are unaffected . If the dosage is such that conversion to organic sulfur is not complete , the inorganic sulfur concentra-tions may cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Introduction One of the most costly effects of atmospheric pollution by sulfur dioxide is its accelerating influence on the corrosion of metals . The cost must be meas-ured not only in terms of replacement or repair costs of corroded structures , but also in terms of the cost of anticorrosion treatment . Most of the costs are associated with the corrosion of iron and its alloys , but other important metals used in outdoor construction ? zinc , copper , and aluminum ? also suffer accel-erated corrosion in the presence of sulfur dioxide . In the past , most scientific and technological investigations have been concerned with methods of reducing corrosion , largely by the application of surface coatings . In recent years , however , some understanding has been obtained of the nature of the involvement of sulfur dioxide in the corrosion process . This section will deal for the most part with a discussion of the role of sulfur dioxide in the atmospheric corrosion of iron . 5.2 . Atmospheric Corrosion of Iron When test panels of iron ( or steel ) are exposed to the atmosphere at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest corrosion occurs in industrial environments and the least in inland rural environments.68 The Interaction of Osseous Pollutants 233 difference in corrosion rate has been attributed to the higher sulfur dioxide concentrations in industrial atmospheres.69 In atmospheres with very low sulfur dioxide concentrations , the main corrosion products on the surface of n are a-FeOOH , y-FeOOH , Fe3O4i and some amorphous material.70 It is now generally agreed69 ' 71.123 that the mechanism of the formation of ese compounds is electrochemical , and takes place in a thin water film on the etal surface . In simplified form , the initial corrosion reactions are Fe  --  4 Fee++2e ( anodic reaction ) ( 18 ) 202+H2O+2e ? 2OH- ( cathodic reaction ) ( 19 ) e reactions following reactions ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) depend upon the pH of the Ater film . If the pH is very alkaline , reaction ( 20 ) follows , while if it is slightly kaline , reaction ( 21 ) is found : 4Fe(OH)2+02 -3 4aFeOOH+2H2O ( 20 ) 6Fe(OH)2+02 ? - 2Fe3O4+6H2O ( 21 ) en the pH is neutral or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ace is taken by various Fe(II) hydroxo complexes involving other anions in lution . These anions reflect the atmospheric environment to which the iron s exposed , e.g. , chloride is found in marine environments , and sulfate is and in industrial environments . The Fe(II) hydroxo complexes are also idized by dissolved oxygen , resulting in the y-modification of FeOOH . On the microscale , the surface of iron exposed to the atmosphere can be en to be covered by a two-layer film of oxidation products ( Fig. 6 ) .69 At the surface of the pure metal , the anodic reaction ( 18 ) occurs , while at the interface the Fe3O4 and FeOOH layers , the cathodic reaction ( 19 ) takes place . This tter reaction is followed by oxidation with molecular oxygen , yielding eOOH or Fe3O4i depending upon the hydrogen ion activity . The overall ffect of the anodic plus cathodic reactions is that one Fe atom is transferred om the pure metal and is deposited as FeOOH at the bottom of the surface yer . As the anodic and cathodic sites are separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit . The Fe3O4 layer serves as an lectron conductor , while soluble ferrous salts in solution in the Fe3O4 layer act s an ionic conductor . Of the soluble ferrous salts , FeSO4 is the most important . The source of e sulfur in this salt is atmospheric sulfur dioxide . The initial step in the rrosion process may thus be considered to be the absorption of sulfur dioxide y the metal surface . The amount of sulfur dioxide absorbed is increased by the presence of rust , 72 ' 74 surface particles , 73 and relative humidity.74 ' 75 In the absence of rust and surface particles , sulfur dioxide is absorbed at specific sites on the iron surface76 which are not related to any structural dislocation such as grain boundaries . " It has been proposed that the absorption sites are activated by water vapor , and that there sulfur dioxide is adsorbed by a surface oxide and is oxidized to sulfate in the adsorbed state:78 ' 79 Fe(II)oxide+SO2+02  --  FeSO4(ads)oxide ( 22 ) The electrochemical mechanism of rusting requires FeSO4 only as an ionic conductor . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the need for further addition of sulfur dioxide to form further FeSO4.80 It would thus be expected that an infinite amount of FeOOH could be formed in the presence of a finite amount of FeSO4 . This is not found to be the case because a slow reaction resulting in the formation of insoluble basic iron sulfates is continually removing ferrous and sulfate ions from solution.69 The accelerated corrosion of iron in atmospheres of high sulfur dioxide concentration is hence closely related to the maintenance of an FeSO4 solution in the lower oxide layer . Similarly , increased rusting in high humidities is related to the maintenance of an aqueous solution in the lower oxide layer . At low atmospheric humidities this solution dries out , and the electrochemical process is disrupted , lacking an ionic conductor . It should be noted here that Misawa et al.71 have cast doubt on the suggestion that Fe304 is the basic constituent of the lower oxide layer on iron . They suggest that it is an amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide , FeOX(OH)32X , which in aqueous solution is a good electronic conductor . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the oxide layers , the electrochemical mechanism would operate under both conditions and the involvement of sulfur dioxide would be the same . Interaction of Gaseous Pollutants 5.3 . Atmospheric Corrosion of Other Metals 6.3.1 . Zinc The main use of zinc in outdoor structures is that of a sacrificial surface ating on iron and steel . The surface film of insoluble basic zinc carbonate rmed on zinc in the atmosphere ' is its normal means of protection . Atmo-heric sulfur dioxide concentration is a major factor in controlling the rate of rrosion of zinc.82 Sulfur dioxide is absorbed uniformly over a zinc surface , 83 e mass absorbed increasing with relative humidity.74 ' 75 The accelerated rrosion of zinc by sulfur dioxide may be due to the formation of soluble SO4 at the outer surface of the protective film , 84 or to the action on the surface film of the acidic solution produced when sulfur dioxide dissolves in the urface water layer . The uniform uptake of sulfur dioxide at all humidities on nc suggests that the former mode of attack is more likely . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs at the outer surface of the protective film , hile that of iron occurs at the interface between two oxide layers on its urface.83 .3.2 . Copper The corrosion of copper in the atmosphere is very slow , resulting in the rmation of a blue ? green patina . Observations of copper roofs in Scandinavia ave shown that the rate of production of the patina has increased as the tmospheric sulfur dioxide concentration has increased.85 Newly formed atina has a composition of CuSO4.6Cu(OH)2 , while older patina becomes SO4.3Cu(OH)2.Obviously , sulfur dioxide has become incorporated into the rrosion product . Little is known about the mechanism of the formation of the atina or about the involvement of sulfur dioxide in the mechanism . Although he mass of sulfur dioxide sorbed by copper increases with relative humidity , it is much lower than that for iron and zinc copper and is confined to specific sites on the surface.83 6.3.3 . Aluminum Observations of aluminum panels exposed for long periods of time to a variety of atmospheric environments have shown a strong correlation between the corrosion rate of aluminum and the sulfur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on aluminum in industrial atmospheres is Al2(SO4)3.18H2O.87 At low relative humidities , very little sulfur dioxide is taken up by aluminum and most of this is physically adsorbed ' ' At higher humidities , an increasing mass of sulfur dioxide is taken up , although the total mass adsorbed is much less than that for iron and zinc.74 ' 87The suggested mechanism for the accelerated corrosion of aluminum in the presence of sulfur dioxide is an acid attack on the protective oxide film , the acid being derived from the solution and oxidation of sulfur dioxide in the water film on the metal surface.87 Chapter 8 6 . Indoor Reactions of Pollutant Gases 6.1 . Introduction The concentration of pollutant gases is highest in urban areas , and it is in these areas that the population spend most of their lives indoors . Studies of the fate of pollutant gases in the enclosed volumes found in indoor environments are thuse of considerable importance . The nature of indoor surfaces is quite different than those found outdoors , which suggests that the rate of deposition of pollutants from the indoor atmosphere may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have surfaces in three dimensions with which to interact , whereas outdoors the interaction is possible only in one dimension , if one ignores the reactions within the gas phase which occur in both environ-ments . In this section , the effect of these interactions on the indoor concentra-tion of some gaseous pollutants will be discussed , together with a survey of the possible damaging effects of the interactions . 6.2 . Indoor Pollutant Gas Concentrations Health physicists , who have a responsibility for assessing the damaging effects of airborne radionuclides , have recognized for some time that man is exposed to a lower radiation dose from nuclear debris indoors than he is outdoors . Iodine-131 is the major gaseous product arising from a fission process , and studies on this gas have shown it to be drastically reduced in ? concentration indoors.88 It is thus likely that air pollutant gases of a chemical reactivity similar to iodine also show a reduction in concentration indoors . Table 8 shows that both sulfur dioxide and ozone are reduced in concentration indoors , while carbon monoxide , nitrogen dioxide , and PAN show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all gases except sulfur dioxide are very limited . Studies have been made of the rate of removal of ozone from a variety of containers and rooms . It has been found that the rate of removal increases as relative humidity increases , 92 and that the nature of the container walls has an Table 8 . Relationship between Indoor and Outdoor Concentrations of Pollutant Gases Interaction of Nevus Pollutants 237 influence on the rate90 : the first-order half-life for the removal of ozone was 28 min in a stainless steel container and only 13 min in an aluminum container . Further , studies indicate that not all collisions of ozone with an aluminum container at high relative humidity result in the removal of ozone from the gas phase . ' Z Ozone is well known as a strong oxidizing agent and this , together with its reactivity toward many organic molecules , probably accounts for its destruction at solid surfaces . The increased removal of ozone from the gas phase with increased relative humidity suggests that oxidation in the thin water film on solid surfaces is the major removal mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained by the presence of different materials in the water films.92 Use of the activated carbon filters associated with air conditioning systems has been shown to be very effective in reducing the ozone concentration in air used to ventilate buildings.90 A number of studies have been made of the rate of removal of atmospheric sulfur dioxide by indoor surfaces . The results obtained are rather variable , which is not surprising since the rate of deposition of sulfur dioxide on solid surfaces is very dependent upon humidity , e.g. , the first-order half-life for sulfur dioxide removal from a gloss-painted box at 30% relative humidity was 163 min , while at 86% relative humidity it was 4.8 min.92 All measurements made on rooms and houses have omitted a consideration of this problem , although it is partially expressed in the finding that in two separate buildings the outdoor concentration was reduced indoors to 15-20% in winter and to 40-50% in summer.93 At very high relative humidities , laboratory experiments suggest that each collision of a sulfur dioxide molecule with a wall results in its removal from the air.92 Very high humidities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Removal of sulfur dioxide by indoor surfaces is dominated by deposition to the ceiling , 91 ' 94 and as the surfaces within the building age , the proportion of sulfur dioxide removed from admitted outdoor air decreases.9 , 9s Aesthetic considerations usually dictate the renewal of indoor surfaces at frequent intervals by painting , wallpapering , etc. , so that a more reactive surface is provided and deposition again increases . Radioactive sulfur dioxide has been used in laboratory studies to assess the relative efficiencies of typical indoor surfaces in absorbing sulfur dioxide.96-99 Table 9 outlines the results of these experiments , which indicate that natural fibers and emulsion paint are particularly effective in removing sulfur dioxide from the air.100 An assessment of the relative area of each of the surfaces in a house suggests that emulsion-painted surfaces would remove about 70% of the sulfur dioxide admitted to indoor air.100 Emulsion paint is used largely for ceiling decoration , and thus the field observations of high uptake by ceilings is confirmed . The other major surface for the removal of sulfur dioxide indoors is furniture fabric because of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Carbon monoxide , nitrogen dioxide , and PAN concentrations indoors follow the outdoor air concentrations.89 ' 9 ? Carbon monoxide is certainly a relatively unreactive gas , and the reactivity of nitrogen dioxide and PAN must be sufficiently low for the inward diffusion of outside air to balance any removal by indoor surfaces . All three gases are efficiently removed from ventilating air by activated carbon filters.90 Although it has been presumed that the concentration gradient of pollu tant gases is from the outside to the inside air , it is possible for the reverse to occur . This is particularly the case with carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide , which may occur at quite high concentrations in indoor air through the faulty operation of gas cookers , gas heaters , and coal-fired furnaces.89 6.3 . Effects of Pollutant Gases on Indoor Surfaces At the concentrations found in polluted atmospheres , carbon monoxide does not have any effect on nonliving materials , and no effect is known for PAN , while it is possible that a long exposure to nitrogen dioxide could cause bleaching of some dyestuffs . Ozone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence dyestuffs that are susceptible to oxidation , but sulfur dioxide would appear to have the greatest damaging effects on indoor materi als . Unpainted stone and concrete masonry , mortar , and bricks absorb sulfur dioxide , resulting in the formation of sulfates.94 ' 101 Materials containing cal cium carbonate are especially affected by sulfate formation , since calcium sulfate has a greater molecular volume than calcium carbonate , leading to mechanical stress.102 This effect is particularly important in ancient buildings , where accelerated damage to frescos is becoming a serious problem.103 Fibers of nylon , 104 cotton , to5 and rayon ' 05 when exposed to 0.1 ? 0.2 ppm sulfur dioxide show a loss in mechanical strength thought to be due to acid hydrolysis , the acid arising from the absorption of sulfur dioxide in a water film on the surface of the fiber . In the form of papers , both cellulose and artificial Interaction of Gaseous Pollutants 239 fibers are degraded by very low concentrations of sulfur dioxide.96 ' " ' 6 The degradation is thought to be due both to acid hydrolysis and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lignosulfonic acids . Documents and books are particularly susceptible to attack by sulfur dioxide because of their long useful life . Even a very low concentration of sulfur dioxide becomes a high dosage when the time factor in the dosage parameter becomes large . Similarly , the leather bindings of books and documents are degraded by long exposures to low levels of sulfur dioxide . Once again , it is believed that the degradation is due to the formation of sulfuric acid in the surface water film , followed by acid hydrolysis.98 A number of techniques are available to reduce the damage of indoor materials by sulfur dioxide . The most obvious is the provision of air condition ing for all the air within the building by passing the ventilating air through an appropriate filter or scrubber . In real terms this technique is practicable only for large buildings . Books and documents may be protected by the choice of bindings and papers of low sulfur dioxide sorption capacity , ' 06 although the current trend is to store old and valuable books in air-conditioned buildings . In the private home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishing fabrics , wallpapers , etc. , before any sulfur dioxide damage makes itself obvious .
