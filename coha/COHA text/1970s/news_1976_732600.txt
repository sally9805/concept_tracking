txt TI1E FLOWERS that bloom in the spring are soon followed by tents that spring up in the summer as parties , trade shows , tournaments  --  events of all kinds  --  move outdoors to enjoy the balmy weather but with protection against the chance of rain . The white tent under which Queen Elizabeth will dine on the White House grounds July 7 ; the tent that sheltered Western Open Golf Championship contenders on the Butler National Golf Course this year ; the big one in Ravinia Park ; 40 others staked down at the Milwaukee Summer Festival ; and another 60 erected for the Festival of American Folk Life from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument in the Capitol ? they all have a common owner , HDO Productions of Highland Park . The firm , which in a dozen years grew from a local tent leasing company to a national one , became an international operation last summer , supplying a tent for the Paris Air Show . HDO 'S chairman , 35-year-old Harry D. Oppenheimer , and his wife , Huffy , personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College friends started in business , they never pictured themselves putting up a tent on the White House lawn . As students they were just earning summer money by supplying lighting , dance floors , entertainment , and car parking for North Shore parties . In 1963 , when it came time to decide what direction to take their fast-developing business , they decided on tents . Tents for private parties , social events , and corporate businesses are researched and tested in Highland Park and custom-made in Evansville , Ind. , by the Anchor Tent Co . They range from a 20-by-20-foot marquee that can be erected over a patio or in a garden as an " extra room " for weddings , bar mitzvahs , debuts , or other social entertaining , to a monster tent measuring 100 by 380 feet to shelter 6,000 persons . These innovative tent renters  --  who promise , " We specialize as producers of distinctive outdoor events " ? have even devised a portable auditorium big enough to house shows by manufacturers of heavy equipment . " IT 'S TOTALLY blacked out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shown . There 's seating for 1,500 , and a stage onto which heavy equipment can be driven . Behind that is a place for a display of vehicles . " The cost of renting the tent auditorium depends on the length of time it will be used and the difficulty of installation , but it usually runs about $25,000 . The company is excited about its new hyperbolic parabaloid tent , an aerodynamic design that creates a new feeling , " Oppenheimer says . It has a lot of height , and the modernistic-futuristic shape provides eye appeal for the design quality as well as for color . " It comes in solid red , yellow , blue , and white , and in two sizes . The smaller one , which rents for about $800 , is suitable for a dinner for 150 , or for a standup party of 200 persons . COSTS OF A new tent and the canvas that goes into it have risen steadily . Snythetic fibers are not used because the needle holes made in the sewing do not " heal " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes from one to eight weeks to make a new tent , depending on the size . - and I 've forgotten how many miles of thread and rope go into them , " Oppenheimer said . " Fire retardancy built into the cloth makes it more expensive , and labor has gone up . The 20-by-20 now costs Irons $1,000 to $1200 , and rents for $250 . " That includes installation . insurance the firm carries $10 million in general liability , and any attention or maintenance needed while the tent is in place , such as putting up or taking down - sides " in case of rain or wind , adding heaters , and making any other adjust . means Removal , of course , also is included . The 100-by-n00-foot tent rents for : , bout $10.000 , again depending on the difficulties of installation and the length of time it is up . SOCIAL OCCASIONS are a large part of the tent business , and HDO is prepared to go to any lengths the client will pay for to provide the conveniences and comforts of home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside Dallas , for instance , Oppenheimer workers provided powder rooms with mirrors and settees along with the portable toilets . The pace of social life in Washington keeps Jerry O'Connell , who learned the business during eight years with the firm in Highland Park . and his staff on their toes . The Washington ? branch of 100 provided lents for a dinner for Spain 's Juan Carlos and his Queen Sofia at the Spanish Embassy and has installed others for parties for Sweden 's King Carl : XVI Gustaf , the Duke of Marlborough , and the president of Botswanna . A branch was opened in Los Angeles last year , headed by Bill Haller , who was with the firm here for 10 years . CANVAS CAN BE flown to Nashville , Memphis , Atlanta , Miami  --  wherevitr needed  --  and size is no problem . Oppenheimer said . A 20-by-20-foot tent can be expanded simply by adding 10-foot additions at each end , as is being , done for the Harvey Kapnichs ' July 10 benefitgarden party for the Hadley School for t he Blind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . which is not unusual . HDO also supplies dance floors , lighting , and entertainment , works with caterers and decorators . HDO does not , however . park cars any more . The Andy Frain people do that . 1100 does not keep its tents from year to year . except for the auditorium . They 're sold after one season 's use schools , lodges , and religious groups . " Our customers expect first quality . " Oppenheimer explains . " Sap from the trees and sootfall around a city make the tents look older . " THERE ! LAVE been no disasters with LIDO tents . In fact . says Oppenheimer , " we hold up pretty well in storms . though there have been partial blow-downs in tornados . " Tents stand up better in tornados because they are more flexible than buildings with solid walls . Although tents can he heated in winter , air cooling is not very successful . The inside of a tent is already cooler than the outside , however , because the canvas blocks the sun . The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own sleeping bags " i at festivals , and has received calls for equipment in disasters as far away as Manila . 1100 canvas has p ... ; ected merchandise when warehou t , tireed , and tents have been used as ti ' iiiportiry restaurants for hotels damaged by tire . " WPM : A SERVICE organization . " Oppenheimer says . Ile. his longtime associate John Scallan. president of the company , and the account executives , as the salesmen arc called , all are in their thirties . The firm has 25 full-time employes . According to the swoon , workers increase to 70 or so , mtiny of them college students who work four . summers , then make room for younger scholars . All , including Oppenhelmer , are connected by " beepers " such as doctors wear on duty in hospitals to ensure prompt sere-ice . ' It 's a good busintis , " says the tent tycoon whose company bears his initials . " Everyone is iv it good mood . Part of the return is enjeyinent. "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
