AIOARD Air Force One on the flight back to Washington from San Clemente on the day after last week 's elections , President Nixon huddled with advisers to discuss the budget that he will send to Congress in January . Over the next few weeks , he will have to decide how much he dares to spend to get the economy moving faster . There is a good chance that he will let the budget drift into a big deficit for 1972 , even at the fearful risk of running a higher rate of inflation than he wants . <P> Economic issues , especially rising unemployment , hurt some Republicans severely in congressional and gubernatorial races . Unemployment now stands at 5.6% . The President knows that the economy must do better before he faces the voters again . He has pledged by mid-1972 to restore " full employment , " which his aides define as a jobless rate of about 4% . <P> Ways to Speed Up . The task will be formidable , if not impossible . Herbert Stein , a member of Nixon 's Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reached on schedule , real gross national product-not counting price increases-must grow at an annual rate of 6% . His estimate closely parallels the view of Democrat Walter Heller , a former CEA chairman . Said Heller last week : " I am happy to see that they are starting to catch up with our arithmetic . " The economy is far away from Stein 's goal . Real G.N.P . rose only 1.4% in this year 's third quarter , and it may decline in the current quarter if the General Motors strike drags on much longer . <P> There are two major ways to speed up the growth rate . The Government must either run a sizable budget deficit or rapidly expand the money supply by more than 7% annually . The Federal Reserve Board has been pumping the money out at a 4% to 5% rate this year . It would probably be willing to increase that rate substantially only if Nixon tried to contain the inflationary effects by adopting an " incomes policy " - some form of wage-price guidelines , or at least direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea has been steadily gaining among private business leaders and even reluctant Government policymakers . Nixon , however , has consistently rejected the notion as unworkable , almost sinful and certainly inimical to free-market principles . <P> The President 's best device for pepping up the economy seems to be the budget . Aides say that he will send to Congress a fiscal 1972 budget with a planned deficit-amount uncertain-to follow the unplanned deficit of about $15 billion that the Government is likely to run this fiscal year . That will be distasteful for a Republican President , especially Nixon . He has consistently , and correctly , blamed inflation on the deficit run up by Lyndon Johnson . Administration officials are bandying about ideas for making the deficit look smaller than they expect it really to be . Treasury leaders , for example , are urging the President to propose a " value-added " tax-a complex kind of sales tax widely used in Europe-and to include the revenues that it would produce in his budget estimates . Almost no one in Washington thinks that Congress would pass such a tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
