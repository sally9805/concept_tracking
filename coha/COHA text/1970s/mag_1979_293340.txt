" Only the skeleton remained before Fabian ... Above all other abandoned , useless and decaying parts of the dead horse 's body , the skeleton bothered Fabian most . Unlike the animal 's skin or blood , the intestines , lungs , nerves or muscles , each a forge of moisture and heat , a furnace of life , the skeleton , with its two hundred and more bones that Fabian had once counted , seemed no more complex than the crude pillars , posts , joints and frames that made up the barn - and no more mysterious . <P> If the skeleton was the bony soul , the hardened essence of the horse , it appeared , when juxtaposed with the living mass of the animal , rather as its opposite , a caricature supplanting pliancy with rigor , fluency with brittleness , motion with stillness . What would have happened to the horse , Fabian wondered , if , throughout its life , instead of relying on its instinct , the animal had sought support only from its skeleton ?
