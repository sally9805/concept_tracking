At 8:30 on the evening before his address to Congress , President Carter huddled with his energy team in the White House Cabinet Room . Dressed in blue jeans and sipping ice water , Carter worried over each point in his message with Energy Aide James Schlesinger ( TIME cover , April 4 ) and a handful of key staffers . Rosalynn stopped by to eye the text . " If I can understand it , everybody can , " she explained later . " We changed a word here and there to be more easily understood . " At 12:45 a.m. , a weary President went off to work on the speech for another hour before going to bed . Schlesinger and his small staff retreated to their offices , where the staff worked all night putting the finishing touches on the address and the Administration 's proposed legislation . <P> Despite the last-minute wording revisions and a few substantive changes ( gasoline taxes will be rebated to consumers by reducing their income tax , not their Social Security tax as had been contemplated earlier ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been reported ( TIME cover , April 25 ) and previewed in his Monday night speech . In essence , the President hopes to arrest growing U.S. fuel demand through conservation , and to rely on plentiful coal and conventional nuclear energy to stretch out supplies of oil and natural gas until new forms of energy ( solar , geothermal and thermonuclear fusion ) become the nation 's major power resources in the next century . <P> That is a commendable-indeed , indispensable-goal . But some of Carter 's chosen methods are debatable . The program largely bypasses the supply and demand workings of a free economy . Instead , the presidential plan relies heavily on rewards and penalties , to be dealt out mainly through a complex scheme of taxes and rebates . " Voluntary compliance is not enough , " said Carter . " The problem is too large and the time is too short . " Major items : <P> GASOLINE . The Government would set consumption targets providing for a gradual rise in usage until 1980 , then a decline after 1982 . If U.S. motorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1% more gasoline than the target , then the next year they will have to pay a federal tax of 5 per gal. ; the tax could rise to a maximum of 50 by 1989 . Any money raised by the tax-and it could eventually be as much as $60 billion a year - would be returned , said the White House , not just to drivers but in equal amounts " to every man , woman and child in America " through income tax credits and direct payments to people who do not owe taxes . The credits and payments would function as a kind of income redistribution device . Lower-income people , who usually do not drive as much as those in higher brackets , would pay less in gasoline taxes but receive the same rebates . <P> GAS GUZZLERS AND SIPPERS . Washington will penalize buyers of gas-thirsty cars and reward purchasers of fuel-efficient autos , through a complex formula of excise taxes and rebates keyed to gas mileage . For example , in 1978 a $449 tax would be slapped on autos achieving 12 m.p.g. ; by 1985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1978 a buyer of a car getting 39 m.p.g. would receive a rebate of $473 ; by 1985 the rebate would rise slightly , to $493.
