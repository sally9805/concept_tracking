Bordered by quietly elegant homes and supported by a highly exclusive membership , the West Side Tennis Club of Forest Hills , N.Y. , is a bastion of bourgeois gentility . Last week its manicured grounds were savaged by an intruder from the socialist East , a lank-haired and slightly mad lieutenant of the Rumanian army named Ilie Nastase , 26 . Flying about the grass courts like an impassioned Gypsy dancer , Nastase came from behind to defeat Arthur Ashe of Richmond 3-6 , 6-3 , 6-7 , 6-4 , 6-3 and win the U.S. Open championship . His reward : a check for $25,000 and a stylish Pinto station wagon that should be the talk of Bucharest . <P> Nastase 's mercurial style , on and off the court , has become a topic of controversy in U.S. tennis . " Ilie is a heck of a player , " Ashe conceded at the championship awards ceremony , but added : " When he brushes up on his manners , he 'll be an even better player . " Nastase , standing near by , responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his forehead . But later he displayed a saving touch of remorse : " Arthur is my good friend . I am upset that he said something bad , but maybe he was nervous too . Everyone was nervous . " <P> Everyone who plays against Nastase usually is . Early in the match , Ilie began to get on Ashe 's nerves by protesting the linesmen 's eyesight and judgment with baroque Balkan-and some internationally known-gestures . Irked by a footfault call , he dropped his racket in disbelief . Later , convinced that a service linesman had robbed him on an out call , Nastase threw a towel toward the official and whacked a ball at him . Such unseemly pique drew boos from the crowd and a rebuke from Ashe , who complained to the umpire . <P> Default . That was not the first time Nastase has annoyed his fellow touring pros . In Paris last December he used similar antics to needle Cliff Richey into flubbing a match . A month later Nastase ran into an American with a temperament equal to his own : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graebner leaped over the net and grabbed Nastase . Order was restored and the set completed , but the rattled Rumanian then walked off the court and defaulted the match . <P> While some of Nastase 's comrades are less than enthusiastic about his behavior , no one denies his talent . " Ilie 's best shot , " says Ashe , " is his athletic ability . He 's so fast with his feet and hands . " Nastase , the son of a bank cashier , began to display that ability at the age of eight on Bucharest 's slow clay courts . As his career soared he teamed with glowering Ion Tiriac to make Rumania a formidable threat* in big-league tennis . Before last week , Nastase was acknowledged as the world 's best on clay . His victory over Ashe-coupled with his close battle against U.S. Champion Stan Smith at Wimbledon last July-proves that he is a top contender for the position last held by Rod Laver : the game 's premier player on any surface . <P> <P> *Rumania will meet the U.S. next month in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
