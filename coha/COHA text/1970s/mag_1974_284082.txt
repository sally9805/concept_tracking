When Financier Robert Vesco fled the U.S. to avoid his mounting legal problems , he took along a prized possession : a Boeing 707 jetliner lavishly fitted out with a dis cotheque , a sauna for five and sleeping quarters for twelve . Vesco may have thought his expensive toy was safe , but one of his more determined creditors reckoned otherwise . In what may turn out to be one of the most bizarre asset-recovery schemes on record , Alwyn Eisenhauer , Vesco 's former pilot , settled a beef against his old boss simply by talking his way aboard the plane , then flying it home . <P> A garrulous former Navy fighter pilot , Eisenhauer claims that he is owed $55,000 in back pay , crew salaries and expenses by the plane 's owner , Fairfield General Corp. , a New Jersey firm that had been part of Vesco 's corpo rate empire . Eisenhauer had a bold plan to recover Fairfield General 's principal asset-Vesco 's 707-and he took it to the company 's receivers . They in turn took the idea to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to liquidate Fairfield General . After a few discreet phone calls located the plane at Panama City 's Tocumen International Airport , the judge authorized Fairfield General to advance Eisenhauer $17,500 on his claim . The pilot then headed for Panama with two colleagues . <P> At Tocumen , Eisenhauer finagled his way into a meeting with Panama 's director of civil aviation , who turned out to be another ex-fighter pilot . Eisenhauer convinced his new-found friend that he did indeed represent the plane 's owners and had come to take the plane to the U.S. for maintenance . <P> Few questions were asked , particularly after Eisenhauer shelled out what he claims was $2,500 for landing fees , parking bills and other charges against the plane . Intriguingly , Panamanian officials say the tab was only $1,910.50 . <P> However much it cost , Eisenhauer and his crew hurriedly took the plane to Newark , where it was immediately impounded by sheriffs deputies on Judge Kimmelman 's orders . <P> The State Department expressed outrage at the caper , which may have violated international law . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from Fairfield General 's receivers . Under longstanding law , the plane , worth perhaps $3.5 million , can now be legally sold to satisfy debts , no matter how it reached the U.S. Judge Kimmelman happily accepted a small red bag containing vital engine parts from Eisenhauer last week . <P> The parts were removed to immobilize the plane , just in case someone tried to repeat Eisenhauer 's stunt in the other direction .
