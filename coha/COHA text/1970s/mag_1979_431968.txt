 | In China We arrived in China in the fall of 1978 , precisely at a moment when for the first time in at least twenty years people felt safe enough to talk freely to foreigners about what had been happening over the past decades . We were prepared to deal with the dissimulations of any one-party society and the usual police surveillance of our movements . We found ourselves instead among people who were clearly throwing off a veil of not only outer control but inner censorship , people who were insisting on the most excruciating sort of honesty , and on telling about their own and others ' suffering under the so-called " Gang of Four " ( which , one soon learned , was a screen for the still sacrosanct name of Mao ) . For myself , I had expected to observe , but I had not thought I was to be educated not merely in things Chinese but in matters of social principle which underlie the dilemmas of the American and European societies . Our interests in China , it must be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inge Morath there was initially the challenge of learning the language and adding it to the half-dozen others in which she is fluent or , like Rumanian , in which she has a working knowledge . The calligraphy led her to Chinese art and from art to history . After four years of intense study she greeted 91 Su Kuang , our Chinese interpreter , at the Peking Airport in his own language and they shared a delighted astonishment that she was so completely understood . For me , China was primarily a political and social revolution I had followed since the thirties when the names of Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai and Chu Teh were like flares shot into the sky out of a human sea , a Hitherto silent mass of people suddenly defying the Japanese fascists and prophesying the dawn of reason and liberty in Asia . For a while I had had the friendship , too , of Edgar Snow , who would stop by to pick up his soon-to-be wife , Lois Wheeler , after her performances in my play All My Sons . His Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ever read and surely among the most influential ever writ:en , seemed at the time to promise a new stage of human development , a Marxist revolution whose leaders had a sense of humor , irony , and , in Chou 's case , a cultivated sensibility one had never associated with : heir kind in the Soviet Union . I must admit , however , that in recent years I had all gut given up hope of understanding what was happening in China . Under a barrage of factional leaders ' names , which I could never remember , and their conflicting claims , which often had the confused stridencies of Talmudic sectarianism , I had left Chinese politics to the Chinese . And it was just as well . I discovered , for I arrived quite without preconceived notions on the merits of any of the arguing sides . The China of 1978 is the Pyrrhic triumph of factionalism , but of an intensity beyond the capacity of mortal mind to follow . The mazelike complexity of events , moreover , had been compounded even for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative " happenings , so that a devastating fight could have occurred a short distance from Peking with few who were not eyewitnesses knowing about it . And some of these factional fights killed people in the tens of thousands . What is difficult to comprehend in Chinese factionalism , apart from its sheer density , is that this traditional curse of the left could flower , cross-pollinate , wind its endless branches around the pillars of the state and pull it all crashing to the ground ? while the state power itself either stood apart , merely remonstrating , as Mao would from time to time , or entered the fray as one of the factions itself . This is not conceivable , I suppose , in any other country . So a contradiction must be admitted : that while China 's government operated , as it still does , in the usual secrecy of any communist regime , it at the same time carried on a sort of yelling debate with sects and factions within and below it in the Party to the point where , strictly speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and the field was left to terror and brute force . To seek the nuggets of principle in these factions is probably pointless , for , as William Hinton has demonstrated in his book The Hundred Day War , the battles begun in principle to " support Mao " were finally allowed to degenerate into the classical clashes of power-lusting young men whose forces often separated into three , four , or more subgroups , each of which had its share of paranoids , and which in the end could only combine through a common love for falling stones . Inge Morath 's photographs ever testifying to the lasting , the beautiful , the evidences of history 's grace are not mere scenery here , however they may please the eye . They are in their loveliness one arm of China 's contradiction ? her ancientness and solemnity which ceaselessly work against and with her epic struggle to change at last and become a modern nation . But this is not an article about the Cultural Revolution , which , like the Thirty Years ' War in Europe , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand different conclusions . It is a personal witness , neither more nor less , to the collapse of an orthodoxy at the moment when the faithful emerged from the fallen temple with blinking eyes , trying to make out ordinary objects in the no longer charmed , unearthly light of ordinary days . It was the moment when the great choirs of the worshippers were stilled , when the mountains had ceased to dance ( as some insist they did ) , when Necessity once again refused all rhapsodic persuasions and would yield only to accountants and engineers and the kinds of people who may get things done but can never believe in what they can not touch and see . This too will pass into yet newer permutations . But for two people , well disposed and trying to see and listen , here is a bit of how it was at the particular moment when the dust of the temple began to settle . I. Down With the Gang of Four One learns soon enough that only a fool understands the Chinese quickly . Nevertheless , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic curiosity about our American lives had deftly ripped the veil between us as citizens of two mutually isolated nations . Chiao , in his forties , is a poet and playwright whose delicacy of manner never varied through the eight hours of each day we were together . He showed surprise only when he caught himself laughing . And it took some studying to realize that the look in his sadly humorous eyes , as he listened to Inge reading lines from a book of T'ang poetry in Chinese , was one of deep admiration . Indeed , I found that he was studying her sometimes as if she were a visitor from another galaxy . One morning the three of us , along with our guide ,  | Su Kuang , who was limping a bit less after applying some American athlete 's foot medicine which I had forced upon him , descended a broad stairway four stories into the earth . We entered the gray cut-stone arched vaults , some two stories high , which for centuries had concealed the treasures of the Ming emperors ' tombs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and one or two immense thrones of dragon-embossed stone far too heavy to move . Two dutiful young women , wrapped like Andalusian shepherdesses in black cloaks against the dampness , forlornly presided over the tourists and the gloom . Still , there was something imperial in the sheer weight of the stone overhead , so carefully set in place to guard the great dead and their treasure against thieves and the Mings ' political enemies . Out in the sunshine again I asked the playwright how the recently excavated tombs happened to have been found . " The emperor had left a stone , " he explained , " which described their exact location , and this stone was found not long ago . Although the general location has always been vaguely known . " Sensing an amusing paradox , I said , " He went to all that expense to keep the treasures hidden and safe , but his ego could n't bear for people never to admire them . " Both men gave me a startled look . " So you were led to his tombs by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . " That is very clever ! " said Chiao Yu , a man not easily driven to laughter , but it was his being so stirred by this fairly obvious paradox that intrigued me . The same was happening to Su Kuang , whose moods by now we had come to understand , and when in the next few minutes both returned to this remark of mine again and again , it seemed there was something more involved here than the emperor and his tombs . It occurred to me , as it would with other Chinese later on , that what was so strange was deducing a leader 's character from his public acts . It is not that leaders may have no individual personalities but that Power has none , and as Marxists the people have been trained to regard those at the top purely as voices or expressions of economic and political forces , mainly the class struggle . That a leader 's personal vanity could have had such grand consequences was a fundamentally inadmissible idea , but that they recognized it , like some long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward laughter of recognition , the laughter of an irony perceived . ( They remain a classical people , like our own Aeschylean Greeks , for what @# still interests them is less the gossip about characte their idiosyncracies , than their impact upon the pub : fate . ) Nevertheless , there was an uneasiness with this kind of psychologizing of historical events , and the rea for their resistance to it was about to clear up . Fri. our first hour in China my wife and I were regaled pelted , bathed , swabbed , would be better words -- with the depredations of the Gang of Four . After the in .. shock it almost began to seem funny to be blaming the ills of a country of nearly one billion on three and one woman , and it was hard to take absolute seriously . From the paucity of contemporary plays . - films , to the condition of public transport , to hermetic ignorance of any world outside China , it s ' all the doing of this manic faction of the Central Committee , which , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeterminate time in the past was brought to book only by the Party 's then chairman , Hua Kuo-feng , who arrested the vile quart : - two and a half years ago and with his own group assumed the leadership . Notwithstanding Soviet revilement of Trotsky , such open condemnation of even rejected leaders in a communist country was odd indeed , especially since what Chiang Ching , Mao 's wife , and her cohorts were charged with was not merely strategic errors but a personal moral rottenness which is not supposed to afflict even mistaken Marxists so long in power . To hear Chiao Yu , as well as other writers , directors , and actors , tell it , Chiang Ching had behaved more like a bitterly vengeful aging actress than a political leader of the world 's largest nation . For example , a host of Shanghai theater and movie folk were arrested in the seventies for no other reason than that they knew of her checkered past as a Shanghai actress , and it was believed that she had sold herself to the hated Kuomintang 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thirties . It was turning out much as a Canadian reporter had predicted on our first day in Peking . " They 're going to blame everything that 's wrong with the country on the Four . I was at a banquet recently and sat down on a chair that collapsed , and as I hit the floor I looked out at the audience and yelled , Gang of Four ! ' and they all died laughing . " Nevertheless , if only as a symbol of a tyrannical decade , the Gang of Four represents anarchy , an assault upon reason , and the cause of the stubborn backwardness of the country . And so I asked Chiao Yu whether thought was being given on any level of the government to preventing another wild faction from seizing power in the future . It ought to be said that Chinese now , despite a very obvious embarrassment and pain , are willing to face such a question along with  | the fact that they have been supinely faithful to petty tyrants , and worse yet , in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are nearly alone among citizens of socialist states in their willingness to discuss publicly not only the system 's successes but its crippling failures . " Many of us are asking ourselves the same question , " Chiao Yu replied . " Do you have any answers ? " Again it was clear he was loath to continue but would anyway . " We thought she was speaking for Chairman Mao , you see . We did not know how sick he was in the last years of his life . " " And of course she held onto the power after his death . " " Yes , she did . " " Is it difficult for you now to confront those years ? " He glanced away , then willed himself to look at me . He was embarrassed . " Yes , it is difficult . " We were cruising slowly along the sunlit surface of the shallow Kun Ming Lake at the Peking Summer Palace . Fish were leaping out of the water beside the boat . On a small table between us was a plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Friendship Association . We were moving parallel to a high masonry wall that had once surrounded the city four centuries ago . Indeed , the last empress had rebuilt this park and lake , which had nearly been snatched away from the people again by a new ruling lady . For Chiang Ching , incredibly , had shut the park to the public and used it as her private preserve . It was still early in our Chinese voyage and I did not yet know what I would know soon : Chinese , like the French , have little interest in traveling abroad since their country is the center of the world . It is always drought , flood , famine , some desperate circumstance that sends them out of China , rarely curiosity . I asked Chiao Yu , " Do you get to see much foreign literature ? " " Yes , a little . " " Any American ? " " We have one book in the Writers Union translated from America . " " Which is that ? " " Jonathan Seagull . But so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . " " That 's the only recent American book translated ? " " I have also read Love Story . What do you think of those books ? " It was impossible to tell from his expression whether he wanted a compliment on the Chinese having translated these books or a confirmation of his own low opinion of them . " They 're all right , " I said , " but we have better ones . " He nodded , still neutrally . " Why were those books selected for translation , do you know ? " " Because they were so popular . It was thought that they would help us to understand the Americans . " " Ah . " " Yes . " " Do you feel you learned something from them ? " He shrugged , blinked at the air . " It is difficult to say , it is all so far from us . " " I suppose you have Jack London ? " I figured the Russians would have seen to that , he having been their favorite American social novelist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hemingway ? " Chiao Yu glanced uncertainly toward Su Kuang , who rendered the name in its Chinese pronunciation . " There was Old Man and the Sea many years ago , yes . " " Faulkner , I suppose . " Su Kuang now asked me to spell it and then pronounced it " Faulk-i-nuh " for Chiao Yu , who , however , had never heard of him or Steinbeck or , as it turned out , any other American writer . In Chiao Yu 's mild eyes I could see the United States floating far , far off somewhere in the vicinity of the Milky Way . " We have Balzac . " " He 's French . " " Yes . " But no English writers or any other foreigners  | except Chekhov and Tolstoy ; not Dostoevsky , although he had heard of the name . I was astounded by the ignorance of this writer facing me across the soda pop and the apples and candy on this lovely afternoon , until an old joke about the English passed through my mind , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continent Isolated . " How many Chinese writers did I know , free as I was to read anything ? And had he not a better right than Ito provincial sequestration when there were going on one billion Chinese , a quarter of the human race , while there were only two hundred million or so Americans ? In fact , he had more compatriots than the populations of Europe , Russia , and half of India combined . Who was the provincial ? I thought about this a long time and decided that he was , primarily because he clearly thought so too . " We are far behind , " he finally said . " We have n't enough translators yet from any of the languages , and in the last years everything foreign has been either forbidden or made to seem dangerous . " But then he appeared to feel he may have been too sweeping . " But we have just published a translation of Peer Gynt , " he recalled . I tried to look congratulatory . We were now drifting toward the shore where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure built of stone , a " marvel " conceived by the last empress around the turn of the century . It is two stories high and with its paddle wheel resembles a Mississippi steamboat . The empress built it with money that had been appropriated for a navy to resist foreigners . In a sense she did the right thing , for at least China has this park and the Marble Boat to show for money that would not have deflected the power of Japan or the West for a single week . 2 . Street Meetings As guests of the Friendship Association we travel alone , not in a group , but with our hardworking guide-interpreter Su Kuang by our side . To lighten long train rides and those inevitable longueurs during interminable auto tours on bad roads , I can kid Su about his naps . He is a civilized man of thirty-two and expects any human who can possibly do so to drop off for a few minutes after lunch . It is my opinion that he should cut out the naps , or the Four Modernizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defense ? will be delayed by at least another generation . It takes Su a couple of days to interpret my signals , but with Inge 's help he is finally reassured that I am not being serious , and by the second week of our time together he is even cracking a few mildly satirical jokes of his own at my expense . It is worth pointing out that with a Su Kuang at 94 one 's side there is no suspicion whatever of his secret being a policeman . For one thing , Inge can and doeget the car to stop unexpectedly anywhere along t streets and roads when she sees something to pho : graph , some of it not at all flattering to a country cageto show its best face or conceal its worst . Thrown together as we are with Su for twelve hours a day , life becomes less and less formal among us . To some degree we inevitably see the country through his eyes , and China gradually becomes less dramatic , less incongruous , a bit more repetitious , and consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , boasting is not one of them , and , in 197. neither is that time-honored and ludicrous mendaciousness of government guides whenever a perfectly evident failing of their system arises . For example , it we who are enthusiastic about the hundreds of people we see everywhere , in courtyards and on the street before public buildings where they are about to enteto work , exercising with the Tai Chi method . Whole troops of office workers can be seen on sidewalks staring into space as they visualize clouds and vaporwhich , with slow and gracefully tensed hands , the attempt to shape and move from place to place , at the same time bending the trunk and legs and turning . twisting , stretching . But Su Kuang is not an exerciser. and regardless of the credit it may give his country , he would rather remain seated if at all possible . It is I who note that bicycles seem to be parked almost anywhere without chains and padlocks , while Su is sorry to have to tell me that they are in fact locked across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not infrequently stolen . Moreover , near supermarkets or other gathering places , old ladies keep watch on parked bikes for a small tip . I t there is nothing like the volume of thievery that exists in New York , no opportunity is lost to hang a padlock where it will do the most good . And it is Su Kuang who informs us ? after I have noted how clean the people seem " Well , some of them are not so clean . But it is hard to keep clean . " " No hot water ? " " No bathtubs . " This piece of news slightly alters the picturesqueness of the cold-water tap one usually sees in Peking courtyards , especially when one thinks of January and February . . . Over the days it becomes clear that if Su has not formally been ordered to speak the truth , he nevertheless understands it is his duty , even at times when it is a bit painful to do so . One must inevitably read into his honesty a political footnote of sorts , for if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of backwardness , he would have had no choice but to obey . And it is he , not I , who uses the word " backward . " @#  | The result of this candor is that , with such as he , one is aside the well-known tendency to shout for lack of means to express nuances . It is dishonesty that eater our barriers far more than cultural differences r even language ; it is the defensiveness of political stems trying to feign success not only to foreigners ut fundamentally to themselves . Su 's parents are dead ; his mother died only last year , f cancer , and just when he was guiding a group of American cancer specialists through a tour . His family %ere peasants and he is the only one of five or six children who went to higher schools . In the midst of ne crowd near the Sun Yat-sen Memorial in Nanking n National Day , their Fourth of July , I wonder if any peasants have come into town to celebrate . " There are peasants all around us right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens of people who are clustering around Inge , fascinated by her many slung cameras . They are all dressed precisely the same , of course , in he Sun Yat-sen jacket ( misnamed the Mao jacket abroad ) . " How can you tell ? " I ask . " The ones with dark skins . Like mine . " " You mean it 's genetic ? " " I guess so ? I 'm not in the sun very much , but I 'm till dark . " We are at the foot of the thousand-step stairway hich flows down from the Sun Yat-sen Memorial , and now Su learns , with what can only be described as excruciating happiness , that I intend to sit down with him and novelist Ai-hsuen and let Inge and a local interpreter ascend by themselves . ( In each city protocol requires a local interpreter to accompany us regardless of Su 's presence . ) The stone benches bordering the stairway are either wholly or partly occupied , and as I look about for a place and suggest we sit on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Make room , please , for this foreign friend of China . " At that the three , two young men and a middle-aged woman with her fiveear-old child in hand , instantly stand up and nod happily to me , as though I am the one doing the favor , and , gesturing for me to sit down , walk off into the dense crowd which ceaselessly descends from the memorial . The charm of this performance is disturbed by an uneasy sense of its unreality , to say nothing of its unfairness . It attaches itself to a string of earlier incidents which jangle together in the mind . For one , Su is not allowed to eat with us , his charges , but joins his fellow Chinese in a separate hotel dining room , unless his presence as interpreter is required . And while he never complains , his food is not as good or as varied and interesting as ours . There is also the question of the army guard one @# sometimes ? although not always ? sees at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bayonet fixed . Usually a very young soldier , he crisply salutes all incoming cars , and in response to my asking what the man is guarding , Su shrugs and is at a loss . " Probably a leftover from the past , " he says , dismissing it . But , back home after our China trip , we meet a young San Francisco-born Chinese girl whose cousin had a curious experience with such a guard . The cousin had bought herself a standard Sun Yat-sen jacket and trousers , a " set " as it is called , and after trying it on in her hotel had tied her hair in pigtails , as so many Chinese girls do , and had gone out of the hotel . When , later , she returned and started up the front steps , a guard suddenly appeared , pushed her away , and when she protested , called her names and asked who the hell she thought she was coming off the street into a fine hotel like this . Unfortunately she had left her U.S. passport in her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an overseas Chinese , after which the guard nervously apologized . If foreigners are free to photograph and move about , not quite at random but with relative freedom , there is evidently still some distance to travel before the bars go all the way down for the right of Chinese to do the same . By all accounts , however , it is only in the past year or so that even foreigners have been allowed so long a leash , so perhaps the improvement can be expected to continue until it reaches the natives . One unexpected proof of this recently altered state of affairs occurred on our first morning in China , when we decided to go for a walk through Peking back streets alone , before Su Kuang picked us up after breakfast . At about seven-thirty that fine autumn morning we left the hotel and simply turned corners at random . At this early stage of our trip , the poverty of the houses struck me powerfully ; except for the brick- instead-of-adobe construction , one might be in a backwater Mexican town . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of timidity or fear in their stares at us . The smell of burning carbon from their cookstoves , the low-lying and often beautifully shaped , boatlike roofs , mixed an air of serenity with the decrepitude of the structures . That there was no smell of sewage or the usual fetid stenches of poverty was at odds with the visual evidence of crowding . There was no sense of civic demoralization , if the eye and nose can judge such things . Suddenly , out of a narrow alleyway , a man appeared , pushing his bicycle ; he was an old man , surely in his mid-seventies , with stringy white whiskers and , unusually enough , his tunic collar carelessly unbuttoned . He looked as though he had just jumped out of bed and was late , but seeing us , he halted at the opening of his little alley and seemed about to fly apart in astonishment . His lips began to tremble and his eyes teared . Inge began to offer him a Chinese " good morning " ? her first public attempt to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in halting but reasonable English , who we were , where we were from , and what we were doing here of all places , slowly gathering his wits under a barrage of feelings that were all variations of delight . " Imagine ! " he called out breathlessly . " Finding you people here , right out on the street ! And being able to speak to you like this ! " We were still so new in China that his astonishment was hard to understand . " But even a year ago I would n't have dared come up to you like this ? even if they 'd let you go around alone . . . No , no , not the police , the neighbors would have had me in all kinds of trouble . " And he glanced around challengingly at the huddle of houses on his little street , as though hoping one of the neighbors would see him out there talking to us legally . " We 've been hounded for years , you see . . . this awful fear and hatred of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now . . . " He beamed . " Here we are ! And we can talk about anything at all ! " He had studied English in Japan in the thirties , like many Chinese in that time , and was so eager to see us again that we made a date to meet with him in our hotel that evening . We found him when we returned at the end of the day , sitting erectly in one of the overstuffed chairs on our floor and looking at us reproachfully as we walked over to him . " You are late , " he said , quite abruptly . In fact , we had forgotten all about him , and we apologized for the half-hour we had made him wait . He relented , but only slowly , and got down to business , offering to act as our guide through China . He could drop everything , he said , and begin tomorrow morning . 96 What was surprising was not his eye for business adventure or both , but that he could live only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot where foreigners by the hundreds came and w constantly , always accompanied by Chinese guid and yet have no awareness that we could not improv some private arrangement with him . Once again . trivial as this instance might have been , a certa imponderable sense arose from it of an individual isolation , something cut off in each person ? in this case an alert and intelligent old man . Though we invited him to come the following evening , he never showed up . But to return to our newly won seat beside the vast stairs leading up to Sun Yat-sen 's memorial : we three men gratefully relax on the bench and wave goodbye to Inge and the local interpreter as they melt into the crowd climbing upward toward the sky-blue roof of the seemingly mile-high memorial building . With the temperature so perfect , in the mid-seventies , and a light breeze blowing , I find myself regretting the unisex drabness of the women 's unvarying trouserstunic sets . " Su , old buddy , " I say , " one of these days in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a lot of these people are girls . " He is on to me by this time and pretends to be outraged . " Of course they are girls . We know that . " " How about letting them wear skirts sometimes ? " " It 's not the season . " " But it 's a warm day . " " Yes , but it 's October . " " No skirts after September ? " " Not usually , no . It 's just a fashion . " " Well , I wo n't argue . But it 's very discouraging .

" 3 " The Pure in Heart Need No Lawyers " In Peking only four days , I feel the intense need to talk to someone about the law , a subject in which no one in China seems to have the least interest . ( In fact , however , within two weeks of our departure from China there were demands voiced in demonstrations and on wall posters that the leadership adopt a new attitude of respect for legality . ) Surely if I were Chinese and did not wish to see my country losing another decade or two to anarchy , and more important ,  | did not wish to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look to the law for at least some reassurance that the past would not return . But China has still not yet passed a legal code . ' The Party has the power to punish or let pass whatever it deems harmful or helpful to its rule , and worse yet , can change back and forth at will . It is government not by law but by political resolution , something understandable in a revolution 's early stages but questionable , to say the least , after nearly thirty years of existence . There is a constitution , of course , but this can not be more than a guide if beneath it there exists no body of laws designed to make its provisions universally applicable . Sid Shapiro came to China in the early forties , has lived here since , and is a Chinese citizen . In his sixties now , he translates from English and is fluent in Chinese . He studied at " the subway law school , " St. John 's University in Brooklyn , and was raised a few blocks from my family home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet part of Peking , is close by an artificial lake , and the neighborhood is rather suburban in its somnolence this midmorning . As is the case in some parts of Brooklyn , it is hard to find a passerby who knows where his street is , though we are only three blocks away , and as our driver squeezes down one narrow lane after another I find myself staring out at the mamas and babies and grandmas and grandpas padding around the neighborhood ? carrying a chair or a package or looking for a key on the ground ? just being people , and 1 experience a vain longing for the day when it will be possible , perhaps a thousand years hence , to govern people by leaving them alone . As Inge talks with his Chinese wife ( Shapiro Taitai ) , a former actress and now a drama critic , my fellow Brooklynite corrects my vision of things here . " No , they do n't need lawyers , " he explains . " At least only very rarely , hardly ever at all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas as he is with his Hopje candy ( it has a Chinese name here ) , reminding me of Brooklyn where this formerly Dutch , coffee-flavored sweet was the dentist 's best friend . " Where the hell 'd you get Hopjes ? " I ask . " They do n't know they 're Hopjes , " he confides , " they just make them . But are n't they terrific ? " We sit there chewing away in his rather somber living room . He recently went back to Brooklyn to see his family , but after an absence of thirty years all he found impressive in America was the fear of crime . @# " They were worried as hell that I was going back to Manhattan on the subway at midnight . I could n't believe it ; imagine being afraid to go out of your house ! " " No fear here ? " " Not for a minute . These people are members ( ! society . " " But do n't they ever get out of line ? " He settles back and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpeel paper from our Hopjes . I c. : - see him clearly in Depression Brooklyn , cramming h courses , getting good grades , turning his face from failed economy and feeding his soul on the communist . ideal of effortless justice . For injustice is not an inclination of humanity but something imposed by unjust conditions . Man is not only by nature good , he is most often Chinese . Sid got out of the United States before McCarthyism took over , no doubt because he had analyzed the future and found nothing but American crisis and decline while China was climbing upward and building the world he dreamed of . " As Mao said , there are two kinds of contradictions : among the people , and between the people and the enemy . The courts do n't involve themselves with the first kind of trouble . . . " " Let 's say a kid smashes a window , a guy beats up his wife . " " That kinda stuff never gets into a court . " " What about cops ? " " Rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the kid and his parents to straighten him out . The peer pressure can weigh fifty tons . " " Like in Brooklyn . " Shapiro hesitates to agree ? there should be nothing in China like anything in America . " I mean , " I continue , " that families were really the main source of discipline in those times . " " Well , in a way , " he agrees , politely rather than actually , " but here the pressure is not just sentimental . it 's based on political principle . " " To beat your wife is anticommunist . " And I suddenly think of a line in a Depression play by Clifford Odets : " A man who beats his wife is the first step to Fascism . " " You could put it that way , sure . But beating a woman is political , since it cuts across the Party 's position on women 's equality ; it 's a feudal throwback . " " Gotcha . " " Stuff like that . " We both laugh at the revival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they do with hard cases ? " " There are n't that many . " " But there have to be some . " " Well , in that case he goes before a judge and two  | laymen who know the defendant . And they struggle with him to reform his ideas . Crime is basically political , the result of reactionary ideas . " " Give me an example . Take theft . " " Okay . Theft is the attempt to consume goods witht working or producing , so it is antisocialist and - erefore a political act . " " That 's very good . " I am impressed . " So political means are the only ones that can cure " In other words , instead of moral inhibitions . . . " " Which mostly do n't work , " he quickly adds . " Why do n't they work ? " " Because under capitalism you 've got enormous crowds that do n't have anything , while a few have a ot . " " So , in a sense , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And even morally correct . They are righting injustice . But , " he cautions , " you ca n't graft the Chinese . vstem onto America because it is based on a just economy . You can blame a man for stealing when he as a job and the chance to eat , but you ca n't if he 's nemployed and starving . " It is the socialist lesson I first learned in Depression Brooklyn days , but Sid clearly delivers it like late news , and I find myself both marveling and irritated at the windless space he occupies , where in truth nothing has penetrated in forty years . " But you really do n't feel anyone needs to be defended once he 's in trouble ? " There is a certain smidge of defensiveness , though not enough to tip over his rice bowl . " But why ? Before anybody 's accused , the investigation is absolutely fair and thorough , and it goes on for weeks . Believe me , people who are n't guilty are never accused . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . " " There ca n't even have been a case of mistaken iden-tity ? " " Well , maybe one in ten thousand , but that 's not a real problem to the point where you 'd have to introduce lawyers into the system . " " But , Sid , " I say , trying to smooth the anger out of my voice , " from my first minute in this country I have heard nothing but the crimes of the Gang of Four , the thousands jailed without charges , without appeal , unjustly . . . " " Yes , but that was not the system , it was the breakdown of the system ! The Gang of Four disrupted the system ! " I am surprised that this particular kind of childishness can still start anger flowing into me . But there are millions like him all over the world who have managed to convince themselves that revolution can not and should not make men freer . Every eighteenth- and nineteenth-century revolution at least declared the rights of the person to be the centerpiece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state could not reach into the individual 's life . Now only the state has rights and powers , and the person , like his property , belongs to the collective , with no recourse or appeal if fools or factions should decide on his ruin . With our disagreement in the open , Sid Shapiro does not look contented any longer , but that is life and can not be helped . What occurs to me , however , is that this moment is emitting the same opaque quality as Students in Shanghai 's Tsao Yang II Middle School perform eye exercises frequently arises with Chinese when any principle is up for discussion . Shapiro must surely be disturbed , if only remotely , by a society in effect without law , but a revolutionary can not display his own uncertainties , let alone allow them to be part of a discussion . So it is once again not so much a cultural barrier I feel warding me off in China ? Shapiro and I could not be more alike culturally as a political creed whose fundamentals must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those not of the faith . As we drive away down the quiet Peking back streets , mazelike and narrow , the thought returns that hardly more than 10 percent of Chinese live in cities , and that " out there " is the vast majority , bent to the earth as it has been forever . Is Marxism , with its nearly religious expectation of the human community reborn , the true successor system of capitalism or feudalism ? The distance to post-Renaissance parliamentary capitalism is truly vast , but to feudalism it is amazingly close . Feudal man " owed " much to the group ; everything , in fact . Under the Chinese kind of socialism he can not move his residence without higher permission , for he is " part " of his commune , his factory , his social organization , and every single one of the nearly billion Chinese , like the Russians , is a member of what in feudal times was called a guild and here is called a collective ? of doctors , dentists , workers , peasants . Looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the very concept of an individual standing  | apart from the group is no longer possible for the mind to entertain . And it has happened , too , I recall , in another place and another time . The Puritans also forbade lawyers ; I even gave to Judge Danforth in The Crucible a response to the very mystery I am now turning around in my head . " The pure in heart need no lawyers , " he assures the complainants who come to beg him for lawyers to defend their loved ones against the charge of witchcraft . And there , as here , it was not mere cynicism that drove intelligent men to embrace and celebrate their own vulnerability before injustice . It was the age-old dream of unity , of sonship and daughterhood , of the trustingness of family transposed into social relations . And all of it by virtue of a high belief in the state 's sublimity , in the Society of Saints in Massachusetts and in socialism here in China . One may smile at its naivetes , but not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the feats in war and construction it rallies them to perform . The Puritan theocracy lost its monopoly when surpluses of food and goods undermined the earlier need for a near-military unity and the justification for the suppression of conflicting ideas . Has the time approached for China when suppression , for analogous reasons , no longer appears as justified as it did when the Japanese Army still occupied the country , and a feudal Chiang Kai-shek had yet to be pushed into the sea ? A Sid Shapiro , in a word , persists in his warm bondage to the sublime , the very same condition from which the Chinese are cautiously emerging , for the first time daring to judge their leaders on a human scale . 4 . Too Mang People Down on the Farm It is hard to believe we 've been in China less than a week . The outside world , the " real " one , has been closing down for me , but I am brought back to it near midnight when Bill Hinton shows up . He is a big blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his thick neck and broad limbs , a look of deep tiredness . Hinton is the American author of five books on China , among them Fanshen , which I foolishly had avoided reading for years , on the mistaken assumption that anyone who had put so many years into China must be unreliably partisan . A few days before we left for China , the book became a daily point of reference for me and for Inge as well . Hinton had found himself in the forties right in the middle of typical peasant life in the Liberated Area , and personally took part in the struggles within the peasantry to drive out feudalism @# and establish socialism on the land . Surprisingly , the book , like a novel , is filled with personalities , individuals groping for a lifeline out of the darkness of the feudalism the Reds had smashed . Among other things it is the detailed story of life at the bottom , sometimes the day-by-day record of the attempt to make everyone in the village equal , right down to the number of pots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the landholdings . Its candor has inevitably drawn the condemnation of many radicals , but it is read b Chinese because their own writers have yet to produce a work so truthfully recording conflicts inside the Revolution . Hinton , who operates a one-man farm of 400 acres in Pennsylvania , went to the Far East from Cornell . He has spent a total of ten years in China , he figures , and has been coming back and forth for the past thirty . He seems a worried , mystified , but not hopeless man now . Indeed , China is the apple of his eye , and if he criticizes , it is to save her from herself . " I 've got to get home next week to bring in my corn . I wasted a couple of weeks with pneumonia out there in Kiangsi . Probably would have got better sooner , but all these folks I used to work with in the forties kept coming in to give me advice how to get better and bringing candy and all kinds of stuff I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He laughs with love and pride , but the look of preoccupation never clears from his eyes . " We 've been hearing all about the Cultural Revolution . . . " " Oh , Christ , yes . " He keeps nodding for half a minute , trying to decide how to say what he wants to say , then sighs . " I do n't know how to tell you . . . " @# @#  | " It has all the earmarks of a mass hypnosis . " " That could be . " He ventures forth now . " I know r a fact that people were literally crucified against ails in some places , nails driven through their palms , rid left to die . . . " It is hard for him to continue , obviously , and I change the subject . " What are you up to here this me ? " " I 'm the consultant on the land reclamation project Kiangsi . " " Is it working out ? " " It will , I think . They 're pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make light of it , and laugh . " You sound a little doubtful . " " No , not about reclamation . It 's the mechanization ) f the land that 's the problem . They just took delivery ) n a million bucks ' worth of John Deere tractors . The John Deere engineers did n't think they needed those giant machines at fifty grand apiece , but they 've been ip there and saw for themselves now ? some fields are 2000 acres ? so they shipped the machines . " " You mean they wo n't know how to operate them ? " " Oh , no , they 're quick learners , they 'll do that okay . But the way to get food out of spaces like that is to let the machine do what it was designed to do , and they 're already starting an influx of people into the area . " " What 's wrong with that ? " " They 'll defeat the benefits they could get from the mechanization . You do n't want tens of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got : he machines to exploit it . They 'll slow it down , they 'll gyring it to a goddamn halt . I produce , all by myself , plus machines , more corn on second-rate Pennsylvania sidehills than a Chinese brigade of anywhere from forty to sixty people . They 're creeping up to a billion population , they ca n't afford this nonsense . They 're going to bring down that beautiful producing area by letting that mob loose onto it , and they 'll be back where they started . " " I guess they do n't know what to do with all those people . " " Well , Christ , I do n't either , but you do n't want them stamping around and bringing down the food supply , or they 're all done . " He snorts , shakes his head , rubs his palms into his hair . " I do n't know . I just do n't know . It 's so damned hard to change a people 's tradition ? the minute they see usable land they flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always was . " I am trying my best to suppress my interest in the crucifixions he mentioned . Meanwhile . . . " I see they 've got a lot of these walking tractors . . . " Oh , yes , they 're turning them out by the thousands now . " " I have one myself in Connecticut . " They 're really not much good for field work , but they use them a lot for transport and pumping ? a portable power supply ? and I guess they 're useful that way . But they do n't really do much to mechanize agriculture . " " I notice them all over the roads . " " Sure . Even their fifty- and sixty-horse big tractors are mostly hauling people on the roads ' cause that 's how they can make the quickest buck . " " I 'd have thought there 'd be a more rational use of machines than that . More control from above . . . He smiles . " I would n't be too sure the control from above is always all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had me looking over some of their new tractors , basically the clumsy old Russian design . And I noticed they did n't have any drawbars . . . " ( The drawbar is a heavy bar of flat steel bolted to the tractor 's rear end for the purpose of pulling a plow , mower , or other implement . All the pulling forces of the tractor converge on the drawbar , and a tractor without one is like a rake without teeth . ) " How do they pull things , then ? " " From the three-point hitch , " Hinton says . " But that 's for lifting , not pulling ; do n't they break it ? " " Sure do . So the head of the tractor factory heard me out and called in his engineers and said , Why do n't we have a drawbar on our tractor ? ' Well , " Hinton goes on , " first he called in his assistants , and the assistants called in their assistants , and in ten minutes nobody understood what anybody else was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no need for a drawbar and it could n't be used with a drawbar . " So I went out in the shop with them and got them under the tractor where actually there were four drilled and tapped holes under the rear-end housing to attach the drawbar bracket to . I mean they were drilling and tapping those holes and nobody had ever wondered what they were supposed to be there for . " " That is sad . " " Yes , it is . " " So what are we really talking about ? " I ask . " Well , for one thing , they separate designer from the practice , because that 's what this is all about , and right up and down the society . It 's part of their feudal burden which is so damned difficult to throw off . " I was in a tractor plant around Tientsin not long ago , and I got on one of their machines to find out why the hell it had such a wide turning circle . A decent tractor should turn on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's important in maneuvering in the field . " Well , I braked this tractor and all its innards protested and I thought it was going to bust all its bearings . I tried another one and it was the same  | thing ? sounded like it was rupturing . The chief of the plant was watching with all his engineers and they were highly amused . I was n't . I noticed they had an old Massey-Ferguson there , probably the only one of its kind in China , which God knows how they got hold of . And I mounted it and swiveled it around right and left like a kiddy car . And the chief was impressed . " He now asked why their machines could n't turn like that and the engineers looked a little sheepish . Then he asked his head engineer , Have you ever driven a tractor ? ' And he had n't . Then he asked the second engineer if he 'd ever driven one . Well , of course , none of them had so much as mounted a tractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is real life . " " But would n't they have even been curious enough to ? " " No , no , the point is that driving the machine was a manual thing and they are not and do not want to be manual workers . The fact that I 've got a university degree and worked for eight years as a truck mechanic , and that I farm ? these are incomprehensible contradictions to them . And it 's that in feudal China no brain worker ever so much as touched an object with his hands . It declassed him . In this case , the plant chief ordered every one of them to learn to drive a tractor within a month and it was a revolutionary idea . " " Discouraging . " " It is , but that does n't mean they 're not going to make it . They will . They 're going to make it , but it 's going to be a long time . " We sit in silence for a moment . Suddenly he says , " I 'm an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion he has come to after a long time . " You speak Chinese , I guess , do n't you ? " I ask . " Sure , in a way . Not great but pretty well . " " Do you find a kind of veil between them and you ? " He thinks for a moment . " Not with peasants . I get straight answers from peasants . " " They 're not afraid to talk about the system 's fail-ings ? " " Sometimes . But mostly they come right out with it . You see , there 's no way of punishing peasants because they already are where you 're sent for punishment . " He smiles . " The land is punishment . " " Sure , for intellectuals and city people . But the peasant knows he ca n't get any further down so he 's not afraid to talk straight . But it 's different in Peking , for instance , with any official people . The indirection is enough to make me dizzy . I ca n't get close to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , nobody wants to be the one to make a decision he can be blamed for later . " " Were your people farmers ? " " No . At least not for generations . They were New England professionals and Midwesterners . " " I keep asking the same question and getting no answer . It seems to me after this recent disaster some-body ought to be thinking about law . About some independent point of appeal from injustice , even if : : ? within the Party . . . " " Oh , they had that . Injustice was not supposed happen because the Party was watching . . . " I guess they ca n't discuss it because an independent judiciary implies that the Party is separate from the people . " " That 's probably right , yes . " " You think it 's important ? " " I sure as hell do . " " Do you understand what happened here in the past ten years ? " " I do not . And I doubt anybody else does . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . does n't it ? " He stares ahead for a moment , then looks at me Something profoundly hurtful is in his face . " It often happened , you know , that they 'd suddenly come out of the hills " Who ? " " People . Thousands of them around a leader . A leader nobody 'd heard of before . A new warlord. young , sassy , who did n't give a shit for anything or anybody ? right out of some commune somewhere . and behind him his own staff , runners , arms , even concubines . Right out of the tenth century , including the contempt for the peasant , the kick in the teeth . . . " The hurt in his eyes is simmering . " The worst of it was to see how quick they were to tear at each other , to humiliate anyone handy . That was the worst of it . seeing that again , that awful desire to grind somebody into the earth . . . " A pause . Some air of helplessness before evidence he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They had a real civil war going . Heavy artillery battles . Thousands of people were killed . . . " " What I still find hard to grasp is , what did Mao make of that chaos ? I mean he was still there , right ? , too , bul And still functioning . . . ? " Hinton shakes his head , grins at me . " He said both sides were wrong . " " But made no move to stop the fighting . " " Oh , no ? he said , Argue , but do n't fight . ' " " But they were fighting . With artillery , even . " " Yes , that 's right . But it had gotten completely out of control . " " So what 'd he do ? " Hinton looks down at his hands , then back to me , shaking his head . " Nobody understands this , Miller . Not yet . Maybe it 's too soon . "  | " I wonder sometimes if he was n't actually playing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule for as long as they could , until they in turn were overwhelmed by some new concept , until finally , after a lot of blood and God knows what chaos ? there would be a democracy . " Hinton nods for a moment , shrugs . " I do n't know . Nobody knows . " " You do n't agree with my idea . " " I probably do n't , no . " He stretches out his legs and rests both hands on top of his head . " I did a study , The Hundred Day War , about the Cultural Revolution in one university , Tsingtao . " " I have n't read it yet . . . " " You might look at it . What I found was that after the first weeks of struggle , all question of political principle really collapsed . What you finally had was simply a power fight between leaders . There was no moral or political content anymore , simply the egos . This is what our American radicals simply ca n't digest , or the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm attacked so much . But I was there , and I saw it , and that 's how it was . " " You do n't have to sell me . But let me go further : Do you think this kind of protracted turmoil was a kind of substitute for a system which does n't exist here , a system to transfer power to new people within an institutional framework ? In other words , is it that the feudal class system reasserts itself time and again because , in effect , there is no legal sanction to slow it down ? " " I 'd have to think about that . It 's possible . " " And that 's why you keep getting these wild swings ? from hard authoritarianism over to anarchy and back again . It 's all a groping for , so to speak , the watercourses down which the power can flow back and forth , instead of breaking loose and flooding the landscape . But I have to add that what is so unique is that these swings are still possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phenomenon within any normal ideological framework . " There is a pause and he nods . " I 'm inclined that way too , but I tell you , the thing is so complex , so subtle , that maybe there 's just no way to grasp it . But there 's something else that makes it so hard to get a handle on , " he says , and takes a breath . " China is a cultural desert . I mean there is no way of denying that . They have n't got the novels , plays , poems , and the rest that might reflect what happened , you see ? All they 've got is political analysis and political declaration . But there has not been a cultural response , beyond a single play like Loyal Hearts , which , I understand , deals with the impact of the Four on doctors . But a decade like this one past ought to have exploded , it seems to me , in all kinds of art . Yet there 's next to nothing , and so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call it , by which to find our way to an understanding . " " You think they 've got political prisoners ? " " I suppose . But not like they used to . I do n't really know for sure , but I would guess they did . I should tell you that another reason why it 's all so hard to penetrate is that the press never publishes what they call negative news . " Maybe that is why so many of the people we are meeting seem to go out of their way to be candid about negative aspects . " Possibly , " Hinton says , but rather cautiously . " What do you make of Chiang Ching ? " I ask . " That 's easy . She was only the most spectacular of the mediocrities , the kind of people you find everywhere who have never accomplished anything , but have these ideas ' instead . " " The bullshit triumphant . " " The con artists . They yell about bureaucracy until they get their hands on the bureaucratic machines themselves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about this novel that 's going around in typescript . " " You mean like a samizdat ? " " I 'm not sure . " He corrects himself . " I mean I 'm not sure whether it will continue to be suppressed . " And corrects himself again . " Or even whether it 's just being left to dangle from some bureaucrat 's fingers for the moment . Anyway , there 's no author 's name on it , and it 's typewritten , and it opens like this . " A woman is rushing across a bridge one winter 's afternoon . Clutched to her breast is a sick , dying infant , and she is dragging a reluctant six-year-old by the hand . She stops passersby to ask for the nearest hospital or doctor , people direct her , she is half-hysterical as she rushes along . Suddenly , in the middle of the bridge , the six-year-old catches hold of the railing and hangs on , wo n't go a step further . She pulls at him , screams at him , slaps him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves him and she rushes off with her gasping infant . " A few minutes later an armed guard approaches . Mao is supposed to pass over this bridge at any minute and they are sweeping the area to protect him . The guard sees the six-year-old and tries to move him along , talks to him but gets no answer . He bends over , deciding to break the child 's grip on the railing , and discovers the hand is made of steel . He reaches under the sleeve and finds a steel arm . It is a robot bomb . They disarm it just as Mao 's car approaches the bridge . " " What an opening ! And then what happens ? " " I do n't know , that 's all I read " " Just so I 'm clear , which faction is supposed to be behind the bomb ? "  | He thinks for a moment . " I really do n't know . " I feel a rush of frustration . " Well , would it be the Gang of Four ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he gets rid of her ? " " Possible . But maybe it 's the anti-Maoists trying to get rid of Mao and her . " " This is a complicated country . " " This is China . " He stands , his denim work jacket rolled up in one hand . " I 've got to get ready to leave , start getting my corn in . " We shake hands . He waves to Inge , who has been trying to keep awake on the bed after sixteen hours on her feet today , taking pictures . " It 's terrific you speak the language , Inge . It 'll help a lot . They 'll be flattered you took the trouble . Good luck . " At the door he turns and laughs . " 1 say a lot of negative things , but I do n't want you to get the idea that . . . " " I understand . " " The Revolution is loved by them . Do n't ever forget that . It 's their pride and their dignity and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the old system , which was organized stupidity and perpetual disaster . But there 's going to have to be a lot of bad habits changed and a lot of hard truths faced before they can move on ahead . With nearly a billion out there , they do n't have a minute to waste , you see ? " " Not ten seconds , sounds like . " " Not even five , " he laughs , and moves out into the dimly lit hallway , and walks away in his long-striding lope . He has invested the better part of all his hopes in China , and now he is tired , and there is no end in sight . 5 . The Sian - Shanghai Choo-Choo he chief conductor of the Sian-Shanghai Express carries his immense importance with professional ease .

He is not your average ticket puncher who may or may not be able to turn up the air-conditioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train . He is not shy . He bows slightly as he slides the compartment door open and enters with a dignified but warm smile on his round face , his blue uniform of light cotton spotless and well ironed . He is making the rounds of the few compartments with foreign passengers in them , asking if we have any suggestions for improving the service . " It is difficult to sleep in this compartment , " I say , " because there is very little air , and if one opens the window , soot comes in , or a big draft . " @# @# He seems surprised and not too happy to hear t ? and points upward at two circular air vents . " Those all open . " " Maybe they are , but nothing 's coming through them . " He sits there on one of the couches and his expression seems rather defensive , and I am fairly sure he itt not accepting my criticism . Outside , the rice paddies are gorgeously green , not that we are far from the Yenan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , up and about w- i : t first light , are chopping and hauling , spreading nigr soil among the plants , or riding on little trailers behind the two-wheeled walking tractors . I have yet to see a tractor actually working land , but it is usual to see a dozen or more peasants , men and women side by side in a line , slowly chopping their way across the landscape as they hoe a field . The chief conductor has spotted Inge 's brokenbacked Chinese grammar book and he takes it from where it lies beside her , asking what she is doing with it . She answers in Chinese , and a great grin breaks out on his face and he is full of questions about her interest in the language . " I will fix your book for you , " he saes. folding his hands around the dog-eared volume . And now he turns to me and says , " I regret about the air . but the vents are really all open . " " I 'm sorry too , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look into the problem . " Now we settle in for our talk . " How old is this train ? " " It was built in 1956 . " " It 's new , then , practically , by American standards . " " Fairly new . " " Russian design ? " " Yes , that was all we had then . We must design new ones , especially with air-conditioning . " " You like air-conditioning ? " " Oh , yes , air-conditioning is very , very good . It is the most important improvement you can possibly have on a train . " " I agree . " " Have they given you enough hot water and tea ? " He picks up the thermos and weighs it in his hand . " Quite enough , thank you . How is it to be chief conductor ? What are your worst problems ? " " Well , of course , the equipment is quite old now . We must have new equipment . But we are building five new railroads and we must wait until those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well last night ?

" " I suppose they 're busy doing something important . - two hotels now they were moving steel beams mind in the courtyard all night . " " Yes , but we are building all the time , you see . " " I have no doubt about that . What other problems es a chief conductor have ? Are there ever thieves on sins ? " " Oh , yes , " he smiles contentedly . " There are many . " " Really ! What do they look to steal ? " " Whatever they can lay hands on . " " Even under socialism ? " Some people still have the habit . " He makes a abbing motion with one hand . " But we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board ? " " At all times . They deal with these people very well . They rarely succeed in stealing anything . " " And besides stealing ? Are there ever collisions ? " " Not since the Gang of Four was overthrown . " " How did they cause wrecks ? " " By organizing struggle against discipline . " " Could you be more specific ? How did they organize struggle against discipline ? " " Many ways . One way was to start a discussion among the workers just as a train was about to leave the station . They 'd delay one train , then another , until . t pile-up was inevitable in all the confusion . The servicng of the equipment broke down for the same kind of reasons . " " But I should think it would be to their interest that trains not crash . And who could conceivably gain from such confusion ? " He looks at me to be sure I really am so naive . " But you have heard of their slogan . " " Which one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a capitalist train that comes in on time . ' " He laughs at the ludicrous idea and I ask , " And nowadays is there any ideological work going on on this train , or are you purely interested in efficiency ? " " There certainly is ideological work . We are always educating ourselves as Marxists . There are Party members in our crew . " " How many ? " He counts in his head for a moment . " Nine out of forty-three crew members . I am the head of our Party branch . . . " He suddenly breaks off , noticing a volume of T'ang poetry in Inge 's carrying net . Asking her permission , he takes out the book and totally loses consciousness of me . " Where did you get this ? " he asks in surprise . " In the Sian bookstore . " " I did not know it was in print again . " And he seems to lose himself in the poems from that most glorious era more than a thousand years ago . With excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store this was found in . Su informs him and regrets that he did not accept a set of two volumes which Inge offered to buy for him ? for a dollar or so . The T'ang poems , some of the most admired in the language , were prohibited by the Gang of Four in another attempt to wipe out memory of the Chinese past with the excuse that it was feudal and slavish and glorified only the rulers and their running dogs . But as both Su , a reader of classics , and the conductor doubtless are aware , this was by no means the first regime in their history that attempted to wipe out the past by burning the books of former dynasties in the hope of obliterating their influence . For ten minutes or so Inge , Su Kuang , and I sit silently as the chief conductor , his face enraptured , turns from poem to poem . Then , as though refreshed , he stands up with a happy sigh , thanks Inge for letting him see her book , and backs out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth Is Never a Straight Line " Je were of course paying our own expenses , but we were nevertheless the " guests " of the Friendship Association . That meant we must be met by a small delegation in each stopping place and on our first night given a " banquet , " at which one or two members of the Association were our hosts . The " banquet , " we were thankful to discover , required only two , possibly three , toasts with the thimblefuls of 109  | Mao Tai , a potent , vodkalike drink of 60 percent alcohol , and/or a sherrylike sweetish wine . Actually the " banquet " was always a delicious but not immoderate meal spread over many courses , and prepared as it was for our small number of people ( sequestered in some private room or a corner of the hotel dining room shielded by screens ) , the food was hot and not lukewarm , as it often had to be when served to large numbers of guests . In Kweilin our banquet was presided over by a vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in his mid-forties , a political professional who evidently was the Party 's man to deal with foreign writers and artists . Elsewhere the job was more often held by a writer or artist . In Canton it was a novelist banned for eleven years who was still incapable of starting a new work . In Hangchow it was a writer who had staged shows for the troops at Yenan during the Long March period of the thirties and had known Mao and Chou ; he was writing a long novel about the famed Fourth Route Army , of which he had been a young soldier . It should be remembered that the early fall of 1978 marked the moment immediately before the pustule of Mao-worship burst open , but there could be no certainty of that , and for such as he it would not be easy , especially when speaking to a stranger and a foreigner , to mar the grandeur of Mao Tse-tung by the least criticism . " Yes , I used to see him almost every day in Yenan . He lived as we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " And he grinned warmly , lovingly . The Yenan Museum of the Revolution came back to mind then : a cold and rather desolate building in Soviet mausoleum style , its main exhibit a photo-montage running along the walls which showed snapshots of the arrival and life of the Eighth and Fourth Route armies , and a collection of their weapons and utensils . Ahead of us as we slowly moved along studying the photos were two peasants dressed in clothes so patched as to seem like overdone costumes for a naturalistic play . One of them carried a burlap sack on his back and even the sack was patched ; and he kept clearing his sinuses and whanging great gobs of spit over the floor , despite the ubiquitous spittoons . Disgusting as it was , one could not help wondering at these peasants ' quite evident air of proprietorship ? it was their museum . In any case , it was the likes of the spitter and his friend that had made up the armies of the Revolution , and it was their faith and resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , the 90 percent of the people who lived on the land , that any demythologizing of Mao would have ultimately to contend with . For in the few peasant dwellings that we managed to see there was always a sort of Mao corner , where some photo of him , often a color shot from an old newspaper . was tacked to the wall like an icon . If China has no religion , and it has none , Mao nevertheless is as good as any godlike presence and force , and our host 's tone in referring to him was appropriate to the departed ones place in cosmology . But notwithstanding all this , plus the fact that our host was himself a Party member and an official of the Revolutionary Council , he was easily the most forth-coming and candid of anyone we had so far met when I raised the question of whether any thought was being given to preventing the recurrence of what was admit-ted to be fascism in China . But even he tensed , and giggled ( a vocalization which implicitly confirms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actuality making light of its importance . The Chinese giggle an absolutely invaluable means of healing a breach before it is even visible in social intercourse , while at the same time acknowledging that a breach has in fact occurred ) . His tension made it clear that my question was not academic . He began answering with light , generalizing strokes . " It is a question we must consider , yes . But ever since the overthrow of the Gang , people are far more vigi-lant , and they will not permit such excesses to happen " But how will they not permit it ' ? The government controls the press , right ? " " Of course . "  | I decided , in view of his apparent willingness to cuss the matter , to go all out with him . " And the Party never looks lightly at opposition once it adopts a line , right ? " It was not quite so easy for him to agree to this , but had courage and he finally nodded , " That is true , Y. " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it time to think : , out setting up some institution whose job it would be Iu hold independent powers of appeal , for example ? I Mean newspapers , or maybe even some new agency within the Party with the right to dissent . I think you ople are the prisoners of your own decisions and you n't leave yourselves a graceful way out when they n't work . It 's a contradiction you discuss things , u decide , you then demand unity around the decion . And that makes it impossible to put on the brakes the decision is dumb . " There was a pause . Surprisingly , unlike Chinese and Americans before him on our voyage , this man apparttly quite agreed with my thought . But he seemed to be debating whether to admit it . Finally he looked at - ne straight and said , " The people are now deliberating out this . " " But do you personally believe anything will come ) t it ? I mean , can the Party ever divide its authori- He thought again , unhappily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling that he had had discussions afore this but that the nerve may not have been touched , and now he was forcing himself to touch it . " In the early days of the Revolution , " he said , not quite meeting my gaze , " there was a fine tradition of democracy here . The people ? all of them would vote about everything . They were almost all illiterate , but : here were bowls set out , and they would drop in black ) r white beans to vote yes or no on rival issues and candidates . And there is something else . " Su Kuang , who was translating , showed a certain excitement in his eyes which was hard to interpret . It was either surprise at this official 's being so candid or else his own fear of the discussion spilling over its roper limits . " To be a cadre now has become a profession . It used to be a vocation , work that one did because one felt called to it and to the sacrifice it entailed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last , not the first to get wing space but the last , and he drank from the bottom , f the cup , not the top . To be a cadre was not an honor then , it was a walk into the direct line of fire . More than likely , in fact , the people you were trying to help could not understand , at least not all of them , and ? uld distrust you and even hate you . To be a cadre , .. see , was not a profession in those times . " We ate . No one spoke . A marvelous sweet-and-sour fish arrived , steaming . Whatever one 's feelings about socialism , no one who cared about human beings could exult at the recurrence of the taming of the heart , the splaying out of revolutionary idealism , and this man 's puzzlement . But he was far from giving way to despair . I said , " No country can rely on revolutionary passions forever . Justice has got to be institutionalized and put beyond the reach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you will lock yourselves into your errors . And I want you to understand that in my country that is exactly what we have done from time to time , but one can finally be heard after a lot of waste and a lot of agony . " His comment was typical for the Chinese . Or was it only the Maoist in him ? He grinned . " But the waste is part of the moving forward . Truth is never a straight line . " In short , China had aeons behind her , and plenty of time ahead in which to find her proper way . We ate the fish . I felt we had narrowed any distance between us . " How 'd you get your job ? You 're not elected , are you ? " " By the Central Committee of the Party , yes . " After four Mao Tais one gets to say anything . " Do the people ever get to vote ? I mean people outside the Party ? " Our host had not drunk much at all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they vote . " " When did they vote last ? " He had to think a while . " About five years ago . " " And when will they vote again ? " He grinned . " I must tell you what I admire most about Americans . You always get to say what is on your minds . " We all laughed . And then he said , " I would recommend to you a speech by Mao which he delivered in 1962 . . . " It was the speech , widely republished only in the past year or so , in which Mao had warned that if they did not succeed in generating back talk from a feudal people they would end in a kind of fascism . 7 . Of Artists and Writers When one is passing before the paintings on exhibition at the Nanking artists ' center , it is not difficult to imagine what the artist 's problem is in China at present . Pictures of happy workers and peasants in heavy black outline , their costumes and flesh tones bright and optimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark , emphasizing a stylized verticality ? the elemental falling water , the mountain , and the forest . And , indeed , the three middle-aged painters escorting us agree that there is a tremendous gap between 111  | the mute abstractionism of the traditional art and the posterlike advertising cartoons ? no doubt favored by the Party that are sandwiched in between . " We need a synthesis between them , and we hope a great master will arise who will combine representation and the abstract . " But at least this can be said aloud , now that the government has changed . Like the writers , they know little of Western painting , and complain that when the French sent an exhibition a short while before , it was all landscapes , whereas the Chinese already know everything there is to know about landscape painting . I ask if they are familiar with Van Gogh , thinking that his peasant and village subjects might appeal to them , and indeed they have seen reproductions of his work , but never an original that might demonstrate his laying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be relevant to their hope of creating a non-naturalistic but representational style . The very concept of a personalized art sits uneasily with them , but the pressing guidance of the state was heavy on the painter 's hand centuries before the Communists came to power . Indeed , it may be said that most of the world for most of the time has been governed by autocracy of one kind or another , and art is inevitably subjected to it . Michelangelo can hardly be said to have had carte blanche from the Pope for his ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , which , needless to say , is painted over with symbols that reinforce the authority of the Christian Church and not the Moslem , Jewish , or Buddhist , and surely not agnosticism or atheism . Art and privacy of inspiration have no very long history together . But the Chinese seem to have a veritable lust for symbolization ? probably owing to the nature of the language ? and , more to the point , a fine zeal for symbolic political interpretations of art . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogue was compiled of paintings to be sold . it was hoped , to foreign buyers in order to raise money to support the Vietnamese resistance to the Americans . Chen Ta Yu had a painting of a cock in this collection which was carefully examined by the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai , whose approval was required for the catalogue to be printed . Explains one of the painters to us now : " They came to the conclusion that the tail of the cock , which pointed to the sky , was too erect , and too high . The cock in China is a fighting bird , and this one 's eyes were so emphatically large and its claws so powerful , the figure certainly symbolized the arrogance of aggressive fascism attacking socialism and was basically a rightist picture and was prohibited . " The three painters laugh , as do Inge and I and Su Kuang , but one has to wonder how they maneuvered in the other time . Were they ever seduced by this hieroglyphic politics in art ? Did it seem so absurd at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy power ? Power , after all , makes any absurdity ever so slightly logical . In fact , as they explain , Chou En-lai had personally selected some of the paintings whi the Gang promptly labeled " black , " or " returns to t sinister line , " and since no one was permitted to know anything about the painters themselves , " a great many innocent folk were convinced of the existence of a nest of counter-revolutionary painters in Nanking . And none of us was allowed to reply , although there was a tremendous and long-lasting campaign against us in the press . " Now , without any discussion , we are informed that the three painters will paint a picture in our honor . A long white sheet of rice paper is produced , and each painter sets out his clump of brushes as well as an elaborate old ink stone . This stone , set in a hardwood box , itself often beautifully carved , absorbs ink very slowly and in a cavity holds enough of its seepage so that a brush can be dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and old ones in the antique stores bring very high prices . ) The painting is started by one artist who begins the bottom , pushing his inked brush against the g of the soft bristles , making a clump of long , half-i thick lines running vertically up about a third of paper . Then , with a sharper brush , he slashes in w are obviously pine branches , and we have a dense thicket .  | Number two man takes over and with much lighter rokes traces a long curve which turns out to be a aterfall beginning a little above the midway point of e picture and descending almost to the bottom , the nes splattering off in all directions . Number three artist adds the mountain which is Docked into the upper right side . Now number two turns and adds a wash of faint pinkish-gray to the fling water , and a deeper pink to the pine thicket . umber one moves in again to make the thicket a bit - ore dense , and number three counters with another , -. of at the waterfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggle as they add their separate changes , for they have never tried this before . In about twenty minutes we have a good landscape which , if it seems to lack somehat in feeling , is rather elegantly proportioned and deftly drawn . The most beautiful part of it , however , is the dedicatory column of Chinese characters drawn along one edge and ending in the personal name-seal of : ne of the artists ? the others have forgotten to bring : heir seals along . The effort , of course , is in part political and prearranged , yet the feeling of the artists is certainly genuine ; their curiosity about Western art is too avid : o be faked , and this gift , they hope , may help open the oor to the world a bit more . As we leave the gallery , I can not help wondering why public buildings here , as in Russia , have to be so gloomy , so unloved in conception as well as in upkeep . We certainly have plenty of ugly public buildings , but : hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination , some awkward or naive fantasy , or even some truly horrible splurges of bad taste . But in so many post-Liberation public buildings in China there is a sort of silence of the eye , as though , once the walls were tight against the elements , their designers simply fled the sight of them . 8 . Of Actors and Playwrights if , as has been said , " you ca n't go farther than China , " it is still possible in the theater for one 's sense of human nature 's universality to be restored . The Chinese in the theater laugh when we would , do n't : augh when we would not . The cultural information is quite different East and West , but what the heart makes of it is quite similar . Loyal Hearts is the most celebrated post-Gang of Four play , and the first to reveal some of the details of that period . Its author , Su Shu-yang , is in his early thirties and still works in the Traditional Medical Institute as a high-level specialist . Sitting beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , as any new playwright should be . His models , he says , are Chekhov and the Ibsen of the social plays . Clearly , Loyal Hearts was fashioned as a weapon and its force as a social document seems undeniable ; the audience is profoundly moved at the end . To say that it is also of a realism which is by now pedestrian in the West is not to deny its validity as a play , for its mode fits its subject and the author 's intention . The plot concerns old Doctor Fang , who heads up a research group that has made important discoveries leading to the creation of the 03 tablet , a medicine useful in the treatment of heart disease . The government ( the Gang , of course ) is attacking Doctor Fang for catering to the big shots of the city , who , they allege , are the main sufferers from the disease . Should such a charge be allowed to stick , Doctor Fang will be labeled a bourgeois counter-revolutionary and will doubtless suffer professionally as well . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But more is involved for the good doctor . A proud , redoubtable old fellow , he regards himself as a patriot faithful to the Revolution , for whom such charges are an abomination . As Su Kuang 's rapid-fire translation poured into my ear , I could not help being discouraged by the sheer childishness of the procedure ? imagine diseases being identified as bourgeois ! On second thought , though , I recalled that a disease such as black lung belongs to coal miners , and a University of Michigan study some years ago said that middle-class psychosomatic illnesses collect in the stomach area and the head , while workers worry more about injuries to their limbs . Anyway , in Loyal Hearts the accusation has little to do with science , having been generated , it now develops , because Premier Chou had taken a personal interest in the research , publicly complimenting old Doctor Fang on his group 's discovery of 03 . ( Chou 's gesture surprises the audience as much as it would in real life. )  | Under the conditions of the Gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence of death . To make matters worse , Chou ( in the play ) had talked for a full hour with the members of the research group , taking time out at the recent Fourth National People 's Congress to emphasize his belief that heart disease affects all the people and not just bureaucrats , and that its cure and treatment are needs of national scope . Thus the gauntlet is thrown down between the Chou ? Doctor Fang side and the Gang , which , one ought to remember , was nothing less at the time than the government of China , including the aged Mao . This background political conflict is articulated through members of the old doctor 's family and his associates . The tone is that of An Enemy of the People , the impulsion being pre-eminently social and moral ; there is little or no subjective life expressed , and the people have characteristics rather than character . While the dialogue manages to box the compass to ring in the main current slogans ? " Learning from facts , " " Do n't forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so forth ? it is also undeniable that below the cliches runs an emotion at least as genuine as the feeling that may underlie any other credo or religious conviction expressed in formulas . The current ideological bases may be touched along the way , but there is a loving hand behind it all , rather than a mere teaching or disciplinary harshness , and it seems to be the love that touches the audience . It is this , too , which makes a rather lumbering historical coincidence at the end seem within the range of emotional reason . Doctor Fang perseveres ; the perverse or cowardly characters fail ; truth ? and China ? win out ; and the grateful old doctor suggests that his colleagues join him in a letter of thanks to the extremely ill Premier Chou . As pen touches paper they hear funeral music ? in a howling wind that has begun to blow outside ? and Premier Chou , it turns out , a : that very moment has died . The characters weep wit grief , and as the funeral music moans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " OLbeloved premier . You were the good premier of the people . Your loyal heart beat only for the people . . As " The International " displaces the funeral music . and the curtain descends , the audience is overcome . What is interesting is not the identity of one side another in this political fight , but the values upheld the play and its audience . For if Chou is depicted as determined and fearless , he is also humane , truthful undogmatic , and warm . So it would seem that nearly half a century of terrible struggle in revolution . famine , and war has not hardened the Chinese against the more liberal civilized ideals ? or so this highly successful play and its audience would indicate . But it should be added that a physics professor we met on a long train ride felt that the play , which he had watched on its nationwide telecast , was way over the average man 's head and much too sophisticated . " I do n't think the peasants had the slightest notion what that play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had thought , the play was clear enough for anyone to understand . Then was the gap between country and city , lower and upper grades of education , indeed so incredibly wide ? I was not prepared for a test of my belief that human emotions , at least as expressed on stage , are quite universal . After the performance of Kuo Mo-jo 's Tsa : Wen Ji , the sixty-eight-year-old director of the Peking People 's Art Theatre insisted that I sit down with the cast for a serious discussion of the play . Since the story is medieval and the acting stylized , as befits the traditional play , I did not feel precisely on home ground with it , and after exchanging greetings with the large cast , I expatiated on the production , the magnificent sets and costumes , and the strong and , to me , exotic acting . Tsao Yu , the black-haired director , a restless bantam of a sexagenarian who can not sit still or suppress a wisecrack , commanded silence of his actors so that I could hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , however exotic , had bored me with its relentless repetitiousness . And from what I could detect in the audience 's feeling , repetition is repetition in Chinese also . " Quite candidly , " I said , " I assume it is my unfamiliarity with your history , but I have to tell you that the play itself I found rather boring . " A startled look instantly flew across the faces of the cast . They were still , of course , in their gorgeous , flowing medieval costumes , and their makeup helped to overemphasize their expressions . Tsao Yu , eyes wide , said , " Why do you think it t Chou , it turns out , he characters weep with sic moans in the back es the audience : " he good premier of t only for the people .. laces the funeral music audience is overcome . e identity of one side or ) ut the values upheld by - if Chou is depicted as also humane , truthful . would seem that neariti struggle in revolution . ned the Chinese against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you tell ? " He spoke in English , having t time in the States in the thirties , when he had ned to adore the work of O'Neill . His two famous s . Sunrise and Thunderstorm , which I had read a earlier , I found to be impressive tragedies of nghai life in the decaying China of the early thirties . Indeed , Tsao Yu 's professionalism gave me the urity to launch myself insanely into the criticism of Chinese play commonly thought to be a masterk . " I thought , " I replied , " that the story was being told r and possibly five separate times in the first hour . different set of characters repeats it , but they add v little new each time . " Tsao Yu let a split second of silence pass . Then , uting " Hurrah ! " he sprang up while the cast burst to applause and nodded deeply toward me . " Here we e for six months trying to figure out why this play is boring and he sees it once and tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the greatest of pleare blamed their author in a rapid dialogue whose familiar implications I found myself understanding en before Su Kuang could translate them . " Why do n't you stay here for a week and edit it ? " Tsao Yu proposed , and again the actors applauded , nodding encouragement . As we parted , I thought how unique it was that we should have been able to understand one another so easily , and that the theater alone has such universal laws . But of course doctors , too , and phvsicists , and professionals of all kinds live in fundamentally the same worlds , regardless of country or system ; it is our histories that differ so vastly and have left us at such varied levels of achievement , strength , and weakness . Of another sort entirely was the anti-Soviet melodrama Pi-An ( " Another Hope " ) , which we saw in Shanghai . Even in Loyal Hearts one could not help noticing the overacting , apparently a common Chinese failing . A remark that might call for a smile causes its hearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by deep , appreciative nods . What should be a wave of recognition to an acquaintance turns into a bang of the palm on his back and plenty of ha-ha-ha thrown in . There is also the tendency to start a speech facing whomever is supposed to be hearing it and to end it with the speaker facing the audience , whose departure every Chinese actor seems to fear is imminent . It is obviously the operatic tradition , which is venerable and therefore believable , however artificial , while latter-day realism seems to them artificial and unbelievable . In Pi-An there is only the shakiest grip on the realism the play calls for ? although the word " realism " would hardly describe the story , which , apart from its very serious political implications , is or sounds like the @# fantasy of a committee similar to the ones that " create " some of our own television spy or crime dramas . What has to be credited , though , is the mimetic abilities of the Chinese cast , whose imitations of Russians , their demeanor and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps even more amazing is the ballroom dancing by a pair of actors who had never before danced or seen anyone else dancing in that fashion . Playing a Russian who is also doing a close-to-the-girl ballroom number in a chic Swiss hotel is for them the parting of several heavy curtains indeed . The director responsible for these triumphs was Huang Tso Lin , another veteran in his mid-seventies . ( The destruction of the middle generation by the Cultural Revolution has left old men in charge . ) Huang , who hardly speaks above a whisper and moves with all deliberation , spent a year in the thirties in England studying theater with Michel St. Denis . He comes from a wealthy family ( his father was Standard Oil 's man in China ) , his manners are exquisite , and he seems the complete Mandarin in the nobility of his gestures and the slow turnings of his head . He was sent away for three years to feed pigs , study Mao , and confess to his counter-revolutionary dreams . As it happened , Inge and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to Huang 's cell-like room to struggle with him . She now lives in New York and asked us to look up the old man . We had not appreciated the significance of her suggestion until some intensive days of experience in China : in the sixties , she had been one of the young of the Cultural Revolution who were sent in to shake up their elders until the very last of their bourgeois ? or independent ? thoughts had rolled out across the floor and down the drain . When I realized this situation I was totally confused . Surely he must resent what she had done with him ? But to my question he answered in his measured manner , " Not at all . She was never rude to me , she was merely mistaken , as so many were in those days . As I was , in fact . " " In what sense ? " I asked . " I thought Chou was in support of the idea of people like me being sent away ; he must be or it could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to try to rid myself of anti-revolutionary thoughts , even though I did not know that I had any . And , in fact , I did n't have any . It was only in the last two years , in ' 75 and ' 76 , that we knew there was a split and they were trying to destroy us , and the culture , and Chou En-lai . " It was difficult to imagine a man of such dignity feeding pigs and shoveling manure . They must have gotten an extra big kick out of watching him in the mud . I asked him how it was . 115  | " I guess the worst of it , " he smiled , " was seeing my wife every day for three years working in a field across a narrow brook and being forbidden ever to talk to one another . " " And even then did you think Chou would have been behind that ? " " One does n't know what to think after a time . " " Do you think it will ever happen again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite definitely . It will happen many times . But perhaps the next time it will be less destructive of what is needed and good . " He knew the past and it was long , and the future was too , it seemed . There is no tragedy in China perhaps because there is such endless time , stretching out behind and ahead as well . 9 . Mao Tse-tung . Summer Camp Director he marvel of the Chinese condition today is that they have dared to turn upon this godhead Mao , and that within less than two years of his death , they have ceased trying to justify what they know he failed in . The Germans after Hitler did not manage such detachment or such an assumption of responsibility , nor did the Russians after Stalin . But the question remains whether there lies within their grasp , as creatures of China 's history and Marxist rule , the techniques of a democracy that are on so many lips so suddenly . Certain things have surely been learned , among them that under socialism , no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection of his rights by law , and a law that the state too is obliged to obey . Is it conceivable that a Communist party would willingly give up its monopoly of power even to its own judiciary ? Is such a sharing of power not the opening for a second , opposition party ? an anathe-ma ? China has been , for an indeterminate number of years , in a state of anarchy , beyond the control of Mao himself from time to time . He used to say that he did not know how to make socialism work because it had never been done in China , but that he was going to try . He was the Great Improviser , and now it appears that the largest population in the world was governed like a children 's summer camp : the loudest mouths and the purest of the pure and the reddest of the Red took turns whipping the people on with slogan and gun , and a generation was wasted in detention if not literally murdered or driven to suicide . And after thirty years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to advocate birth control ? doubling to nearly a billion , China is on the dire edge of starving again unless a real mechaniza-116 tion of agriculture takes the place of the pr cosmetic one . But what will happen then to displaced millions ? The answer given is new industry in the countryside . We shall see . Despite the charm of her old operas , China a thirty years is a cultural desert . For the artist : t obviously a difficult , impossibly distorting life . that there should be no independent cultural respect to reality deprives the people of direction as well as sense of themselves . Will the Party now resolve to f the artist ? This answer also is unknown , but surely freeing of art opens the way to unorthodoxy and o again requires a political party willing to give a+ part of its power . All the claptrap which Western Marxists and of , liberals taught themselves to despise is now written across the posters on Chang An Avenue . The Chinese have discovered the eighteenth century and the victorious revolutions against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powers of : government and governed . That a peasant or wor sits in the seat of the mighty is no guarantee that will not oppress peasants and workers . The ultima contradiction , thought impossible , came to pass ? : workers and peasants oppressed the workers a. peasants . Nothing is safe from man where there is - ? law . Leaping upward out of China now are rockets a flares and signs and signals of every description , w h the world and the Chinese themselves will be read : . for a long time to come . And one of these is the question of how it happened that this " fascist " government managed to charm correspondent after correspond into a kind of reportage that left no impression of t real magnitude of the Chinese disaster . Was it that t Chinese are so poor and so hardworking that even th self-destructiveness must be mitigated in writing ? Al least this is no longer the prevailing view within China the word " left " in itself will not automatically arouse respect anymore , not when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . China surprised us in a hundred ways , perhaps mos. of all by her pervading beauty . There is an instinct f , - beauty among the Chinese , even in the thoughtless ? a. a woman will arrange a handful of leeks she is washing by a brook , setting them down in a fan shape . The Chinese child is a triumph of humanity , and in the aged there is a sort of dignity that can only come from social respect and a decent tradition . There is also a certain rightness of proportion , a native taste in objects held in the hand . And a poetic tradition inconceivable in the West ? where else in the world is a leader 's calligraphy of importance , and where could it evoke pride that it is elegant ? Indeed , the use of imagery in  | political discourse threatens to turn China into a fairyd for the unwary foreigner . And what other people profoundly understands food ? But none of these charms can distract them from it dilemma anymore . It is repeated and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still holds m . So much so that the very people who say so are the next moment caught in it again , like the vice airman of the Revolutionary Committee of Kweilin , ho emphatically agreed when I asked if their problem as not to guarantee the people 's right to reply to government rather than passively await the announcerent of new lines and tactics . " Oh , yes , " he replied , " it is exactly so . But we a -- -derstand very well that when you address the masses ) u have to repeat the same thing three or four differe-t ways before they understand you . You must be patient with them . " I thought the translation was at fault , and corrected ' : m . " I meant the opposite ? the right of the masses to peak up to government , not the government to the - 'asses . " He was embarrassed , I thought , but that he was seemed encouraging . " Yes , of course , " he said , quite evidently recognizing that his reaction had been as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is an underground literature everywhere in the country , " Hinton had said , but when I asked if its content was democratic he could not say and , knowing China , would not theorize . But no history dies quickly , . is was clear in the gentlemanly old director Huang Tso Lin 's view of art . We had been discussing his and his wife 's incarceration and how impossible it had been for any individual to resist , to speak out against that waste of talented people which was taking place across China . And somehow the conversation had made a quick turn to aesthetics . " Our art must be revolutionary and romantic , " he had said . And that , I knew , was another way of demanding , yet again , an art that would generate popular support for whatever the Party 's line was at the moment , an art whose " romantic " nature meant that it would not stand as witness to reality and life but would project an " ideal " of what should and would be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a decent old man was ready to cut the country off from those images of reality which art can most vividly create , and which at their profound best toughen a nation 's spirit against self-pity and self-delusion and may , as has happened , cry up warnings of calamity in good time . Worse yet , this theory of art was devised to serve Power , though in effect it was also Chinese tradition that the captive imperial artist help justify to the people the works and ways of Power . But an art of witness rather than of romance would also challenge the Party , at least as it now constituted in its monopoly . We happened totally by accident to arrive in China at the moment when , it would seem , all romance was over and the time had come to face hard facts . Mao apparently acted out his own prediction of 1962 and , failing to democratize China , sank into a kind of tyranny himself . But , as with Inge 's photographs ? taken with no such idea in mind ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mao is the past now , and , in true Chinese fashion , the further away he is carried by time , the larger he will loom in the mind . Already one can not help grinning at the irony of his having invented and preached a kind of endless overthrowing , a ceaseless renewal , a perpetual revolution ? even against himself . In death his preachment has rooted itself at last in the act of throwing him down in the minds of the people ; at least to this degree they are putting behind them the age-old obedience to masters and docility , the toadying to the powerful which he hated in them . Is this , then , his ultimate victory ? ? that he has at last made himself unnecessary ? There indeed would be an irony , for in that case his people will need him forever .
