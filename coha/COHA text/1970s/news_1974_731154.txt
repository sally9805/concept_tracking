txt MARTIN LUTHER King 's memory was observed without tears yesterday by a group of school children at a prebirthday party in the American Indian Center , 1630 W. Wilson Av . " Martin 's birthday should be a happy day , " said Mrs. Marion Beach , coordinator of the party . " Just as the happiest day in Christendom is the birthday of Jesus . Martin was also a great gift to the world . " The party was held yesterday because public schools will be closed today in King 's memory , she said . THE PARTY was attended by 20 children from Cameron School , 1234 N. Monticello Av. , who received portraits of the civil rights leader who was slain Aug. 4 , 1968 , in Memphis . The children played games , sang songs with Appalachian poet Doug Youngblood , and had their own portraits drawn by free-lance artists . When asked about Dr. King s life , the children said they remembered him but were not sure about all the facts . " Dr. King was a great man , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot about two years ago , was n't he ? " " He died before that , " argued Darryl Pernel , II . ' ' l saw it on television . He marched from Memphis to , uh , somewhere and freed a lot of people . " ' tIltS . BEACH , who said she was half-black and halfIndian and had marched with Dr. King , set them straight : " Dr. King spent his life working so that children like you can have a better life ; so you can live together peacefully regardless of race or creed . His work will not die , will it ? " " Not as long as we remember him ! " a boy answered proudly .
