Awakened from a deep sleep , it is independent , unpredictable , tough to lead <P> The silver and ebony mace , an emblem of congressional authority , has been placed on its green marble pedestal behind the rostrum in the House of Representatives . Quill pens , symbolic links with a more genteel past , have been sharpened in the Senate , where they are available to any member . At high noon this Thursday , Jan. 19 , Speaker Tip O'Neill in the House and Vice President Walter Mondale in the Senate will smartly rap their gavels on the polished desks before them . Thus will begin the second session of the 95th Congress , one of the boldest and balkiest in memory . <P> The traditions and rituals of opening day have not changed much in 189 years , but in far more substantive ways this is a vastly different Congress from those of the past . More than half of its members-61 Senators and 231 Representatives-were first elected within the past nine years ; more than one-third of them have been in office for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent-of both their own leaders and the White House-they are continuing the congressional revolution that started as a reaction to the tragic mistakes of Viet Nam and Richard Nixon 's imperial presidency .

Only five years ago , Congress was the sick man of the Federal Government . For 40 years , power had shifted down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House ; the movement accelerated rapidly under Nixon , who essentially operated on his own in making budgets and war . At regional conferences sponsored by TIME in 1972 , scholars , civic leaders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the balance , the U.S. was facing a grave constitutional crisis that threatened the future of democracy . <P> But within a year Congress was fighting back . It passed the symbolically important War Powers Act , which placed tight restrictions on a President 's powers to dispatch U.S. troops abroad . It set up the Congressional Budget Office , which , together with the newly expert House and Senate budget committees , acts as a sort of economic shadow cabinet . At the same time , members of Congress developed a new self-confidence and a sense that sound policy can-and should-originate on Capitol Hill as well as in the White House .
