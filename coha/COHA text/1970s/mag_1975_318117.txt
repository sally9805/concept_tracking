" Boss " Tweed , corrupt Tammany chief of the 1860s , raised little objection when muckraking reporters prowled city hall . What the papers wrote had no meaning , Tweed liked to boast ; his constituency was illiterate . The only criticism that ever bothered or threatened him , the Boss confessed , was " them damn pictures . " <P> Thomas Nast 's editorial cartoons were worth fearing ; the savage caricatures showed Tweed variously as a vulture , a bag of money and , when Nast had sufficiently aroused the civic conscience , a felon in prison stripes . <P> A century of history has brought little change . Corruption is still ubiquitous-but so , happily , is the editorial cartoon , grinning out from banks of gray prose . In about 16 square inches , that journalistic institution still manages to encapsulate crises , expose pretensions and eviscerate swollen egos-all with a few well-drawn strokes . Two new paperback editions underscore the point . On the far side of history , Thomas Nast : Cartoons &; Illustrations ( Dover ) reveals a mature artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mordant wit of Twain . His meticulous crosshatching created three ineradicable symbols : the Democratic Donkey , the Republican Elephant and the Tammany Tiger . Nast 's gentler conceptions of John Bull , Uncle Sam and even Santa Claus are the ones that most artists still sedulously ape . On the near side , Herblock ' s State of the Union ( Viking/Compass ) presents the dean of contemporary cartoonists , Herbert Block , drawing-and quartering-his favorite quarry : Government waste , pomposity , fat-cat lobbyists , and last and by all means lost , the Nixon Administration . <P> Between these two masters , a hundred years ' worth of artists have passed in review . A few remain in the memory because of a Pulitzer Prize or an anthologized work ; the bulk have been forgotten . Yet anyone who peruses ancient journals knows that if nothing is as old as yesterday 's news , nothing seems fresher than its editorial cartoon . In satirizing events and event makers , the cartoon refines material until only the ridiculous essence remains . Circumstances impossible in the real world are staged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face with his broken promises , hypocrisy assumes a human face , fingers are pointed , blame is fixed , responsibility attached to recognizable figures . <P> Such onslaughts have their liabilities . The cartoon 's first obligation is to be pithy ; faces and facts may be stretched to fit a gag . Editorial artists work best against rather than for something , and not every issue is as black and white as the drawing proclaims . That lack of shading and subtlety obviously influenced New York Times Founder Adolph Ochs when he kept sketches from his paper 's editorial page-a tradition that is maintained today . " A cartoon , " Ochs is said to have complained , " can not say ' On the other hand . ' " On the other hand , a cartoon can do what prose cannot.
