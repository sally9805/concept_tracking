An American psychiatrist examines some murderous M.D.s <P> Of all the troubling questions that linger from the Holocaust , one is as baffling today as it was when the first Allied soldiers stumbled upon the Nazi death camps : How could German physicians , heirs to Europe 's proudest medical tradition , participate in mass slaughter and grisly human experiments ? <P> No one has offered a convincing answer , certainly not the participants themselves . Only last week a West Berlin court convicted a former SS doctor of having murdered scores of inmates at the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria- " sometimes out of pure boredom , " said the judge . For Yale Psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton , who has spent much of his professional life examining disaster , understanding the doctors of the Holocaust has now become a particularly grim challenge . <P> The author of a notable study of Hiroshima survivors , Death in Life , and other examinations of disaster , Lifton is writing two books : one on Auschwitz doctors , another on the medical profession under Hitler .

Two years ago , the New York Times Book Co. , a subsidiary of the newspaper , hired a German jurist as a consultant for a proposed book on Auschwitz . Lifton agreed to write it . <P> Financed by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Rockefeller Foundation , Lifton spent ten months in Europe and the Middle East interviewing scores of German doctors , former Nazi bureaucrats and inmate doctors , mostly Jewish and Polish . <P> For Lifton , a Jew , these examinations were obviously painful . Even a generation later , Lifton found , many of the German doctors resorted to complicated mental gymnastics in discussing their Hitler days , and often seemed to be almost totally unreconstructed .

As Lifton explains , in an almost defensively clinical tone : " Often the former Nazi doctors seem to have two separate and functional selves-a conventional conservative postwar German attitude toward Nazism and its ' excesses ' and a nostalgia for the excitement , power and sense of purpose of the Nazi days . For many , that intensity is so great that the Nazi belief system has not been given up . "
