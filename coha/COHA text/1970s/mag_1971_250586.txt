For an auto-parts company , Midas-International used to be a remarkable place to work . At its Chicago headquarters , Bach chamber music wafted from hidden loudspeakers , while Technicolor-plumed finches twittered in a giant cage . The boss , bumper-bald Gordon Sherman , 43 , was in the office round the clock some days-and other days scarcely at all . A man of intense energy and occasional brilliance , he often worked at home , where he also liked to tend his orchids and hummingbirds or tootle his oboe and English horn . Occasionally he held executive meetings at a zoo , or in the office by candlelight . " A certain truth comes out at night that does n't come out in the board room , " he explained . <P> The whole stress in the company , as one former executive put it , was not so much on working hard and filling up time as on working smart and solving problems . Some of Sherman 's executives were psychologists and sociologists , whom he had recruited with want ads in the Saturday Review and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman , but you ca n't necessarily teach him to communicate , " he said . " But if you take a man who somehow has learned to excel in the skills of communication , put him in a business suit and pay him a fair salary , then in short order he 'll learn to read a financial statement . " <P> Barrage from the Board . This unstructured management approach did not go over well with the company 's founder and major stockholder , 72-year-old Nate Sherman , who is Gordon Sherman 's father . Nate had started the firm in 1938 , become known for dependable wholesale distribution in a generally haphazard field , and prospered in the postwar auto boom . He built the business into a $3.5-million-a-year operation by the time Son Gordon joined the organization in 1950 . Gordon promoted the idea of starting Midas Muffler Shops - franchised retail outlets with specialists in trim uniforms . The Midas idea caught on quickly , and after sales hit $42 million in 1967-much of it from the muffler shops-Gordon laid down an ultimatum : he would resign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reluctantly , Nate assented and stepped up to the chairmanship . <P> From his seat on the board , however , Nate kept up a steady barrage of criticism of his son 's business methods . Last fall Gordon Sherman yielded to the sniping and resigned . But in March he mounted a proxy challenge that has acquired overtones of a Greek tragedy and a war of conflicting management philosophies . <P> Edifice Complex . As the battle neared a climax last week , the charges and countercharges flew fast . Gordon said that his father was dismantling the team that had led Midas to success . Since Gordon left the presidency , seven executives have been fired and another eight have resigned . Gordon argues that his father is too aged to run the company and that " his management is attuned to a small wholesale auto-parts distribution company . " Adds Gordon : " The old man just wo n't let go . "
