 | The job of chasing after a toddler is an experience no mother forgets . Prying , pulling , chewing , the child darts like a lightning bug , and always in the wrong direction . Turn your back for a moment , and the ashtray has been dumped on the floor , the garbage pail upended , and a favorite magazine is being shredded . It 's that awful/lovable age when he 's too big to stay put , and too little to keep out of danger . If you remember one toddler as trouble , just picture two at a time . Now expand the nightmare by adding a third toddler , a  | fourth , a fifth ? each active , agile , inquisitive . It boggles the mind of anyone ? except 32-year-old Peggy Jo Kienast of Liberty Corner , N.J. Peggy Jo 's quintuplets ? Amy , Abigail , Sara , Gordon and Ted ? became 17 months old on July 24 . Caring for this brood is always at least five times the headache that one would be , but sometimes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , the matter of shoes . To the casual eye , all five pair of quintuplet shoes look alike , but actually each is a different size , and the range between Amy 's , the smallest , and Gordon 's , the largest , a full size and a half . It takes patience to put ten little feet into the high white shoes , to tighten and tie the laces . But even a saint 's patience is tried when the shoes get mixed up , and a helping grandmother works in vain to squeeze Sara 's squirming feet into Abigail 's shoes , a half-size too small . Then there 's the small problem of odor . When a certain smell pervades the playpen , any mother knows to pick up her child and change his soiled diaper . But with the quintuplets , there 's the question ? as Peggy Jo puts it ? which one is the stinker in the crowd ? She has to give a tentative sniff to each of five before she finds and dashes upstairs with the offending culprit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bill Kienast consider their major challenge ? to foster the budding individuality of each of the five . Peggy Jo never describes her crew as quintuplets , because it presupposes a group identity of which she disapproves . " We have seven children , " she recently told a reporter from the Bernardsville ( N.J. ) News . " We do n't have two children and quintuplets . " ( The older two are Meg , five , and John , three , and all seven were born with the aid of fertility drugs . ) Peggy Jo 's daily routine would be easier if the quintuplets were all plumped in the roomy outdoor play yard , which has a sandbox , or in the toystrewn indoor play area , which takes up most of the family 's former dining room . But ease is not what the Kienasts are looking for . Peggy Jo may keep three in the enclosure at a time , but she 's likely to take a fourth with her as she goes about her morning chores , and hand a fifth to Cynthia Kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February . It would also be easier to hold all five to an identical rigid schedule , but that , too , is not the way it 's done . If Ted wakes early from his nap , he is brought downstairs alone to keep his mother company as she cleans up the luncheon dishes . Because allowing a toddler to explore on his own is a oneto-one proposition , Peggy Jo enlists as surrogate mother any adult or teen-ager who happens to walk through her front door . Her feeders ? neighbor-volunteers who have helped with the noon meal ever since the babies came home from the hospital ? are still very much in evidence . And on the occasional day when there 's not a full complement of four volunteers , she does n't hesitate to telephone a friend to fill in . This is n't for her convenience , but for the sake of the five . The volunteers now arrive at 11 : 45 A.M. to clean up their charges before lunch , and leave at nap time , almost two hours later . When the quintuplets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their laps . Now each sits in front of a high chair at lunchtime , then chases across the lawn after her charge , or splashes with him on the steps of the family swimming pool . To give the five even more freedom during the summer months , Peggy Jo has supplemented her volunteer staff with teen-age sitters . When 15-yearold Nancy Velsor arrives , she 's likely to pluck Abigail from the enclosed yard for a 15-minute romp , and then return her to give Sara a turn . When Nancy is n't available , Maureen Smith , 17 , often fills in . ( Maureen started quintuplet-sitting to win a Girl Scout child-care bar , but keeps coming because she finds the five so much fun . ) Then there are individual outings . Each quintuplet has had a sleepover date of his own at the Westfield , N.J. , home of Jean Boone , Bill 's sister , and her husband , Olin . Now Jean , who dotes on her nieces and nephews , is starting a second round . Peggy Jo often takes one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . Amy was a bit timid at first about riding in the grocery cart , but the others have loved it right from the start . ( It 's a peck more trouble to take all five to the shoe store , an expedition which requires five aides ,  | including one who arrives in advance to hold a convenient parking slot . ) Another couple might have blanched at driving seven children , aged one to five , 50 miles to a birthday party , but Peggy Jo and Bill feel that families are made to have outings together . When Tom Ratcliffe , Peggy Jo 's brother , suggested a joint celebration in March of Meg 's fifth birthday and his thirty-fourth at his home in Locust , N.J. , Peggy Jo responded , " Gosh , that ought to be fun . " And so it was , despite the lengthy preparations required . On the way down the quintuplets peered eagerly out of the station-wagon windows ; they slept peacefully coming back . Tom and Susan Ratcliffe have their own problems with two small children less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got rid of us , I 'm sure Sue really appreciated how easy she has it , " Peggy Jo observes . Emboldened by success , the Kienasts threw their own family party in late April at the Episcopal church of St. John on the Mountain in Bernardsville , playing host to the other parishioners at a coffee hour following Sunday service . " These are the people who have been so great to us , " Peggy Jo explains . Church members make up the core of the quintuplets ' feeding brigade . For this , the first public appearance of the five since their christening a year earlier , timing was planned down to the split second . First Bill left early for church with Meg and John . Then Peggy Jo , with a friend 's aid , drove the quintuplets over , arriving just as the service ended . The five looked entrancing , the boys in one-piece blue knit outfits , the girls in aqua dresses with pleated skirts . Everyone wanted to hold them , and the small children of the parish vied in lugging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Are the quintuplets often on display ? " one man asked . " My children are never on display , " Peggy Jo retorted tartly . With such determined effort , it is not surprising that each quintuplet is distinctly himself . The five ( none are genetically identical ) do not even look alike , although all have huge blue eyes . Gordon is the largest , almost six pounds heavier than sister Amy , the smallest . The boys are towheads , and the girls ' hair , sandy-colored . Sara 's hair is the longest , curling almost to her shoulders . First to walk , Abigail is the most adventuresome ( and usually has a bruise on her forehead ) , Sara the most aggressive , and Amy the joyous one . On the rare occasions when Amy cries , " she does n't even really do it right , " her mother observes . Both boys are more obvious than the girls in their bids for attention . When a visitor enters and all five dash ? like five puppies in a pet shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to let out a wail to be picked up ( and to quiet the minute he 's gotten his way ) . Ted is the most affectionate ; he snuggles up and curls his arms around the neck of any visitor who holds him . Gordon 's fingers are already too nimble for comfort . Recently his parents had to move him from the crib next to the light switch , because even when they covered the switch with a childproof plastic guard , they were likely to find the nursery lights ablaze at three o'clock in the morning . Each his own person , the five are still uniquely a group , the second youngest of the ten sets of quintuplets who have ever survived infancy . ( The Kienasts were supplanted as the world 's youngest quints by the arrival on May 12 in Gdansk , Poland , of three boys and two girls to Mr. and Mrs. Bronislaw Rychert . ) Only a few months ago the quintuplets appeared to regard each other as objects , to be crawled over and pummeled like any other stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real camaraderie of a primitive sort . Gordon , who still loves his pacifier , grins amiably as Sara stretches over from her back-to-back crib and , teasing , snatches it from his mouth . Ted bangs a ball and a block together , and Amy , enchanted , follows suit with two blocks . Abigail claps her hands and the others imitate . They croon together , giggle , and practice baby syllables in unison . If one receives favored treatment , the others appear curiously unaffected . Noisy Gordon is the most likely to be picked up and allowed to wander outside the pen , but this does n't trip off wails for attention from the other four . Some day they may suffer from sibling rivalry , but so far nothing of the sort is apparent . If one wakes early from his nap and plays alone downstairs , he 's likely to crow with delight when the first brother or sister joins him . The babies even take turns standing on a cushion which they 've lugged to the window in order to peer outdoors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for . Their prematurity long since outgrown , the quintuplets are developing physically much like other children their age . ( The volunteer feeders maintain that all are unusually bright . ) They walk steadily , babble constantly , and even say a tentative word or two . Ted was the first to name an object ; at 14 months he pointed to a toy parrot perched on a window lintel in the nursery , and said , " Birdie . " They like to upend empty boxes and try to fit one container inside another . All drink neatly from a cup , although Ted , particularly eager for his milk , may splash his fat-creased neck with droplets . On cue from the five , Peggy Jo changed their breakfast and supper routine a few months ago . Previously , these meals were a thin gruel of cereal , fruit and milk , which the quints drank themselves in their cribs from baby bottles with wide nipples . It was far easier for their mother , but when they started to break the stems off the feeders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to tell us something . " Now all three meals are served in the dining room where the flooring , still unfinished , is impervious to damage . The five finger-feed their sandwich-andcold-meat supper . ( Squishy liverwurst is a particular favorite , to be squeezed with delight through the fingers . ) At breakfast Peggy Jo and Cynthia , with considerable help from Meg , move from chair to chair in assembly-line fashion , spooning in scrambled eggs and cereal . Despite the mess it makes , the five are enccuraged to feed themselves part of a meal , although a small fist is still just as likely as a small spoon to land in a bowl of meat and vegetables . In one area ? social adaptability ? the quintuplets do not follow the pattern of their age group . Early in their second year , most babies become wary of strangers . " I think 13 months is the most suspicious age of all , " Dr. Spock says . Some day he ought to meet the Kienast quintuplets ! Brought up kibbutz-style from infancy , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pen with squeals of delight no matter who the visitor . No toddlers are sunnier than these five . . Yet , despite their many substitute mothers , when a quint , sitting in his high chair awaiting his lunch , chants " mamama , " his eyes seek out Peggy Jo , not the feeder tying his bib . And on a rainy day , when the youngsters are set free in the kitchen to explore the fascinating boxes and cans in the low cabinets , they 're likely to congregate around their mother , seated on the floor . This is a moment which Peggy Jo enjoys . One day , with four of them sprawling over her , she illustrated the principle of insideness by placing a small freezer jar inside a larger one . and dropping a tiny doll in the smaller jar . " Right now encouraging their curiosity is the most important thing , " she says . " My heavens , we mothers have a job to do . We ca n't just sit around and look at our babies . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily traversed as Grand Central Station also extend to Meg and John . There is no such thing as a shy Kienast child , nor will there probably ever be . Long before his third birthday in August , John could distinguish ? often by name ? between the many  | visitors to his home . " I have n't seen you in a long time , " was his opening gambit recently as a reporter arrived after a hiatus of several months . Only 18 months older than the quints , John is now getting to know them as little brothers and sisters , not as untouchables , and he is thriving on it . Because he no longer persists in pushing them down , their play area is not off limits to him any more , and he often plays happily with the five . He appears to have made some kind of peace with sibling rivalry times five , and particularly enjoys helping to bathe the toddlers . At five , Meg , an unusually mature little girl , is preparing to enter kindergarten . " Unconsciously we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is , " Peggy Jo says , " and she seldom fails to deliver . I think she 's spoiling us . " She loves to move from crib to crib playing her own big-sister games . " Ah da , " she says to Abigail , putting her hands over her face . " Ah da , " responds Abigail , imitating the gesture . Despite their awesome schedule with the seven , Peggy Jo and Bill somehow manage to participate as active members of their community . To some neighbors this comes as a surprise . Recently when one received a letter from Peggy Jo , appealing for funds for a church-sponsored horse show , he grumbled , " Has n't she anything better to do with her time ? " The Kienasts donate a pint of blood each year when the bloodmobile arrives , and are loyal supporters of the local recycling drive . This is no small task for Peggy Jo , who saves 75 empty baby-food jars each week and even finds time to wash and scrub the label off each . The Kienasts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been an at-home time ; they prefer it that way . " For us it 's a party if we get a bunch of people here , " Peggy Jo says . Seven guests for dinner might be a nervous occasion for some women , but she shrugs it off as an ordinary evening . Recently , on only one day 's notice , she served a group this size a lamb curry , and for dessert a flaming cherries jubilee . Naturally , there were lace mats and candles and a charming flower centerpiece . But many of Peggy Jo 's parties do n't stop at seven guests . In the spring she and her brother played host at the Kienast home to 35 people , gathered for a surprise dinner in honor of the retirement from a large grocery chain of their father , French Ratcliffe . ( Although he is now 65 , Grandfather Ratcliffe 's " retirement " is largely focused on helping Bill with the still-unfinished new wing of the Kienast home . ) It was a tense evening for Peggy Jo , although few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quints developed high fevers at suppertime and were unusually querulous and demanding . ( The illness turned out to be the flu , and all five were sick for a week . ) Yet a dinner for 35 was only a curtain-raiser for Peggy Jo . Almost single-handedly she organized a bigger blast , a Fourth-of-July picnic supper for more than 100 guests to celebrate Bill 's fortieth birthday . How does the mother of seven small children throw a party of such magnitude ? Partly by making and freezing gallons of barbecue beef in advance , partly by placing kegs of beer across the lawn so that guests may help themselves , but mostly by just being her own easygoing ( but quietly efficient ) self . Part of the Kienasts ' secret is to appear relaxed even when they do n't feel that way . Neither Peggy Jo nor Bill ever whine about the problems they do have . Bill said little , but felt deeply when his mother , Mrs. Margate Kienast , died in February at the age of 74 . During a month 's terminal illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many chores , he made a round trip of 70 miles to see her almost daily . " We were all depressed . It drained everyone 's energy , " Peggy Jo says . Business decisions have been another concern . In recent months Bill has been deep in negotiations for the formation of a small company to manufacture plastics for eyeglasses . One of his jobs has been to raise several hundred thousand dollars for financing . The Kienasts hope that the new business will be in full swing by late fall . " People are always asking how we manage financially , " Bill says . " With my own business I have no doubt I 'll make enough money to support us all . " Misconceptions about the Kienast financial status are widespread . Many people assume that once quintuplets are born to a couple , their money problems vanish overnight . " But does n't the government support them ? " curious friends by the score have asked this reporter . When assured that the Kienasts instead help support the government by paying their income taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rake in advertising contracts ? " There is good reason for this confusion , because most quintuplet families have been substantially aided either by their government , by contributions from the public , or by lucrative longterm commercial contracts . By their first birthday , the five Dionne girls , born in 1934 , had a bank account of $175,000 and a staff of nine to care for them . The Prietos of Venezuela , born in 1963 , and the Tukuteses of South Africa , born in 1966 , were each supplied a nurse , a new home , and the income from a trust fund . In 1969 a newspaper chain is reported to have paid the English Hansons almost $100,000 for exclusive rights to their story . Although the five Fischers of South Dakota ? the only other American quintuplets ? received no government subsidy , business contracts brought the family a reputed annual income of $80,000 during their early years . Compared to this largesse , the Kienasts have been the only go-it-alone quintuplet parents financially ( except for the already-wealthy Diligentis of Argentina ) . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ netted them about $25. - 000 during the babies ' first year , and $10,000 so far this year ? paltry sums  | by quintuplet standards . But because Peggy Jo and Bill did not anticipate wealth , they have not been disappointed that it has not materialized . They were deeply embarrassed by an NBC First Tuesday program last April , which erroneously described a Kienast " dream of becoming rich . " " I certainly do n't feel that anyone owes us a thing just because we had five babies at once , " Bill says . Peggy Jo adds , " Our children are much more valuable to us than money . " If offers come , the Kienasts are willing to endorse commercial products , but strictly on their own terms . The first consideration is their children . " We have no intention of subjecting them to any rigorous ordeal , " says Peggy Jo . " The minute we feel they 're tired , that 's going to be it . " ( She recently wrote a polite no-thank-you to Mayor Richard Daley who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) An equally important consideration is the product itself . " If we do n't believe in something , we 're certainly not going to get involved in publicizing it , " Peggy Jo says . It 's no surprise to other young parents that the Kienasts ' expenses are growing faster than their children . With the washing machine and dryer running at least twice daily , the electricity bill alone has jumped from about $13 to $40 a month . During one winter month , they paid a heating bill of $185 , compared to $50 in a comparable month the previous year , before the house had been expanded . The largest outlay ? close to $100 weekly ? goes to their full-time children 's helper , and to part-time babysitters . Shoes alone promise to take a huge chunk out of the budget . The Kienasts spent almost $50 for the quintuplets ' first five pairs , and then were offered free shoes for a year , and a 20 percent discount thereafter by the Castle Bootery in Westfield . Even with the discount , four pairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require at first ? adds up to an annual expenditure of $160 , Other generous gifts will soon be outgrown . Dress-up clothes are now donated by the Nannette Manufacturing Company of Philadelphia , but before long the five will no longer fit into the toddler sizes this company manufactures . On ordinary days the quints usually wear hand-me-down overalls and T-shirts from Meg and John , and from their little cousins , the Ratcliffes . About 75 jars of junior and toddler foods consumed weekly by the five come without charge from the Gerber Products Company , but as the youngsters ' diet gradually shifts to ordinary table food , the Kienasts will be shouldering more of this expense . They already pay for milk ? 17 half-gallons a week at a cost of about $10 . Although they do not covet wealth , the Kienasts nevertheless hope there will be enough money available to raise their children according to the standards they consider important . To ensure privacy for their famous five , they would like to double the four acres of land they now own and fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine so that none of the seven is shortchanged emotionally while Peggy Jo copes with the tyranny of 27 meals daily , nine beds to be made and mountains of wash to be sorted and put away . Recently when Meg was preparing to go to a birthday party , a friend offered to dash out to the store and buy a gift for her small hostess . " But of course not , " said Peggy Jo , surprised . " I 'll take Meg to buy the present . I always have . " Essentially , this is what Peggy Jo intends to give her children ? individual time and attention so that each feels she is his mother , not merely a chore-ridden nursemaid . Her success in this endeavor is already astonishing . Not long ago a new volunteer feeder watched wide-eyed as Peggy Jo went about her tasks , pausing effortlessly for a hug here , a pat there , a moment 's play , a private joke . " I raised four children , " the volunteer exclaimed , " and I never seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy Jo enjoys all seven ? and that 's the way she intends to keep it .
