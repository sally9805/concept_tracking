Journalists are acutely aware of one characteristic of the terrorist of the ' 70s : however small his numbers or narrow his cause , he commands attention . Our Bonn bureau , which provided much of the reporting for this week 's cover stories on the international terrorism phenomenon , is a case in point . <P> Over the past seven months alone , Bureau Chief William Mader and Correspondent Barrett Seaman have reported nine stories involving West Germany 's continuing struggle with radical violence , including the kidnaping of the since murdered industrial leader , Hanns-Martin Schleyer . Following the Schleyer abduction , terrorism became what Mader describes as a " prime preoccupation " of the bureau as it prepared to cover further developments that were sure to come-and did , with great drama , last week . Says Mader : " Tragically , the likelihood is that we will face more such stories . " <P> Part of our account of the safe rescue of the passengers and crew members being held hostage aboard Lufthansa 's hijacked Flight 181 at Mogadishu , the Somali capital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Halevy obtained from an Israeli short-wave radio enthusiast a tape recording of fragments of the communications he had monitored . They were between Flight 181 , two other planes carrying the West German negotiator and anti-terrorist commandos , Lufthansa headquarters and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt 's crisis group , which was directing the operation . <P> Photographers Catherine Leroy and Henri Bureau happened to be in Mogadishu on assignment for TIME when the hijacked plane arrived there from Southern Yemen early Monday morning . That day , they photographed the grim scene at the airport as the body of the slain pilot was removed from the plane . They then decided to wait around at the field , on a hunch that Flight 181 's four-day odyssey was about to reach a climax . Reports Leroy : " We knew something was coming up at 1:30 a.m. when the Somali police pushed us to a corner of the airport right behind the first-aid center . Later , it happened : gunfire echoed through the darkness for several minutes - they seemed like hours - then silence . " <P> She and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been aboard the plane reached the airport operations building . Says Leroy : " I lived at that airport for 24 hours . The rescue was one of the most emotional events I have ever covered . "
