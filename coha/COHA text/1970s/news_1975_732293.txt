txt The American Government , American business , and American citizens appear to be getting deeply involved in the raging civil war in Angola . Ironically , these American elements are aiding and bankrolling opposing sides . And the administration 's own reported undercover operation is the target of strong criticism from some members of Congress and , apparently , from within the State Department itself . This U.S. involvement at varied levels is neither so well known nor perhaps so vast as Soviet and Cuban military aid to the leftist Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) whose Luanda-based " government " has been recognized by at least 13 black African countries . But its scope is becoming daily more evident : ? Gulf Oil Company , which has oil wells in the MPLA-controlled enclave of Cabinda , has confirmed that it has handed over hundreds of millions of dollars this year in royalty and tax payments to the Luanda-based " tax collector of the State of Angola . " The latest payment ( about $100 million ) was made in September when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister Saydi Mingas , according to highly reliable sources , has confirmed receipt of this payment . ? Hundreds of Americans have responded to newspaper advertisements calling for mercenaries for action in Africa . One advertiser , David Bufkin of Fresno , California , told this correspondent that he himself had dispatched nearly 100 Americans to join the Angolan liberation movements fighting against the MPLA . According to Mr. Bufkin , a California crop duster , most of these combat veterans headed for Angola via South Africa . A few went via Zaire . The initial funds ( about $800 to $1,200 per person travel costs ) , he said , came from Africa . He reckoned a total of about 300 Americans had left for Angola over the past month or two . . . American officials say that the FBI is investigating the matter . Recruiting American citizens to serve in a foreign army is illegal under Title 18 of the U.S. Code . ? The Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) also has been recruiting Americans with combat experience , in this case , blacks , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CORE 's international department , inisists that the aim is solely to provide medical assistance ? " It 's entirely peaceful , nonmilitary , humanitarian involvement . " Mr. Fitzhohn estimates that some 500 to 600 unpaid volunteers will be recuited as " medics " at a cost to CORE of from $100,000 to $1 million . He categorically denied a Newsday ( Long Island ) report that said that Central Intelligence Agency sources claimed CORE was recruiting for the CIA . ? According to a New York Times story published last week , a high-ranking U.S. // *American involvement in Angola 's war deepens // Government official said that the United States has already sent $25 million in arms and support funds to Angola over the last three months and plans to send another $25 million . The funds and military supplies were said to have been distributed by the CIA via Zaire to the two uneasily ailed factions fighting the MPLA ? the FNLA ( National Front ) and UNITA ( National Movement ) . State Department sources subsequently would neither confirm nor deny the report . The official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Kissinger Nov. 28 : " The United States will not intervene militarily in Angola . " However , a further New York Times report Sunday said that the August resignation of Nathaniel Davis , head of the State Department 's Bureau of African Affairs , was made in protest against the Kissinger-sponsored growing U.S. covert involvement . Mr. Davis 's recommendation of a purely diplomatic ap proach to Angola was said to have been rejected . The Gulf Oil concession agreement with Angola calls for royalty and tax payments this year of some $500 million ? abut half Angola 's total foreign-exchange earnings in a normal year . The company 's 120 Cabinda wells have been pumping at near-normal rates ( about 140,000 barrels a day ) most of the year despite the war . About 100 foreign personnel , including some 50 Americans , are at work there . MPLA troops occupied the installations for only one day and now control the area from outside them . Gulf Spokesmen deny that the company 's quarterly payments have been made to the MPLA . But that is clearly the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of earlier payments Angola had a shaky " transitional " coalition government of all three factions plus the Portuguese . But the MPLA 's Mr. Mingas was finance minister then , too . Mr. Mingas is reported to have remarked recently that MPLA 's relations with Gulf were " very good . " And Gulf is said to have quietly communicated to the State Department its concern about U.S. intervention on the other side . Gulf now has a major problem on its hands : what to do about the next quarterly payment due at the end of this month ? Since the September payment , the MPLA has declared independence ( Nov. 11 ) and set itself up as the official government in the capital , Luanda . There is no longer any conceivable doubt as to who would receive the next check ? if it goes to the usual address in Luanda . The U.S. administration also has a problem , in this case of maintaining its alleged covert supply of funds and materiel to the anti-MPLA forces . Concerned both about a burgeoning , possibly Vietnam-type U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African aid to the anti-MPLA groups , some U.S. senators and representatives are voicing opposition . The Senate foreign-relations subcommittee on assistance is scheduled Tuesday to debate an amendment by Sen. Dick Clark ( D ) of Iowa to the Government 's security-assistance bill . This would have the effect of bringing any such CIA disbursements under congressional control . CORE , too , is finding Angola a prickly assignment . Mr. Fitzjohn says that Core wishes to retain a neutral mediatory stance throughout its involvement . Yet the plan to send hundreds of black volunteers into Angola flowed from a CORE official 's attendance at the UNITA-FNLA independence celebrations . CORE did not attend the MPLA celebrations , although Mr. Fitzjohn says that it is in contact with the MPLA , too .
