A slow " go " for high school competency exams <P> On 58th Street south of Tampa , Fla. , where the houses thin out and the land turns to strawberry and tomato fields , lives Gary Berrien , 17 , one of ten children of Ezell , a roofer , and Mildred , an organist at the nearby New Progress Missionary Baptist Church . Gary plays the organ for pay on Sunday at three churches in the neighborhood , but he has not found a full-time job since completing the twelfth grade at Hillsborough High School . He wanted to join the Army but decided against it when a recruiter asked for his high school diploma . Gary had to tell him he did not have a diploma because he had failed to pass the Florida functional literacy test , which this year became a requirement for graduating from high school . Gary had not expected that failure ; he had received passing grades for twelve straight years in public school . <P> Gary 's mathematics teacher in the ninth grade , Bobby Crihfield , recalls that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is passed along from grade to grade . " Unaware of Gary 's musical ability or his skill in carpentry and woodcarving , Crihfield says he has seen many such students who " reach a plateau once they get to the seventh grade , and they just ca n't learn any more . I think it 's just unfair to try to make them graduate from high school . " <P> But Gary 's parents , who say they never received a call or letter about his schoolwork from any of Gary 's teachers , see things differently . Says his father : " If he 's slow in learning , then I think you should hold him back . Even my little ones-if I do n't discipline them early , then I 'm going to have problems later . Have they ever asked themselves how a teacher could give a student a passing grade for each of the years he went to school , and then he gets to the eleventh grade and they tell him he 's functionally illiterate because he ca n't pass this test ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a diploma be awarded to Gary , and to others among the 3,445 blacks and 1,342 whites who flunked the literacy test after three tries but were otherwise eligible for graduation . In the first federal court ruling on the new wave of minimal competency graduation requirements , which have been adopted in various forms by 17 states , Judge Carr upheld the graduation requirements in general , but ruled that the Florida program was imposed too hastily . Florida 's mandatory literacy test was announced in 1977 , while this year 's seniors were sophomores . Carr said students should have been told that graduation depended on functional literacy skills " at the time of instruction , " well before their sophomore year . Florida , he ordered , could require a passing grade on the test beginning in the 1982-83 school year . <P> In addition , the judge held that the test discriminated against blacks , most of whom attended segregated schools in Florida as recently as 1971 . At first , 77% of blacks failed the literacy test , compared with 24% of whites ; after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2% of whites still had not passed . " The vestiges of the inferior elementary education blacks received still are present and affect their performance , " said Carr .
