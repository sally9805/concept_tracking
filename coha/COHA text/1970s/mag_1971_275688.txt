Anyone would think Canada 's Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau , 51 , was a male chauvinist or something , to listen to Helen Gurley Brown , 49 . Asked on a Canadian television show what she thought of Trudeau 's recent marriage to 22-year-old Margaret Sinclair , the sexpert editor ( Cosmopolitan ) and author ( Sex and the Single Girl , etc. ) used the unminced word " outrageous . " Said Mrs. Brown : " What I think your Prime Minister has done is set back the cause of a certain kind of equality for a long , long time . I think the idea that you must go and pick someone nubile who is 29 years younger than you is not any example to set for the rest of the men in the world . " <P> Back in his Harlem pulpit for the first time in four months , the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell , 62 , told the 2,500 faithful in his Easter congregation that he was retiring . It might have been more of a shock-Powell has been pastor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen nearly as low in the church as it has in politics . Not long ago , for example , he tossed his wallet onto the Communion table and offered to bet $1,000 that nobody in the congregation could prove to him that it was wrong to drink whisky or sleep with women ( no takers ) . Powell 's consistent absenteeism in favor of relaxing at his Bahamian home in Bimini also cushioned the blow . Said one church member last week : " You do n't miss what you 're not getting . " <P> The Seventh Avenue assassins who work for Women 's Wear Daily do n't care whom they cut up with their sharp pinking shears-even America 's First Fiancee , Tricia Nixon . After her picture appeared showing her , sweet and sailor-hatted , with her intended , Edward Cox , WWD 's men named Tricia ( who is 25 ) " one of the best-dressed children in America . " Then they went on to nominate her for the 1971 Goody Two-Shoes Award . " She dresses as children should , " they snickered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . Will Fiance Cox change Tricia 's fashion image ? The children 's wear industry hopes not . " <P> " I find that I like cold countries now , " said Newscaster Lowell Thomas last week as he celebrated his 79th birthday . " The heat takes it out of you . " The heat is n't all that does it . At Miami 's Crandon Park Zoo , where he was visiting Mohan , a 1,500-lb. rhinoceros that he had helped to capture , Thomas turned to talk to the keeper while feeding his rhino friend some greens . Mohan munched the greens and went right on munching until he was lunching on Thomas ' trousers . " I was lucky , " said Lowell . " If he had got hold of me a little more firmly . . .
