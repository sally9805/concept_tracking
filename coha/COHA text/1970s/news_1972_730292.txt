txt The hall was filled , the band was ready , the opening orations were under way . Gov . Reubin Askew of Florida , seated with his family in a front-row box , asked about a friend and was told that ha had been stationed outside the hall in expectation of protests or demonstrations or other trouble . " Heck , " said the softspoken Governor , " he 's a lot safer out there than we are in here , the way things are likely to go tonight . " That was the mood as the Democrats opened their quadrennial convention  --  and out in the delegations , the whips were drilling their charges for the tests that lay ahead . Blaine Whipple , chairman of the Oregon contingent , spent more than two hours " Instilling discipline . " All day long they counted the votes  --  and traded for them ? in the teeming hotels up and down Miami Beach . The Missouri caucus at the Palm Bay Club was typical . Gov . Warren E. Hearnes has labored mightily to hold his bloc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidly within the opposition to Senator George . But as a politician from another state commented , referring to the process by which an atomic chain reaction is triggered , " has reached the point of critical mass , and it it becoming harder and harder to resist . " So Mr. Hearnes 's package started to come untied . Senators Thomas F ' . Eagieton arid Stuart Symington of Missouri , both early Muskie backers , made it known that they felt they had to go with Mr. on the crucial California challenge , and it appeared that as many as 10 others might follow . It happened in a half dozen states during the day . ? Or take Ohio , a state whose 153 votes are divided between Mr. and Senator Hubert H. Humphrey . The 26 blacks , most of whom are committed to vote for Mr. Humphrey , saw a chance to bargain with Mr. . If he would support Carol McClendon , a black city councilwoman from Cleveland , for membership on the national committee , they would vote with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // the convention opened . But there was erosion elsewhere in Ohio , for the most predictable of reasons : selfinterest . Robert E. Sweeney , a stanch Humphrey backer , said he would vote to sustain Mr. 's defense of California 's winner-take-all system because he owed his seat to the winner-take-all rule governing the choice of the Ohio at-large delegation . ? Bons mots of the week ? former Senator Eugene J. McCarthy with a solution to the gnarled procedural tangle preceding the choice of a Presidential nominee : " We should elect a Vice President and let him appoint a President . " A journalist , apropos of the tedious calculations of ' what constitutes a convention majority : " This is n't the new politics , it 's the new math . " Frank Mankiewicz , Mr. 's political strategist , on his man 's decision not to attend a meeting of the candidates : " If Illinois and California are going to be Czechoslovakia , he does n't want to be at Munich . " ? The bitterness of the California controversy , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means of stopping Mr. , was never more evident than in a clandestinely circulated 50-page tract attacking the South Dakotan in savage terms . " He has repeatedly voted wrong on legislation affecting working people and the trade union movement , " said the document , which was distributed to every delegate affiliated with the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations . It also attacked his statement that he would go to Hanoi and beg , if that would speed the release of American prisoners of war . " Senator sees communism as just ' another economic system ' which some people ' want to be organized under , ' " the document said . " Presumably , the people who live under Communist regimes have freely made that choice . " ? It happens at every convention  --  the scramble for a pass , any kind of pass , that will get its holder on the floor . Tonight , John Jay Hooker Jr. , once a Democratic nominee for Governor of Tennessee , was wearing a security guard 's badge ; Sanford Weiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a cameraman , and a reporter for one large newspaper was metamorphosed into a delegate . ? Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts may not be in Miami Beach ? he is at his Cape Cod retreat and has spent most of the last few days on a cruise  --  but he is well represented . Among the corridor regulars here are Paul Kirk and James Flug , both key Washington staff members , and a whole circle of cronies , led by Tim Hanan , a New Yorker who has known Mr. Kennedy since their school days . Whether or not they are fanning the speculation that Mr. Kennedy might be available in case of a deadlock ? and they insist they are not ? one man is : Representative Wilbur D. Mills of Arkansas . One leading politician was called to the Mills suite in the Deauville Hotel yesterday and told that more than 200 delegates had secretly agreed to support Mr. Kennedy on the first ballot and that Mr. Mills , the master mind of the operation , had been " in constant touch " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A Kennedy spokesman at Hyannis , Mass. , described the tale as " preposterous . " ? Among the more poignant figures at the convention is Representative Carl Albert of Oklahoma . Four years ago , he held the gavel as convention chairman ; tonight he was seated with the Oklahoma delegation in the farthest recess of the convention hall . The other night he walked through the lobby of the Fontainebleau Hotel , bumped and unrecognized , stopping finally before a blackboard. to peruse the schedule for the next day . This morning , he took part in an ill attended press conference of the House leadership . But before the convention is over , he may have reason to think his decision not to serve as temporary chairman is a wise one . It is not a job that will earn many thanks . ? Finally , a new Dick Tuck story . Mr. Tuck , you may recall , is the prankster who put a leggy spy iu a trench coat aboard the Goldwater campaign train in 1964 , and who rigged an anti-Nixon sign , written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Chinatown during the 1962 campaign . Mr. Tuck , who has been traveling from state to state as the court jester , is running a daily convention newspaper called The Reliable Source . The first issue , however , contained a story about Mr. to which his aides objected , and they pulled out their advertising . Mr. Tuck had been selling two-page ads to the campaign for $500 . When they canceled , he sold the space for $1,500 to an anti-qzmcq#Govern group headed by Jeno Paulucci , a Chinesefood tycoon from Duluth , Minn. , who has been a leading Humphrey fund ? raiser for a decade .
