Both sides mobilize for the showdown on the treaties <P> Suddenly everyone was headed somewhere to talk about the Panama Canal treaties . With the pacts expected to be brought to a vote in the full Senate some time in March , seven members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee led by Chairman John Sparkman were in Panama last week to assess the situation there . So was the Duke himself , Actor John Wayne , a conservative on most issues but a supporter of the treaties ceding the canal to Panama . Meanwhile , a " Panama Canal truth squad , " including several members of Congress and a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was visiting four U.S. cities to drum up opposition to the treaties . As part of an Administration counteroffensive , Secretary of State Cyrus Vance made a three-day swing through the South and West before shuttling off to the Middle East . This week Defense Secretary Harold Brown will hit the road for a three-state speaking tour . <P> The White House is mobilizing not a moment too soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration let slide the all-important job of building support for them . Belatedly , the President began dispatching senior Cabinet members around the country to try to change minds . Carter is moving into overdrive as well . Last week he answered questions on the treaties via direct telephone hookups to Foreign Policy Association-sponsored meetings in Albuquerque and in Hattiesburg , Miss . He also sent letters to 3,000 American leaders in business and the professions , encouraging them to " help us lay the facts before the public . " <P> The airborne truth squad got off to a false start . Stops in Nashville and Atlanta were scratched because of Hubert Humphrey 's death . A storm that dumped 13 inches of snow on Cincinnati forced bypassing that city too . The first stop in the truncated , four-city " citizens ' briefing " was Miami , where shoddy advance work produced a turnout of 250 people , including a number of Legionnaires and members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in full uniform . Most of those in the audience were elderly , conservative and already dead set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Louis for a larger antitreaty crowd of 360 people and a dose of ripsnorting right-wing rhetoric . Said Georgia Congressman Larry McDonald : " This treaty is backed by the unholy alliance of Big Government , Big Business and Big Labor . " <P> The squad took on a bit of glamour in Denver with the arrival of Ronald Reagan , who made the canal a major issue in his 1976 presidential campaign . Once again , the crowd needed little convincing , and Reagan derided claims that opposition to the treaties was faltering , calling them " hogwash . " The crew then headed for its last stop , Portland , Ore .
