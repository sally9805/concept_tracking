AS the war finally came to an end last week with two coldly formal signing sessions in the silk-walled , gilt-mirrored conference room of the former Majestic Hotel in Paris , the South Vietnamese government and its Viet Cong enemies still refused even to sign the same piece of paper . <P> In the oddly muted ceremonies , there were only a few sedate waves at the clicking cameras , no speeches , no spoken exchanges of any kind between the dignitaries . None of the key figures of the settlement-neither President Nixon nor Henry Kissinger , neither Hanoi 's Premier Pham Van Dong nor Saigon 's President Nguyen Van Thieu-was even present . The three Vietnamese parties were represented by their little-known Foreign Ministers , and the U.S. by its almost forgotten Secretary of State , William Rogers , who ended up signing his name on various sheets of paper 72 times with a battery of 20 pens . As an ingenious solution to the various sensitivities , Washington and Saigon representatives signed a four-party agreement in the morning on one page , Hanoi and the Viet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hanoi signed a two-party accord in the afternoon . Figuring out that process , sighed Kissinger , " has aged us all by several years . " <P> The high-pressure last-minute drive to finish the accord was carried out on two levels . Working furiously through the weekend in Paris , a technical team headed by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State William Sullivan held marathon sessions with a similar Hanoi group . Still at issue as Kissinger flew back to Paris for a final top-level meeting with Hanoi 's Le Due Tho were a few technical questions , such as turning P.O.W.s over to the U.S. officials . <P> When Kissinger and Tho met on Tuesday ( their 24th round of talks in 3 years ) , the atmosphere was surprisingly amiable , and instead of the anticipated two days of hard bargaining , final agreement came in just four hours . Photographers were called in to record the initialing of a completed pact by Tho and Kissinger , although this fact was not disclosed . The historic announcement was left to simultaneous broadcasts in Washington , Saigon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV to claim that he had finally won all the terms needed to achieve what he had sought for four years : " Peace with honor . " A major result : " The people of South Viet Nam have been guaranteed the right to determine their own future without outside interference . " The agreement , he said , had " the full support " of Thieu , and he pledged that the U.S. still recognized Thieu 's regime as " the sole legitimate government of South Viet Nam . " He praised the 2,500,000 Americans who had fought in the war for taking part " in one of the most selfless enterprises in the history of nations . " <P> The treaty is divided into nine " chapters " covering the same topics as the nine-point proposals upon which both sides had originally agreed in October . They are : <P> 1 . All parties respect the independence , sovereignty and unity of Viet Nam as recognized by the 1954 Geneva agreements .                @ @ @ @ @
