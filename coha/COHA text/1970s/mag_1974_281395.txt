Geraldo Rivera thinks big . " I went into news knowing I wanted to be more than a local newsman standing in front of a burning building talking about the number of firemen being treated for smoke inhalation , " he says . Thirty-year-old Rivera has now been in the news business exactly three years and eight months as a reporter for New York City 's WABC Eyewitness News . During that time , the former Brooklyn street-gang leader , merchant seaman , dry-goods salesman and poverty lawyer has won five Emmys , 74 other awards , and a $100,000-a-year salary . He has just started his own network show , Good-Night , America , a 90-minute magazine-format mixture of filmed reportage and talk-show discussion that premiered last month as part of ABC 's late-night Wide World of Entertainment . <P> Rivera has accomplished his celebrity with a combination of aggressive investigative reporting , cocky flamboyance , bulldozer ambition and the preemptive coverage of his own convictions . Like television news itself , the Rivera style is half journalism and half show business . Long-haired , casually hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heraldo ) Rivera is sometimes identified as the first " rock-'n ' - roll newsman . " <P> Fury and Tears . Although he had no journalistic experience , his breezy enthusiasm impressed WABC executives looking for someone to fill a vacant ethnic slot ( he is half Puerto Rican , half Jewish ) . Rivera wasted little time on one-alarm fire assignments before digging into his own niche as the station 's " slum-dope reporter . " He made his name with a three-part report on the Drug Crisis in East Harlem , which gave names and faces to drug-abuse statistics with portraits of three heroin addicts . In 1972 he sneaked a camera crew into the Willowbrook State School for the mentally retarded and produced a searing expose of the squalor in which retarded children were left unclothed and unattended . With no attempt at " objectivity , " Rivera laid the blame for Willowbrook directly on the administration of Governor Nelson Rockefeller in his commentary filled with fury and even tears : " This is what it looked like . This is what it sounded like . But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It smelled of filth , it smelled of disease , and it smelled of death . " <P> Reports like these have earned Rivera the reputation of a crusader . They have also brought him unusual freedom . He and Cameraman Martin Berman have separate headquarters away from newsroom hustle in a cluttered basement office known as " Geraldo 's Bodega . " Rivera simply notifies the station when he has a report ready for broadcast . " Reporters are paid for each appearance on the air , " says Rivera . " It is the greatest single cause of TV news mediocrity . It fosters quantity rather than quality . " <P> Rivera 's favored status and his independence have hardly made him popular among his colleagues . Some resent his leapfrogging past others with more experience . Others point to his aggressive tactics . Last fall , for instance , Rivera decided to cover the Israeli war . When the station 's decision was to send no one , Rivera dashed over the station director 's head to the network and wangled an O.K. Says one WABC executive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he wants , and then plays them off against one another . "
