Beware the Brothers <P> Sir : Presuming in good American fashion that the accused are innocent until proved guilty , my reaction to news stories on a plot to kidnap Henry Kissinger Jan. 25 and to blow up the heating systems of federal buildings is that the church is alive and well in jail in the persons of the Berrigan brothers and their " co-conspirators . " <P> I thrill to the new pattern these people are shaping , the life-style they are by example inviting others to share at no little cost to themselves . And I note the liveliness of spirit and the joy that sustain them in their trouble . <P> It is a great and perilous way they have entered upon , offering in deed and word an authentic Christian humanism as alternative to what they consider a cannibalizing society eating its young and destroying the physical habitat it lives on . The Government better be wary . These are lovely people , real hard-nosed good guys . They lay their lives on the line . <P> MATTHEW J. GUERIN West Islip , N.Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a very great extent inconsequential . Had Christ 's prophetic role and salvation mission been dependent upon Pilate 's decision , it is not too likely that Christ would have attained even the notoriety of Superstar . Perhaps what Daniel and Philip Berrigan have said to all is that the genuine role of the prophet lies in his assumption of a powerless position in the face of the world 's total rejection . <P> JOHN D. COX South Bend , Ind . <P> <P> Sir : TIME 'S story , concentrating on the Berrigans , obscures the main issue : the law of conspiracy is so broad and vague , the snooping powers of the FBI and the Department of Justice so pervasive and unregulated , that the fundamental right of dissent is in jeopardy . What will be on trial will not be , as TIME concludes , " the facts of the case and ultimately their the Berrigans ' integrity . " At issue will be the right of men to speak out against injustice without being subject to intimidation and persecution . <P> ( MRS . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the clerical conspiracy may yet happily produce another national holiday . After all , America has no equivalent to Guy Fawkes Day , commemorating an unsuccessful plot in 1605 to blow up the English Houses of Parliament . <P> Think of the reassuring ceremonies , conducted by J. Edgar himself , as the heating tunnels in the Capitol are examined and declared free of explosives and/or conspirators . <P> Ancillary boosts to the economy would include sales of fireworks , along with benefits to the motel and recreation industries . <P> CARLTON W. DUKES Trumbull , Conn . <P> <P> Spawning the Macabre <P> Sir : Thank God for your cover story , " The Shame of the Prisons " Jan. 18 . This could be the breakthrough that many of us who work in correction have been waiting for through years of discouragement and frustration .
