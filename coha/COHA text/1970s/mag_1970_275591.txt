Halfway down Fleet Street , London 's Newspaper Row , stands an oasis named El Vino . There , over vintage wines and aged whisky , reporters and editors swap the stories that tough British libel laws discourage them from printing . One of the most durable topics over the past few years has been the flamboyant personality and liberal accounting methods of Captain Robert Maxwell , 46 , who built tiny Pergamon Press into a major scientific publishing house . Among financial editors there was a common conviction that the Czech-born publisher , who won a military cross while fighting with the British in World War II , was an expert in complex corporate maneuvers . <P> Maxwell , a Member of Parliament until he was defeated in the June election , was held in considerably greater esteem in London 's financial community . Last year , advised by merchant bankers N.M . Rothschild &; Sons , Saul Steinberg , 31 , chairman of Manhattan 's Leasco Data Processing Equipment Corp. , made a $60 million bid for control of Pergamon . The ebullient Steinberg saw Pergamon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Leasco ( 1969 sales : $101 million ) , which has aggressively moved into all phases of computer information services as well as management consulting and insurance . <P> The two entrepreneurs started negotiations last summer with a display of toothy smiles . But as Steinberg pressed for more financial information and disliked what he learned , the smiles turned to snarls . The resulting battle has become one of the longest , most acid and most entertaining in British business history . Steinberg 's charges and Maxwell 's countercharges have frequently enlivened prime-time television . Even the Board of Trade , Britain 's overseer of commercial practices , is investigating the controversy . <P> Tumultuous Meeting . Steinberg halted his takeover effort a year ago , but not before Leasco had spent some $22 million to buy 38% of Pergamon 's stock in the open market . Last October a tumultuous stockholders ' meeting voted Maxwell off the board and out of the chairmanship . Next month Leasco filed a suit charging Maxwell and his associates with conspiring to make false statements about Pergamon 's earnings and financial condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the suit is a " ploy , " and is suing Leasco , alleging conspiracy to defraud . <P> At the heart of the dispute are Pergamon 's profits . Under the accounting formula used by Maxwell , Pergamon had 1968 pretax profits of $5.04 million . But a special audit by Price Waterhouse , published two weeks ago , placed 1968 profits at only $1.2 million and Pergamon 's year-end assets at $10.8 million rather than the $16.9 million originally reported .
