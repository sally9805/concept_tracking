At times on November 26 and 27 , listening to the testi ? mony in federal Judge John J. Sirica 's courtroom in Washington , I had a feeling that all of us there were sitting in at the death of the Nixon presidency . It was impossible to suppose at these times that Mr. Nixon could remain long in office or even want to if the of ? fenses suggested by the circumstances that had led to this hearing and made all too believable by some of the testimony had in fact been committed in his behalf . For the circumstances were such that if the offenses had been committed at all , they would surely be judged in the public mind and very possibly be judged at crim ? inal trials in this or other courts and by Congress in impeachment proceedings to have been committed in effect by the President himself . The suggested and suspected offenses were pe.rjury , obstruction of justice and , specifically , the deliberate obliteration of a portion of a White House tape record ? ing . The tape recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watergate break-in , between the President and H. R. Haldeman , who was then and until last April 30 Mr. Nixon 's staff chief . The obliteration of 18 minutes and 15 seconds of this tape was admitted by the President 's lawyers . The fact that the obliterated portion had recorded a discussion of the Watergate affair was also admitted . The questions in dispute and examination before Judge Sirica were whether the erasure of the obliterated portion was deliberate or accidental and whether the President 's personal sec ? retary , Rose Mary Woods , lied under oath in this court ? room on November 8 and was lying again at this hearing . Her role was enough to identify any offense that may have been committed in connection with the June 20 tape closely and personally with the President . Rose Mary Woods is a sort of Nixon institution . She has been the President 's secretary since 1951 . He gave her the rank of executive assistant to the President last June 12 . It has been said of quite a few people around the President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resigned with Haldeman on April 30 because of association with the Watergate scandals , that they would never have done anything in their official capacities that they did n't know or be ? lieve the President wanted them to do . This may be said more truly and certainly of Rose Mary Woods than of anyone else in the President 's past or present ploy . If she lied , he lied . If she tampered with the June 20 tape or any other Watergate tape , he did . One must add , " in effect . " It 's a pro forma addition , for the record only . The central questions at issue before Judge Sirica on November 8 and afterward were questions of presi ? dential guilt or innocence . But , in this situation as inall of the other Watergate situations , a question of competence was also at issue . As these reports have previously noted , one of Mr. Nixon 's difficulties is that his claims of innocence can be credited only if extreme and pervasive incompetence at the Nixon White House is assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more thor ? oughly than the story of the erasure of the June 20 tape . Here is the essence of the story as the President , hi , attorneys and Rose Mary Woods tell it . Mr. Nixon said in a statement on November 12 that he concluded in " late September " that he should turn over " the full substance " of White House recordings of 10 of his conversations to the Senate Watergate committee and to Judge Sirica for a federal grand jury . The President 's declared intention until late September to withhold all of the White House tapes from outside scrutiny could have explained , at least in part , the glaring carelessness and stupidity with which the tapes were handled both before and after their exist ? ence was revealed in July . That excuse vanished when Mr. Nixon decided to allow some disclosure . Every ? thing that has happened in connection with the tapes since September must be evaluated on the assumption that the President is telling the truth when he says he has known since then that the substance if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? come known . One of the first things that happened was that recordings of three of the 10 conversations could not be found . At least five months had passed since the President developed enough concern about the tapes to have some of them reviewed for him and four months had passed since he listened to a batch of them . A frantic search turned up one of the missing three recordings . Its discovery contributed to a hope that the other two might also be found and ? ' so I was told at the time ? accounted for the fact that the search was not abandoned until October 27 . This bit about finding one of three recordings and consequently prolonging the search for the other two seemed to me to be pretty convincing . Although it might have helped to dispel the doubts and shock that inevitably arose when Judge Sirica and the public were told in early November that two of the 10 conversations were never recorded , it was not exploited or even men ? tioned by the President 's spokesmen . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time . ' The June 20 tape was among eight recordings that were given to Rose Mary Woods for transcription and summary , in preparation for any degree of disclosure the President finally decided upon . A subpoena issued by former Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox on July 23 and a supporting memorandum filed with the US Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia on ' Au ? gust 13 make it clear beyond question , to any moder ? ately perceptive reader of both documents , that the entire recording of the President 's meetings on June 20 with John Ehrlichman and Bob Haldeman was called for . The language of the documents is imprecise and the subpoena refers to one meeting instead of the two successive meetings , first with Ehrlichman and then with Haldeman , that actually occurred . But the intent is unmistakable . Yet J. Fred Buzhardt , a White House lawyer who has been handling Watergate and tape problems for the President since last May , indi ? cated in a written report to Judge Sirica and testified explicitly that he thought until November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subse ? quent court orders called only for the Ehrlichman portion of the June 20 tape . Buzhardt said he did n't get around to serious study of the August 13 memo ? randum , which should have corrected any doubt raised by the subpoena , until November 14 and realized only then that both the Ehrlichman and Haldeman portions of the tape were subpoenaed . An interesting thing about this assertion of abysmal neglect and error is that it was essential to the story that Rose Mary Woods told under oath on November 26-27 . Her hope of escaping indictment for perjury rested importantly on her and Buzhardt 's contention that on November 8 , when she testified in support of the President 's story that two subpoenaed recordings could not be produced because they had never existed , the understanding at the White House was that the Haldeman segment of the June 20 tape had not been subpoenaed . The same contention has to be believed if the White House story of the President 's indiffer ? ence to the obliteration of part of the Haldeman por ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Miss Woods told him on October 1 that she had accidentally blanked out four to five minutes of the Haldeman segment and that he told her not to worry about it because that part of the tape was not subpoenaed . On November 20 , five days after he is said to have been told by Buzhardt that the erasure was much more extensive than had first been supposed and also that it occurred in a subpoenaed part of the tape , Mr. Nixon did n't think the impending disclosure worth mentioning to a group of Republican governors in Memphis . He told them that he did n't expect any more Watergate shocks . The erasure was reported to Judge Sirica and announced the next day . There were significant differences between the stories that Miss Woods and Buzhardt told Judge Sirica and between the stories that Buzhardt told the judge in two written statements and then in testi ? mony . Miss Woods refused to admit that she 'd erased anything . She stuck throughout to her story that she 'd accidentally and simultaneously pushed down the " record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 1 and kept the tape running on " record " with a foot pedal while she answered a telephone call that she thought must have continued for between four and five minutes . She acknowledged that this " caused a gap " and imposed a high-frequency hum on something like five minutes of the tape . She said she had n't listened to the portion with the gap and therefore did n't know that there had been any con ? versation on it to be erased . Eighteen minutes and 15 seconds of the tape actually had the hum and no audible words on it . This segment was preceded and followed by audible conversation between Haldeman and the President , including Haldeman 's remark that he wondered whether anybody read The New Republic . All of the other remarks played back in court were about as inane as this one . Miss Woods said again and again that she could not have blanked out 18 minutes of the tape , a claim that perhaps improved her shaky position but did n't improve the White House posi ? tion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more from Miss Woods , was less interested in the difference between maybe five and 18 minutes of wordless hum than he was in Miss Woods ' failure to mention what she now called " a terrible mistake " when she testified on November 8 . He asked her why she had n't mentioned it and instead had sworn that she had n't altered any tapes in any way . She answered that she thought on November 8 that only the subpoenaed tapes were being discussed and she had the President 's assurance at that time that the Haldeman portion was n't subpoenaed . Buzhardt said in a statement on November 21 that White House lawyers had n't found out what caused the hum . He said in a report to Judge Sirica on No ? vember 26 that it " was caused by the depression of a record button during the process of reviewing the tape , possibly while the recorder was in the proximity of an electric typewriter and a high intensity lamp . " An IBM electric typewriter and a high intensity lamp were on Miss Woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she says she made her " terrible mistake . " She was n't mentioned in the November 26 report to the judge , but the effect of it was to say that she had in fact caused the entire 18-minute hum and blank-out . Buzhardt and Leonaid Garment , the acting White House counsel , were considerably more ex ? plicit when they reported the matter first to the new special prosecutor , Leon Jaworski , and then to Judge Sirica in private on November 21 . They told Jaworski and Sirica that Miss Woods had done it ; that they were not certain whether it was done accidentally or on purpose ; that , on the basis of tests so far conducted , it was hard to see how it could have been done acci ? dentally ; and that , in the circumstances , she would have to be represented by her own lawyer rather than by White House attorneys when she was called to testify . With obvious but controlled resentment , Miss Woods said during her testimony that General Alex ? ander Haig , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening of the 21st that she 'd have to retain a lawyer of her own . She said Haig called Charles Rhyne , a distinguished Washington attorney and long-time friend of the President , and arranged for him to represent her . She indicated but did n't quite say that her friend and employer of 22 years , the President , avoided any contact and discussion with her at this stage . A rather odd facet of the White House posture , as distinct from that of Rose Mary Woods , was that the President 's staff attorneys did n't know when they first reported to Judge Sirica , and did n't mention in court when they came to know , that an 18-minute erasure on the transcriber used by Miss Woods could . very easily have occurred by accident . A professional electronics ? man with knowledge of that particular machine told me that it could have happened , and if it did would have produced the exact hum that was heard in court , if Miss Woods had touched the fast rewind control on her foot pedal for just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Woods said , rather indignantly , that she did n't make that mistake . But the supposition that she did is much more plausible than her story and Buzhardt 's story that the recorder 's proximity to her typewriter and tensor lamp could have caused the hum . My man said that the typewriter motor or the lamp might have caused a hum , but not that kind of high and rasping hum . There were two separate White House tests with the transcriber beside the typewriter and lamp . One of the tests produced a hum . One did not . . ? Leon Jaworski , Archibald Cox 's replacement as special Watergate prosecutor , has within the past weeks sent four letters to the White House requesting additional notes , memoranda and tapes of key presidential con ? versations . Athong the items he requested is the record ? ing of the President 's April 19 , 1971 telephone conver ? sation with then Attorney General Richard Kleindienst ? a call during which the President told the attorney general in curt language to drop plans for a govern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ITT merger cases . It could be an important piece of evi ? dence in the special prosecutor 's inquiry into whether perjury was committed before the Senate Judiciary Committee during its 1972 hearings on Kleindienst 's nomination . It also could be relevant to the inquiry into whether ITT 's promised contribution of $400,000 to the Republican Party 's convention was in any way tied to resolving its antitrust difficulties . The White House is studying whether to turn the April 19 telephone call tape over to Mr. Jaworski , or whether to invoke executive privilege . According to White House sources , the President 's counsel already is preparing to give the special prosecutor three other requested taped coversations ? April 16 , 1973 between the President and John Dean ; April 18 , 1973 between the President and Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen when the President offered to play a " tape " of the now missing April 15 , 1973 talk with John Dean ; and June 4 , 1973 , the tape of President Nixon receiv ? ing and playing 12 hours of tapes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a particular irony to these Jaworski requests and the apparent White House compliance . Less than two months ago Cox was fired for refusing to agree to drop all further requests for presidential papers or tapes . In the negotiations leading up to his dismissal , Cox specifically cited the Nixon-Kleindienst phone call as the type of tape he would need in the future . Three days before Cox was fired , former Attorney Gen ? eral Elliot Richardson told White House presidential counsel J. Fred Buzhardt that Cox wanted to be free to request that tape . Buzhardt reportedly said flatly that the special prosecutor would have no right to it . Although Cox is gone , Jaworski appears to be build ? ing his investigation on the foundation Cox laid . Thus to see where that operation is headed , one has to review where the Watergate special prosecution force stood when Cox was fired and Richardson quit . Both men appeared last month before the Senate Judiciary Com ? mittee and their testimony , along with other material , permits a good look at the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Beginning in the last weeks of May , Cox took almost two months to put together his staff of between 40 and
