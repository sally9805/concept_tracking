WORK-A-HOLICS LIVE LONGER . by Frederic A. Birmingham One of the oft-repeated cliches of the last generation in journalism was the interview with thelocal centenarian . More often than not , the interviewee answered the question as to what caused his longevity by gleefully stating that he drank a little whiskey , ate what he pleased , worked 16 hours a day , and was very fond of girls . While no one could ever blame the oldster for enjoying having outlived his peers , we never believed his lifestyle was contributing to his longevity  --  until recently , that is . Now we are being told by gerentologists that a little whiskey is good for you , that exercise and physical labor prevent coronaries , and that those of us with active sex lives live longer . Full-fledged activity into the later years is a recognizable means of keeping the brain active , the body responsive , and the nuts and bolts workingnormally , rather than rusting away in sluggish retirement or do-nothingness . We meet here many successful individuals who have proved the point . Granted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were kept flowing and valuable by usage . In some cases , they worked right up to the end . In others , they are still at it and , bless their hearts , will continue on this sensible and rewarding course . The glorious assemblage of men and women celebrated here is glowing proof of how work not only lengthens the life span butgives it meaning and satisfaction during years when every hour of purpose and satisfaction makes living sweeter than ever before . Our own Norman Rockwell , working into his mid-80 's and endeavoring to put brush to canvas on a regular schedule while his life forces permitted , was an inspiration to all . He is said to have stopped working only on Christmas morning , and the phenomenal number of paintings that he finished is living proof of his long hours with his paint brushes . He clambered all over the landscape of New England and even around the world looking for perfect props and models . He habitually modeled the exact mood he wanted to achieve . He was an actor , painter , producer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved tennis so much he put in his own court so that he could play with his sons . He traveled. .. he worked . .. he kept active .. . and he loved his work . The key ! It 's fascinating that one of the portraits Norman so enjoyed doing is the one shown with this article , a handsome likeness of a cousin , Colonel Willard F. Rockwell , who journeyed to Norman 's Stockbridge studio in 1966 to pose for it . A geneologist at heart , Colonel Rockwell checked his ancestry and , along with having discovered the family crest and such from England , he ascertained that two Rockwell brothers came to this country together : one founding the branch of the family that ineluded Norman 's ancestors , the other , founding his own . It was a meeting of giants of an utterly differing cast , except that they shared a huge zest for living and accomplishment . The Colonel , described by President Eisenhower as " one of America 's foremost industrialists and innovators in industrial technology , " was the honorary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except Sundays in the executive offices until his " sudden " demise at the age of 90 , only this past year . A Rockwell tribal member to the core . The dynamics of the arts seem to stir the life juices just as mightily as industrial challenge . Marc Chagall , at 92 , recognized as one of the world 's greatest painters , whose vibrant canvases pulse with life and color ( and sell at five-figure prices ) works constantly . " To paint , you have to be possessed , " he has said . He seems possessed of the vitality that often accompanies genius . That same vitality animates the remarkable Artur Rubinstein . Now 93 , he recently gave a nationally televised keyboard recital at the White House : His fortissimo was the thunder of youth , his pianissimo as delicate as a flower , his smile cherubic . His companion of the muse , 89-year-old Maestro Arthur Fiedler , vigorously wielding his baton for the Boston Pops Orchestra , brushes aside compliments on his obvious fitness . " I wave my arms all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise . " That grand lady , Dr. Margaret Mead , famed American anthropologist , received in 1970 the Senior Citizen Award from the Isabella Geriatric Center , because she personified at that time how people over 65 can continue to lead useful and productive lives . She admitted to the sin of greed ? " Greed for new experiences . " Wide awake in a sleeping world , she continued her great task of " new directions for the human race " until her death in 1978 at 77 years , concealing until the last of her active days her private knowledge of the cancer which ultimately overcame body , but never spirit . Sister under the skin to Dr. Mead was the fabulous Grandma Moses . Painting was only an avocation with her until her work was first recognized in 1938 ? her " career " began when she was 77 ! After that she became world famous , both for her work and her happy addiction to it . To say that she flourished is an under-statement . When she died in 1961 , aged 100 , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good prices . Lowell Thomas , who for decades has recounted the wonders of the world and the adventures of its celebrities , is a wonder himself . He lectures , he travels , he broadcasts , he explores , he skis ... at 85 . In 1977 , a widower , he married again and enjoyed what he called " probably the longest and most unusual honeymoon in history " ? it lasted nine months and spanned 70,000 miles . A pilot in World War I , he enjoyed the couple 's return to the U.S. on the fasterthan-sound Concorde . British sculptor Henry Moore seems to be cast in the heroic mold of one of his classic statues . At 81 , he is the acknowledged master of monumental sculpture . He 's been working since 1928 and survives as a living monument to the creative force and his daily dedication to a demanding art . The irrepressible Maurice Chevalier , probably the best spokesman France ever had since the Marquis de La-Fayette , sang and danced his way into his 80 's and for people all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits . The gray hair and the wrinkles were inescapable , but the lilting voice and the roguish eyes never lost the charm which had made him the perennial star of the Folies Berg  --  re and took Hollywood immediately by storm the minute he turned up to star in those silly musicals about nothing which still seemed to be better for the soul than all the dray-ma on Broadway . There was an unforgettable moment years later when Chevalier arrived in the U.S. on what was to be his last tour . A beautiful young thing , inspired by her role of intrepid reporter , stuck a microphone into his face on a national hookup and breathlessly asked what might be charitably called an inappropriate question . " Mr. Chevalier , having so much life behind you now , how do you feel about life , in , er , old age ? " Having said it , she was embarassed and wished she had n't , but there it was . Chevalier always admired female beauty , and perhaps that is why he gallantly and tenderly fielded what could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With that paternal look he could wear so well in the presence of a young girl ( there was still a sexy edge there to keep her slightly on guard , just the same ) , he flashed the famous broad , devilish Chevalier smile , and said : " Life is merveilleuse when you consider the alternatives . " There is philosophy enough for a thousand lifetimes . Another world figure of extraordinary vigor and accomplishment in his later years is Albert Szent-Gyorgyi , M.D. , now 86 , one of the world 's most honored scientists . He won the Nobel prize in 1937 for the discovery of ascorbic acid , Vitamin C , and for his studies on cellular respiration . In 1954 he received the Albert Lasker Award , and his most recent research has been on the deadly mystery of cancer . The doctor credits his healthy oid age to a love of his work , research , and the fight against cancer , which gives him a strong opponent . It has made him , he says , " a happy man . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her 20 's . That giant of our time , Dr. Albert Schweitzer , personifies the invigorating powers of accomplishment dedicated to others . We think of him as a Christ-like figure , a missionary doctor in Africa fighting leprosy , sleeping sickness , and a host of other tropical diseases on their own grounds . We know the rigors of his life in the equatorial jungle , and his struggle to build a hospital almost single-handed . But to finance this , he also had to give organ recitals ( his skills at the console were internationally recognized ) , lecture and preach throughout Europe , and simultaneously manage to write the definitive work on the music of Bach . His many-sided genius was driven by an astonishing capacity for arduous physical and mental labor , but underlying it all was an artist striving with humility to be a true disciple of Christ . By the time of his death at the age of 90 in 1965 , he had succeeded perhaps more than he was aware . He personified the saintliness to be found in human endeavor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the foregoing . We wish we could give you an endless list of the heroes and heroines of noteworthy courage and pure pizazz in their later years , but among the hundreds reviewed for this article , some few are too irresistibly appealing to pass by . Let us consider , with a bow of respect and a smile of genuine admiration , the following : ? 74-year-old Eric DeReynier , who somewhat resembles Lloyd Bridges , is a hang glider enthusiast on the dangerous and taxing cliffs south of San Francisco . ? Princess Alice of Great Britain , Queen Victoria 's only surviving grandchild , is 95 and has the record for carrying out more than 20,000 public engagements . ? Inventor Dr. Robert D. Reed of Tulsa , Oklahoma , 73 , would " rather perish than retire . " He is holder or coholder of 345 U.S. and other patents . " Invention is the product of an active mind and unquenchable optimism , " he says . ? Arthur Loeb Mayer , of **25;4083;TOOLONG , is 92 and spends nine months of the year on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Southern California , Stanford , and Dartmouth , among others . After 70 years , he has something important to say about the history , art , and economics of the motion picture industry . ? Last year Robert Penn Warren , at 73 , published another two books . ? Laura Benet , 94 , has just published a memoir entitled When William Rose , Stephen Vincent &; I Were Young . She is the author of nine biographies and six books of poetry . " My poetry comes slowly . It trickles like a spring . " ? And , of course , we would not want to overlook Pearl Taylor . She is taking lawfor-laymen courses at Long Beach City College in California , and at 90 years she is the oldest coed . But she is a charmer . She was recently crowned queen of the Mardi Gras at the college . She 's going to continue with her classes but says , " I 'm perfectly willing to give up my crown and give the younger girls a chance . " The whole situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiger " of World War I fame , Premier Georges Clemenceau . His formula for how to stay young at 80 : " Go to work at five in the morning . Go to bed at eight at night . Cut trees . " What can we learn from all of these endearing , fascinating , and frequently inspiring data ? Some helpful hints , otherwise known as you-better-believe-it facts . Among the small army of candidates for mention in this article , we reviewed photographs of hundreds of persons who had achieved 80 and 90 years of life , and sometimes more . There was not an obese person among them , which calls to mind the instructive and crisp summation once laid upon me by a philosopher/physician : " There are old men and there are fat men , but there are no old , fat men . " On the spiritual and mental side , there are equally meaningful , if not so blunt , truths . You wo n't find many neurotics living to be 100 . Why ? It could well be that no one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for somebody else . All these valuable human beings we have met along the way in this visitation reached the splendor of their years while concerned not with themselves but with their fellow beings . Say it how you will : In terms of pure longevity , the more you give , the more you are apt to receive .
