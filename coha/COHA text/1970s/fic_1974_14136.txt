SCENE : An old sleazy hotel room . Semirealistic with a beat-up brass bed , cracked mirror , broken-down chairs , small desk , etc . It 's the dead of winter . A small paraffin heater provides the only heat . CODY lies spreadeagled on his back on the bed with his arms and legs handcuffed to each bedpost . He 's asleep with dark glasses on . He wears jeans and a cowboy shirt . SANTEE sits in a chair stage right of the bed reading the Racing Form . He wears a long dark overcoat , shiny black shoes and a gangster-type hat . In his lap is a Colt .45 BEAUJO is practicing his pool shots with a cue and three balls on the floor . He wears a forties-type pinstriped suit with white shoes . His clothes are very wrinkled like he 's been sleeping in them for a month . The stage should be dark or hidden before the opening . In the darkness the sound of horses galloping at a distance is heard . A slowmotion color film clip of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear wall . No screen . The film begins out of focus and slowly is pulled into a sharp picture as the sound of galloping horses grows louder . The film clip lasts for a short while with the sound then CODY wakes up with a yell . The film goes off and the lights onstage bang up . SANTEE and BEAUJO continue their routines . CODY Silky Sullivan in the seventh ! By a neck . By a short head . Silky Sullivan in the seventh ! p. 3 BEAUJO He 's got one , Santee . SANTEE ( without moving from behind his paper ) He 's lost it . I told ya ' he 's lost it . BEAUJO Sounds very certain to me . SANTEE Silky Sullivan was a fly-by-night C.V . Whitney nag outa ' Santa Anita . Won a couple a ' stakes back in sixty-two . Retired to stud shortly thereafter . Known chiefly for his dramatic closing rushes . BEAUJO I 'll be darned . He 's sure slippin ' bad ai n't he . SANTEE Slippin ' ai n't the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waking up ) I need a better situation . It 's too jagged in here . This wallpaper , the smell . You got ta take these things into consideration . BEAUJO Maybe he 's right , Santee . SANTEE Sure he 's right . I 'd be the first to agree that he 's right . But it 's his own damn fault . We was set up pretty in California were n't we . The Beverly Wilshire . Room service . The whole fandango . BEAUJO Yeah . Could n't even hear yerself walk down the halls . SANTEE So what 're we doin ' here then ? p. 4 BEAUJO Fingers . SANTEE Naw , you numbskull . It ai n't Fingers . That 's a byproduct of the situation . The reason we is here is on account of Mr. Artistic Cowboy here . Backslidin ' on his system . That 's the reason . If he was still dreamin ' the winners we 'd still be in California . In the money . Now ai n't that right . BEAUJO I suppose so . SANTEE No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us on the skids . CODY Could I have a cigarette ? SANTEE We 're runnin ' low , pal . CODY Just a puff then . SANTEE All right , give him a smoke . BEAUJO Could I have the keys . ( SANTEE reaches in his pocket and pulls out a ring of keys . He tosses them to BEAUJO . ) SANTEE Just the right arm . ( BEAUJO unlocks the handcuffs on CODY 'S right arm and gives him a cigarette then lights it . CODY smokes . ) SANTEE You got ta remember that I ai n't the source a ' this caper , Beaujo . I been askin ' Fingers for a new dreamer for months now . It ai n't my idea of a good time beatin ' a dead horse ya ' know . p. 5 BEAUJO What 's Fingers ' angle keepin ' Cody on then ? CODY ' Cause I 'm the best . He knows that . I 'm the best . SANTEE ( to CODY ) Aw shaddup ! ( to BEAUJO ) You know a big time gamblin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those memories when it was pourin ' in like a flood . A quarter of a million bucks in a day . That ai n't shootin ' chicken ya ' know . BEAUJO Yeah , but he must have other dreamers workin ' for him . He 's got ta pay the rent . SANTEE Sure he does but they 're all mediocre . No class . I 'll have to hand it to Mr. Artistic here , once upon a time he had some class . CODY I could regain my form if I got some decent treatment . SANTEE You had your shot at the red carpet routine and you blew it . CODY Nothin ' fancy . Just some free movement during the day . A chance to get my blood moving again . SANTEE A chance to escape you mean . CODY I been with it too long , Santee . I could n't run out on ya ' now . I 'd be lost . It 's been years . I been blindfolded and shuffled from one hotel to another for as long as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . The sun would probably blind me . Where would I go if I did escape ? p. 6 SANTEE Wherever you was headed last time you cut loose . CODY I do n't remember that . I musta ' been off my cake . I 'd never try it again . I promise . SANTEE No dice , Beethoven . BEAUJO Would n't hurt to just let him walk around the room here , Santee . Just to get his circulation going . SANTEE Well if it ai n't the soft-hearted gangster type . Go ahead then ! Turn him loose . I 'm gettin ' sick of his corny mug and his crucified position . Go ahead ! Just remember if he gets loose it 's your ass , not mine . BEAUJO ( as he unlocks CODY ) Sure , sure . The last time Fingers bothered with us was last Christmas when he gave us each an Indian-head nickel . We could be mistaken about this whole deal ya ' know , Santee . I mean what if Fingers has just cut out on us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SANTEE He would n't do that . BEAUJO What 's to stop him . He ai n't exactly a man of high morals or nothin ' . SANTEE Do n't start bad-mouthin ' Fingers now . Just ' cause things get tough is no reason to commit mutiny . Fingers 's been good to us right along . BEAUJO Yeah , well I would n't exactly describe our present situation as the berries . p. 7 SANTEE You got no faith . No gamblin ' heart . BEAUJO I figure it 's more like a game a ' pool . You know , the way sometimes you got the feel you got the touch . All the practice and technique in the world ca n't beat ya ' ' cause you got magic . There 's no trace a ' tension . Then it goes . Just like that . No way to pin it down . It just slides away from ya ' . I figure that 's how it is with Cody here . SANTEE Maybe . CODY Yeah . That 's how it is all right . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes the numbers blur . SANTEE ( to CODY ) You 'd agree with anything to get yerself off the hook . Come on , take a walk , Mr. Artist . It may be yer last for a while . ( CODY begins to get up from the bed . He struggles to gain muscular control , moving his limbs very slowly and trying to figure out how they work . BEAUJO backs away and lights a cigarette . SANTEE waves the pistol at CODY . ) SANTEE Just remember the old iron here . She gets very ticklish in a nervous situation . BEAUJO What if we was to make a real effort to treat him decent for a change . You know , steak and eggs in the morning , maybe a walk down the hallway , maybe even bring in a little chippie to warm his heart . p. 8 SANTEE None a ' that stuff . First thing you know he 'll be crying about his record again . That 's what got him started in his present slump if you 'll recall . CODY My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , Santee ? SANTEE What 'd I tell ya ' ? Yeah , yeah . I still got yer record . CODY Just do n't bust it or nothin ' . You would n't bust it wouldya ' ? SANTEE I 'll bust yer damn neck if ya ' do n't start walkin ' around this room pretty soon . come on , start hoofin ' . CODY I got ta take it slow . Everything 's like mush . It feels like Jell-O in my veins . SANTEE Yeah , yeah . The Champeen Complainer . ( CODY finally gets to his feet and moves very slowly around the room trying to adjust to walking . Every once in a while he loses his balance and BEAUJO helps him stay upright . ) BEAUJO I know you got somethin ' against art , Santee , but maybe he 's right ya ' know . I mean maybe his dreamin ' does take on a kind of an art form , the way he does it . It might need some special stuff to get him back in top form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent bed for one thing . p. 9 BEAUJO Yeah . I mean that 's important . A thing like that . After all , the bed is where he does his work . This thing 's like sleepin ' on a week-old griddle cake . ( Kicking the bed ) SANTEE We ca n't afford it . It 's not within the budget . CODY Some fresh air . BEAUJO Now you ca n't begrudge a man a little fresh air once in a while . SANTEE We might arrange some fresh air . Maybe . He 's got ta be blindfolded though . He ca n't know where he is . That 's the chief thing that Fingers impressed upon us . He ca n't for a second know where he is outside the room he 's locked up in . Otherwise it spoils the dreaming . He ca n't know the time either . CODY We 've come a long way from the Beverly Wilshire have n't we ? SANTEE A long way down . CODY No , I mean we 're on a whole different continent here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can you feel it , Mr. Sensitive ? CODY We took a ship . SANTEE Do n't start guessing . There 's no way you can find out . CODY You 've blocked up all the windows again . p. 10 SANTEE That ai n't so unusual . That 's standard procedure . CODY They speak English here though . They speak English do n't they ? SANTEE No guessing goddammit ! Or it 's back in the sack and no dinner ! BEAUJO Take it easy , Cody . No need to get Santee worked up . SANTEE Just keep walkin ' , meatball . CODY It 's all right . Fingers ' theory was good for the beginning but now it sucks dogs . SANTEE How 's that ? CODY He do n't understand the area I have to dream in . BEAUJO There 's nothing we can do about that now . CODY Not this area . The inside one . The space inside where the dream comes . It 's got ta be created . That 's what Fingers do n't understand . He thinks it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what 's so different now . CODY He 's blocked up my senses . Everything forces itself on the space I need . There 's too much chaos now . He 'll never get a winner out of me till the space comes back . SANTEE What a crock a ' shit . I never heard so much gobbledygook in my whole life . p. 11 CODY What do you dream about , Santee ? SANTEE I do n't dream . I 'm one a ' those rare dreamless sleepers . I got no worries , no troubles to work out . Everything 's hunky-dory . CODY I dream about the Great Plains . SANTEE Well that 's yer whole damn trouble ! That ai n't what yer gettin ' paid for . Yer paid to dream about racehorses . That 's all . BEAUJO Yeah , Cody . Shit man , you got ta get down to business . We 're goin ' down the tubes in this dump while you dream about the Great Plains . CODY It 'll get worse . SANTEE What ! It ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go on ! Back in the sack ! I ai n't gon na tolerate that kinda ' stuff ! BEAUJO Now take it easy , Santee . SANTEE Back in the sack ! I ai n't takin ' no more crap from this hick ! I ca n't stand the sight of him . Back in the sack ! ( BEAUJO leads CODY back to the bed and helps him back into the position he was in before . Then he puts the handcuffs back on him and locks them all . CODY does n't resist . ) SANTEE ( pacing around the room with his gun ) I 'm goin ' straight to the top . No more fartin ' around . Tomorrow morning I 'm gon na ' call Fingers and get the lowdown . This whole situation stinks . It 's driving me crazy . It 's useless keepin ' this creep here . He ai n't gon na ' come up with a horse . He ai n't come up with a horse for over six months . One bum dream after another . He 's lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone a winner tomorrow . I ca n't stand it . I 'm goin ' down there now and call him . Right now . You got some change Beaujo ? Gim me some change . p. 12 BEAUJO All right , all right . Take it easy though , Santee . You do n't want him comin ' down on us too hard . You might catch him in a bad mood . ( BEAUJO hands SANTEE some change for the phone . ) SANTEE I do n't care how I catch him . We just got ta get outa ' this slump somehow . I 'm just goin ' down the block to a phone booth . Do n't let this jerk loose for a second . BEAUJO You got the keys . SANTEE ( remembering he 's in a position of power ) Yeah . Right . I got the keys and do n't you forget it . I got the keys . ( SANTEE exits . BEAUJO speaks to CODY . ) BEAUJO What the hell are you tryin ' to pull ? You know better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in this together ya ' know . CODY Yeah . Sorry . BEAUJO I mean it 's mostly up to you ya ' know . I mean the dreaming end of it . You 're actually the big shot in the situation . You can call all the shots . All you got ta do is dream right . CODY It ai n't so easy , Beaujo . I 'm dried up . I need a break . BEAUJO Yeah , I can see that and I 'm doin ' everything I can to make that happen . But in the meantime you got ta play it cool . When Santee 's nerves are on edge you got ta go slow . p. 13 CODY If I could just talk to Fingers myself maybe I could convince him . I ca n't talk to Santee . He hates my guts . He do n't understand my position . It 's very delicate work , dreaming a winner . You ca n't just close your eyes and bingo ! it 's there in front of you . It takes certain special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it happen before ? It used to be a snap for you . CODY I do n't know . It was accidental . It just sort of came to me outa ' the blue . You know how that is . At first it 's all instinct . Now it 's work . BEAUJO Yeah , but you ca n't explain that kinda ' stuff to mugs like Santee and Fingers . They do n't buy it . All they understand is results . The process do n't interest them . ( BEAUJO lights a cigarette and walks around . ) CODY If I could just listen to my record again . That 's all . Just a couple of tracks off my record . BEAUJO No show . It drives Santee crazy . Beside , like he says , that 's part of what got you goin ' downhill . CODY He 's nuts . In the beginning I came up with six fifteen-to-one shots in a row . Six of ' em . And all of ' em came from the music . It 's a source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . We got ta go slow . Maybe later we can sneak the music back into it . p. 14 CODY Then tell me where we are at least . What country is this ? BEAUJO Ca n't do it , Cody . It 's strictly against the rules . CODY It 's stupid ! It 's really stupid ! I 'm dreaming American horses and we 're probably in Morocco somewhere . It do n't make sense . I got ta know where we are so 's I can adjust . I 've lost track of everything . I need some landmarks . BEAUJO Fingers says the dreams are a gift from God . It do n't matter what country you dream in . CODY Fuck Fingers ! I 'm the dreamer . I ought a ' know . BEAUJO I could describe the general area to you maybe . The neighborhood around the hotel . CODY That 'd help . Anything would help . BEAUJO It 's a city . We 're in a certain area of a city . The workers wear handkerchiefs around their heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language and swagger their manhood around . CODY That could be anywhere . BEAUJO It 's a gambling town . Racing all year round . It 's the poor people who lose . Dozens of big bookmakers for every block . A few shysters work a system . All of ' em work with high stakes . The government has hooks directly into the bookmakers . There 's protection on every level except for the bums . The police are paid off by high syndicates . For the rich it 's a sport . For the poor it 's a disease . p. 15 CODY That does n't help . It do n't put me in touch with anything . I need firm ground to stand on . BEAUJO That 's all I can give you . CODY What kind of cars do they drive ? BEAUJO No more . I overstepped my bounds already . CODY What do the cops look like ? BEAUJO That 's it , Cody . No more . CODY If I could just take a walk . You think you can talk Santee into letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CODY Oh man , I wish I was dead . BEAUJO It 'll pass . CODY I got a feeling I 'll never see daylight again . BEAUJO Now come on . Do n't go gettin ' morbid about it . This is just a slump we 're in . Fingers 'll pull us out of it . CODY Fingers is in the same boat as us . We 're like his mirror . We never see him but we 're always in touch . When he 's winning we 're in the Beverly Wilshire . When he 's losing we 're in a dump like this . BEAUJO He 's got other dreamers . As soon as things pick up he 'll move us. p. 16 CODY Why is he keepin ' me on ! I wan na go back to Wyoming and raise sheep . That 's all I wan na do . I got no more tips . I 'm from the Great Plains not the city . He 's poisoned my dreams with these cities . BEAUJO You want a sleeper ? CODY Yeah . Gim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEAUJO Oh no . Last time you had four you did n't come around for three days . We thought we lost ya ' . CODY Gim me three then . BEAUJO Two 's enough . Put you in a nice light sleep . Who knows , you might even dream a winner . CODY Just gim me the pills ! ( BEAUJO hands CODY two sleeping pills and a glass of water . CODY gobbles them down . ) BEAUJO You know your problem Cody ? You do n't accept the situation . There 's no way out . Even if you could escape you 're too weak to get very far . Even if you got very far we 'd know where to find you . You got ta give in to it , boy . CODY Yeah . Maybe you 're right . BEAUJO You got ta use some smarts . If you just relaxed into it and accepted it then everything would come to you . We might even let you have a little more freedom . No blindfolds . Walks in the park . All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I keep thinking this is temporary . How long 's it been going on anyway ? BEAUJO No time hints . Just forget about the other possibilities . This is all you got . CODY I ca n't remember how it started . BEAUJO You had a dream . CODY Yeah . I had that big dream . BEAUJO Then you got publicized . CODY Yeah . Life magazine . Then my folks started cashin ' in . My brothers . BEAUJO Then half the state of Wyoming . You were the hottest thing in the West . Then we nabbed you . CODY I was kidnapped . BEAUJO Well , not exactly . CODY I was wined and dined . Where was that ? ( Through this CODY is getting drowsy until he finally falls asleep . ) BEAUJO Hollywood Park . Aqueduct . Yonkers . CODY What happened ? BEAUJO We had to keep you secret . Too many scabbies cashin ' in . CODY I used to wake up and not know where I was . As long as I can remember . p. 18 BEAUJO It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to you ( melodramatically ) You 'll find that special area . A huge blue space . In the distance you 'll see ' em approaching the quarter-mile pole . The thunder of hooves . Whips flying . The clubhouse turn . You 'll get a sense of it again . It 'll all come back just like it used to . You 'll see . You got magic Cody . You 'll see . ( CODY falls into a deep sleep . BEAUJO gets up and walks around . He comes to a stop and looks around the room . ) BEAUJO ( to himself ) Huh , for a second there I thought I was lost . ( SANTEE enters and shuts the door behind him . He goes to the heater shivering from the cold and rubbing his arms . ) BEAUJO Did ya ' talk to Fingers ? SANTEE More or less . BEAUJO What do ya ' mean ? What 'd he say ? SANTEE He was n't there . I had to talk to Zonka . BEAUJO Zonka ? What 's he know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEAUJO What 's the scoop ? SANTEE Dogs . p. 19 BEAUJO Dogs ? SANTEE Dogs . Greyhounds . BEAUJO Greyhounds ? ! SANTEE We been relegated to the dog tracks . It 's the most humiliatin ' experience of my whole career . All on account a ' that meathead ! BEAUJO There must be some mistake . SANTEE Ai n't no mistake . It come from the top . He 's got ta start dreamin ' dogs . That 's all there is to it . BEAUJO But he do n't know a greyhound from a crocodile . This kid 's strictly a horse man . SANTEE I know , I know . It ai n't my idea . BEAUJO He ca n't suddenly change his whole style a ' dreaming like that . It might kill him . SANTEE Well he 's gon na ' have to or our ass is grass ! Wake him up . BEAUJO I just gave him two sleepers . SANTEE Wake him up ! Here , take the keys and unlock him . ( BEAUJO takes the keys and unlocks CODY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 're gon na kill him with this kind of treatment . I 'm tellin ' ya ' . SANTEE I could care less . As far as I can tell it 's him that got us into this mess and it 's him that 'll get us out . All my life I been proud a ' my position . I 've carried a certain sense of honor with me but I 'll be damned if I 'm gon na carry it to the goddamn dog track . p. 20 BEAUJO He 's out cold Santee . SANTEE Wake him up ! I do n't care how ya ' do it . I want him on his feet . I 'm gon na ' drill him with dogs till he hears ' em barkin ' in his ears . ( BEAUJO slaps CODY 'S face and tries to bring him around . ) BEAUJO It 's no good , Santee . He 's out like a light . SANTEE Great ! That 's just great . Now we 're sunk . We 're really sunk . ( BEAUJO leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are free . ) BEAUJO It might mean we 're being let off the hook , Santee . Eased-in grade . SANTEE Ca n't you understand that this is serious business . What 's a ' matter with you . Zonka told me if there 's no results within the week that Fingers is sendin ' the Doctor over here . BEAUJO The Doctor ? SANTEE Yeah . You know what that means . BEAUJO He ca n't do that . SANTEE Yeah , well that 's what 's gon na ' happen if Cowboy do n't pop up with some winners and fast . BEAUJO The Doctor ? Fingers must be crazy . He was goin ' to the pay window every day for a month and now he can turn on us like this ? p. 21 SANTEE That 's the way it falls , Beaujo . ( CODY lets out a loud voice then goes right back into sleep . ) CODY Native Dancer in the eighth ! SANTEE He 's gettin ' more and more pathetic . Native Dancer musta ' died in the fifties . BEAUJO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What good is that gon na ' do us ? We need results ! Right now . There 's only one thing we can do . ( SANTEE goes to the Racing Form and leafs through it . ) SANTEE We got ta take the gamble . We got ta try to pick some dogs ourselves and pass ' em off as his dreams . That 's the only thing . BEAUJO But we do n't even know how to read the form for greyhounds . You do n't know the first thing about it . SANTEE We can learn . Look , it says here : " Black Banjo , the young Walthamstow hopeful , has been unlucky in his last six outings . With the advantage of trap one and a slow starter to his right , Black Banjo could get to the first bend and go clear . " CODY Man o ' War by a neck ! SANTEE Can you do something about him ? p. 22 BEAUJO He 'll come around in a while . SANTEE Look , write these down . Get a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Santee . We 're takin ' quite a risk . ( BEAUJO goes to a small desk and gets a pad and pencil . He writes down what SANTEE says . ) SANTEE It 's worth a try . We might even pick us some winners . Put down : " Harringay. 7.45 , Sgt. Mick . 8.00 , Go Astray . 8.15 , Zeitung. 8.30 , Lemon Castle . 8.45 , Come Dark Night . 9.00  --  " CODY ( speaking in an even , cool voice ) Black Banjo will win the seventh race at Wimbledon by two and a half lengths on the trot . SANTEE Can you shut him up . I ca n't concentrate . BEAUJO Wait a minute ! Did you hear what he said . Black Banjo ! That 's a dog . A greyhound ! SANTEE I know . I just read it in the paper . BEAUJO He just picked him to win at Wimbledon . SANTEE So what . The power of suggestion . He musta ' heard me read it . CODY Black Banjo , a young son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the looks and speed of a top-class dog . His early speed and clever tracking has told the tale on more than one occasion . Although unlucky in most of his recent deciders he will definitely win by two and a half lengths tonight at Wimbledon . p. 23 BEAUJO Listen to that ! Where 'd he get information like that ? Look it up . See if that 's his breeding . SANTEE What 'd he say ? BEAUJO Monalee Champion . Look it up . SANTEE ( looking in the paper ) Monalee Champion . Let 's see . Yeah . What do ya ' know . Monalee Champion . How 'd he know that ? BEAUJO He 's back on , Santee ! He 's back on the winners ! We 're gon na ' be in the money again ! SANTEE You think so ? I 'd hate to risk it . BEAUJO I know it . I can feel it . He 's havin ' a breakthrough . CODY Black Banjo will break in front with Shara Dee close up at the first bend . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be thrown to the outside . From there to the wire Black Banjo will have it all his own way . Shara Dee will be closing in the final stages but will not come to terms with the winner . She will be second with another length back to Seaman 's Pride . SANTEE Go call Fingers . If Zonka answers pass on the message . Black Banjo to win , Shara Dee to place . Forecast , one and three . Tell him it 's a certainty . BEAUJO Right . p. 24 SANTEE And grab me a fifth of Scotch on the way back . I 'm gon na ' need it if we lose . BEAUJO This is it , Santee . I feel it in my bones . The slump is over . Tomorrow we 'll be sittin ' pretty ! SANTEE It ai n't happened yet . ( BEAUJO exits . SANTEE talks quietly to CODY , who remains asleep . ) SANTEE Okay Mr. Artistic . Maybe I was wrong . Maybe I was pushin ' it too hard . This better be it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in little pieces and mailed to our mommas . I know you ai n't used to workin ' under pressure but that 's how it is . It 's like a snake bitin ' its own tail . We keep infecting each other . The Doctor 's on our back . The pressure 's there . It comes from the outside . Somewhere out there . We wind up with the effects . I do n't understand how you work , Beethoven , that 's how come I got no patience . To me it 's a lot a ' mumbo jumbo . Like I said , I do n't even have no dreams . All I know is that you was right once . For a solid month you was right . You was so right that you had somebody out there eatin ' turtle soup and filet mignon three times a day . Being chauffeur-driven to the grocery store . That 's how it is . You got the genius , somebody else got the power . That 's how it always is , Beethoven . The most we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color T.V. ( CODY sits up . He talks with another voice ; slightly Irish , as though he ' sbeen inhabited by a spirit. ) p. 25 CODY The main mistake is watching the race in an emotional way . As though the dog you 've gambled on is a piece of yourself . That way you only see one-sixth of the race and miss the other five dogs . You might go a dozen races gambling on dogs you 've seen before but never watched . SANTEE Say , what is this ? Are you awake now or what ? ( CODY gets up off the bed and moves easily around the room . ) CODY You got ta take mental photographs of each dog . You got ta draw back from the race , take an indifferent attitude . Memorize forty-eight dogs a night . Do n't gamble for a week of racing . Just take photographs . SANTEE Do n't try nothin ' funny ! I still got the rod . CODY Once you 've built up an interior form you attack in a calculated way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold-blooded . Make definite decisions and stick to them . Forget the Quinellas and Duellas . They 're for suckers . Stick with 5 reverse forecasts , tenners each way on the selection . SANTEE What 's got into you . Get back over here on the bed ! CODY Keep a record of the seasonal dates of bitches . One week before they 're due in season back ' em to the hilt . Do n't be fooled by fast-improving pups but do n't be afraid to have a gamble in the middle of their form . Forget Yellow Printer sons in the Derby . They 're jinxed . Too difficult to tune them up . Look at Super Rory . Donemark Printer . Tremendous class but see how fast they blew up . p. 26 SANTEE Shaddup ! ( CODY snaps out of it back into his old self . He 's barely able to stand up . A short silence then BEAUJO bursts in the door . ) BEAUJO Fingers is comin ' ! SANTEE What ! Now ? CODY Lemme talk to him . BEAUJO After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SANTEE ( threatening CODY ) You better be right , Schmoe . CODY I got ta talk to him . BEAUJO He 's bringin ' the Doctor if he loses . SANTEE Where 's my Scotch ? ( CODY collapses on the floor . BEAUJO hands SANTEE a fifth of Scotch . SANTEE breaks it open and takes a long swig . They both stare at CODY on the floor as the lights dim and the sound of an ANNOUNCER 'S VOICE is heard over the speakers . ) ANNOUNCER 'S VOICE The hare is running at Wimbledon . Black Banjo breaks clear of Shara Dee in trap three followed closely by Stow Welcome and Seaman 's Pride . As they go into the first turn it 's Black Banjo by a length and a half . There 's some bad crowding . Stow Welcome is knocked out of it . Down the back straight it 's Black Banjo going four lengths clear from Shara Dee , followed by Seaman 's Pride . It 's Black Banjo into the third bend still well clear of Shara Dee who is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Black Banjo with Shara Dee closing very fast . It 's Shara Dee and Black Banjo ! ( The swelling sound of a huge crowd drowns out the ANNOUNCER 'S VOICE as the lights go to black. ) @x SCENE : A fancy hotel room with the furniture in the same position as in Act One . A color T.V. with a flickering image , the sound off . A record player on top of a chest of drawers . The characters all have new clothes but all in the same styles as Act One . CODY still wears his shades and speaks with a slight Irish accent . He stands center stage holding a fishing pole at arm 's length with a white rabbit skin tied to the end of the line so it just touches the floor . He turns slowly in a tight circle so that the rabbit skin drags across the floor around him . He watches a litter of imaginary greyhound pups chasing the skin . This is the method for schooling puppies to chase the mechanical hare in a circle . SANTEE sits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading the Racing Form . BEAUJO sits at a table down-left dealing a hand of five-card stud to himself and an imaginary partner across from him . In the darkness , before the action begins , the sound of dogs yapping is heard faintly and grows louder as a color film clip of greyhounds racing in slow motion is projected on the rear wall . It 's done in the same way as the film of the horses at the beginning of Act One . CODY yells at his imaginary puppies , the film goes off and the lights onstage bang up . CODY turns in a circle and talks . SANTEE and BEAUJO ignore him . CODY You got ta watch that brindle . He 's a devil . The biggest in the litter . Thinks he can get away with murder . It 's very crucial to catch them at an early age . Once they get the taste for fightin ' there 's the seed of a bad habit . It 's usually the big ones that get pushy . You do n't want to take the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'll have none of it . ( He strikes out at one of the puppies then goes on in a circle. ) p. 29 SANTEE I notice he missed the fifth at Catford yesterday . BEAUJO Seven out of eight ai n't so bad . SANTEE Just hope it 's not a bad omen . BEAUJO We 're in the pink , Santee . He 's locked into it this time . SANTEE Yeah . It gives me the creeps . Like being a nurse at a flip house . ( CODY reverses direction with the pole and keeps moving in a tight circle . ) CODY It 's important to reverse your direction once in a while . To balance out the muscles . Too much counterclockwise action makes ' em soft on the right side . You watch the Irish dogs . You 'll never see near as many dogs breaking down in Ireland as you do in England . The schooling 's different . We take more time in Ireland . More patience . SANTEE He still do n't know where he is . BEAUJO He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me he 's further away than ever . He 's off his cake , Beaujo . BEAUJO Lucky for us . SANTEE What do ya ' suppose happened to him ? BEAUJO You got me . Some kinda ' weird mental disorder . I told ya ' he was a genius . There 's a very fine line between madness and genius ya ' know . p. 30 SANTEE Yeah , yeah . Cut the baloney . He 's gone bananas and that 's all there is to it . It just happens to coincide with our needs . BEAUJO Well , leastwise Fingers is happy . That 's all that counts right now . ( A loud knock at the door . SANTEE and BEAUJO leap to their feet . CODY keeps turning in a circle and mumbling to the puppies . SANTEE has his gun out . ) SANTEE You expectin ' company ? BEAUJO Not me . Must be room service . SANTEE I did n't order nothin ' . BEAUJO Me neither . ( More loud knocking . ) SANTEE Well answer it ! Go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is it ? DOCTOR 'S VOICE Fingers ! Open up ! BEAUJO ( to SANTEE ) Oh shit , it 's Fingers ! SANTEE Well let him in . BEAUJO ( to the door ) Hold on a second ! ( BEAUJO unlocks three or four locks on the door as SANTEE grabs the fishing pole out of CODY 'S hand and hides it under the bed . He grabs CODY by the back of the neck and throws him onto the bed . BEAUJO swings the door open and FINGERS sweeps into the room with the DOCTOR behind him . FINGERS is tall , thin and rather effete wearing a bowler hat , tweed cape with matching trousers , black vest with a white carnation , thin pencil-line mustache , spats , black cane and gaudy rings on every finger including the thumbs . The DOCTOR is very fat and looks like Sydney Greenstreet . He wears all black in the style of the thirties and carries a doctor 's ominous-looking black bag. ) p. 31 FINGERS Good God man , you 'd think it was Fort Knox in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . where 's my boy ? BEAUJO Sorry , Fingers . We was takin ' precautionary measures . ( FINGERS spots CODY on the bed and moves toward him . CODY runs frantically to the other side of the room . He seems terrified of FINGERS ' every move . ) FINGERS Ah yes ! Yes , yes , yes ! I should have known he 'd have the look of eagles . Absolutely . Look at him , Doctor . Just look . Splendid . DOCTOR Hmm . So that 's him . SANTEE We been keepin ' him good , Fingers . Three squares a day . Free movement through the room . Just like you said . FINGERS Those eyes . It almost hurts to look in his face . SANTEE you ai n't kiddin ' . I was just tellin ' Beaujo how sick I was gettin'a ' his mug . ( The DOCTOR takes his coat off and throws it on the bed , then he helps FINGERS off with his cape . ) FINGERS ( to CODY ) At last we meet . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for a celebration . Order some sherry and cognac . The finest in the house . ( to CODY ) You do drink I trust ? p. 32 SANTEE He ai n't being too communicative lately , Fingers . He 's slipped into some kinda ' depression or something . ( BEAUJO rings for the WAITER . The DOCTOR sinks into a chair and watches T.V. He turns the sound up very loud . FINGERS glares at him . ) FINGERS Doctor ! I say , Doctor ! ( FINGERS crosses briskly to the T.V. and turns the sound off . The DOCTOR just stares into the screen . ) FINGERS Do you mind ? We 're trying to conduct a conversation . ( FINGERS crosses back to SANTEE . ) FINGERS Now then . Where are we ? Oh yes . Depression . Depression ? Good Lord , we ca n't have that . Let me feel his temperature . ( FINGERS moves toward CODY . CODY leaps over the bed and crashes into a wall trying to get away from him . The DOCTOR is unmoved . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers . He 's only seen me and Santee for the past year and a half now . He do n't know what to make of you . SANTEE Yeah , he should settle down in a little while . Then you can pet him . FINGERS I see . Poor chap . I dare say he does look a bit at odds with himself does n't he . Has he been sleeping well ? p. 33 SANTEE In spurts . He 'll fall dead asleep for fifteen minutes in the middle of the floor and then wham , he 'll be up and prowling the room again . FINGERS I do n't like the sound of that at all . Doctor , did you hear that ? DOCTOR I was n't listening . FINGERS Santee says the poor fellow only sleeps for fifteen minutes at a stretch and then he 's up and about . DOCTOR So what ? It 's not unusual in cases like this . People in his state can go a week without sleeping a wink . FINGERS I see . I rather thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't live long . FINGERS Then it is serious . DOCTOR Maybe , maybe not . Depends on the particular case . FINGERS Well I do wish you 'd examine the poor chap and make some sort of diagnosis . After all our livelihood hinges upon his well-being . DOCTOR Later . Right now I 'm gon na ' take in a little viewing . FINGERS Well I suppose it can wait . Now then , where 's the champagne ? ( SANTEE and BEAUJO seem surprised by FINGERS lack of authority over the DOCTOR. ) p. 34 BEAUJO I thought you said sherry . FINGERS Did I ? Ah yes , sherry . So I did . CODY Just two tablespoonsful . That 's all . Otherwise you blow ' em out . FINGERS Is he speaking to me ? SANTEE We 're never certain Fingers . It could be any of us . FINGERS I see . How long has this been going on ? BEAUJO Ever since the switchover . FINGERS Switchover ? SANTEE To greyhounds . BEAUJO You upset something very fragile , Fingers . He may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't understand . BEAUJO He 's a horse dreamer , Mr. Fingers . A horse dreamer . When you had us switch over to dogs something snapped in him . The mind is a very mysterious thing ya ' know . FINGERS Yes , I see . I had no idea . Poor devil . SANTEE He 's doin ' all right though . He 's still on the winners and everything . BEAUJO But it wo n't last for long . SANTEE Will you shut up ! p. 35 BEAUJO I 'm only trying to give ya ' fair warning so it do n't come as too much of a shock . SANTEE Beaujo 's talkin ' through his hat , Fingers . He do n't know nothin ' for certain . FINGERS It 's all my fault . I should have brought a stop to this insanity long ago . I should have known something like this would happen . SANTEE Nothing 's happened . We 've been in the money for three weeks straight now . Everything 's hunky-dory , Fingers . All we got ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slump we just give him a breather . Simple as that . ( A knock at the door . ) SANTEE That must be the waiter . You just set yourself down on the bed there and I 'll order us some drinks . You just relax , Fingers . Everything 's gon na ' be okay , Beaujo , help him onto the bed . Take his shoes off , loosen his tie . ( BEAUJO helps FINGERS to the bed . FINGERS has gone all weak and sickly now . Every time FINGERS moves , CODY moves frantically to get away from him , crashing over furniture and smashing into the walls . The DOCTOR remains indifferent , staring into the T.V. with the sound off . SANTEE opens the door and lets the WAITER in . The WAITER wears white gloves and tails . He looks a bit apprehensive about the situation. ) p. 36 WAITER Uh , you rang , sir ? SANTEE Yeah , get us a coupla ' bottles of yer best cognac and some sherry . Nothin ' but the best . Oh yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep the change . WAITER Very good sir . Thank you very much sir . SANTEE Do n't mention it . Now scram . ( He shoves the WAITER out the door and bolts it . FINGERS is lying on the bed as BEAUJO takes FINGERS ' shoes off and massages his feet . ) FINGERS I had a feeling it would end like this . I 've committed a terrible sin . SANTEE Nothing 's ended . It 's all going on right now . We 're on top . Nothing 's ended , Fingers . CODY The sickness is sweeping through the kennel ! There 's no escape ! Intestinal Catarrh is on the march ! Sprinters and stayers ! Everyone 's equal in this . FINGERS What in God 's name is he on about ? SANTEE It 's nothin ' Fingers . He 's practicin ' up for White City tonight . FINGERS Oh my God ! SANTEE I 'll have him under control in just a minute . Come here you ! ( SANTEE moves toward CODY . CODY leaps away again crashing into things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch him ! Do n't you lay a hand on him ! Enough damage has been done already . CODY ( panting like a dog ) Did n't you give me enough stick already ! At Dundalk ! Shelbourne Park ! Trucked around half of Ireland like so much hamburger . FINGERS ( to SANTEE ) Now you 've done it ! You 've pushed him too far . He 's over the edge . CODY ( to SANTEE ) I kept crying for trap one . Over and over again I asked for trap one . I could 've won from the inside ! But no , I was forced to go wide . You could n't understand why I 'd check at the third bend . Time and again I 'd check at the third bend . How stupid can you get . I was schooled on the inside hare and you put me in trap six . Trap six ! Trap six ! Trap six ! I 'm bloody tired of trap six ! SANTEE Aw fuck off , ya ' nut-case ! ( to FINGERS ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned ya ' right from the start about this country bumpkin . He 's a weirdo . Unreliable . I coulda ' found ya ' plenty a ' good dreamers from the city but no , we had to go to the middle of the goddamn Great Plains and bring back a dodo . A fruitcake . Well I 've had it . From here on it 's your ballgame . I 'm watchin ' T.V. with the Doc . ( SANTEE goes and stands behind the DOCTOR and watches T.V. ) p. 38 BEAUJO ( to FINGERS ) Maybe after White City tonight we should give him a rest , Fingers . Let him get his strength back . FINGERS ( sitting up on the edge of the bed ) There 'll be no White City tonight or any other night . I 'm setting him free . SANTEE You 're what ! You ca n't do that ! he 's still worth millions even though he is crazy . FINGERS ( getting up and moving toward the DOCTOR ) I do n't care what he 's worth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so kind as to arrange air passage for two to Wyoming . I 'm taking him back personally . ( The DOCTOR stays staring at the T.V. FINGERS moves back to BEAUJO . SANTEE follows him . ) SANTEE Fingers , wait a minute . I take back what I said before . FINGERS We must gather his personal effects together . BEAUJO All he 's got is what he 's wearing and an old beat-up record . FINGERS Very well . Get it . ( BEAUJO goes to a drawer and pulls out an old album with no cover . ) SANTEE This is a real mistake , Fingers . Why do n't we just keep him on until he starts slippin ' again . No harm in that . He 's a gold mine right now . p. 39 FINGERS Gold mine . Yes . By the way , what was the name of that town we took him from . Do you remember ? BEAUJO Somewhere in the High Mountain country . Above the Big Horns . FINGERS That 's quite a large piece of real estate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEAUJO Something like Pawnee or Cheyenne . Something like that . SANTEE Cheyenne 's in the southeast . It was north of there . BEAUJO Something like Arapahoe or Mitchell . Was it Mitchell ? FINGERS Does anyone have a map ? SANTEE Look , Fingers , just leave him to us for a while . Give him another chance . We 'll bring him around . BEAUJO Well look , we can figure it out easy enough . We left Salt Lake City on a Friday night and drove all night . We crossed the Utah state line about two in the morning . FINGERS Yes , I remember that . I remember thinking , now we 're in Wyoming , it ca n't be far now . On the map it looked to be no further than Brighton is from London . Then all the next day we drove and drove . I 'd never seen such country . Nothing as far as the eye could see . Nothing . BEAUJO We hit the Wind River Reservation about noon . We had lunch in the Silver Star . Fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 40 FINGERS Yes ! I remember that ! I remember thinking this is the West ! This is really The West ! Then we got to that town where Buffalo Bill lived . I forgot the name of it . Oh what a town ! Saloons with Winchester rifles tacked up on the walls . Real cowboys in leather chaps . Indians shuffling through the dusty streets . Buffalo Bill 's name plastered on everything . And at night . At night it was magical . Like praying . I 'd never heard such a silence as that . Nowhere on the earth . So vast and lonely . Just the brisk cold night blowing in through the hotel window . And outside , the blue peaks of the Big Horn mountains . The moon shining on their snowy caps . The prairie stretching out and out like a great ocean . I felt that God was with me then . The earth held me in its arms . ( A short pause as FINGERS reflects . ) BEAUJO That was the town . FINGERS What was . BEAUJO The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINGERS Yes ! That 's right ! What was it called ? Doctor , do you remember the name of that charming town . The one where Buffalo Bill lived . Doctor ? ( FINGERS turns to the DOCTOR who is sitting very still in a kind of trance . ) FINGERS For heaven 's sake , man , snap out of it . p. 41 SANTEE What 's eatin ' him now . ( FINGERS goes to the DOCTOR and shakes his shoulder . ) FINGERS I say . Doctor ! I asked you to go and arrange our passage to Wyoming . Doctor ! ( FINGERS shakes him again . The DOCTOR lets out a bloodcurdling yell and throws FINGERS across the room . CODY screams like a dog who 's being whipped . He whimpers in a corner . BEAUJO and SANTEE stand facing the DOCTOR , who stands center stage . FINGERS moans on the floor holding his leg in pain . The DOCTOR quickly gains control of himself . ) SANTEE Say , look , Doc , I 'm with you in this . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . DOCTOR Yes , I can see that . Fetch my bag . SANTEE What ? DOCTOR My bag ! SANTEE Yessir . You bet . I 'm with you in this . ( SANTEE gets the DOCTOR 'S bag and give it to him . ) DOCTOR And stop repeating foolish platitudes . I 've grown quite tired of all this trivia . Something drastic must take place . BEAUJO Drastic ? DOCTOR Yes , that 's right . Something rather more adventurous . You 're a man of adventure are n't you , Beaujo ? p. 42 BEAUJO Well , not exactly . I mean I been around but  --  DOCTOR You 've been around ? BEAUJO Yessir . I mean , the States , you know . I 've seen the States . DOCTOR I see . Did you discover anything of particular interest in your travels ? BEAUJO Well , you know , the usual stuff . Card games , pool halls , that kinda ' stuff . DOCTOR Then you 're a man who can recognize gifts . BEAUJO Gifts ? Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . DOCTOR What I mean very simply is that perhaps in a card game you noticed a particular player who seemed to have more luck than the others . Perhaps even yourself . Something more than luck . A gift we might say . BEAUJO Yeah . You might say that . SANTEE Say , what 's goin ' on here anyway ? DOCTOR Please be silent until you 're spoken to ! SANTEE Yessir . ( During all this the DOCTOR has placed his black bag on the bed and opened it . As he talks he handles various unseen objects in the bag . ) DOCTOR I 'm not speaking superstitiously you understand . Luck is no accident . It 's a phenomenon . Luck is a living thing . The problem of course is tracking it down . p. 43 BEAUJO Yeah , I see what you mean . DOCTOR Do you ? You see , in Cody here we had actually tracked it down . We had placed it on the map . We combed the planet for someone like him and we finally found him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough Doctor ! Enough ! DOCTOR These dreams , these visions that he has , do you suppose they are purely accident ? Mere coincidence ? BEAUJO Well , I do n't know . I could n't say for sure . Look , I 'm just a sidekick here . I do n't know anything important . DOCTOR Fair enough , but there 's no harm in investigating a few details . BEAUJO I 'd rather you talked to Santee about it . I 'm liable to get a headache and go right out on ya ' ! DOCTOR Santee has no space between his ears for anything new . I was hoping perhaps you would . FINGERS ( still on the floor ) You ca n't do this ! No one 's prepared . DOCTOR I recognized you immediately , Beaujo , as a man of adventure . BEAUJO You did ? DOCTOR Yes . A man who 's been around as you say . A man who 's looked life in the face . You have dreams , do n't you , Beaujo ? p. 44 BEAUJO Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DOCTOR What do you dream about ? BEAUJO Pool mostly . Fast cars . Money . DOCTOR Yes . Pool , fast cars and money . Probably women too ? BEAUJO Sure . DOCTOR You can see the difference between your dreams and someone like Cody 's . You can recognize that you 're worlds apart . BEAUJO I guess so . I never thought about it too much . DOCTOR Of course not . No reason to think about it . That 's my job . I 'm the doctor . You 're simply the bodyguard . SANTEE Could I say somethin ' here ? DOCTOR No ! Be quiet ! Come here and look in this bag , Beaujo . I want you to see something . FINGERS NO ! Do n't look ! Do n't look , Beaujo ! DOCTOR You are a man of adventure are n't you , Beaujo ? I was n't wrong in that was I ? BEAUJO I 'm feelin ' a little paralyzed , Doc . I do n't know what it is . I 'm afraid . DOCTOR There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be something quite extraordinary . Come have a look . p. 45 SANTEE I 'll look . DOCTOR Stay where you are ! Beaujo ? BEAUJO What 's in it ? DOCTOR Come and look . BEAUJO What if I ca n't take it . I 'm not a very strong person . DOCTOR It does n't matter . Nothing will hurt you . Just come and look in the bag . ( A moment of silence while BEAUJO decides . BEAUJO slowly crosses to the bag where the DOCTOR is and looks into it . ) FINGERS Oh God . Oh my God . BEAUJO What are they ? DOCTOR Take one in your hand . Go ahead . Nothing will happen , I promise . ( BEAUJO reaches into the bag and pulls out a small white bone the size of a large marble . He holds it in the palm of his hand . ) BEAUJO What is it ? DOCTOR A bone from the back of the neck . A dreamer 's bone . BEAUJO Human ? DOCTOR Yes . BEAUJO You mean you cut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he collects certain valuable substances from his dreams in the back of his neck . Even when he loses his touch these substances remain imbedded in these magical bones . A man in possession of enough of these bones becomes eternally linked to the dreamer 's magic . His gift lives on . p. 46 BEAUJO You mean these are from dead dreames ? DOCTOR I would n't say dead exactly . Out of their bodies perhaps but not dead . BEAUJO And they help you pick the winners ? DOCTOR Infallibly . BEAUJO Then what 's the point in having live dreamers all the time . DOCTOR Unfortunately the bones tend to fade in strength . Their power has to continually be replenished . This is where the adventure comes in . It 's a very delicate process finding the correct dreamer to restore the power . It has to be one who has experienced a certain stretch of genius . One who is beginning to fade but not to such an extent as to have lost all his magic . Like Cody here for instance . He appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . Not me , boy . Not this kid . I ai n't gettin ' cut up and put in no bag . This has gone far enough . I 've played ball with you right down the line but this is the limit . No more . DOCTOR Santee , strap him to the bed ! SANTEE With pleasure . ( SANTEE goes after CODY . There 's a mad chase around the room . FINGERS weeps and moans on the floor . The DOCTOR pulls a huge syringe out of his bag . BEAUJO is frozen. ) p. 47 DOCTOR You see the territory he travels in . He 's perfectly capable of living in several worlds at the same time . This is his genius . CODY I was just bluffin ' ! Honest ! I made it all up ! I got no magic ! I was just pretending ! DOCTOR Right now he 'll do anything to deny his gifts . His gifts are poison to him now . If he knew his power he could even make us disappear . Fortunately he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greaseball ! ( CODY keeps getting away from SANTEE ) FINGERS Stop it ! You 've got to stop it ! Beaujo , do something ! DOCTOR You see how we 're each on our own territory right now . Each of us paralyzed within certain boundaries . We 'd do anything to cross the border but we 're stuck . Quite stuck . BEAUJO You 're gon na ' operate on him ? DOCTOR I 'm simply going to alter the balance of things . Like a great chef . A pinch of this with a pinch of that . You 'd be amazed at how little it takes to create an explosion . Santee , put him on the bed . ( SANTEE has CODY in a firm grip . CODY squeals and squirms but SANTEE is too strong . He hauls CODY over to the bed and throws him down on his back then straddles his stomach and holds his arms down. ) p. 48 BEAUJO Maybe there 's some other way . I mean maybe we could hypnotize him or something . I keep putting myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You see there 's no way for you to be in his place . There 's no way for any of us to be in any place but the one we 're in right now . Each of us . Quite separate from each other and yet connected . It 's quite extraordinary is n't it ? Now hold him down Santee . It 's important to get a direct hit . ( SANTEE holds CODY 'S arm and slowly injects the serum . CODY becomes calm and speaks very evenly . BEAUJO looks on . ) CODY The white buffalo . Approach him in a sacred manner . He is Wakan . The ground he walks is Wakan . This day has sent a spirit gift . You must take it . Clean your heart of evil thoughts . Take him in a sacred way . If one bad thought is creeping in you it will mean your death . You will crumble to the earth . You will vanish from this time . DOCTOR Santee , hand me my scalpel please . It 's in my bag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOCTOR a scalpel from out of the bag . A series of knocks at the door . The DOCTOR remains cool . ) DOCTOR Beaujo , would you mind answering that . It 's probably our waiter . ( BEAUJO crosses to the door as the DOCTOR cuts into the back of CODY 'S neck with the scalpel . CODY makes no sound . BEAUJO swings the door open . A shotgun blast throws him clear across the room . He lies in a heap . CODY 'S two brothers , JASPER and JASON , enter . They 're both about six foot five and weigh 250 lbs . each . They wear Wyoming cowboy gear with dust covering them from head to foot . Their costumes should be well used and authentic without looking like dime-store cowboys . They both carry double-barreled twelve-gauge shotguns and wear side guns on their waits . The DOCTOR turns suddenly toward them . Another shotgun blast from JASPER . The DOCTOR sinks to the floor . SANTEE reaches for his pistol and is cut down by both shotguns at once . FINGERS whimpers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CODY sits on the bed with the back of his neck bleeding . He does n't know where he is . JASPER crosses slowly over to FINGERS with his spurs jangling . He peers down at him. ) p. 49 JASPER We come fer our brother , mister . You so much as make a twitch and you can kiss tomorrow goodbye . JASON ( crossing to CODY ) Come on , boy . We 're goin ' home now . CODY One bad thought . A clean heart . JASON ( helping CODY to his feet ) Come on now . You gather yerself together . A little beef stew in yer gullet , you 'll be good as new . CODY ( standing ) In a sacred way . This day . Sacred . I was walking in my dream . A great circle . I was walking and I stopped . Even after the smoke cleared I could n't see my home . Not even a familiar rock . You could tell me it was anywhere and I 'd believe ya ' . You could tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly out the door as JASPER backs out keeping his eye on FINGERS . They disappear out the door . A short pause . The WAITER enters briskly into the room carrying a silver serving tray with three bottles of booze and sparkling glasses . He stops short center stage and looks around the room at all the corpses . His eyes finally fall on FINGERS who moans softly . ) WAITER Is there something I could get you , sir ? FINGERS The record . ( gesturing to the album ) Put the record on . p. 50 WAITER Very good sir . ( The WAITER puts down his tray and picks up the record . He puts it on the record player . The song plays . It is " Zydeco et pas sale " on Side 2 of Clifton Chenier 's Very Best , on EMI , Harvest Recordings . The WAITER stands and listens to the tune as the lights fade . The music continues as the audience leaves. )                  @ @ @
