Although it is an incredibly massive structure  --  the center of the dome rises nearly ten stories above us  --  it is built like a pressure cooker . There are no windows , no ventilation , and only mighty pressure doors for access . The scale is staggering . Three- and four-story pumps and pressure tanks shoot up from the foundation , all tied into a central steel and concrete pit by girders and pipes large enough for a man to stand inside . In and around the oversized equipment is a web of crawlways and catwalks . The heavy explosion-proof lamps that dot the building do their best to light it , but there is the pervading atmosphere of the subterranean  --  it is a cavern worthy of the monstrous power that lives here .
