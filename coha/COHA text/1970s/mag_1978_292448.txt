The House rejects the President and votes a tax cut of its own <P> " What is the Administration proposal ? " House Speaker Tip O'Neill inquired somewhat rhetorically last week . <P> " I do n't know what it is . Does anybody know what it is ? " <P> The subject of O'Neill 's derision was that basic concern of practically every American : taxes . President Carter last winter proposed a tax cut of $24.5 billion to stimulate the economy , as well as a series of controversial " reforms " highlighted by a levy drying up the " three-martini lunch " as a business deduction . But as the economy recovered , the House Ways and Means Committee reduced the tax cut and threw out almost all the reforms as well . <P> Only two weeks ago , as the House committee was completing its work , did the Administration come up with a complex new tax bill . " Even the sponsors do n't understand it , " charged Ways and Means Chairman Al Ullman in the midst of last week 's nine-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy . His committee 's bill , he said , is a " strong response to a nation worried about inflation and a message to the middle-class families of this nation that they are n't forgotten . " <P> The House agreed ( and the Senate will probably take a similar stand next month ) . It voted down the Administration 's proposals , 225 to 193 , and approved the Ways and Means Committee bill 362 to 49 . That provides an overall tax cut of $16.3 billion . The message will not entirely appease the middle class , however , since the cut translates into an average of only about $163 per year in savings for the individual taxpayer . Because of the large increase in Social Security taxes scheduled to go into effect in January , many members of the middle class will be paying more to the Government than before , even with the tax cut . <P> The House bill trims individual income taxes by $10.5 billion , mainly through the device of widening the brackets so that people will not move so quick ly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softens the impact of inflation on taxes . Other elements : <P> &gt; The personal exemption is boosted from $750 to $1,000 . <P> &gt; The standard deduction is increased by $100 , to $2,300 for single persons and $3,200 for couples . <P> &gt; The corporate income tax rate is shaved from 48% to 46% , thereby achieving an estimated saving of $5 billion a year to businesses . <P> &gt; The 10% investment tax credit for spending on plant and equipment has been made permanent and has been broadened to include rehabilitation of existing structures . <P> &gt; Capital gains taxes are cut $1.8 billion by reducing the maximum tax from 49% to 35% , a compromise with the amendment of Wisconsin Republican William Steiger , who proposed slashing the tax to 25% . <P> &gt; Homeowners smarting from high property taxes are given a once-in-a-lifetime break . They can pocket up to $100,000 tax-free from the sale of their homes - but they have to pay the regular capital gains tax on any houses they sell after that . <P> &gt; The capital gains tax is tied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital gains that result from inflation .
