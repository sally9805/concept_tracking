 | Although uncertainty is king in today 's world , and many things seem out of control , we ourselves have more power than we may realize to attain and maintain a committed love relationship with one special person . This love is the seedbed in which the positive values of our lives flourish . It is more to be valued today than ever before , precisely because we are living in a time of such extreme , roller-coaster change . I have written Learning to Love Again to show how even people who have had disappointing experiences with the opposite sex can learn from past experience rather than repeat self-defeating behavior . There is a second chance for everyone . Sound marriages can be revitalized and strengthened , and people who have despaired of ever finding love can attain their long-sought goal . To learn to love again means to learn to love in new ways ? ways in which two people can grow as whole persons rather than as half persons . Each of us brings past behavior to our present situation . The habits we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well blind us to our real choices and possibilities today . Years back , when I was a sales manager for a reducing salon , I saw many very attractive , but anxious , women . Most had reached a deadend in their marriages . Their husbands were inattentive , bored , quarrelsome or having affairs . These women believed the only way to " save " their marriages was by recapturing the figures they 'd had when they were 20 . " If my hips were not so large and my stomach more firm , John would still love me , " Jane , an unhappy wife , told me ? really believing that if she firmed her body , her family difficulties would vanish . She would again be lovable and loved . But sadly for Jane , and the many like her , even when they improve their physical conditions , their marriages often continue to deteriorate . Some are shocked and puzzled to find out later that the " other woman " their husband turned to was dowdier or heavier than they . These women are what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything could be solved by a new dress or a new color hair . And when the dress or the hairdo no longer worked , they despaired . The idea that there was more to love than appearance never entered their minds because as children they believed their parents loved them mostly because of their physical attributes , the way they looked . The same thing happens to all of us in a variety of ways . Our earliest experiences of what we think love is and how we can get it , provide us with the spectacles through which we may be seeing relationships today in our adult life . But a child lacks the experience to interpret the world accurately . That 's how we get into trouble as adults ? by continuing to look at our love relationships through the distorted lenses of childhood . And so we let ourselves be blocked by the past because we hold firm to early , immature , childhood notions of what love is all about . But we do n't have to be prisoners of our early years . What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the truths of the past and then to give up those immature , dependent , childhood conceptions of love . That way , we can expand our opportunities for finding a new love or renewing an old one . How did you learn to love ? Do you recognize something of yourself in the following personality types ? If so , perhaps you will find ways to move out of the past , into a better , more loving future . As I 've already pointed out , THE EXTERNALIZERS define their own value and the value of others by appearance , money and status ; they lack a sense of esteem . They put their energies toward accumulating things rather than relating to people . When The Externalizers become aware that a new wig or a fivepound weight loss does not bring forth a lasting love relationship ,  | they may find themselves attracting people who like the reality of who they are rather than what they pretend to be . THE DON'T-MAKE-WAVERS grew up thinking that love means the absence of punishment . Mom and Dad never listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others seem stronger and more capable , they remain unassertive , inconspicuous , and conformist . That is the only way they feel they can be loved . " Nobody 's interested in what I think or say , " Mary , 25 , claims . When The Don't-Make-Wavers understand that their unassertiveness turns people off , they may assert themselves and find out then that they are more appreciated . THE MARTYRS believe they will be loved only if they please and serve everybody . They complain when their full-time sacrifices go unappreciated . But pleasing others is what life is all about , is n't it ? This is what their parents expected them to do , and they carried their parents ' expectations into their adult lives . " If I go out of my wa'y all the time to help people , they will love me in return , " Mabel , 41 , says . When The Martyrs discover that pleasing others at the expense of themselves creates stored-up resentment that shows in their behavior , they can attract new kinds of people to themselves or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passively receive each day 's largesse or disappointment . Making things happen for the better is only for other peo- ple . They learned long ago that their attempts to affect the world around them were doomed to failure . Mom and Dad treated them as if they were pieces of furniture . Any love or affection their parents gave them was an accidental treat . " It 's the breaks . Finding someone to love is like being in a crap game hitting a lucky seven , " Henry , 36 , says . When The Drifters realize they are no longer Mom and Dad 's cap . tives and can make independent decisions , then they can effectively present their personalities to others . Attaining good relationships will no longer be a matter of luck . THE YESTERDAYERS were Mom and Dad 's cute little girl or manly boy who could do no wrong . Their whims were always satisfied and they were never disciplined . Passive response was all that was required to attain love . Grown-up life , on the other hand , demands their active participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consequently they retreat into the past . For them yesterday is always better than today ; and the farther back in the past that yesterday is , the rosier it seems in the light of the demands the present makes on them . " They do n't make women today like the kind of woman my mother was , " Jim , 35 , says . When The Yesterdayers recognize that nursing the past is a security blanket that guarantees only the " safety " of no new or close relationships , then living in the present can become a challenge to expand relationships rather than a threat to the memories they hold so dear . THE FUTURIZERS are the mirror images of the Yesterdayers . They learned to survive the pain of insufficient love in their earlier years by believing that today is not important . It 's what will happen tomorrow that counts . " Love is just around the corner . " " I 'm waiting for Mr. Right . " " Just wait and see ? one day soon , he 's going to show up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that it is what they do today that determines whether or not tomorrow is bright , they may begin to see the opportunities for new or good relationships that were always present . But they had blinded themselves . THE ME-FIRSTERS learned early that life is a jungle and nice guys finish last . Niceness , to them , is weakness ; to trust anyone is to be hurt in return . Deception and force decide who is to survive . Because they were lovelessly dealt with when they were growing up , people are objects  | to be manipulated with guile and contempt . Their parents were always untrustworthy ; the promised birthday presents never materialized ; and Mom said she loved them but that was just an excuse to get them to do the chores . " All women try to con you into marriage . No way ! " Don , 34 , says . When The Me-Firsters see that their contempt for others reflects the hatred they feel for themselves and that loving others is a sign of strength rather than weakness , then life can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up escaping problems by erasing them . The violent arguments between their parents were so painful they had to be blocked out of their consciousness . They believe problems vanish if they are not seen or heard . They are the people , like Amy , 43 , who say truthfully in great bewilderment , " But I never saw anything wrong ; I thought we were both happy the last 15 years . " She says this when her husband asks for a divorce because he felt those 15 years were excruciatingly dull . And that bewilderment of " never having seen anything wrong " recurs again and again , since these people have never taken off their blindfolds and earplugs . When The Erasers see that denying difficult realities leads to the ending of relationships rather than their continuance . they can begin to improve the quality of relationships by recognizing and dealing straightforwardly with the problems . THE AGONIZERS derive meaning out Of life from worrying 24 hours a day over what they have done or might do . Childhood was the time when nothing was certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knew if they 'd be hugged or slapped , fussed over or rejected . How could they trust people to be " there " when needed , particularly the people they loved ? " He said he wants to see me this Friday , but I know from the tone of his voice he does n't really want to ? or does he ? " Alice , 27 , says . When The Agonizers understand that no one but themselves can give them the guidelines for living that they seek from others , new possibilities for better relationships open up . THE WALLOWERS are close relatives of the Agonizers . They comfort themselvers by believing that self-pity is the only balm for the slings and arrows that come their way . Their self-pity is a poor substitute for lack of love in their earliest years . To tell them their life is n't so bad is to risk the inevitable reply that Judy , 32 , gives , " But you do n't know how really bad it is . You do n't know what I put up with day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their past can only muddy their present life , old losses will be cut and new gains can become possible . THE CONTROLLERS fear behavior they ca n't control . Their parents taught them that love was a scarce commodity only to be earned by a nice little girl or boy who never got angry , never dirtied clothes . Spontaneity was a punishable offense . Super-organized orderliness , control of feelings , listmaking were ways their parents taught them to love . Any step in a new direction is seen as a step toward chaos . They have banished the possibility that chance and adventure could enrich their lives . " But I ca n't do that ? I 've never called up a man before he called me in my life . It just would n't be me if I did that , " Sally , 37 , says . When The Controllers realize that life is uncertain , they can see in each new day new possibilities for improving the quality of their relationships , rather than for reconfirming past rejections . THE SHOULD-FRS believe they ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were considered bad if they conflicted with Mom and Dad 's conceptions about how they " should " think , feel and act . To win love and approval , they conformed to their parents ' ideas of right and wrong . " I 've done all the right things so why should all my relationships turn as sour as they always do ? " Maria , 39 , says . When The Should-ers learn that accepting their own feelings will help them to have healthier ties with others , good relationships will follow . THE RIGHTEOUSLY ANGRY feel they were cheated of sufficient love when they were young . They were always  | second best ; brothers and sisters got more attention than they did . The fact that no one recognized their worth left a pool of angry feelings inside them . " Why does my husband tell me I 'm too demanding and touchy ? It 's because he 's inconsiderate and self-centered ? that 's why , " Edna , 45. erupts . When The Righteously Angry understand that anger in evitably alienates people , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they ascribe to others , they can then radiate attention and caring . THE RESENTMENT COLLECTORS feel their parents forced them into a mold . If they were boys , they would be loved if they never cried . If they were girls , they won affection by being nice and never angry . They stored up -- but never expressed ? the resentment they felt at not being permitted to release their feelings . " Now that Jim has walked out on me , " Amy , 28 , says of the man she thought she was going to marry , " I can see he annoyed me in so many ways , it 's a wonder I stayed with him as long as I did . He really was n't worth the trouble . " When The Resentment Collectors recognize that resentment creates the dust that blinds their eyes to the friendly signals other people are sending out to them , they can become alert to those signals and respond in kind . A curious thing frequently happens when people marry or remarry . The two , who saw each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniqueness of each other 's personality , now try to change each other into their own images of personal need . This happens to many wellmeaning , intelligent people . It happened to my new wife Pat and me . It all began with different food habits . After we married , dinners seemed to get bigger and bigger . If it was n't pasta , cheese and garlic bread , or corned beef and cabbage , it was Swedish meatballs and strawberry shortcake . I could see Pat anticipate my pleasure as we sat down and prepared to eat the meal . But I ate only small amounts , while Pat cleaned her plate . " Eat more . Do n't you like my food ? " Pat would always ask . I would reply that the food was marvelous , but I was not very hungry . At the beginning she accepted that explanation . But when I continued to be " not hungry , " resentment and hostility began to flash in her eyes . Our dinners became times of irritation rather than pleasure . What was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interdependent couple . The many good things happening in the early months of our marriage had already disproved the idea that a new relationship must repeat the destructive old ways of relating . Pat and I felt increasingly supportive of each other 's feelings and actions . We shared our hopes and frustrations about both our careers . We were more open and honest with each other than we had ever been in previous relationships .  | But neither of us applied this openness to our dinner-table difficulties . I had sensed that the ritual of large dinners was terribly important to Pat . I felt that if I told her how 1 really felt , it would hurt her . So I kept silent . I felt that if I hurt her , she would hurt me by withdrawing her love . But our silences were increasing rather than diminishing the tension between us . My fear of losing Pat 's love was actually causing the loss of that love . One night when I had pushed away a giant plate of spaghetti , Pat finally exploded . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say so ? Your eating habits are rotten . " My immediate inclination was to reply in anger . But instead I concentrated on the fear that I felt was at the bottom of her explosion . I asked her why she put so much importance on my eating everything on my plate . I told her I came from a family in which we ate on the run , at no set time . Besides , long before I met her , I had conditioned myself to small portions . And while Pat might be hungry at six every night , I was often not . After I asked why she felt I had to react to dinner the same way she did , the answer came : Love me , love m food . For Pat , as for many women , an elaborate dinner is an act of love . " I want to do nice things for the person I love , " Pat said . " My mother really could cook up a storm for me father , my sisters and me . Dad expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinner was a happy get-together time and Mom always beamed when Dad praised her cooking . It was his way of telling her he loved her . But you do n't care about all the work I go through . All you do is push the plate away without a thank-you . Maybe you 're growing tired of me . Maybe I 've done something that has turned you off . I love you so much , but I feel I 'm losing your love and I 'm miserable . " So there it was ? at long last we had reached the heart of our difficulty . At the base of the problem was a terrible fear of losing each other 's love . Better to deny the fear and accept the silent anger , rather than touch the terror inside that screams that our loved one might disappear ! No matter how old a person is , the need for love is so basic that the threat of its disappearance takes each of us back to the ways we were conditioned to love as children . At the dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our love created an emotional connection with the people we cared for most deeply as children ? our parents . Pat felt she had to show me the love she knew from her childhood ? the six o'clock giant dinner . We had been viewing love the way children view it : as a precious possession . won or maintained at the expense of our individuality . This is the rock on which intimate love relationships are most likely to founder . A dinner estrangement can , over the months and years , mount up to towering resentments over different opinions on money , sex , children , in-laws , and values ? unless the fundamental fear of becoming unloved is understood and dealt with . Old ways of relating die hard . Our awareness of what was happening in our relationship had to be expanded and communicated to each other as we lived each day of our marriage . We had to alert ourselves to our tendency to treat the other person as an extension of our needs and to treat love as a reward and punishment system . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whodunnit , " we became able to relax and tolerate each other 's dinner habits . We are " two-gether " instead of " together " at the dinner table and we have carried over that approach to other areas of our lives . All of us , in dozens of ways , must learn from our past in order to improve the quality of our present life . You do not have to go through the pain and disarray of divorce to transform self-defeating old habits into constructive new behavior . At any point in your life , you can free yourself of childhood notions of love , take more effective charge of the direction of your love relationships and , in short , learn to love again .
