Although a speck on the world map , Guam may soon become the hub of America 's presence in Asia . Most potential of all American colonies , the island 's economic potential is now being recognized for the first time. , It is within 1,500 miles of both Tokyo and Manila , and is fast becoming part of the Asian economic orbit after long years of isolation and secrecy imposed by the American military . Guam has probably changed more in the past five years than in the 250 years since the Spanish seized the island . A sleepy port of call since it became an American colony during the Spanish-American War , it is experiencing an astounding annual growth rate of more than 25 per cent . More than a dozen hotels have transformed - once tranquil Tumon Bay into a junior Waikiki ; the newest of them is the tallest building between Honolulu and Manila . More than 6,000 new homes have been completed in the past lour years alone . Tourism , almost all of it from Japan , has become Guam 's most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now Japan 's most popular " Caribbean " island ; it was the destination of almost a third of Japan 's world travelers . Five years earlier , only 3,500 tourists had stopped at Guam . Roger Gale , former chairman of the Department of Political Science , University of Guam , is the director of Friends of Micronesia in Berkeley , Calif . But despite the sudden ' . tourist boom , the U.S. military , hidden behind its fences , is still the mainstay of the economy . It employs more people and buys more services than does any other activity on , the island . According to Navy figures , the $171 million it spent last year constituted a full , one-quarter of the island 's ' economy . It , was only a few years ago that the Navy relinquished control of the island 's power , phone and water systems . Until 1963 , in fact , permission from the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington was needed to visit the security-conscious island . In the past decade , especially during the war in Indochina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence has grown immensely , but security has become less of a preoccupation . Although Guam is the Navy 's , largest home port , and will grow even larger next year when six new destroyers are transferred to the island , the military now has a rival for economic predominance on the island . Like the military , it does not wish to advertise its presence , but in the past few years investment and land speculation have become a major industry on tropical Guam . A free port , with casual accounting practices , Guam has become a haven for excess Japanese yen and ? since Nixon 's visit to China , 1 for insecure New Taiwan dollars . Because large contracts are becoming scarce in Vietnam , South Korea 's largest construction firms have moved their major foreign operations to Guam . As a result of all this new money , between 1972 and 1973 bank deposits rose a phenomenal 300 per cent and recorded loans increased almost 700,3 per cent . , With a population of 105,000 and a density per square mile of 500 , Guam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one-third of the 206-square-mile island is in U.S. military hands , so land prices in prime areas have shot up to as high as $1 million an acre . Speculation in tract homes still to be built by Kaiser Industries or by one of the Korean construction firms , has raised the cost of the average , two-bedroom house to about $50,000. 1 There are a number of reasons for Guam 's sudden boom . One , of course , is the publicity it received during the bombing of Indochina . Others have more substance . Says John Stanley , a retired Army colonel who is a con- , sultant to Japan 's Fujita Hotel chain , " ' Guam+ is American and therefore is stable . There is virtually no place in the Pacific that has had less internal turmoil and strife . At the same time , there is no place in the Pacific which has so many investment opportunities with so little government scrutiny . " Being until recently within a $150 round-trip air fare of Tokyo and Osaka has made Guam the first choice of lower-middle-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is open , businessmen are responding to the island 's charms . Guam is also a free port and therefore attractive to producers and retailers of high-cost , low-weight goods like watches and cameras , Watches , which are partially assembled in a number of small factories on the island , can be imported into the United States at reduced tariff rates . In the future , it 's location at the " mouth " of Asia will be a more important factor in Guam 's growing role as a transshipment point to and from the U.S. mainland . Because Guam 's economy is almost all " store-bought , " with agriculture nearly nonexistent , ships now return to the West Coast almost empty . . As an air hub , Guam has grown in five years from a one airline island to being served by six regularly sched-d uled airlines and a number of charter and transient air- craft . A new $25 million air terminal is in the works . Guam is already the world 's , biggest cable crossing , and a new trans-Pacific cable now being laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The island is also the " CommuniCations Area Master Station " for the Pentagon , coordinating all military communications in Southeast Asia , Japan and the South Pacific . Although the local labor supply is small and fully employed by the military and the government of Guam , cheap nonunionized labor from the Philippines ; and Korea is easily imported . Receiving the minimum wage ( a good part of which has to be sent home to their families ) and living in military-style barracks , workers are hardly in a good bargaining position . - In addition to all these attractions , Guam is virgin territory in an area that is being picked over and ripped off by multinational corporations based in Japan and ' America . It has attracted the largest Korean construction companies , but most of the Japanese and Chinese investors remain middle-scale . Perhaps unable to compete with their bigger corporate colleagues elsewhere , they have staked out Guam as their own . Nevertheless , Guam remains firmly under American control . Retiring Congresswoman Julia Butler Hansen , ( D. , Wash , ) sounded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian " peril " on American turf , but in the long run she probably has little to worry about . Not only is the military still the major component in any financial calculation but the island 's whole infrastructure is also in American hands . Banking is dominated by the worldwide threesome : Chase Manhattan , First National City and Bank of America , Petroleum is the monopoly of Mobil and Exxon and almost all imported capital goods are of American manufacture . In - numbers too , Americans are clearly in charge ; 40,000 of the island 's population are what are known ' as " statesiders . " Relations between the military and the new economic invaders , while not intimate , are hardly strained . Tourism and the military are good partners . During the height of the mainland bombing , B-52 crews were housed in the new hotels along with Japanese honeymooners . Lolling on beaches , drinking , carousing , and shopping are as much the past.mes of the typical military man from Dubuque as they are of the typical tourist from Nagoya . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury hotels is manned at least part of the time by an Air Force or Navy enlisted man who would rather work an extra job than idle away his spare time in the barracks . Yet , being a relatively small market 6,1500 miles from the - U.S. mainland has meant that the island has not attracted an abundance of large-scale American corporate investment . This may not always be so . Guam is buzzing with the idea that in the next decade it will be transformed into an American corporate center and entrepOt , like Singapore . The Stanford Research Institute is now completing a study on how to attract more business and the government of Guam recently brought in a group of investment bankers for a week-long look at the island . Says John Kerr , the newly elected head of the Chamber of Commerce , " American businessmen in Asia will soon begin to see the advantage of relocating their regional offices here . To hurry them up , we 're sending out packets of information now to Americans all over Asia . " Three years ago , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian- offices to Guam . Since then , a few small American firms have followed . Now , the National Maritime Union is moving its Yokohama offices to Guam . The tentacles of the American empire are hardly being withdrawn from Asia , but in parallel with the present American military pullback to Guam and the surrounding islands , American firms are now looking for more secure bases . Says a Chase Manhattan executive on the island , " The fact that five big American banks have set up shop here is a sign of something . At first , people used to think being transferred here was a demotion ; now people are beginning to see otherwise . As far as I 'm concerned Guam is the best place to be based in Asia . . . . " This year Guamanians became a numerical minority on their own island . If you count " stateside " Americans as foreigners , as the natives do , there are almost as many aliens on Guam as in Hawaii , where the population is eight times larger . The scheduled 20 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asians means that in the next three or four years , more than two-thirds of the island will be populated by foreigners . Even when Guamanians were in the majority , control of the island had long since passed from their hands . Joe Murphy , editor of Guam 's Pacific Daily News , estimates that 70 to 80 per cent of the island 's businesses ( including the newspaper ) are foreign-owned and that considerably more than half the island 's land is either leased or owned outright by non-Guamanians . But the sudden realization that they no longer even form the majority of the population has provoked the most vociferous reaction on the part of Guamanians since the bloody Spanish conquest of the island . In April the twenty-one member Democratic-controlled legislature voted 18 to 2 that aliens no longer be allowed to own land on the island . The two votes against the bill were cast by the two statesiders in the otherwise Guamanian body . The bill has since been vetoed by Republican Governor Carlos Camacho , after intensive lobbying on the part of the Chamber of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which inspired a series of hard-hitting newspaper columns on Guam 's colonial ' status . Sen. Frank Lujan , chairman of the commission , says the people of Guam have been kept dependent by a series of " colonial myths " which have led Guamanians to believe that they have no choice but to remain in the American political orbit . The Pacific Daily News refused to run any more columns on the subject after the publisher reportedly deemed them " anti-American . " The most widespread response to recent events , however , has been a revitalized attempt to force the military ' to return unused land and to pay retroactive compensaL tion for land unfairly and illegally expropriated since World War II . A report by the Guam legislature claimS there is adequate evidence to prove that at least 100 fam , ilies have had their land taken away from them under questionable circumstances . " We believe , " say the authors of the report , " that threats , coercion , appeals to patriotism , and fear of military reprisal cumulatively led to the turning over of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because Guam was under Navy rule when the bulk of the land transfers took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s , there were no civilian lawyers or real estate appraisers on the island , nor was there in existence any legal apparatus for appealing eminent domain proceedings . In April 1974 , Antonio B. Won Pat , Guam 's nonvoting representative in the U.S. House of Representatives , finally received permission from Phillip Burton , chairman of the House ' Subcommittee on Territorial and Insular Affairs , to hold hearings on land titles . Because of the statute of limitations , few Guamanians can go to court for retroactive compensation or to get their land back . Accordingly , Won Pat introduced a bill in Congress to waive the statute of limitations for one year so that claimants could file in Federal District Court . Further hearings are scheduled on the bill , but it has taken three years to get the House to call hearings , and it is unlikely that any action will come during the current session . The Pentagon , worried about this potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The military has returned a few small parcels of land in the last year but , as one Guamanian pointed out when the Navy announced its latest offer , " What a joke ! The Navy is leasing our own land back to us so we can construct a ' school for military dependents . " At the same time that it is returning small parcels of land , the Navy is moving to buy Guam 's last undeveloped shoreland for a $250 million ammunition wharf . Alienation , especially among the youth . of the island , has led to an increasing amount of politically motivated crime . Crime against Japanese tourists has become so widespread that it is front-page news in the Japanese press despite attempts by the Japanese hotel managers to keep it quiet . Only one honeymooner has been shot so far , but there have been random shootings at hotel windows , and purse-snatching is almost commonplace . Just after the shooting , the Pacific Daily News received a letter saying , " We will continue shooting Japs . " According to Director of Public Safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extortion on a ' hoodlum-for-hire ' basis " are also being reported in increasing numbers . To combat this rise in crime , Guam police are now being trained by Los Angeles and Honolulu police , and for the first time in Guam 's history the F131 has agents on the island . As a result of the crime wave , many people have come to think that Magellan 's men were right when they called Guam the Island of Thieves . For their own reasons , Guamanians too are beginning to find the appellation appropriate . Says one member of the legislature , " Our island is inhabited by thieves all right  --  the land speculators , the investors , and the military planners who are stealing more and more of ourland and our energies . " These " thieves " have ' made a shambles of the island . The phones do not work , traffic is bumper to bumper from morning to night , and - the island 's service industry and its bureaucracy will take years to adjust . The toll it has taken on the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of growth will soon be hitting the island . At least three more high-rise hotels are in the final planning stage and next ' year almost 4,000 additional Navy personnel and dependents will set up house on the island . Unless the world 's economy takes a dramatic turn , as some , economists predict , Guam is destined to becora the center of the new American Pacific . ?
