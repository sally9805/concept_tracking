To many of those involved in the fight against heroin addiction , methadone seems to be the most workable weapon yet devised . A synthetic morphine substitute , it relieves the symptoms of narcotic withdrawal , blocks heroin 's euphoric effects and allows an addict to lead a relatively normal life . But methadone also has its drawbacks . It is almost as addictive as the heroin it replaces , and most addicts must indefinitely maintain their new , though less destructive , habit . Because methadone is short-acting , it must be taken daily ; addicts starting treatment must either report to a clinic for daily dosages or be given several days ' supply at a time , a practice that opens the door to abuse . <P> The problem posed by methadone 's addictive properties remains to be solved . But two doctors at the University of Chicago 's Pritzker School of Medicine have experimented with a drug that may resolve the dilemma of distribution . Writing in the A.M.A. Journal , Drs . Jerome Jaffe and Edward Senay report that 1-methadyl acetate , a methadone-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three times as long as ordinary methadone . Therefore it decreases the temptation and the opportunity to cheat on the treatment by selling the heroin substitute for drug money . <P> Not Available . The pair base their report on a test involving ten addicts already under care in a Chicago drug program . Five of the subjects were given daily doses of methadone . The other five were kept on methadone during the week , but given a single dose of 1-methadyl acetate-plus placebos-to see them through the weekend . None of the ten knew whether he was receiving methadone or the new substance . <P> Physicians who examined the ten patients were unable to detect any clinical differences between the two groups . Nor were the addicts themselves able to distinguish between the drugs . All ten were equally able to resist the opiates to which they were addicted . For the present , 1-methadyl acetate is being produced only for investigational purposes and is not available for addiction-treatment programs . The Jaffe-Senay results are encouraging enough , however , to stimulate testing on a large scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
