was looking at me accusingly . But instead of being contrite , I had the feeling of being trapped . " She need not be lonely , " I said . " She can live here with you as your companion . You love her as a daughter . I will deed you this house . I will have no need for a place in Jerusalem hereafter , for I will be traveling . " There was no glint of interest in her eyes . " Is this your last word on the subject ? " " I shall not change my mind . I shall never marry . " Her voice was so cold that it filled me with foreboding . " Good , " she said , " for better the line should stop with you than there should be a son of your blood . " " Mother , " I cried , reaching for her hand . She drew away with a gesture of disgust . " Do not call me mother , for you are no longer my son . " My eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shook her head . " You have behaved abominably . You have violated a sacred trust , Judah .

We want nothing of yours . " " Please , Mother , you would fill me with guilt . " " You can still repent . " So that 's what it was , a trick to make me relent . " I have nothing to repent . " " You have betrayed an innocent child . " " You make too much of it . None will know . " " God will know . Is that not enough ? " I had no recourse but the truth . " She threw herself at me , " I cried . She drew back horrified . " You do not even play the part of the gentleman . " " I am sorry , Mother . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . But I will never marry . " She looked as if she were seeing me for the first time . " You think only of yourself , Judah . You arc not to be trusted . "  | " Every man has a right to make his own bed . " She bent her gray head for a moment to hide her tears , then brushed me aside as I tried to take her hand . " I can never forgive you , Judas , " she cried , using the Greek version of my name for the first time , as if to indicate the gulf that had come between us . " You have dishonored your father 's name . " I could think of nothing to say , but with it all I still felt a sense of relief that Rachel was out of my life . She walked slowly to the door and stopped a moment . " I never thought I would turn my back on my only son , but , with all your fine talk , Judah , you have no care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whims . And I warn you "  --  I thought I detected a break in her voice  --  " you shall one day suffer for the suffering you cause others through your self-indulgence . " The door closed and she was gone . I went to my chambers and meditated . It was all a bluff ; she would not leave the home she loved so much , with all its tender memories , for so slight a reason . I slept late , and upon awakening I could tell immediately from the servants ' frozen silence that something was amiss . " Your mother left in the night with your betrothed , " they said in hushed tones . I could feel the accusation in their voices . I decided that I would not spend another night in the house . It was hers , and she would come back after a while , grateful that I had turned the place over to her . She had often said she wanted to die near my father . I gave the keys to the chamberlain with instructionsthat he keep the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring her back . Go to Kerioth , her family 's home , and there she will be . " It would all work out . My mother would get over her pique , and Rachel would marry in time , given the proper dowry . She was a comely girl , but not overly bright . She would do well to marry somebody her own age . First things came first , in any case . I had my report to deliver , and I had to stay alert , to say no more than they already knew while saying enough to keep Gamaliel 's confidence , at least . As I passed again from the Court of Gentiles into the Court of Israel , Ip102shrugged at the sign warning Gentiles that they entered under pain of death . What a joke , for the Roman officials went wherever they liked , asking permission of nobody . The three were waiting in the same chamber as before . As Gamaliel embraced me , inquiring , as usual , about my mother , Caiaphas nervously tapped the floor with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cried . Gamaliel gave him a cool stare . " It will keep , " he said shortly . I saw Annas ' warning glance . It would not do to offend Gamalieland the Pharisee party . Annas sat in a comfortable chair , his hands calmly folded in his lap . " Do we have a Messias to report ? " he asked with a bland expression . " What does Sadoc tell you ? " I replied boldly . " You answer a question with a question . " " I am not blind . Both the Baptist and the one after him "  --  I was reluctant to speak his name before the High Priests  --  " were interrogatedby Sadducees and Pharisees alike . It made me wonder at my commission . " " You tell us nothing , " growled Caiaphas . " What can I tell you that the others have n't ? " " Tell us of your impression , man , " Caiaphas barked . " That was your assignment . " I had no intention of giving them any information that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to convince me that either man was the Messiah . Neither claimed this role for himself . " " Did not the Baptist salute the other as the Deliverer sent by God ? " " Even so , this would be only his opinion . " " But it was an opinion , " said Annas , " that influenced the crowd . " " Not the Essenes , " I countered . " They gave the Baptist precedenceover the other . " Annas looked at me closely . " Does this other not have a name ? "  | " He is called Joshua-bar-Joseph . " " Was he not baptized as Jesus , and called the Anointed ? Come , man , we are not fools . Why do you daily ? " I sighed heavily . " But again , this is only the Baptist speaking . Joshua-bar-Joseph claimed nothing for himself . " " Only that he was the Son of God . " " But he said we were all God 's children . " Gamaliel interceded gently . " What of the crowd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ? " " They were confused . Some had come , as I did , to determine whether the Baptist was the Messiah , only to find to their dismay that it was a mantle he would not wear . " Gamaliel 's brow had furrowed in thought . " Joshua-bar-Joseph . The name is familiar , but it is not possible . It was so long ago . It can not be the same . " I had no time to think of what he said , for Annas ' eyes bored into mine . " What of your friends , the Zealots ? Were they out in numbers ? " I had learned that a half-truth could be an ally in the art of dissembling . " A few were present , but they did not seem impressed by Joshua-bar-Joseph . " " What manner of a man is he ? " asked Gamaliel , with an interest he made no effort to disguise . I hesitated , but only for a moment . " He is a simple man , a Galilean , from Nazareth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gamaliel nodded approvingly . " A very good custom , for work is the anodyne of the masses , and he who does not work becomes a trouble to himself and the state . " Caiaphas ' foot was tapping again . " Where is this Joshua or Jesus now ? He seems to have disappeared into thin air . " " You seem more concerned with him than the Baptist . " " The Baptist is embarking for Perea . Herod will soon gobble him up . " I tried not to show my surprise . " How do you know of his movements ? "  | " As you said , " Caiaphas rejoined carelessly , " you are not our only observer . " " I do not seem to be of much use , " I said , not caring at this point whether I was retained or turned loose . There was little I could gain from them , except for that single slip , if such it was , revealing an agent in the ranks of the Baptist . There had been a dozen at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have discussed it with others . My mind ran over the company . The Zealots , Simon , bar-Abbas , Cestus , Dysmas , the Baptist himself , his two disciples , Jesus , the Galileans , Andrew and Simon-bar-Jonah , James and John , and me . How could it be any of them ? But then who would suspect that a grimy whiskey-monger was the stormy petrel of the revolutionaryparty ? Annas interrupted my reverie . " These are parlous times for Israel . It is essential that we give Pilate no provocation . " " He needs none , " I said , " only his natural detestation for a people different from himself . " " We must keep an eye on this Jesus . He is more dangerous than the other . " Garnaliel gave him a shrewd glance . " Why do you say that ? " " Fanatics we can deal with . They thrive on emotion , and that soon spends itself . But this one deals in reason , and is mild and moderate . He wears better . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said casually . " You see , " said Annas , " already he has a champion in Judah-barSimon . He must be a fine talker . " " He performed a miracle of healing . " " We have many healers in Israel and yet the sick throng to the shrines outside the Temple and throughout the land . " I gave vent to my frustration . " If he were the Messiah , would he not supplant the High Priests as the principal servant of the Lord ? " Annas eyed Gamaliel speculatively before he spoke . " The High Priests have survived a dozen Messiases . " Gamaliel 's eyes kindled.  | " If he is the Messiah , he will not hurt his homeland . For then he will be a true son of Israel . " Plainly he was different things to different people . " You will give us another report , " said Annas . I shrugged . " Where would you have me look ? " Annas tweaked his thin nose . " Where you know him to be . " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that it gave me a means of knowing what his adversaries were up to . " I will do what I can , " I said , which was surely no lie . Caiaphas had watched me malignantly . " We need somebody to watch the watcher . " " You already have that , " I rejoined sharply . His sallow face clouded with hostility . " I say let us move against this Jesus and be done with it . " " With what would you charge him , " Gamaliel asked sweetly , " that he urges us to repent of our sins and believe in the one God ? " " Give him enough rope , " said Annas , " and he will hang him-self . " " And Israel with him , " muttered Caiaphas . I was becoming increasingly aware of the underlying friction between the Nasi head of the Sanhedrin and the High Priests . " The Sadducees , " I said along these lines , " resist even the thought of the Messiah , while the Pharisees welcome the prospect but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approving smile . " Well said , son of a great Pharisee . Your father would be proud of you . " Hardly , I thought wryly , his praise only serving to recall my mother 's bitter words . The meeting had left me vaguely troubled . I allowed my mind to drift , blocking out my conscious thoughts ; for the unconscious mind , I found , was a better guide at times . And then it came to me : I had been sent to scout the Baptist , and yet there was no longer any interest in him , and no surprise that a stranger should supersede him . They were curiously well informed . On the way out I peered into an anteroom where the sacred shewbread was kept for the priests , and marveled at the doors andp106tables and candelabra of solid gold . There was a king 's ransom in this room alone , amassed by the sweat of thousands of pilgrims who faithfully paid their tithes in the hope of gaining salvation . In the Court of Gentiles my steps took me past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldly hawking his wares . He spotted me at almost the same time . " You have much business here , " he said with a leer . " No more than yourself . " He rubbed his dirty hands together . " Well said . " Then , looking around furtively , satisfied that nobody was in earshot , Joshua-barAbbassaid in a hoarse undertone : " Good work , keep them guessing , but tell them nothing . " " I have nothing to tell , " I said , " any more than you do . I assume that all our discussions are confidential . " " You assume correctly . " He pointed dramatically to the high mound barely visible over the west wall of the Temple . " Otherwise "  --  helaughed without mirth  --  " we will all be hanging upside down on a tree of Calvary . " " That may come , " I said pointedly , " if we do not hold our tongues . " My eyes traveled around the marketplace , from the moneychangers rattling their coins to the bickering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souvenirconsiderations . Bar-Abbas ' crafty face was covered with concern . " What is it , Judah ? Are you ill ? " " I was only thinking . " He drew closer , and his evil breath turned my stomach . He played his part well . " They must have been sour thoughts . " " I was thinking about what you said about manufacturing a Messiah . " " But we have one , Judah . You think so yourself . " I studied him closely . " Do you think so ? " He drew in some air and then let it out , laughing . " As long as the people think so , what else does it matter ? "  |p107THE  MASTER 'S FAME had already preceded him . Only fifty had been invited to the wedding , but some two hundred had turned out , ostensibly to honor the bride and bridegroom , but in truth for a glimpse of the prophet who had come out of Galilee . Simon Zelotes and I had to fight our way into the house . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thatched roof , for the father of the bride , Ephraim-bar-Anaim , was the wealthiest fishmonger in all of Galilee . I saw Andrew and Simon as I came in . They were conversing with two men I had not seen before , of about my age , or perhaps a year or two younger . The two brothers hailed us as old friends . We paused for a moment , looking vainly for the Master , then walked over to greet his first disciples . I was in for a surprise.  | " These two , " said Simon , indicating the strangers , " bring the disciplesto six . " Philip and Nathaniel were ordinary-looking men , nondescriptly dressed . I saw no distinguishing features . They came from Bethsaida , like Simon and Andrew , and were also fishermen . Nathaniel had become converted through Jesus ' visualizing him under a fig tree long before he had actually seen him . This flash of clairvoyancehad completely won him over . It reminded me of Simon-barJonah'sfish story . On what slim premises these simple Galileans turned over their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples ? " I asked with a twinge . " John and his brother James . They were called the day Jesus came down from the mountain . " My eyes continued to roam over the crowd , searching for the man whose charisma had drawn me to this dreary land . Andrew quietly put himself at our disposal . He pointed to a long table laden with rich foods of all kinds , fit rather more for the home of the High Priest or some Judean dignitary than for a Galileanfishmonger . I savored the variety of meats and game , fowl and stuffed fish , all flavored in the Jewish style with onion sauce , and a sparkling red wine which was excellent for Galilee . " Is it proper to take refreshments before the festivities ? " I inquired . " Many guests have come a long way , and so it was thought the better part of hospitality to minister to their wants so they could join in the gladness without fretting about groaning stomachs and parched throats . " The proud father was a kinsman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And where is he ? " I asked , still craning my neck . " In the atrium , with his mother and brothers . " " His brothers ? " Somehow he had seemed a man without family . " Joseph , Simon , Jude , and James are really his cousins , but Jesus ' father looked to their welfare when their own father died . " " And his mother ? " " Mary is one of the wonders of our time . She looks no older than he , they would easily be taken for brother and sister . "  | " There is then some resemblance ? " " Not in features , but perhaps in the radiance of their smiles . But judge for yourself . " A young-looking woman of an almost ethereal loveliness had come through the door and appeared to be looking for someone . She was dressed in a simple white gown that fell to her feet and wore a plain gold band around her swanlike throat . Her hair had an auburn tint and was curled back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark and piercing , yet with a gentleness that permeated her entire countenance . She moved gracefully , appearing almost to glide in our direction . " Have you seen him ? " she asked . There seemed almost a conspiracy to avoid his name , as if such familiarity was a presumption , even by his own mother . " Is there a problem ? " Andrew asked . " Because of the unexpected guests , Ephraim is embarrassed by a lack of wine . " I wondered how this could be Jesus ' concern . He seldom imbibedhimself and certainly carried no wine with him . But maybe the disciples had brought some as a gift . This was not uncommon . Andrew showed her the greatest deference . " Let me take you to him , " he said , motioning for me to follow . We threaded our way through the throng , everybody giving way before the solemn majesty of Andrew . I did not see Jesus at first , for a knot of people blocked him from view . " Wherever you see a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the center of it . " He was half reclining on a couch , telling a story , when Andrew caught his eye . He looked past Andrew at his mother , and a smile wreathed his face . She came to him and kissed him lightly on the forehead . He rose to his feet and embraced her . " Woman , " he said fondly , " what have I to do with you at this time ? " I thought his greeting a little harsh , but it was softened by his smile . And then I remembered that in Galilee " woman " was used as a term of affection . " They have no wine , " she said , as if that explained everything.  |p110As  I wondered why she bothered him with this irrelevant detail , he looked through the doorway at the milling crowd . " You do right to come to me , since my presence is surely the reason for the overflow of guests and the resulting shortage of wine . " Ephraim had overheard the conversation and , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about such a trifle . " You , sir , are our honored guest . " Jesus waved his objections aside . " Summon your servants , " he said in a commanding tone . When the servants came running , Jesus inquired how many stone waterpots were available for the ritual of purification , an important part of the wedding ceremony . After some hesitation , they replied : " There are six in number , each containing some eight gallons . " " Now fill these pots with water and show them to me . " Again they hesitated , looking uncertainly to their master . Before the master could so much as nod , Jesus ' mother said quietly : " Whatever he tells you , do exactly as he says . " Jesus trailed after them into the room where the pots were kept . " Now fill these pots to the brim , " he ordered . He made an airy motion of his hands and whispered under his breath , so softly that nobody could distinguish his words . " Now , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take them to the governor of the wedding feast , and let him give them out to the guests . " My eyes widened as I saw the red sparkling liquid flow into the clay pitchers . The servants seemed almost terrified by the transformationthey had witnessed , while our host turned the color of alabaster . But I saw only a pleased smile on Mary 's face , and Andrew 's only concern was that Jesus may have taxed himself with this chore . " Would you rest more ? " he inquired . " Now is the bride and bridegroom 's time , Andrew . My time has not yet come . " We preceded Jesus into a large room where the ceremony was to be performed . I was still overcome by a confused feeling of un/reality and was more curious about the wine than the couple to he wed . I noticed the governor of the feast , a hearty man with a red face , handing out goblets of the sparkling fluid to the eager guests . " Blessed be the creator of the fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was again filled with wonder , for this was the toast delivered only when the wine was unadulterated by water . Had they detectedwater in it , the toast would have been : " Blessed be the author of the fruit of the vine . " Ephraim , shaking his head incredulously , helped himself to severalheaping beakers of the liquid , as though to drown his wonder at what had transpired before his eyes . I drew a beaker myself and sipped slowly from the wine . It was exquisite , with a bouquet such as I had never known before . And so with the others I drank to the couple , thinking at the same time how unworthy they were to be the central figures of such an occasion . The bridegroom , a callow youth with a pimply face , hovered over his bride , a dulcet-eyed goose , who was trying to look demure while quivering with delight at the prospect of what soon awaited her . She was another Rachel , to be sure . The governor of the feast proposed a toast to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he turned to the smiling Ephraim with a gratified look . " At the beginning of a feast , " he said , " the host usually brings out his best wine . And then after the guests have drunk awhile , and are not able to distinguish the good from the bad , he commonly brings out the worst wine , considering that none will be able to tell the difference . But you , Ephraim , have saved the best wine until now . " Simon Zelotes ' eyes were as wide as mine . " He must surely be the Messiah , " he whispered reverently . It was now time for the wedding to proceed . Oddly , the wine had been served in clear , uncolored vessels , as was traditional with water , and from containers left uncovered . Ephraim , as his name betokened , was of the tribe of Ephraim , and kept the law , at least in honoring his virgin daughter . Jesus appeared to enjoy the ceremony.  |p112The  local rabbi , with his little skullcap , mouthed the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was broken , signifyingthe beginning of a new life together . The most solemn oaths of fidelity were exchanged under the shadow of the bridal veil . There was much kissing and embracing and the usual letting of tears , and then the bride , with great aplomb , was triumphantly carried from the house in a chair and through the street into the nearby house Ephraim had given the couple for a dowry . " Hosanna , hosanna , " the crowd cried good-naturedly . None seemed more radiant than Ephraim , not even the beaming newlywedstrying to hide their lascivious smiles behind a facade of innocence . I smiled to myself . How happy Ephraim must be . It was indeed worth all he had given and more to lose a daughter . At the same time I understood why Jesus had summoned us to Cana . Whatever doubts I may have entertained were washed away with the wine . " I see it now , " I told Andrew . " John at Bethabara baptized with water , but Jesus baptizes with a living water that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wills is the living water by which man is purified . The atmosphere holds no secrets from him . For through his Father in heaven he understands the laws of all creation , which have been universal since the first man . " We tarried after the wedding , Jesus wishing to exchange a few words with the friends who had come to acknowledge a prophet in his own country . For the most part they were bluff , open-faced Galileans , unmistakable by their speech . I had been relieved to see no Pharisees or Sadducees in the party . And then , with a start , my eyes alighted on the familiar face of a pious Pharisee , whom I knew as a friend of my father . They had served together on the Sanhedrin , and with Gamaliel and Nicodemus were the nucleus of the liberal party which dreamed of Israel 's redemption with the comingof the Messiah . He was standing in a dark corner of the room , his eyes riveted on the Master . There was a tender look in his long saturnine face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their wistful melancholy . I knew Jesus had nothing to fear as I marked his expression.  |p113I  could see the same yearning in his eyes that I felt in my own heart . Still , it gave me pause that a prominent member of the Sanhedrinshould have taken the trouble to ferret out the Master 's whereabouts and followed him to this abode . Bowing low , I addressed him with the deference due a distinguishedelder of Israel not of the Sadducee persuasion . " Joseph of Arimathea , what brings you to this humble dwelling ? " His eyes flickered with annoyance and then cleared somewhat as he recognized me . " I am not here in any official capacity and do not wish it known . " " As you will , sir . " " And what do you do here ? " I nodded to the small circle surrounding the Master . " I follow him . " " You do well , " said Joseph of Arimathea , " for he is the light of Israel and the hope of the world . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I speak frankly to you , not only because you are Simon 's son but because I know of your interest through the Reb Gamaliel . Know whom you follow , and listen not to idle talk . " " I do know , " I said . " I have seen him heal the sick and change the living water to wine . " He waved his hand in a gesture of dismissal . " That is nothing . What is important is that he is sent by God in fulfillment of ancient prophecy . I dreamed of him before he was born , and in this vision God revealed to me that I should not die until he proved himself . " " And now you have seen him ? " He smiled benignly . " Oh , I first saw him in the manger in Bethlehemwhen I followed the glorious star that foretold his birth . And this was not all , for with my own eyes I saw the two humble beasts of burden that symbolized his birth . " He held up a finger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ox knoweth his owner and the ass his master 's crib . Even these animals seemed to know they were parties to a great occasion . "  |p114What  a thrill it was to meet someone who knew him so well . The questions tripped off my tongue . " But was none there to assist in the birth ? " " Her husband , Joseph , helped , but God allowed the child to be born painlessly . " " But why , " I asked , " were they in the manger ? " " Such was the prophecy of the ox and ass , " he said , " but ostensiblythere was no room in the inn , for many had come to register for the census in the place of their birth . " " And so Joseph , too , was a Judean ? " " Of the House of David , as was Mary . " " Were there no others there ? " " The three wise men , being astrologers acquainted with the peculiar conjunction heralding his birth , had also followed the glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tarry long , for they were fearful that Herod the Great would find them out and destroy the child that prophecy said would grow up and become the King of Kings . " Caspar , Melchior , and Balthazar had looked into the makeshift crib and satisfied themselves that this was the Promised Child foreshadowedin Scripture . And Caspar , kneeling in prayer , had solemnlymurmured : " There shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall arise out of Israel . " Joseph of Arimathea had befriended the couple . He brought them food and comfort and went with them to the Temple in Jerusalem on the eighth day , when the infant was inducted into his faith with the sacrifice of the doves . Tears had come into the old man 's eyes . " I myself held the infant in my arms and assisted in the ceremony . And I blessed the Lord for this great privilege , praying that he would now let his humble servant depart in peace , for my eyes had seen the salvation which he had prepared before the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voice told me that my mission was not yet complete , not until I had once again witnessed his birth . " I looked at the old man with some misgivings . Had I been listening to a doddering old fool long past his prime ?  |p115He  smiled sardonically . " Have you never heard voices , Judah-bar-Simon ? " I shook my head and then with a start remembered the voice telling of the Kedron running red with the blood of man . " Yes , " I said soberly , " I have heard voices . " There had been still another unexpected visitor on that momentousoccasion , Anna , the seeress from Jericho , of whom but little was known . She was a toothless hag with a wicked leer , and her presence made even Joseph of Arimathea uncomfortable . Only Mary did not wince as Anna took the tiny babe in her horny hands and peered into that innocent face . " He is the one , " she cackled . " I give testimony to this before the forces of darkness and light , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no greater King in Israel than he , but his kingdom shall be universal , and he shall not reign till he is gone . " Only Mary seemed to understand , for she nodded , then closed her eyes as if to put the thought out of her mind . Joseph of Arimathea made a move as if to drive off the woman , but Mary stayed him with a gentle motion . " And how long shall I have him ? " she asked quietly . The old hag 's face wrinkled in thought . " He shall be with you until a new tyrant rules in Israel , one who shall be remembered only because of this child . " Her face softened and became almost beautiful in the transformation . " Blessed are you , Mary , for you shall be at the beginning and the end , and know both for what they are . " More than any other , this Anna had intrigued me . For she seemed to intimate great things though some was clearly witch talk . " What did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Joseph of Arimathea gave an impatient shrug . " I had no time for witches . It was enough that the child was born . " He had not yet told me why he was here at Cana . " I came to see his mother , " he said . " We have a great bond and comfort one another . "  | " And will you talk to him before you leave ? " " It is not necessary . He sees me here and knows that I am devoted to his family . I will be there , too , when he is ready , as you shall yourself , Judah . " I looked at him sharply . " What do you know of my mission ? " " Only what he knows . " It was vexing to be constantly confronted with these little enigmas , but Joseph of Arimathea had turned away and , with a wave of his hand , disappeared through the door . Again , I had more than an inkling that the Pharisee command was intrigued by Jesus and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this carpenter from Galilee . Gamaliel , Nicodemus , Joseph of Arimathea , all good and holy men with influence in the Sanhedrin , presaged strong support if it came to a vote . But how did one vote for a Messiah ? It was an absurdity that only the Sadducees would compound to curry favor with Rome . The meeting with Joseph had turned my mind back to the time when this great merchant had visited our home as though it were his own . My father would put aside whatever he was doing when this pious Jew came to pay his respects . Seldom did they talk business , except to speak of the grinding weight of the taxes . " We pay for Rome 's bread and circuses , " I remembered my father saying , " for those too shiftless to do an honest day 's work . " " Yes , " replied Joseph , " they keep the masses anesthetized with chariot races and gladiators and free corn , but one day they will demand more . " But mostly they sat and talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph that I first heard of the Messiah . My father listened closely , but I could tell he was not convinced . " You will not know him when he appears , " said Joseph , recallingthe Prophets . " With that I agree , " said my father good-naturedly . " I have seen him with my own eyes . His mother was young , but fourteen , and a virgin . His adoptive father , Joseph , was a simple Galilean carpenter . But both were of the House of David as the Prophets foretold . " My father playfully ran his hand through my hair.  | " And so is my six-year-old Judah . Would you call him the Anointed One ? " " The wise men knew him , for they had the glad tidings from God 's own angels , as well as the stars . They were without doubt , scorn , or fear . So all wise men approach their God .

" The Roman world , dear friend . His coming shall rock the Empireto its very foundations . " With all the talk of visions and voices , prophecies and premonitions , it was not surprising that a Messiah should materialize in the minds of men . And public acceptance , as bar-Abbas had intimated , was perhaps even more important than the actuality . Jesus ' public career had hardly begun , yet adoring crowds mysteriouslyappeared wherever he went . Stories of his transformation of water into wine could be counted on to spread like wildfire and add to his luster . As I watched the wedding guests thronging about him , anxious to touch or hear him , I was never surer that he was the Promised One . " One word from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take arms against Rome . " Andrew regarded me solemnly . " Is this why you follow him ? " " Is it not reason enough ? " " It is not our reason . " " Is it not enough that he is the Messiah ? " " We do not presume to tell the messenger his mission . " " Nor do I , but is it wrong to assume that the Deliverer of Israel must deliver her ? " We had been edging through the room to the couch where he half reclined . Simon-bar-Jonah and the other disciples hovered about him protectively , allowing nobody to touch him.  | " Each contact draws on his universal energy , " whispered Andrew . I considered for a moment . " Is this how he heals and enriches the water ? " " He does it all with God 's help . " " But something still takes place in him , and in the atmosphere ; there is a connection of some kind , for these wonders to mate-rialize . " Jesus had looked up at our approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come with us to Bethsaida and there shall our company be completed . " I envied his closeness with his disciples and again felt a longing to be one . But it could only be at his call , that I knew . " I will follow you anywhere , " I said . He had turned to Andrew . " See that Judah has lodgings in Bethsaida . We have much to do , and so little time . " He rose easily , and the crowd parted to let him through . Many bowed in reverence , and an excited murmur trailed after him as he moved into the street , where a few peasants raised the cry " Hail to the Son of David . " And others , first looking about carefully , added to this cry : " Hail to the King of Israel . " He frowned , and no wonder , for who knew where the spies of Rome or the Sanhedrin lurked ? I looked at Andrew to see how he took this tribute . " I am not the only one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " True , " he replied , " but we who follow him do so only because we believe in him . This you and Simon Zelotes must be ready to accept . " " Simon Zelotes ? " " Yes , he represents an important faction of the people . " Bethsaida was no more than I expected , another bleak Galilean fishing village with country clods in evidence wherever we went . The most prosperous citizens were Jonah , the father of Andrew and Simon , and Zebedee , the father of James and John . They owned not only several fishing boats in concert but a market for fresh fish and a fish-drying plant . The whole settlement smelled ofp119fish , but these hearty creatures with their red faces and great bodies did not even seem aware of the odor . Andrew had arranged for Simon Zelotes , Levi the Publican , and me to stay for the few days at the Zebedee household , and I must admit that they were a warm , generous family , though young John seemed to have taken a dislike to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come down from the mountain with Simon-barJonah , they had been called as disciples , baptized by Simon , who had been baptized along with Andrew by the Baptist but a short time before . Though all were fishermen they would cast no more nets in the Gennesaret Sea , which was popularly called the Galilean Sea . Over the dinner table , laden with a dozen varieties of fish and green vegetables , the handsome John , almost too good-looking for a youth , happily regaled us with Simon 's confusion at being told by Jesus that he was now a fisher of men . " Do you mean , " the wide-eyed Simon had asked , " that I can no longer cast a net with my father ? " " Only if there is a man in it , " Jesus had replied with a smile . More seriously , John described how the Zebedees had fished all day with their crew without taking anything in their nets until Jesus , speaking from the shore , had directed them to a certain spot where the waves formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you can handle . " " But we have fished there before , and our nets came back empty . " " Fish there again , " cried Jesus . John laughed boyishly as he recalled Simon-bar-Jonah 's amazementat the full nets they pulled back , so strained with the weight of the catch that the cords tore and the fish slid back into the sea . " It certainly made a believer of Simon-bar-Jonah , " he said . The story was an old one to me . " You were on the mountain quite a while , " I said , changing the subject . " A few days , " said John noncommittally , " and then Jesus spent some time healing the sick and the infirm on his way from the wilderness to his home in Nazareth. "  |p120As  I had surmised , Andrew had handled the arrangements for the stopover in Cana . My curiosity about the excursion into Moab had been heightenedby John 's evasiveness , which led me to believe that something momentous must surely have transpired . " Was the journey into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked as casually as I could . John and his brother exchanged glances . " There is nothing we can say about it , " said James . For a moment I felt excluded , and then with a shrug I dismissed the matter as of no account . The next day we were to meet with Jesus at Jonah 's house . " It will be good to talk to a man without secrets , " I said . This was the occasion for Salome , the wife of Zebedee , to say with some waspishness : " And why does not Jesus stay here , is our home not good enough for him after all these years ? " The good-natured Zebedee responded with a smile . " Now , Mother , he has his reasons . The mother of Simon-bar-Jonah 's wife is sick with a fever , and Jesus went to heal her . " " And she is healed ? " " But of course , " Zebedee said . " He merely touched her hand and the fever left her , and she arose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had then healed a host of others whom Andrew had arranged to be there , one of whom had attacked him before he could cast the devil out of him . The crusts and sores had fallen from another , a leper normally forbidden in the community , when Jesus passed his hand over the disfigured face . Levi the Publican had listened with a wondering look . " All this has been done , " he said , " to fulfill that spoken by Isaiah : He took away our infirmities and lay bare our sickness . ' " Salome looked up with a chuckle . " You are not saying that this village boy is the Messiah ? How absurd . " Her sons chided her with their eyes . " All right , " she said , " I know his mother had a vision , but many mothers have visions about their children . That establishes nothing . "  | " You will come to him on bended knee one day , Mother , and be happy to acknowledge that he is sent by God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James and I saw on that mountain . " " All right , John . " She kissed his forehead . " I fear that I feel only a mother 's resentment that my two sons give up their home and their right to a family of their own to follow the uncertain path of a leader who takes them God only knows where . " I had held my question for a while . " How is it that Simon-barJonahis a disciple , since the disciples must have neither wife nor child ? " " That is a good question , " put in Salome . " But Simon , like Andrew , leaves his wife and a child to be supported by old Jonah and his wife . You would think that he would pick only on single men . " John and James protested together . " But , Mother , " said John , " each disciple stands for something special that Jesus sees in him . " She snorted . " I am a Galilean born and bred , but since when does this remote region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this matter with any Judean you meet on the road . " In spite of ourselves , we all laughed together , and the tension was eased . " Go now , " she said , " and meet with your Savior . And bid him repair the bench he once made for this house . One of its legs fell off . I hope this has no great significance , for I understand he tells parables on less ground than this . " Zebedee shook his head wearily , and then his voice rose so that we understood why he was called the Thunderer . " Woman , hold your tongue . Your sons go to serve God . Any fool can tell that Jesus is no ordinary man , even if he did nothing but walk through this community without raising a hand to heal the sick or bless the whole . " She closed her eyes . " All right , " she said with a sigh . " I bid a tearless goodbye to the children of my womb . " I knew not what to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by a servant into an upstairs room . We were greeted quietly by Andrew and Simon-bar-Jonah , who wasp122variously known as Peter since his own baptism by John . Jesus sat in the center on a large cushion , his piercing eyes sending a welcome to us all . " I have summoned each of you for a reason that may not becomeapparent until your last breath . And then you shall know eternity , for you are the Chosen of God . Remember this well , however spitefully the world considers you : that for judgment came I into this world that they who see not may see , and those who see may become blind in their blindness . " His words fell swiftly like the strokes of a sword . " Six of you have already been blessed with the living water , and now the six remaining shall be sprinkled with the water of a new life , by Simon-bar-Jonah and Andrew , for I baptize not after John . " I could see the others were as excited as I was . Their faces were pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " First , " said Jesus , dropping his hand into the water , " let me bless the Holy Spirit which makes you as one with God , with hearts hungering to help humanity . " I felt myself tremble , thinking now how unworthy I was . Thoughts of Rachel and my mother , mingled with memories of my childhood , of Joseph of Arimathea , Nicodemus , Joshua-barAbbas , Cestus and Dysmas , Annas and Caiaphas , Gamaliel , all came crashing together in my head . Andrew beckoned Levi forward , and Simon-bar-Jonah , with a grandeur I would not have expected , sprinkled him lightly with water . Yet Jesus , though he did not baptize , still dominated the ceremony . " Levi the Publican , " said Jesus , " I name you Matthew . I took you from your office , and you are indeed , as this name indicates , a gift of the Lord . Your name shall be coupled with mine as long as God 's name is remembered , for you shall be our chronicler . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , Jesus said solemnly : " A proud son of Galilee , and a patriot as well , who speaks for the Zealots in their struggle to rid the homeland of the invader . Be as great a warrior , now , Simon , for an even greater cause . "  |p123Even  as I wondered what cause could be greater , his eyes looked fondly on the two sturdy Galileans who were obviously twins . " James and Jude , " he called , " sons of Mary of Alpheus , who stand as a constant reminder that no family ties are as meaningful as those consecrated in God . You who were my cousins are joined now by a bond dearer than blood . " The next was Didymus , whom he called Thomas , which also signified a twin . " You shall attain glory for leaving your doubts , and your own twin , for a doubtful cause . And though your doubts return , your faith shall redeem you . " " Judah ! " I jumped at his call . " A proud Judean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the unaccountable ways of the Lord you shall serve in your own way to establish the living truth of life everlasting . " Whenever the name Jesus Christ is mentioned , yours shall be added almost in the same breath . For though you are the twelfth to be named , your fame shall not be least . You shall be our treasurer , and guard the purse strings , for only a Judean versed in his father 's estates can manage our affairs well enough to keep flesh and spirit together while we minister to the poor . " His eyes held mine , and his dear face softened for a moment . " You , Judas , shall make your first excursion into the countryside with Matthew , who was Levi , and you shall carry my word and heal in my name . Remember that your power comes from the Father through his Son . For all things are delivered to me of my Father . And no man knows who the Son truly is but the Father , nor who the Father is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal him . " I had no sense of his power coming through me . How could I make the leper whole , or make steady the hand afl'licted with palsy ? He seemed to have read my mind . " I say this to the Twelve , all of whom I love equally , that with faith in the Father you can do what the Son has shown you to do . " I felt almost naked in my helplessness . " I low do we support ourselves ? " " Spoken like a true believer . " I-le had a sardonic smile . " Ask thep124birds and the butterflies , the lilies in the fields , which neither toil nor spin . God takes care of them , as he will you . Forsake not so much your worldly goods as your worldly thoughts , go forth like the deputies of the Lord , for that you are , and embrace the world with the love of God in your hearts . " Matthew , too , was confused . " And when begins my assignment to record this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already begun , for your mind is already teeming with the words heard here today , and the activities at Bethabara and Cana , and even on the mountain , where you were not . " Matthew still hesitated . " May I go anywhere and ask what I like about your mission from God ? " " Yes , even to Nazareth . " In nearly everything , Jesus showed an awareness of his Judean heritage . Just as Moses appointed twelve tribal chieftains , so Jesus chose twelve whom he called Apostles . " As Apostle means one sent , " he said , " you are sent for me . " We were also disciples , pledged to his teachings , but our apostolicauthority rested in the intimacy we shared as his family . " Henceforth I call you not servants , for the servant has no idea what his master is about . I shall call you my friends , for everything I have of my Father I shall pass on to you . You shall bring forth sweet and bitter fruit , and whatsoever you ask of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Each Apostle was authorized to name five disciples , Jesus himself selecting the rest , until there were seventy in all . Moses had named as many , and this number ruled the affairs of the Sanhedrin . In choosing this number did Jesus challenge the authority of the Temple elders ? He smiled . " Our whole ministry , Judah , is a challenge to what the Temple does . " Some of my brethren found me contentious , but as Jesus looked around at these pacific faces , he said with a reassuring twinkle : " I come not to bring peace but to stir up the established order . " Simon-bar-Jonah , as usual , held up his hand . " And how shall this be done , Master ? "  | " With the truth , for the truth is God 's revelation , and it does not vary from King David 's time to this . Do you not remember David saying to Solomon : Keep the charge of the Lord thy God , to walk in his ways , to keep his statutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony , that you may prosper in all that you do ' ? " There were smiles of satisfaction among these simple Galileans . For as they felt themselves moving in the footsteps of Abraham and Moses , they felt comfortably reassured . Except for Zelotes t here was not a revolutionary in the lot . Jesus had not finished . " And David spoke that day of the promisemade by the Lord . If your children walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul , there shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel . ' " " Are you he whom your father David mentioned ? " I asked . " I am he , " he said , smiling , " whom the Heavenly Father mentioned . " Philip reflected the general bewilderment . " Master , show us the Father , and we shall be satisfied . " " If you believe not in what I do , how can you believe in what Moses did ? " Matthew , whom I still thought of as Levi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he was already scribblingon thin sheets of parchment , with a ruffled brow . " If you come only to redeem Israel by the law of Moses , Master , how does your mission differ from Elijah 's , who banished false Gods from Israel ? " The Master sighed . " I do not come to change a tittle of God 's law . God cares not what man eats , nor on what platter it is served , as long as that man serves Him by loving his neighbor and himself . " I was not sure I had heard correctly . " Is this not a form of egomania , condemned even by the Greeks in their fable of the beautiful youth Narcissus , who fell in love with his own image and died of unrequited love ? " " To love oneself , as God would have it , one must first esteem his own being . He must be honest in all things , treat others as he would be treated , and be true to himself . Without self-respect , hep126cannot command the respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pillow . " Matthew was still not satisfied . " But are not the books of Moses supreme in Israel for all time ? " " In matters where God 's voice is plain . " " How does one know God 's voice from the interpreter 's ? " Jesus smiled . " You see , I have made a good choice . His gospelwill be preached even in Rome one day , and will be favored of theJews , even as John 's word will strike a chord with the Gentiles . " John blushed at being singled out . " Tell them , John , what you saw on the mountain . This shall be an answer to Matthew and the rest . " " But , sir , " said Simon-bar-Jonah , " you enjoined us to relate this vision to no man . " " True , " said Jesus , " but I keep nothing from any of you , for the knowledge shall be helpful in doing God 's work . What John and James and Simon-bar-Jonah were privileged to know then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John stood up , and his fair face , with its perfectly chiseled features , seemed to glow from within . " It was an exhilarating day , " said John , " the mountain air was crisp and clear , and there was not a cloud in the sky . I looked at Simon and James , and could see them breathing deeply , savoring the freshness as if it were wine . Then my eyes traveled to the Master , and I saw him in a white light , and his face shone as the sun . He appeared to be conversing with two figures cloaked radiantlyin the light , speaking as if they were Moses and Elijah . Simonbar-Jonahsuggested we make a tabernacle of branches of palm leaves for each of the prophets who appeared with the Master . But even as Simon spoke , a bright cloud loomed out of the blue sky and cast Moses and Elijah in its shadow , so that they were no longer to be seen or heard . A voice full of majesty then rolled out of the cloud and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I am well pleased . Listen to him . ' " At this heaven-borne voice , the disciples fell on their faces , afraid to peer into the cloud , for only Moses and Elijah had seen God 's countenance and lived . But Jesus reached down and touchedp127them . " Arise , and be not afraid , for there is no harm in your Father , " he said . As they came down from the mountain , the disciples looked apprehensively over their shoulders and spoke not of the voice but of Moses and Elijah . " Why , Master , " asked a tremulous Peter , " were these two overshadowedby a bright cloud , while the light remained with you ? " Jesus ' eyes held an ironic glint . " You have answered your own question , Simon-bar-Jonah . The others faded into the past , while the Son of Man gave forth new light . " " Does your word then take precedence over theirs ? " " Did you not hear the voice say : Listen to him ' ? " Their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been said that before the Son arrives Elijah shall come first ? " " He would not have been seen had he not already come , " Jesus replied . And they understood that he referred to John the Baptist , who had borne Elijah 's spirit in his flesh . There was a hush as John finished his recital , only Matthew 's scratching quill marring the silence . I found it important that the extent of his mission be defined . " If God is infinite , then is not the Son infinite as well ? " Jesus ' eyes held my own . " So long as he does God 's will . " " Then what is the full meaning of God 's removing the light from the prophets who were sent to free Israel ? " Jesus ' eyes moved slowly around the room . " God 's light is no longer for Israel alone . There is a new prophet and a new day . "  |p128SHE  DID NOT WONDER why we were there , but quietlyput forward flat cakes of barley bread , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , " she said in a voice as clear as a bell . " I know , for we come from Bethsaida . " " Yes , he stays with the sons of Jonah and their families . " She was completely without guile or artifice . She sat with her hands folded before her , her dark eyes looking out with tranquillityon the world . " You must be proud to be his mother , " I said rather lamely . " Does he send you to me ? " she inquired . " No , but I would know more about him . " " He has no secrets . " " It is about his birth , " said I in confusion . " Joseph of Arimathea has told me some things , but I would know more . "  |p129Her  eyes peered into mine , and I felt , for a moment , as though my very soul was bared . " As you will , " said she . " None can harm him except God be willing . " " I would defend him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me a mystifying smile , and I saw compassion in her eyes . " What is it you would know ? " " I can not understand why a husband would take a wife about to give birth on so arduous a journey . It is not what the midwives would prescribe . " " My husband had his reasons . " " But it was surely not for the census , since only adult males were commanded to enroll in the place of their birth . " Her eyes never left mine . " I went because God willed it . " " So that he could be born in Bethlehem ? " She nodded , and again I marveled at the dewy freshness of her countenance , so like a girl 's , so like a virgin 's , in fact . " He was born where it was intended he be born . " Could it be possible , in the realm of human affairs , that the mighty Caesar Augustus , ruler of the world , had issued his censusrakingorder as an unwitting , unbelieving instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a mind-boggling thought . " You knew then "  --  I hesitated  --  " whom you were carrying ? " I thought I detected an impish light in her eyes , but she replied with her wonted serenity . " Both Joseph and I knew , for we were given a vision through the angels of the Lord . " Never having had a vision myself , I questioned the visions of others . But Matthew was not so skeptical . Or else , like many chroniclers , he was unwilling to dig too deeply lest he spoil a good story . With soft words , he encouraged the mother to describe the vision however she remembered it . She smiled . " I Iow does one forget a visit from the Lord ? "  |p130It  had occurred in the evening , after she had put away the dishes . Joseph , to whom she was betrothed , was reading from the Psalms by the flickering light of a lamp . She suddenly felt a little drowsy and sat down to clear her head . At first she thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his lips moving as he read . So it was certainly no dream . The vision was in white , and there was a halo around its head . It looked like she had thought a vision should look , ethereal and pure , with a clear voice and a pristine authority almost divine in its regality . " Mary , daughter of David , " it said , " you are blessed among women , for you have found favor with God , and you shall bring forth a son who shall be called Joshua ( that shall become Jesus ) , meaning the savior of the Lord . He shall be called the Son of the Highest , and the Lord God shall prepare for him the throne of his father David . And he shall reign over the House of Jacob forever , and of his kingdom there shall be no limit , even unto the Gentiles shall he prevail . " She was no more than fourteen when she saw this spirit and was greatly troubled . For though she had been aware , with most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had not for a moment associated it with herself . She had inquired of the apparition ( for what else could it be ? ) : " How shall I be with child , when I have never known a man ? " " With God , " came the reply , " all things are possible . The Holy Spirit shall descend upon you , and you shall bear a son of God , just as Adam , before whom there was no other man , was conceived of the Holy Spirit . " Overwhelmed by her experience , she could only murmur : " Let God 's will prevail within me . I shall be proud to be the handmaiden of the Lord . " She was cautioned to tell none but Joseph and then only when it became necessary . He was much her senior , espousing her after the death of her parents so that he could take her into his mother 's home without causing idle tongues to wag . I had heard whispers that the older Joseph had married her only after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this saintly figure ,  |p131I  knew this to be false . Nevertheless , I needed to know more , to refute the attacks bound to come from the Temple . Matthew now deferred to my questioning . " Was Joseph then his real father ? " I asked . " He was all the father he knew from birth . " " Then he was not born like other men ? " " He has never been like other men . " She was amused by my clumsiness . " We were only betrothed at the time . But in accordance withsacred custom , he respected my virtue , for he was a kindly man . " I was so jarred at this thought that I barely heard Matthewinquire : " Was it not difficult for a simple man to place credence in a vision he had never encountered ? " " Joseph , " replied Mary , " was no ordinary man . But "  --  a shadow clouded her face  --  " it was only natural that he should question inc . " He had not chided her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid scandal . Her belongings had been gathered and she was to leave in the morning for the home of her kinswoman near Jerusalem . But that night , Joseph , too , had a vision in a dream . " Joseph , son of David , " the angel said , " fear not to take Mary , t he daughter of Abraham , as your wife . For that child which has been conceived is of the Holy Spirit . " On rising from his slumber , Joseph announced that they would be married and raise the child together . For he , too , was honored that God had chosen him for his design . At this time , though Mary knew it not , her kinswoman , Elizabeth , the wife of the priest Zacharias , was also with a child which appeared to have been conceived of God 's will , though not of God . For both were long beyond the age when people normally hoped for children . Indeed , Zacharias was so old that he would not even listen to the angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Temple altar , burning incense , " Mary recalled , " when the angel Gabriel appeared and announced to him that Elizabeth would give birth to a child who would prepare the people for another sent of God . "  |p132Zacharias  calmly turned his back on the angel and proceeded with his religious duties . How droll , but how typical for a priest to put his incense above the messenger of the Lord . " He had seen the angel of the Lord , " I said , laughing , " but was more impressed with his ritual . " " For his lack of faith , " she continued , " Zacharias was told he would be struck dumb until he recognized the truth . When he went to summon the people to their devotions , he found he could not speak . " But he still did not believe , for the day of visions , the Temple felt , had ceased with the Prophets of old . It was a dead God they worshipped . Taking Elizabeth , Zacharias returned to their country home outsideJericho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before her own child became noticeable , Mary yielded to an impulse to see her cousin . She found the house desolate . Zacharias , still mute , was moping about with a long face , and Elizabeth , who had so long thought herself barren , was too embarrassed to leave the house . Mary tried to lift the older woman 's spirits . " Take heart , " she said , " that you have been chosen by God to bring glad tidings to Israel . " Elizabeth was still depressed . " What would the Lord want of an old woman like me ? " " Have faith , " she replied , " for Zacharias ' affliction is itself evidenceof God 's hand . " She then confided her own secret . Elizabeth was more confused than ever . " How can all this be ? " she cried . Mary had meditated long over her situation . " God , " she had decided , " can conceive whatever he will , for neither heaven nor earth holds any secrets from him who is responsiblefor every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth felt a stirring in her own womb , and a voice told her she was filled with the Holy Spirit . In an ecstasy of belief , she accepted now what had been sop133troubling before . " Blessed are you among woman , " said she , kissingMary , " and blessed is the fruit of your womb . " Calmly she received her son 's own subordination to Mary 's unborn child . It was difficult , observing this angelic mother , not to be impressed . And yet , why would God look for his Messiah in the humble whose lineage was their only pride ? " God , " said Mary , " has a way of putting down the mighty from their seats of power and exalting those of low degree . He fills the hungry and barren with good things and sends the rich away empty . For , in the end , all inequity is resolved . " It seemed to me that if everything was God 's will there was little meaning in bending our efforts toward any goal . She smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties , which make us strong . We pray for courage and God gives us danger , which makes us aware . We ask for favors , and God gives us challenges , which make us grow . " Her eyes glowed with an inner radiance . " And blessed is the prophet who sees all this , and gives us hope . " Mary stayed with Elizabeth for three months , until the child was born . She had fondled it lovingly , knowing that this infant , six months senior to her own , would be his forerunner . The elderly couple had planned to call the boy Zacharias , meaning remembranceof the Lord , after the father , but Elizabeth suddenly insisted that he be called John . Zacharias ' relatives were dumfounded , since there were none by this name in their line . " Why , " they asked suspiciously , " would you name him John ? " She looked significantly at the mute Zacharias . " John signifies one who speaks for the Lord . " They asked Zacharias how he would name the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John . " And then he opened his mouth , and read the name after them , speaking for the first time in nine months . As his family marveled , Zacharias got down on his knees and asked God for forgiveness for not recognizing that he had been favored with a vision from the Lord . During the ceremony of circumcision , he held the baby in his arms . Although but eight days old , the infant appeared to look outp134on the world with wise old eyes . And he , the descendant of Aaron , who had denied the first vision now appeared to have another . For his eyes gleamed with a holy light and he peered off into the distance . " This child , " he said in a voice filled with emotion , " shall be called the Prophet of the Highest and shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his way . He will give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death will guide their feet into the way of peace . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat , childlike , her fair brow composed , it was hard to believe that all this had happened thirty years ago and more . Joseph was gone now , dead some ten years , and so were the others , but she lived on gloriously in the destiny of her son . " He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David , saying that we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all who hate us . That we should remember the promise he gave our father Abraham , that he would grant unto us one who would deliver us out of the hands of our enemies so that we might serve him without fear all the days of our life . " We regarded her silently , struck by the dignity with which she recalled God 's promise to Israel . " And is he the one ? " I asked finally . " That is for God to say . " " But how will we know unless he delivers us from our enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can say who that enemy is ? " " We have no enemy greater than Rome . All know there will be no peace in Israel while this enemy remains . " " Our worst enemy is within us . There is no peace outside us , unless first found inside . " The interview had gone on some time , and Matthew was concernedthat she might be tired . " I have so few visitors , " she said , " I am happy for this opportunity . " His birth still intrigued me , for it was coupled with so many of the prophecies from olden times.  |p135On  that day there had been many visitors : the three astrologers , with their frankincense and myrrh ; the simple shepherds who left their flocks to follow the star of Israel ; Joseph of Arimathea , still loyal to mother and child , and Anna , the toothless soothsayer . Were there any others ? I saw the secret sorrow in her eyes . Her voice trembled for a moment as she flew back over the years . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , but a simple man with a vision . " Matthew and I exchanged glances . It seemed odd that so many had visions concerning the birth . Did coming events indeed cast their shadow before them , so that the Lord 's wishes would be known ? She did not know what vision had come to Simeon , except that he murmured gratefully that he could die happy now that he had seen the Messiah promised of God . " Who was this Simeon ? " I wondered . She shook her head . " I knew him no more than I knew the seeress Anna or Joseph of Arimathea . " Yet she had not been surprised when the old man appeared and sank down on his knees before the newborn babe . She closed her eyes as she recalled that day in the manger . " He took the child from me in its swaddling clothes , and he looked to the heavens , saying in a voice full of fire : Behold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " Levi ( whom I must now call Matthew ) interposed : " And this sign , what was its nature ? " " The sign of the cross , which his disciples shall treasure until the advent of another age and his return . " I frowned . " What is this return you speak of ? " " Our time is short indeed , if he does not deliver us from the grave . " I could see from Matthew 's face that he was as puzzled as I was . " Was there anything more ? " he asked . Shc hesitated , then said with a tiny shiver : " Simeon said that a spear would pierce my own soul at the given time . "  | " Why the soul ? " I asked . " Spears and swords have no effect on things of the spirit . " She spoke with ineffable patience . " I gathered that it would he a soul-stirring event . " " And the nature of this event ? " " We must wait and see . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of tears in her eyes , and Matthew said gently : " You would prefer he was like any other ? " " I have learned to share him , which is as he wants . Andrew told him one day that his family was waiting . " Her laugh was like a bell . " He spoke up : Who are my mother and brothers ? Whoever does the work of the Father , that is my brother and sister and my mother . ' " " You did not mind ? " " I understood the point he made . For he was born , not for one family , but for all . " " He did not see you that day ? " " Oh , yes , he promptly came out , but he seizes on every situation to make a lesson of it , so men will better know God 's purpose . " " And in this case it was brotherly love ? " " That all who love God are his children . " She had put away a well-worn scroll as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned to one of its psalms . " May I read ? " she asked . Her voice was soft and melodious , like the call of the birds at daybreak . " I will make him my firstborn , higher than the kings of the earth . " My mercy will I keep for him for evermore , and my covenant shall stand fast with him . " His seed also will I make to endure forever , and his throne as the days of the heaven . " It was gratifying to see her pride . For she and Joseph had built their lives around Jesus , Mary because she believed in her vision , and Joseph because he believed in Mary . They fled to Egypt when Herod the Great 's search for the child extended from Judea intop137Galilee and were but a few hours ahead of Herod 's men when their boat sailed out of Joppa for Alexandria . They had friends in Alexandria , and living in the Jewish quarter was almost like being in Jerusalem . " We had our own temples , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dispersal were happy to see us , and all they could talk of was the Messiah . They had heard rumors that a new prince was born in Bethlehem who would one day deliver Israel from the alien yoke , and they were anxious for the day of liberation , so they could return to Israel free men . " It seemed odd that so many would prefer Egypt to their own land . " But was not Egypt under Roman rule as well ? " Matthew asked . She smiled . " Yes , but the Jews of Alexandria were transients with no sense of being Egyptian , and so it mattered little to them whether they paid their taxes to Rome or the Pharaohs . " In Alexandria , with a larger Jewish population than even Jerusalem , Jesus grew up almost as though he were in Israel . He was a prodigy , amazing not only his parents but the rabbinical community . At four he knew Hebrew , and by six , Greek and Latin . He spent his days poring over the Talmud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Songs of Solomon . Daily , he went to the famous Alexandrian library , which had assembled more books on history , philosophy , and the occult than all the libraries of the world combined . He enjoyed going by himself , and Mary indulged his whim , for he seemed mature and wise even then . Sometimes she would find him in earnest discourse with t he scholars and rabbis . " They would talk about the Messiah , " said she , " and he would nod gravely at their descriptions from the Prophets . " " None will know him when he comes , " she overheard him say once , " for a prophet has no honor in his own country , nor among his own people . " They regarded him respectfully as he explained . " They will all want something of him that he was not sent of God to bring . Thep138sick will demand to be healed , the poor will ask riches , and the rich would take their riches with them . " Even as a lad of eight he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be liberated from Rome and be freed of taxation . " " If the Messiah is not for the liberation of Israel , " said one scholar , " then we have been deceived all these years by Isaiah , Ezekiel , Zechariah , and Jeremiah . " His voice held just a trace of gentle irony . The boy was not in the least disconcerted . " Salvation for Israel lies not in things of this earth but in knowing the way to eternal life . " The Zealots scoffed at the idea of a Messiah who would not be another David or Saul . " How else can he ascend the throne of David , " observed the insurrectionary Abbas-bar-Hedekiah , " if he does not earn that distinctionagainst the enemy ? " The boy had smiled . " You see , even one who only speaks of the Prophets has no honor here . " They indulged him because he was young and because of the air of remoteness which gave him a strange sort of dignity . With their little games they tested his knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewishness . Mary had watched , bemused , as they flung their questions at him . " Tell us , " said another scholar , " what you know of the twelve tribes of Israel ? " Jesus ' blue eyes stared out at him ingenuously . " That which you know , sir , or that which you do n't know ? " " Name for me , sir , " the scholar mimicked , " the twelve sons of Jacob for whom the twelve tribes are named . " " They are named , " the boy replied , " not for the twelve sons , but for the ten sons , and the two grandsons , Ephraim and Manasseh , who were the sons of Joseph , who was sold off by his brothers into slavery but became great in the land of Egypt . " The scholar 's eyebrows arched in pleasurable surprise . " And the ten others ? " " Reuben , Simeon , Judah "  --  looking at his mother , who was ofp139the Judean tribe of David  --  " Zebulon , Issachar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And what of Levi , the twelfth son , what tribe did he give birth to ? " " His was the thirteenth tribe of Israel , " came the prompt reply , " but since all the land had been allotted , and the Levites had no portion of their own , certain cities supported their religious functions , and later they became Temple servants . " All , save the dour Abbas-bar-Hedekiah , clapped their hands in pleasure . He looked at the boy askance . " Ask this prodigy what he knows about the division of Israel , and when it will be one again . " The boy turned the thrust with a smile . " In the days of Rehoboam , the son of Solomon , ten tribes broke away and formed the Northern Kingdom , which was called Israel . And the Southern Kingdom , Benjamin and Judah , with Jerusalem as its capital , became known as Judah . " Bar-Hedekiah scowled . " Any schoolboy would know that . But tell me , my young genius , when God will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyranny and taxation ? " The boy rose from the floor , where he had been sitting with his legs crossed . " When that people , sir , is united with its God . " The discussion invariably got on to the Messiah , for nearly all agreed this was Israel 's sole hope . " When , " asked bar-Hedekiah , " can we look for the Messiah ? " " When God wills it , " came the prompt reply . " And when may that be , 0 enlightened one ? " " Look into your own heart and that of your neighbors . " " Mere platitudes . For the Prophets have given us many signs to look for . " " We have no need to look outside ourselves . " Bar-Hedekiah was no mean adversary . " Isaiah , " he said , " provides a time for the glorious coming of the Lord : Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened , and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped . ' " " True , " said the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a sign of his coining. "  |p140Occasionally  , there were visitors . Joseph of Arimathea came , as did Simeon , and they spent virtually all their free time with the parents and the boy . Joseph , who had business in Alexandria , tarriedfor weeks and would take the boy on tours of the city , into the native quarters , and even to the palace of a Roman tribune , an official he had bribed many times in a business way . The tribune , L. Pontius Aquilinus , was well thought of in Rome for leading a legion successfully against the Germans . Aquilinus was much bemused by the boy . " I have a son but a few years older , " he said with a sigh , " but my service for the Empire , alas , keeps me apart from my family . " " What is the boy named ? " asked Joseph out of politeness . " Pontius Pilate , " said the tribune . " An ambitious boy , he hopefullywill follow in my footsteps . " The name had meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past may well have accounted for Joseph of Arimathea 's ready access to the son . Joseph of Arimathea held many conversations with the mother . " I will send word , " said he , " when it is safe to return . " He had been as good as his word , promptly notifying them when Archelaus , Herod 's son , who shared his father 's fear of the prophesied successor , no longer ruled the tetrarchate . And so in the declining years of Caesar Augustus they returned quietly to their homeland , settling again in Galilee rather than Judah , where the boy 's precocity might not stir unwanted attention . They lived simply in a one-story limestone house with a thatched roof , shaded by cypress trees , where the boy would sit and read . He did not mingle with the children , choosing rather to converse with adults . As we looked now , following her eye , she pointed out a window to a tree-shaded bench . " He would sit there for hours , " she said , " reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no secrets for him . " I was startled for the moment . " You mean this was the house he grew up in ? " She nodded . " Until he departed for Bethabara . " Looking around at the simple chairs and tables , I thrilled at thep141realization that they had been fashioned by him . They were solid and well put together . " Could I see his room ? " I asked . Quietly she led us down a dark hall to a corner room . The room was small but bright , and a pitcher stood on a slight wooden table next to the narrow bed . There were three watercolors , unframed , on the walls . One was of Mary , another of a shepherd with his sheep . And the third , holding my eye , a nimbus of dark clouds through which shone a piercing light , appearing to expand from the parchment itself . We looked at her inquiringly . " Yes , he painted them . " " This light , " I said , " I have never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of it , but I knew it must have been born of a vision . " " There is no angel 's figure in it , " I said . An indefinable tenderness softened her face . " It was no angel he saw . " Life had been peaceful ; they lived on the outskirts of the village and had few visitors . Since there was no synagogue in Nazareth , they occasionally traveled to nearby Magdala or Capernaum for the Sabbath services , but more often they conducted their worship at home . It was not necessary to school him , since he had a greater command of the Talmud and the Torah than any scholar they knew , and was even versed in the mysteries of the Kabala , which he had studied in Alexandria . He had an abiding curiosity about Jerusalem and the Temple , but they waited till it was time for the traditional consecration of the adolescent before they satisfied this curiosity . And so he was twelve before they traveled again , journeying with other pilgrims to Jerusalem for the Passover celebration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And since there were no inns available , they camped with thousands of others on the slopes of the Mount of Olives , each day descending into the Temple for the sacrifices of the sacred lambs in the Court of Priests . It had not been an altogether reassuring experience . Jesus had not understood why his mother could not sit with him and Josephp142during the services commemorating the exodus of the Jews from bondage in Egypt . " Why is it , sir ? " he asked of Joseph . " Are not women the equal of men ? " Though the boy never called him Father , they were close , and Jesus showed him all the honor decreed in the decalogue . " They are different , " Joseph answered . " That does not make them less . " " It is a custom from Abraham 's time . " Joseph shrugged , taking recourse in tradition . " Men and women should not be kept from one another , " said the boy , " in this communion with their God . " They later moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacrificial lambs were led to the slaughter , the blood splashing over the basins onto the Levites and the multitude . He was grateful then that his mother was not permitted in this court as well . Joseph saw then that the boy was troubled . " What is wrong , Joshua ? " " Does it please God that these animals be butchered in his name ? " Joseph threw up his hands . " This is the religion of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , all of whom sacrificed living animals in their devotion to Jehovah . It is not for us to change these things . " Mary had been more sympathetic . " He thinks of God as one who loves all that he has put on this earth . Is that so strange , Joseph ? " Joseph shook his head . " I worry not so much about the world , but about him . It will be like butting his head against a wall of the Temple . I leave it to you which shall give way first . " His being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that he could not be anything but different . She watched proudly , as , months ahead of the customary time , he was consecrated into manhood . The pilgrims from Nazareth crowded about and congratulatedher on his accomplishment . He was no longer a boy but a citizen of Israel , always subject to the Romans of course . It had been an exhilarating Passover for them all . And it wasp143with an air of satisfaction , despite their fatigue , that they rounded up their party of pilgrims for the journey back to Nazareth . But thinking he rode with friends , they were on the road for a time before they missed him . They inquired about anxiously , but none could remember seeing him after they left the Temple . Joseph thought hard . " He must surely have gone back to camp with us . " But a precocious girl of twelve , who had eyes for the aloof young man , said she had last seen him in the Court of Gentiles with a group of rabbis and scholars . Joseph and Mary went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nearing the Temple , they overheard the people talking about a boy who was engaging the greatest scholar of Israel in a duel of wits in the Portico of Solomon . Anxiously , they threaded their way through the Court of Gentiles , and there they saw the boy and a bearded man in rich robes conversing solemnly . The crowd stood at a respectful distance , for it was seldom that the great Gamaliel chose to mingle with the people . With wonder , not unmixed with apprehension , the parents heard the boy stand up boldly to the Nasi of Israel . " Why , Rabbi , " he asked , " should Jehovah be so wroth with the people of Israel ? " " Because they are sinners and break the commandments . " " But is he not our creator , and our Father who created us in his own image of infinite goodness ? " Gamaliel looked at him warily . " Say what you mean , young man , and lay no snares for me . " Jesus had observed Mary and Joseph at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , Joseph , more just than God and more merciful ? " " Of course not , " snapped Gamaliel . " Is this another of your tricks ? " " But my father , Joseph , is always patient with me and never scolds , not even when he is displeased with me . " " That is admirable of him , " said Gamaliel , " but what has that to do with the one God ? " " He is our Heavenly Father , is that not true ? Now as the creatorp144and Father of all , understanding what he has created , with all its frailties , should he not be at least as merciful as my earthly father , who is after all only his creation as well ? " The crowd applauded enthusiastically , and even the Reb Gamaliel , who liked a worthy opponent as well as any man , clapped the boy on the shoulder . " You have made a point , but you forget one thing . God speaks through the Prophets , and none dares question what Isaiah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wrathful God speak of his stiff-necked people ? Speak you with more authority than Isaiah ? " The boy returned his gaze evenly . " My Father 's business is not to punish sinners but to redeem the righteous . " It was evident from Gamaliel 's manner that he was enjoying the debate . " What more is there , pray , about your Heavenly Father ? " " He would not be pleased that a drunken Gentile was stoned to death because in his drunkenness he wandered from the Court of Gentiles into the Court of Israel . " " But that is forbidden all who are not Jews , and the warning signs are plainly posted . " " But it was evident that he was intoxicated . " " The laws must be enforced , young man , or soon there will be no laws , and no Jewish people . " The boy frowned . " It is not even a question of mercy , " he said , " for does it not follow that the God who created all the universe created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they worship only him , are his Chosen People . So he told Moses and the other prophets . " Jesus smiled with such radiance that the whole assembly appeared to be illuminated . " But did not Isaiah say that he would send a Messiah who would be not only a light to Israel but a light to the Gentiles as well ? " Gamaliel stepped back and looked at him with widening eyes . " Who are you ? " he finally asked . " And who are your parents ? " Mary and Joseph came forward quickly . When Joseph soughtto make some apology , Mary gently interrupted . " We are of thep145House of David , sir , and believe in the law and the Prophets , as does our son . He is a good boy . " Gamaliel gave them a shrewd glance . " You do well not to apologize . Israel will hear more of this boy one day , of that I am sure . " Jesus regarded him calmly . " I go now with my parents . But we shall talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " I marveled now how the paths of these two had crossed , and remembered with a start how Gamaliel had mused over the name . " Gamaliel is no man to have for an enemy , " I said . Instantly I regretted my remark , for her eyes grew sad . " He has no friends , " she said , " but his Father . "  |p146ONLY  I BELIEVE HE IS GOD and can do whatever he will . Simon Zelotes protested : " But he speaks of God as his father . Is not the son less than the father ? " " The son is the father , and the father the son . Did not John , when he came down with Peter from the mountain , say they had heard in the whispering of the wind : Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee . Ask of me , and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession . ' " Simon looked doubtful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a psalm ' when it is of the spirit , and no man knows whence it comes ? " " Only God 's will is sure . " " But this is God 's will , a voice heard by all when there is nop147human source . What matters is that Jesus believes he is being guided . For does not the psalm say : Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron . Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter 's vessel ' ? " Simon now seemed to waver . " He seems more a prince of peace than of action . Now the Baptist was another matter . He was indeed a Maccabean . " There was a shadow of regret in his voice . " We are God 's people , " I pointed out . " Since we worship him alone , we alone are his people . And so there can be no rebellion without his approval . " Simon shook his head sadly . " The Maccabean found God in a good right arm . " To be perfectly honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged before . " The Romans are not the Syrians , even with all their weaknesses . We need Jesus . For none seeing his miracles can question his God-given powers . " Simon was a soldier and could be forgiven for not following the bread of my reasoning . " Judah , " he said ruefully , " he may be a God in heaven , but on earth he is very much a man . I have seen him tired and discouraged . He even wept , I understand , when his father , Joseph , died . Why if the dead are reborn should he feel any sorrow ? " " It is like being parted from a friend , nothing more . Did you not feel bad at leaving wife and child to be with the Master ? " I had made an unfortunate analogy . " I wonder sometimes whether it was worth it . " He sighed . " He knows what the disciples say of him . I read a psalm to himfrom the sacred scroll only last night , and he thought we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Action , Judah , not words . " " Words are weapons as well , and sometimes slice deeper than a sword . " ' Be wise now therefore , 0 ye kings . Be instructed , ye judges of the earth . Serve the Lord with fear , and rejoice with trembling . " Kiss the Son , lest he be angry , and ye perish from the way , when his wrath is kindled but a little . Blessed are all they that put their trust in him . ' ' ' Simon listened good-naturedly . " I hope you are right , it wouldp148simplify matters . But meanwhlie I meet with Joshua-bar-Abbas , Cestus , and Dysmas in regard to arming the Idumeans and the Syrian Jews . I leave the disputatious sons of Israel to you . They are too much for a Galilean like myself . " " But not for our Galilean . " Whenever it became uncomfortable , as when the Baptist was arrested and flung into Herod 's dungeon , we could be sure that we would soon be on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he would say , " there are still souls to be harvested . " And so we moved from Engedi , in Baptist country , to Jerusalem , Galilee , even Samaria , camping out at night in caves or on the wooded slopes , taking our food from the fields , or purchasing what we needed from day to day , taking alms only when we stopped overnight in homes open to our prayers . It had been raining all day outside the Holy City . Soaked to the skin as I was , surveying the motley group , I felt depressed for the moment at the thought of the tremendous obstacles that lay in the path of our undertaking . I looked around the campfire morosely . I saw little help from the Apostles . They had been picked chiefly because they were Galileansand were trusted as familiar things are . There was a saying that Galileans loved honor more than money . But , actually , there was little temptation to riches in Galilee , and so they deserved no credit . Yet they were a rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as we know , had demonstrated bravely , if blindly , against the viaduct , though it was not properly their concern . From the start it had been necessary to stress the Master 's Judean heritage . He had lived outside the mainstream of Jewish life , so that he could lose himself in the Talmud and Torah , until God gave him the word . The Pharisees questioned his humble beginnings and Nicodemus replied : " Does our law judge any man before it hears him out , and knows what he does . I tell you he is a prophet . " They laughed as much as they dared . For Nicodemus was so rich that he could feed the entire population of Israel for ten days if he wanted . " Search all you want , " they still scoffed , " for out ofp149Galilee arises no prophet . Does not the Scripture say that the Messiahcomes of the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem where David was ? " Fortunately , we had records of Jesus ' birth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident . For the Pharisees , too , had researched the Nazarene 's life . Indeed , they saw a plot by a simple carpenter and his obscure bride to ensnare the nation with a fairy tale . But to what purpose ? They well knew the prophet Micah . " But thou , Bethlehem Ephratah , though thou be little among the thousands of Judah , yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel ; whose goings forth have been from of old , from everlasting . " And whereas Bethlehem meant the house of bread , Ephratah signified rich in fruit , symbolized by the golden clusters of grapes which hung over the Temple gates as a reminder of Israel 's abundantfuture . The Pharisees had looked into his family but for Mary , who saw only us , and talked to Jude , James , Simon , and Joseph . They were plain working people and bore no resemblance to the Master . As I had been told , they were brethren , but not brothers , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed very much like the Galileans in his fold , the fishermen and fish dryers , the carpenters and cabinetmakers , the boat makers . Of the Apostles Andrew impressed me , for even Simon Zelotes was a changeable fellow , who felt at times we could overthrow Rome with arms alone . Andrew , the first chosen , was fair and shin with a ready smile . He stood as a buffer for the Master , turningaside the others ' petty complaints . He had influence over all but peter , who was a year younger but who , in his forwardness , behavedas if he were the older . They were the eldest among the disciples , only two or three years younger than the Master . Nearly all the others were of my age , twenty-eight , save for the beardless John . He represented the coming to manhood of Israel , so said the Master , who loved him because he saw himself in John 's youth and innocence . The other son of Zebedee , Jacob , whom Jesus called Junes , was quiet and serious-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alpheus the boat maker had their namesp150changed , from Jacob to James , called the Less because of his stature , and from Judah to Jude , to distinguish him from me . Jesus said a new baptismal name accented the individual 's rebirth particularly when this name had a meaning of its own . After Bethabara , Jesus himself was called the Messiah or the Christ , in the Greek style , more often than not . Jude meant Praised of the Lord , and Matthew , for Levi the Publican , signified a gift of the Lord , which he surely received when he was wrested from his evil ways . In renaming Philip , Jesus had smiled and said : " I like better the word loving , " for this Philip signified . Nathaniel was a sign of the Lord 's praise . A Syrian-Greek Jew by origin , he was sometimes referred to as bar-Tholomew , the son of Ptolemy , or Tholomew . He was an amiable sort , but undistinguished like the rest . The Master , as always , set the example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joshua . We all were struck by this , for there was a design to everything he did . In permitting himself a Greek name , he was obviously making a declaration to the Gentiles . It was as if he were saying to all , and not to the Jews alone : " I am Jesus Christ , the Savior and Deliverer , the Anointed , the eternal Son of God . " For in the Greek , this name meant all these things . As for my own name , he added to it my ancestral home in Kerioth or Carioth , but gave it a connotation that could be misconstrued . Judas Iskerioth , or in the Greek style , Iscariot , he had called me . " A name , " he said , " that will live always with mine . " I was flattered , but liked not the abbreviation SKR , almost an anagram , which stood in our language as a symbol for the betrayer . He put me off with a smile . " You have not chosen me . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this would Peter have gained precedence ? He was hardly the rock that his new name suggested . He seemed so gullible , so slow to grasp the obvious . Once he suggested I make an accounting to the Twelve . " I answer only to the Master , " I replied stiffly . " But , " said he , " the Master accepts whatever you tell him . " " And what am I to think from that ? "  |p151A  look of embarrassment made his fisherman 's face even redder than before . " There are reports , " he spluttered , " of money being diverted to weapons . " We had received a number of secret benefactions from the rich , such as Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea . " You are the rock , " I said , " and I the treasurer . When you give me the rock , I will give you the treasury . " He did not even know what I meant . Because of Peter 's insecurity , the Master felt it necessary to keep reassuring him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of Zebedee , a better adjutant , since they were well organized and practical . Peter was too easily confused . But the Master obviously saw in him some quality I did n't . It may have been Peter 's humility , but how else could he be but humble ? The Master did not make a move for himself . Peter fetched his food and wine , washed and mended his clothes , and constantly hovered over him . He made a good butler , if nothing else . He did n't seem to understand anything . " Every good tree , " the Master said once , " brings forth good fruit , but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit . Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them . " " What fruit , Master , is the good fruit ? " All of course understood the parable , all but the Rock . The Master indulged him always . He put his arm around those hulking shoulders and said : " Whoever listens to the son is a wise man , who builds his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winds will come , but the house will stand on this Rock . " Jesus never did anything without a reason . He was no gentle , easygoing creature floating along with the tide . Nothing happened without his knowing about it and accepting it . His every move was intended to establish a point or to impress us with the nature of his world . He was especially concerned with directing our activities , for he counted on his Apostles and disciples to spread his word . " Salvation lies with the Jews , " he enjoined , " and as Jews you shall bring this salvation to every household . Go forth as lambs among wolves . Carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes . "  |p152Some  of the seventy showed their bewilderment . They had left their homes , their families , their work , and he sent them out with only a cloth on their backs to knock on strange doors . Although I guarded the purse strings well , I felt it wise to spare these missionaries a few pennies so they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He cared less for money than anybody . Yet he stayed my hand . " The Lord will provide , " said he . " But , " I remonstrated , " if the householder shuts his door on them , where will they abide ? " " The door to heaven , Judah , is surely harder to enter than the home of the haughtiest Pharisee . " " But would it not be easier , Master , if they were better equipped for their mission ? " " Like troops separated from their baggage , they have nothing to consider but the battle . " " But they are novices and have not studied at your feet as we . " " Judas , Judas , " he said , half mocking , " you would lead troops against Rome , and you concern yourself with trifles . " " My soldiers would be armed , " I rejoined . " And so , too , are they armed , with the weapons of the Lord . For they shall heal wherever they go with the faith I send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I had made disciples . " Cestusand Dysmas , " said he with a grave face , " you shall be inseparableto the end . " He coupled dull , heavy-witted Simon-bar-Jonah with the bright new disciple John Mark , James with his brother John , Bartholomewwith Philip , Jude with his brother James the Less , and careful Thomas with amiable Andrew . " You , Judah , should feel at one with Simon the Zealot . " I could not have asked for better . While dining , I sat at his right , Peter at his left , next to his heart . I was not blind to this honor , but then I was the only Judean , besides himself , the only aristocrat , and save for Matthew , who had learned to write in confiscating the property of the oppressed , the only one with formal education . Young John had been schooled byp153Jesus and , like Matthew , was forever scribbling , the Lord only knows what . He constantly encouraged us . " You are instruments of God , " he stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You , John , and you , Matthew , shall one day send your message to the far corners of the earth . You , Peter , shall build a church that shall never die . You , James , experienced with me the transfiguration . You , Thomas , shall confirm my triumph , and you , Judah "  --  my heart stood still  --  " shall be my vehicle on the road to life everlasting . " The seventy were even more undistinguished than the Twelve . They were a scrubby-looking lot , with shaggy heads and beards , unwashed and disheveled from days on the highways . Though many were named by the Twelve , all were confirmed by him . But they appeared no more qualified for their missions after their baptismsthan before . But , as I soon saw , he was sending out a fox to catch a fox . " How , " asked a bedraggled Amharetz , " does a shopkeeper like myself , a poor seller of hides , heal anybody of an illness ? I am no physician . " Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so like those he would help . " You will heal in my name , with faith in the Father . I send you in pairs , not for companionship , but because if two agree on what shall be asked , it shall be done by my Father . And where two or three are gathered in my name , there am I in the midst of them . " He bade them take heart from what he wrought . " As I do , so you all can do with love of the Father , " he would say with each leper or lunatic he cured with a touch of his hand and a few simple words . But we all knew he was of different stuff . For though we sat at his feet and ate and drank with him , there was a gulf , never quite defined , but which could be likened to that between master and servant . He was removed , not so much by virtue of his manner as by our feeling that he was so much greater than any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . None , not even Peter or John , addressed him as anything but Master . For this reason ,  |p154though  there was a great curiosity about him , very little was known by the multitude . For even as he performed his miracles , he had instructed us to tell no man about his origin and his mission except as it unfolded of itself . He tried to make each of us think we were different , relating to different qualities in people even though our work was the same . " Theoretically , " said he , " you represent the twelve tribes , and the twelve types represented in astrology by the zodiac . " " Do you recommend this idolatrous worship of the Babylonians ? " I asked in some surprise . " Only as it reflects God 's order in the universe and its relation to people . " " But is this not a pagan belief ? " " Know you not the Psalms , Judah ? Surely , even a backslid Pharisee has this knowledge . " His eyes lifted reverently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , and the firmament shows his handiwork . Day after day , it speaks , and night after night , it shows knowledge . There is no speech nor language where its voice is not heard . " " Is this why we carry the sign of the fish ? " " The stars heralded the birth of the Son of Man , and they shall proclaim his death . " The other disciples now crowded about . " But , Master , you say there is no death . " " Death , Judah , is a friend well met on the way to a pasture far greener than any you have known . " While the disciples fanned out over the land , the main body of the Apostles remained with him . With the Baptist 's incarceration he had become increasingly cautious . On the way north from Judea , he directed that we skirt the larger communities and proceedby side roads through Samaria , which pilgrims ordinarily avoided in journeying to and from Jerusalem . As a Galilean , Simon-bar-Jonah knew the lot of pilgrims passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews . " But , Master , these evil Samaritans take pleasure in taunting and stoning the faithful bound for the Holy City . They even mockp155them with huge bonfires in the night so that they will think it dawn and rise and get on their way . Would it not be simpler to pass east of the Jordan through Perea and the Decapolis , and cross by the Galilean Sea into Capernaum ? " " Simpler , perhaps , but not as fruitful . When I see the Samaritan temple at Mount Geritzim , I am minded of the shallowness of these great churches which man builds for man . For God , not having man 's conceit , is satisfied with his own sky and meadow . Yet the Samaritans , ejected from the Temple by the Israelites , seek to outdo them in the same fashion . " When we still hoped to bypass this benighted people , he gave us a parable with which he had confounded a quibbler of low estate , a lawyer of Philadelphia , in the Decapolis . Some robbers , he pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him for dead in the street . His plight had been ignored first by a Temple priest , then by a Levite , both crossing to the other side of the road . But then a Samaritan came along and bound up the stranger 's wounds , and brought him to an inn and had him cared for , even to paying the bill . " Which of the three , " the Master asked , " was a good neighbor to this hapless victim ? " As though on cue , Simon-bar-Jonah blared out , " Why , the good Samaritan of course . " Simon-bar-Jonah showed , as usual , how pious he was . " Lord , " said he , " if my brother sins against me , shall I forgive him seven times ? " " I say forgive not seven times , but seventy times seven . " Matthew had looked up at this . " And if we do not forgive , Master ? " " It will not go well then . For if you forgive men their trespasses , your Heavenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your tres-passes . " It was easier said than done . From Jerusalem we took the hill road at night to escape the heat of May . In the afternoon we gratefully felt the soft wind by which Boaz winnowed his barley , and by evening we came to Sychar ,  |p156sto|p|ping  by the well which the patriarch Jacob had dedicated to his son Joseph . Since we proceeded north , away from Jerusalem , the Samaritans did not molest us . Their fight actually was more with the hierarchy than the people . It was an ancient grudge . They had been barred from the Temple when their ancestors committed the sacrilege of casting two huge golden calves as the Lord Jehovah . In reprisal thereafter , they had stolen into the Temple and shamefully flung human offal into the Sanctuary . The feud persistedand no Temple-going Jew would abide in Samaria overnight , particularly at the well where Jesus had us camp . " The water of Samaria , " said the rabbis , " is more unclean than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scruples about dealing with the Samaritans , or with anybody who expressed interest in his Kingdom of Heaven . " My Father , " he said , smiling , " can cleanse even the blood of the Pharisees . " And so , after we made camp by this shrine of Joseph , the Master sent us into the village for provisions and reclined by the well to meditate . On our return we saw him talking to a woman who held a waterpot in her hand . As I came close I could overhear the conversation . " How is it that you , a Judean , ask water of me , when the Judeanshave no dealings with Samaritans ? " The Master shook his head . " There is neither Israelite nor Samaritan , Galilean nor Roman . All are children of God and may drink of the living water . " She gave him a puzzled frown . " What now is he up to ? " whispered Simon Zelotes in my ear . " It is always the same , " I whispered back , " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Master silenced us with a glance . He gave the woman the quizzical look I knew so well . " Whosoever drinks of the water I give him shall never thirst again . " With some trepidation she offered him the waterpot , and he sipped from it slowly . She looked at him intently , hypnotized , as so many were , by his magnetism . " Sir , give me this water that I thirst not . "  |p157I  had seen women melt under his glance before . Nevertheless , I was baffled by the encounter , the reason for it not yet being clear . His eyes moved over her and found her comely , in the impersonalway he had with women . " Your name is Deborah , " he said finally . Her chin dropped in consternation . " How know you my name , when I have never seen you before ? " He still regarded her speculatively . " Go fetch your husband , and bring him here . " She hesitated for a moment . " I have no husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , for you have had five husbands . Yet lie with whom you now live is not your husband . " Her eyes almost dropped out of her head . " How do you know this ? " she cried . He seemed to be toying with her . " You have no children , and for this reason keep remarrying . " Her dull Samaritan eyes widened . " How know you this ? " she asked again , as if the Master had divulged something of importance . He brushed aside her question . " This last , with whom you live , does not marry you because of his position in the community . " She let out a deep breath . " You are indeed a wizard . " For the life of me , I could not understand why the Master had stooped to such fortune-telling . Who cared whether this scrawny wench had married a hundred times ? Of what moment was it to any but herself ? " Why do you tell me all this ? " she asked . " So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I perceive , " said she , still shaken , " that you are a prophet , sent with the living water . " " God is the living water , and who worships him must worship in spirit and truth . " It was now apparent to the Apostles for whom these words were intended . The woman 's eyes showed her wonder as she considered the miraculous stranger.  | " I know that the Messiah of the Jews comes soon . And he will clear up all things , they say . " His eyes fell for a moment on the Twelve , and he said in a ringing voice : " I that speak to you am he . " She kneeled in her joy , but he raised her up with a gentle smile . " You are twice blessed , who is a Samaritan and yet believes . " She kissed his hand devoutly and hurried off , forgetting her waterpot . In the afternoon she returned with a company of Samaritans . They immediately surrounded the Master . The leader was a shepherd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Jew . " This is the headman of the village , " said the woman Deborah . " I told him of your wonders . " " You still have not married him , " said the Master with a smile . As always , he picked out the relationships of people with a glance . There were no secrets from him , not of this life , in any event . The Samaritans bowed low before the Master , their heads almost scraping his feet . They bore gifts of costly frankincense and myrrh , as if paying homage to a King . I quickly stepped forward , to accept the offerings . But the Master stayed me with a frown . They also brought gifts of food , but he turned these away with a smile . " I have food you know nothing about , to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work . " He spoke slowly , almost as if to himself . " The Son of Man dies for you . So be not afraid when they seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be able to destroy the body , they have no more power ever after over you . Rejoice in the constant presence of the Father , who has the power to deliver you from all judgment . The sparrows cost but a few pennies , yet the Lord , who is the source of all life , marks the flight of the smallest bird . How can you fear trifles when the very hairs of your head are numbered ? God watches over you , for you are of more account to him than the sparrows . " I came into this life to reveal the Father and to lead you to him . The first I have done of my own , but the last I can not do withoutp159your assent . The Father compels no man to enter his kingdom . But why should Jew or Gentile hesitate to accept the glad tidings that he is eternally a son of the eternal God ? Tarry not in the valley of decision , but come and partake of the water of life . " These Samaritans , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , kneeling , they were baptized by the disciples , for Jesus still did not baptize , saying again that he would not take from the Baptist this distinction of being the greatest dwelling on earth to prepare the way . " I dwell in the Father , and he dwells in me . And he who dwells in me , also dwells with the Father . " The Samaritans marveled at the intimate way he spoke of God . " How can we best please the Lord God ? " asked the giant Amos . " By conducting yourself in such a way that you will become a worthy companion to him in heaven . " The Samaritans were much taken with this answer . " Please tarry with us , " they said , " for we know that you are no ordinary man , but indeed the Christ who will save the whole world . Why else would you , a Judean , trouble with Samaritans ? " We remained for two days , the Master telling his parables to ever increasing multitudes , while I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Amos , though simple , like our Peter , seemed to reflect the mood of his people . " Our fathers fought for and against the Romans , serving as mercenaries , and then again as patriots for Palestine . But with a leader like Jesus we could muster an army of brave men to do battle for the one God against the pagan Pilate . " " Would you not be afraid , " I asked , " to repeat the fate of Judah of Galilee ? " " It would not be the same , " he said confidently , " for that Galileanwas a false prophet . Neither did he come out of Bethlehem Ephratah , nor was he of a virgin born . " I was understandably puzzled . " Whence came your infor-mation ? " Hee pointed to Simon-bar-Jonah . " The big fisherman told me . " " He told you correct . " For once I agreed with the bumpkin.  |p160Jesus  never stayed long in any one place , fearful that the soldiers might seize him before he was ready , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I protested his easy assumption of his own early death . " Who will lead if you go ? " He smiled sadly . " You will know about my going before any of the others , Judah . Think well of what I say this day , but remember that no man taketh my life . I die to fulfill the ancient prophecy and show the world that life is everlasting . " If all was ordained , why then did we so frantically plot and strive ? " If we are merely instruments of the Lord , what matter who we are or what our ambitions ? " He smiled . " Without who and what we are , God 's will would not be done . " " But who would be served , Master , by your death ? " " Humanity . " It was all very baffling . " But you have cured many minds and bodies , and given a life of hope to many more . How better can you serve your people than by giving them the freedom you speak of ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , which is everlasting , and belongs to all . When only one nation is free , then others are less than free . " " But it is with Israel God made his covenant , and his promise of the Messiah . " " God makes his will known to his prophets at different times in different ways . There is nothing unalterable in God 's world , save for God . " " What then happens to the human will , Master ? Is it like a puppet , pulled by strings it does not see ? " The Master 's smile widened . " By the decisions in this lifetime , Judah , by the lessons we learn , even tardily , we establish our place in the Kingdom of Heaven . " " And why is this of greater moment than our life on this earth ? " Matthew , Peter , and John had walked into the camp and squatted down about the fire , rubbing their hands together . I felt a twinge that our moment of intimacy was so rudely ended.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Master said , " for I had thought to speak to you all on this subject , which is that what we do lives after us , and returns with us . " Matthew looked up inquiringly . " You speak then , Master , of being reborn . But in all of Israel none but the Pharisees believe in the angels of God and the rebirth of man . With the Sadducees the current experience is all , and yet they manage the Temple and worship of the Lord God . " " The Sadducees are completely Hellenized , " I put in , " and more like Stoics and Cynics than the Hellenized Romans . As for the Pharisees , they are so lost in ritual that they cast God in their own crabbed image . " " Well said , Judah , " observed the Master , as my heart sang with his praise . " But there are others in Israel besides the Sadducees and Pharisees . The Amharetzin , in their simplicity , are open to God 's teachings , and the Essenes teach that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with John the Baptist in the resurrection . None knows better than the Baptist that by the choices in this lifetime , by one 's virtue or lack of it , one establishes the conditions of this rebirth . But one must still die to be reborn . " His eyes became soft and reflective . " And this , too , the Baptist knows and must deal with . " His eyes held a haunted look I had not seen in them before . I sensed John 's quick concern , but the Master 's mood swiftly passed . And it was not until morning when the news came of the Baptist 's execution that we had reason to recall his prophetic words . One of the seventy disciples brought the word from Perea , where the Baptist had been imprisoned in the Machaerus dungeon . I lerod 's wife had demanded his execution as a price for her continuingaffections , but not till the Baptist 's followers stopped payingtheir taxes was his doom sealed . Herod was too much the fox to indulge the whim of Herodias or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . When told how the Baptist 's head was brought out on a silver platter by the ( lancing Salome , the Master groaned and motioned for the disciple to end his recital , saying : " He was a burning and a shining light , and the people were willing to rejoice in his light . Forp162of men born of woman there was no greater prophet than John . " As much as he grieved for the Baptist , he stressed that the messagewas of more import than the messenger . " I have a greater witness than the forerunner , for the works which the Father has given me to finish bear witness who sent me . " Few of us doubted his powers , only his mission . In a world of so many inequities , who knew which injustice had a priority ? Simon Zelotes and I saw clearly that with his charisma he could quickly muster legions enough to push Rome into the sea . Andrew , Peter , and James saw him as the true High Priest of Israel , superseding Annas and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasantsof Galilee , were impressed mainly that he healed the sick and gave to the indigent . Only Matthew and John seemed to seek the meaning of his heavenly salvation , but their concern seemed that of chroniclers , wishing to clarify and pass on what they witnessed . " The Sadducees , " said Matthew , " say the soul perishes with the body . There is no beyond , no place or rest or torment , no judgment , no separation of good from bad . No retribution in life or death . " " They believe in tithes , taxes , and money changers , " he replied with scorn . " Why would you heed them ? " Matthew 's brow puckered . " But the Pharisees believe in this afterlife you speak of , where there will be rewards and punishmentsas one behaves in this life . The virtuous will return , and the wicked be confined to prison . The Essenes hold that virtue shall survive after death in a model land beyond the sea . " " It is not as they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With repentance there are no sinners , and the Kingdom of Heaven is for all who would be reborn without sin . " Saint or sinner , what mattered heaven , without recognition of the more immediate problems on earth ? Like me , Simon the Zealot was anxious that Jesus declare the extent of his leadership . Was he not the bridegroom rather than a mere guest , and the wedding long overdue ? " You speak of being a light unto the Gentiles , yet the Rabbip163Eleazar , the great scholar , invokes the words of the Lord : Since you have recognized me as the sole God , I have recognized you as the only people . ' " Jesus smiled . " That is how it was until the present time . But with the advent of the Son , God through his Chosen People brings his light to all nations . " I could see my own impatience in Simon . " How can there be light without freedom ? " " The truth shall make you free , Simon . " " We be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any man , ' say the Pharisees . How say you , you shall be free ? " The Master smiled sadly . " Stay and see , Simon , stay and see . For you shall become free in a way you do not expect . " Not unlike ordinary mortals , his moods varied for no discernible reason . When we came to Caesarea , the capital for the Romans , he seemed more expansive than usual . We spread our robes on the sands for a midday meal overlooking the blue Mediterranean . The Master partook sparingly of a handful of grapes , some sour milk , and a flat cake of barley . I offered him a good wine from the vineyards of Galilee , but he shook his head with a smile . " I drink no wine , Judah , until the last time we sup together . " Shading his eyes , he looked off at the gleaming gold-domed palacebuilt in the Greek style by Herod , and said in a reflective tone : " There dwells the Procurator Pontius Pilate with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his overwhelming ambition that his fame shall rest through eternity on his meeting with the Son of Man . " " Would you then lead the Judeans against Rome ? " I asked with quickened breath . He gave me a pitying smile . " Judah , Judah . " " But you have said that you have come not to bring peace but to unsheath a sword . " " Ask better , Judah , whose sword it shall be . I am not of the Maccabeans , but of one whose work serves all mankind . You should all know by now who I am and who sent me , just as the lady at the well knew from our brief meeting . Is not that appoint/ment in Samaria of more moment than all the things you have witnessed ? " There was almost a railing note in his voice . " Or does one have to be a Samaritan to believe in the Son and the Father ? " He beckoned to John , who sat facing him , as was his wont , and to bar-Jonah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . " Tell me , dear John , who do men say I am ? " John 's gray eyes glowed with pleasure at being the first to be asked . He , of course , had heard all the stories spreading about the land , and with them the prophecy of Malachi . Had not Malachi said : " Behold , I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord . And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children , and the heart of the children to their fathers , lest I come and smite the earth with a curse . " John stood up in his enthusiasm . " Some declare , dear Lord , that you are Elijah , the prophet of good tidings , and others , Jeremiah , come again to smite your people with the truth , or one of the other prophets , such as Isaiah or Ezekiel , whom you constantly read from . " His rosy countenance clouded for a moment . " Some even say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , since you were baptized by him but a short time ago , and he has only recentlydied . Is it possible , Master , for his spirit to have merged with yours ? " The Master shook his head . " No , dear John , the spirit in man is but one , though joined with God it forms the soul eternal . " Nathaniel , who prided himself on being a student of the law , reacted with more than usual vigor . " Why then have the Scribes , as well as the Prophets , said that Elijah , who is long dead , must first come before the Messiah ? " The Master 's eyes passed from Matthew to me , as though we shared this little tidbit he was about to deliver . " That is well said , Nathaniel , for in truth it was necessary for Elijah to make the way ready , which he did . But the authorities knew him not , and so they did what they would with him . " Nathaniel 's normal placidity failed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptist was indeed Elijah , and that none recognized him ? "  | " Those who were ready knew him . " " But he came and left without accomplishing that promised of Elijah . " " He served his Father well , then went to his heavenly reward , just as the Son of Man shall suffer of the Philistines . " That by the Philistines the Master meant the unbelievers was apparent even to Philip and Nathaniel , who were indeed birds of a feather . Had not Nathaniel said on first hearing of Jesus : " What good can come out of Nazareth ? " The disciples had formed a close circle about the Master in their anxiety to resolve the identity of the leader they followed with secret qualms . Slowly his eyes traveled till they fell on the ruddy face of Simon the fisherman . " And who say you that I am ? " Simon-bar-Jonah 's eyes fell under the sardonic glance . He wet his lips nervously , then , lifting his eyes to heaven , said , as if coming to an inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For you are the Anointed , the Promised One of Israel , the Son of the Living God . " Jesus stepped forward and rested his hands on Peter 's broad shoulders in a rare demonstration of affection for any but John . " You are blessed , Simon-bar-Jonah , for this was revealed to you not by flesh and blood but through the divine inspiration of my Father in heaven . " I saw nothing earth-shattering in the fisherman 's remark . It was only what the Master had claimed on countless occasions . Yet Jesus took this opportunity , on the basis of Simon 's apparent revelation , to raise him formally now to the front rank of his followers . Until now , though he had called him the Rock , there was no distinction among the Apostles . As his deputies we were all equal unto each other and before the public . But with his hands still on Simon 's shoulders , Jesus conferred the prized accolade : " On this rock I will build my church , and the gates of hell shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Kingdom of Heaven , and whatsoever you do on earth shall be done as in heaven . " And so there it was , finally . First he had called him Peter thep166Rock , then he had sat him next to his heart , and now he made it clear what he had intended all along , using the flimsiest of reasons for doing so . But in truth it was only an empty honor , for other than adding to his sense of importance it served no purpose . Andrewstill was his secretary , I his treasurer , and John his favorite . And so why had he done it ? Perhaps Matthew , with his chronicler'seye , saw it more clearly than any of us . " Peter , " he said , " with all his human frailties , his hopes and aspirations , his good intentions gone sour , his doubts and fears , will in the end know best how to bring his message to the people . For there is a bit of everyman in him . " And so it might well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Simon Peter . For if one lived on and on , constantly coming back to complete the unfinished task , striving , as the Master said , to reach perfection in God 's image , then indeed it might be a prudent man who would mark his time against Romans , in this lifetime if not the next . But what proof was there ? It was not enough to say " Have faith , " for faith needed some small kernel of reality on which to grow . All the talk among the Pharisees and the Essenes of the afterlife was just talk so far as I could see . Jesus , too , spoke of the Kingdom of Heaven , and of rebirth , man 's needingto die to be reborn , but again they were words . Jesus was not entirely friendless in high places , nor among the Pharisees . For many of the Pharisees , particularly the rich and the elderly , were intrigued by the prospect of not only living on in this Kingdom of Heaven but also descending again onto earth . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly , not wishing their sympathies to be known , while others watched patiently to see which way the wind blew . To Nicodemus , one of the Pharisees intrigued by his teaching , Jesus made clear his belief in reincarnation . Nicodemus , a guiding light of the Great Sanhedrin , stole into our camp one night as I was making an accounting to the Master . He had been fretting over Jesus ' references to man reborn . He looked at me askance , but the Master quickly reassured him that he could speak plainly . " The least of my disciples is as great as I. " Nicodemus seemed embarrassed that a son of his old friendp167Simon should witness his appeals to a dedicated foe of the Pharisees . But he soon overcame his nervousness . " We know that you are from God , " he said , " for no man can perform your miracles except that God be with him . " Jesus knew what this visit must have cost the Pharisee . " You speak well , Nicodemus . But I tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kingdom of God . " Nicodemus ' reaction was the normal one . " How can a man be born when he is old ? Does he enter a second time into his mother 's womb ? " " Except a man be born of water and of the spirit , he can not enter into God 's kingdom . For that born of the flesh is flesh , and that born of the spirit is spirit . Only the spirit , Nicodemus , is born again , for the body is but the temple of the spirit . " Nicodemus ' long face was still troubled . " Does man return to his former estate ? " he asked . " Only if he is deserving before God , and then his estate is bound only by the sky . " Nicodemus hesitated , for he did not want to be thought greedy . " Was it not said of old that man is like the dust ? " " That was said of the body , not the spirit . Repent and be saved , for even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares for his neighbor as himself . " Nicodemus ' concern was still with the earth . " Do we have any choice as to what we become ? " I saw the flicker of a smile on the Master 's lips . " Let me say again , " said the Master , " that no man , unless he has already ascended from the earth , descends from heaven . Even the Son of Man must be lifted up so that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life . " Nicodemus at length departed satisfied , having found somewhere in what the Master said a definition of eternity that suited him . But Jesus ' constant allusion to his own death , however he lived on elsewhere in perpetuity , bothered all the disciples , but none more than me . For if he were to die prematurely , who would lead the insurrection ? His appeal was to all classes . Some considered him anotherp168David , the giant killer . Others were drawn by his healing powers , or by his promise of eternal life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spinning at any time . Whatever it was , there was the common desire to follow him . Nicodemus had eventually been so impressed that he impressed his son by merely telling him of the Master . Boaz came to me , and with a glad heart I took him to Jesus , for with the upper classes we recruited the flower of Jerusalem . The Master was in a garden , caressing the flowers and speaking tenderly to them , as if they were living creatures . He rose from his knees with a smile , offered me his cheek , and then gave Boaz his hand . Boaz affected a tone of great humility . " My father has told me of his conviction that you are truly a teacher come from God , and that you preach a doctrine of eternal life . How , Lord and Master , may I partake of this life ? " Jesus regarded him with his enigmatic smile . " How much do you desire this life ? " " With all my heart . " Boaz 's brown eyes kindled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would do anything you ask . " Jesus ' smile deepened . " You call me Lord and Master . Knowyou not there is only one Lord and Master , and that is the LordGod of Israel ? " " I meant no offense to the Holy One , " said Boaz , " only honor to his messenger . " " I come from him , " said Jesus , " but he exists apart from me , whereas I can not exist without him . " " Some call you the Son of God . " " The Son is not as great as the Father , though in time some will unwisely call me God . You are ready to do anything , you say ? " " Anything . " Boaz 's head bobbed eagerly . " You must keep the commandments . " " Is one more important than the other ? " " You shall worship the Lord God with all your heart . From this others will naturally follow . For then you can not lie or steal , and it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boaz 's eyes gleamed with pleasure . " I have kept all these corn/mandments from the time I was a boy . " " Have you a wife or a maiden you fancy ? " " I am unwed , and there is none I can not leave . " " And your occupation ? " " I have helped my father with his estates . " " And he has rewarded you well ? " " He has already given me my inheritance . " " It is considerable ? " " Yes , for I am his only son . " " Those who follow me have no family but the company of man . " Boaz nodded quickly . " I am ready . " Jesus paused . " Are you ready to dispose of the possessions given you by your earthly father ? " Boaz hesitated . " I do not take my property with me . " " You can not travel without taking all that you are with you . Give what you possess to the poor , then follow me , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doubt in Boaz 's eyes . " I can not give away that which is my birthright . " Jesus sighed . " Your inheritance shall be of this world alone . Only he that forsakes all for my name 's sake shall inherit everlastinglife . " With a downcast face , Boaz turned and trudged slowly away . " There is a lesson here , " said Jesus sadly , " for even those whohave thrown in with me . " His eyes looked through me . " Rome wasnot built in a day , neither shall it fall in a day . " I looked up eagerly . " Then it shall fall ? " " All shall come to pass as prophesied , and Rome shall be as a footstool of the Lord . "  |p170NOT  UNDERSTANDING MY PATRIOTISM , mostof the disciples considered me an unbeliever . But Jesus himself turned aside their barbs and let me know that he held me as good as the others . " You , Judah , have your mission like the rest , and will be rememberedlong after many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " is to free my people . " His eyebrows arched delicately . " Your people , Judah ? And , pray , who are they ? " " The Jews throughout Israel and the Diaspora who would be free of Rome . " " And the other people ? Are not the people of Rome , whom you despise , also the victims of this tyranny ? " He was forever complicating things.  | " Is it not clearly spoken by the Prophets that the Messiah shall deliver Israel , so that it shall triumph over the seventy nations ? " " So you would replace the Roman tyranny with another ? " " I care not about the others , " and then more boldly , " nor should the Messiah . " " Judah , Judah , " he reproved me gently , " how often must you be told that only God 's will is important . All else is vanity . " Even in his faded robe and worn sandals , he had the look of a King . And that he surely was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him . In the face of his indecision , the faith of the disciples , and the people , often flagged . Then he would perform some new wonder which made all realize that he was truly the Deliverer of Isaiah and the Son of Man . On the road from Jericho we passed through the Valley of Kedron , intending to enter the Holy City by the Fountain Gate . There was a goodly company at our backs when the Master turned toward the Siloam Pool , just southeast of the city . Normally , he avoided the shrines where the ailing gathered , for he healed publicly , with few exceptions , only to reveal his relationship to the Father . And so I had the feeling he was up to something again . Now , as he approached the pool , he was predictably mobbed by the sick waiting their turn in the water . Hearing the excited murmur of the crowd , a blind man raised his hands imploringly , crying out in a quaking voice : " Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to many who were not sure yet that he was the Promised One but who wanted not to offend him if he did prove himself the Deliverer . Others in the multitude , hoping themselves to be healed , called on Josiah-bar-Timaeus to hold his peace . But Jesus peered over their heads and bade Andrew bring the man forward . Josiah threw away his cup and prostrated himself before the Lord . " Son of David , " he cried , tears streaming from his sightless eyes , " my eyes would see the bright flowers and the blue skies , the beloved faces of my aging mother and father . For I have been blind from birth and have seen no man , nor in my mind can I fathomp172how I myself look , though my hands have gone over this countenanceendless times . " Peter had his usual question . " Who did sin , Master , this man or his parents , that he was born blind ? " This was not the first time Jesus had been asked to help somebodyborn blind , only the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their noses in disgust , for they believed in no life but the present . But the Master replied , without affirming or denying reincarnation : " Neither has this man sinned , nor his parents , that he should have been born thus , but that the works of God at the appointed time should be made manifestthrough him . " Since Josiah was now thirty years old , it seemed to me cruel that he should have gone sightless all these years just so the Master could use him as a sign . " Josiah-bar-Timaeus , " said the Master , as if divining my mind , " shall bear witness before all of the power of the Lord . " The light of the world was about to deliver light to the blind . I saw the sneers of the Sadducees and Pharisees and Scribes . They would see and still not believe , for to do so would overturn their comfortable world . Usually Jesus healed with a word or a touch . But now he spat on the ground , made a clay of the spittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blind man . Josiah stood as still as a post . " Do you feel , " said the Master , " that you will be cured ? " " I have no doubts , Son of David . " " Good , wash then in the pool , and be healed . " Andrew and Peter helped Josiah into the pool , empty now becauseall the sick had crowded about Jesus , praying to be next . Josiah kneeled and laved his eyes with the water . And then , rubbing his eyes , he let out a jubilant cry : " I see , I see . " In his excitement , he began jumping up and down , until I thought he might fall and do himself damage . But Andrew and Peter got him out of the pool , and took him to the Master . Jesus ' aura was strong that day , and his eyes piercing . " You were healed , Josiah-bar-Timaeus , because you had faith.  |p173All  the clay in the world , without faith , will not heal the bite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every sight , " I bear witness that I was blind all my years , until I was healed here today . " The Pharisee Ezra , self-styled the Truth Watcher , said coldly , out of the crowd : " And who bears witness to you ? " Josiah 's face clouded . " I know not what you mean . I have sat by the pool twenty years and none questioned my blindness . Why would I lie , sir ? " " You have a devil in you , and we know well who put it there . For this healing , if it is such , has been done on the Sabbath day , then there is a ban on public activity . " Jesus ' eyes flashed . " Ezra , if your ox fell into a pit and was suffocating , would you extricate him on the Sabbath ? " " The Sabbath is God 's , and it is blasphemous to work on this day . " " God is more merciful than the Pharisees . For he made the Sabbathfor man , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his lip , but the Master coolly turned away , followed , as usual , by the crowd . " What shall I do now ? " called Josiah , running after him . " Enjoy your sight , " said he , " and deny me to no man . " Two days later , as we camped on the Mount of Olives above the Garden of Gethsemane , word came that the Pharisees planned to put the blind man on trial and reveal Jesus as a charlatan . Somewhat troubled , I went to the Rabbi Gamaliel 's home in the afternoon . He was praying in the garden but looked up with pleasurewhen he saw me . " I am glad to see you , " said he , holding out his cheek , " not only for yourself but so that you can tell me more about this Galilean whom they whisper is the Messiah . " " He is the Messiah , " I said . " He fits the prophecies perfectly , except that he dallies about Rome . " " He is wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firebrands would have him on the same cross as Judah the Galilean. "  | " There is no cross that can hold him . He shall reign forever , for he fits all the requirements of the King of Kings . " " We have enough Kings , " said Gamaliel drily . He took me by the elbow . " But excuse me for being a negligent host . Let us go to the study , where we can sip of Persian wine and sit privately and talk . " He led me from the flowered atrium to a small room with windows overlooking the splendid palace of Caiaphas and the palaceof Herod . " You have fine neighbors , " I said . He smiled . " Your father 's house is but a short distance . " He coughed . " Which reminds me that your mother is back . I think you should call on her . " I looked up eagerly . " Did she ask after me ? " " No , but her coming back suggests that she would mend the wounds . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But she is my mother . " My sense of grievance asserted itself . He smiled . " Even so , does not your Master preach that to forgiveis to be forgiven ? " I looked at him closely . " You have been following him ? " His head inclined slowly . " Since he was twelve , it would appear . But go to your mother , promise me that . " I promised . We reclined comfortably , facing each other over a table laden with wines from many countries . " I would prefer a Judean wine , " I said . " Always the patriot , Judah ? Well , that is one request I can readilyfulfill . " He looked up slowly , the decanter poised over my cup . " Is there any other request ? " " Why , " I asked , " does the Sanhedrin concern itself with so slight a matter as a healing at a healing pool ? " He frowned . " It is not slight when you consider how sacred the Pharisees hold the Sabbath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was like restoring a life . " " According to the law he had no right on the Holy Sabbath even to pick a plum from a tree . " " But it was God 's work . "  | " The Temple decides what is God 's work , and "  --  his eyes twinkled  --  " the Sanhedrin decides the Temple 's work . " " Annas ' family runs the Temple , and the Sanhedrin . " I had spoken too quickly , and his red face reminded me soon enough of his position . He went on quickly before I could apologize . " The Sanhedrin is evenly divided between the Sadducees and the Pharisees , and they are not quick to do Annas ' bidding in all things . " " They have convened at his request to question the blind man and his parents . " He held out a long finger . " But they have not called your Jesus . " My curiosity was piqued . " And why is that ? " " Because he has friends even in the Sanhedrin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of David and would know more about him before they pass judgment . " My eyes studied that shrewd , jovial face . Not for naught did they call him the Owl . " And they fear the thousands that follow him like the Messiah , " I finished his thought . " Who would , if he gave the word , take over the Temple and the Fortress Antonia . " He chuckled in his beard . " He will never give the word , for he thinks too much of Israel . " I looked at him questioningly . " From all I hear he is a very wise man , and wise men know there is a time and place for everything . " There was no point in discussing Roman arms and Roman might . " May any but the blind attend this hearing of Josiah-barTimaeus ? " I asked . He did not laugh . " With your credentials that should not be difficult . " " My credentials are my secret . " " True , so observe as Gamaliel 's guest , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good . Then Jesus will not be summoned . " " Not if the healing is deemed valid . For it would be foolhardy to make an issue of the Sabbath at this time against a popular hero . He must be discredited first , and that has not happened . "  |p176I  was chilled by his cold logic , so calculating it seemed evil . " I am just looking at the situation through Annas ' eyes , Judah . To achieve success , one must concern himself not so much with what people say or do , but with what they want . Now ask yourselfwhat the old High Priest wants . " " To stay in power . Everybody knows that . " " Exactly . So ask yourself what would undermine this power ? " " A rival power . " " Precisely , and what else ? " " Trouble with the Romans ? " He gave me an embrace . " You are indeed your father 's son , Judah . " I had only mentioned the obvious . " But it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to your Master . I am sure it would be illuminating . But of course you are too close to him to be dispassionate , and too influenced by wishful thinking . " He waved aside my objections . " I shall see you in the morning . Remember , " he cautioned , " you are but an observer . " As I left I realized that I had not touched my wine . The Court of the Hewn Stone , where the Sanhedrin met , was nearly filled . Only a quorum of twenty-three was necessary in lesser trials , whereas in capital cases a majority of the seventy was usually required . Sessions were customarily held on two successive days to assure the accused the fullest opportunity to reverse the outcome of the first hearing . As always , the law was more merciful than man . I saw many familiar faces in the chamber . Annas sat on a raised platform facing the tribunal , and slightly below sat the Nasi , the Reb Gamaliel . I took a seat in a back row of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Nasi . Near the prisoner 's dock , I noticed Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea , quietly waiting for the proceedings to begin . The charges were brought by the Rabbi Ezra , but as the accuser he could not be a witness . Caiaphas , the Prosecutor , took his place at the head of a long table . Two witnesses were necessary , andp177since the accused was hardly a bona fide witness against himself , I wondered who the others might be . With a start I recognized the disciple Cestus , who I remembered now had been in the company t hat day . He was my responsibility , since I had named him , and Dysmas and Joshua-bar-Abbas as well , after they had shown some interest in using this cloak to cover their activities for the cause . From time to time , I received reports of their forays and wondered whether I had done the right thing . I comforted myself with the thought that they were toiling in the vineyard of the Lord , spreading Christ 's word , even as they were collecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I was not so sure , seeing the recklessness in Cestus . Two others sat across from him at the witness table , an elderly couple , obviously of the working classes , for the needles in the man 's rough cloak proclaimed him a tailor . They appeared uneasy , heir eyes showing their awe of Annas in his shimmering gold-ands  --  bite robes . The charges were of the flimsiest sort : that Josiah had conspired to break the Sabbath , then perjured himself in the bargain . What kind of a charge was this ? Obviously , it was nothing but a ruse to get at Jesus . Josiah-bar-Timaeus was the first witness . He stepped forward timorously and stood on the witness stand , his hands nervously grasping the rail . Caiaphas approached him slowly . " Your name , " he asked in a tone he would have reserved for a dung heap . Josiah barely had time to reply . " Your occupation ? " Josiah 's face showed his bewilderment . " I have none , " said he , " for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could do to restrain a chuckle . The Prosecutor thundered . " Mind your tongue , man , and answeronly the questions . " Josiah looked about helplessly , no doubt wondering how it had helped to gain his sight.  | " Yes , Sir Prosecutor . " " And you live where ? " " On the road to Jericho , with my parents . " He pointed his hand in his eagerness to please . " They are at the table , sir . " And so that explained the elderly couple . " Explain what you were doing at the Pool of Siloam . " " Seeking alms , sir , as is the custom of the poor and the blind . " Caiaphas looked at him contemptuously . " But why this particularplace , when it would have been easier to do your begging closerto home ? " Josiah 's eyes shone across the chamber . " I hoped for a miracle , sir . " " A miracle . " Caiaphas pounced on the word . " What kind of a miracle ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How long have you sat at the pool ? " " Some twenty years . " " And you have been in the waters ? " " Many times . " " And you were not healed ? " " No , sir . " " Did you know anybody that was healed ? " " Only by what they told me . For I could not see for myself . " There were some titters among the Pharisees . The Prosecutor reacted angrily . " Never mind what you could n't see . That is what this examination is about . " Josiah smiled inanely . " Whatever you say , sir . " Caiaphas spoke very deliberately now , as if to give the questioningnew importance . " How did you still hope for a miracle when there had been none all these years ? " The witness 's eyes glistened . They were hazel eyes , and they held a look of constant surprise , as if the owner could not get over the shock of what everything looked like . " Because I had heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing all manner of healing , even bringing the dead back to life . " " And who is this man ? " Josiah shrugged . " Some called him the Deliverer , others said he was the Son of David , the rod of Jesse promised by the ancient prophets . " " And how knew you of these prophecies , blind as you were from birth ? " Caiaphas ' eyebrows arched mockingly . The words gushed out . " My good parents are pious Jews , of the Pharisee persuasion , who read me from the Prophets from child-hood . " I could see the satisfied smiles among the Pharisees . " Even so , " said Caiaphas , " why would this Son of David , as you call him , single you out ? " " My dear parents have always told me when I despaired that I must keep faith and not question God 's will . " I myself had questioned the Master 's choice of this man . But I saw now he must have been chosen for the occasion . Sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the hearing . " What claims did this man make ? " " None . " " What did he call himself ? " " The others called him Master , but he claimed nothing . " " Did you not call him the Son of David ? " " Only because I overheard the others . " " Did he not say he was a prophet ? " Josiah hesitated . " When asked , he merely nodded . " " Did n't you take this for consent ? " " He must surely have been a prophet , for - how else could he have healed me ? " " This cure you speak of , " said Caiaphas , " tell the court how this was done . " Josiah repeated how Jesus had made the clay and placed it on his eyes . " I washed then in the pool and could see . " For a moment , Caiaphas looked like the cat that swallowed the dove.  | " Had any ever been healed in this pool ? " he asked again . " As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard . " " Then there have been some ? " " Not that I could tell with my own eyes . " I could see the Prosecutor 's exasperation mounting . " But there were healings , or you would not have heard , is that not correct ? " " I would not swear to it , sir , for I . . . " Caiaphas cut him off angrily . " Were you aware of the day on which you were presumably healed ? " " You mean , when my sight was restored ? " " The day that the Son of David , as you put it , violated the law . " Josiah was now plainly confused . " I know of no law that was broken . " " Were you not aware this was done on the Sabbath ? " " I did not think of it , sir . " " Were you not aware that it is sinful to participate in any public function on the Sabbath , even to wash , for that matter ? " Josiah 's face dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That does not excuse you . " Until now , the Rabbi Gamaliel had followed the proceedings silently . " Are you questioning that this man was healed ? " he asked . Caiaphas turned to him in annoyance . " Since it is a sin to labor on the Sabbath , then this man , Josiah , and the other must be sinners . How can a sinner perform such a miracle ? " Gamaliel 's wise old eyes twinkled . " In truth , that is the crux of it . Can a sinner perform such a miracle ? " Caiaphas too late saw the trap he had set himself . I smiled at the scowl on Annas ' face . " If I may say a word "  --  Annas held out a well-manicured hand  --  " it seems to me that evidence for a miracle hinges on proof that this man was sightless from birth . "  |p181Gamaliel  nodded approvingly . " For that reason , we have summonedthe parents of this man . " At this point an unusual interruption occurred . A Temple guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animatedly to he High Priest . Annas listened with a solemn face , then beckoned Caiaphas . They conversed for a few moments , and the guard withdrew . There was a rustle of curiosity in the room , but the hearing continued as if there had been no interruption , save for a certain abstraction on Annas ' part . " First I would call a disciple of this Jesus of Nazareth , " Caiaphas announced . " It might have served more purpose , " said Gamaliel , " to have called the Nazarene himself . " Caiaphas shot him a resentful look . " The independent witness is always better than the one witnessed . " " Proceed with your independent witness , " said the Nasi . Cestus ' eyes roamed the courthouse boldly , stopping when they came to me . He seemed startled , and gulped nervously , but still stepped firmly into Josiah 's place . Caiaphas spoke more confidently now . " You are a disciple of this Jesus ? " Cestus nodded . " I am . " " Do you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you see him heal this Josiah-bar-Timaeus ? " " I did . " " Had you any way of knowing this man was blind ? " " Only that he said so . " " Hall . " A gleam came to the crafty eyes . " Only that he said so . Did you have doubts of the healing ? " " None whatsoever . " It was more and more confusing . " And why was that ? " " Because I had seen miracles as great , even to healing a vermima'sleper before my very eyes . " " ' Him this Jesus is the prophet he claims to be ? " Cestus shook his head grimly . " I Ic is more than a prophet.  |p182When  I heard that he changes water to wine and walks on the sea , I knew then that he was the Anointed of Israel , the Deliverer , the Messiah we have waited for . " Caiaphas strutted before the Nasi . " You see , we deal here with a more dangerous situation than we thought . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so misguided as to border on treachery . " You fool , you unadulteratedfool , " I thought . But help came from an unexpected source . " This testimony , " said Annas severely , " is only opinion . " I could see a semblance of surprise in Caiaphas ' eyes , and even a dent in Gamaliel 's habitual control . " And for this reason , " Annas imperturbably went on , " it is not admissible at this time . The witness is dismissed . There are no more witnesses . " But the Rabbi Gamaliel was not to be disappointed . " Let us not forget the parents of the accused , " said he . " They should be heard before the tribunal arrives at any verdict . " Annas grudgingly acceded . It was necessary to call only the father , since a woman 's testimonycould not contradict her husband 's . Timaeus was a simple tailor , a God-fearing man who subscribed to the Pharisean belief in a world hereafter . Gamaliel , with a look to Annas , asked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Pharisee asked a few questions of this devoteeof the Pharisee teaching ? " " Not at all , " said Annas , " the Pharisees have equal voice in the deliberations of this court . " Gamaliel 's questions were gently probing . " This Josiah , " said he , " is your son ? " Overawed , Timaeus coughed nervously . " Yes , by my good wife . " " Now , was this son blind until healed by the man known as Jesus ? " " I did not see the healing , " said Timaeus , " so I can not vouch for it , except as I learned about it from my son . "  | " Was your son able to see at all ? " " He was totally blind . " " Did you consult physicians ? " " Even the Egyptian and Greek physicians , but to no avail . He was born without an optic nerve . " A murmur of disbelief rippled through the room . " How could he see even now without an optic nerve ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So the physicians said , and so we lost hope . " He looked up for a moment and his eyes gleamed . " It was a miracle . Nothing else ! " " How do you explain it ? " " I have not seen this Jesus of Nazareth . But my son tells me there is a luminescence about him that defies description . " " But how does a mere man perform such a miracle ? " " He was surely sent by God , " said the old man . " God listens not to sinners , but if any man be a worshipper of God and does his will , him he listens to . " There was a dead silence in the chamber , and then a rising crescendoof wrath . Caiaphas rose angrily to his feet . " Who are you to preach to us , old man ? " Josiah rushed to his father 's aid . " My father speaks the truth . This man was surely sent by God . " Caiaphas burst into a towering rage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " dare lecture the Temple Chiefs in your abysmal ignorance ? Away with you , before we clap you in chains . " " Do we put this matter to a vote ? " interposed Gamaliel in his most urbane style . The High Priests exchanged covert glances , and I could see Annas barely wag his head . " These are such clods , " said the Prosecutor , " that it would be absurd to consider their testimony . For this reason , I recommend no determination at this time . " Annas nodded his agreement . It was a most surprising development . But the matter still hungp184over Jesus ' head . That was clear . The Rabbi Gamaliel quickly joined in the dismissal . " For the sake of the community , we accept the Prosecutor 's recommendation . " I chased after Cestus in the hall . " What foolishness is this ? " I demanded . His manner was surly . " Something is needed to wake him up . If his enemies name him the Deliverer , then he must deliver , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " this borders on treason . " " The man is for Israel , not Israel for the man , " said he , turning around what the Master had said about the Sabbath . I looked for Joseph and Nicodemus , but they had slipped out a back door . I soon found out why . At the front door I recognized the guard who had spoken to Annas earlier . He made us a low obeisance . " Go out at your own risk . The people have gone mad . " I reached for the latch . " We have nothing to fear from the people . " " For , " added Cestus , " we are the people . " An astounding sight greeted us . The Court of Gentiles was jammed solid with people . They stood , heads bared , without a sound . Some carried swords and spears , others had raised standards which said : " Jesus of Nazareth , the King of the Je ' : vs . " I knew now why there had been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans , Annas had learned long ago that he who mixes discretion with valor lives to fight another day . The throng was well-controlled and orderly . Yet it conveyed a greater threat than any undisciplined mob . In the forefront I saw Simon the Zealot . He brandished a sword in one hand and a spear in the other . Obviously , he did not believe that they who live by the sword die by the sword . This was not a helpless mass of pilgrims . My eyes traveled to the Fortress towers . The red-cloaked Roman soldiers stood in full battle array . But there were no mocking smiles today . They were tense , quietly ready , as the legions always are . But even though their commander stood among them , his skull gleaming in the middaysun , no command came . Pilate was too much the diplomat.  |p185Rome  could tolerate one massacre , but two in such rapid succession might indicate an uneasy hold on the reins of government . And this was a crowd of a different temper . Cestus held up an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried , " was vindicated here today . " A deafening roar , as of one man , arose from the throng . " You see , " said Cestus with a wave to the grinning Simon Zelotes , " how easy it is . " A sense of disquietude came over me at this moment of apparent triumph . I looked up again at the tower , at the tall commanding figure in the garb of Rome . There was a smile on his face.  |p186JESUS  ENJOYED WOMEN , and they enjoyed him . Heliked the sweet softness of their voices and the gentleness of their manner . There was a secret nature about women that appealed as well to his sense of the mystic . Perhaps because of his closeness to his saintly mother , he associated all women with her in his ideal of chastity and virtue . Contrary to custom , he held all women in the same respect in which he held men . Their needs and functions were different , but their humanity was the same , and he showed them the same consideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " because they are made less before the law . They can not sit in the synagogue with men , must lag behind in the street , and have no standing in court . They do not even have security in marriage and hence are helpless since the professions are barred to them . " He rigidly opposed moral standards which demanded more of women than men . And he abhorred the ancient practice of stoningp187degraded women in the public marketplace for their sins . " Is their degradation not enough of a cross for them to bear ? " All but John had put aside loved ones to join him , so it would seem that he was making our loss appear the greater by exalting the female . He did not disagree . " The more you give , the more you gain . " Peter , as usual , seemed to have the most trouble understanding . " Why , Lord , was it necessary to give up our families ? " He shook his head in mock wonder . " Peter , whom I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you not the word I sent to illy own mother and brethren when they waited outside the door ? " " You said you had no family . " " I said my family was the world . " Thomas , always the skeptic , received this with a frown . " But then are not our wives and children of this world , too ? " " But no more so than others , when you have chosen to minister to all equally in the Kingdom of Heaven . For as I have said many times , it is not possible to serve two masters . The love of family , while a delight , must needs infringe on the love we are deputized to bring in God 's name . " In my current state , the vision of Rachel 's lovely face and form played tantalizingly through my mind . " May we not cling in some way to this love for a woman and still serve the world at large ? " Ile considered me gravely . " You , Judah , would be a captain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , the soldier with a wife and child to consider at home , or the bachelor whose whole being is committed to a sacred cause ? " Even Peter 's eyes lighted up , and I silently agreed . But how does a man conquer the fevers that beset him as he vainly seeks sleep ? I was no Fssene perpetually committed to celibacylike the Baptist , nor , like the Master , totally caught up in the lives of others . Simon the Zealot harbored similar misgivings.  | " Is it natural , Master , " said he , " to subdue the urge God has put in the loins of all men ? " There was a stillness , as the eyes of the Twelve flew to the Master 's face . The Master was seldom diplomatic , accounting too much tact a form of dissembling . And so , again , he made no effort to cater to our wishes . " In Moses ' time , it was Thou shalt not commit adultery . ' But I say , whoever looks on a woman to lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was quick to protest . " But adultery , Master , applies only to man and wife . How can a single man violate the commandment , unless , like King David , he consorts with a married woman ? " Peter had to show his superior knowledge . " Bathsheba , " he said with a smile , " was a widow . " " Yes , " I snapped back , " and who made her a widow ? " Jesus had followed the exchange with a wisp of a smile . " David lusted after the woman , " he said , " and soon the thought became the act . " " With murder added as well . " The Master frowned , for his love of David was always apparent . " David repented , yet he still suffered the retribution of the Lordin his declining days , when the son he loved turned against him . " I had no intention of being turned aside . " Adultery and fornication are not the same , for the single man can fornicate as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , the greatest infidelity of all . " " But how , " I asked , " can one then love a woman , without being married ? " " Love has many expressions , Judah , and I say again that spiritual love is tenfold that of the flesh . " I found an unexpected ally in young John . " Master , must one remain a virgin till the wedding night ? " Jesus replied with the fond smile he reserved for the youngest ofhis company . " It means , dear John , that one must remain pure inone 's thoughts . " He regarded us all gravely . " All here are chosen for other things , our energies expressed in other creations . "  | " But what , Master , " said John with his guileless air , " is greater than man 's love for his brethren ? Have you not told us time after time to love one another ? " " You have all been chosen for a purpose greater than self . You are instruments of a grand design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As you know more of God 's purpose , what you have turned your back on will seem a small price to pay for the light you bring the world . " Jesus ' eyes moved from Andrew to Peter , to the sons of the Thunderer , and down the line until they fell on me . " You Twelve represent the majesty and meanness of man . No sacrifice will be too much for you , no betrayal too small . Some of you , reflecting the passion of man , will suffer in my name . Others will rejoice knowing what I tell you is true . You doubt now , as generations shall doubt until God restores his people once again and the Son of Man returns a second time with the trembling of the sky and the breaking of the earth . " I cared not about distant earthquakes but about the nagging present . Had he himself not said : " Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof " ? He was a pragmatist himself . When the disciple 1 ) ysmas asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he believed in the moment . " Follow me , " said he , " and let the dead bury the dead . " Every day in Jerusalem we went to the Temple . He sat in a familiar place , in the shadow of the colonnades in the Portico of Solomon , where he could preach to Jew and Gentile alike . He seemed to enjoy most his encounters with his adversaries , and more than once I caught a mischievous gleam in his eye when he was hoisting some petty Pharisee on a spear designed for himself . His logic was unassailable , and this nettled them greatly . For before his ministry they monopolized the field of learning and shared the adulation of the audience with no man . He called them nit-pickers and invoked the name of the Baptist in attacking their hypocrisy . " John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and you said : He has a devil in him . ' Then came the Son of Man eating and drinking , and you say : Behold a gluttonous man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinners . .  |p190He  used them as a sounding board , while they tried to indict him out of his own mouth . It was absurd to think they could contend with him . But they kept trying . Joel of Hebron , a rich landholder and a Pharisee , had invited the Master to sup with him . Only I of the Twelve went along , since Joel had little regard for Galileans . We entered by way of a flowered atrium and walked through a marble arch into a vast dining room teeming with servants . It almostseemed as if the wealthy Pharisee were seeking to make the Master aware of the beauty and comforts available through worldly abundance . I was surprised , as we sat down , reclining Roman style on huge pillows , that there were only the three of us . For I had half suspected a jury of some sort , of carping , caviling Pharisees . The dinner was sumptuous . Fruits and cheeses , and fish and fowl of every kind , and a roast of lamb , browned to a succulentrichness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this fare . The Master ate sparingly and merely touched his lips to a rare Greek wine served in golden cups . He looked past the Pharisee to the door from time to time , as if expecting somebody to come through it . I addressed myself wholeheartedly to the meal , for seldom , since I had left my own home , was I able to enjoy so elegant a repast . Absorbed as I was , I was unaware of another presence until I felt a breath of air as a dancing form breezed lightly past me . I looked up , startled , to see the Master gazing at a scantily clad young woman gyrating seductively before our eyes . I stole a look at the Pharisee , and in his crafty eyes there was a gleam of satisfaction . The woman was well formed , but her features were undistinctive , marred by a slight cast in one eye , an affliction which is commonlycalled a yetzahara . She danced with a certain animal-like vehemence , but it was obvious at a glance that dancing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she swept low before the Master , and in a swift curtsy , before he could stop her , kissed his sandaled feet . As she crouched on the floor , as if suspended , he leaned forwardp191with a look of compassion and said gently : " God bless you , daughter , for you have been more sinned against than sinning . " She held up her head , and her dark eyes were moist . " Master , I have heard you speak in the street , and in my unworthinessI have found myself drawn to you . " By now I was sure it was some trap . " How is this woman here ? " I asked sharply . Before the Pharisee could answer , the Master had waved my protest aside . " What matter why she is here , so long as she is here ? " She now stood up and fetched an alabaster box filled with a costly spikenard of the finest moss and laid it on the floor by his side . " This is for your comfort , Master . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to buy it ; it was plainly a slight to the Master that he should be contaminated in this way . I looked angrily at the Pharisee , who appeared to be enjoying himself , and sought to divert the gift to the treasury . " I will take this expensive unguent and sell it and give the money to the poor . " The Master shook his head . " Do not trouble this woman because she would do something for me . Do you not know , Judah , that the poor you shall always have with you , but me for only a short time ? " She began to weep , the tears streaming down her face . He sought to comfort her , but the sobbing only increased . Suddenly she kneeled , and with a graceful gesture removed his sandals and began to wash his feet with her tears . And , with the long tresses of her hair , she wiped his feet dry and commenced to anoint them with the ointment . The Master had closed his eyes and seemed oblivious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Galilean , " he said when she had risen once more to her feet and was gazing at him spellbound . " I am from that part , " said she , " and when I was a little girl I heard stories of one like you who would deliver the people of Israelp192from their sins . Later I listened as you spoke of salvation from sins through penitence , and I wept for what I am . " " And what are you , " he said gently , " but a child of God ? " Joel the Pharisee obviously felt that the Master had been found wanting . Behind his hand he leaned over and whispered in my ear : " If this Jesus of yours was a true prophet , he would surely have known that this woman whom he allowed to touch him , and whom he has touched , is a confirmed sinner . " The Master , overhearing , turned to him with the same smile he had for the woman . " I have something for you to think about , Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will , " said Joel good-naturedly . " There was a certain creditor who had two debtors . The one owed this man , whom we shall call Joel , five hundred pence , the other owed him but fifty pence . Neither could pay him and so , having no other course , he forgave each their debt . Now tell me Joel "  --  the Master 's voice sank confidingly  --  " which of these two shall cherish him most ? " Joel 's brow knit in concentration . " I suppose he to whom most was forgiven . " " Exactly , Joel . You have considered well . " As the Pharisee preened himself , the Master 's face grew dark . " See this woman , Joel . Mark her well , for she stands as a judgment on you . I entered your house , and though you served a fine supper , you gave me no water for my feet , as is our custom . But she washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with friends , but this woman since the time she came in has not ceased to kiss my feet . You did not anoint my head with oil , but this woman did so with the costliest ointment . " Joel seemed flustered , knowing that , in his desire to belittle his guest , he had neglected the simple amenities of a host . " You have shamed yourself with this woman , " he blustered , " and now you accuse me . " " You are your own accuser , Joel . And for this reason I say unto you that her sins , which are many , are forgiven . For she lovedp193much . But to whom little is forgiven , the same loves little . You , Joel , are forgiven little . " Joel , in his discomfiture , averted his face and turned his back on the woman he had hired for the occasion . Without a glance for the Pharisee , she approached the Master and reverently kissed his hand . " Go in peace , " said he . " We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for you fill my heart with song . And it has been empty these many years . " " I will take the devil out of you , and you shall be as an angel of the Lord . " Before my very eyes , the woman 's face assumed the tranquillity of a saint . I looked at her in astonishment . " Master , how did you this ? " " Judah , Judah , " he cried , " how many miracles must there be before you know that the Son of Man performs only what you and the others can do with faith in the Father ? " In truth , I had discovered in myself an ability to heal and to tranquillize the sick and troubled that I would not have suspected . I had noticed , without comprehending , that whatever healing powers I had dwindled when my mind was not completely on the person to be healed and there was no feeling of accord with nature . It was almost as if the healing gift functioned through a special channel which became stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding atmosphere . " Think of the living breath from the Father , " Jesus said , " and with this breath comes the living force from God 's universe . " " Is there not a healing vibration in the atmosphere which the healer captures and then transmits to the subject ? " " You speak of mechanics , not the source , Judah . It is like treatingthe symptoms rather than the disease . " The woman had listened carefully to all this , but it was obvious it was beyond her comprehension . In her simpleness , she related only to the magnetism of the M aster . " May I follow you ? " she cried , again kissing his feet . Again he raised her.  | " The time will come , " he promised , " when none will follow with a greater faith to a greater place . " He watched her depart with a sorrowful face . " We shall meet again soon , " he said , " never fear . " We had pitched our camp on the Mount of Olives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city only to pray or purchase the few provisions we required . I normally supervised the buying , for I held the purse strings , but I did not like shopping in the Temple stalls . The prices were exorbitant , for the pilgrims would pay anything to say they had made their purchase in the seat of God 's worship . Since I held the money closely , the others conformed to my wishes as well . One day I had gone for provisions in the Street of the Cheesemakers , as it again gave me the opportunity to converse with the Amharetzin and sound out volunteers for the time of the rising . I had purchased some goat cheese , which stood up well in the warm weather , and a quantity of dried figs and dates , the Master 's favorite fare . The other disciples had meanwhile fanned out in the poor quarter of the city for additional supplies . As I headed for the Temple , where the Master had been holding court earlier , I noticed a disheveled , distraught-looking woman of forty or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said she , " know you anything of a teacher they call Joshua , who they say can accomplish all kinds of wonders ? " " I know of such a man , " I said noncommittally . She gave me a harried look and pushed back the hair from her eyes . " Is it true what they say of him ? " The Master had enjoined us to be cautious . For all I knew , though it did n't seem likely , she could be a Roman spy . They had their people everywhere . " What do they say ? " I shortened my steps to her pace . " That he can heal the sick and turn water to wine . " She gave me a sharp , probing glance . " Some even whisper that he is the PromisedOne of Israel , sent to deliver us from the pagan invader . " The thought again struck me that she might be an agent of Pilate 's , for it was rare in Israel for a woman to accost a stranger in public so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , sparring a little . " Why say you that ? " " I have friends who are Galileans , " I said with a secret smile , " and you speak with the same curious sibilance as they . " " I have been in Jerusalem since I was widowed and prided myself I had no accent . " She had been distracted for the moment , but the worried frown soon reappeared . " I look for my daughter , and I thought this man of miracles might be able to help me . They say he can even help the dying . " " How long is she missing ? " I inquired as we moved along at a snail 's pace toward the Temple . " Some seven years . " She then proceeded to enlighten me with a garrulousness that caused me to reconsider my earlier judgment . No spy could prattle so much about so little . " My husband and I sought to wed our daughter to a young man not of her choosing . She fled on the eve of the wedding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it that anybody would so afflict their own flesh and blood ? She hesitated for a moment , then said with a frankness that some oddly reserve for strangers : " She was precocious beyond her years , and we feared for her chastity . For she was attractive to men much older , though she suffered from a minor affliction . " Ilow strange a coincidence , that both this woman and the , Master were so deeply concerned with woman 's virtue . " How old was your daughter ? " " Fourteen , old enough to be wed . " I Icr story recalled the young woman healed by Jesus only a few nights before . She , too , was a Galilean , and would have been of the daughter 's age . But of course this was straining coincidence . Yet , just as he helped the one , he could help others . I was sure he could do anything . And now that my suspicions had subsided with her jabbering , I wondered how the woman came to speak of the Al cssiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she with a faraway look that almost made her attractive . " In that dream , I saw the Anointedp196One of Israel , the Deliverer for whom my people have so long prayed . " " But you are a Galilean . " " And so was he , a stalwart young Galilean , with bronze hair and blue eyes , and the lean , supple strength of ten . " I started in spite of myself , but said with a smile : " What do Galileans have to do with Israel 's fondest hope ? " " I am Judean , from my mother 's side , and so was he . " " Judean on both sides . " I spoke under my breath . How incongruous that the rough land of Galilee , so blemished in its blood and aspirations , should figure so prominently in the adventof the Messiah . Jesus said life 's mysteries were hidden from the wise and prudent and revealed to the simple and the uninitiated , and he may well have been right in choosing the Galileans on this ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Galilee , but , still , she could dream , a dream I had seen in the eyes of many women as they gazed on this man apart . Perhaps it was he that she had seen . We were in strange times , when coming events cast long shadows before them . Who knew but that it was a portent given the uninstructed and denied the cynical and sophisticated ? " And this dream you had ? " I said with mounting interest . " It was the strangest thing . I saw him bending over and blessing a young woman . And this woman , from what I could see of her face , was my own daughter . " " Why should your daughter be with the Messiah ? " " I do n't know . That has always puzzled me . But the dream was so vivid that I never doubted it . Alas , it never materialized . " It was obviously nothing , a silly woman 's mirage , born of Israel 's abiding desire for her savior . And yet I felt drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your dreams ? Did he ever materialize ? " " I thought I saw him once , in a synagogue in Magdala . He came from Nazareth , and he preached while I stood next to his mother in the loft upstairs . She looked barely old enough to be his sister . " " And her name ? " " It was Miriam or Mary , Hebrew or Aramaic , as you will . " Shep197sighed . " I must have been mistaken . For that was ten years ago , when he could have been little more than twenty , and I have not seen or heard of him since . Surely , had he been the Messiah he would now be known throughout the land . " Conversing easily , we had passed a number of decrepit buildings , holding our noses against the gagging stench of offal . Then from the Street of the Winemakers and the Street of the Goat Herders , we attained a slight rise where we could see the Temple plainly . Stopping a moment , we could make out a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There the Master was sure to be , for all crowds gravitated to him . From where we stood , it was clearly an angry crowd . Shrill voices vibrated in the thin air . " Kill , " they shouted . " Kill , kill , kill . " For a moment I had a sickening feeling and started to run on ahead , beckoning the older woman to follow as she could . She half lurched after me , stumbling a little . Panting breathlessly , she caught up with me at the fringe of the crowd . I could see now that it was a raging mob , dominated by the Scribes and Pharisees . The object of their wrath was a slim woman of twenty-one or so , who was defiantly tossing her long black curls . There was not a hint of fear in the flashing eyes or the lissome body crouched as if ready to spring . With a start , I recognized her . How fragile the flesh , how weak human resolve . She had been healed and saved , and had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things , of course . He had planted himself firmly by her side , his hand raised and a glint of fire in his eye . A stone flew past him , and with a thud struck the young woman on the head , knocking her to the pavement . The Master moved quickly between the crowd and the prostrate figure . A second stone , hurled from the rear of the crowd , thumped against his chest . His piercing eyes jumped out at the throng , and his face clouded over like a thunderhead . " Stop , " he cried in a voice that shattered the crisp autumn air.  | " He who throws another stone shall die in sin , without hope of salvation . " I could see the hesitation in the crowd . They looked to the Pharisees and Scribes , and these worthies , shamed by his wrath , cast their eyes sheepishly away . Still , a mob , once aroused , does not easily give up . And I was looking around warily at these cowards , when I was startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My daughter , my daughter , " cried the woman with the dream , " they have killed my daughter . " She would have thrown herself protectively onto the prone body but was stayed by the strong hand of Jesus . Swiftly he kneeled and tenderly examined the young woman , breathing into her mouth and touching her on the temple , where a welt now showed . " Rise and be well , Mary Magdalen , " he said quickly . She sat up , rubbing her eyes . The Pharisees and Scribes stood sullenly at bay , and the mob which they had directed , awed by the apparent miracle , nervously backed off , allowing the stones to slip from their hands . Our old friend , the Rabbi Ezra , and the Master faced each other across the expanse of a few feet . " This woman , " said Ezra coldly , " was taken in the very act of adultery , and under the law of Moses sentenced to be stoned . " Jesus returned his look with a benign smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given the man with whom she was caught ? " A shock wave went through the crowd . " But the law makes no reference to the man . " The Master 's eyes moved mildly over the crowd . " How does one sin alone in adultery ? " I laughed inwardly at the Rabbi Ezra 's discomfiture . " Do you set yourself up as greater than the law ? " he shouted . With all eyes on him , the Master stooped and wrote on the ground , his finger tracing easily through the loose soil . Then raising himself , he peered over the rabbi 's head into the crowd and repeated what he had written : " He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at this woman . "  |p199Under  his gaze , many in the crowd began to melt away , avoidingthe glance of the Pharisee leader , who was beside himself with wrath . " Cowards , " he cried , " shameful cowards . " There was a shadow of a smile on the Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his finger . And to those still lingering uneasily , he read again what he had written : " Let him who has not lain with this woman or any other , let him cast the first stone . " By the time he looked up , all had departed , even the Rabbi Ezra , who had shaken his fist and then shambled away after the others . Save for the weeping mother , we were alone with the fallen woman . She had eyes for only the Master , but he spoke to her sharply , saying : " Comfort your mother , whom you have found here today . Mother , comfort your daughter . " They embraced , but the one called Mary Magdalen quickly returnedher gaze to him . " How do I repay you for twice forgiving me ? " she said . He regarded her gravely . " You will always be remembered for your devotion to the Son of Man . " The mother had recovered sufficiently to be aware of her surroundings . She , too , seemed fascinated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was almost as if the long-lost daughter had not existed , at least in that moment . " Sir , " said she in a tremulous voice , " come you from Galilee ? " " So men would say . " " Have you a mother named Mary ? " " I have no family but in the Kingdom of Heaven . " Her eyes widened now and she slipped reverently to her knees . " You are the Savior of my dreams , " she cried , " the Anointed One of Israel . " The tears streamed from her eyes . " Thank God that before I die I have witnessed the glory of his Son . " T could see that Jesus was strangely moved . " For your faith you shall ascend and be born again . " The mother had seemed in distress from the beginning . And now the shock of her reunion with both her daughter and her dream was too much for her . I Icr face had taken on an unnatural pallor ,  |p200and  her eyes glistened as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , dear God , " she breathed , " for letting me see the Deliverer . " And with these words , before our very eyes , she uttered a low moan and gave up the ghost . I reached quickly for her pulse . There was no throb of life . " She is dead , " I cried , aghast . The Master peered into her face . " Have you ever seen features more tranquil ? " And , in truth , she had a look of peace . " She is with God , " he said . I did not understand why he was so philosophical about her death when he grieved about others . He looked at me in surprise . " Can you not see , Judah , that her mission on this earth is accomplished ? And now , because of her faith , she is with God in a kingdom far more rewarding than this . " The daughter was dry-eyed and unmoved . " I have no family , " she said , " any more than the Master . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for my family is of God and yours is of this world . " " I would be a hypocrite to manifest grief after all these years . Were it not for my parents , I would not be the object of men 's contempt today . They forced me into the streets . " He looked into her eyes . " Do you have a sister ? " " Yes . " Her voice was sullen . " And did her path turn as yours ? " " She was loved more than I. " " Mary , Mary , " he said sadly , " if you love those who love you , what reward have you in that ? Do not even the Romans and the taxpayers do the same . But bless them that curse you , and do good to them that do you evil , and you shall be perfect , even as your Father in heaven is perfect . " She looked down at her body , the flesh gleaming like ivory through the tattered garments , and began to sob . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her with compassion . " Your penitence cleanses you before God , and no others countp201before him . Your accusers are sinners as well and fade before the judgment of the Lord . There is none to accuse you but your own conscience . " He put his arm around her shoulders . " Look well , woman , where are your accusers ? " Her eyes shone gratefully . " You have driven them off , Master . " " What man now condemns you ? " She bowed low . " No man , Lord . " " Neither do I nor the Father condemn you . " He patted her head as she looked at him in silent adoration . " Go and sin no more . With the baptism of the heart , you are purified and reborn . " Jesus looked now to the dead woman . " For the family 's sake , Judah , " he directed , " I would have you take charge of the remains and see that she is buried in sight of God . " Mary Magdalen sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lazarus in Bethany . They were her children as well . " Jesus looked at her closely . " Are they not also your brother andsister ? " Her mouth tightened , and she said severely : " Their door is closed in my face . " " Not for long , Mary Magdalen , for Martha and Lazarus , too , must forgive if they would be forgiven . " Her eyes snapped . " I do not want their forgiveness . " " That is not for you to say , but to receive gladly without their claiming special merit from it . As you are forgiven , forgive them their forgiving you . " At his piercing look , she bowed her head . " Your will be done , Master . " " Not my will , but God 's will . " How often I heard him say this , and yet who knew God 's will ?  |p202WHAT  IS THIS DAY ? " Jesus asked with a twinkle in his eye . " Why , the twenty-fifth day of Kislev . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Simon Zelotes ? " The disciples looked up from their frugal fare of goat 's milk and honey and a handful of grain . " It is the last week of the Roman year , " said Matthew , still thinking in terms of the calendar he once set his taxes by . " It is a day , " said I , " that fills me with sadness . " " And why is that ? " Jesus spoke softly . " It is a reminder not so much of the Maccabean 's glory , but of our continued submission to Rome . How can we celebrate the day Judah Maccabee liberated the Jews when our own deliverance is so slow in coming ? "  | " Our deliverance is not that distant , Judah . " He scanned the sky with a practiced eye . " It is a good day for the High Priest 's procession into the Temple , honoring old Mattathiasand his five heroic sons . " " It is the only day , " I observed sourly , " that the High Priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them new cause to remember this day , Judah . We shall have our own parade . It shall be a people 's parade . It shall be a day sacred to all who know the Prophets , and this knowledge , Judah , you must confess to as a proper Judean . " Rarely did he mention our common heritage , preferring to think of himself , like the others , as a Galilean . And so it had significance , for he rarely wasted words . " Yes , " said he , " this will be a day that even the Prophets will remember . " He had a way of speaking of Isaiah , Elijah , Ezekiel , David , and the rest as if they still lived in the bosom of the Lord . I felt a growing excitement , sensing that he had come to some critical decision . His manner had become crisp and businesslike . " You , Judah , and you , Simon Zelotes , will be my special missionarieson this day . Now listen carefully , and do as I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stood by his elbow , eagerly awaitinghis instructions . " Go into the village of Bethany , " said he , " and as you enter by the main street , you will find a donkey and its foal , which has never been broken . They will be tied to a door . Loosen them , and bring them here . Now , if anyone questions your actions , tell that man the Lord has need of him , and he will help you dispatch the animals . " Neither Simon nor I doubted for a moment that we would find the donkeys , for he had just come from Bethany where he had visited with Mary , Martha , and Lazarus and could easily have arrangedthis . Nevertheless , we felt a letdown at being assigned so trivial an errand . He saw our disappointment . " It will be a clay you will not soon forget , Judah . That I promise you . "  |p204In  a street such as he had described we saw the two donkeys tethered to the door of a small cottage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as we untied the animals one of them protested : " What are you doing with the donkeys ? They are not yours . " " It is for the Lord we do this , " I said . Instantly he drew back , as though I had given the password . " Take them , " he said , " and may God ride with you . " My natural curiosity stirred . " Has this foal never been ridden ? " The man eyed me strangely . " He is your Master and you do not know ? " " Know what ? " said Simon , tiring of the obscure conversation . " That you do what you do so that the Lord 's prophecy may be fulfilled . " With a thrill , I remembered the words of Zechariah : " Rejoice greatly , 0 daughter of Zion ; shout , 0 daughter of Jerusalem ; behold , thy King cometh unto thee . He is just , and having salvation ; lowly , and riding upon an ass , and upon a colt the foal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What kind of a King is it that rides into Jerusalem on a donkey ? " " Do n't you see , he is finally declaring himself as the King of the Jews ? Is that not enough for you ? " " Not when it is his own hand that fulfills the prophecy . " " What difference how it is fulfilled ? All that matters is that he has taken a step forward this day . " He sighed . " Judah , you and the rest are deceiving yourselves . He is not of our temper . He keeps telling us : They who live by the sword shall die by the sword . ' " " But do n't you remember his saying that he did n't come to bring peace but a sword ? " " But , " said Simon , " he did not say the sword would be his . " I looked at him over the donkey 's swaying back . " Then why stay , Simon ? Why do n't you and Joshua-barAbbas , Cestus and Dysmas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I am a Galilean . Is that not enough ? " " You stay because you are loyal ; there is no other reason ? " " All right , " he sighed . " Perhaps one day he will find himself in acorner . There will be no way to turn , and he will confront ourenemies and show them a power greater than theirs . " " And then all Israel will rally behind him . " " All the world , " Simon enthused . " Do n't forget all those slaves in Rome waiting to overthrow the slavemaster . " I could have kissed Simon for rousing my flagging spirits . " You see , we are not in a lost cause . " The word had somehow leaked out that the Master was up to something , and a crowd had collected in the streets on our return . " Hosanna , hosanna , " they cried , " to the Son of David . Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord . " Simon and I helped the Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg , fearful that the Master would look ludicrous making his entrance on a jackass . " He lends majesty , " I said , " to any beast . " Knowing the Prophets as well as I did , the adoring crowds threw down their robes and shawls in his path , to proclaim him the King of the Jews . Others cut down branches and scattered their buds along the roadside , crying : " Hosanna , hosanna , to the All-I lighest , " all the way to the Temple gates . As the procession moved through the Shushan Gate , into the Temple , the crowds grew thicker and more demonstrative . For it seemed all Jerusalem knew the prophesied King would enter meekly on a jackass . All week he had meditated quietly in the Temple , in the Pharisees ' favorite place , in the shadow of the Portico of Solomon . Now as the people in the Temple took up the cry , saying this is Jesus the prophet of Galilee , he motioned the Twelve to lead his donkey toward that center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already gathered there and were listening to the Rabbi I , rra . Ezra looked up with a malignant smile . " Look , " said he , " here comes our King , with not only one jackassbut two . "  |p206Jesus  smiled at the throng as though he had not heard . Simon Zelotes whispered in my ear : " With all these people behind him , it is time for him to declare himself and blow that nincompoopoff his perch . " Jesus dismounted gracefully , then chose a shaded spot some distance from Ezra , squatting comfortably on the stone and bidding us do likewise . Ezra , with a lordly smile , ordered his chair moved closer to the Master . " You would not be avoiding me , Rabbi ? " said he , giving him this title with an ironic smile . " I did not know you were here , " the Master replied with an innocent look . The nature of the crowd had changed somewhat . The Temple guards had driven off many of the Amharetzin and others who trailed noisily after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . In the throng were many who often jeered at him when he preached in the Temple and yet resented his preaching to any but Jews . " How , " said the crafty Pharisee , " do the Gentiles receive this Kingdom of Heaven you speak of when they have not been circumcisedin accordance with God 's covenant with Abraham ? " Jesus replied mildly : " After Abraham there was one law , and then with Moses another . And just as Moses added on and changed the existing law , with the advent of the Son of Man it becomes necessary for the Gentiles only to obey the commandments and know that salvation is with God . " Ezra 's beady eyes were those of a serpent ready to strike . " Among your disciples there is even a tax collector . " Jesus smiled . " The Pharisees should not mind , since that is one tax collector the less . " Only the few Amharetzin in the crowd dared laugh , and Ezra rewarded them with a poisonous glance . " These are already corrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in noise what they lacked in numbers . " What do you say , " one shouted , " to the corruption in the Temple ? " I now saw a familiar face among these untouchables who ob/served none of the dietary laws and scorned clean kitchen vessels for the holidays . It was Adam the Tanner , and he was surrounded by his cutthroat friends with the high-blown names . The guards had moved to silence them but thought better of it when they saw the ruffians were armed with swords and daggers . Ezra gave them a look of horror . " They are worse than Samaritans , " he cried . " They mingle meat and milk products at the same meal in defiance of the law , and feed on swine contrary to Moses . " This drew gales of laughter from the tanner and his band , and I assumed they were already sotted with wine . " One plate and one pot , " cried the tanner , shaking his fist in the air . " Let Jesus speak . We 've heard enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frown , and I could see he liked these Amharetzin no more than he did the Pharisees . " I tell you all , " said he , " worry not so much what you put in your mouth as what comes out of it . There is nothing entering into a man that can defile him . For it passes not into his heart but into his belly . It is from the heart that come evil thoughts , adultery , deceit , and murder . " The tanner 's crew looked mystified by the implied rebuke , for had they not been with those who hailed him King ? " We call you King , " said the tanner , " and you damn us in the same breath with your enemies . " " Why do you behold the mote in your brother 's eyes but do not consider the beam in your own eyes ? " Adam the Tanner was even more bewildered than before . " But we are for you , and the Pharisees hate you . " " The means by which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends . " " Are you not the promised King of Israel . Is this not end enough ? " " The end is not yet here . " I could well understand the tanner 's confusion . " Did you not ride on the donkey , Son of David , " he cried , " so that men would know that by the word of the prophet you were King of the Jews ? " I could almost hear Jesus ' sigh . " There is no kingdom , " said he ,  | " greater than God 's kingdom . To this Heavenly Kingdom you make your obeisance . " Ezra listened impatiently , then proceeded with his attack . " You set yourself up as a lawmaker and put yourself ahead of Moses . " Jesus gave him a scathing look . " I put myself ahead of no man , Ezra . But I see clearly what is in your heart and what comes out of it . You do well to call yourself a truth watcher , for all you do is look at the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusation . " You break the law by touching the lepers , who are forbidden the city , and thus hold all up to contamination . " Jesus arched his brows in mock wonder . " Would you have me deny them the help of God ? " " God has made them unclean , " shouted Ezra . " Why do you object then when he makes them clean ? Surely , you do not credit me with the healing . " Ezra 's venom grew in his frustration , and he returned now to familiar ground . " You have encouraged your disciples to plant and sow wheat on the Sabbath . " Self-righteousness and pettiness infuriated the Master , for they were the false badges of piety . " Hypocrite , " he cried in a voice that caused even Ezra to shrink . " You Pharisees style yourselves good Jews because on the Sabbath you will not tie a knot or eat an egg laid that day . You take pride in not wearing your false teeth or even cutting the branch of a tree , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction on this day . You fast , wearing a long face , trusting that all in the synagogueknow of your piety . But you are hypocrites ten times over . For God asks love , and you give him rubbish . Has this generation of vipers not read what David did when he was hungry ? He went into the House of God and ate the consecrated bread intended only for the priests , and the Lord favored him . " Ezra bounced right back . " It is blasphemy that you should speak for God . " Jesus ' eyes were like gimlets . " Did God so speak to you ? I tellp209you , Ezra , that God can not enter your hardened hearts . The prophet Isaiah , whom you say you revere , has prophesied of this time : These people will hear you , but understand not . And see , but perceive not . For if they see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , they would convert and be healed . ' Isaiah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' And the Lord answered : Until the cities shall be wasted without inhabitants , and the houses without man , and the land be utterly desolate . ' " I le looked at Ezra grimly as my heart leaped with expectation . Were the days of conciliation over ? Was he now ready to be the leader the country wanted him to be ? " My Father is everywhere . He works on the Sabbath day , glorifyingthe flowers , the trees , and man himself . And the Son of Man does the Father 's work on the Sabbath . " Ezra drew back in horror . " You must be deranged to speak of God as you do . " " I only speak what I know , " said Jesus , " and you speak of what you do not know . " Ezra sneered . " You give yourself such airs for a Nazarene , and a carpenter at that . " The Amharetzin , who had been quiet since Jesus ' rebuke , now sent up a great clamor . " What is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does he not give an honest day 's work , so that he can support the ' l'enuple rogues in their luxury ? " Ezra was beside himself with fury , but the Temple guards appearednot to notice , for only the High Priests had authority in the ' I'cmple area . " You see , " he cried in his exasperation , " how you make rebels of these men ? " " I only call them to my Father 's work , that they should see and do no evil . " Ezra stamped the ground in his rage . " Your Father , your Father . 1 low dare you call him Abba , the child 's fond address to his own father ? " Arc you his child ? "  |p210Jesus  shrugged . " You have said . " In his impotence Ezra took a threatening step forward , but a restraining hand was laid on his shoulder and a silken voice whispered in his ear . I would have known that face anywhere , and that twisted little body , no better than its mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that you teach the way of God , and the truth , as you see the truth , and that you have no ambitions of your own . " Jesus smiled . " Speak your mind , friend of God . " Because of Jesus ' popularity with the people , some Sadducees thought it politic to shift the jurisdiction of his guilt to the temporalauthority . Pilate well knew how to quash dissension . And so it came as no surprise when Sadoc inquired : " Is it lawful , Rabbi , to give tribute to Caesar or not ? " " Show me the tribute you speak of , " said Jesus , holding out his hand . One of Sadoc 's company brought him a Roman copper . Taking it , without looking at it , Jesus asked quietly : " Now whose image is on this coin ? " " Why , Caesar Augustus ' , " said Sadoc . " His name and legend are on the older coins , and Tiberius ' on the new . " " You are well versed in Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have not answered the question , Rabbi . " " But I shall . " He held the coin up in the light , turning it over in his fingers . " It has two sides , and both signify the power of Caesar where he has established that power . Therefore , I say to all here in God 's house , render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar 's , and unto God the things that are God 's . " I could have embraced him on the spot . With this deft stroke he had not only turned aside the malice of Sadoc but manifested his independence of Rome . For all knew that the Roman coinage was worthless in the Temple , having value only when traded with the money changers for Jewish silver or copper . Sadoc was quick to see that the trap he had sprung had closed instead on him . But he only moved his crooked shoulders slightlyp211and became even more ingratiating than before . He now sat himself down comfortably before the Master . " I have only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have received your questions before , " Jesus replied with his chin in his hand . " Do you not also set yourself up as the arbiter of truth in Israel ? " " I know the law and the Prophets , " said Sadoc with assumed modesty . " Then you have not the blind man 's excuse for not seeing ? " Again , his guile was no match for the Master 's simplicity . Sadoc 's eyes became thin slits . " Let us proceed from the Prophets of old , with whom you claim special kinship . " " Proceed then . " " You tell the people to give up what they have and follow you . if all do so , who will be left to maintain the community and contributethe services by which all survive ? " " It is in the spirit I bid them follow me , for in work there is also salvation if it is of the spirit . " " You speak of things , " said Sadoc with exaggerated respect , " that not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mocking smile . " If you do not heed Moses , why would you listen to me ? But I tell you again , so that your blindness will no longer excuse you , that the law and the Prophets prevailed until John the Baptist , and since that time the Kingdom of Heaven is preached . " Now rejoining the fray , Ezra appealed to the Temple birds . " This carpenter from Galilee , with no learning that we know of , would put himself above the law . " Jesus gave him a withering glance . " I come not to change the law , " he said with a majesty that made me proud , " but to add to it . Ezra sneered . " And are you the King of the Jews ? We have no King . " This was more than I could brook . " Who then are Tiberius , and Scjanus , and Pilate even , but Kings of the Jews ? "  | " Hear , hear , " cried the Amharetzin , but the Master silenced them with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . " The people looked at one another , bewildered . For the truth was ephemeral , and like the wind . Sadoc answered for the doubtful faces . " Abraham 's seed , as even you know , is not in bondage to any man . So why do you say : You shall be free ' ? " Jesus gave him a disdainful smile . " I know you are Abraham 's seed , but you still seek to kill me because I have told the truth , which I have from my Father . " Sadoc hid his wrath with a smile . " And what is this great truth , Nazarene , that you have had from your Father ? Was he not the carpenter Joseph , and did he not die when you were still a young man ? " " I repeat , if a man finds the Father through me , he shall overcomewickedness and never see death . " Sadoc 's derision was reflected in the faces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Prophets are dead . And so how do you , Galilean bred , say there is no death ? " Jesus ' blue eyes flared . " You say that we have the same God , but I would be as false as you to say that you know him as I do . Even Abraham rejoiced in the knowledge of my coming . " The Pharisees and Scribes laughed till their sides split , and even the Amharetzin showed their puzzled faces . " You are not thirty-five years old , " mocked Sadoc , " and you have seen Abraham , dead some hundreds of years ? " Jesus gazed at his adversaries scornfully . " I tell you , " said he , " that before Abraham was , I am . This you do not understand . For you do not truly worship the Father but only your skins . " On being told they were not good Jews , the Pharisees and Scribes picked up stones and ran at Jesus menacingly . Simon Zelotes and I came between them , but he sternly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he , " they have a devil . "  |p213They  stopped in their tracks , for they regarded him as a magicianwho might cast a spell on them . And indeed , his eyes held that hypnotic stare that had transfixed crowds before . The Amharetzin , to their credit , had taken out their swords and formed a phalanx to safeguard him from violence . But Jesus only shook them off . " It has been said , an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . But I say unto you , here and now , love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use and persecute you . " Adam the Tanner and his rogues looked at him in disbelief . " You say yourself they would kill you . " " Let it be on their heads then , not on yours . " As they stood , arms poised , he turned on his heel and stalked off . I was stunned that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was advancing with purposeon the religious procession then turning into the courtyard from the Probatic Gate . Side by side , holding aloft the torch of light , and proudly enshrined in their sacred vestments , the High Priests Annas and Caiaphas walked slowly as if relishing each step . As the sun had not yet set ushering in the holiday , the bazaars and money tables were doing a frantic last-minute business . Annas smiled amiably as he saw the crowds wrangling in the narrow stalls and trading their shekels at the money changers ' tables . Their route took the priests directly between a shop hawking whiskey and wines and a wooden table where a money changer was berating the throng for not stepping up fast enough . With a tolerant glance , Annas was about to pass when his path was suddenlyblocked by a lean but muscular stranger . He smiled tentatively , then put out a hand as if to remove the trespasser from his path . But something in the stranger 's eye stopped him . Caiaphas ' eyes flew to the Temple guards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had followed after the Master . I looked to Simon Zelotes , for like me he carried a flat sword under his robe . Iie was already standing over the Master 's shoulder.  |p214I  will say for Annas that he never lost his composure . His haughty eyes moved over the assembly , held mine for a moment , without a glint of recognition , then returned to the man so boldly confronting him . In that instant , as the heavy lids drooped over those crafty eyes , I saw that he knew who this interloper must be . " By what right , sir , do you halt this sacred procession ? " Jesus pointed disdainfully to the money changers and merchants , who had only now ceased their commotion and were gaping with dropped jaws . " You call this sacred ? What is good comes out of good , and evil comes only out of evil . And so how say you this procession is sacred , when this evil prevails in God 's place of worship ? " My heart swelled with pride , for with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jackal next to this Lion of Judah . Caiaphas ' eyes snapped , and he was about to raise his hand when Annas waved him off . " Let us hear what this good man has to say , " he said in the bland voice that all Israel mistrusted . " I have been waiting a long time to hear the Nazarene . " Only then did Caiaphas realize who stood before him . But even as his eye searched about for the guards , the wily Annas shook his head . Folding his hands with a show of patience , he said mildly : " Give us a reason , Jesus of Nazareth , that you deter us from God 's sanctuary ? " I had never seen the Master so angry . " Sanctuary , " he cried . " Do the Sadducees know that God warned of this day through the prophet Jeremiah ? Go and proclaim these words toward the north , and say , Return , thou backsliding Israel ; and I will not cause my anger to fall upon you . Only acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy God , and have scatteredthy ways to the strangers under every green tree , and have not obeyed my voice . Turn , 0 backsliding children , and I will give you pastors according to my heart , who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding . ' " Caiaphas could submit no longer.  | " Out of our way , scoundrel , before I have you lashed to within an inch of your life . " Annas ' voice cut in . " Let the man speak . " For he hoped that by his own words he would destroy himself . Jesus ' voice carried Jeremiah 's message to the far corners of the vast courtyard , and not a soul stirred in the great assembly . " In vain , as the prophet said , is salvation hoped for from the hills , and from the multitude of mountains . In the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel . For shame hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth . We lie down in our shame , and our confusioncovers us . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to this day , and have not obeyed his voice . " " Now , " said the High Priest Annas in his silkiest tones , " may we pass ? " Jesus ' eyes traveled down the long procession to the vessels and urns of incense and wine and costly sacrifices borne into the Temple for the ceremonies at the sacred altars . " I have come to finish Jeremiah 's work , and John the Baptist 's , whose life you claimed . " At the angry stirring in the crowd , Annas gave a signal for the parade to move on . " We shall meet again , Nazarene , " said he with a smile . " You see me now in this mockery of God 's house . " Annas led him on . " Would you tear down this Temple ? " " This Temple I can restore in three days once it is destroyed . " " What rubbish this man speaks , " said Caiaphas . " Out of ourway , knave . " " In this place , " rejoined Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he has been mocked long enough . " He turned from the priests and with an incredible fury begandashing the vessels from the hands and shoulders of the bearers . The Amharetzin began to cheer lustily . " Hosanna , hosanna , forthe King of the Jews . " At this salute , Jesus ' frown grew deeper than before . But nothing would deter him . With his supporters surging around him , he approached the nearest table and quickly over/turned it , scattering coins over the marketplace . Adam the Tanner and his crew joyously entered into the occasion , smashing one table after another . They followed him into the shops , where he stormed at the shopkeepers , and joined in flinging out their wares . They were the vultures at the holy feast . " No man , " he cried , " can serve two masters . For either he will hate the one and love the other , or else he will hold to the one and despise the other . You can not serve God and Mammon . " Under the auspices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasure it gave them . " Down with the High Priests , " shouted a drunken Adam the Tanner , and his small legion of Solomons , Isaacs , and Jacobs added their ribald voices to the chorus . Jesus pointed an accusing finger at the tanner . " Sin not with the others . I do what I have to do because it is written . God 's house is a house of prayer , but the priests have made it a den of thieves . Be not as they . " Annas , with a face the color of parchment , confronted the Master . " Is this the law you preach , Nazarene ? " Jesus faced him calmly . " Do you not read in Scripture that the stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the cornerstone ? Therefore I say unto you that the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof . And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken , but on whomever it shall fall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crowd took up the adoring chant " Hosanna to the Son of David , " and would have laid hands on the High Priests had Jesus not restrained them with a glance . I had never seen Annas so moved . " Beware , Rabbi , " said he in a voice of suppressed fury , " lest you be ground into bits . " Jesus gave him a pitying look . " My Father has already made that decision . You do nothing with me that is not of his will . " At the prospect of violence I had nervously watched the terrace above the Portico of Solomon , where the Roman soldiers customarilystood guard during the holy feasts . They were looking onp217cheerfully , enjoying the smashing of the shops and the turning over of the tables . And like their master , Pilate , laughing uproariouslyat the antics of these strange Jews . Annas was loath to precipitate a confrontation which could only result in Roman intervention . He whispered to Caiaphas , and I could see the change immediately in the son-in-law , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fell over his face . There was always another day . After this some feared for Jesus ' life , for he had made it clear there was no room in the land for both him and the priests . I would have preferred that he picked a better time . But still , he had shown a fire that could set all Israel aflame . " In another six months we will be ready to seize every garrison in Palestine , " Simon Zelotes exulted . " All we need is his blessing . " " He still scowls , " said I , " when the people proclaim him King of the Jews . " Simon shook his head ruefully . " If he is the Deliverer , then he must deliver us . Otherwise we take this chance for naught . " " He can do anything he wants . " Simon flexed his brawny arms . " So you say , Judah . " " If God is all-powerful , which we all grant , and Jesus is as one with God , then he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . " Words , words , and more words , Judah , while the Romans speak with steel . "  |p218IT  BECAME COMMONPLACE for the sick to followJesus like sheep . They moved in companies , prostrating themselves in the highway , moaning and groaning so that he could not ignore them . He had said his healings were but for a sign , which was to bring closer communion with God and show that life was everlasting . " I heal , " said he , " only so people will believe in the Father who sent me . " But how could he so love all people , particularly the oppressed , and not stir a finger in their behalf when that was all that was required ? At dusk Jesus had already healed a number of people , delivering his little homilies about God and life eternal , in this vague kingdom of his . He was weary and planned no more miracles that day . And so he drew back as the leper stumbled forward , the stench from hisp219sores clearing a path through the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran through the crowd . John , standing by the Master 's side , whispered in his ear . " Blessed are the merciful "  --  he used Jesus ' own words  --  " for they shall obtain mercy . " And had he not also said : " Blessed are they that mourn , for they shall be comforted " ? He gave a deep sigh . " The Son of Man has no place to hide his head . His days are numbered , and yet this generation comprehends not why he came . The sick you will always have with you , but me for a short time . " Andrew and Peter looked with pity at the misshapen leper , now on his knees , holding out his arms in his wretched helplessness . I could see the indecision in the Master 's face . " The sick become sick , " he told John , " because they have not lived properly , but in the eternity which I offer , they shall dwell happily in the Father 's kingdom . " He turned now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in God and be gone . For great will be your reward in heaven . " There was an angry rustling in the crowd . " If you be the Son of God , " they cried , " then do what God would do . " " How say any of you what God would do , when you speak to him sent of God ? " He faced them fearlessly , his blue eyes flashing fire . " You have no faith , you generation of vipers , for you will not heed the truth unless it be wrapped in a package you know . " I moved closer to the Master , not liking the look of the crowd . " Show this leper mercy , Lord , for have you not said that the boor and the meek shall inherit the earth ? " Ile gave me a peculiar look . " You speak out of your time , Judah . " Mary Magdalen had taken to following him of late , and she too gave him a look of entreaty . I lis eyes turned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery , and his face quickened with decision.  | " Come forward , " he said gently . The leper crawled forward on his stomach , making hideous gutturalnoises . " If I but touch you , " he cried , " I will be saved . " Jesus regarded him compassionately . " You show more faith than my disciples , and for this you shall be made whole . " He touched him lightly and said a little prayer . Before our very eyes the sores fell off in clusters and the skin resumed its normal texture . The fickle crowd set up a clamor , and many rushed forward to kiss his hand . " Hail to the Son of David , " they cried . And this time there was a more insistent cry : " Hail to the King of Israel , hail to the King of the Jews . " He stood quietly with his arms folded , and the look on his face stilled their cries . " There is but one King and one kingdom . And this King has anointed me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to set at liberty whoever is captive . " He had altered his course , for the first time healing for the sake of healing . The inflexible man might be more flexible than he thought . For what was it to liberate a captive but to free Israel , since the entire land lay captive to Rome ? Even as the leper ran off , shouting Jesus ' praises , the Master saw that many of us were rightly confused . " I have only widened the path to heaven , " he said . " Since God made the physical man as well as the spiritual , it becomes proper when necessary to reach one through the other . " Thomas had been eyeing him skeptically . " Now Thomas there has a limpid eye , which casts back a reflection of everything as it is , shape and color , even texture . And his ear warns him of the approaching storm , and of the footpad , or the preying animal . " His eye had a merry twinkle . " Now what man could fashion such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can father a child with these attributes , I say he is only an instrument . The creative power is God 's and still remains a mystery to man , though man applies the principle of creativity in this elemental function because of the instinct planted in him by God . "  |p221Not  understanding the creative force , the disciples were dismayedthat they could not heal as effectively as he . " You have no faith in God and so no faith in the God in each of you . The body is a living temple created by God , as is everything else , from the boundless energy of the universe . And so is subject to God 's laws . " " But so many people who are helped , " said doubting Thomas , " only become ill again . " " It would be strange if it were otherwise , for the body is sensitive to the attitudes which produce illness , hate , resentment , rancor . To heal and stay healed , body and mind must be attuned to the God force that created this temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is this done ? " " God is love . " He made no effort now to limit his healings . The multitudes besieged him even on his pallet of straw . The lame , blind , dumb , and demented threw themselves at his feet , and he raised them whole . When the crowd saw his power , they glorified the God from whom this power came . Matthew scrambled about in the crowds to record the people 's reactions . As long as he satisfied their desires , they worshipped him . " He can be the undisputed ruler of Israel any time he gives the word , " Matthew observed . " And would they revolt against Rome because of him ? " " In their present mood , Judah , they would jump off a cliff for him . But who knows about tomorrow ? " " You have influence with him , Matthew . Would you urge him w commit himself to the cause ? Even Nicodernus and Joseph of rimathea look on the Zealots favorably , and this may influence him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know him if you ! link he can be diverted by anybody short of God . " " We have just seen him heal whoever asks , instead of using this Bower only as a sign . " Matthew shook his head . " He merely redoubled his efforts whenp222he saw that the people readily accepted this sign as proof of God 's power . " I looked at him doubtfully . " Was this his explanation ? " Matthew laughed . " Believe me , he has not changed his view in the least . He told me clearly : The man who has faith in him who sent me possesses eternal life . ' It is only more of the same . " Matthew spoke truly , for Jesus in his healings made no distinctionbetween Gentile and Jew . Indeed , he chose not only to heal the servant of a Roman centurion , but used the occasion to praise this pagan for his faith . Andrew had come to him , saying that the centurion , Cornelius by name , had helped the Jewish community in Capernaum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one God . And now his body servant , who had once saved his life in battle , was gravely ill and none could help . Jesus listened for a moment , and said : " Send this Cornelius to me , for surely he is a goodly man . " " He comes after me , " said Andrew , and we could see the thick figure of the Roman officer coming up the road . He kneeled before Jesus , and the Master raised him , saying : " Rise , for in many ways I am a man like yourself . " The centurion looked at Jesus as if he were a god . " Master , " he said , " my servant lies at home , sick of the palsy , and is terribly tormented . I fear for his life . " Jesus ' eyes went from disciple to disciple , noting the disapproval by some , then he said quickly : " I will go to your house at once and heal him . " Cornelius bowed low , and with that look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not so worthy that Your Lordship should honor me by coming under my roof . And indeed it is not necessary ; only that you should speak the word , and my servant shall be healed . " I saw a smile come to Jesus ' eye . " You are a Roman , and you speak thus ? " " I have seen your works , " said the Roman , " and heard you speak , even at the wedding of Ephraim 's daughter in Cana . " Of course , the dull Roman had become persuaded of the Master 's magic by his turning the water into wine . He saw him as a magician , nothing more.  | " What makes you so sure of my power ? " asked Jesus . " I have many soldiers under me , " said the centurion , whose company numbered a hundred or more , " and when I tell them to come and go , they do as I tell them , for they recognize my authority . " " And whose authority am I under ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you as you speak , and I know that you come as a light to the world . " Jesus ' eyes fell almost mockingly on his disciples . " You hear this man , surely I have not found such great faith in Israel . " " The Roman flatters you , " I said . " How does one flatter God ? For when he speaks of my power , he speaks not of me but who sent me , or he would not have helped the Jews to build a synagogue to the one God . " The centurion looked at Jesus gratefully . " You speak with God 's tongue , Lordship . " " And you speak with such faith that your faith shall not only make you free , but shall free your faithful servant whom you love . Go your way , and as you have believed , so will it be done unto you and yours . " Some time after the centurion had departed a great number of people came unto the Master and sang his praises , for the servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the centurionand a younger Roman . " This is he , " said this Cornelius , " whom you made well . " Jesus , contrary to custom , leaned forward and kissed the Gentile . " One day , " said he , " you shall be baptized and enter the Kingdomof God . For I tell you that many shall come from the east and the west , the north and the south , and shall sit down in this kingdomwith the fathers of Israel . But many that traditionally belong in this kingdom shall be cast out because they had not your faith . " My own faith had become suspect because I had made no considerablebequest to the cause . But I only bided my time to accommodatemy mother 's needs and to ascertain what I could safely divert from my estates into the coffers of the Zealots for the armsp224buildup now going on . Just because I was in charge of the funds was no reason for my giving any more than any other . But I begrudgedthe Master nothing and gave generously for alms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much giving much . My own interest in the poor had provided me with a useful platform for discussing diverse matters with the Master , and since I was confused by his even treatment of Gentile and Jew at this time , I sought a private meeting , with the excuse that I would like to discuss alms for the poor . We had a gift from Joseph of Arimatheafor the Master 's comfort alone , but the Master wanted it returned unless Joseph removed this restriction . He never questioned me about money , for once he delegated authority it seemed to pass from his mind . He looked up at my approach but appeared preoccupied , staring into the fire . I mentioned that Arimathea had withdrawn his stipulation . " Give it to the neediest , " he said , the flickering flames giving his face a ghostly look . " I know you care not where the money goes except to achieve your fondest hope . " His remark gave me pause . " And what , Master , is this hope ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rest until you subdue Rome single-handed . " " Not of myself , Master , but with your help . " " That chestnut will not roast any longer . In the family of man there is no difference between Roman and Jew . " Never before had he been so precise about what it meant to be a light to the Gentiles . " But they are our captors . You came , you said yourself , to releasethose who are captive . " " And so I have . " " But how can this be accomplished without force when it is force alone that imposes this captivity ? " He shook his head sadly . " Do not think I have come to impose peace by force , Judah . I have come neither to impose peace nor yet to declare war . " He smiled at my bewilderment . " Someday you will understand . " " Must you not take a stand ? The Essenes say that John thep225Baptist would have rallied Israel long ago had you not taken the leadership from him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He lives now with the Holy Spirit . And when the Son of Man returns one day , John will precede him as well , caring for the dying all over the quaking earth . " I was struck by his gloomy forebodings . " Is there any happiness for man ? " " Not till he is penitent . " " And will these dying enter the Kingdom of Heaven ? " " Only with faith in the Father , doing his work . " " But still the good perish with the wicked . " " With the holocaust God finally tells man that he permits him to sin no more . " " Then what good was it for the Baptist to die in Herod 's dungeonif nothing is gained of it ? " " As God measures time , a lifetime is only a moment in infinity . " " But the injustices , the inequities , the crimes against man , how long must these continue before God intervenes ? " " He has already intervened , but his word must be repeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration burst forth . " If you preach his word , then you are surely the Messiah . " " I am not your Messiah , nor bar-Abbas ' , nor Ezra 's , nor Sadoc 's , but the Lord 's . For it is not for any man 's vanity that I am sent . " " But how long , and to what end , must we bear Daniel 's iron menwith the feet of clay ? " " All things right themselves , if not in this lifetime , then in another . " " If this life does not count , why should any other ? " " With death ultimately destroyed , man will become aware of the power God has given him to develop his nature with right thinking . " " You speak of Israel 's suffering for its sins , but what of the Romans ? Arc they invulnerable because they are pagans and have no God to fear ? "  | " If you were a Roman , knowing the uncertainty of the times , you would not call them invulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . " " They do not acknowledge the soul , but they will , and what a resurrection that will be . " How could he be as concerned about the pagan as his own ? " Freedom is the same for all , " he observed . I looked at him incredulously . " You have seen Jews hanging upside down on crosses because they offended Rome . Are they as free as their executioners ? " " Only if they know salvation through the Son of Man . " " If not born to be free , to what purpose is our life ? " " We grow through pain , and even though the circumstances are buried deep within the soul consciousness , we do remember , and in remembering , even dimly , improve on our condition , if refraining from the mistakes once made . " " May I ask when this resurrection of man shall take place ? " He regarded me with an enigmatic smile . " You know of Jonah and the whale ? " " A fine fairy tale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , ! or its kernel of truth . Do you recall how long Jonah remained in the belly of the whale ? " " Three days , but of what matter ? " " And so shall the Son of Man remain three days in the belly of the earth . " He would not elaborate . " It will all be unveiled in time . But remember that I come not formyself but to show what all men can do , with the Father 's help . " His lids drooped with fatigue , but I knew no more than before . " One thing would convince people of God 's power more thanany other , " I hastened to say . " And what is that ? " " If you were to show God 's power greater than Rome 's . " He gave me an almost pitying glance . " But do we not already know that ? " " Not only Israel would know it then , but the Roman world.  |p227Wherever  the eagle soared , it would still be no match for the legions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You paint a stirring picture , Judah . Now let us retire and cultivate peace with thoughts of God . " He leaned forward to kiss my cheek . " Peace to you , Judah , who knows so little peace . " I slept fitfully and was up and about early . Of late we were nearly always on the move . For after the crowds gathered the Temple spies would come , and then the agents of Rome . I could visualize the horror in Annas ' crafty face  --  or was it glee ?  --  at their reports . For there was nothing better he could carry to Pilate . There could be High Priests and prophets , inquisitors and tetrarchs , but for the Romans there was only one Deliverer in Israel , and that was Caesar , and Pilate was his emissary . I confided my misgivings to Matthew . " As much could be made of the shadow as the substance , " he said darkly . " Annas , " I said , " has never meant him well , especially since that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharisee leadership , Gamaliel , Nicodemus , and Joseph of Arimathea , he would have been in chains long ago . " " He almost seems to court danger , " said Matthew thoughtfully . " He is not safe in Judea , and I would sound out the Holy City before he moves out of Galilee . " Matthew shook his head . " He will go where he wishes , thinking his steps guided by the Father . " I gave Matthew a quick glance . " Have you doubts ? " " How can you witness what he does and doubt him ? " " I only wondered about your beliefs . " " I have no divided allegiance . " I shrugged off the implied rebuke . " I seek what is best for Israel . " Matthew , without a word , turned and walked away . Tax collectorsare a pretentious lot . It was good to see Jesus relax . IIe seemed to know every mountaintrail and stretch of seashore in Galilee . IIe particularly enjoyedp228his camp overlooking the Galilean Sea , where he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , and bright flowers appeared to lighten the sad face he increasingly wore . Yet , for the sick and needy , he always had a smile and a kind word . He never failed to stop and talk to the children , saying they were closest to God because they had not yet become prisoner to the fears and ambitions that make liars and hypocrites of men . By some strange telepathy through which they divined our movements , the multitudes were at every little crossing long before we arrived . In some cases they gave up their jobs and left their homes to follow him . This excess of popularity , ironically , was a factor in the eventual decline of his fortunes . There were always new and greater demands on him . We had camped on a hillside overlooking the sea , and he could see that many hungered , for they had followed us for three days and had no food . He seemed especiallyconcerned about the poor , I suppose because they could not help themselves . As always , in an emergency , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden on my person , along with a dagger . And so it was perfectly natural for him to ask of me first : " Judah , have you money enough to buy all these bread ? " I groaned , thinking to what good use this money might be put . " But there are not enough markets nearby for such a throng . " He laughed drily . " I see I have your answer , Judah . " " And you , Philip , know you where we might buy bread , that these people might eat ? " " Even if they took whatever money we had , it would not be enough to feed all . " He turned now to his favorite . " And you , John , what would you do ? " John invariably said the right thing . " Moses brought down manna for the hungry of Israel . " " True , " said Jesus , " and what say you , Andrew ? " Andrew could only shrug . " There is a boy here with five loaves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among five thousand ? " He glanced now at Matthew and said : " I can not send them away hungry lest they faint on the way . "  |p229I  could understand his concern , for many looked pale from their fasting and the heat . I saw the boy sitting on the grass between his parents , holding a basket with the food in it . Then my eyes traveled through the crowd . It was a motley group , chiefly of the Amharetzin , in Galileerough tillers of the fields who looked for much because they had so little . They had become restive , desiring to witness the healingswhich now marked his mission . Fully half the multitude was made up of the ailing and their friends or relatives . The disciples moved among them , listening to their plaints , while the Apostles clustered about Jesus as usual . I noted with surprise the disciples Cestus and Dysmas in the throng , speaking to Joshua-bar-Abbas . They had traveled ahead of the company , preaching the word , and were not to meet up with the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd , and I assumed they were comforting the people , for so they made their converts . Jesus saw them as well , but his mind was on the multitude . Andrew , privileged to approach him at any time , said with concern : " Shall we send them away so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves some bread ? " Jesus shook his head . " Andrew , they are like sheep without a shepherd . I would bring them into my flock . For the good shepherdgives his life for the sheep . Before me have come thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them , for they came quietly to steal and destroy . But I come so they may have abundant life . I am the door by which any man may enter and be saved , and where he may graze and find pasture . And there are other sheep I have as well , which are not of this fold . They also I must bring into the pasture of the Lord . They shall hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shepherd . " His eyes were clear and untroubled now . " Moses , with God 's help , guided his flock safely through the Red Sea and into the Promised Land . The same God who helped the Israelites in the desert , providing food when there was none , still would show his people that he is their God . For there are no other gods before him , whatever their name be and whatever their cause be called . "  |p230His  eyes rested on mine for a moment , and then he commanded the disciples to divide the crowd into groups of a hundred . As they sat expectantly , Andrew brought him the basket with its five loaves and two fishes , freely given by the boy and his parents . Taking the basket , Jesus looked into the sky . " Dear Father , give us this day our daily bread , as you blessed your son Moses , invokingthe same forces which caused all things in the beginning . " I had seen the sick healed , and water made wine , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for myself . As Jesus broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples to distribute , new fragments kept multiplying before our eyes . There was no trick , no sleight of hand . He uttered no incantation and had nothing up the sleeve of his robe . The crowd sat as if hypnotized , barely able to believe what it saw , until it ate of the bread and the fish , which had also multiplied of itself . Some quantities still remained as Andrew returned the five loaves and two fishes to the delighted lad . I could see Cestus and Dysmas haranguing the people , telling them that never before had there been such a leader . " He is the Messiah sent by God to deliver us from our enemies , " cried Cestus . " Let this Son of David be our King greater than David , " Dysmasshouted , standing on a rise , the better to be seen and heard . He held up a laurel wreath . " Let us crown this Son of David here and now , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joshua-bar-Abbas , a fiery speaker , capable of stirring the masses , joined Dysmas on the mound and turned an impassioned face to Christ . " By the miracles you have performed , " he cried , " you have shown yourself the Promised One of the Prophets . All Israel has waited for this moment . For with the Messiah comes an end to persecution and oppression . You have no choice but to assume the mantle of your illustrious forebear and , as King of the Jews , to carry the word of God triumphantly to the seventy nations . " Even I , knowing his design , felt the throb of his oratory . And into the tired faces of the multitude , particularly the Amharetzin , had come a gleam of forgotten pride.  |p231I  stole a look at Jesus . His face was rigid , his lips pressed tightly together . He looked like a man who had come to a sudden and shattering realization . " Andrew , " he cried almost in despair , " they do n't understand . They have never understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothingly . " But , like all people , they accept only what they know . And all they know is a sovereign , whether he be Judean or Roman . " Jesus ' eyes turned to the sky . There was a new resolve in his face , and he took a determined step forward , causing those in the forefront to step back hastily . He spoke in a clear voice . " Have you not wondered about this bread that you have just eaten ? Have you not asked how it appearedout of thin air ? Have you not thought that it was not only to be eaten but to be instructed by ? Your fathers also did eat manna from heaven , and they are now dead . But a man could eat of this bread and not die . This is the true bread of heaven , and for this reason God shone on you today . But you have witnessed what has been done and still believe not in the heavenly message . For I came down from heaven not to do my will but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have everlasting life and will be raised on the last day . " The crowd , keyed for an entirely different response , did not take well to his reproach . I heard the rumblings of discontent . " Bar-Abbas is right , " cried a young militant , " for if he is the Messiah , then he should act the Messiah , and lead us like David against the Philistines of Rome . " It was incredible that the tide should turn on so slim an issue , but the passion for freedom burned brightest in the hearts of those with a tradition of freedom . Simon Zelotes was clearly outraged by the pressure on Jesus from his own Zealots . For he had learned to love the Master and believe in him , hoping , as I was , that he would one day see the merit of our cause and take a stand out of his own conviction . We exchanged glances , and both drew closer to the Master . The grumbling continued , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained a little man with a sly smile , " to sayp232that he came down from the heavens ? If he is God , he is not flesh , and all know that this carpenter is the son of a carpenter . " " Maybe , " said another with a wink . " For the father was thoroughlysurprised . " What a mockery of human nature . A moment before , excited by the miracle of the loaves , they were ready to enthrone him , and now that he would not do their bidding , they were ready to pull him down . Only the boy with the basket spoke up for him . " Only God could have done it , " he said in a piping voice . " I put the five loaves and two fishes in the basket myself , and there was no way they could have become hundreds of loaves but for God . " Some were impressed , but others knew not what to think . Takingadvantage of this uncertainty , Joshua-bar-Abbas again confrontedthe Master . " We know nothing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . This is where we live , not in the clouds , and here we take the bread of life , not in heaven . If you are the Messiah , take up the challenge , or put all pretensions aside . " In the flush of his own oratory , he came bounding off the mound , and the impressionable crowd made way for him as he approached Jesus . Jesus peered over bar-Abbas ' head , as if he did n't exist . " You ask for little who could have so much , " he cried scornfully . " I give you everlasting life , for the bread I give is my flesh , and this I offer from the life of the world . " As the crowd stood chastened , bar-Abbas would have placed the wreath on the Master 's head . " Any man who touches him answers to me , " I cried , drawing my dagger . There was a startled murmur in the crowd , for these people had no stomach for violence . Bar-Abbas gave me a murderous glance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rest had formed a protective barrier around the Master . " Have no fear for me , " he said . " I could vanish in a moment , but it is not necessary , for my time is not come . "  |p233Bar-Abbas  again challenged him . " If you are the Messiah , take up this crown . If not , sink back into the obscurity from which you came , for you only confuse the way for the true Messiah . " " Since when , " said Jesus , " does God take counsel from his servants ? Your mission is ended , as is that of Cestus and Dysmas , for your cause speaks more of your own natures than it does of God . " Some lingering awe of the miracle worker still clung to the crowd , but when they defied the Christ and were left unsmitten , they echoed the cries of bar-Abbas . " If you are not our King , stand not then in the King 's way . " Jesus gave them a wrathful eye . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool for whom you shall suffer disasters , which I see now you richly deserve . " If not for bar-Abbas the crowd might have fallen away . But barAbbasseemed intent now on thoroughly discrediting a leader he had never given more than lip service . " Bar-Abbas , bar-Abbas , " the crowd shouted , and I marveled anew at the stupidity of man . Jesus gave them a withering look . " There is no reason for the Son of Man to receive better of you than Moses received . Moses gave you the law , but none of you keep it . I have done one work , and you marvel . And then you ask for another work , for your hearts are closed to understanding God . " " We understand , " said bar-Abbas boldly , " that you will do nothing about the Romans while our people hang from the trees because they refuse tribute to Rome . We expected a Maccabean , and we have a soothsayer . " " You see what you want to see , " said Jesus , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bar-Abbas ' body shook with emotion . " You come to save Israel and yet lift not a hand in its defense . " Jesus ' hands were calmly folded in front of him . " You have your generals and your lieutenants , your bands of armed men , why ask this of me ? " " Without the Messiah , they have no faith to stand up against the myth of Roman invincibility. "  |p234Jesus  gave him a mocking look . " And so you would manufacturea Messiah if you have none . " Bar-Abbas started as his half-forgotten words were flung back at him . But he soon recovered . " Pilate massacred your Galileans , and yet you have no reproach , but say render unto Caesar what is Caesar 's . " " And what is Casesar 's , any more than yours , or this man 's or that 's ? It is all of God , and he is the same God for all . " Bar-Abbas flushed angrily . " You hold yourself greater than Moses , but Moses led his people against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you say when the Romans smite us , turn the other cheek . How many battles will be won thus ? How many hearts are shattered in a land once filled with hope and now cast down ? " Jesus silenced the applauding crowd with a glance . " You speak of Moses , but you forget the warning to a generation no better than this : " Because you served not the Lord your God with joyousness , and with gladness of heart , therefore shall you serve your enemies which the Lord shall send against you , and he shall put a yoke of iron upon your neck , until he has destroyed you . He shall bring a nation against you from afar , as swift as the eagle flies , a nation whose tongue you shall not understand . A nation of fierce countenance , which shall not regard the person of the old , nor show favor to the young , and he shall eat the fruit of your cattle and the fruit of your land until you be destroyed . ' " He paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is here , sent by God . " He cast his eyes over the assembly . " And just as this generation is paying for the sins of the other , so will future generations suffer for the transgressions here today . " Many looked abashed . But bar-Abbas was undaunted . " So you would have us believe that the Romans are the scourge of God and their shackles should be worn gracefully around our necks like a string of pearls . But why should God so persecute his own people ? " Jesus ' eyes flashed . " Because you are hypocrites . You honor Godp235with your lips , but not your hearts . And in future times you and your children will pay a bitter price for closing your hearts to salvation and the promise of eternity . " " Words , words , words , " cried bar-Abbas . The fickle crowd had responded to bar-Abbas , for , not being for Jesus , they were now against him . Jesus measured them with a discerning eye . " Of whom much is expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-pectations . " Here and there a cry rose again in the crowd : " What can one expect of a Nazarene ? " Another cried : " He calls himself the Son of David , and yet where is his father ? " Zelotes and the others bristled , but Jesus restrained them with a look . " I know my Father , and my Father knows me . That is enough for now . " The change in bar-Abbas was not altogether surprising . He had always shown his reservations about Jesus , not acknowledging any more authority for him than he was capable of seizing . " Unless you show yourself to be the Messiah , " he cried , " you are no different from other men . " How absurd , when we had all witnessed what Jesus could do . But there was a single-mindedness about bar-Abbas which , while laudable in some ways , blocked him from the truth . He was obsessedby one thought , a liberated land , or so it seemed at the time . Yet there was something about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been plain that Jesus was our only hope . Jesus , I could see , eyed him with the contempt he usually reserved for the Temple parasites . " The seeds of your own destruction are in you , bar-Abbas , " he cried . The renegade flinched , and then his customary bravado asserted itself . " And in you as well , for he who does not resist tyranny shall succumb to it . "  | " You mock the Kingdom of Heaven , and it is well . For you shall never enter it but will live in the hell of your own treachery . You are not only false to me but to God . And though you gain your ends , you shall lose salvation . " Bar-Abbas seemed like a man stunned . But shaking himself , he turned scornfully on his heel , taking Cestus and Dysmas and many others with him . " Israel , " he cried , " shall remember us long after this false prophet is forgotten . " Others drifted off with the crowd until none was left but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you also go away ? " Simon Peter spoke up plaintively : " Where shall we go and to whom ? For you are the Anointed , the Son of the living God , with whose descent from heaven has been established eternal life . " Jesus ' face became radiant . " Bless you , Peter , for what you said came from the living God , because it could not have come from any man . For your faith , you shall abide forever in the hearts of men . And fear not , you shall leave this earth like the Son of Man . " And Peter rejoiced , for what was better than to do what Jesus did ?  |p237UNLIKE  THE BAPTIST , Jesus was not a simple man . His behavior was never predictable . He could show the worst sinner mercy , then with the cords of his robe flog the money changersunmercifully . He had a deep sense of his own worth . " If I care not for myself , " he said , " then I show no regard for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his views to the multitude , and whenever I brought up the subject of Rome and its tyranny he would smile and say , mysteriously , that without Rome there could he no spreading of the gospel . " My Father sent me at a time when all roads lead to Rome , and then out of it . " Matthew , who had become quite a scrivener , pretended to understand , but to me it was all confusing . What had the Romans to do in their black paganism with t he ( ; od of Israel ?  |p238He  seemed resigned that the bulk of the people did not understand his mission , and , for that matter , I could not comprehend myself why it was not possible to bring salvation and at the same time throw the Romans out of the country . How did one negate the other ? In their travels , he enjoined the Twelve to endure no insults but to put an ungrateful community behind them . " Cast not holy water to the dogs , nor pearls before the swine , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would not see . He enjoyed the good things of life and found pleasure when Martha and Mary Magdalen took turns in rubbing his weary frame with the soothing lotions they had acquired for this occasion . It made his visits to Lazarus ' home in Bethany a gala affair . His friendship with Lazarus intrigued me , for on the surface there was not that much to commend him to the Master . They spoke frankly , however , and Lazarus expressed the views of the business people , who were more concerned with the pacification of the land than with rebellion , for in a time of chaos and confusion they could not prosper . " My people are content , " said Lazarus , speaking of the hundreds who toiled in his many groves and wineries . " I pay them well and they work well . " He paid Lazarus the tribute of speaking to him in the third person . " Lazarus , " he said , " is a good man , for he knows that the laborer is worthy of his hire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits that ensue from the sweat of their brows . He is an example for others , and he will one day find an easy road to heaven on the arms of the many he has helped . " In no way did he begrudge Lazarus his success , nor was he disappointedwhen this friend did not leave his business to join the disciples . " They also serve God , " said he , " who make the way easier for his servants . " We questioned him closely when he observed that it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God . Matthew was particularly concerned ,  |p239for  he could not understand how Jesus could love so much his dear friend Lazarus . And what of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus , who believed in him and contributed to our cause without stint ? How else would we have alms for the poor ( or weapons for the revolution ) ? He made no distinction , said he , between people of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult for the rich to qualify for the Kingdom of Heaven , since their temptationswere greater than those of the poor . " It is not because they are rich that they are proscribed , but because of how they gained these riches and what they do with them . " He held out two coins , the silver shekel of Israel and the golden shekel of Rome . " See you any harm in these innocent pieces of metal ? Give them to the poor , or build with them a modest home or farm or road , and they are beneficent and good . " He gave me a searching glance . " Buy with them weapons , or build vast ornate temples in the name of God , and you break God 's commandmentthat there shall be no other before him . " His eyes clouded over for a moment . " Riches can free a man or make him a slave . And no man can serve two masters . " Peter looked to Mark , his handpicked disciple , who transcribed his own observations , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Master , would you give us an example of the deeper significanceof riches and poverty , in view of what you preach ? " Jesus liked nothing better than to prove a point with one of his parables . " As you will . " He squinted slightly into the fire . " There was a certain rich man , named bar-Abbas "  --  we all laughed , for everyone knew that Joshua-bar-Abbas was as poor as a mouse  --  " who was clothed in the merchant 's purple cloak and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day . On the other hand , there was a certain beggar named Lazarus "  --  we again laughed at what we bought a mere jest  --  " who , having no place to go , camped at the rich man 's gate , because he was tired and hungry and full of sores . He was happy to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man 's table . Moreover , the merchant 's dogs came and licked his sores till the pain cased . It was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did not once complain , for he felt that Godp240had visited these tribulations on him for a reason . Now it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by God 's angels into Abraham 's bosom . The rich man , who never thought of God in his devotion to riches , also died , and was buried in a grand sepulcher . " But in death he found himself , unexpectedly , in the hell he had never known on earth . In his torment he raised up his eyes and there saw at a distance the patriarch Abraham , and clasped to Abraham 's bosom was the miserable beggar Lazarus . " At this , bar-Abbas lifted his voice and cried : Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , whom I allowed my dogs to lick , that he may dip the tip of his finger in the water and cool my tongue , for I am sorely tormented by the flames of hell . ' " But Abraham only shook his head and said : Son of Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you did nothing with for the people , and likewise Lazarus suffered many things , through no apparent fault of his own , but now a balance is established and he is comforted and you are tormented . ' " Jesus looked up to see how we were responding to his story . I was particularly fascinated , for , as a Pharisee-bred , I had long considered the prospect of reincarnation and the evening of scores by one 's behavior from one life to another . Matthew , too , had been listening avidly , rueing the darkness that delayed his putting the Master 's words on parchment . The Master was pleased at our interest , and continued with this tale dear to his heart . Abraham , as it were , had even sorrier tidings for the rich man who had missed his opportunities to do good with his wealth . " And beside all this torment of hell , there is a great gulf between us , so that none can pass from heaven to hell , and neither can they pass from hell to heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I plead , Father Abraham , that you send this Lazarus , who is now in heaven , to my father 's earthly house , for I have five brothers , and I would have him testify unto them , so that they may be spared the torment of this blazing hell . " Abraham ( whom I suspected was Jesus ) shook his head vigor/ously . " They have Moses and the Prophets to follow from childhood . Let them listen to them while there is yet time . " But Lazarus was only the more insistent . " Nay , Father Abraham , " he said , " for it would count more if one came to them from the dead and gave testimony , for then they would surely repent . " " If they hear not Moses and the Prophets , " said Abraham , " neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead and spelled out their sins to them . " No one could have escaped the full brunt of this parable save Peter . " But , Master , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor man Lazarus , and the rich Joshua-bar-Abbas , when all know these roles are reversed on earth ? " " Exactly , " said Jesus , " for the unfruitful rich shall suffer the pangs of the poor , and the deserving poor the consolations of the rich in this life that extends into infinity . " The disciple Mark , the son of a rich man who frequently befriendedour cause , appeared to be troubled . " What is it ? " inquired Jesus softly , mindful always of the young . Mark 's blue eyes were somber . " Will the rich man linger always in hell and the beggar in paradise ? " " Not so , " said Jesus , " for when the lesson is learned , when the rich man accepts the word of the Father as given by the Son , then he too shall find redemption and return to a new life . " The important thing was to know the truth . But what was truth ? Jesus spoke of it often . It was not some vague philosophical concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's life . And yet truth for one man was not necessarily truth for another . The Romans thought theirs the true way . It showed in their smug smiles and swaggering walk . They had brought peace to the world , and they even had a name for it , the Pax Romana . But it was their peace , not ours . Our truth lay in the Deliverer , theirs in whatever supported their Empire and way of life . They did n't scratch below the surface of their own sick society to see the creeping corruption which needed only a firm prod to push them beyond the abyss . For them , Palestine was but a passageway from Egypt to Syria for troops andp242supplies , and the Jews were troublesome children , to be occasionallyspanked into obedience . For the Romans , Jesus did n't exist so long as his kingdom remained a heavenly one . But he was very much aware of them . " Someday , Judah , " he chided me , " Rome shall carry God 's message to the distant corners of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under those metal helmets , the thin-lipped contempt , the unbearable arrogance , and shook my head . " It would be so simple , " I said , " if you would raise your voice but once against the authority of Rome . " " Someday you will understand , as will the world , that the Son of Man is sent to do God 's work and not to suit the whims of those who want a Messiah in their own image . Is not God 's will above man 's ? " He knew as well as I all the predictions of the coming which promised the delivery of the country from its adversaries . Why else had he come at this particular time , when the world was nearingthe end of an age and people talked darkly of the millennium ? Some said that if you walked far enough , you would fall off the earth into hell , and others said that hell was all in a man 's mind , just as was the heaven he spoke of so easily . And that all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new King . Why else had he usurped the Baptist 's place unless he was this ruler ? We already knew about the one God . We needed no new reminders . Why else had we borne persecution and captivity , the scorn of the Gentile all these years , unless God was to redeem our suffering in the name of his messenger ? He could not have come at a better time for God 's people , nor more perfectly endowed . He was not quite thirty-five , of overpowering presence , when I first met him on the banks of the Jordan , in the fifteenth year of Tiberius . There was much confusion about his birth , and some placed it in the month of Kislev , which is the Roman December . But actually it was in early Shebat , corresponding to the Roman month of March , which comes under the constellation Pisces . This was during the twenty-third year of the rule of Tiberius ' predecessor and stepfather , the corrupt Octavius Augustus , who ruled so insidi/ously that the Roman Senate kept conferring titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many had confused the prediction of the coming of a King of Kings with the unparalleled power of Octavius , sitting like a Colossusastride the three continents . But Herod the Great knew better , or he would not have ordered the Massacre of the Innocents to keep his wicked line unbroken . Jesus was well aware of the doubts that grew out of his delayed ministry . And yet it would not have been propitious , he said , for him to have come before the public at any other time . " The world , " he said , " has reached a crisis of insecurity , and this crisis brings forth the state of mind that influences the course of peoples and nations . It is not by chance my ministry begins with Pilate , for it shall also end with him . " It seemed incongruous that a petty Roman procurator 's assignmentto an obscure province ( for the Romans ) should have any bearing on the Messiah who had been Israel 's shining hope for centuries . " Not so , Judah , " said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John and Peter and Matthew and the rest have come together at this time to do in your way what Pilate does in his . " " It is all ordained then ? " " Not in the particulars , for man , with faith in God , has the opportunity to alter his direction . There are some things he can change which help him in God 's kingdom , but others are God 's will and not subject to change . " " How do we know which is God 's and which man 's ? " He smiled sadly . " That only the Son knows . But remember well "  --  he turned to John  --  " you and the others , that no man shall take my life , even though many shall be persecuted down the ages for this in my name , and their persecutors shall not be lightly forgiven . For God is not as merciful with the unjust as the just , and the keys to the kingdom do not serve those who twist the teachings of the Son . " John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he silenced him with the tender glance he seemed to reserve for this son of Zebedee . " Know this , that I have the power to lay down myp244life , and to take it up again . And for this reason my Father shall love me , because I do freely lay down what he has given me that I may take it up again , and show man his ultimate destiny . " Without his power to heal , I question whether Jesus would have continued to attract the crowds . There were few who could swallowthe idea of an afterlife , or of rebirth , without evidence . And Jesus could offer none . Only words . And so it was that when he healed a cripple or a leper with a word , many were ready to follow him and believe whatever he told them . For how else could he work these miracles but with God 's help ? He never performed a miracle without attributing it to the Father 's power . After he came down from the mountain , I asked how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruddy and his breath sweet . His teeth glistened in their whiteness . He pointed to the sky . " It is no task for my Father to make bread out of stones . When the children of Israel hungered in the desert , did it not rain manna ? And when they thirsted , the prophet Moses knocked his staff against a rock . " I often wondered why the Pharisees questioned his miracles when they cheerfully acknowledged those of Moses and Elijah , which they knew only by repute . Even when they witnessed his healings and heard firsthand testimony as to how he made the blind see and made water into wine , they would not grant that he was sent by God . " He is of the devil , " they said , disregarding the fact that he had driven the devil out of many . I thought perhaps it was his familiarity with the times , his newness , for no man was a prophet to his neighbor or friends or family . But Matthew , who now prided himself on being historian , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophets of old , " he said , " relied on nature to help them with their miracles . Moses tapped on a rock in the desert , and a hidden spring emerged . He led the people of Israel into the Red Sea , through the canal which all know they had in those times , and then a cataclysm closed the waters on the pursuing Egyptians . But Jesus does it all himself . With a word he quiets the wind and the waves , and he rids the sickp245of fevers and pestilence . In Moses ' time these were inflicted on the Egyptians directly by the Lord , who spared the people of Israel . " I found it interesting but not conclusive . " What difference where the power comes from , as long as he commands it ? " " He is too much the sorcerer for them , " said Matthew . " They would like more of the supernatural and God , and less of the man . " " Yet , " I said , " the people would have made him King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pharisees . They see their Messiah as the supreme High Priest but still a humble servant of God , yet Jesus tells them what God thinks and says . " " But he speaks the truth . " " So we think . " " So they will not accept what their eyes tell them ? " " Not entirely , for they can accept a Judean born in Bethlehem of the House of David , but not a sorcerer from Nazareth who calls himself the Son of God . " " He calls us all children of God . " " It is different when he speaks of himself . Do we speak of the Father as Abba , in the same way that children speak familiarly to their parent ? " " It matters not what anybody says , " I rejoined . " I have seen him do wonders in the Father 's name , as you have , and I am sure he can do whatever he puts his mind to . There has never been another like him , and none can touch him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demands were too great on him ? " " True , " said Matthew thoughtfully , " there has never been such a miracle worker , but who knows where his own will takes him ? I le knows us , but we do not know him . " At times the Master conjured up miracles no more incredible than his walking on water . For anybody who knows about women recognizes that they are the most devious and self-centered of creatures , ever scheming to manipulate a man to their secret desires . Never do they act without self-interest . Even my mother 's wrath was directed at me because she desired Rachel as her daughter , and not because she was concerned with my happiness . For otherwise would she not have been satisfied with my wish to remain unmarried ? But for the Master all this changed . In Mary Magdalen andp246Martha , Joanna , the wife of Chuza , who was Herod 's steward , and even Susanna , a half Jewess who was a handmaiden to Claudia Procula , the wife of Pilate , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forsake all else to follow after him and prepare his food , and that of the Twelve , and minister to his wants , which were not many . However , after a hard day 's travel , sufferingfrom the unhappy vibrations of the sick and the evil , he was grateful for the soothing ointments with which they lovingly eased his weariness . They lived purely for the pleasure of serving him . " He is the Anointed of Israel , " said Mary Magdalen , " so why should we not anoint him ? " Joanna had left Herod 's household to trail after him . But Jesus persuaded her to return , telling her that marriage was a sacred covenant when performed with the rites of the one God . She had suffered from an issue of the blood which had weakened her so much that she could hardly crawl to the oasis in Perea where she was healed merely by touching the hem of his robe . Even reunited with her spouse , she continued her service to the Master whenever we went into Perea , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she could she kept us apprised of Herod 's plans , and of Pilate 's , for they were in close correspondence . My favorite was Susanna . She was a picture of innocence , with soft blue eyes from her Macedonian father , and a shapely form that recalled Rachel 's secret charms . Unbelievably , this beautiful maid , who had already attained her peak at fifteen , had been marred with a deformed hand , the four fingers grown together from birth . But the Master had only touched her and said a few words , and the fingers had detached themselves and assumed a normal shape . She was such a delight that I longed to caress her , but I knew this would be misunderstood , for her devotion was exclusively directedto ministering to the Master , and any mark of affection from another , however innocent , might be taken amiss . The Master trusted me , for more than once he said : " I know how hard it is for you , Judah , to remain celibate , but in resisting temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my faith in you . You can not serve two masters , and the bondage to women can be a greater tyranny than any you find in Rome . "  |p247Because  of Susanna , Jesus ' fame had spread into the very householdof the Procurator , and Pilate 's wife had become fascinated by the tales her little handmaiden brought back with her , out of this interest renewing her permission for these little interludes . I had thought it conceivable that Susanna might artlessly do us harm by revealing our movements in Judea , but Jesus had only smiled at my nervousness . " Do you think for a moment that they know not where to take me ? The time is not yet ripe , for both the enemies of man and the Son of Man . But it approaches and none shall know it before you . " Amid all this uncertainty , we traveled into Galilee , then crossed the sea at Tiberias into the Decapolis , the other side of the Jordan , and found the crowds there as enthusiastic as ever . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Messiah or King of the Jews , as long as he healed and comforted them . The company of women dwindled , for it was difficult for many to leave their homes in Judea for any period , but the Magdalen , as I knew her , was always with us , insisting that her sister Martha stay at home with Lazarus . There had been some dissension over this , but Mary had prevailed , and Martha had disconsolately returned to Bethany . Joanna could not come out of Herod 's land , but Susanna brightened our days with her beauty , and there were others of nondescript quality , notable only in their wish to be of service . My relationship with Mary Magdalen was never cordial . She had resented my opposition to her anointing the Master in the Pharisee'shome , thinking it had something to do with the intimacy fostered by this act of devotion . I cared little what she thought , but for the fact that she had not only the Master 's ear but that of Susanna , who blushed prettily when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Magdalen , at twenty-one or so , was beyond the first flush of youth , and more shopworn than most . She had been forgiven much but could not herself forgive those who remembered her calling . And how did one forget , since her presence was a constant reminder ? She taxed me once with calling her by a vile name . I pleaded my innocence immediately . " I do not know what you are talking about . "  |p248She  gave me a scathing look . " You know well enough , Judas . " She insisted on the Greek form of my name , knowing it annoyed me . I shook my head , and would have been off , but she threw out a hand to detain me . " You called me a prostitute . " I looked at her in pity . " If it is wrong to call a bricklayer a bricklayer and a lawyer a lawyer , then I wronged you . I was only telling somebody how the Master took the devil out of you . Should I have called you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In her anger she bared her teeth . " I know your sly ways , and have warned the Master . " " You can do me no harm , for I love him . " " What do you know of love ? " She almost snarled the words . " You stay with him for one reason , and all know it , hoping that he will lead your petty little army of ragamuffins against Rome . Let him satisfy you , just once , that he marches to a different tune , and you will run off to a new master . " She pointed an accusing finger at me . " I know you , Judas , you can not deceive me , for I have learned in a hard school to look on people as they are . " I felt myself turning cold inside . " You can do me no damage . I am one of the Twelve , handpickedby him , and sit next to him in the fellowship of our councils . Only Peter takes precedence over me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nothing , or less than nothing . " I had not been so infuriated since Rachel sought to trick me into marriage . " You would do well , " I said , " to stay home with your brother and send Martha in your stead . She knows what it is to respect an Apostle . " " You command no respect from me . Think not that I am unaware of the eyes you have for that child Susanna . Have you not heard the Master say that whoever looks at a woman with lust in his eyes has already committed adultery with her in his heart ? " " She is woman enough to know her mind . "  | " And you are man enough to know the vows you have made . " " There was no oath taken . " She laughed with such scorn that I could cheerfully have slapped her face . " You must be deaf . Has not Jesus said that whoever offends these simple souls who believe in him shall be worse off than if he had a millstone around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened enough . " I must speak to Andrew about your breaking into our camp whenever you please . " " I do so at the Master 's invitation and care not a fig what any man says . Save for John , and perhaps Andrew , there is none good enough to kiss his feet . " I did not fret over her . For the Master never listened to gossip . He called it a coward 's way of stabbing his adversary in the back . Nevertheless , I was relieved when word came from Martha that her sister was needed at home to help nurse their ailing brother . Jesus became grave when told of the illness , for he loved Lazarus for his good nature and hospitality . Mary was troubled more , I was sure , by leaving the Master than by her brother 's malady . " Will you come if we need you , Master ? " she pleaded . He looked at the multitude appealing to him for help . " I can not come now , " he said , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glancing back wistfully over her shoulder , she trudged off to the south , but not without making amends for the contemptible way she had treated me . " Forgive me , " she said , " for not behaving toward you as the Master would have me behave toward all persons . The Twelve are as dear to us as our own . " And so I forgave her , for her sake and the Master 's . I saw no more of Susanna at this time , for the Master had mysteriouslysent her back to Jerusalem . When I inquired after her , he only shrugged . So I asked : " Is she not with us because they learn our movements through her ? "
