In a mood of restrained jubilation and cautious hope , Indian , Pakistani and Bangladesh officials settled down last week to tackle the immense logistical problems posed by a new peace settlement that affects the whole subcontinent . After 19 days of hard bargaining in Islamabad and New Delhi , India and Pakistan agreed-with Bangladesh concurrence-that 1 ) 90,000 Pakistani military and civilian prisoners of war who have been held captive in India since the end of the December 1971 Indo-Pakistani war will be sent home ; 2 ) an estimated 200,000 Bengalis stranded in Pakistan at war 's end will be allowed to return to Bangladesh ; 3 ) " a substantial number " of Biharis ( non-Bengali Moslems ) in Bangladesh will be repatriated to Pakistan . <P> Although the agreement resolves the most important problems left over from the war , certain key details remain to be ironed out . Under the terms of the agreement , Islamabad and Dacca-after the simultaneous repatriation of detainees is completed-will enter into direct negotiations on the fate of 195 ranking Pakistani P.O.W.s that Bangladesh wants to try for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the question is settled . <P> It is also uncertain how many Biharis , many of whom were partisans of the Pakistani forces during the war and as a result face a bleak future in Bangladesh , will be allowed to go to Pakistan . The initial exchange is estimated to involve about 80,000 , although Bangladesh has said that as many as 250,000 Biharis have indicated a desire to be repatriated . <P> Even under the best of circumstances , the mass migration would be no easy task for the three countries to arrange . Indian transport officials estimate that nearly 100 trains will be required to empty the 50 P.O.W. camps . <P> Complicating the return of the prisoners is the fact that both India and Pakistan in recent weeks have been ravaged by the worst floods in decades . Rail traffic has been disrupted , bridges have been washed away and highways made impassable . Because of the distances involved , the Bengalis and Biharis will have to be transported by sea and airlifts . The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10,000,000 Bengali refugees who fled to India during the war , will very likely oversee the exchange . Substantial funds will be required , however , and U.N . Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim is expected to make a world appeal for aid . <P> Some diplomatic critics have pointed out that the agreement contained nothing that could not have been worked out a year ago . But Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , who held the weakest cards , felt it necessary to shore up his own political foundations at home before risking domestic disfavor by dealing with his country 's enemies . In the end , he acquiesced almost totally to a joint proposal offered last April by India and Bangladesh .
