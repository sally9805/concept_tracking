On the 40-mile stretch of highway between Ann Arbor and Detroit , even housewives in curlers pretend they are Mario Andretti . But one morning last week drivers revving up for the dash to Detroit found all lanes blocked by a trio of cars traveling abreast at 55 m.p.h. , the legal speed limit . Behind the wheels were Stephen W. Long , Elizabeth Ann Lipski and Bruce Nielson , three friends who had taken it upon themselves to enforce the law . Their cars were decorated with signs reading GAS SHORTAGE and STAY ALIVE AT 55 . <P> The vigilantes of Interstate 94 almost produced the opposite effect . As traffic backed up , drivers risked life and fender to pass the righteous threesome , climbing embankments and zooming along the shoulders . Once in front of their tormentors , some irate motorists immediately slowed to about 15 m.p.h. out of spite . " One semitrailer slammed on his brakes so fast he blew out a tire . I was lucky I did n't crash into him , " recalled Lipski . " People got violent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they did . " When the procession reached Detroit it stretched half a mile or more and numbered some 600 cars . There was nothing illegal about what had happened . En route back to Ann Arbor , however , Lipski and Long were arrested for going too slowly in a 45 m.p.h. minimum speed zone . The charge : reckless driving .
