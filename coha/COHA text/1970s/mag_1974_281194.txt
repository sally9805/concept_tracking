Of all possible conditions , the one that businessmen most abhor is uncertainty . Yet as the U.S. economy lumbers out of one of its most profitable , troublesome and portentous years , uncertainty is the only word for the outlook . In trying to gauge prospects for 1974 , most economists admit to playing a kind of blindman 's buff . The biggest imponderable is the extent of the damage likely to result from the energy crisis , which is sure to bring something that economists have no experience charting : a slowdown caused not by lack of demand but by shortage of supply . <P> As always , economists are making predictions anyway . The general forecast for 1974 is glum : headlong inflation and a marked slowing in production , jobs , income and profits . It all adds up to a mild recession or something close to it in the first six months , with some quickening of the economic pulse thereafter . Even this lackluster prediction is hedged with qualifications because , as the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. circumspectly notes : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal wider than it has been in a long , long time . " <P> Much of the caution stems from a recognition that something momentous happened last year : after a long period of almost splendid isolation , the U.S. economy joined the rest of the world . As a result , the nation had to cope with events over which it had only partial control . <P> By far the most critical outside influence on the economy was the Arab states ' decision to cut off the flow of oil to the U.S. because of its support of Israel . That move transformed a difficult situation into an emergency . Even before the Arab action , Americans faced scarcities of fuel . If the ban were lifted tomorrow , the U.S. would have to struggle with energy shortages for years . <P> Rising Prices . The full impact of the oil cutback is still unclear , though there is general agreement that the economy eventually will adjust and continue to grow , despite its reduced energy diet , largely because businessmen and consumers will be forced to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the petroleum shortfall will be less than the thoroughly disruptive 3.4 million bbl. per day originally anticipated . Still , the jittery psychological climate created by the threat has enabled oil-exporting countries to raise their prices to towering new levels , and that will further fuel raging inflation in all industrialized nations . Says Walter Heller , a member of TIME 'S Board of Economists and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson : " The economy in 1974 will be terribly sensitive to things we do n't know much about .
