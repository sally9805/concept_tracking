The monthly meetings of the E.I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co. board , nine of whose 24 members reside in the House of Du Pont through bloodline or marriage , tend to be family as well as corporate councils . At last week 's session , family scandal and a series of reverses in the company 's fortunes combined to cause change at the top of the world 's largest chemical manufacturer . At the ever-so-gentle hinting of other Du Fonts , Chairman Lammot du Pont Copeland Sr. , 65 , declined to stand for re-election and also stepped down from the finance committee. *His duties were added to those already held by Charles Brelsford ( " Brel " ) McCoy , 62 , who succeeded Copeland as president in 1967 . <P> Dizzying Empire . Copeland moved out , a Du Pont spokesman said , " because personal affairs are taking more and more of his time . " Six months ago , his 38-year-old son Lammot ( " Motsey " ) du Pont Copeland Jr . petitioned for one of the most spectacular personal bankruptcies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liabilities totaling $55 million . The younger Copeland 's chief business associate , Lebanese-born Thomas A. Shaheen Jr. , has been indicted by a Chicago grand jury on charges of receiving kickbacks on loans from the barbers ' union pension fund and others . Much of the money allegedly went to shore up a dizzying business empire assembled by Copeland and Shaheen . In a related matter , Motsey has been charged with conspiracy , though he testified that he was frequently not aware of what associates did with his funds . <P> The son 's follies are being visited on the father in more ways than one . The senior Copeland guaranteed about $8.2 million in loans to his son and his enterprises , all of which are now bankrupt or in deep financial trouble . Copeland holds a lien on Lammot Jr . ' s real property , including a $500,000 home , making it unavailable to other creditors . Copeland 's financial worries have been further complicated by the near failure of a family-connected stock brokerage , Francis I. du Pont &; Co . Various family members and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles cost them at least $6 million ( see following story ) . <P> Expensive Failures . Besides his family problems , Copeland faced a good deal of corporate discouragement . Under his leadership , Du Pont suffered a serious erosion of its pre-eminence in chemicals , even though the company is still the biggest in the field ( 1970 sales : $3.6 billion ) . Du Pont leaders have long dreamed of producing " another nylon , " but the company has introduced few notably profitable products in the past decade . Several that did appear turned out to be expensive failures . Corfam , the synthetic leather , is being phased out after an investment of $100 million . Other disappointments : an antiflu pill called Symmetrel and a venture into the production of photo film . Last week the board announced a decline in earnings from $93 million in the first quarter of 1970 to $74 million in the equivalent period this year .
