GLORY by VLADIMIR NABOKOV 205 pages . McGraw-Hill. $6.95 . <P> Of Nabokov 's nine emigre novels , written in Russian mostly during the ' 20s and ' 30s , this is the last to be published in English . One regrets at once that there will not be more . Though a brand-new novel is promised for late this year , it will not be prefaced by the thunderbolt from Montreux , which has become customary in these translations , in which the author instructs his Johnny-come-lately audience in his older works . <P> Nabokov has become shameless in his attempts to control ( and bamboozle ) readers in these introductions . This time , without naming him , he gives particular hell to Critic Andrew Field - " a desperate saphead in the throes of a nightmare examination " - who had the effrontery to read Glory in Russian and beat the author to a published criticism . <P> The result is that one embarks upon this gossamer fiction with a head stuffed full of what it does not mean . No , Field notwithstanding , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-eclipse by his parents ' early separation . No , there is no connection between Glory 's dream world of Zoorland and Pale Fire 's Zembla . Though the author admits that Martin might be " a distant cousin with whom I share certain childhood memories , " one is enjoined against " flipping through Speak , Memory Nabokov 's autobiography in quest of duplicate items . " Instead , the dutiful reader - always feeling vaguely inferior to the ideal Russian reader-is urged to concentrate on " the echoing and linking of minor events , in back-and-forth switches , which produce an illusion of impetus : in an old daydream . " <P> Martin , who owes his flowery last name to a Swiss grandfather , is a dreamy Russian youth who is pried from his comfortable calendar of winters in St. Petersburg and vacations in the Crimea by the 1918 revolution . He emigrates via Yalta to Greece , Switzerland , and England , where he eventually studies at Cambridge . There he is overwhelmed both by unrequited love for a bitchy girl named Sonia Zilanov and by seductive images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of memory . " <P> One day when Sonia is behaving less churlishly than usual , she and Martin dream up a northern place called Zoorland . Abruptly , Martin embraces the imaginary country as his homeland and is last seen embarking on a trip across its borders . Unfortunately , Zoorland 's physical equivalent is the Soviet Union , where the balmy pilgrim will almost certainly be shot as a spy . But his disappearance hardly seems tragic , for he is so patently a repository of memory and romance . Indeed , one of his earliest temptations is to step into a picture in his Crimean bedroom showing a path that disappears into a wood . He is very much like one of Nabokov 's most delightful creations , Art Longwood of the poem " Ballad of Longwood Glen , " who climbs a tree and simply disappears .
