 | How Good Is Your Child 's School ? @# FOUR YEARS and 50,000 miles ago , I , a veteran teacher and mother of four school-age sons , began to learn what good schools should be like . On a commission from the Carnegie Corporation , I visited classrooms on three continents , * and I think I can finally answer all the parents who have been asking , " How can I tell if my child 's school is doing a good job ? What should I look for ? " I believe I can also reply to the parents who add , " And how can I make things better ? " The first thing you may have to do is to scrap some of your notions , as I did . I was halfway through my travels , for example , before I could admit that small classes are n't as es ? sential as I had always insisted . In fact , some of the best schools I visited had 40 children to one teacher ! Modern buildings are n't essential , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish my sons could attend , and other , up-tothe-minute ones containing all the things that matter least and few of those that matter most . So do n't worry if your school does n't have a television set in every room ? and do n't be unduly impressed if it does . There are only three requirements for a good elementary school : a pleasant atmosphere where every child can feel valued and successful ; a faculty concerned with developing youngsters who delight in learning ; and programs that respond to each child 's individual needs . Let 's visit a school together , so you 'll know how to spot the clues that tell LADIES NOME JOURNAL ( FEBRUARY ' 71 ) , 1971 BY D0WNE a BLISHING , INC. , 641 LEXINGTON AVE. , NEW YORK , N.Y . 10022  | you if the combination is working . You 'll get your first inkling in the schoolyard as the children arrive . Do they enter the building freely , or must they line up like soldiers waiting for drill orders ? If we see youngsters locked out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other signs of an insensitive school . Does a pleasant atmosphere reallymatter ? I am convinced it does , for if a child 's early experiences are distasteful , he may decide that learning , like medicine , is only to be taken in small doses . I can say flatly that I have never seen a good school within a harsh environment . We 'll find our next clue in the hallways . Bare walls suggest a school at is barren in other ways , too . Good schools typically burst with paintings , posters and murals because the people who run them know that children are creative creatures whose talents and love of beauty will grow , if properly nurtured . They also know that children in express feelings through art which they may not yet be able to ut into words . Even the least able tudent feels successful when he sees is painting on display . Art , in sum , is essential to a good elementary school . Learning vs . Memorizing . A visit to the principal 's office is especially important , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views himself as an administrator , wrapped up in lunch schedules and absence notes ( clerical jobs , anyway ) , the school may be efficient , but do n't expect much more . But if he views himself as an educator ? a teacher of teachers and children ? chances 111111 are he runs a good school . Ask him about his goals ? plain English for " educational philosophy . " If he replies with the curriculum he wants " covered , " grade by grade , you 're not talking with an educator ; if he talks about the attitudes and abilities he tries to foster in his children , you probably are , for educators know that how a child learns may be as important as what he learns . Repeating what teacher and textbooks say is one thing ; having the initiative to explore new areas independently is quite another . The first is memorizing ; the second , learning . It 's important not to confuse the two . While we 're in the office , let 's ask to see a sample report card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards have a category called " Ability to Follow Directions . " Good schools are likely to have categories like " Intellectual Curiosity " and " Resourcefulness " as well . Has yours ? Let 's also ask to see school-wide scores on standardized reading and math tests to compare with national norms . If the achievement is low , we 'll want to know why ; if it 's above average , we 'll want to understand how the school achieved success . But remember , children who come from homes that surround them with books , magazines and dinnertable conversation should score high- er . Something 's wrong if they do n't . Remember , too , that reading scores only tell you about competence . You 'll also want to know about reading enjoyment . Since we 'll make most of our discoveries in the classroom , let 's visit as many as we can . ( Most good schools welcome classroom visitors . ) Notice if the teacher greets us as we enter , or pretends that we are phantoms , silent and invisible . Notice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not daring to let their eyes meet ours . Such things can indicate a tense , unnatural environment where normal sociability is forbidden . Listen to the sounds of the room . In a good classroom you may hear laughter and squeals of delight as children suddenly grasp a new idea or make an unexpected discovery ; you may hear groans of disappointment if an experiment does n't work out . And you may hear conversation as children help one another . But you wo n't find long periods of silence , except during a test . Nor will you hear the teacher doing 70 to 8o percent of the talking ( which is about average , according to many research studies ) . Individualizing the Program . As you listen , count the number of times the teacher says " no " or employs an equivalent put-down . " No wonder half my class never volunteers , " a young teacher confessed after hearing herself on a tape recording she had made during class . " I 've crushed them ! " The best teacher I ever saw spent an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though her Mexican-American youngsters need ed many corrections because they had not yet mastered the English language . Time and again , this teacher found ways of accepting some part of a child 's answer and building from there . And she found something to praise in every child , even if it was no more than " Paul has been so helpful today . " Be alert also to what happens if child gives a correct answer which does n't happen to be the one the teacher wanted . Does the teacher brush it aside because she is determined to follow the lesson plan ? Or does she accept the unexpected learning opportunity ? Take a look around the room You 'll notice that one student has zipped through six pages in his math workbook , while the boy sitting next to him is still struggling with the first page . Another child , biting her nails , is frantically trying to catch up because she was absent when her class learned long division , Unusual circumstances ? Definitely not . There 's not a classroom in America where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school separates children into " abili ity groups , " there are wide differences in performance . Consequently , a good school find ways of individualizing the program . In at least a thousand American classrooms ( with North Dakota*  | and Vermont leading the way ) , the teacher no longer instructs the entire class as a unit . Instead , students work individually or in small groups , according to their interests and skills , while the teacher circulates about the room , helping a few children at a time . In the same class , Sally may still be learning to write simple sentences , while Jill is already composing stories . Neither has to be skipped or left back . Any child who has been absent simply picks up where he left off . The Trouble With Gold Stars . But even if we are visiting a more conventional classroom , we can still look for clues which tell us that each child is regarded as a distinct individual . Notice the books . Is there only one set of readers , riveting every youngster to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good third-grade room , for example , should have primers and sixthgrade readers , as well as all stops in between . We can often form a hunch about whether children enjoy reading by watching what happens when the teacher steps into the hall to talk with us . Do they sit numbly , waiting for her to return and redirect them ? Or do they seize the opportunity to read ? Notice , too , if a child is ever so engrossed in his work that he skips recess or lingers late . Many classrooms have a gold-star chart . Too many , for the stars are not merely a way of rewarding the successful but also a way of labeling the failures , and we know that the child who senses that he has been labeled a failure often proceeds to live up to that expectation . Good schools provide ways for every child to feel successful . I still remember the reply that a New York City principal gave me when I commented that her school had achieved the district 's highest reading scores . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores indicate that we 're doing a good job in an essential area . But I 'm also delighted that our children won top prizes in Harlem Hospital 's art show and in the city-wide garden contest . And I 'm thrilled with the Negro History Museum they assembled . " She went on to express pleasure over the grace and skill that her sixth-grade boys had displayed in a recent karate exhibit , and wound up inviting me to a forthcoming musical for which the children had made the scenery and sewn the costumes . Clearly , success in her school is not limited to paperand-pencil achievement . You Can Make a Difference . No school is likely to measure up in every way , of course . But every school can be helped to do a better job . You can begin by getting to know your child 's school well ; do n't limit your visits to one or two classrooms on Open School Day . Because there is something worthwhile in every school , you would do well to compliment people on what does please you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most . Begin with a problem to which  | you see a solution ? preferably an inexpensive one so that you wo n't be rebuffed with " That 's a fine idea , but we have n't the money . " Some school administrators believe that nothing can be changed without large expenditures , which simply is n't so . I think of one mother , for example , who was distressed when she visited school and discovered that the children , by and large , did not enjoy reading . But she also discovered a small , unused library housed in a musty supply room ; the school 's part-time librarian had been the victim of a budget cut . When she asked the principal if the school could n't reopen its library , he offered no encouragement , but neither did he deny permission . Undaunted , this mother enlisted eight more parents to scrub and paint the room , and to arrange the books in tempting displays . Then she lined up other mothers to serve as librarians and story readers each afternoon . Predictably , children started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As you spend more time in your child 's school , you will get to know the principal and teachers better , which frees you to question r things . Why do n't the lower gr have music ? Why does n't the se studies program include pre . day concerns ? Why must child walk through halls in silent lin You may discover that once per start thinking about things they h always taken for granted , you sta some chance of effecting change . If you want to bring about maj reform , however , you 'll have to to school-board meetings . The sch board does the hiring and firin sets the budget , and makes count less decisions that either free a hamstring your school . At a tin when government has become in creasingly removed from the people control of the schools still remain a local matter . You can be heard a your school-board meetings .
