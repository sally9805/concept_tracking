It was billed as a " celebration of life , " but the Louisiana rock festival near the town of McCrea may have marked the end of what began at Woodstock as a beatific American experience and deteriorated into something violent at Altamont and vapid at Powder Ridge . Last week 's festival , which lasted only four days instead of the announced eight , was an American nightmare . To begin with , the festival was postponed for three days while the promoters wallowed in legal mire . The kids amused themselves by making human mud pies and bathing in the nude . Two youths drowned in the fast-rushing Atchafalaya River . State undercover narcotics agents circulated in the crowd and made more than 100 busts . One youth died in a hospital tent from a drug overdose . Meanwhile , dazed with blistering heat , and stultifying humidity , the estimated 50,000 youths who gathered to see Country Joe McDonald and John Sebastian were also choked by dust . For the Woodstock Nation , McCrea was a bleak experience of mud , sweat and tears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
