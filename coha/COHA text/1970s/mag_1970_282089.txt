THE LOSS OF EL DORADO by V.S. Naipaul. 335 pages . Knopf. $7.50 . <P> <P> Shortly before Venezuela 's Orinoco River reaches the Atlantic , it blossoms into estuaries . Just above them on the map , like a bee frozen over a skeletal rose , is Trinidad-an island with a history of frustrated dreams . <P> To the latter-day Spanish conquistador Antonio de Berrio , Trinidad was a staging point for futile Orinoco expeditions in search of El Dorado , the mythical city of gold . To Berrio 's English rival , Sir Walter Raleigh , Trinidad was to be the beginning of a South American empire , where Indians and true-born Englishmen would unite to destroy the power of Spain . In his excessively romantic chronicle , The Discovery of the Large , Rich and Beautiful Empire of Guiana , Raleigh describes an Arcadia whose wealth and spaciousness would give new dimension to Renaissance European man . <P> No one ever found El Dorado . And Raleigh 's dream of a New World foundered on the crass realities of exploitation .

French migrs from Guadaloupe and Martinique came to Trinidad with slaves and a system of savage punishment . Blacks had their noses split and their ears slashed off for minor offenses . Hangings , quarterings and decapitations were common occurrences . A simple method of extracting information was to truss up a suspect in a particularly unnatural position and then suspend him so that his weight was supported where the ball of his foot met a wooden stake . <P> In 1801 , Trinidad 's Governor Thomas Picton applied the torture to a young mulatto girl who had been implicated in a theft .
