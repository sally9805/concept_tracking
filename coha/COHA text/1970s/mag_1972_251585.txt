" The night before my announcement a dream came to me that the Asian problem was becoming extremely explosive , and that God was directing me to act immediately to save the situation . " Thus last week Uganda 's mercurial President , General Idi ( " Big Daddy " ) Amin , explained his draconian edict : some 60,000 Asians-principally those from the Indian subcontinent who hold British passports-must quit the country within 90 days . <P> The expulsion order came as no great surprise to Uganda 's Asians , long the target of Amin 's criticism as he sought to win support by stirring up antagonism against them among the country 's 9.4 million blacks . Now he charged that the Asians were " economic saboteurs , " engaged in smuggling , black marketeering , " encouraging corruption , " running monopolies and currency frauds . " They only milked the cow ; they did not feed it , " he said . He decreed that businesses belonging to the expelled Asians will be turned over to Uganda 's black citizens . Any Asians who stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sitting in the fire . " <P> <P> Amin 's rather wild-eyed proclamation was the latest explosion of enmity between East Africa 's blacks and Asian immigrants , many of whom were similarly driven out of Kenya in 1967 . Large numbers of Asians arrived in East Africa at the turn of the century to help build a railway inland from the port of Mombasa . By the time Uganda was granted independence by the British in 1962 , the Asians , who were better educated and more enterprising than the majority of the Africans with whom they dealt , ran four out of five businesses in the country , and had monopolized the important coffee and cotton industries . Black Ugandans resented both the Asians ' economic dominance and their social exclusiveness . Nonetheless , at least 23,000 of the estimated 90,000 Asians in Uganda in 1962 applied for Ugandan citizenship . Most of the rest retained their British passports . <P> Softened Stand . Amin 's sudden decree last week threatened to upset the strict quota system-at present 3,500 household heads , plus their dependents , per year-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Sir Alec Douglas-Home conceded Britain 's " special obligation " to those who hold British passports , but hoped that London 's duty could be fulfilled by an " orderly quota arrangement over the years . " Others were unwilling to admit any obligation at all . M.P . Ronald Bell , a member of the Tory right-wing Monday Club , issued a statement declaring that " these so-called British Asiatics are no more and no less British than any Indian in the bazaars of Bombay .
