If pigeons were as big as polar bears or as glamorous as leopards , there would be considerable growling among the watchdogs of the world 's wildlife over the slaughter of the white-crowned pigeon . But the plight of Columba leucocephala has failed to arouse even a sympathetic sniff from those who should be concerned about its extinction . And unless drastic action is taken , extinction looms as a certainty . // The signals are classic : the bird 's nesting , breeding and feeding grounds are disappearing at an alarming rate , while widespread and indiscriminate killing continues unchecked . That such signals have not served as red alerts in this era of conservation awareness , if not to ornithologists certainly to sportsmen , is as mystifying as some of the bird 's habits . // No one seems really sure of where and how the while-crowned pigeon spends its winters . To date there has never been a full-scale scientific study of the bird 's life , and the few scientists who have made private studies over the years are the first to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , the white-crowned pigeon has a snowy headdress , iridescent bronze-green neck feathers , crimson feet and maroon accents on otherwise gray plumage . It is considerably larger than the white-wing and mourning doves , measuring 13 to 14 inches in length and weighing between seven and eight ounces . Its flesh , all dark meat , is sweet-flavored and tender  --  factors which have enhanced its place on the dinner table at the expense of its longevity . // A bird of the southern islands , the white-crown once ranged in vast Hocks from the Bahamas and the Florida Keys south to the Lesser Antilles , and throughout the West Indies to Mexico and Central America . Today its numbers are drastically reduced and , while it still occurs on many of the islands , the only breeding populations of any significance that remain are in the Dominican Republic , the Florida Keys , the Bahamas and possibly Cuba . // Ornithologist C. J. Maynard , in his The Birds of Eastern North America ( 1896 ) , described a nesting colony of white-crowned pigeons typical of the Bahamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the most remarkable sights that I ever witnessed as regards numbers of birds ' nests was on one of the Washerwomen Keys off the South shore of Andros . These are small , rocky islets , lying on the barrier reef , and are some 25 feet high . On one of these little keys , which did not contain over an acre of land , there were at least 10,000 nests of the white-headed pigeon . The rocks were mostly covered with a scanty growth of low bushes and with a more luxuriant growth of cacti , and upon both plants and bushes the birds had placed their nests , and some were upon elevated portions of rock , while a few were placed upon the naked ground . So completely covered was the southern and northern portion of the key that the nests were nowhere over two feet apart , and often nearer together than that . " // Other noted ornithologists of the past , including J. J. Audubon , Dr. Henry Bryant and P. H. Gosse , all reported observing similar vast breeding colonies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the branches of the royal palm , on the upper shoots of mangroves and often on clumps of brush growing in the shallows where the nests hung down almost touching the water . // All took note of the bird 's proclivity for nesting on remote keys , in dense concealing brush , factors which have probably contributed to its surviving this long . The bird 's basically shy , suspicious nature has doubtless also contributed , but other characteristics have worked against it . // To understand these , it is necessary to review what is known of the white-crown 's breeding pattern . The bird principally breeds in summer but may arrive at the nesting grounds as early as April and remain as late as October . The time it spends on the nesting grounds probably depends more upon weather and food conditions than upon the calendar . The number of hatches in a single season also seems dependent upon weather and food , and may be as few as one or as many as four . // Unlike gallinaceous birds such as the pheasant , turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white-crowned pigeon rarely if ever produces more than two . Studies made by Alexander Sprunt , director of research of the National Audubon Society , and probably the best-informed authority on the species today , indicate that from those eggs a breeding pair produces only about two young a year . Compared with the reproduction of quail , for example , pigeon reproduction is low . // The incubation period lasts 13 days , during which both parents share the responsibility of tending the eggs . Where gallinaceous birds are fully developed at birth and generally able to follow their mothers soon after they hatch , the newborn squab is quite helpless . It often remains in the nest for as long as a month after birth , depending entirely upon its parents for food . Both male and female share the feeding chores , each producing in its crop a curdlike substance called pigeon 's milk to feed the young . // It is during the breeding period , and particularly when the white-crowned pigeon has young , that it is most vulnerable . Normally it feeds in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles from the nesting site to a source of food and fresh water . Just as it needs lowland swamps and mangroves for its nesting site , the white-crowned pigeon needs hardwood forests for its food . An arboreal rather than a ground feeder , it depends upon the fruits and leaves of such trees as the sweetwood , breadnut , burnwood , fig , pimento and palm . // With no fledglings to feed , the white-crown flies in wild , erratic patterns at very high speeds , offering a target that is a challenge to even the best wing shots . But when there are young in the nest , it seems to have little time for such antics . Then the bird 's flight , although still fast , is direct and determined , its sole purpose to get to food and get back to the nest as quickly as possible . Usually it adopts a specific path and follows it as if on a radar beam , ignoring any and all threats from below . Sometimes it flies so low over water that it appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees . At these times the bird seems bent on suicide . // There is no way to estimate the hundreds of thousands of white-crowned pigeons that have been killed by guns stationed out in the open without benefit of cover or blind , directly in one of these feeding flight paths . Hundreds of thousands more have been shot from boats anchored just off one of the breeding islands , only yards from the nesting grounds . Countless others have been killed on the feeding grounds as their Kamikaze flight led them straight to the guns of shooters waiting among the trees . Most victims of such slaughter leave un-hatched eggs or young squabs to die of starvation in their nests . // The white-crown slaughter is nothing new . Maynard took note of it nearly 100 years ago : // " Sportsmen from Nassau had been in the habit of visiting Green Key and shooting the breeding pigeons as-they flew from their nests to cross to Andros Island , some 15 miles distant , where they are said to go daily for food and water . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Key contained broken eggs that contained the remains of half-formed young , and in some of the nests were the skeletons of newly hatched young ; the parents of both eggs and young had doubtless been killed as they left the nests . This sight was a most piteous appeal to humanity . I was informed by one of my boatmen , who had accompanied hunting parties to the key , that so great was the slaughter of pigeons that many more were killed than were needed , and that he had frequently seen hundreds of birds buried in the sand of the beach near where they were shot . " // Nor were shotgunners the only villains Maynard cited . Referring again to the Washerwomen Keys , he wrote : // " My boatman informed me that this rookery was occupied by many thousand birds during the past year , and that the spongers were accustomed to visit the place at night and capture the sitting birds . This statement was confirmed by the remains of torches which were scattered about the island . " // Other accounts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic  --  tell of organized beats in which natives moved systematically through breeding grounds , shaking bushes and trees until the squabs fell from their nests to the ground , where they where gathered by the thousands in bushel baskets to be used as pig feed . // It would be comforting to think that such outrages belonged only to the past , but the slaughter continues  --  the white-crowned pigeon is still being shot during its breeding season . Thousands of unhatched eggs and helpless squabs are still being left in nests with no hope of survival . Vast piles of dead birds are still rotting and decaying where they have been abandoned , victims of irresponsible hunters . And there is no indication that any of it will end until the last white-crowned pigeon has been eliminated . // Last season a number of hotels in the Bahamas had stepped up campaigns in Florida and other Southern states , advertising pigeon shoots with daily bag limits of 50 birds and possession limits of 200. // " I am really concerned about the setup there , " says U.S. Game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cheap flight from here to the islands and you can mount a lot of hunting pressure advertising limits like that . What they did n't advertise is that U.S. regulations prohibit bringing in more than 10 birds in one calendar week . That means a lot of people are going to shoot birds and let them lay . It 's a completely unrealistic waste of a fine natural resource . " // Some people try smuggling birds in , but dead pigeons are more difficult to hide than pot . The most common attempts to bring birds in illegally are by private yacht , but Switzer and the U.S. Customs staff have become old hands at ferreting out foreign feathers . Switzer has seized as many as 500 white-crowns from a single yachtsman. // Illegal birds have also been flown in . A few years ago some 150 Floridians chartered two planes for a weekend shoot and returned with 1,000 pounds of pigeons . The more than 2,500 birds had neither been plucked nor gutted and many were already spoiled when the Department of Agriculture , alerted by the odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bag limits at all on shooting white-crowned pigeons in the Dominican Republic , which regularly attracts shooters during the breeding season from Puerto Rico , Martinique , Jamaica , Florida and as far away as New York and Texas . Individuals have been known to take as many as 2,000 birds on a weekend . The new limit of 100 birds a day is not likely to do much for the pigeon population , since there are no game-law enforcement agents  --  or an effective game department  --  in the Dominican Republic and no one has been known to be arrested there for violating a game law . // The Dominican Republic is of major importance since it harbors the pigeon 's single largest breeding grounds . Accurate population counts do not exist but educated estimates indicate that the other three major colonies  --  in the Bahamas , the Florida Bay area of the Keys , and the Lower Keys  --  number less than 10,000 birds each . Estimates of white-crowns remaining in Cuba are even more pessimistic since virtually all the bird 's feeding grounds were wiped out after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which may be as high as 300,000 birds , is by far the most viable . // The breeding area is centered on Saona Island , 40 square miles of uninhabited mangrove swamp lying just off the southeastern tip of Hispaniola , 22 nautical miles from the town of La Romana . The birds fly north from Saona across the Catu ? n Strait and Catalinita Bay to the Dominican mainland , then inland as far as a mile to feed on the soft red elliptic fruit of the parrakeet tree , a plant indigenous to the West Indies . // As recently as 15 years ago the feeding grounds extended from a point about 10 miles west of La Romana along 60 miles of coastline to Cabo Enga ? o to the east . But much of that land has now been converted to sugarcane and grazing grasses , and what remains of this once richest of all white-crown feeding areas is less than 20 square miles between Punta Palmilla and Caleta Guan ? bano. // Raul Villaverde , an executive of Gulf+Western , the conglomerate that virtually owns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bird can not survive the guns . A season ago he conducted an informal survey of the bird 's situation on Saona . His conclusions were grim . // On one Friday , Saturday and Sunday , Villaverde covered about 10 miles of coastline between Las Palmillas and Los Orejanos . He recorded over 7,500 pigeons killed by 45 shooters . The figure might have been higher except that on Friday only seven of the shooters turned out , making that day 's bag a paltry 580 birds . // " This was a typical weekend harvest , " Villaverde said . " It was estimated that last year 's kill exceeded 100,000 birds , and it is my opinion that this estimate is on the low side . // " An average shot can expect to retrieve birds from 30% to 60% of his shells , " he explained . " Let 's imagine he averages an ' excellent ' 50% score on 100 rounds . The other 50 rounds that did not down birds probably crippled 25 that will fly off and die , making a total kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be females with two chicks in the nest . This brings the death toll to a total of around 150 birds . " Of the pigeons Villaverde inspected , 60% of the females were carrying eggs and 90% of all the birds were in full plumage , confirming that they were in the middle of a hatch . // The parallels between the factors that doomed the passenger pigeon and those that now menace the white-crowned pigeon are all too obvious . Were it also a bird of the mainland , as was the passenger pigeon , the white-crown would doubtless have succumbed long ago . The remoteness of its range and its general inaccessibility have bought it time , but now that time is running out . The jet has made even the bird 's most distant haunts no farther away than a weekend hop and , where once a privileged few partook of the slaughter , it is now open to all . // Just as the destruction of the forests which supplied its principal food and nesting places helped also to destroy the passenger pigeon , the destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white-crown . All over the West Indies , once-great stands of fruit and hardwood trees are being replaced by sugarcane and subdivisions. // Industry is doing its bit . On St. Croix in the Virgin Islands , Crause Lagoon was a major white-crown breeding area only 10 years ago . Then , in 1962 , Harvey Aluminum , Inc. moved its bulldozers in , tearing up the lagoon , destroying the mangroves and driving the white-crown out . Today not a single bird remains . // Until recently , rumors of Japanese negotiations to develop Saona Island raised fears that it might suffer the same fate as Crause Lagoon . A Puerto Rico contractor , Ventura Barnes , who has been studying the birds for two decades , was so alarmed at what he believed would result in their certain extinction that he mounted a campaign to prevent development of the island . Signing as many as 20 different names , he inundated everyone from Gulf+Western top brass to President Balaguer and his cabinet with impassioned letters imploring them to save Saona for the pigeons . As of this date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long . // On the Florida Keys , where all shooting is prohibited , the white-crown is safe from guns but its habitat is under fire . Here its principal food is the poisonwood which produces a berry delectable to pigeons and a rash despicable to people . The result is that as more and more development moves in , the poisonwood is being wiped out . // " It seems that every time I drive up a road these days , " says Alexander Sprunt , " another field has been bulldozed for a trailer park or a shopping center . The native tree cover is disappearing everywhere . With its food basically threatened , the white-crowned pigeon 's long-run existence has to be threatened . " // And so , as man records his extraordinary technological achievements in this second half of the 20th century , it seems he will also be forced to record the elimination from this earth of one more species of wildlife . // This need not be . The white-crowned pigeon could be saved , but to do so would require unprecedented effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All shooting must be prohibited during the entire nesting , breeding and hatching season . All other shooting must be suspended indefinitely until a broad-scale scientific study of the bird throughout its range determines how many , if any , can safely be shot  --  where , at what time of year , and for how long . The resultant laws must be scrupulously enforced in all countries and heavy fines levied for their violation . Existing nesting and feeding grounds must be guaranteed permanent protection . Additional new ones must be established and cultivated . Possible new food sources must be explored . More must be learned of the bird 's migratory habits  --  how far it travels , where it winters , on what it feeds . The shooting and nonshooting public must be alerted to the pigeon 's plight and united in efforts to prevent its extinction . // The white-crowned pigeon could be saved . The question is , will it ?
