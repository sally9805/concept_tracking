FADE IN : 1 INT . A FEDERAL PRISON - DAY We OPEN in a large maximum-security prison . TWO GUARDS and a gray-haired PRISON OFFICIAL walk along a seemingly endless row of cells on the second tier . Their footsteps ECHO through the cellblock , the only sound save for an occasional CLANKING bar . The guards stop in front of one of the cells and proceed to open it . The Prison Official speaks to an , as yet , unseen prisoner . &nbsp; OFFICIALYou ready , Veldini ? Out steps a scruff , somewhat tousled man in his late twen- ties , JESSE VELDINI ( known to his friends as Veldini ) . Although of medium height and weight , he seems bigger owing to the elemental toughness he exudes . He glances at the other three momentarily , nods , and then starts the long walk back down the hall . No one speaks , they 've all been through this before . CUT TO : 2 INT . A UNIVERSITY DORMITORY - DAY A tall , long-haired youth of twenty , known only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just taken from his mailbox . Clearly pleased , he crumples the letter in his fist and bounds up the stairs to his room , taking the steps three at a time . CUT TO : 3 INT . THE PRISON - DAY Veldini , escorted by the two guards and the Prison Official , walks down the silent corridor of cells , where PRISONERS are now pressed against the bars to watch him pass . His face is set and expressionless , although he nods from time to time to acknowledge their unspoken goodbyes . He 's being released on parole , but maintains his studied lack of emotion for the benefit of those who have to stay . CUT TO :  --  3  --  4 INT . A SANITARIUM SLEEPING QUARTERS - DAY The room has a bunk bed , table , and chest of drawers . Conspicuous on the wall is a bulletin board which says MILLIKAN INSTITUTE OF RECREATIONAL THERAPY on the top . A short , slightly pudgy man in his early thirties , EAGLE THRONEBERRY , is busily packing a suitcase . Dressed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nose and mouth , he seems unfettered by the fact that his every move is carefully observed by TWO ONLOOKERS . One is an OLD MAN in tennis shorts , Adidas track shoes ( spikeless ) a baseball hat with the letters M.I.R.T. on it , and a purple bowling shirt with the name ROCKY in capitals on the back . Despite his 65 years , he 's in excellent physical condition . Another is a 35-year-old woman , SAVAGE ROSE , with hair like a mountain range dressed in dusty Army fatigues . She has a touch of dignity about her . You get the feeling she entered the sanitarium after the death of Che Guevara . All three are patients in a " voluntary " sanitarium . &nbsp; ROCKYYou sure he 's gettin ' out today ? &nbsp; EAGLEYeah , I got a letter . I 'm sure it 's today . &nbsp; WOMANSay hello to him for us , all right , Eagle ? Take this along with ya . She produces a two inch silver bullet and hands it to him affectionately . &nbsp; WOMAN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The silver goes right to your soul , and it do n't hurt your teeth . &nbsp; ROCKYWe both left our tooth marks in it down by the end there , sorta like an autograph . Eagle accepts it with the same sincerity with which it is given . &nbsp; EAGLEThanks , I can really use this , I know .  --  4  --  Rocky and Savage Rose nod in agreement . It 's self-evident that he can really use this . &nbsp; EAGLE ( continuing ) Rocky , can you meet me downstairs with the suitcase ? &nbsp; ROCKY ( proud to do it ) Sure , Eagle . You want me to sign the checkout list , too ? &nbsp; EAGLEYeah , I 'd appreciate it . &nbsp; ROCKYWhen should I say you 'll be back ? &nbsp; EAGLEI do n't know . What do ya usually put ? &nbsp; SAVAGE ROSEAt the right time . &nbsp; EAGLEYeah , that 's good . Put that  --  ( striding manfully to an open window ) Take care of yourselves , I 'll be back at the right time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns it . He bites down on the bullet and climbs out the window as we CUT TO : 5 A SHOT FROM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW Eagle begins a two-story descent down the side of the building on a rope made of tied-together bed sheets and doctor 's aprons . CUT TO : 6 INT . THE PRISON - DAY Veldini , in civilian clothes now , is going through a final processing .  --  5  --  He hands his prison clothes through the window of a barred " cage " area . In return he is given his wallet and other personal valuables . The Prison Official is still with him . Veldini checks his wallet and finds it empty . He sticks his hand back through the window , palm up . The MAN IN THE CAGE , with thinly-veiled contempt , counts out six dollars and twenty cents . CUT TO : 7 EXT . THE DORMITORY - DAY The Kid sneaks out a back door of the dormitory with his luggage . It consists of an electric guitar slung over his shoulder , and a three-foot-high amplifier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is complete with a re- chargeable battery . Once clear of the dorm , he makes a less than graceful sprint to the street , and hops on the back of a slowly passing tow truck , like an electric Jack Kerouac . CUT TO : 8 EXT . A DESERTED GAS STATION - DAY We see Eagle in a telephone booth , changing from his leo- tard into formal equestrian gear . He emerges from the booth completely turned out for the Hunt . CUT TO : A TITLES SEQUENCE All of the following is done to an upbeat BLUES NUMBER in the spirit of Elmore James ' " I Believe ( I 'll Go Back Home ) " or Canned Heat 's " On the Road Again " . TITLES are seen OVER . Section Details 9 EXT . CROWDED , FOUR-LANE ROAD We PICK UP Veldini walking along , grip bag in hand . Smoth- ered by gas stations , bars , body shops , tire stores , and hamburger stands , he presses on with a loose , rocking stride . It 's John the Conqueroo bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of place .  --  6  --  10-11 SERIES OF SHOTS The sequence develops with Veldini alternately walking and trying tohitch a ride . He wears wrinkled corduroy pants , motorcycle boots , and a Levi jacket mended with patches of tweed and even some silk . Despite his often flamboyant style ( crouching on fire hydrants , pounding on car doors , standing in the middle of the street ) , he is ignored by virtually every type of vehicle , including a kid on a tri- cycle . Eventually , he 's joined in his futility by Eagle and then later by the Kid . It 's apparent from their casual interaction that the three know each other well . 12 EXT . LARGE FREIGHT YARD The first time we see them all together , they 're walking in the middle of a railroad track in a large freight yard . They all move with the same insistent , rhythmic gait , like a tidal wave that never breaks . In the distance , a massive freight train bears down on them . Oblivious to it , they continue their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eagle wears the formal riding clothes , including cape and top hat which he put on in the telephone booth . He trails a suitcase on wheels behind him . The Kid , still carrying his guitar and amp , wears randomly bleached blue Levis , cowboy boots , and a black sleeveless T-shirt . This we will see is his standard uniform . The train is right on top of them now , filling the FRAME . Just as it appears they 're about to meet their doom , MUSIC AND TITLES END . 13 EXT . ELEVATED ROAD As the TITLES END , we PICK UP Veldini , Eagle and the Kid walking wearily along the shoulder of an elevated road . They stop , drop their bags , and gaze fondly on some as yet unseen territory down below the road , like Columbus looking on the New World . &nbsp; VELDINIWell , there it is . What do ya think , Kid ? The Kid stares ahead in confuso-amazement . He obviously does n't know what to think . 14 WHAT THEY SEE We PAN over acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye can see - cars piled up in some places as high as 50 feet .  --  7  --  &nbsp; VELDINI ( V. O. ) Still lookin ' good , Eagle . Lotsa Lincolns. ( to the Kid ) Best house a man can have , Kid . 15 EXT . AN OLD APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY Veldini is seen climbing up the fire escape of an old brick apartment building . He stops at a window on the fifth floor and peers in . Section Details 16 INT . IRIS ' APARTMENT Inside the room , a slightly paunchy , but respectable looking MIDDLE-AGED MAN is making love to an attractive young woman in her middle twenties , IRIS CAINE . Iris could even be described as beautiful if you catch her right , but she pre- fers to look more tangible . An uneasy mixture of resolute elegance and innocent vulgarity , she is one of the last of the self-made whores , a woman who does at least a little of it for Art . Somewhat bored right now , however , she glances over to the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceeds to enter the room . She points frantically to the man on top of her , motioning Veldini to go away . He pays no attention . The Man , catching sight of him , leaps up from the bed in embarrassment , covering himself with a sheet . &nbsp; MANGet the hell out of here . What are you , some kind of crazy man ? &nbsp; VELDINITake it easy , I just . . . Before he can finish , the Man picks up a bottle and advances on him . Veldini draws a gun , genuinely put out that the guy made him go to all the trouble . He orders the Man over against the wall , and rigs the gun up on a coat rack so that it stays in place , flush against the Man 's back , even though he 's no longer holding it . He then returns to Iris . &nbsp; IRISGod dammit , Veldini , that 's the Fire Chief . He 's the best customer I have .  --  8  --  &nbsp; VELDINITwo years I been gone and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have waited five minutes . Even thirty seconds would have done it , and the gun , you ca n't just . . . oh , hell , are they after you ? Glancing over at the Fire Chief , who is still standing facing the wall , with his hands up : &nbsp; VELDININot yet , they just let me out . &nbsp; IRISFor good ? &nbsp; VELDINIYeah , maybe . &nbsp; IRISWhat do ya mean maybe ? &nbsp; VELDINIThey let me out for good last time , too . Sometimes they lie . Suddenly the Fire Chief , in an impressive display of finesse , whirls around , knocks the gun off the coat rack , dives forit on the floor , and comes up in the kneeling firing position . &nbsp; FIRE CHIEFAll right , buddy , keep ' em real high . Iris , call the police . ( he glances down at his naked body ) Wait a minute , Irish , do n't call the police . Keep ' em right up there , buddy , no sudden movements . While the Fire Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowers his hands and whispers to Iris : &nbsp; VELDINIYou seen Duval lately ? &nbsp; IRISYeah , he 's got a place on the . . .  --  9  --  &nbsp; FIRE CHIEF ( enraged ) Keep ' em up there , you son of a bitch , or you 'll look like that vase . The Chief squeezes off a SHOT at a large porcelain vase on the coffee table . Instead of a loud report , we see a soft stream of water issue from the gun and trickle down the side of the vase . Veldini quickly pulls a rubber knife out of his boot and throws it at the Chief , hitting him squarely in the chest . The Chief , fearing the worst , passes out on the floor . &nbsp; VELDINIBoy , you really get some savages in here , Iris . Veldini comes back over to the bed , unbuttoning his shirt on the way . Iris , however , pulls the sheet further over her . &nbsp; VELDINI ( continuing ) What are you covered up like that for ? &nbsp; IRISWho do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dumb stunt and then come back two years later and expect me to leap in the nearest bed . &nbsp; VELDINIWell , you did n't have far to go . Iris turns away in frustration . &nbsp; VELDINIWhat do ya want me to do , fill out a goddamn application ? When it 's been this long , it 's hard to be subtle , sweetheart . &nbsp; IRISI do n't want to start with you again , Veldini . I got everything I need . &nbsp; VELDINII see , you like these weenies !  --  10  --  &nbsp; IRISBetter than bein ' poor . &nbsp; VELDINIAll right . . . ( leaning close to her ) . . . what if I just take you ? &nbsp; IRIS ( leaning close to him ) You 'll owe me one hundred dollars . &nbsp; VELDINI ( leaning back again ) You 're crazy , Iris . Nobody pays that kinda money . &nbsp; IRISYou wan na see the list ? &nbsp; VELDINI ( still doubting , but becoming exasperated ) Christ , it was twenty when I left . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRIS ( seeing the Chief stir ) No. . . you 'd better go , Veldini , he 's wakin ' up . &nbsp; VELDINITake me out to Duval 's tomorrow ? &nbsp; IRIS ( trying to hurry him ) All right , meet me here at noon . Just get going . I do n't want a scene . &nbsp; VELDINI ( taking her chin and lifting her head ) I 'm back , Iris , and I 'm gon na be around .  --  11  --  Veldini turns and goes back out the window . Iris stares after him . FADE OUT . FADE IN : Section Details 17 EXT . AN AUTO JUNKYARD - DAY It is early morning as the CAMERA PANS over the yard , coming to rest on a tiny figure at the top of a gigantic mound of demolished cars . It 's Eagle . Dressed like a stream fish- erman , he 's casting off the top of the mound with a flyrod . Every so often he reels in a small piece of steel and puts it in his creole . Fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kid . The three have spent the night in the junkyard . The Kid is gathering up his musical equipment obviously getting ready to go somewhere with it . Veldini is shaving in the cracked rear-view mirror of a wrecked car . We can see that the three have set up house in three separate cars . Eagle 's car has clothes and a few pots and pans hanging from the exposed superstructure of the roof , the dashboard has become a combination mantel-bookcase , various toilet supplies are shelved on the folded-down glove compartment door , and the car in general is hung with various pictures and posters . Veldini complains with every pull of the razor . &nbsp; KIDJesus , why do n't you give up ? Veldini holds his razor up like the Statue of Liberty , his face full of shave cream : &nbsp; VELDINII 'm goin ' to see Frank , that two- fisted Crime Fightin ' Man . You wan na come ? &nbsp; KIDWhat for , I never have anything to say to him . &nbsp; VELDINIWell , he 's your brother , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta recharge this battery . If he really wants to see me , he 'll let me know .  --  12  --  &nbsp; VELDINIYou 're gon na miss breakfast , ya know . Eagle 's catching some fish . CUT TO : 18 EAGLE out on his mound of junk . He baits his hook with a couple of horseshoe magnets and then casts the rod . We HEAR the MAGNETS CLINK into the metal below . The Kid and Veldini continue to be heard VOICE OVER . &nbsp; KID ( V. O. ) I do n't like fish . &nbsp; VELDINI ( V. O. ) Go tell him then . . . but do it nice . &nbsp; KID ( V. O. ) How can I tell him to stop catchin ' fish when he 's not catchin ' any ? We LEAVE EAGLE and COME BACK to Veldini and the Kid again . &nbsp; VELDINIYou ca n't . But he 'd only insist he was , if you told him he was n't . Got that ? We look to the Kid . He does n't quite seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd rather have him not catchin ' fish than hunting leopards . If he tries to shoot another goddamn Afghan , they 'll send him to a real institution , not one of these recreation jobs . &nbsp; KIDThey could do that anyway . &nbsp; VELDININaw , Kid , we 're all gon na stay clean this time . You ca n't lose ' em all . The Kid nods more in hope than belief . CUT TO :  --  13  --  19 EAGLE working his way back through the junk . Upon reaching the other two , he dumps the contents of his creel out for all to see  --  mostly hood insignias , gear shift knobs and a pair of baby shoes . Holding up a plastic laminated gear shift knob in the form of a woman 's breasts : &nbsp; EAGLECaught it in a ' 56 Ford . ( looking over to a rusted ' 56 Ford ) Looked like the guy ran it into a ' 62 Studebaker from the shape of the dents . &nbsp; VELDINIYou ca n't tell that by looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell that by looking at the dents , me , I can tell that . &nbsp; VELDINI ( to Eagle ) See any Derby cars ? &nbsp; KID ( suddenly irritated ) You 're not startin ' that Demolition Derby stuff again ? &nbsp; EAGLEWell , he can hardly quit now when there 's only two cars left to go . &nbsp; KID ( shaking his head vehemently ) Oh no , man , it 's just gon na eat up all your money , and then you 'll have to stick some guy up again . &nbsp; VELDINI ( holding up two fingers ) Two cars . Two lousy cars and I 'll have smashed every American car ever built between 1940 and ' 60 at least once , and most of ' em twice . Not many guys can say that .  --  14  --  &nbsp; KIDNot many guys have been in jail three times either . &nbsp; VELDINIOnly two of those had anything to do with cars . That last thing was a fluke . The Kid realizes it 's useless to argue . He loads himself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; VELDINI ( continuing ) How about it , Eagle , you see anything ? &nbsp; EAGLE ( casually ) A ' 54 Buick and a ' 58 Rambler , that 's about all . Oh yeah , a ' 50 Merc . Veldini practically self-destructs . This is quite possibly the greatest thing he 's ever heard . &nbsp; VELDINIA ' 50 Mercury ! For Christ sakes , that 's one of the Big Two . Why did n't you run back here and tell me ? &nbsp; KID ( dryly , still holding all his equipment ) He did n't want to scare the fish . The Kid takes his leave with his equipment . &nbsp; VELDINIGod damn , the ' 50 Merc . One down and one to go . Wooo-wee . &nbsp; EAGLE ( referring to the Kid ) Where 's he goin ' ? &nbsp; VELDINIOut to recharge his battery if he can find some power he likes .  --  15  --  &nbsp; EAGLEWhere , at the Roller Rink again ? CUT TO : Section Details 20 INT . A LARGE , CROWDED DEPARTMENT STORE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His guitar sticks up like a periscope above the throng . Eagle and Veldini 's conversation continues VOICE OVER . &nbsp; VELDINI ( V. O. ) I think he 's really sneaking up on the Federal Building . He ai n't gon na be satisfied until he 's pulled some juice outa there . He got some County stuff once , but it was n't even 110 volts . Everything he played was flat . We FOLLOW the Kid up the escalator and into the furniture section , where he unplugs a floor lamp , plugs in his amplifier and settles down in a big leather rocking chair . He plucks a few strings on his guitar , listening carefully to the sound quality . He 's not pleased with what he hears . 21 THE KID &nbsp; EAGLE ( V. O. ) Hell , if he wants quality he oughts go to the electric companies and get it right off the turbines . Once it 's out on the lines , you never know what you 're gon na get . - in a typical bathroom display . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror ( and above the sink ) . The Kid sits on the toilet seat , bent over his guitar , analyzing the sound . CUT TO : 22 THE TV SECTION &nbsp; VELDINI ( V. O. ) That turbine stuff is for classical musicians . He needs something with a little grit in it , you know what I mean ? It takes time , that 's all . You ca n't just plug into the first socket you see and expect to get it . . . Eagle , what would look nice mashed into a ' 50 Merc ? The Kid has finally found some acceptable current . As he waits for his battery to recharge from a floor socket , he sits on top of his amplifier staring at a bank of 20 or 30 televisions , all on different channels . CUT TO :  --  16  --  Section Details 23 EXT . THE JUNKYARD &nbsp; EAGLE ( looking over the baby shoes ) Hard to say . It 's blue now , you gon na leave it like that ? &nbsp; VELDININaw , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mauve . &nbsp; EAGLE ( thinking it over carefully ) Candy mauve , huh ? Might look real good if you hit him with a taxi yellow ' 52 Nash . Sort of a peach melba feeling . &nbsp; VELDINI ( swinging a fist in the air ) God damn , Duval will love it . Show me to this car , Eagle . &nbsp; EAGLEWell , you got ta keep in mind it 's only the trunk and the left rear door . &nbsp; VELDINIYou mean all I need is the whole rest of the car ? Eagle nods and keeps on walking . Veldini stops , disgusted and kicks an already well-dented fender . Section Details 24 INT . FRANK VELDINI 'S OFFICE - DAY Veldini is shown into the office by a 45-year-old SECRETARY with a well ratted , rust-red hairdo and a disposition to match . Escorting Veldini into the office has been a big drag for her . Except for the abundance of legal books , the room is like any other executive office - carpeted , wood paneled , furnished and decorated in the Motel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and comes over to shake Veldini 's hand . Younger than Veldini by 3 years , he is no less imposing . There 's a certain tension in their meeting , as between any two men who should like each other but don't.  --  17  --  &nbsp; FRANK ( sizing Veldini up ) Good to see you again , Jesse . Have a seat . Veldini winces slightly at the sound of his first name . Since birth it 's been a constant source of embarrassment to him . &nbsp; VELDININo thanks , I 've been sittin ' down ever since I last saw you . Veldini starts to walk around the room . Frank , irritated by it , goes to sit behind his desk . &nbsp; FRANKI wanted to get down to visit more , but it 's poison for a D.A . to spend too much time around prisons . You understand , do n't ya ? &nbsp; VELDINI ( checking the room out ) Looks like you been doin ' all right in spite of me . Last time I was here you did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you might even be running for Attorney General . &nbsp; FRANK ( suddenly becoming more attentive ) Is the Kid with you ? &nbsp; VELDINIYeah , for awhile . &nbsp; FRANKFor how long ? &nbsp; VELDINI ( looking at a picture of Frank 's wife and kids ) Just until he decides to leave .  --  18  --  &nbsp; FRANK ( impatient ) We 'll see . Have a seat , will ya , Jesse . I need to talk some things over with ya . Veldini plops down into a well-cushioned chair across from Frank . &nbsp; FRANK ( continuing ) You layin ' off the cars ? &nbsp; VELDINIFor awhile anyway . I thought I 'd try to get my old job with the wrecking crew back first . If I do some straight work for awhile , I can get enough to open my own track . And then you 're gon na see something , Frank , you can count on that . Not just your average , small-time fender dentin ' , hell no , we 're gon na have some real demolition . Veldini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a mixture of fascination and contempt . &nbsp; VELDINI ( continuing ) We 're gon na have mud to get stuck in , houses to knock down , telephone poles to wrap around and lakes to sink in . And we ai n't gon na tie ourselves down to just cars . No sir , we 'll start bringin ' in campers , tractors , dump trucks , school buses , grain threshers - anything you want . And then when we get goin ' good , then comes the best of all  --  mobile homes ! Ca n't you just see those two mothers smashing into each other . Woo-wee . Veldini punctuates the " woo-wee " by slamming his fist into a flimsy , tin cabinet door , making a large dent in it and knocking the files on top to the floor . He is genuinely surprised at the damage he 's done .  --  19  --  &nbsp; FRANKGoddammit , sit down , Jesse . I 'm sorry , the wrecking job is out . You 're not allowed any access to explosives . &nbsp; VELDINIThat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am your parole officer , and I already got you a job . Veldini is stopped cold , like a man who realizes they 've finally come to the point , and he has nothing to say about it . &nbsp; FRANK ( continuing ) You 'll still have your other guy , Beck , for official purposes , but everything clears through me . You 'll check in here and I 'll make out the reports . I did n't want to do it this way , but neither of us can afford to have you screw up again . If you stay clean , you 'll get some favors out of it . &nbsp; VELDINI ( angered ) I can get my own job . &nbsp; FRANKNot with your record , unless you lie . And if you do , I 'll find out and you wo n't have the job long . &nbsp; VELDINIThat 's friendly of ya , Frank . &nbsp; FRANKDo n't talk about friendship . Were you thinkin ' of me when you broke into the bank to steal their god-damn burglar alarm ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from gettin ' sent up for it , did ya .  --  20  --  &nbsp; FRANKI had no choice , Jesse . You broke the law . . . and if you do it again , you 'll go back in the rack forever . Try and keep that in mind . &nbsp; VELDINI ( backing off ) Will do , Frank . ( he starts for the door ) &nbsp; FRANKOne more thing . Do n't do anything you would n't want me to know about . . . I can always have you tailed . A KNOCK is heard at the office door . Veldini flattens himself against the wall as if in a 1950 's prison break film . The door opens and the Secretary enters with a sheet of paper . As she goes forward to Frank 's desk , Veldini deftly slips behind her and out the door , having first checked both ways for possible tail men . He then makes his way for the main exit door , hiding behind desks , cabinets , hat racks and door jambs on the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 21-38 25 EXT . A DEAD END ROAD - DAY Veldini , Eagle , the Kid and Iris are driving rapidly along a two-lane road in Iris ' M.G. Just as the road is about to dead end , Iris swings the car sharply into a fenced-in dirt lot full of old airplane fuselages ( such " airplane graveyards " are not uncommon in California and Arizona ) . All the planes are in a state of advanced disassembly ( i.e. , lacking wing sections and engines ) except one , a World War II amphibious plane , the NAVY PBY-6A . On its nose we see the name " BIG TOLEDO " painted . A short , bearded man , DUVAL JACKS , is working on the only engine left on the plane . He 's dressed in mechanic 's overalls and wears a cap that says " Air India " . Iris drives the car right up under the wing of the PBY . Duval jumps down to greet them , and embraces his old friend Veldini . CUT TO :  --  21  --  26 INT . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the PBY , drink- ing beer , except Eagle who wanders in amazement through the cockpit . &nbsp; VELDINIYou got some salt around ? Duval pushes a container of salt over to him . Veldini pours some in his beer . &nbsp; VELDINI ( continuing ; suspiciously ) Why you payin ' rent ? &nbsp; DUVALIt was either that or get thrown out . This here 's private property . I got two payments a month . &nbsp; IRISYou make any yet ? &nbsp; DUVALNo , they 're comin ' to throw me out on Saturday . You 're welcome to drop by if you want . &nbsp; VELDINICa n't you get any money up ? &nbsp; DUVALI do n't work steady , ya know . And crashin ' cars ai n't cheap . You do n't make nothin ' unless you win . Besides , I got expenses  --  food , beer . . . &nbsp; IRIS . . . airplane parts . . . &nbsp; VELDINI ( standing up and pointing a finger at Duval ) I thought so , you been out blowing all your dough on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . That 's just plain dumb , Duval.  --  22  --  &nbsp; DUVAL ( rising to the occasion ) Dumb ? Do you realize what you can do with one of these babies ? We could go to Paris , London , Rome , Pittsburgh , all those places . There would n't be one goddamned demolition derby , ship launching or building under construction we could n't get to . You could see all the oil refineries , power plants and dams you ever dreamed of . This thing even lands on water . There ai n't no car in that league , pal . I 'm doin ' you a favor working on this plane . Duval 's speech has fallen on his listeners with the power of Salvation . Eagle begins sashaying around the table serving beer like a stewardess . Veldini walks around thinking things over . He takes out a cigarette and holds it , unlit , between his teeth as he paces . &nbsp; VELDINII do n't know , Duval , this airplane business can only turn out bad . He stops pacing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUVALThe left engine is almost ready to go and then all we need is a right engine and a few instruments . And maybe not even that ; people have flown these things with only one engine , they 're such great planes . &nbsp; VELDINIEvery time I start wanting something , I get in trouble , and this is bigger than anything I 've ever wanted  --  if I start wanting it . How about electirity and all that . Can the Kid plug in and play all right ? &nbsp; DUVALYeah , we 'll have a special outlet for him .  --  23  --  &nbsp; VELDINII still do n't know . This thing 's gon na take a helluva lot of money , Duval . We 've never had that much before . &nbsp; DUVALWe ai n't had no airplane before either . The people who own it are willing to sell for $5,000 . If we all get steady work , we could make it in three months . &nbsp; KID ( joining in ) It 'd take you longer than that to buy your own track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet , waiting for Veldini 's reply . Veldini , however , continues to think it over , the unlit cigarette still held solidly between his upper and lower teeth . &nbsp; DUVAL ( encouragingly ) If we get tired of it , we could always smash it into a locomotive or something . Still no reply from Veldini . &nbsp; DUVAL ( continuing ) We could even go somewhere , where there ai n't no jails . Veldini hesitates a second longer , then finally looks up . &nbsp; VELDINIYou know that Eagle will have to be the Captain , do n't you ? &nbsp; DUVALSure , why not ? &nbsp; VELDINIWell , he do n't know how to fly for one thing . &nbsp; EAGLEI can still radio the tower and all that .  --  24  --  &nbsp; KIDI can do most of the wiring . &nbsp; VELDINIIris could do all the decoration . . .

You see the iron gate there on the left ? The iron gate is visible in the FULL SHOT . &nbsp; ZOO OFFICIAL ( V.O. ) ( continuing ) Behind that there 's a little room with food in it .

Veldini glances angrily at Frank , and then steps into the cage through a side door . In one hand , he has a shovel device , in the other a waste-can .

CUT TO : Section Details 27F INT . AN OLD BAR - DAY Eagle and Iris are playing at the coin-operated pool table  --  Iris in jeans . Eagle in the uniform of a commercial airline pilot . While they play , a rather homely , bikini-clad dancer , SAMMI , does a listless go-go routine on a platform near the bar . The owner , JUKE , a large woman in her early fifties , is serving beer to the three or four other players in the place . Iris is an excellent pool player . At present , everything she shoots is going down . She punctuates her conversation by sinking one ball after another , hitting them about as hard as you can without knocking them off the table . &nbsp; IRIS ( worked up ) Interior decorator .

You want some beer ?  --  27  --  &nbsp; IRISNo thanks , Juke , give it to Sammi . &nbsp; JUKEI do n't think she 's awake yet . How about you , flyboy ? &nbsp; EAGLE ( offended , pointing to his bars ) It 's Captain . &nbsp; JUKEDo n't pull no rank in here , Harry .

If you could beat her , she would n't play ya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot awhile , Eagle . I 'm tired . Eagle walks to the table to discover that all that 's left for him to shoot is the cue ball . He looks over to Iris , but she 's too preoccupied to be aware of it . He reaches down into the rack to get some more balls . &nbsp; EAGLEMaybe he 'll stay out this time . &nbsp; IRIS ( softening ) Not if he needs money to buy the plane .  --  28  --  &nbsp; EAGLE ( putting the balls up on the table ) It 's not just his , we 're all gon na help pay for it . What are ya worried about ? Eagle is now gliding around the table with the same finesse and concentration that characterized Iris ' play . He moves rapidly from shot to shot , his cue moving like a well-oiled piston . He does n't seem to notice that nothing he shoots goes in . &nbsp; IRISHow you gon na do that ? You do n't even have a job . &nbsp; EAGLEWell , it ai n't easy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had jobs before . &nbsp; EAGLEYeah , in the circus .

A CHEAP , BARREN APARTMENT ROOM - DAY Painted institution green , the room is basically just a rectangle with a concrete floor , one window , a sink and toilet . Frank is showing Veldini around , checking the paint and the fixtures like a real estate agent . Veldini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reaction ) Well , what do ya think ? &nbsp; VELDINIGreat , it even has a window . Frank lets it ride . Veldini takes a handball out of his pocket , and starts to juggle it . &nbsp; FRANKThere 's a shower and a kitchen down the hall . You can get a vacuum from the desk . &nbsp; VELDINIWhy do you keep this up , Frank ? You know I 'm not gon na stay here . &nbsp; FRANKIt 's not that bad , if you give it a chance . &nbsp; VELDINII can always get evicted . &nbsp; FRANKThat 'd be stupid . I 'll just get you the place back again . . . I own the building . Veldini , having no rejoinder , begins to hit the handball leisurely against the wall .  --  31  --  &nbsp; FRANK ( continuing ) If you 're worried about your job , you 'll get a better one as soon as you show me you can handle it . But you 're startin ' from the bottom like all the other cons .

You hear what I say , Jesse ? Veldini is rallying freely now , playing the ball off three walls . &nbsp; FRANK ( continuing ) Quit hitting the goddamned thing , you 're marking up the walls . Veldini ignores him , prompting Frank to jump forward to catch the ball before Veldini can hit it again . Just as he is about to reach for it , Veldini gives it a tremendous blast . The ball comes off the wall like a bullet and whizzes past Frank 's ear , narrowly missing him . Frank maintains his composure and walks down to the other end of the room where the ball is lying in a corner . He picks it up and comes back toward Veldini , slowly backing him up against the wall . Frank stops halfway across the room and takes off his coat . He stares at Veldini a second , and then throws the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dives to the floor , as the ball whizzes by , hits the wall , and bounces back to Frank . Veldini scrambles to his feet . Frank winds up and throws again . Evldini dives the other way this time , barely escaping a hit , as the ball again returns to Frank . Now Frank backs up against the far wall and takes a run- ning start . At the halfway point , he begins to make his throw . Veldini crashes to the floor again , but this time Frank holds onto the ball . He walks slowly up to Veldini and stands over him . &nbsp; VELDINI ( scornful but calm ) If I'da had two shots , I would n't have missed .  --  32  --  &nbsp; FRANKBut you do n't have two shots , do you ? Frank puts the ball in his pocket and walks out the door . Veldini , still on the floor , heaves a sigh of relief and frustration . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details 29 INT .

The dinner table is lavishly set for two , with utensils , glasses and plates of the art noveau period . There are three kinds of wine , and several chafing and fondue dishes , indicating a variety of cuisine . Iris herself is in the bedroom dressing . Wearing a long , low cut gown , also of the art noveau style , she is in the final stages of putting up her hair . It lays in great swirls above her head , held in place by arabesque combs . She smoothes out the ends with dabs of wine . Her preparation for the evening will continue throughout the rest of the scene . It is all done with the care and attention to detail that characterizes the true professional .

Iris perfumes her neck and cleavage . &nbsp; VELDINIAnother parade of rinky-dinks tonight , huh ? Iris puts bracelets on both wrists , they extend down over the backs of her hands . &nbsp; IRISJust one , when it 's for dinner . Veldini holds one particular , custard-like dish out for her to see , as if to ask her what it is . &nbsp; IRIS ( continuing ) Moussaka . He requested it . &nbsp; VELDINI ( annoyed that she would cater to the guy ) So you give it to him just like that . Iris hitches up her dress , and putting broaches on the garters holding up her embroidered stockings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VELDINII 'm lucky to get a piece of fuckin ' celery . &nbsp; IRISI do n't mess with him .

Suddenly a KNOCK is heard at the door . The customer has arrived . Iris stiffens . &nbsp; VELDINI ( fighting for her attention ) This one 's not just for me . It 's gon na take all of us . Another KNOCK is heard , this one louder . Iris rushes to get ready . Veldini , angered and frustrated by the interruption , whirls toward the door . &nbsp; VELDINI ( shouting ) Wait a minute , you son of a bitch . I 'm still gettin ' ready .

FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT He sees the customer , a well-dressed man in his late thirties , moving hurriedly toward his car . Veldini tries to think of something to yell to stop him . Coming up with nothing , he climbs over the fire escape railing , and hanging by one hand from the platform , yells for help ! The customer hears him , looks up at him hanging five stories from oblivion , and then gets in his car and drives away . &nbsp; VELDINI ( shouting , still swinging in the breeze ) Fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire escape and goes to Iris ' window .

Nothin ' could get her out , not even old Abraham , who is some kind of stud . . . I do n't know if you 've ever seen what happens to the ladies when that boy steps into a cage . Seven hundred pounds of joy , and all of it real Rhinoceros . Anyway , old Sadie is stayin ' in there day and night , and all the people was gettin ' mad because they could n't see no Rhino .

She 's accosted by a MAN , who , at first , is not clearly visible in the crowd .

Eagle is out in the lot dressed like a World War I Infantryman , with helmet and knickers .  --  42  --  Starting about fifty yards away , he 's making a torturous advance on the position of the two checkers players ; now crawling on his stomach ; now sprinting a short dis- tance and leaping into a trench .

You smell somethin ' ? &nbsp; VELDINI ( making a move ) It 's just the manure I been collectin ' . Duval looks at him in disbelief . &nbsp; VELDINI ( continuing ; pointing , still preoccupied with the game ) In the bags over there . Duval looks to a line of plastic bags piled up near the plane . Suddenly , he 's hit in the head by a wayward arrow from Eagle . &nbsp; DUVALChrist , Eagle , why do n't you learn how to shoot the goddamned thing ?  --  43  --  &nbsp; DUVAL ( back to Veldini ) What kinda manure ? &nbsp; VELDINIMostly lion and polar bear .

Eagle , who has popped his head out of a trench to listen to Duval , is hit by one of the Kid 's arrows . He refuses to fall dead , however . The Kid is fit to be tied . &nbsp; KIDHey , goddammit , I hit you . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours , Kraut . He lets fly an arrow which lands nowhere near the Kid . &nbsp; KID ( shouting ) You 're a chicken , you know that . You been running around in the same place for an hour and now you do n't fall dead when I hit you . Okay , man , if that 's the way you want it . From now on , this is war . The Kid leaps out of his bunker and makes a break for a nearby pile of junk . No sooner has he taken a step , than he 's hit by one of Eagle 's haphazard arrows . Eagle leaps out of his trench in triumphant jubilation . The Kid , however , pretends he was n't hit . Eagle implores Duval and Veldini to be his witnesses , but to no avail . The Kid starts shooting again . Eagle quickly dives behind an airplane wheel to avoid the hail of arrows . As he dives out of FRAME , we see four POLICE SQUAD CARS pull into the lot in the distance .

Veldini looks across the road . There is n't anything in sight . &nbsp; VELDINI ( cheerfully ) Well , it looks like you got him outnumbered anyway , Officer . Can I see your warrant ?

You 're only required to go to three inches above the knee . &nbsp; VELDINIHow can you be sure he ai n't hanging up there in the garters somewhere ? Iris lifts her floor-length skirt to three inches above the knee and shakes her legs in order to jar loose any criminals . The Rookie is satisfied . The Captain enters the compartment and reacts with a slight start upon seeing Iris . &nbsp; CAPTAINHello , Miss Caine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two have met . &nbsp; IRIS ( curtly ) I have friends here . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( looking at Veldini ) Business friends or hangers-on ? &nbsp; VELDINIFriends.  --  46  --  &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( looking at Iris , but indicating Veldini ) I hope this is n't one of them , I 'd hate to get any of mine mixed up with his . Veldini leaps out of his chair in an effort to get at the Captain , but is caught and held back by two Cops . His anger now becomes more self-directed . He 's given the Captain a chance to demonstrate his superiority in the power equation . &nbsp; CAPTAIN ( continuing ) I 'm not the only one , boy . There 's a lotta guys ahead of you .

Veldini stops her at arm 's length , having come to a sudden realization . &nbsp; VELDINI ( hard as nails ) You told him where I was , did n't you ?  --  48  --  &nbsp; IRIS ( just as hard ) I only told him . . . Before she can finish , Veldini smashes her across the face , knocking her to the floor and bloodying her lip . &nbsp; IRIS ( continuing ; quietly ) I only told him you were staying here .

THE AIRPLANE LOT - LATER THAT AFTERNOON Veldini sits in a pile of junk drinking beer , looking like a lone rooter in a deserted grandstand . He stacks the cans in a pyramid next to him . Duval and the Kid are playing a MARCHING MUSIC DUET down in front of him , Duval on tuba , the Kid on washtub bass . Eagle , dressed in carpenter 's overalls , is twenty yards or so away constructing some sort of building facade in the middle of the lot . So far he 's built a short flight of steps leading up to a door . Next to the door , he 's in the process of erecting another large frame , apparently to hold a full-length window . &nbsp; VELDINI ( squeezing the beer can he 's just finished ) How long has it been since you were in a good fight , Duval ? &nbsp; DUVAL ( lowering the tuba to wipe his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49  --  &nbsp; VELDINII thought maybe you 'd know somebody who wanted to get in one .

Veldini leans back in solemn contemplation of this fact . Duval starts to run through a finger exercise on the tuba , quickly snapping Veldini out of his contemplative state . &nbsp; VELDINIYou look like you 're gettin ' your touch back . &nbsp; DUVALIt 's comin ' . I can feel ' em gettin ' quicker . ( his fingers play rapidly over the tuba keys ) In a few days I 'll be as fast as ever . By the way , here 's your wallet . He holds out Veldini 's wallet . Veldini quickly checks his back pocket and is surprised to find that it 's empty . &nbsp; VELDINIYou really gon na start again ? &nbsp; DUVALHell , yes , Frank ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts the pressure , we 're gon na need some fast money . Duval gives a little signal to the Kid . The Kid smugly produces a pack of cigarettes and holds them up for Veldini to see . Veldini checks his shirt pocket and finds it empty . Embarrassed , he snatches the cigarettes from the Kid .  --  50  --  &nbsp; DUVAL ( continuing ; proudly ) I 've been teaching him how to reef . He does an intricate pickpocketing motion with his fingers . &nbsp; DUVAL ( continuing ) Guitar players pick it up real fast . He could be a helluva cannon . Eagle now comes by carrying his carpenter 's tools . He stops when he gets to Veldini and casually hands him his ( Veldini 's ) cigarette lighter . Veldini is amazed . He checks to see if his jockey shorts are still there , snapping the elastic reassuringly . &nbsp; VELDINI ( to the Kid ) You sure you wan na do this , Kid ? It 'll get ugly if they catch you . The Kid nods soberly , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing ) You do n't have to stick your neck out either , Duval .

Duval returns to his tuba playing . CUT TO : Section Details 56 INT . IRIS ' APARTMENT - NIGHT At first the room appears to be empty .  --  51  --  We hear a few tentative NOTES FROM A PIANO and the CAMERA MOVES to reveal Iris sitting at a piano in a corner of the room . The left side of her lip is bruised from the force of Veldini 's blow . She is playing a contemporary blues  --  something like Tracy Nelson 's " DOWN SO LOW " . After a few seconds of straight playing , she begins to sing , mellow at first , becoming progressively more intense . There is nothing sentimental about her perfor- mance  --  once she 's into it , she sings like Jack the Ripper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we were not previously aware . As she finishes the song , a KNOCK is heard at the door . She goes to answer it , resentful of the interruption . She opens the door just a crack to find Frank . &nbsp; FRANKHello , Iris . . . can I come in a minute ? &nbsp; IRIS ( very short ) Not now , I 'm closed . &nbsp; FRANKI came to talk , not to buy . &nbsp; IRIS ( starting to close the door ) There 's nothing to talk about . &nbsp; FRANK ( stopping the door with his hand ) There is if you want to stay in business . Iris hesitates a second , then turns and walks away from the door , leaving Frank to open it the rest of the way himself . He goes to the bar and pours a drink . &nbsp; FRANK ( continuing ) You 're a little ragged tonight . You want a drink to settle down ? &nbsp; IRISI paid for my protection , I do n't owe you anything .  --  52  --  &nbsp; FRANKRelax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRISGet on with it , Frank . . .

Make sure everything 's legal ? &nbsp; FRANK ( increasing the pressure ) If you do n't tell me , they might do something that 'll get Jesse sent up for good .  --  53  --  &nbsp; IRISYou used that one last time , Frank . . .

She realizes it and starts to turn her head away again , but it 's too late . He takes her chin and brings her head back around . &nbsp; FRANK ( surveying the bruise with his finger ) He do that to ya ? Iris says nothing ; she pulls her head away . Frank knows he 's guessed right . &nbsp; FRANK ( continuing ; with contempt , pressing his advantage ) Quite a man you got there . &nbsp; IRIS ( definitely down ) He 's not my man . &nbsp; FRANKThen he 's paying for it like everybody else ? &nbsp; IRIS ( coming back now ) Not everybody else can buy . . .

You 're a fool , Iris . Two small time liquor stores and a fake bank job and you think you finally got a hero . &nbsp; IRISNo , Frank , that 's what you think . I do n't need any proof . Frank has no comeback and it shows . He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a wad of bills . &nbsp; FRANKWhat 's his price , Iris , the old twenty ? Iris does n't answer . Frank tauntingly holds a ten-dollar bill up in front of her face . She ignores it . Frank pulls out another ten and puts it next to the first one , the bills almost touching her cheek . She still ignores it . Frank tears off the top half-inch of the second ten as if to make it a nine . &nbsp; FRANK ( continuing ; brushing the bills across her lip ) You 're gon na take this , and be glad I did n't make it less . Iris slaps the money out of his hand . It falls to the floor . &nbsp; IRISVeldini never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He holds out his arms , implying that she can start by undoing his shirt . &nbsp; FRANK ( continuing ) Let 's see whose side you 're on .  --  55  --  Iris seemingly has no choice . She begins a very pro- fessional job of disrobing him , peeling the clothes in a sort of abstracted massage . When he is naked to the waist , she delicately unbuttons his belt , opens his fly and carefully pours his ice-cold drink into his pants . Frank 's initial discomfort gives way to rage , but he resists the urge to hit her . There are other ways . Frank grabs up his clothes , and walks out the door with- out a word . Iris watches him go ; she knows what comes next , and breaks down . DISSOLVE TO : Section Details A PICKPOCKETING MONTAGE Duval , Eagle and the Kid ( during the MONTAGE referred to as THE THREE ) are followed through a series of pick- pocketing adventures .

While the man is busy helping the Kid retrieve his change , Duval reaches under the partition from the other side of the stall and takes his wallet from his lowered pants . At the same time , Eagle , standing on the toilet , reaches over the top of the partition and empties the pockets of the man 's suit coat , which is hanging on a hook .

In order to free his hands to make payment , the man tucks the folder under his arm . Duval , however , with precise timing , intercepts it from behind at the end of the tucking motion , and substitutes a folded newspaper of about the same thickness . The man clamps his arm down on the newspaper thinking it to be the folder . Duval makes off with the real folder , passing it immediately to Eagle crossing perpendicular to him .

He then takes Iris ' arm and they walk off down the street , Iris glancing back every once in a while to see if anyone is following them .

The Zealot is pleased . The Kid continues to play , mean- while , as his audience grows . Section Details 62 EXT . THE ZOO - DAY Veldini stands at the side of the lion cage , pushing the button to open the feeding room gate . As it opens , all the lions go out but one , who remains lying in a corner . &nbsp; VELDINIC'mon , Cadillac , get the hell outa here , or you ai n't gon na get no dinner .

Keeping a close watch on the lion , he walks gingerly over to a pile and quickly scoops it up . Cadillac follows him with his eyes , but otherwise remains perfectly still . Veldini inches a little closer , stretching to scoop up another pile . Cadillac raises his head this time , causing Veldini to back off several steps .  --  60  --  The word , meanwhile , has spread rapidly , and a crowd is beginning to gather around the cage . Sensing themselves to be witnesses to a truly underground event , with all its connotations of fragility , danger and illegality , the members of the crowd watch in rapt silence . Veldini is both exhilarated and scared stiff . He eases to within three feet of the lion 's massive paw . Cadillac gets to his feet and emits a muffled growl . Veldini backs off again but not as much as before . He seems to know something now . Cadillac , as if momentarily bored , plops down again , but keeps his eyes firmly trained on Veldini . Brimming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elan of a bullfighter , wielding his tools with a new-found flair . He electrifies the crowd with a dramatic scoop no less than two feet from Cadillac 's nose , and then caps the performance by turning his back on the King of Beasts and walking slowly away , masterfully trailing his shovel behind him like a matador 's cape . The unusual size of the crowd brings two ZOO OFFICIALS running to the cage ; one armed with an automatic rifle . They shout frantically at Veldini to get out . Veldini tips his cap to Cadillac and turns to leave . Cadillac , however , scared by the commotion , gets to his feet and takes a step toward Veldini . A SHOT RINGS OUT and Cadillac falls dead . The two Zoo Officials run up to the cage , led by the same gray-haired man who trained Veldini the first day . &nbsp; ZOO OFFICIALYou stupid son of a bitch . What the hell are you tryin ' to do ? Veldini ignores him , looking only at the body of the lion . He slowly picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mightily against the bars of the cage , covering the two Zoo Officials with dung .

THE AIRPLANE LOT - DAY Eagle , in his carpenter 's suit again , and Duval are out in the middle of the lot , by the free-standing door , installing a large sheet of glass .  --  61  --  Veldini comes into the lot still wearing his zoo keeper 's overalls . He 's down and looks it . &nbsp; VELDINIWhat 's that ? &nbsp; EAGLEA piece of glass . The kind drunks leave saloons through .

Veldini wants to ask " what for " but he 's too tired and knows it would be a stupid question anyway . He starts toward the PBY , but is stopped by the SOUND of an approaching car . A late-model sedan pulls into the lot , and stops about twenty feet from the door . Three COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS get out . Two are middle-aged and wear business suits . The third is younger and rather burly . You get the feeling that he 's actually a plainclothesman . Duval ducks behind the door , while Eagle finishes install- ing the glass . The three men walk up to the " Entrance " and stop , expecting Eagle to come out from behind the window and acknowledge their presence . Instead , he merely points to the door .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's expected of them , but finally one of the middle-aged men , HARTWELL , walks up the stairs and reluctantly rings the doorbell .

I 'm afraid we have some bad news for you . A spot check of your residence conducted during police operations showed it to be in violation of several public health ordinances , particularly those pertaining to plumbing . &nbsp; DUVAL ( taking off his hat and scratch- ing his head ) Yeah , well , we have n't had time to put much of that in yet , but we 're gon na get on that real soon . &nbsp; HARTWELLBe that as it may , I 'm afraid we ca n't allow Sinclair Aviation to continue renting this property to you under these conditions . &nbsp; DUVALWhy do n't you talk to them then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bathrooms . &nbsp; HARTWELLWe did , this morning , and they decided that it would be easier and less costly for everyone if the planes were just sold into scrap and the area cleaned up .

They all know it 's a set-up , but there 's nothing they can do about it .  --  63  --  &nbsp; HARTWELL ( continuing ; faking a note of cheer ) We did manage , however , to talk them into a ten-day grace period , so as to give you enough time to relocate . We know this is a little sudden , but in enforcing the ordinances , we protect you , too .

The Kid has seen what 's happened . &nbsp; KID ( pissed off ) What the hell did you do that for ? &nbsp; EAGLEYou wan na go stop him ? Let me hear what you 're gon na say . The Kid thinks a second , then slumps back silently in his seat . &nbsp; EAGLEDo n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 81 THE CARS are now forming a circle around the perimeter of the infield for the start of the derby . The drivers rev their engines in anticipation . Just as the starting horn SOUNDS , a big , cream-colored ambulance roars onto the track , accelerates across the infield and smashes the ' 50 Merc up into a two- ton accordion . The MERC DRIVER is mad as hell that he 's out of the competition before he even got to shift out of first . The ambulance , meanwhile , backs at full speed into the center of the infield where it is simultaneously crushed beyond re- pair by four other cars . Veldini emerges triumphantly from the rubble . 82 BACK UP IN THE STANDS Eagle checks his watch . &nbsp; EAGLENot bad , four and a half seconds . CUT TO : Section Details 83 INT . A CROWDED JAIL CELL - DAY Veldini is in a dimly-lit " tank " cell with eight other PRISONERS . Most of them talk animatedly among themselves , while Veldini just sits silently against the wall . A gray- ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to him , stares a second , and then violently grabs his throat . &nbsp; TRAINOne more word outa you and I 'll squash your Adam 's apple like a fucking grape . Train lets go and leans back waiting for Veldini 's reaction . Veldini sits tight , but not because he wants to . Train spits in his face . Veldini starts forward , but is suddenly con- fronted by four other BLACK MEN , seemingly out of nowhere . The rest of the group goes about their business as if nothing were happening . Veldini settles back against the wall , the spit still on his cheek . He starts to wipe it off , but one of the blacks grabs his hand in mid-air , and pulls it slowly back down to his side . &nbsp; TRAIN ( continuing ) Well , how about that . I did n't even think you was breathin ' there for awhile . What are you in for , blabbermouth ? &nbsp; VELDINII do n't know .

If you want to kill a man , sometimes it 's the same as killin ' him . I 've killed a lotta guys in my mind . That 's why I 'm still dangerous . You got ta keep that in you , or you fall asleep , and when the morning comes , somebody 's broken into your pants and stolen your heat . You 're tough , kid , but you ai n't very dangerous yet . Veldini makes no objection , he 's still catching up . One of the blacks hands Train a joint . He takes a hit and passes it to Veldini . &nbsp; VELDINI ( taking a toke , and passing it back ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big one .

He do n't know how to act . Train lets the smoke filter slowly out his nose . Veldini slumps back against the wall . Suddenly all conversation stops , Train swallows the joint . Three GUARDS approach the cell , ONE with KEYS , the other two with shotguns . They stop and open an empty cell directly across from the tank . There is something menacing about their presence .  --  75  --  &nbsp; KEY GUARD ( coming over to the tank ) Everybody over against the far wall except Veldini .

Veldini hesitates a second , then brings his hand up and wipes the cheek that does n't have any spit on it . The Guards , in- furiated , grab him roughly , handcuff his hands behind his back and whisk him out of the cell . CUT TO : 84 INT .

Frank comes down the corridor and is let in to Veldini 's cell , the two guards remaining outside .  --  76  --  The group in the tank suddenly becomes more attentive . &nbsp; VELDINI ( breezily ) Frank , how 's everything down at the County Health Department ? &nbsp; FRANK ( sharply ) Come on , get up . The charges were dropped just like you knew they 'd be . &nbsp; VELDINI ( surprised ) What ? &nbsp; FRANKYour halloween friend bought off the ambulance company , so I sweat a little and you get to spend a few hours in jail to show me you 're still a bad ass . &nbsp; VELDINIOh , hell , I do n't do any time just to ruin your life , Frank . &nbsp; FRANKI told you to get up . &nbsp; VELDINI ( rising reluc- tantly ) You 're really goin ' all out this time , are n't ya ? &nbsp; FRANKI 'm tired of you pushin ' the rules at my expense , Jesse .

I do n't care about the votes . &nbsp; VELDINII 'll try and keep that in mind . &nbsp; FRANK ( grabbing Vel- dini and slam- ming him against the wall ) Horseshit , you got no choice , not any . &nbsp; VELDINI ( glancing at the two guards ) Only because you got them . Frank steps back and then explodes a punch into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doubling him over . It is not a sneaky punch , we had the feeling he was going to do it . Just as it appears Veldini will slump to the ground , he bursts out of his crouch and crashes Frank to the floor with a punch to the jaw . Both of the blows have been monumental , but Veldini 's is particularly impressive . The two guards rush into the cell and quickly subdue Veldini , pinning his arms behind his back . Frank pulls himself off the floor and walks over to his shackled brother , who glares at him with a defiance that repeats the line " Only because you got them " . &nbsp; FRANKDo n't ever try to embarrass me again , Jesse . While the guards hold Veldini securely in place , Frank be- gins to work him over . CUT TO :  --  78  --  85 TRAIN in the tank cell watching the beating with the other pris- oners .

THE POLICE STATION/CITY JAIL WAITING ROOM - DAY The Kid is standing next to his amp , playing a quiet " prison " blues . Eagle sits next to him on a bench , peri- odically checking his watch . There are several other people in the room waiting for friends and relatives . Most of them seem to be experienced at this sort of thing . Several policemen in the area of the waiting room have become aware of the Kid 's playing . One of the SENIOR OFFICERS walks over and abruptly yanks the amplifier plug out of the wall . The amp , however continues to work on the auxiliary power provided by the battery . The Kid , who is facing away from the Officer , keeps on playing , ob- livious to the fact that his amp has been unplugged . The Officer amazed by the amplifier 's persistence , looks for new plugs to pull . Finding none in the wall , he rips the power cord out of the guitar . The Kid turns around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the Officer , resumes his concert . The sound is greatly diminished now , but the strings can still be faintly HEARD .

A CITY BUS - NIGHT It 's late at night and Veldini is the lone passenger . His face is bruised and cut in several places from the beating he 's taken .  --  79  --  He sits passively in the back of the bus , watching the city lights move past the window , the only SOUND being the con- sistent hum of the bus engine . At the first stop , a YOUNG WOMAN , wearing a cape and wide- brimmed hat , gets on and sits in the front seat . Unable to tell from his vantage point that the mystery lady is really Iris , Veldini decides to get the young woman 's attention . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly along the floor toward the front of the bus . Iris hears it coming , as if it were an approaching siren , but pretends not to notice . The marble CLINKS harmlessly against the back of the driver 's chair . Iris glances at it out of the corner of her eye , but makes no gesture of recognition that might be visible from the back . Undaunted , Veldini takes out his handball and rolls it down the aisle . Because of the relative stillness in the bus , it sounds more like a bowling ball . Iris ignores it just the same . Frustrated by her continued unresponse , Veldini pulls off his boot and hurtles it violently down the aisle . It crashes into the driver 's seat , causing the driver to stop the bus and look around . Veldini storms out the back door and hobbles off down the street , like a man walking up a flight of stairs sideways . CUT TO : 88 INT .

The place was probably an underground cultural center in the early fifties , but has since fallen on hard times . Veldini sits at a table with a beer and a dish of spaghetti .

She flashes a quick smile and then disappears into the women 's room . Veldini jams on his boot , races up the stairs , and  --  89 INT . LADIE 'S ROOM  --  barges into the women 's room , furiously ripping open all the toilet stalls in search of Iris . Finding nothing but shrieking ladies , he notices that the back window is open .

CUT TO : 91A SKID ROW Iris runs on the sidewalk now , passing under the marquees of innumerable nudie theatres . The street is less deserted here , owing to a large congregation of STREET WALKERS .

Seeing no sign of Iris , he busts down the first door he comes to .  --  81  --  93 INT .

Visibly tired now , she stops suddenly , and brandishes her gun at Veldini , who pulls up about ten yards away . &nbsp; IRISStay right there , Veldini . I 'm resting now . It 's no fair catching me while I 'm resting . &nbsp; VELDINI ( champing at the bit ) When I catch you , Iris , I 'm gon na break every bone in your goddamn body and burn your intestines .

CUT TO : 98 VELDINI chasing Iris along the flatcars . He 's closing fast now , eating up the distance with giant strides . They come to a car that 's divided in half by a wood partition . On the side nearest the two are a few scattered boxes ; on the other side some building materials , mainly bricks and concrete blocks . Iris stops , climbs around the divider and starts to run again . Veldini , ignoring the laws of molecular structure , approaches the partition and runs right through it , splin- tering it to shreds . He then crashes , in rapid succession , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pile of concrete blocks . He emerges mangled and rubber- legged but manages to summon enough energy to fall forward and grab Iris , dragging her down and ripping half her clothes off in the process .

We PULL BACK to reveal that the ladder is built into the side of a towering refining tank , and that he 's climbing toward a catwalk some 50 feet above the ground . Iris is already on the catwalk , curled up asleep in her cape .

A NAVAL AIR FIELD - NIGHT We begin TIGHT on a pair of concentric chain-link fences , separated from each other by a yard-wide gravel path . The eight-foot inner fence has wires attached to it at various points , indicating that it 's electrified . The outer fence is of heavier construction , and stands a few feet higher , owing to the addition of a dense strip of barbed wire around the top . In the distance , and at this point OUT OF FOCUS , we see a dark figure running toward the fences at full speed . He appears to be carrying some sort of long stick or pole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence , he jams the pole into the ground and vaults skillfully over the two barriers , clearing the barbed wire by inches , and landing like a cat just inside the electric fence . It 's the Cook . Camouflaged in a black leotard and hood , similar to the out- fit worn by Eagle in his " escape " from the asylum , the Cook makes his way to a power box , and proceeds to cut the feed wires , thus de-electrifying the inner fence . He then gives a signal with a small penlight , and suddenly several other leotarded figures ( from here on referred to as the Group ) spring out of the shrubbery and creep stealthily toward the fences . Recognizable among them are Veldini , Eagle , Duval , Iris and the Kid . The Work Foreman cuts an opening in both fences with wire-cutters , and the rest of the Group scrambles through , making a break for a squadron of old planes lined up along the side of the air strip . Surveying the field from the cover of the planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights , separates the Group from its objective , a giant hangar some fifty yards away . &nbsp; VELDINIThat 's it , Eagle . What do ya think ? &nbsp; EAGLEIt 's some hangar all right . Take me maybe ten minutes to get in , depending on how long it takes me . &nbsp; VELDINI ( to Duval ) Where are all the guards ? &nbsp; DUVAL ( squinting to see ) There 's nothing classified on this field , so they 'll probably only have one or two inside . You disappointed ?  --  88  --  &nbsp; VELDINIHell , this ai n't hardly anything . You ready , Eagle ? Eagle nods and moves out to the edge of the shadows cast by the planes . Satisfied that it 's all clear , he makes a frenzied dash across the almost fluorescent runway to the side of the hangar , where he takes temporary refuge behind a wooden crate . He notices that about 40 feet up in the otherwise solid slab of concrete that forms the hangar door , is a machinery opening big enough for a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully , as if they might somehow be out of adjustment , he starts to climb straight up the sheer face of the door , with no visible hand-holds or tools of support . The Group is amazed . &nbsp; DUVALGoddammit , Veldini , how does he do that ? &nbsp; VELDINII do n't know . How does he do that , Rocky ? &nbsp; ROCKYYou ever been in the circus ? &nbsp; VELDININo . &nbsp; ROCKYThen I ca n't tell ya . Veldini , always humble in the presence of the Esoteric , ac- cepts his answer with equanimity . Eagle is now about 30 feet up and climbing steadily . He reaches the machinery opening and crawls through it . CUT TO : 107 INSIDE THE HANGAR Eagle finds himself up in the rafters , from which hang var- ious cables , ropes , lift equipment , and suspension devices . As he scans the cluttered floor below , he discovers a guard shouldering a rifle . At the far end of the hangar , Eagle spots the PBY that Duval had said would be there . The confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow beam and inches his way along it to a position directly above that of the guard . Careful not to make noise , he starts to pull up a guide rope that hangs down from the beam to a point about two feet above the unsuspecting guard 's head .  --  89  --  108 BACK OUTSIDE The rest of the Group , is sprinting , one by one , across the runway to a small door at the side of the hangar . A few are carrying black bags containing special tools . The flow of bodies across the field is momentarily stopped , however , by the landing of a Navy Cargo Plane . Veldini , who is crossing at the time , is forced to dive behind a strip light to avoid detection . 109 EAGLE having now reeled up the entire rope , grabs the free end and crawls back along the beam to the wall with it . He ties the rope tightly around his waist , and takes a firm grip on the slack with his hands . Crouching down , he stares at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then leaps resolutely off the rafter . CUT TO : 110 LOW ANGLE SHOT - FROM IN FRONT OF THE GUARD In the far b.g. , we see Eagle swooping down from the ceiling in a long arc , like an urban Tarzan . At first just a speck in the distance , he looms up larger and larger as he rapidly gains speed and comes hurtling TOWARD the CAMERA , knocking the guard flat on the way with an outstretched heel . Eagle 's momentum carries him on to the far wall , where he alights in a steel scaffold about 25 feet above the floor . He then drops off the rope , collects the gun , and goes to the side door to let in the rest of the Group , who have all crossed the runway by now . Duval , with Veldini and the Kid close behind , runs over to the PBY  --  111 INT . PBY  --  and climbs into the cockpit to get a look at the naviga- tion console . &nbsp; VELDINIOkay ? &nbsp; DUVALNot bad , except they got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do n't beat all hell .

The Group sees him , but it 's too late for anyone to catch him on foot . Eagle quickly tosses the rifle he took from the guard to Veldini . Veldini shouts at the guard to stop or he 'll shoot . The guard glances back a second , but keeps on running . Veldini levels the rifle and repeats his warning . The guard ignores it again . Veldini 's finger curls over the trigger . Every- one is yelling at the guard now , pleading with him to stop , but he 's too close to the switch to consider surrender . Just as he reaches for it , Veldini pulls the trigger . Nothing happens . The guard yanks the switch down . Again nothing happens . He jerks it up and down frantically , but the alarm refuses to sound . The guard turns to face the Group , wondering what the hell went wrong . Eagle smiles sympathetically , and holds up a small fuse for him to see . The guard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens it only to find himself confronted by the Boxer , who knocks him flat with a right cross . Eagle turns back to Veldini and tosses him the loaded clip from the rifle , with a look that says it 's the thought that counts . Veldini would be more surprised that Eagle had removed it , if he were n't so damn glad .  --  92  --  &nbsp; DUVALLet 's go , the truck 's gon na be here in three minutes . The Group quickly wheels the trash bin out the side door and leaves it next to a similar bin on the runway side of the hangar . 124 EXT . HANGAR They then prepare to recross the landing strip and make their escape through the fences . Eagle is the first to go again . Just as he slips through the outer fence , and the Kid is about to start across , the SOUND of an engine is heard . A Navy Patrol Jeep , carrying three MILITARY POLICEMEN , comes into view along the fences , obviously making a perimeter search . The Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VELDINIShit , even they could n't miss that hole . We 'll have to go out with the console . &nbsp; KIDWhat about Eagle ? &nbsp; VELDININothin ' we can do now , Kid . We 'll have to hope he makes it . Suddenly another engine is HEARD , this one much louder than the jeep . A white garbage truck pulls up to the hangar and backs in toward the bins , blocking the line of sight between the Group and the patrol jeep . The Group uses the cover to climb quickly into the second trash bin ( the one without the console ) . A garbageman gets out of the passenger side of the truck cab and walks back to get the bins ready for dumping . The patrol has now found the hole in the fence , and the three M.P.s are inspecting the area . One of them hops in the jeep and roars over to the garbage truck . He arrives just as the console bin is being dumped . The M.P . and the , as yet unidentifiable truck driver ( RAY ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray , you seen anybody strange on the field tonight ?  --  93  --  &nbsp; RAYNot that I know of , but I saw a couple of sailors running toward the fence out there last night . The console bin is lowered , and the second bin is hoisted up . &nbsp; M.P.Did you get a good look at ' em ? &nbsp; RAYNaw , it was too dark . Besides , I was in the service once . &nbsp; M.P . ( not at all amused ) Well , I guess they got away then . We 'll get ' em coming back in . The second bin is dumped . &nbsp; RAY ( giving a limp salute ) You bet , Phil . The second bin is being lowered , as the M.P . whips the jeep around and speeds back to the fence . The garbageman returns to the cab , and the truck pulls out . 125 BASE AND MAIN GATE We FOLLOW it on its way through the base to the main exit gate . Ray stops , waves at the Sentry , and passes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good look at the men in the cab : Ray we recognize as the Muscular Man from the batting cage ; the garbageman is the Owner of the Tattoo Parlor . CUT TO : 126 BACK OF THE GARBAGE TRUCK ( MOVING ) The area normally reserved for garbage is completely lined with foam rubber . The console rests in the middle , with the members of the Group arrayed around it . There is very little talk ; a general air of despondency prevails . &nbsp; DUVAL ( to no one in particular ) Eagle 'll get away .  --  94  --  &nbsp; VELDINISure . He always does . . . sooner or later . The others are not convinced . Neither is Veldini . DISSOLVE TO : pp. 57-78 &nbsp; pp. 95-102 127 INT . THE PBY - MORNING The console has been installed and Veldini , Duval , Iris and the Kid are the only ones left in the plane  --  their ac- complices have disappeared back into the sidestream . Veldini gazes out a turret window , looking for some sign of Eagle , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the switches . &nbsp; DUVAL ( from up in the pilot 's chair ) We better get goin ' , Veldini . When your brother finds out a hangar 's been robbed , this is the first place he 's gon na look . &nbsp; VELDINI ( knowing it 's true , but not any hap- pier for it ) Okay , start it up , Duval . Veldini comes over and sits in the co-pilot 's seat , as Iris takes his place at the window . Duval prepares to start the engines . &nbsp; DUVAL ( mumbling to himself ) Fuel pump . . . check , circuit breakers , engines primed , ignition . . . Okay , here we go . Duval turns on the first engine . It kicks over and starts with no trouble . &nbsp; DUVAL ( continuing ) Number one engine in . He turns on the second engine . It sputters for a few seconds and dies . All eyes go to Duval . He shrugs and tries it again . No soap .  --  95  --  &nbsp; DUVAL ( continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans had won the war , we would n't have this problem . He tries it once more , this time with determination . The engine sputters , turns over , and finally kicks in . &nbsp; DUVAL ( continuing ; si- lencing the skeptics ) Number two engine in . &nbsp; VELDINI ( reading from a clipboard ) All right , where were we ? Fuel pressure . . . &nbsp; DUVAL ( reading from gauge ) 15 p.s.i . &nbsp; VELDINIOil pressure . . . &nbsp; DUVAL95 p.s.i . Veldini looks back at Iris , asking a question with his eyes . Iris answers with a glance that indicates there 's still no sign of Eagle . &nbsp; VELDINI ( turning back to his clipboard ) Altitude . . . &nbsp; KIDAltitude ? &nbsp; VELDINIJust read it , will ya ? We got ta know it works . &nbsp; KID ( humiliated ) 34 inches .  --  96  --  &nbsp; VELDINICylinder head temperature . . . &nbsp; DUVAL400 F. &nbsp; VELDINIThat 's about it . &nbsp; DUVAL ( a little sad ) You sure there is n't something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can never be too safe . Duval makes no reply , leaving it up to Veldini . &nbsp; VELDINI ( continuing ; resigned ) Naw , go ahead , take it out . 128 EXT . LOT AND ROAD Duval slowly taxis the PBY out of the lot and onto the ad- jacent road , which will serve as the runway . As he swings the plane around to point it down the pavement , he 's met by an awesome sight : A FLEET OF SQUAD CARS , probably twenty in all , is heading up the road toward him , a relentlessly advancing mass of flashing red lights . Veldini , Iris and the Kid are also watching from the cockpit now . The fleet halts its advance about 200 yards from the plane . High- powered rifles and machine guns begin to appear in and around the cars . Two motorcycles , one equipped with a side- car , emerge from the formation and continue on toward the PBY , finally stopping at a point midway between the squad cars and the plane . Frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duval cuts back the engines slightly in order to hear , as Frank raises his megaphone . &nbsp; FRANKJesse ? You hear me , Jesse ? He lowers the megaphone and waits for an answer , but none is heard . The squad cars begin to fan out into a semi-circle .  --  97  --  &nbsp; FRANK ( continuing ; rais- ing the megaphone again ) We know about the hangar , Jesse . Cut the engines and come out . I 'll see you get a deal . 129 INT . PBY &nbsp; VELDINI ( turning away from the window ) Yeah , Frank , peachy . &nbsp; DUVALWhat about the engines ? &nbsp; VELDINIKeep ' em on , till I figure somethin ' out . &nbsp; FRANK ( getting impa- tient and shouting louder ) We got 50,000 rounds down here , Jesse . You 'll never make it off the road . Come on out and I 'll call down the guns . Veldini glances back to Iris and the Kid . &nbsp; VELDINIIt could get a little rough goin ' outa here . I do n't blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself if I did n't have to . Iris and the Kid just fasten their seat belts . What a stupid question . &nbsp; VELDINI ( continuing ) You sure they got cars where we 're goin ' , Duval ? &nbsp; DUVALYeah , that 's what Eagle said . Veldini stares out the window at the squad cars , his fingers tapping lightly on the instrument panel .  --  98  --  &nbsp; DUVAL ( continuing ) Where are we goin ' , Veldini ? &nbsp; VELDINISomeplace where there ai n't no jails , just like you said . &nbsp; DUVALThere ai n't no such place , ya know . &nbsp; VELDINIYeah. . . yeah , I know . Duval nods his head slowly . He sorta figured that all along . 130 EXT . ROAD &nbsp; FRANK ( angry now , but with a hint of anticipation ) You got 30 seconds , Jesse . Do n't make me blow you outa there . Frank raises his hand to alert the squad cars . The Kid gets ready at the navigation console . Duval 's hand moves to the throttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two forces , a silence emphasized by the drone of the plane engines . 131 ANGLE Suddenly a SHOT RINGS OUT from a hill on the side of the road opposite the airplane lot . Frank halts his count . All eyes and the CAMERA MOVE to the crest of the hill to reveal a LONE RIDER silhouetted like an apparition against the sky , a rifle held above his head . Everyone on the road remains quiet as the rider ceremoniously holsters his rifle and slowly descends the hill on his sturdy , but obviously battle- scarred black mustang . Behind him he leads FOUR OTHER RIDER- LESS HORSES , all of which have rifles sheathed to their saddles . Wearing tattered Mexican peasant clothes , and three wide gunbelts which criss-cross on his chest , the rider looks like the ultimate border desperado  --  ill-kempt beard , snarled hair and a flat , wide-brimmed hat concealing cat-like eyes . He is Pancho Villa , Yojimbo , and Joaquin Murietta rolled into one . He is the personification of Justice , and the baddest man we have ever seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  99  --  132 INT . PLANE &nbsp; VELDINI ( somewhat awed ) Son of a bitch , I knew he 'd be back , but will you look at that . 133 EXT . PLANE &nbsp; FRANK ( to one of his officers ) Farrell , get the binoculars on that guy . 134 INT . PLANE &nbsp; DUVAL ( even more awed than Veldini ) That 's the best one he 's ever done , Veldini . Better than Grat Dalton or Jesse James . &nbsp; VELDINI ( soberly ) Better even than Billy the Kid . 135 EXT . ROAD Eagle is approaching the road now . Like a man nearing the end of his march to the sea , there is something deadly earnest in his bearing . We feel that he has assumed his last disguise , the crowning expression and summation of his consciousness , the grand finale of his act . He has evolved to this , and here he will stay . Frank has been watching Eagle 's approach in a slightly dis- concerted , but vigilant silence . He knows he ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to do . His indecision is reflected in his men , whose guns are now lowered . Frank brings them back to the alert . 136 INT . PLANE &nbsp; VELDINIGet the green box out of the back , Kid . Wire it for two minutes . &nbsp; DUVALWe gon na ride ? &nbsp; VELDINIFor a long time , Duval , for a long time .  --  100  --  137 EXT . PLANE Eagle is now on the road , the hooves of his mustang click- ing on the concrete . He stops in front of the plane and makes a half turn to face the squad cars . His face is set , revealing neither contempt nor fear . The plane engines are once again the only discernible SOUND , humming like two giant fans installed to cool the path of the horseman . Frank squints to get a better view , poised to issue an order at the slightest sign of action . Veldini , Duval , Iris and the Kid now disembark from the plane and walk slowly to the four riderless horses . As they begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . The cars start to move for- ward cautiously . &nbsp; VELDINI ( climbing into the saddle ) You 're lookin ' good , Eagle . &nbsp; EAGLE ( evenly , still looking straight ahead ) I mean this one , Veldini . &nbsp; VELDINIWe all mean this one , Eagle , it 's just a little scary , that 's all . It helps not havin ' much choice . Eagle 's face softens into a slight smile . &nbsp; KID ( uneasy , a little scared of horses ) How long we gon na be on these things , Eagle ? I never rode one . &nbsp; EAGLEJust until we can get to a helicopter . &nbsp; IRISWhat helicopter ? &nbsp; EAGLEThe one I got parked just beyond that ridge . ( he points to the ridge )  --  101  --  The group is amazed at the extent of Eagle 's preparation . &nbsp; KID ( checking his watch ) 25 seconds . &nbsp; VELDINIOkay , everybody walk slow and they might not shoot us right off . ( turning to the plane ) So long , Toledo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn their horses around , and move off down the road , away from the police cars . As they pass under the plane wing , we  --  CUT TO : 138 REVERSE ANGLE FROM IN FRONT OF THEM - EXTREMELY LONG LENS In the f.g. , we see the five , walking their horses slowly , seemingly oblivious to the army of squad cars steadily bear- ing down on them from the b.g. 139 THE FIVE They unsheath their rifles and hold them at the ready , like an outlaw band riding into a hostile town . For them , there is nothing behind them now ; in the future all the fire will come from the front . 140 THE PLANE is now midway between the five and the rapidly approaching squad cars . Just as the cars are nearing the plane , it EXPLODES into a billowing ball of fire , massive , thunderous and final , raining debris on the road and effectively closing it to the passage of any cars . The police frantically at- tempt to skirt the roadblock , but are thwarted on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other by a wide ditch . They can do nothing but FIRE futilely through the wall of flames .  --  102  --  141 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL The Outlaw Band is now in full gallop , riding like the wind , more in advance than in flight , the four horsemen and one horsewoman of the Apocalpyse . They are headed for the Bad- lands , but we know they 'll be back , and that they 'll arrive just like they left . FADE OUT . THE END pp. 79-94 &nbsp;
