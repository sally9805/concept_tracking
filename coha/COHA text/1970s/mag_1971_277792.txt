Q. : What type of enterprise do Chrysler Corp. , CNA Financial , Fibreboard , Walt Disney Productions , International Paper , LTV Aerospace and Signal Oil all have in common ? <P> A. : Development of recreational real estate . <P> There is a lemming-like quality to today 's corporate captivation with large-scale ventures in leisure-time communities . Scores of prominent , publicly held companies have leaped into the risky business , investing more than $700 million in the hope of big , though perhaps slow , profits . Few have become so extensively involved as Boise Cascade Corp. , which has 29 recreation projects spread from Hawaii to New Hampshire . The company 's chiefs , much to their surprise and dismay , have belatedly discovered that environmental zealots are increasingly able to stall or block even the well-planned development of unspoiled woods and shorelines . <P> About 1 years ago , for example , Boise Cascade bought 17,000 forested acres along a finger of Puget Sound near Bremerton , Wash. , and laid elaborate plans to convert about a third of the property into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company failed to specify that it would install a sewer system , conservationists and local residents began to complain about possible pollution . Kitsap County commissioners imposed so many conditions that the development is still stalled . " We tried to relate to the local people , " says David Carey , the project manager , " but we did n't know how . They were frightened out of their wits . " Because of another communication gap , Boise Cascade 's state-approved plan to create a hotel and resort complex on the island of Hawaii started a furor among people opposed to just about all speculative subdivisions . The company has sunk $30 million into the development but has not yet sold the first lot . <P> All together , Boise Cascade lost $ 11 million last year in recreation markets . At the same time , the recession and tight money weakened two of the company 's mainstay activities , housing and lumber . As a result , total profits fell 55% to $13.4 million , while sales dropped 1% to $1.7 billion . During the fourth quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That performance was doubly disappointing because until last year Boise Cascade had seemed to be doing just about everything right . In the 14 years since energetic Robert V. Hansberger , now 50 , took over as president , the company has spread from lumber into other building materials , paper , packaging , office supplies , factory-built houses , on-site houses , apartments and mobile homes . Almost all of Hansberger 's 35 mergers have been with firms related in one way or another to timber or its uses . Even last year 's acquisition of San Diego-based CRM Inc. , a publisher of magazines ( Psychology Today ) and textbooks , fits the pattern . A Harvard Business School graduate , Hansberger was so successful in filling his headquarters in Boise , Idaho , with imaginative young men from elite business schools that other companies made Boise Cascade a hunting ground for executive recruits . Hansberger , however , had a stable of ready replacements .
