THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ANEw ENGLAND correspondent has sent us these notes , jotted down after a winter-afternoon visit to Narragansett Pier , Rhode Island : It was a bright , sunny day . Snowy fields glittering outside my window . Lots of birds in the bird feeder . The sky perfectly blue , and the air as cold and clear as water in a mountain brook . A lovely interval between the storms we 've been having this January . My phone rang . A friend said she 'd heard that a man fishing down at The Pier had seen a penguin sitting on a rock . I doubted it was a penguin , but I was curious . I got in the car and drove the four or five miles from my farm to The Pier . On the stone fishing jetty , I parked beside a van . A tall young man  --  mustache , watch cap , denim jacket , bluejeans , binoculars  --  was looking out at something in the water . He said that it was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a murre , Standing on a rock with its wings stuck to its sides , it had looked like a penguin . Now it was back in the water . He could n't figure out any way to catch it . He had no boat , and even if he did have one the bird could dive and get away . The young man said that his name was Jim Herrmann , and that he was a biologist . We watched the bird bobbing on the water . There was almost no surf . Sometimes waves roll in here and crash against the seawall , but on this summer day of winter there were only shiny wavelets lapping the rocks . Herrmann said that the bird would n't last long . Another storm was due , and anyway the bird would starve in a few days . The little waves were washing it closer to us . It looked serene and graceful . No distress . It was eerie to see it float without complaint  --  or any sign that it was doomed . Herrmann felt bad about leaving it there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could do . He turned to go . I could n't leave quite yet . Suddenly , a series of larger waves came along . They washed the bird toward the rocky shore . I called to Herrmann , and he came back . The bird was at the edge of the rocks . A bigger wave came . I do n't know if the bird scrambled ashore or was tossed , but it disappeared among the boulders . Herrmann 's hopes revived . He said that maybe the bird was wedged in a crevice . If so , he might be able to get it . He climbed down among the boulders and along the shore . I followed . Then the bird reappeared  --  it had got up on a rock about fifty feet ahead of Herrmann and just a few feet from the water 's edge . It stood up straight on the rock with its wings hanging down , looking very much like a penguin . It seemed to be trying to soak up warmth , hut , even in the bright sun , the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as not to startle the bird back into the water . Then he crept along  --  slowly , cautiously  --  stalking it , I followed . It was exciting . Like a kid 's game . When the bird turned our way , we stopped dead and waited . The bird hopped and struggled up to a higher rock . That was good . Now there was room for Herrmann to get between it and the water . He took off his jacket and balled it up under one arm . The bird was looking nervous now . Turning its head this way and that . Herrmann moved fast He reached his goal  --  the narrow space between the bird and the slippery , weed-covered rocks where the sea lapped . Then he threw his jacket over the bird and dived after it , like a football player covering a ball . He shouted in triumph , and got to his feet , holding the bird bagged inside his jacket . When I got to him , he was grinning . " Gee whizz ! " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The bird was a quiet lump inside his jacket We picked our way back to smooth ground . Herrmann stopped and opened the jacket a little . I saw the bird 's dark-gray head and pale breast , its slender bill , Its bright bird eye closed and opened , closed and opened . Herrmann said he would take the bird to the Norman Bird Sanctuary , in Middletown , to be cleaned . I congratulated him , and went back to the car . Since it was such a lovely day , I decided to take my dog for a walk on the beach at the other end of Ocean Road . I drove under the arch between the Towers , designed by Stanford White , which are all that remains of Narragansett 's heyday as a watering place . In the nineties , it had a casino and a bathing pavilion . My grandmother used to come here in a horse-drawn carriage . The casino and the pavilion have been replaced by what our town officials consider suitable for a seaside " playground "  - -  parking lots and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still one of the most beautiful beaches in the world . I parked and walked along the sand , and my dog dashed about in great joy . On the mile-long stretch of beach , half a dozen other people were walking , with children and dogs racing around them . A flock of sandpipers mined the sand at the water 's edge . No nil on them , apparently . They flew easily when I approached . I looked out at the far-stretching flatness of the sea , which ended in a sharp line at the horizon . It was totally empty out there . I wondered how far out it was to the place where a tanker with thirty-eight sailors from Taiwan and eight million gallons of orl sank recently . I had heard someone on television surmise that most of the oil would stay solid in the cold depths , like a giant glob of Silly Putty , and roll around for years on the ocean floor . The Chinese sailors , floating peacefully dead , would n't last nearly so long . Sailors are more biodegradable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that scene more compellingly than any of the words I 'd read or heard spoken about the disaster . I wondered how many days the bird had swum and floated and endured to reach our shore with its message from way out there . As I was walking along thinking about this , I heard a roar , and a blue sports car carrying three young men whipped through the gate opening onto the beach . The car zoomed across the frozen sand and roared along , swaying and sashaying . As it passed me , scattering snow and sand , smashing down small dunes , just missing a dog , I saw the young men 's faces . They were having a wonderful time . That glimpse told me that the bird had brought its message in vain . AFTER a long period of silence , the friend we have come to think of as the Angry Man has written us to make another observation or two on public policy : Whichever bureaucrat invented the windchill factor should be sent outside without his mittens . If there 's anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the courage to go to work in three-degree weather , it 's that the windchill factor is making the three-degree weather feel like twentybelow-zero weather . How did we end up with a government that spends our tax money to pay people for concocting ways of persuading us that we 're even more miserable than we thought we were ? Why is it that cost overruns on bomber production are the only sort of information the government makes any effort to keep to itself these days ? It 's getting so I ca n't cat a simple hot dog without having some Bureau of Something-or-Other tell me what percentage of it is not beef but newt eyes or frog tails . They do n't bother to pass laws prohibiting the use of newt eyes in hot dogs , of course , they just rant about it . When they tell me on some gray August morning that the air in this city is " unacceptable , " they do n't follow up the information with any suggestions of alternate substances I might use for breathing that day . And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteorological people have devised for tormenting the general public . In the Midwest , they 've taken to badgering innocent citizens with something called the tornado watch . I happen to have grown up out there not far from where the tornado snatched up Dorothy Gale to deposit her in the Land of Oz  --  and the last few times I 've been back for visits I 've heard so much talk on the radio about tornado watches that I suspect that some people now consider it an act of courage in some seasons to come up out of the cellar for meals . There do n't seem to be any more tornadoes than there were when I was a child ( and I can remember only one besides Dorothy 's ) ? just more tornado watches . What I 'm trying to say is this : We have enough catastrophes that really happen , without being warned all the time about the ones that do n't . These fancy warning systems are just another thing for the bureaucrats to be wrong about : the watched tornado does n't roil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero is twenty below zero . ? ? Ceremony BETWEEN the Super Bowl and the Inauguration , we managed to squeeze in attendance at another conceivably major event of the early new year : an appeal to the world , from the summit of the Acropolis in Athens , to save the Parthenon and the other shrines standing on what in Greece is often called the Holy Rock . It seems that the Parthenon , the Erechtheum , the Propylaea , and the Temple of Athena Nike , or what remains of them , are gravely threatened by a variety of forces of disintegration . Between 1913 and 1931 , for instance , well-meaning but misguided caretakers embedded iron bars in some of the fragile ruins ; the bars have rusted , and the oxidation has caused expansion and cracked the surrounding marble . Human feet tramping across the area  --  some three million pairs of them a year now  --  are having their own debilitating effect . But the worst damage has come from pollution . The population of Athens has gone way up  --  to over two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last fifteen or twenty years the sulphur-dioxide emissions from residential oil heaters , automobiles , and factory stacks have done dreadful things to the cherished **28;5406;TOOLONG marble buildings . " It 's the same disastrous effect you get from putting vinegar on chalk , " we were told at the scene by G6rard Bolla , a deputy assistant director-general of UNESCO who is its man in charge of the world 's cultural heritage . This is not the first time , of course , that public concern has been expressed about the state of the Acropolis . In 1969 , UNESCO urged the government of Greece to take ameliorative steps before it was too late , but that was the government of the colonels , and they were mostly interested in preserving themselves . In 1974 , after their downfall , the new government named Constantine A. Trypanis its Minister of Culture and Sciences , and he at once set up the Working Group on the Preservation of the Acropolis Monuments . With its blessing , he had the three statues remaining on the west front of the Parthenon gently detached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This fall , Mr. Trypanis besought UNESCO  --  which was already helping with the rehabilitation of such venerated sites as Carthage and Borobudur  --  for technical and financial assistance , and at a meeting in Nairobi in November the agency pledged all-out support . This , if everything goes according to expectations , will involve the collection and expenditure , over a fiveto-ten-year period , of fifteen million dollars , much of it earmarked for detailed studies not only of the monuments themselves but of the holy bedrock on which they perch . Particularly difficult will be the precise location of the invisible reinforcing bars ( gamma-ray photography will be used ) , their removal ( a task as delicate as dentistry ) , and the substitution of bars made of a non-corroding alloy ( titanium alloy , probably ) . Also , the Greek government hopes to be able to persuade those of its citizens who live near the Acropolis to heat their homes with a fuel that creates less pollution . This month 's ceremony at the Acropolis was exceedingly low-key : no bands , no flags , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It took place on a cold , damp , gray morning . ( As the Director of the Acropolis , George Dontas , had noted sadly in September at an International Symposium on the Deterioration of Building Stones , held in Athens , it is very rare nowadays to find in wintertime one of ? ? the city 's legendary clear blue skies . ) Mr. Trypanis presided ; speaking in Greek , he said that " the buildings of the Acropolis of Athens , no matter how fully they express the spirit of the nation and of the period which created them , belong to the whole of humanity and are a symbol of the liberty of man as the peoples of the world see it today . " He thereupon introduced the guest of honor and chief fund-raiser , the Director-General of UNESCO , Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow , who , being Senegalese , spoke in French . " The Acropolis is in danger , " he began bluntly . Observing that " the treasures of the Acropolis testify in the highest degree to the creative genius of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for contributions to a special UNESCO fund from nations , foundations , museums , and individuals , including schoolchildren . Both men 's remarks were rendered in three languages  --  Greek , French , and English . During Mr. Trypanis 's Greek-to-French , Professor Emily Vermcule , the eminent Harvard archeologist , squinted at the western end of the Parthenon and told us , " In this light , you can see the curvature  --  k 's bending right up in the middle . " Trying vainly to sec it for ourself , we did see a single workman emerge from the Parthenon and , leaning against one of its dwarfing columns , take in the proceedings from that lofty vantage . During M. M'Bow 's Frenchto-Greek , we bowed to three diplomats from the People 's Republic of China ( would they soon , we wondered , be asking UNESCO to help restore the Great Wall ? ) , and said hello to some Australian schoolgirls , who just happened to be visiting the Acropolis that morning . At a reception for M. M'Bow and others downtown in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sorts we chatted with Mr. Trypanis , who looks like an English don , and who , indeed , taught Greek literature and language for twenty-five years at Oxford , before doing a seven-year stint at the University of Chicago . " Believing in democracy , I came back to Greece only when democracy was restored , " he said . " You know , one has the false feeling that classical monuments do not perish . Alas , they do . It 's the sculptured parts that suffer the most dramatic damage . If you compare recent photographs of the frieze of the west front of the Parthenon with photographs taken ten years ago , the difference is shocking  --  hands and arms and horses ' legs just falling off or melting away . " He said that the sculptures still in situ  --  the three remaining original caryatids of the Erechtheum , for instance  --  would be enshrined in a new museum , to be built at the base of the Acropolis as part of the current undertaking , and that the old museum would be torn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elgin Marbles back from the British Museum ? " I wish we could , " Mr. Trypanis said . He went on to say that the fundraising drive just launched had already produced a million drachmas ( thirty thousand dollars ) from American Express , three pounds from a Scottish schoolmaster , ten marks from a German woman tourist , and ten dollars from an American high-school class . Contributions in the United States , he added , can he made , tax-deductibly , through the International Fund for Monuments , a private organization based in New York . We had a final few words with the Director-General of utcESCO , who , although he once taught classics and history at the University of Dakar ( he was also for a while his country 's Minister of Education ) , had never before been to Athens . M. M'Bow said he had been profoundly impressed by the Parthenon . Driver GLEN LEE WELK , of Big Sandy , Texas , who has been chosen National Truck Driver of the Year by the American Trucking Associations , would have to be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Intergalactic Truck Driver of the Year if such competitive categories existed . We say this with no feeling of prejudice against any other nation 's or galaxy 's Truck Driver of the Year but because Olen Welk is as good a talker as he is a truck driver  --  and an index of his driving skill is that during the past forty-one years Mr. Welk , a heavy-haul specialist , has covered three and a half million miles without , as they say in the trade , " a single preventable accident . " We had a chance to gauge his talking skill when he came to town a couple of days before the Inauguration and invited us up to his suite in the Waldorf-Astoria . Mr. Welk and his wife , Hazel , arrived in New York after spending several days in Washington , where he was presented with a large trophy and a lapel pin signifying his new honor . Next to this pin he wore a tiny gold peanut pin , which he said he had bought " just to smart off . " Mr. Welk went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House tour on Tuesday , and on Wednesday the Federal Highway Administrator gave me the trophy . It 's a real nice trophy . I left it in Washington , and they 're going to ship it to me in Big Sandy . We stayed at the Statler Hilton  --  or , what 's it called , the Capital Hilton . They changed the name on us while we were staying there . " " We must have spent fifty dollars on peanuts in that town , " Hazel Welk said . " On Saturday , we bought a whole bunch for our grandchildren . We paid a dollar a can . Then we remembered we 'd forgotten some of the grand-kids , so we went back on Sunday to buy some more , and the only cans we could find cost a dollar-ninety-nine . Can you imagine ? We ended up getting peanuts for nine grandchildren ? No , twelve grandchildren  --  No , all fifteen , plus the great-grandkids . " " Well , it does n't matter now , " said Mr. Welk , " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Although Mr. Welk had been to New York before , while on the job , he admitted that chances were good he would get lost at some point during this visit . The idea did n't appeal to him very much . " Every time I come here , I feel just like a lost chicken from Texas , " he said . " First time was maybe 1942 or ' 43 . I was delivering a bunch of pecans , unloading ' em right in front of that store  --  Massey 's ? Oh , yeah , Macy 's . And policemen were all over me to get that shipment unloaded and move my truck quick . That trip was more trouble than I care to think about . That was back when I was driving for a couple of different freight lines , before I went to work for the C H Transportation Company , in Dallas . Back then , me and Mahauley ( that 's what I called all my trucks , Mahauley , except for the one that I drive now , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton and dog food , logs and lumber , crossties and blackberries . Those years , we ate a lot of water bread and water gravy . Then , in 1952 , I went to work for C &; H. I 've done very well since then . I bought a truck from C &; H in 1954 , and I owned five more until 1968 . Then I stopped owning trucks . Even though 1 do n't own the Red Racer , I still bring her home and park the cab in the front yard after I 've dropped off my trailer at the terminal . My first trip out for C &; H lasted six weeks , and I have n't had one that long since . I 've been to just about every state except Alaska and Rhode Island . " " And Hawaii , " said Mrs. Welk . " Do n't forget Hawaii . Our son was there in the Marine Corps . " " That 's how I got my CB radio handle  --  the Hawaiian Hitchhiker , " Mr. Welk explained . " See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a foot . " He took a piece of paper and drew a picture of a misshapen foot with an enormous big toe . " Down here at the heel , it 's made of lava , and the main part of the ashtray is in the big toe , and down in the sole of the foot I 've got it lettered ' Hawaiian Hitchhiker , ' in white shoe polish . It used to sit tight next to me in the cab of my truck , but now I leave it at home . I was afraid it might get broken . " Mr. Welk talked about his family  --  six children , the fifteen grandchildren , and two great-grandchildren  --  and his plans , which include continuing to drive trucks twentytwo years longer , until he 's eighty-five . He also expatiated upon the differences between " overdimension " freight loads and " legal " loads . At one point , he drifted hack to his childhood , and his school days in Garland , Texas , where , he claimed , one of his fellow-students was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind his parents too well , " he said , " so they sent him from Dallas over yonder to Garland to school . Jewel McCracken w-as our teacher , and everyone minded her . Clyde was the only kid in the school that had permission to smoke . One day , we got to playing together , because Clyde had gone outdoors for a cigarette and I was coming back from an errand . We found an old basketball and bounced it in the mud a few times and then started bouncing it off the schoolhouse wall , and pretty soon Miss McCracken came out and made us take wet paper towels and clean up that whole wall where the ball left marks . Clyde was n't a had kid in school just kind of mischievous . Slapping kids up the side of the head  --  that sort of thing . " After a pause , Mr. Welk glanced around his hotel suite . " How 's this hotel ? " he said . " Pretty fancy for a truck driver and his wife from Big Sandy , Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home is real dilapidated . Nobody uses it anymore . The Texas &; Pacific and Cotton Belt railroads cross at Big Sandy . That 's what puts the town on the map . There is n't really any river there , although Big Sandy Creek feeds into the Sabine River . " As Mr. Welk tipped his chair slightly in the sunlight , we noticed that he looks a bit like Buddy Elisen , the actor . When we mentioned the resemblance , he said , " Yeah , I know that . That reminds me  --  we went to sec that play Sly Fox ' last night , with George C. Scott . " " He was terrific , " said Mrs. Welk . " I 'd seen him on the TV but never in person . " " I used to drive with him back in the early days , " Mr. Welk said . " Now , do n't you go telling any fibs , " warned Mrs. Welk , and he did n't tell any more . Pop WE went to the opening of the Songwriters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 1 Times Square , last week and found a lot of people milling . The Hall of Fame , which occupies the building 's eighth floor , is a fluorescent-lighted , red-carpeted , white-walled place that is filled with memorabilia having to do with pop songs and show tunes . As we entered , Hoagy Carmichael was playing a lazy rhythmic pattern on Fats Waller 's old upright . We made our way through a chattering , cocktail-drinking crowd and looked at some exhibits , which included a pair of dancing shoes Gene Kelly wore in " An American in Paris " ( they look well ? worn ) , the first megaphone Rudy Vallee used in Maine ( it looks decrepit ) , Ted Lewis 's clarinet and cane , Johnny Mercer 's typewriter , one of Victor Herbert 's high desks ( he sometimes stood while composing ) , George Gershwin 's complicated desk ( it has a built-in wastebasket and a pencil sharpener ) , a guitar played by Mary Martin in " The Sound of Music , " a portrait of Eubie Blake , three Oscars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-portrait by Frank Loesser , and the sheet music of songs like " Moon River , " " I 'm Popeye the Sailor Man , " " The Way We Were , " " Happy Days Are Here Again , " " To Each His Own , " " This Land Is Your Land , " " The Sidewalks of New York , " " For Mc and My Gal , " " Once in Love with Amy , " " Hound Dog , " and " M-O-T-H-E-R . " After saying hello to the composers Gerald Marks and Johnny Marks ( who are not related ) and the lyricist Howard Dietz , we fell into conversation with Jude Styne , who wrote , ? among other things , the music for the musicals " Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , " " Bells Are Ringing , " " Funny Girl , " and " Gypsy . " Styne was in an ebullient mood . " If I seem tired , it 's because I was up late last night , " he said . " I 'm hooked in for two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few cultures we have , you know . We adopted painting , opera , and so forth from the other side of the ocean , but jazz and the popular song  --  that 's our music . The Songwriters ' Hall of Fame should project this idea in behalf of our songwriters , just as the Baseball and Football Halls of Fame do for our athletes . And the tradition that is celebrated here is being carried on by younger composers today . When was sixteen , playing piano in Chicago , Vincent Youmans walked up to me and told me I ought to write songs . I said I would never write songs  --  that was for old people . Well , look what happened . " Styne was whisked away to pose for
