A Soviet insider 's view of the coming war with China <P> The scenario is chilling . China 's ethnic minorities , which occupy some 60% of the nation 's territory , want to break away from Peking . The inhabitants of Inner Mongolia yearn to unite with the Mongolian People 's Republic and the Turkic peoples of Sinkiang with their cousins in Soviet Central Asia . " An exchange of blows , " as the author puts it , " may start at any moment . " When that happens , hundreds of thousands of " volunteers " on the Soviet side of the Chinese frontier will " come to the aid of their brothers in blood and in faith , " and the Soviet authorities will be unable to stop them . As the fighting spreads , the Chinese may attack Russia itself . The Soviets consider escalating to nuclear weapons . " It is difficult , " the author warns , " to overestimate the scale of the retaliation . . . " <P> If The Coming Decline of the Chinese Empire were the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turgidly written and historically inaccurate-for it is both of those-but it is in fact the work of Victor Louis , 50 , Moscow correspondent for the London Evening News , world traveler , bon vivant and a man widely reputed to have close connections with the Soviet KGB . The book thus can be interpreted as a Soviet government fantasy of China 's eventual political and geographical disintegration-and a rationale for direct Soviet military intervention . <P> One expert who so interprets it is Harrison Salisbury , who was asked by Times Books , a subsidiary of the New York Times and the publishers of Louis ' effort , to write an introduction . A onetime Moscow correspondent for the Times and author of a book entitled War Between Russia and China , he responded with a blistering attack . " Louis is a longstanding and experienced KGB agent , " Salisbury charges in a 14-page " dissenting introduction , " and his creation " is a book of spurious content , dubious logic , flagrant untruth . . . What confronts us is political perversity seldom seen . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tract " commands our attention . " <P> Louis claims to have worked on The Coming Decline for ten years , roughly the length of time since he became the first Soviet citizen in two decades to visit Chiang Kai-shek 's Taiwan , secretly , in late 1968 . His book , however , is virtually devoid of contemporary sinological research , not to mention eyewitness reporting . Louis draws on czarist-era studies to proclaim that nationalism is flourishing even in Manchuria , though the Manchus have virtually vanished as an identifiable ethnic group , largely because of overwhelming Han Chinese immigration for a century . At one point Louis admits this ; at another point he claims , preposterously , that the issue of Manchu nationhood is being debated " heatedly " by scholars . He even concocts a bizarre drama in which the Tibetan Dalai Lama takes up residence in the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator and rallies Tibetans and Mongols-who share the same kind of Buddhism-to separatism .
