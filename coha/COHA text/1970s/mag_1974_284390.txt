With good reason , some gloomy citizens in Saigon are by now convinced that the war in South Viet Nam will never end . Last week fighting between Communist and government troops reached its greatest intensity since the ineffective ceasefire , signed nearly two years ago . By week 's end the South Vietnamese army ( ARVN ) had suffered 706 killed and 2,758 wounded ; Saigon officials claim to have killed more than 3,600 of their enemies . <P> Most of the fighting was centered in the heavily populated and agriculturally rich Mekong River Delta area , known as Military Region IV . The Communists launched their attacks-primarily by rocket and mortar-against bridges , roads , district and provincial capitals , and government outposts manned by the increasingly feeble regional militia . Kien Tuong and Dinh Tuong provinces were particularly hard hit ( see map ) . Communists in Kien Tuong , using a shoulder-fired missile , shot down a huge Chinook helicopter , killing all 54 government troops aboard . A major target was Highway 4 , linking the Delta with Saigon . <P> Communist Gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which consists of the eleven provinces surrounding Saigon . The town of Cu Chi , the rear headquarters of the 25th ARVN Division , was shelled . Communist mortar and artillery attacks in Tay Ninh province , especially around Nui Ba Den ( Black Virgin Mountain ) , drove thousands of terrified refugees into already crowded Tay Ninh City . In Phuoc Tuy province , the Communists are attempting to gain control of several rubber plantations near the town of Long Thanh . Not far from there , they have organized the 301st Regiment of the so-called People 's Liberation Armed Forces . Government military analysts believe this new command will direct intensified attacks around Saigon . <P> The South Vietnamese have retaliated with air and artillery strikes and have dispatched ground forces to recapture outposts . The Communists , however , have held on to most of their gains . The major reason : ARVN now has to fight more Communist soldiers than it has ever faced in the long history of the Viet Nam War . Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces now number about 285,000 , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced the slow Ho Chi Minh Trail as a supply route , down which ammunition and replacements flow from the North . Since U.S. bombing in Indochina ended last year , the crack North Vietnamese army ( NVA ) 5th Division has been able to return to its traditional base area in the Parrot 's Beak inside Cambodia . There it poses a constant threat to Tay Ninh . <P> Saigon 's forces also face serious internal problems . The regional militia has frequently proved to be unreliable . So far this year , militiamen have abandoned 40% of their 2,500 outposts in the Delta . The morale of regular ARVN troops , which has seldom been high , has recently fallen even farther , due in part to the continuing corruption within the Thieu regime and among ranking military officers ( TIME , Nov. 11 ) . Moreover , Saigon 's economic squeeze-the result of the increased price of imported oil and a decrease in U.S. aid-has forced ARVN to economize on the battlefield . Many outposts are now limited to two artillery shells per day as a conservation measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missions by nearly three-quarters to save fuel .
