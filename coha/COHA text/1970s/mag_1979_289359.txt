TO BUILD A CASTLE-MY LIFE AS A DISSENTER by Vladimir Bukovsky Translated by Michael Scammell ; Viking ; 438 pages ; $17.50 <P> The literature of the Soviet Union 's political dissidents continues to crowd the imagination like a 19th century novel . Tolstoy , Dostoyevsky and Chekhov echo in the dramatic testimony of Solzhenitsyn , Sinyavsky , Daniel , Sakharov , Medvedev and Mandelshtam . Vladimir Bukovsky 's To Build a Castle adds the spirit of Lewis Carroll . His Soviet Union seems like a vertiginous rabbit hole lined in permafrost , or the other side of the looking glass , where the Red kings and queens of the Kremlin can sometimes be made to play by the rules . <P> There is no hope of mating such an opponent . Bukovsky , 36 , played only to guarantee his rights under the Soviet Constitution and Criminal Code . His gambit was to exchange a third of his life in prisons and psychiatric clinics for the dignity of saying nyet . It gained him an international reputation for incorrigible heroics . In 1976 the Soviet government solved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then a prisoner of the Pinochet dictatorship . Today Bukovsky lives in England , where he has resumed his frequently interrupted study of biology . <P> He will be remembered best as one of the great jailhouse lawyers . As a prisoner , with the right to petition any public official , Bukovsky clogged the arteries of bureaucracy with paper . His advice on how to tackle the system has universal application : " If you want your complaint to be examined by a high official , complain about his immediate subordinate ... And , most importantly of all , you should write enormous numbers of complaints and send them to the officials least equipped to deal with them . " One objective of these tactics was to cause unsightly bulges in the official statistics , " the most powerful factor of all in Soviet life . " <P> Thus Bukovsky exploited the rivalries and hidden disputes among the KGB , prison administrations , schools of psychiatry and political commissars . Legal affronteries never won him liberty but a different form of freedom : the ability to choose jail over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the harsh facts of imprisonment . " Every time I was released , " he writes , " my only thought was how to get as much done as possible , so that afterward , back in prison again . I would n't have to spend sleepless nights dwelling on lost opportunities . " <P> Bukovsky made one of his first decisions at the age of ten . He quit the Young Pioneers , the Soviet equivalent of the Cub Scouts . He had been asked to reprimand another boy , did it blisteringly well , felt ashamed of himself and decided that " I could n't and would n't play this idiotic role any longer . " At 14 he refused to join the Komsomol , and at 16 he was running with a harmless group of youthful Pimpernels who sympathized with the Hungarian uprising .
