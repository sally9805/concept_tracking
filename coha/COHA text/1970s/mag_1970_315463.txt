ONE of the insistent slogans of the day is that U.S. institutions are not " responsive " to people 's wishes . Thus the Electoral College is an easy target . <P> In designing a new nation , nothing perplexed the drafters of the Constitution quite so much as the question of how the President should be elected . As it turned out , the Electoral College devised by them has three times denied the country 's highest office to the candidate receiving the greatest number of popular votes . Twice it has resulted in , and several times-most recently in 1968-it has threatened the chaos of a disputed election 's being thrown to Con gress for resolution . Last year , in the wake of that recent near-fiasco , a pro posed constitutional amendment for direct election of the President was passed by the House of Representatives . Last week the Senate Judiciary Committee added its approval and sent the amendment to the floor for a debate that is expected to be long and bitter . Since the House vote , there have been some serious second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In theory , the direct-election scheme-titled the Bayh amendment after its chief sponsor , Indiana 's Senator Birch Bayh-is simplicity itself . The Electoral College would be abolished and the candidate who received the most votes would be the President . If no one got more than 40%-a situation that has happened only once in U.S. history*-there would be a runoff between the two who ranked highest . Majority will would always prevail , and a Wallace-like spoiler could no longer threaten to disrupt the system . In practice , however , things might not prove to be quite so simple . As the measure ( which , if approved , would still have to be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures ) passes to the Senate floor , opponents are arguing that it might well be even more chaotic and dissatisfying than the Electoral College system . <P> Consider , for instance , the drama of the absurd that could have resulted if the Bayh amendment had been ratified in early 1968 : <P> SCENE 1 . Rejected by the Democratic Convention , Senator Eugene McCarthy believes that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have scant chance of gaining even one vote in the discarded Electoral College , the new setup offers intriguing possibilities . <P> In a four-way race , he reasons , Wal lace might pick up 13% or 14% of the vote . Nixon might expect 38% or 39% , while McCarthy and Humphrey would divide the remainder . Since no one would get more than 40% , there would have to be a runoff ; McCarthy would have as good a chance as Humphrey to emerge as the man to oppose Nixon . The final race thus might very well be not Nixon-Humphrey but Nixon-McCarthy . The complications , however , do not end there .
