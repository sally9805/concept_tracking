THE UNCROWNED QUEEN <P> by ISHBEL ROSS 349 pages . Harper &; Row . $8.95 . <P> <P> " The splendour of her breasts , " wrote an early biographer , " made madmen everywhere . " He might also have mentioned her energy , ambition , courage , cunning , charm , wit and wardrobe . It took all those things , and plenty of gall besides , to turn Eliza Gilbert into Lola Montez , famous dancer , mistress of Franz Liszt and Alexandre Dumas pre , intimate of kings and prime ministers , de facto ruler of Bavaria during Ludwig I 's declining years , and belle of the California gold rush . <P> Who was Lola ? Rumor had it ( probably from Lola 's own lips ) that she was the daughter of Lord Byron ... or maybe of a matador . In fact , as this perfectly sober biography with a plot like a chambermaid 's dream shows , Lola was born in Limerick , Ireland , in 1818 , the daughter of an 18-year-old lieutenant and a 13-year-old chorine . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India . Shipped home to Scotland , the child appalled her stepfather 's Presbyterian parents by running naked through the streets . Hustled off to school in Paris , she perfected a homicidal temper and a gift for languages . At 19 , she eloped to Ireland with a lieutenant named Thomas James , who soon ran off with a captain 's wife . Eliza changed her name to Lola Montez , and under the protection of two great and good friends , Lord Malmesbury and Lord Brougham , made her stage debut in London as a Spanish dancer . The show closed , but a star was born . <P> At 25 , Lola was what the Victorians called " a superb piece . " She had skin like a Dresden shepherdess , hair like a black velvet shawl , eyes that flashed and flickered like sapphires in firelight . When a man got her Irish up , she cut him across the face with a riding whip . She once fired a pistol at a disappointing lover . What Lola wanted , Lola got . <P> In St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Czar , who gave her 1,000 rubles for services rendered . In Dresden , she got Liszt , the great lover of the age , and so wore him out that one night he locked her in a hotel room and fled , leaving a substantial sum to pay for the furniture he knew she would break . In Paris , she got culture and a taste for liberal politics in the company of Balzac , Lamartine , George Sand , Victor Hugo , and especially Dumas pre . She found the great love of her life , however , with a talented radical editor named Alexandre Dujarier . <P> He was soon killed in a duel , but he had somehow refined Lola 's primitive hunger for sex and power . In Munich , a year after Dujarier 's death , she opened the climactic episode of her career by striding unannounced into the study of King Ludwig I of Bavaria , an aging aesthete who had transformed his dowdy Munich into the Florence of the north . When the King asked the lady if her figure was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lola snatched up a pair of scissors and ripped open her bodice . " I am bewitched , " the King later told his council , " I know not how . "
