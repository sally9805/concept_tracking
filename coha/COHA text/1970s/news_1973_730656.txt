txt The Mekong Either and its tributaries wander tortnotody from Tibet and China down through North Vietnam . Laos . Thailand and Cambodia until the river flows in three great channels into the South China Sea south of Saigon . For millions of years , the Mekong dredged up silt along its course and deposited it to form the delta that spreads south and west of Saigon . The delta 's thousands of square miles are some of the world 's richest farmland  --  all of it endowed with fertile soil , abundant water and a warm climate that allows three crops a year . But for all that natipe has endowed , hundreds of thousands of acres of once-productive rice-farming land in the delta lie abandoned . the fields choked with weeds whose tenacious roots resist the Vietnamese farmers ' efforts to dig them out . And even the millions of productive acres left are threatened by cro ? - killing saltwater intrusion . An ingenious and vast system of dikes and canals that was built by the former French owners of Inanerana and that kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , then , is part of the tragedy of the Vietnam war . The conflict , which for the past 30 years has swept back and forth across the delta and the rest of Vietnam , has meant that dikes and canals were ignored to pay for guns and tanks . Making Up for Decades If the fragile accord brings real peace here  --  and there is n't complete conviction that it will  --  reconstructing Vietnam will mean not only repairing the physical war damage but also catching up with decades of neglect as well . Vietnam has fallen far behind economically developing Asian neighbors that , although not nearly as well-endowed with natural resources , have n't had to waste efforts fighting a war . It might be premature , with peace still Lmcertain , to ask what it will take to rebuild Vietnam . The question has already occurred to the Nixon administration , which has made an undefined pledge of $7.5 billion in reconstruction aid to all Indochina over the next five years . Other nations , too , are being premed to help pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , either on the American or the Vietnamese side  --  and both sides have squads of planners busily preparing estimates of the needs for reconstruction-will hazard a guess on how much it will cost or how law it will take . In general , however , the Vietnamese indicate that they fear the Americans will try to get away cheap . " When Foster Dulles told us that the Com =mists were monsters , we believed him , and we went out and fought them , " says ! Chuang Hun Dieu , the American-educated director of the Vietnamese Industrial Development Bank . " But now , " he scowls , " when we have been shattered and we try to rebuild ... pssbaaaw ! " The United States , he says , refuses to make a long-term aid commitment , and what it does promise is insufficient and of the wrong type . U.S. aid officials say the Vietnamese fears are overdrawn but concede that there is some substance to what the Vietnamese say . Off the record , U.S. officials blame Congress for attaehing too many strings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's involvement in. the Vietnam war has created Lmfair animosity against his country in the U.S. The Narrow &; the Broad View - Narrowly defined , postwar reconstruction means repairing the physical damage caused by the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong as well as that of the allies , whose massive firepower wreaked most of the destruction . Fonds would have to be spent on chewed-up roads and railways , on blown bridges and bombed canals , and on destroyed towns such as Quang Trt and An Loc . But " nearly , that 's not the whole definition of reconstruction , " says Willard Sharpe , chief of the American Agency for International Development 's joint economic office . " Actual war damage is probably just a $100 million , oneyear problem " The real costs will come in resettling hundreds of thousands of refugees displaced during the war ; in demobilizing and retraining for civilian jobs many of Saigon 's 1.1 miliionman armed forces ; in bringing back into production lands and crops abandoned because of the fighting ; in repairing water systems , dikes , and electrical-power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in humanitarian programs for wounded veterans , widows , orphans and other victims of the war . Millions of Vietnamese have been displaced during the pasrdecade , most by the deliberate policy of moving villagers out of Communist . controlled areas . Official estimates say almost 700,000 Vietnamese are in refugee camps , maintained at a cost to the government of shoat $1 million a month . Conditions , in most cases , are the minimum needed to survive . The figures do n't include " resettled " refugees , who , if peace is lasting , may want to return to their home villages , where , as do most Vietnamese peasants , they have strong ties . One scheme being discussed for resettling reagent would be to put many of them on the estimated 740,000 acres of abandoned rice land that because of the war has been unused for as long as two decades . Self-sufficiency in rice can be attained , although the old French dike and canal system in the delta is falling apart , officials say . Failure of the dikes , built to keep out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were once possible , farmers in some areas now must wait for the rainy season to wash away the salt before they can plant ; thus , they are limited to one crop . Many of the French-built shipping canals have silted up , meaning that small boats must be used to transport the rice rather than the larger barges the canals were designed for . Rubber , which is still Vietnam 's No. 1 export despite the war , will take longer to reach prewar levels . Most of the trees are over age , and new plantings take seven years to become productive . Planners are n't placing too much emphasis on rubber , however , in view of the low world price and the increased use of synthetic rubber . A major effort , if the planners have their way , will be in developing new industries . Fisheries are a good possibility , with Vietnam 's offshore waters said to be teeming with =exploited schools of marine life . Others are forest products , including vast tracts of pine and various hardwoods said to be competitive with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are other possibilities . And offshore petroleum deposits may be located when test holes are dog in a year or two . All these natural resources will be exploited to the fullest , especially if they have export possibilities . The reason is obvious . South Vietnam last year imported a whopping $700 million of goods , most of it financed by the U.S. But South Vietnam exported only $23 million of rubber , sea products , pinewood , " discarded items " and duck feathers . ( Duck feathers are a whole other story , but suffice it to say they go to Japan and Europe for comforters and pillows . ) Exports this year , it is hoped , will double , still leaving Vietnam with a massive balance-of-payments deficit . Because the U.S. finances most of that deficit , it 's no wonder that American officials are pressing other nations , especially Japan , to assume some of the burden . Until now , most of Japan 's aid , amounting to $36 million in 1971 but dropping to $13 million last year , has been in humanitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the like . " The Japanese are being extremely circumspect about aid , " one American official says . " There 's a serious danger that the Japanese may try to limit their aid to beds-and-blankets stuff . That 's good , but it really is n't what 's needed . We 'd like to see them kick in $100 million of balance-of-payments assistance instead . " The official does see some sort of international consortium providing Infloc  --  hina with reconstruction help . Seeking Japanese Investment The Americans are n't the only ones pressing the Japanese to aid Saigon . Vietnam is , too  --  and with good reason , for most of Vietnam 's trade deficit is with Japan . Last year the Japanese sold $100 million of goods to Vietnam and bought $10 million ; in 1971 Japan sold the Vietnamese $143 million while purchasing $2 million . Saigon has been pressing Japanese businessmen to invest in Vietnam and to buy more Vietnamese goods . The Vietnamese " complain that Japanese businessmen only sell goods and do n't buy , " says the first secretary of the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nishimura says , is " still the big obstacle " to Japanese investment .
