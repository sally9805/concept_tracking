txt It was , come to think of it . an improbable pilgrimage to begin with - the editor of The Wall Street Journal seeking out Gunnar Myrdal , the democratic world 's most prominent critic of the capitalist order . So a bit of disorientation was perhaps not surorisine . Professor Myrdal 's address is in Stockholm 's Old Town . the ** city now splondidly redeveloped into boutiquelined alleys The apartment door presents an array of buzzers-along with burglaralarm warnings . law and order being a political issue in Sweden-but none of them raises an answer . At length a phone call from a helpful neighbor prevails , and the door opens into an impressive duplex . the top floor an airy den bedecked with South Asian artifacts . The problem , it turns out . was that the appointment interrupted a physical therapy session for ailing 80-yearold legs , and the Nobel laureate appears in gown and slippers. relights a half-smoked cigaret and settles comfortably back for a long chat . Even a - listener who does not always agree has to be impressed by the independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Myrdal 's work-from an architect of the Swedish welfare state . to the landmark race relations study " An American Dilemma . " to the exhaustive treatise on development . - Asian Drama , , " But in this chat the overpowering thing is a matter of temperament , especially in contrast to some of his cootemporaries who have argued the other side . In both Friedrich Hayek , who shared the 1974 economics Nobel with Mr. Myrdal , and Ent Lundberg . Sweden 's eminent defender of capitalism , one finds a cheery stoicism But after a lifetime devoted to social reform . Professor Myrdal sees the world with a profound pessimism . - In 1974 and ' 75 Sweden lived in euphoria. - be complains in explaining economic difficulties in Sweden . which was hit worse by the remit downturn than any other developed nation A raw materials boom pushed up prices for iron and forest prtdoct exports , and the Norwegian oil remises boosted Swedish manufactures .

But while praising the ability of Sweden 's centralized labor bargaining to make this adjustment . Mr. Myrdal worries that it may be overtaken by more pressing events . " You tell me how we 're going to do something about this problem of the dollar , " be demands . " You send out dollars like hell all over the world , and it 's ending up in private hands . " he complains , worrying that a few big shots can " meet over lunch " and wreck the currency . " I 'm scared of this dollar thing , it is very horrible for the whole world . " he says . " I belong to those who are scared of a recession coming , and it could be a very serious one , if the dolWhat about another problem . the visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the highest taxes in the world , with high absenteeism in Industry and a growing black market . Professor Myrdal has recently complained that the taxes are turning Sweden into a nation of " hustlers " and called for nothing less than the end of the progressive income tax . Asked about these views , he tells the American . " That 's a little special thing . " Nobel laureates are not fools , and Mr. Myrdal hastens to head off a journalistic theme : " While we in national elections and even in local elections have 90% or more of the voters voting , you are happy to get 50% in a presidential election ; perhaps 30% in a congressional race . " He adds , " You talk of tax revolt : it 's the upper middle class . They are the ones who are voting . " He warns , " One should be very careful trying to see similar movements in different countries , they are so different . " In fact , Mr. Myrdal has no desire to cut taxes , merely to rearrange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praises the criticism of the present system in the Myrdal article , for example , but disparages the suggestion of replacing the progressive income tax with a progressive consumption tax and a progressive wealth tax . " The whole point of the consumption tax is to exclude savings . " Mr. Lundberg says , " and if you attack the savings accumulations with a wealth tax you are back in the same place he has n't analyzed it . " One side of the tax debate , though , does exercise Mr. Myrdal . His proposals are not faring well in the internal debate of the Social Democratic Party ; its leaders are interested in the alternative of a production tax . He remembers when his party was " really a people 's movement , " but this has been ruined by " this yod-damn television . " Politically , television is " a horrible thingit fixes attention on one man , the party leader . " And Social Democratic leader Olaf Palme has " fallen for this . He gives a party line even when we are split . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now sits all year , and you are " getting professional politicians . " Even worse than anything in Sweden , though , is what is happening in the developing world , the most recent focus of attention for Mr. Myrdal and his wife and collaborator Alva . The shah had his faults , the socialist philosopher reckons , " but now the mullahs will take over , and that 's very anti-development . " Similar things are already happening in Turkey and Pakistan ; " the bad things that are happening are contagious . " In India , he continues , the peon . voted out Mrs. Gandhi 's government for failing to carry through on its development promises , and will vote against the present one for the same reason . Burma is a special tragedy , " it was a very rich country . " Under Marcos , the Philippines " could be another Iran at any time . " In country after country . " there is a general disaffection with authority . " " We have a hell of a time ahead of us ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Myrdal concludes . He thinks back on 60 years of collaboration with his wife ; " We shared our development together . " He observes , " Alva and I have always been Enlightenment philosophers , " the very last word in " An American Dilemma " was " Enlightenment , " with a capital E. The Enlightenment philosophy is an optimistic one , he adds , and laments , " Now we see that the world is going to hell , now that we 're going to die . "
