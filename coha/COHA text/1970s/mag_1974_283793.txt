Residents of Canton , Ill. ( pop . 14,000 ) , regulated their lives according to the seven blasts heard each day on the town 's whistle , perched on top of the local International Harvester plant . They awakened to the first morning whistle at 6 a.m. , set their watches by it , and moved in steady , sure steps throughout the day , alert to the whistle 's sound . The Environmental Protection Agency heard in the whistle not the sound of a community ordering its hours but a D.B.A. ( for decibels adjusted ) measurement of 89 , 28 points higher than the limit allowed by a state noise-pollution law slated to go into effect in February 1975 . <P> There was already on the books a state nuisance law EPA could apply to the whistle , so they wrote Plant Manager Robert Nelson warning him that he could be in violation of the new law . Nelson cooperated by promptly shutting down the whistle . The town schedule went haywire : men were late for work , women got their children off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appear at the appointed times . <P> Within 48 hours after the shutdown , 7,000 persons had signed petitions protesting the silencing of the whistle . As a consequence , it was turned back on . Said an EPA spokesman : " We were just reacting to a complaint and seeing if we should do anything about it . There is obviously not much nuisance if the majority of people like the whistle . "
