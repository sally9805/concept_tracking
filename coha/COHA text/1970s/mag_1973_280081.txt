The lushly flowered city of Guadalajara has long been considered a prize post by American diplomats : the climate seems like eternal spring , the ambience is relaxed and the U.S. consul general 's home is a monument to comfortable living . From now on , though , Foreign Service officers may be a bit apprehensive about the assignment . Two weeks ago , while returning home from a local police exhibition on law enforcement , U.S. Consul General Terrance Leonhardy ( a 21-year career man ) was kidnaped by four armed men . An hour after he was spirited away , ransom notes turned up , demanding on behalf of the " Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People " that 30 political prisoners be released from prisons across the country and flown to Cuba . Warned the terrorists : " Any delay in fulfilling these demands will result in the execution of the bourgeois who is in our hands . " <P> The revolutionaries had other demands as well . They wanted their Marxist-lining manifesto published on the front pages of leading dailies throughout Mexico . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear on national television and report the safe arrival in Havana of the 30 compaeros . They also warned that there was to be no army or police mobilization in the Guadalajara area while negotiations were going on . <P> For both the U.S. and Mexican governments , the dilemma was cruel . To give in to the terrorists ' demands cut against the grain of President Nixon 's **26;1701;TOOLONG policy , enunciated in 1971 in connection with the kidnaping of four U.S. airmen by leftist terrorists in Turkey . To Mexican authorities , the release of 30 imprisoned terrorists to Cuba meant , in all likelihood , that the revolutionaries would soon be back in action in the country . <P> Although Washington stood firm , Mexican President Luis Echeverra decided to bow to the demands . " Mexico will accede , " he said , " because the essential thing is to protect the U.S. consul general 's life . " ( Only six months before , five Mexican guerrillas were released from prison after their comrades hijacked a domestic Mexicana airline flight and demanded that all be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican official put it , " allowing the terrorists to kill the consul general would have been tragic for U.S.-Mexican relations . It would have cost Mexico dearly in American investment and in our $1 billion-a-year U.S. tourist trade . " <P> Demand . The deal was made : the 30 prisoners flown to Havana , the proclamation duly printed , the police leashed . Cuba 's charg d'affaires appeared , as specified , on television to report that the freed rebels had safely arrived in Havana . But then Leonhardy 's captors made an additional demand for his freedom : $80,000 in ransom money . A day later , the ransom was paid ; nine hours afterward , Leonhardy was found , exhausted and unshaven , in a Guadalajara street . He called his 76-hour captivity a " terrible ordeal . I prayed a lot . I did n't know when they might put a bullet through my head . "
