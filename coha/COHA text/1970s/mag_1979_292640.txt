Haig and Brown and 1980 <P> More than a year before the first primaries , many a presidential straw is in the wind . Two current examples : &gt; " I can say categorically that I have no political plans at the moment , but of course in the future I never exclude anything . " <P> So said General Alexander M. Haig , 54 , in announcing last week that he will resign in June as Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and retire from the U.S. Army . His sudden announcement to quit was something of a surprise to President Carter , who last fall had asked Haig to stay for another year in the NATO post he has held since 1974 . It stirred speculation that he is getting ready to run for the Republican presidential nomination . <P> Haig was one of the fastest rising officers in the Army during the Nixon Administration , going from lieutenant colonel to four-star general in a little over five years , largely because of his performance as top aide to Henry Kissinger on the National Security Council . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H.R. Haldeman as White House Chief of Staff . When Nixon became increasingly preoccupied with Watergate , Haig served at times as a sort of surrogate President and was one of the few high-level Nixon aides to survive the crisis without damaging his career . <P> As NATO commander , Haig has won high praise from European leaders and the Carter Administration for his efforts to strengthen the alliance 's defenses . But he disagreed with Carter 's decision to delay development of the neutron bomb , and has expressed serious misgivings about the SALT II treaty . His tough anti-Soviet stance makes him attractive to some Republicans . But party pros say Haig 's closeness to Nixon and the Watergate crisis will hurt his presidential chances , though they think he might make a strong candidate for the U.S. Senate , depending on where he settles when he returns to the U.S. <P> &gt; California Governor Jerry Brown is determined not to make the same mistake he did in 1976 , when he waited too long to enter the race and never was able to catch up with Carter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has decided to run , " I 'm going to go , " he said . " I 'll start early , March or April . I 'm not going to sit back and wait . " <P> His plan is to enter selected Democratic primaries , including some early contests in the East , to test Carter 's vulnerability . But Brown 's main concern is Ted Kennedy , who he fears could reap the benefit of Brown 's own early challenge to Carter . The worry is well founded . The latest Mervin Field poll shows that among California Democrats , 44% favor Kennedy as their party 's nominee . Carter trails badly with 22% ; Brown comes in last with 21%.
