txt Less than a year after its opening , the trans-Alaskan pipeline has produced a vast oversupply of oil on the West Coast . That problem , and related ills have turned out to be more serious than even the ' pipeline 's critics foresaw and have led top Federal energy officials to consider swift remedial action . The oversupply is a reflection of overoptimistic estimates of oil demand in Western states , the failure of several.major refiners to use any Alaskan production , tighter environmental restrictions on oil used by Western states and continued imports of large quantities of ' foreign oil . As a consequence , oil production within California has suffered significantly . The need to move unexpectedly large quantities of oil has pushed tanker rates 50 percent above predictions . The price of the oil has fallen short of projections loci profits for the companies producing on the North Slope have fallen far short of earlier estimates . Situation Expected to Worsen " There are a number of problems , no doubt about that , " said John Lichtblau , executive director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation is expected to worsen as the effects of a recent 50 percent increase in North Slope production begins to be felt . For the longer term , the oversupply and its ramifications seem likely to persist at least , for several years , although changes in Feder- al regulations could ease the symptoms . Secretary of Energy James R. Schlesinger is known to be increasingly concerned , - about the West Coast problem . Last week , his department-held two days of hearings at Huntington Beach on the California - related effects , an aspect which has been raised to a political level by the involvement of California 's Gover nor , Edmund G , Brown Jr . Ultimately , department officials believe that the Alaskan problem must be dealt with as part of a broad restructuring of the oil transportation system in the United States , a restructuring made essential by changed realities since the 1973-74 oil embargo . The West Coast situation is also reflective in an extreme way of the general state of the world oil business : frequent oversupply encouraged by the higher prices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next decade . While the likelihood of a West Coast glut was apparent even before the pipeline opened , the extent and impact of the current excess have surprised most analysts . For example , the Federal Energy Administration estimated a year and a half ago that the West Coast would be able to absorb 800,000 barrels a day of the oil , currently being produced at a rate of 1.1 million barrels a day . In reality , a number of analysts agree , the current potential is actually about 550,000 . Whatever remains must be shipped at high cost through the Panama Canal to the Gulf Coast . , Tighter Environmental Standards In part , the oversupply results from a tightening of California 's environmental standards which forces refiners to use lower sulfur Indonesian oil . The Stencil and Oil Company of California estimates this has reduced its potential use of Alas . kan oil by about 75,000 barrels a day . At the same time , unexpectedly large quantities of hydroelectric power and natural gas have been available , reducing demand for fuel oil . With ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without Alaskan production  --  including Shell , Texaco , any Alaskan oil . And while West Coast imports are down substantially in recent ports are down substantially in recent ' months , they still total 700,000 barrels a day . " We have no production in Alaska , ' therefore we are not . putting anything into the line , therefore we are not taking anything out for our refineries , " said a ' spokesman for Gulf . In addition , white SoCal  --  with no significant North Slope interest  --  has spent ' several hundred million dollars to install special refinery equipment , companies similarly situated have spent virtually nothing . Perhaps the most criticized company has been Shell , with 300,000 barrels a day of refinery capacity on the West Coast . A Shell spokesman cited " contractual supply commitments " although he maintained the , company " anticipated " refining " some " . North Slope oil " in the near future . " For California producers , whose output totals about 10 percent of the nation 's supply , the appearance of Alaskan oil has meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been competing hard , meaning no price or purchase increases and , in some cases , cutbacks . " The Alaskan production has not backed out Indonesian oil , it 's backed out Californian , " said J. Kenneth Cory , State Controller . For the companies producing Alaskan oil  --  principally Standard Oil Company ( Ohio ) , Exxon , and Atlantic Richfield ? the oil has also been a disappointment . The cost of moving the oil through the Panama Canal is mow nearly $3.50 a , barrel , compared with less than $2.50 estimated by the F.E.A. en mid-I976 . Moreover , availability of quantified , Americanflag vessels is tight and some analysts believe a shortage could appear this summer . At the same time , the selling price appears to be below expectations , a subject that companies are reluctant to discuss . Analysts believe that although complicated swapping arrangements devised by companies offer takers of Alaskan oil favorable terms , the producers are intent . on avoiding outright price cutting .. " If the oil is priced properly , the technology is there to desulfurize and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Energy official here who has studied the situation extensively . Price Levels Compared At present , the on Is said to be selInh for about $13.25 a barrel after transportation charges are paid , compared with about $13.50 for higher-quality Saudi Arabian light . By comparison , in - state California crude sells for only about $10 to $11 a barrel on the open market , be . cause of its lower quality , but , with high transportation charges , the Alaskan oil only nets the producers $4 to ' $5 a barrel at the well head . Curiously , the exemption of Alaskan oil from Federal price controls means its fate is tied to foreign oil and the price increases posted by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries over the last year have been below expectations , with even price-cutting appearing in some cases . For Salo , with 54 percent of the production , the impact has been substantial . Its stock price has tumbled by onethird in recent months as analysts cut their profits estimates . One , Joel Fisher of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from $4.37 in 1977 but well down from $12 estimated a year ago . For Exxon and Arco  --  the other major North Slope producers  --  the impact has been less substantial . For one thing , Alaska is a much smaller part of their total business . For another , both have been able to use all their North Slope supplies on the West Coast , although Exxon says that the recent production increase may leave it with a surplus . Mr. Fisher and others noted that , although both Exxon and Arco had built refineries especially ' to handle the North Slope flow , Sohio had done little besides proposing a pipeline from Long Beach to Texas . Critics frequently charge Sohio with attempting to force permission to export the oil to Japan , permission that was denied , by Congress . While the industry and the Carter Administration agree that an exchange with Japan would be beneficial , the Administration is unwilling to hike on Congress over the issue . Instead , the Administration is considering ' alternatives within its power , such ' as the Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
