Situated just off Route 250 in Wooster , Ohio is a narrow , brick-and-glass structure with hay bales protruding from behind . Except for the hay , the place looks like the offices of a computer company . It is n't . It 's a school where , on one recent morning . Greg Sautter sat in his classroom listening to seniors present oral reports . Students slumped at their desks , booted feet stretched into the aisles . A faint yet persistent odor wafted through the room . // " Dudley 's learning to relax coming off the track , " drones one student . " He does n't have much pace , though . " // Sautter interrupted , " Well , remember the Melvin 's Woe filly last year .... " // Horses . That 's the permeating smell as well as the all-encompassing subject matter . The class is part of the Horse Production and Management Department of Ohio State 's Agricultural Technical Institute . ATI has no campus to speak of , just the lone classroom building and  --  down the road at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of animals . The nine-year-old college offers an associate 's degree in soil management and livestock studies . The horse department is ATI 's biggest drawing card and . though an equitation program is available , it is the harness-racing classes that lure hopefuls from states as far away as California . // Under the direction of Sautter and five other teachers , the two-year , junior-college program includes required courses in math , English and chemistry besides providing a combination kindergarten-prep-school apprenticeship for hopeful trainers . Students , some of whom have never seen a horse before , learn equine anatomy , nutrition and shoeing as well as basic stall mucking . " We teach the study of the total horse , " says Sautter. // Anyone interested in earning a living in the horse-racing business must first learn the rudiments somewhere , and without a program like ATI 's , aspiring horsemen can only hunt for the lowliest stall-sweeping work and hope for that big break . In the racing world , that usually happens with glacial speed . ATI does n't guarantee any student a career as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a way to begin a little higher and progress a lot faster . " ATI grads have done just that , landing beginning trainer and driver positions in stables belonging to Billy Haughton . Stanley Dancer and a score of other respected horsemen . // To prepare for those jobs , students first must learn the basic work done in any racing stable . At ATI , 28 standardbreds and twice as many undergraduates begin their day at seven . Students pick out hooves , soap leather , rub sore legs . They learn to jog the horses around a half-mile track and to keep meticulous charts of each animal 's daily condition , medication and training routine . Though Sautter is around to offer advice , student barn managers are assigned to maintain order and supervise a work schedule that goes on until the evening 's last feeding . // Such arduous days are a new way of life for most ATI scholars . In fact , exhaustion contributes heavily to the program 's 40% drop-out rate during the freshman year . " It 's easy for someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed them on weekends or take care of a sick one on Christmas , " Sautter says . " This is the place to find out if he can handle it . " // Students who remain in ATI 's harness program soon learn to build their days around horses . If their charge is racing out of town , understanding profs often excuse them from a math or chemistry class . Skipping school to see a horse race may sound like cutting classes to go fishing , but at ATI it 's part of the exploration of the total horse . // Not that the school makes going to the races all that easy . For one thing , the ATI horses are rather nondescript creatures . " We tell these kids anyone can win with a good horse , " says Sautter , " but if you can make something of a poorer one , you 're a real horseman . " All standardbreds in the barn belong to outside owners who opted to have them student-trained rather than shelling out to an established professional . Though it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shown by the steadily increasing number of horses under the school 's care . // There is , however , some resentment toward the " horse classroom " by some oldtimers in the harness-racing industry , men who came up the hard way , learning to race with their father 's buggy and farm horses . " They 'll tell you , ' Schooling is O.K. , but our way is better , ' " Sautter says . " Well , there 's a response to that : How many buggies and farm horses are available today ? What about city kids who 've never been near a horse ? Go ask some trainer how many people he 'd hire who have never put a harness on a horse before . " // Despite this pocket of resistance , ATI 's reputation and status are growing . At nearby Scioto Downs , students claim mere mention of the school can lock up a job in minutes . And Sautter is confident that his program 's graduates will continue to command attention and respect . " People recognize only results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our horses . If all we do is talk , why should anybody believe us ? This way , they see for themselves what we can do .
