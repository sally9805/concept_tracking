It was the cleanest thing that happened all month . The 63rd running of the Indianapolis 500 roared out from under the cloud of legal hassles and inter-organizational acrimony that had poisoned the scene since the beginning of May and became one of the finest , safest and swiftest races ever run . In fact , it was two races for the price of one , and each of them a beaut. // Overall victory went to a fresh face at the Speedway , 27-year-old Rick Mears of Bakersfield , Calif. , in Roger Penske 's red , white and blue Gould Charge . Mears , a onetime off-road-racing champion who was in only his second year at Indy , had sat on the pole , but for most of the going the lead belonged to either Al or Bobby Unser . Aside from three laps at the front during a spate of fuel stops early in the grind , it was n't until the final 18 laps that Mears had the lead . By then , four-time Indy winner A. J. Foyt had worked his way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a lap down to the leaders , and he was the only other driver on the same lap with young Mears . But A.J. had overtaxed his engine playing catch-up and there was no way he could mount much of a final charge . // " I just do n't know what to say , " Mears said in the hubbub of celebration in the garage area . " This is totally unbelievable to me . " As well it might be . It has been only eight months since he graduated from a school that specializes in honing race drivers ' skills . // Usually , the main concern of fans and drivers alike as race day approaches is the flighty Indianapolis weather , and this year was no exception . But worse than the threat of rain was the legal situation , which culminated on Thursday with an army of process servers invading Gasoline Alley and serving subpoenas on nearly everyone in sight . Then on Saturday , to placate the 11 car owners who had brought the latest legal action  --  they felt the United States Auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of qualifying and therefore had not given them a fair chance to get into the field  --  a unique extra qualifying session was held . Two more drivers went fast enough to enlarge the field from the traditional 33 cars to 35 . The added starters were Billy Vukovich ( who finished eighth ) and George Snider ( who went out on the seventh lap with a broken fuel line ) . // The weather turned perfect for racing by sunrise on Sunday  --  cool , clear and nearly windless . With former Grand Prix champion Jackie Stewart at the wheel of the pace car , the start was almost letter-perfect . Al Unser , sitting on the outside of the first row in Jim Hall 's new Chaparral-Cosworth , showed his savvy at the drop of the green flag . He dived down off the high line through Turn 1 and hit the short chute in the lead . The new Chaparral had been the center of attention since it showed up at the Speedway . For one thing , there was its eye-grabbing chrome-yellow paint job , but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ground effects " car in the race , its underside sculpted to produce suction that not only held the car tight through the corners and reduced aerodynamic drag on the straights , but also caused less wear on the tires , which cuts down on time-consuming tire changes . // " The Chaparral is 100% ground effects , " said one Chaparral team member . " The new Penske car , the one driven by Bobby Unser , is about 65% . " The Chaparral 's advantage showed clearly through the first half of the race . By the ninth lap of the 200 that comprise the race , Al Unser had opened up a five-second lead on Mears , who had chosen to drive a more conventional , older Penske , and at times his bulge stretched out to 15 seconds . // One of the more nagging worries during the early going was what Danny Ongais would do . The former drag racer knows no fear when it comes to speed . But he had hit the wall in Turn 4 during practice for qualifying , spent two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pack on the second weekend . Many Ongais watchers feared that he would make a banzai charge from his starting spot on the outside of the ninth row . But the rugged Hawaiian behaved himself and went on to run a smart , smooth race . Despite handling problems with his car late in the race , Ongais finished third behind Mears and Foyt and ahead of Bobby Unser , who came in fourth . // Another worry was driver behavior during the inevitable yellow-flag caution periods . In recent years , when the yellow came out , automatic pacing lights flashed around the track , and drivers were supposed to keep the same interval between cars throughout the caution period . This year USAC decided to borrow a leaf from Grand National stock car racing . When the yellow came out , so did the pace car . Thus , drivers could dive into the pits under the yellow , refuel , change tires , fix minor glitches , then charge back out into the pack swarming behind the pace car . This kind of ruling permits races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a manner that was impossible under the old procedure . The fear was that drivers might try to sneak past the pace car and pick up a " free " lap . But it happened only once . Wittingly or unwittingly , Vern Schuppan of Australia slipped past the pace car and was penalized two laps . // While Al Unser built up his lead , the casualties began among the lesser machines . Janet Guthrie , normally a fine conservator of engines and chassis , was the first starter to go , with a burned piston on the fourth lap ( Jim McElreath had been unable to get his car running long enough to even take the green flag ) . She disappeared into Gasoline Alley with tears in her eyes , but then composed herself and took the disappointment , er , personally . Wally Dallenbach was soon to follow , but more spectacularly . With the yellow caution lights blinking as a tow truck dragged Cliff Hucul 's car off the track with a broken engine , Dallenbach lost his right rear wheel in Turn 2 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // As the race approached the halfway point , it appeared that defending champion Al Unser would be home free for back-to-back victories , matching his triumphs in 1970 and ' 71 . But no one is ever home free at Indy . Suddenly , Unser 's Chaparral began spewing oily blue smoke through the corners . Unser pitted quickly , then went back out . This time a trail of flame burst out from the back of the Chaparral . That was all for Al . He had led 85 of the 96 laps the car had run . Race No. 1 was over . The sophisticated Chaparral had sprung a transmission seal , one of the most unpredictable sorts of failures and one usually associated with poorly prepared cars . Yet Unser , who had won four straight 500-mile races dating back to 1977 , remained philosophical , at least in public . " It 's a shame to have a race car as good as this one , " he said , " and then to have something so small happen to put it out . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // With one Unser down , the other took charge . Bobby grabbed the lead , with Mears right behind him , and Race No. 2 was on . Tom Sneva and Foyt lay a bit farther back , with Ongais closing in on them . Bobby Unser had started on the inside of the second row , but he had n't looked particularly quick in practice . Evidently , he was saving it for the real thing . Turning laps in excess of 187 mph , he burned through the groove as if on rails . // Meanwhile , back in the pits , another of the Speedway 's patented frustration scenes was being played . Two-time winner Johnny Rutherford had been running a canny race and , using the yellow caution periods to full advantage , he had made his way up to third place . Then , pulling out of the pits under the yellow flag that had been caused by Al Unser 's flameout  --  crunch-o. // " I shifted into fourth and there was nothing , " said Gentleman Johnny . While Rutherford waited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I started counting the laps people were running , " said Rutherford , " but I gave that up after 10 or so . " The car did get back out , and Rutherford finished in 18th place , completing 168 laps . // By the three-quarter mark , Penske was beginning to permit himself a three-quarter smile . With his cars in train , a Bobby &amp; Rick Choo-Choo , and with no one else on the same lap , it began to appear  --  well  --  just possible . Penske has been competing at Indy for 10 years , bringing top sponsors into the sport and a standard of excellence unmatched in any form of motor racing , yet his only victory in the race came in 1972 , with the smooth hands of the late Mark Donohue at the wheel . For that reason alone , a victory would be sweet indeed . But with the added factor of Penske 's being one of the leaders of Championship Auto Racing Teams , the organization that is challenging USAC for control of Indy car racing , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear lurked three very real threats : Ongais , Foyt and Sneva . Then Larry Rice put his car into the wall and emerged unhurt simultaneously with the yellow flag . When the green came back on , Bobby 's lead over Mears had shrunk from nine to two seconds . A few laps later and the orange No. 14 of A. J. Foyt squeezed by Unser . But that merely got A.J. back on the same lap as the leaders . Foyt 's car had stalled while taking on fuel midway through the race and he had lost 49 seconds in the pits getting it restarted . // At this point , things really began to be tense for the Penske team . On Lap 183 Unser suddenly slowed drastically and went into the pits , only to quickly reappear . But his pace was visibly slower . What had happened to Unser was the same thing that had put Rutherford out of contention : his fourth gear , the high-speed running gear , had broken and was soon joined by his third gear . // Mears nipped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would allow Foyt to close up right behind him . And sure enough , Sneva clouted the wall in Turn 4 on Lap 190 . But it did Foyt no good . His comeback charge had been too much for his Cosworth engine and it had swallowed a valve . Now Foyt could be seen pointing to the rear of his car , indicating the trouble to his crew even as the field motored along at reduced speed behind the pace car . The green came on with four laps to go , and Mears nailed the race down . His average speed of just under 159 mph was four mph off the race record , but he did n't mind that a bit . // For more than a decade , Indy has been dominated by an aging band of overly familiar veterans : the Unsers , Foyt , Rutherford , sixth-place finisher Gordon John-cock and Mario Andretti , who was in Monaco in the process of defending his Grand Prix racing title . The average age of those former 500 winners is 42 . It 's a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competed in the Baja 1,000 , to the hallowed " yard of brick " at Speedway , Ind . But Mears has handled the transition smoothly . And so had his family . Before the race Sherry Mears , his aunt , had been selling T shirts with THE MEARS GANG printed on them for $5 ; after the race the price had gone up to $10. // Another new face , and a most puckish one at that , also emerged from Sunday 's melee . Rookie Howdy Holmes , 5 ' 4 " and 29 years old , came out of Formula Atlantic racing to finish seventh in his first Indy . As the man said , youth will be served . And after a month of unseemly wrangling , the Speedway was well served by youth .
