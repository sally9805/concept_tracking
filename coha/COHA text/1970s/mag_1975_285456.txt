GALILEO <P> Directed by JOSEPH LOSEY Screenplay by BARBARA BRAY and JOSEPH LOSEY <P> Galileo Galilei , you will recall , got himself into a great deal of trouble back in the early 17th century by daring to confirm the Copernican theory of the universe . The Italian astronomer-physicist also formulated certain principles of dynamics and refined a new invention called the **25;4513;TOOLONG that were considered acceptable , even exciting . But insisting that the earth revolved around the sun was pushing things too far , and the church got in a terrible tear . The idea that the earth was not the center of the universe held disturbing theological and philosophical implications , unacceptable to Rome . Galileo was urged , finally forced , to recant . He spent his last years in a villa outside Florence in an enforced isolation that was more like imprisonment . <P> Rueful Humor . There is something piquant and warmingly cynical in the spectacle of civilized man rejecting truth , and one of the best things about this production of Bertolt Brecht 's Galileo is that it is full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Accident , The Go-Between ) staged the American premiere of the play 27 years ago , and for this film adaptation he has pruned some of Brecht 's more arid ideological asides without substantially damaging the original text . Somewhat less comfortably , Losey flirts with Brecht 's best-known theatrical devices : he uses a chorus ( as well as the excellent original score of Hanns Eisler ) and stages the scene of Galileo 's anticipated recantation in stark relief - huge shadows against a white screen dwarfing the fore ground figures . He also begins the whole production with an overhead shot of the film sound stage . Since Brecht 's ideas were intended to breach and defy the proscenium rather than challenge the camera , this last device looks a little out of place . <P> Galileo is about both the unreason able fate of reason and the attempts to thwart and subvert truth . Knowledge and truth , for Brecht , would ultimately be nurtured and fueled by the proletariat , the working man being the true repository of hope . This seems a pretty romantic proposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolishing every article of romantic faith . But Brecht knew well , and portrayed with ruthless accuracy , the inbred conservatism of power , the stale air of the cloister that can smother the free , creative spirit . What makes Galileo impor tant , finally , is its ironic accounting of the price of compromise and even of freedom . <P> Strangely , Losey did not apply Copernican tenets to his casting . Galileo , who ought to be the radiant center of this dramatic universe , is so insubstantially summoned up by Topol that he is outshone and outdone by the secondary heavenly bodies . He seems to revolve around them . Topol , who last loped in Fiddler on the Roof , has a sort of toothy ingenuousness that gives Galileo an unfortunate puppy-dog quality . Topol misses the role 's strength , both in character and intellect . Most of the actors around him , however , are superb : John Gielgud , Margaret Leighton , Edward Fox , Patrick Magee , John McEnery.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
