It may seem odd , ironic and even unbelievable to anybody paying those pumped-up OPEC oil prices , but the Saudis feel they are the suckers of th world In their own sardonic way , they even joke about it . They say that they have piped out their black gold but the paper money they have accumulated in return for it has suffered from the decline of the dollar . They are worried about the shakiness of the international monetary system and of some Western banks in which they have put their money . <P> Whatever the merits of this mindset , it is deeply disturbing to experts on Arabia-and to none more than Minos Zombanakis , a Crete-born and Harvard-educated banker who straddles two worlds . For over 20 years , Zombanakis , 52 , has been advising Arabs and Iranians on how to deal with Western executives , and vice versa . He knows the Saudis about as well as any Westerner can . He ranges far from his elegant London offices , where he has been the international chief for a series of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Blyth Eastman Dillon-INA . He is one of those multinational deal makers who live in Concordes , four-star hotels and mahogany-walled counting houses . He always rides a crest in good times and bad , making money - much money-despite a few sour deals among all the bonanzas . <P> In a voice that sounds like retsina tastes , sharp and rich , Zombanakis argues that the U.S. must strengthen the dollar for many reasons , not least so Saudi Arabia and the other OPEC countries will continue to sell their oil for dollars To do that , he says , " Washington must realize that the dollar can no longer act as the sole reserve currency in the world . The dependence of the world on the dollar is not a blessing but a curse for America . " <P> The dollar is weak , he believes , because it is the only significant international trading currency and more than 75% of the official reserves of all non Communist countries are held in dollars . This unique dominance has enabled U S banks to lend out so many billions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their value has been tumbling . Nobody knows how Turkey Zaire , Peru and many other impecunious countries will ever pay back their loans to Citibank , Chase or the rest of the big U.S. lenders . The debtor countries , pleading poverty , could indefinitely defer repayment . Then the Federal Reserve Board would have to cover those bad debts , meaning that the U.S. taxpayer would finance the bailout . Says Zombanakis : " We have created a system in which almost the entire debt of the world rests on the Federal Reserve . " <P> To strengthen the dollar , Zombanakis continues , governments must devise a new system , a collective responsibility that would spread the risks of financing international debts . One way would be to set up a world central bank that would issue a new reserve currency to supplement the dollar . Perhaps a revised International Monetary Fund could fill that role , in Zombanakis ' view , and the IMF 's Special Drawing Rights could serve as the new money . The SDKS would be backed by deposits from the countries that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the U.S. All of them would have major voices in managing the world central bank .
