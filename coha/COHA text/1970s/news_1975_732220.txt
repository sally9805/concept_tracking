txt As the Great Washington Shake-up shakes down , Donald Rumsfeld appears to have an inside track as Gerald Ford 's running mate next year , while Henry Kissinger and William Simon emerge as the dominant policy figures at the Cabinet table . President Ford has narrowed his vice-presidential candidates down to two ? Donald Rumsfeld and George W. Bush ? and he has put them into prominent positions where either would be viewed as a logical choice for the No. 2 spot . This evaluation comes from a Washington source who has for years had access to Mr. Ford 's thinking on political issues . " George Bush was Ford 's original No. 2 choice , next to Rockefeller , " this source says . " ' Then came Rumsfeld , close to Bush . " This informant was involved in the " screening " of Nelson A. Rockefeller before Mr. Ford named him Vice-President . He checked with GOP leaders around the United States and found there would be no serious objection raised to such an appointment . However , a White House source , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two men the " first look " when he gets around to naming his running mate , sees Mr. Rumsfeld as more likely to get the nod than Mr. Bush . This source contends that Rumsfeld , not Bush , was the next man on President Ford 's list for the vice-presidential selection , after Rockefeller , and that Bush was thiEd . In 1972 , when Congressman Gerald Ford was part of an effort to displace former Vice-President Spiro T. Agnew on the national ticket , he let it be known that his first choice then was Rockefeller and his second choice Rumsfeld . Mr. Ford and Mr. Rumsfeld have come even closer together during the last year in their President-chief of staff relationship . Hence speculation that gives the new Secretary of Defense the inside track on the vicepresidency , with the new head of the CIA a close second . Sources here also say that Elliot L. Richardson has moved one step closer to " higher things " by accepting the Commerce Secretary slot . But they contend that Mr. Richardson is being groomed for secretary-of-state service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might alienate some of the very people that were most unhappy about Nelson Rockefeller  --  the conservatives . * Ford 's V-P choices // George Bush , as GOP national chairman , steered a careful course of loyalty to Richard Nixon , even though he was known to hold private misgivings about Mr. Nixon 's deportment in Watergate . He might be the preference for vice-president among the conservative-oriented Nixon loyalists ? over Mr. Rumsfeld who is viewed by many Republicans as a " moderate . " Where does Ronald Reagan fit into all this ? The implication in the opening up of the vice-presidential slot by Mr. Rockefeller 's announcement is that a Ford-Reagan ticket now is a possibility . Perhaps . But not too likely , as seen here . Mr. Reagan already has said he is not interested in being Mr. Ford 's running mate . And while he does n't say so ? and will not until the last minute ? the President 's own preferences lie elsewhere . The outcome of primary contests between Messrs . Ford and Reagan could cause both men to revise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
