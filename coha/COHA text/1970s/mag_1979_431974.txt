 | THE OLD CHIEF 'S DEATH became the source of a revelation to me . I attended the funeral on a day when mourners had gathered in the great one 's compound in eastern Nigeria to =scuss the chief 's long life . What happened remonstrated to me the view that many . Nigerians hold not only of themselves , but of the world . A masked figure appeared suddenly and , s it came toward me , I saw a smiling , benevolent face and bright , cheery clothes . Then it wheeled , and the opposite side , garbed in black , presented a hideous , fanged visage . As the figure turned one way , then the other , villagers fell back in silence , and an educated Nigerian said to me quietly .

Yet such rubrics of the past provide few answers to the questions that trouble modern Nigeria , the second largest exporter of crude oil to the United States .

Still , a spirit of gritty optimism prevails . p 416 States-educated Nigerian on a north-south train , he had a scheme that he hoped would enrich both himself and coastal Lagos , the nation 's capital .

" " I will create a system of water-buses , so that the people will not have to ride to work in their automobiles , " Anthony had told me . I accompanied Anthony in his search for the materials and permits necessary to begin his waterborne transportation system . At every turn the doors of opportunity seemed to close . A local carpenter could make a large boat , but the engine and other materials would probably have to be imported . That meant costly customs duties . A bank would not grant him a loan to finance the project , mostly because of a lack of confidence in inexperienced Nigerian entrepreneurs like Anthony , a bank officer told me candidly . Also , landing permits would be necessary for the boats to pick up passengers on the waterfront , the same officer explained , and bribes would probably be necessary to obtain them .

Suddenly the human tide ahead of us parted and flowed around a dirt-encrusted figure lying flat in the dust , one hand clutching an empty beer bottle . We passed by in silence before Anthony spoke . " Money , " he said suddenly . " When you do n't have it , it bothers you . When you get it , it worries you . " He had unwittingly summed up the story of his own young country . In less than a decade Nigeria has risen from a struggling Third World agricultural nation to an oil-rich power .

" Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , Venezuela ? all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , " I was told by Harry Cahill , economics counselor at the U. S. Embassy in Lagos . " But they have n't come so far so fast as Nigeria . " Less than twenty years ago the nation did not even control its own purse strings . For 46 years it had labored as a British colony and protectorate , with foreign companies so enmeshed in the nation 's economy that the bulk of profits from palm oil , peanuts . cacao , and cotton went outside the country . Beginning in 1958 , foreign oil companies Growing pains beset Nigeria 's drive toward economic and civic maturity . Regional enmities persist among the Hausa , Ibo , and Yoruba as the government strives to forge a democratic constitution . Federal spending fuels inflation as high as 40 percent a year .

Foreign customers pay a premium for crude oil that is very low in corrosive and pollutive sulfur and high in volatility. f Still , slums abound , and the average annual income stands at only $380 . But oil wealth has also produced the largest fiveyear development plan ever undertaken by an African country . The 32-billion-naira price tag ( one naira equals $1.70 ) will be financed entirely by the nation it is intended to benefit . Launched in 1975 , the plan aims to raise the standard of living and to lift the country to the ranks of developed nations . It is attempting to diversify industry into sectors other than oil , to initiate broader education programs , and to increase agricultural production so Nigeria can feed itself .  | " I wish to stress that although this country has great potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of state , Lt.

" With a population of some 72 million and oil production of under two million barrels a day , our resources from oil are not enough to satisfy the aspirations and general needs of our people . " The trappings of riches and the realities of power have nevertheless shown themselves . A multimillion-dollar National Theatre resembling a jeweled crown has sprung up across the lagoon from downtown Lagos . Its biggest use has been to house events of the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture ( FESTAL ) in 1977 ( pages 430-31 ) . Dramatists , dancers , artists , philosophers in a symposium on black thought , and visitors from over the world jammed Lagos for a month of days and nights spent celebrating and discussing black culture .

Now that they have it , it worries them . It worries many Nigerians for reasons other than fiscal soundness .

Throughout my visits I talked with Niges who are buoyed by the new opportunis and new prestige but irritated by the blems . They accept the frustrations of an evolving society , however , with remarkable souciance . I watched reactions one afternoon as a Lagos businessman complained that his contract for five thousand pairs of shoes had been rejected by a local firm in favor of a foreign contract .

" Bribery is against the law , " he told me over beers in a hotel lobby one day . " But sometimes it becomes necessary . " It happened after I arrived at Lagos 's domestic airport terminal for a flight to Ibadan . One after another , eager young men approached and guaranteed me a seat on the plane for five naira ( $8.50 ) . I said I had already purchased my ticket , and entered a line marked " To Ibadan .

As the large jet taxied away , I reentered his office and vented my frustration . He was running , I told him , the most inefficient and , in fact , the stupidest operation I had ever witnessed . He stared at me in silence . I felt queasy as we returned to a downtown hotel . By early afternoon I was quite sick and experiencing a numbness in the ends of my fingers ? a sensation that I knew could signal food poisoning .

Quite the opposite was true . He took me to his office , cleared a place for me to lie down on the floor , and brought a drink for my parched throat . He radioed for an ambulance to meet us in Kano and helped me board the aircraft , where I was placed across three seats .

" In the old days he could have had your head for that . " waves and smiles , having experienced welcome , suspicion , hostility , and friendship , within less than an hour . The question of national unity festers in the Nigerian subconscious . Its origins are rooted in colonialism . No country called Nigeria existed until the British subdued many cultures and defined the boundaries of a colony . In the north , Arab-like Hausa horsemen had carved out huge empires . In the southwest , artistic Yoruba had built powerful city-states of more than twenty thousand population .

In 1936 open-cut tin miners discovered pieces of pottery and fragments of sculpture near a village called Nok . A laborer was found using a stylized terra-cotta head in his garden as a scarecrow . In 1960 came the biggest find of all : a village site that included 13 furnaces for iron smelting . Dating of items from the site placed them as early as 500 B.C. The mysterious and surprisingly Nigeria Struggles With Boom Times sophisticated society was called the Nok culture , after the village of the first discoveries ( page 436 ) . " It was a well-established civilization that existed in the center of Nigeria , " I was told at the Jos Museum by J. F. Jemkur , who has helped excavate and catalog the items since 1974 .

" The origins , and the fate , of the Nok  | culture remain clouded in mystery , but its influence and technology doubtless spread to other areas within the present country 's boundaries . When the Portuguese arrived in 1472 ? the first Europeans on record to set foot on Nigeria 's southern coast ? they were astonished at the sophistication of art in the mighty city-states of Benin and Ife . Later the German ethnologist Leo Frobenius announced he had found the lost civilization of Atlantis , based on bronze heads he believed to be of classical Greek design . " It is important to our sense of pride as a nation , and our sense of pride as a people , to know that the inspiration for such art may have come from the center of our own country , " said Mr. Jemkur .

I visited one of the main export terminals at Badagri , a town some forty miles west of Lagos . Time and rot have destroyed the huts that once housed the unfortunates awaiting the long and often fatal voyage to the New World . but the irons remain . A caretaker led me to a trunk holding the grim artifacts . Under his hand , chains and handcuffs rose clanking from the box , ringing up a harsh dirge of dark history . There appeared an anklet with a spike attached for driving through the foot of persistent escapees . For the vocally defiant , there  | was an oval ring through which the lips were pulled and a small spike driven through them from the outside . It was called itenu in Yoruba , or " shut your mouth .

Hundreds of thousands of visitors arrived for FESTAC 's month-long , countrywide celebration of black dance , music , art , and thought .

In 1960 , with all Africa brimming with nationalistic fervor , the British granted Nigeria a bloodless independence . The blood came later . Threads of power pulled variously from the Hausa in the north , Yoruba in the southwest , and Ibo in the southeast . The first republic ended in 1966 , after two coups and massacres of thousands of Ibo . In 1967 the east seceded , calling itself the Republic of Biafra . North and west allied against it , and the thirtymonth civil war ended in Biafra 's defeat . But unity did not come . When nine years had passed without a return to civilian rule , another military coup displaced Maj. Gen. Yakubu Gowon as head of state and installed Murtala Muhammed . Like the messianic prophet whose name he carried , Muhammed seemed destined to lead his people back from the abyss of corruption and inefficiency .

A new constitution was drafted , providing for legislative , executive , and judicial systems patterned in part after those of the United States . Some Old Ways Survive Can the differences of the past be resolved in a new republic ? To find the answers , Bruno Barbey and I began a counterclockwise swing around the country in search of a sense of nationhood , where a nation did not even exist a century earlier . Everywhere we found evidence of a people in the throes of change . Modern highways looping past villages of conical mud huts . Trucks loaded with machinery roaring past a cattle drive that was like a scene out of America 's Old West . Modern plumbing fixtures that often yielded no water . And , always , phones that were little more than ornaments . Our first stop was Benin City , site of the last powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this century .

As we talked , a patriarch emerged from the mud-brick house , wearing a flowered cloth fastened at the waist . A mold for a new statue was half buried upright in the cool earth , and neighbors gathered to watch as the patriarch shouted instructions to young artisans . Molten bronze was poured into a hole at the top of the mold in a fiery orange stream , filling the contoured spaces left by beeswax that had been melted away earlier . I asked Johnbull about buying one of the castings , and he said quietly , " Of course . but we must discuss it later .

" Yes , they do , " he replied . " But they ca n't change the way they feel . " That quick step between past and present , between tradition and modernity , confronts the majority of Nigerians , confusing the machinery of society as well as the mind . " Our technical infrastructure is nonexistent , " I had been told in Lagos by Chief J. O. Udoji , whose Nigerian Tobacco Company has become a model of efficiency and local enterprise . " There are just not enough machinists , mechanics , plumbers . Many trade skills in Nigeria are in short supply . " With the influx of oil wealth , Nigeria has leapfrogged the usual steps to industrialization . Machines , communications , and luxuries have been imported without the backup skills to service them . " That is why I have moved back to the village level , " explained Professor Chike Onwuachi as we drove the potholed streets of Ibusa , about 250 miles east of Lagos . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" Backcountry Wants a Bigger Share In a nearby village , change and tradition zigzagged like butterflies when I stepped through the portal of His Highness Obi Ofulue II 's mud-walled compound . The traditional kings , or obis ( called obas in the west and emirs in the north ) , once ruled huge realms with absolute authority . Now Obi Ofulue reigns as reverential leader and adjudicator over some 40,000 subjects .

" We have no hospital , not even a clinic , in a kingdom of 40,000 people , " said one . A former army major stood rigidly and spoke in clipped syllables : " We have potentials here that have not been tapped ? timber , coal , lignite . There is too much emphasis on oil . " " We need electricity , good water , medical care , " said an old chief who wore a black derby with solemn dignity . " Culturally , we find ourselves betwixt and between , " added their obi .

" Sadness Quick-shifts to Joy I saw the capability used in a most therapeutic way a short time later at the funeral of the chief , where I beheld the two-sided mask .

Men , women , and children were gathered in several clusters , dancing , singing , drinking a local brew , telling stories about the dead man 's life . " The mourning took place earlier , " explained Prof. " Now they want his spirit to depart for the next world in joy , not in sadness . " The only somber note occurred in the hut containing the corpse ( pages 426-7 ) , where the eldest son knelt . " It is serious here because of the awesome responsibility that now rests on the son 's shoulders , " said Prof. We emerged from the hut to watch the dancing . Men and women responded to the beat of drums with movements that were plainly sensual ? a reaffirmation of life in the midst of death .

New Wealth Lures Farmers From Land Beyond Jos , the country grows increassingly drier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually baobabs , twisted of limb and bottom-heavy in the trunk , tike aging gnomes whose weight has gone to their legs . I watched a thirsty herd of humpbacked Fulani cattle using their straight long horns to tear up the soft soil of a dried wash to get the moist earth beneath , as their ? . oung herdsman raised his canteen overbead to drain a final drop . Lack of water , lack of services , lack of profit ? all are stumbling blocks to the resurgence of Nigerian agriculture . Oil wealth buys food from abroad , but it also has lured thousands of young Nigerians away from the farm . Much of the tillable land remains uncultivated . The development plan earmarked 2.2 billion naira for the agricultural sector before 1980 , and posters urge a return to the land and the dignity of farming . Yet a large proportion of the agriculturalists are subsistence farmers who have little left over for market beyond what they consume . Dignity is hard to sell to a man like Dongo , whom I met as I walked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows for a new yam planting when I hailed him . Down payment on the future , Nigeria 's free primary-education plan aims to put all youngsters , like these Ibo in Aba ( facing page ) , in school by 1980 . Students at Lagos University , one of 13 in the country , receive degrees ( below ) . Thousands of other Nigerians study abroad . His tool was a shovel with a J-shaped appendage halfway down the long handle . With feet far apart , he bent and swung the implement between his legs , capturing a shovelful of dirt and creating a neat trench for the new crop . I asked for a turn , and with my clumsy efforts soon left both my dignity and my sweat on the loamy soil . The few yams left over from a year of such labors , Dongo explained , may bring enough naira to buy some salt and palm oil for cooking .  | " People will not start moving back to the land until they see that it can be profitable , " I was told by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agriculture 's " Operation Feed the Nation . " Mr. Eze manages a staff of extension workers who assist farmers in the search for improved methods . At the government-funded Tiga dam and irrigation project southwest of Kano , a northern city of more than a million people , I visited farmers growing corn , millet , tomatoes , and wheat year round in the bone-dry sub-Sahara . When completed sometime within the next decade , the Tiga dam will irrigate about 120,000 acres . To a group of tomato farmers standing by an irrigation canal , I mentioned hearing of many Nigerians who had left their farms for city life . " If there were more projects like this , nobody would leave the land , " said one , and the others chorused their agreement . A New Breed Is Coming of Age Food from giant projects like Tiga . Oil from the Niger 's swampy outlets to the sea . I boarded the plane at Kano for a return to Lagos , wondering if Nigeria 's several parts could provide the glue to make a nation whole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems insurmountable . " You must remember that Nigeria is young , just as the United States once was young , " said Bayo Kuku , a Nigerian director of Mobil Oil . " You went through similar times . You fought a civil war , and so did we . Because of it you lost a President by assassination , and so did we . You had your time of acquisitiveness , your proliferation of business tycoons , and we are going through that now . It will level off . I am certain that a period of sunshine awaits us . " I glimpsed that sunshine in a Lagos schoolroom . The desks were old and the concrete floor was chipped and kicked into a fine dust , but Mrs. Obi Okonta 's socialstudies class hummed with excitement . The teacher asked if I had any questions for the 11-to-14-year-olds . " What product does Nigeria export most ? " I began . A girl with pigtails pointing in all directions rose and stood beside her desk . " Petroleum . " " Why does Nigeria sell petroleum ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can buy the machines and engines to run our country . " " What kind of country do you want Nigeria to become ? " A boy named Amadi stood up , his shoulders back , his chest out . His eyes , as he spoke , opened wide with excitement about every fourth word , exposing brilliant white against ebony skin . " I want Nigeria to become a country that makes the things we now have to import , " he said , eyes flashing now white , now dark , like neon signs of youthful optimism . One of the school 's administrators , Mr. Adedeji , nodded when I told him the story . " The young will be the redemption of Nigeria , " he said . " Our children want to learn . " Toward a More Thoughtful Future Office skyscrapers and government buildings elsewhere in the city had been airconditioned , but here Mr. Adedeji 's tie was loosened against the heat , and perspiration beaded his brow above the heavy hornrimmed glasses . Like most educators , he complained of insufficient money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " is that our clumsy system frustrates people who want to think . " His fist pounded on the desk . " We must be allowed to think for ourselves , " he said , voice mounting . " We must not be afraid to criticize . " He had once worked abroad , I pointed out . Why did he come back ? " To help my country , " he shouted , his passion now high . Was it his opinion that there were many others who felt the same way ? " Yes ! " he thundered , and his fist crashed again on the desk top , bouncing pencils into the air , striking a blow for hope in a nation struggling with success .
