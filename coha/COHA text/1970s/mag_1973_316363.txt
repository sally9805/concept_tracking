THE ICEMAN COMETH <P> Directed by JOHN FRANKENHEIMER <P> This is the first in a series of eight presentations of the American Film Theater ( TIME , Oct. 1 ) , an intricately organized system of production and distribution designed to give stage drama new permanence on movie screens . Current plans are to schedule each of the films for a brief run on different dates in different parts of the country . After that , the American Film Theater insists , they will be taken out of circulation , never to be released again . <P> Success has a way of changing plans like that , and The Iceman Cometh is a success indeed . It is not merely a worthy production of a great play ; it also possesses moments-most notably in the performance of Robert Ryan-of its own greatness . Altogether , it is a film of such extraordinary beauty and power that the A.F.T . would be doing both itself and the public a disservice if it quickly retired the film to a vault . <P> Like Arthur Penn and George Roy Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though he has made some good movies since ( such as The Manchurian Candidate ) , his staging of Iceman has the intensity and immediacy that characterized the best early TV drama . He also catches , rather better than Sidney Lumet did in his 1960 TV production for Play of the Week , the play 's roiling richness , the tidal flow from realistic melodrama into tragedy . <P> For such a long and daunting project , Iceman was made quickly : three weeks of rehearsal , eight weeks of shooting . Occasionally the rush shows , in a composition that is a little too static or in a microphone shadow against a wall . Overall , though , Frankenheimer 's production is careful and vigorous . Harry Hope 's bar looks dingy but never hokey . The photography keeps the backgrounds in as sharp perspective as possible , letting each viewer select his own point of focus . In that respect , this Iceman resembles the style of Orson Welles ' banquet scene in Citizen Kane , in which each face was vivid at a long table . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradoxically , never makes the eye feel cramped . <P> The storm center of the play is Hickey , the drummer , the shill for salvation through recognition of selfdelusion . He annihilates the pipedreams in which the patrons of Harry Hope 's back room curl up like quaking children in the middle of a nightmare . Everyone in Harry Hope 's place needs booze to nourish his dream , but it is the dream itself , not alcohol , that keeps them alive . Hickey , underneath his salesman 's brass and chatter , needs rage , contempt and anguish to galvanize the entire play . <P> Lee Marvin 's Hickey has the hype and the patter but only a portion of the necessary bravura . He seems to be wrestling with the vivid memory of Jason Robards in the same role , a performance of such passion that it became definitive . It may be unfair for an actor to carry such a burden , but Marvin does not carry it well . His Hickey is tentative , almost halting .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
