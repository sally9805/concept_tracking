THE BIG SLEEP Directed and Written by Michael Winner <P> What a botch The Big Sleep is ! First , it is an entirely unnecessary movie . Howard Hawks adapted Raymond Chandler 's classic detective story 30-odd years ago and he did it right : Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall played the leading roles and Chandler 's essential mood , at once cynical , gloomy and absurdist , remained intact . As that film is available on TV and in memory 's theater , there is no reason to try to duplicate it . There is absolutely no reason to rip Chandler 's immortal gumshoe , Philip Marlowe , from his natural milieu , Los Angeles in its corrupt years as an emerging metropolis , and relocate him uneasily in , of all places , London . <P> Doubtless this decision had something to do with the new film 's financing , which is British , but it is a disastrous one . There was an enthusiastic , obsessional air about the crookedness Marlowe used to encounter in L. A. The weirdos he kept turning up in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and everyone was feverishly intent on grabbing his share-getting in on the ground floor , as it were . Good , gray London has n't been like that since Will Shakespeare 's day-or anyway , Charles Dickens ' - and the correlation between landscape and Chandler 's characters simply does not exist . <P> And character is everything in Chandler 's work . The plot of The Big Sleep is impossibly convoluted , turning ever more tightly in on itself as blackmail schemes keep multiplying . It represents a deliberate attempt by the author to cancel out , perhaps even parody , conventional detective story suspense . The idea was to hold the reader 's interest with mood , dialogue and above all eccentric , not to say grotesque people . The fact that Writer-Director Winner has been more " faithful " to Chandler 's story line than Hawks and his writers ( among them , William Faulkner ) is no virtue at all . What matters is being faithful to Chandler 's singular vision , and that requires acts of cinematic imagination that are beyond the reach of the crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In earlier works Winner sometimes demonstrated a certain vulgar energy , but even that has congealed as he respectfully confronts this " classic , " and he seems to have communicated only that to his actors . As Marlowe , Robert Mitchum seems merely weary . Sarah Miles and Candy Clark , as the rich , spoiled and sexy sisters who inspire so much greed in others , as well as James Stewart , Oliver Reed , Richard Boone , John Mills , Joan Collins and Edward Fox , as assorted villains , victims and cops , all seem to be doing turns in a variety show rather than acting in an intelligently integrated drama . The result is a movie that lurches unsteadily from scene to scene . The Big Sleep is just an other snooze . <P> - R.S.
