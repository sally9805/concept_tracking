Despite their deceptive tranquillity , the English-speaking islands of the Caribbean have been stirring uneasily for at least two years in the face of rising black militancy . On most of the islands , even the prosperous tourist meccas , unemployment rates are distressingly high . The targets of black resentment are usually the well-off white minorities . Last week , on the two-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago ( pop . 1,100,000 ) , this resentment erupted into widespread violence . <P> Tension began rising sharply nine weeks ago , when ten Trinidadian students were fined $33,000 by a Canadian court for wrecking a $1,000,000 computer center at Montreal 's Sir George Williams University to protest discrimination against blacks . The episode caused great resentment on Trinidad . The islands ' black Prime Minister , Eric Williams , 58 , who led his nation to independence from Britain eight years ago , promptly paid the students ' fines , but his gesture failed to appease the militants . Threatened with strikes by sugar , bus and postal workers , Williams declared a state of emergency and arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nation 's 720-man army , nursing grievances of its own , staged a mutiny at its Teteron Bay headquarters , and rioting broke out in the capital . <P> Since the mutineers controlled the armory , the government sent out an emergency call for small arms to both the U.S. and Venezuela . The 2,800-man police force , the coast guard and about half of the army remained loyal. * Under its British-born commander , David Bloom , the coast guard blasted bridges and set off a landslide along the twelve-mile road between Teteron Bay and Port of Spain , thereby sealing off the mutineers from the capital . Loyal troops soon surrounded the Teteron Bay headquarters , but the rebels held some 30 soldiers and civilians as hostages . <P> Afro-Saxon Leaders . After three days of negotiations , the government agreed to sack an unpopular army commander , and the mutiny flickered out . Four persons were killed during the week ; of the army 's seven reported casualties , one had received a shot in the hand , another had sprained an ankle , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> There is little doubt that a tide of militancy is building up in other Caribbean countries as well . Many West Indians maintain that black power against black governments makes little sense . But militants dismiss their present leaders as " Afro-Saxons " and press for revolutionary change . In response , West Indian governments have resorted to a wide range of precautionary measures . The Jamaican government banned the works of Malcolm X. Bermuda canceled a schoolboy sports meet to avoid the danger of a racial incident , and Trinidad reportedly refused stopover privileges to one of her most illustrious native sons , Stokely Carmichael . This , as Carmichael modestly sees it , was the real reason for the uprising in Trinidad last week . <P> <P> * At week 's end , part of another Caribbean coast guard , that of Haiti , rebelled against the regime of President Francois ( " Papa Doc " ) Duvalier and shelled the National Palace .
