" It was offered , I refused . All desk work with high rank , which is not my sort of thing at all . Shall we go ? " " Right . " With many hands helping , the suiting went faster than usual . The hanging spaghetti loops of the umbilicals were taken from their lockers and pushed through into the flight cabin . " We 'll seal the hatch between this compartment and the flight cabin since you 'll still be pressurized , " Patrick said . " Would we be of any help if we suited up ? " Ely asked . " Negative , sorry . We 'll be crowded as it is . Nadya will be at the controls and will fill you in on the intercom . Here we go . " " Good luck , Patrick , " Coretta said . " And you too , Colonel . " On sudden impulse she pulled herself to Kuznekov , they were floating with their heads almost touching , and kissed him on the forehead . " Wonderful ! " the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finer salute . " But once in the flight cabin they were more serious . The hatchwas sealed and they put on their helmets , twisting and locking them into place . Nadya was connected to the air supply next to the pilot 's seat , Patrick and the Colonel 's umbilicals plugged to their suits and into the air attachments near the door . ' Are we ready ? " Patrick asked . " Oh-chin ogay . " He moved slowly in the clumsy suit , twisting the valve in the center of the exit door . It opened and the atmosphere in the cabin began hissing out into space . " Pressure dropped enough , " Nadya said . " Roger . Unsealing the door . " With most of the air gone the door could be opened safely without the pressure of the cabin atmosphere against it . It swung open silently . At this the atmospheric pressure dropped suddenly and the air became hazy with fog that vanished moments later as the last of the air puffed out into the vacuum of space . Framed inthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stars of the endless interstellar night . The Colonel floated head first through the opening . " There should be handholds all the way along , " Patrick said . " No problem , I feel I 've been doing this all my life . "  |p101The  Colonel was indeed a skilled space walker , his solid , clumsy-appearing form moving light as a feather . Patrick paid out the coils of the umbilicals as he floated aft , just touching the handholdswith his fingers so that he moved smoothly along . " Coming to the end , " Patrick said , looking at the short length remaining . " Just about a meter more . Let me have all the slack you have . That 's it . " The Colonel had clipped his safety line to the last rung of the handhold and was leaning far out . The umbilicals were now bar straight and taut , pressed hard against the lip of the hatch where they went out . Farther and farther the Colonel reached  --  until his linger seized the stern of Prometheus , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . " What do you see ? " Patrick asked . " Very little , black as Hades in there , in the shadow . Let me get my torch out . " He unclipped his flashlight and poked it over the end . The circle of illumination slid over the nose of the core body , the beam itself invisible in the vacuum of space , then moved out of sight . " Aha ! " " What is it ? " " Our culprit , all right . One of the connecting rods , a bit twisted but still holding . All the plungers around it are actuated and pushingto separate . The only problem being that the harder they push the stronger the connecting rod is wedged into its anchor to hold us together . But easily enough remedied , I think . " " How ?

What ? " " At the present moment I do n't see how we can reach the rod . It 's on the other side and the umbilicals wo n't stretch that far . "  |p102GET  03:19-COTTENHAM NEW TOWNSir Richard Lonsdale did not like lunches that went on so long , but he had no choice . It was late and they were still around the table in the executives ' restaurant , still wreathed in a fog of cigar smoke and the perfume of fine brandy . The Swiss seemed happy , coats open and perspiring freely . " My congratulations to your chef , Sir Richard , " Muller said , patting his great midriff affectionately like a pet dog . There was more light talk until eventually one of them looked at his watch . Chairs were pushed back and there was much handclaspingand many guttural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few hoped-for words . He was obviously a believer in good curtain lines . " We shall recommend the contract on the terms discussed , Sir Richard . I hope it will be only the beginning of a long and successfulrelationship . " " Thank you , thank you very much . " Their car would be waiting , and that would be that . He ground his cigar out in the ashtray and tried not to remember the trayload of papers in his office . They would have to be tackled now , like it or not , if he were to have any chance of getting home before midnight . The shortest way back to the executive offices was through the canteen and Sir Richard pushed his way through the swing door . He was preoccupied and would have gone straight through if the voices had n't caught his attention . There were a number of workers here , it was already late enough for the afternoon tea break , and a group of them seemed agitated about something . Not a wildcat strike , he prayed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time looking over one another 's shoulders . He recognized one of the men , one of the older employees who had come over from the original works.  | " Henry , what 's happening ? " Henry Lewis looked up and nodded , passing over his own paper . " Look at that , sir , enough to curl your hair it is . Just like the war all over again . " SATELLITE BOMB SCARE . Sir Richard scanned the piece quickly . " Like a flying bomb , " Henry said . " Hiroshima all over again . Look at this diagram on the next page , look where the bloody bull's-eye is . " A drawing of Great Britain with a dotted line bisecting it , the satellite 's track . To emphasize the peril the artist had drawn a great bull's-eye on the center of England and , completely by chance , the center of the bull was over Cottenham New Town .

" GET 03:25Colonel Kuznekov 's words echoed inside the helmets of the other two pressure suits , as well as from the wall-mounted speaker in the crew compartment . They answered with silence for no one could think of a thing to say . It was Nadya who spoke first , relaying , in a professional , emotionless voice , a message from Mission Control . " Major Winter , Mission Control wants you to come in . " " Tell them to go to hell . " " Hello Mission Control , this is Prometheus . Major Winter can not speak to you at this moment . Yes , that 's right , he 's helping Colonel Kuznekov in a survey of the damage . Roger , he will be with you as soon as he can . " " What did he want ? " Patrick asked  | " More radio contact , and could you rig one of the TV cameras so they could observe us for general broadcast . " " Negative . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kuznekov , stay where you are , I 'm coming out to see for myself . " " Right , Patrick . And bring the oxyacetylene torch with you and the tool pack . I think I know how to cut that bolt . " " Roger . Here I come . " Patrick clipped the tools and the torch behind him and drew himself through the open doorway , then snapped a clip on the handhold outside . After that , carefully , he pulled all of the floating loops of his umbilicals through the doorway until they hung free , writing slowly in space . Only then did he unclip and work his way back along the length of Prometheus , stopping every few feet to check the trailing umbilicals to be sure they were not getting tangled or caught . The bulky toolpack and torch on his back were weightless in free fall . When he had almost reached the end of the umbilicals Kuznekov reached back and seized his hand , pulling him the rest of the way . " There , " Kuznekov said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light appeared , gliding first across the smooth surface of the metal then over the nuclear motor and the angular forms of the pistons that should have pushed the two spaceships apart . The nearest ones were extended all the way , a gap showing between their ends and the base of Prometheus . But there , on the far side , was a jumble of twisted metal , half extended pistons and the intact form of a thick steel rod . Kuznekov kept the light on it . " Exploding bolt , " he said . " Unexploded . An American bolt I am unhappy to report . " " And those supports and pistons are Soviet , " Patrick said in a weary voice . " The interface between the two techniques , the weak spot where one system meets the other . Well , we were warned . Not that it makes much difference now . But  --  that bolt 's at least five meters away . We ca n't possibly reach it . " " Perhaps we can rig a pole and attach the torch to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , we 'd have to improvise . What would be strong enough ? And we would have to light the torch here and work it over there while it was burning . Rightp105between all that piping and the guts of the atomic engine . If that 's injured there goes the entire ball game . " " There it goes indeed , " the Colonel said , snapping open the latches on the tool pack . Inside , held in clips , were the tools specially designed to work in the cold and vacuum of space , to be operated by clumsy gloved hands . He drew out the torch . " The very thoughts you have outlined crossed my mind . The only way to cut that bolt is for someone to go over there and cut that bolt . " " We 'll have to unship one of the AMUs . " " No time for that , you said so yourself . So if you 'll aid me I 'll go over there and cut it . First the lighter , to be sure the torch is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Colonel Kuznekov , what are you talking about ? Your umbilicalwo n't reach over there . " " Obviously . So I breathe in a good deal of air , disconnect it , do the job and return . I can hold my breath three , maybe four minutes . It should be enough . If I black out I count upon you to reconnect my oxygen in time . " " Stop him ! " " He ca n't , no ... " The intercom roared with the cries of many voices . " Silence ! " Patrick shouted . " If you have anything to say speak up by turn . Nadya . " " I . . . nothing . You are the commander , you must decide . The bolt must be cut . " " Coretta , Ely ? Anyone else ? " It took a moment for anyone to speak , then Ely 's voice came over . " There 's nothing to say , I guess . Down here , we 're just passengers . But is n't there any other way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we must begin . There 's no time to waste . " " Agreed , " Patrick said . " The first problem 's going to be how to disconnect your suit from the umbilicals without your losing all your oxygen . If we just unplug it goes whoosh . " " I have concerned myself over that too and think I see an answer . " The Colonel opened the tool pack and reached in . All of the devices bore little resemblance to their Earthly counterpartsp106because of the unusual conditions of working in space . Small tools could not be held easily in the thick gloves , nor could fine adjustmentsbe made on them by hand . Nor , when tools were being used , could gravity be counted upon for help . We do not think of gravityuntil it is not there . On Earth it is a simple thing to put a wrench over the head of a bolt , to brace and push and turn it . Not so in space , in free fall . Without gravity to act as an anchor Newton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an equal and opposite reaction . If the bit of power drill goes in one direction , whoever is holding the drill rotates in the other . Thereforeall the tools for use in space were power-operated from builtinnicad batteries . Internal flywheels spun in one direction to provide torque for tools rotating in the opposite direction . Adjustmentswere made by moving a sizeable lever , actuating a motor to make the adjustment . Colonel Kuznekov took a wrench from the pack , very much unlike the crescent wrenches and open-end wrenches it replaced . The two adjustable jaws were motor driven and could be adjusted either to open or close , or to stop at an exact preset measurement on the scale . " What are you going to do with that ? " Patrick asked . " It will be obvious in a moment . The torch now , if you please . I think the tanks would be best clipped to my back where they will not be in the way . " The twin tanks were easily secured in place by Patrick , with the flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip of the burning head he held in his hand . A large trigger turned on the gas flow and when he touched the ignition button on top the nicad batteries produced a fat spark that ignited the oxygenacetylenemixture . A lever next to the button adjusted the mixture to a long needle of fire . " Step one , " Kuznekov said . " Now , Patrick , if you will just hold this burning torch for a moment , if you please , pointed well away . " The Colonel stopped speaking and began to inhale , slowly and deeply , filling his lungs with oxygen , hyperventilating , getting the maximum amount of oxygen into his bloodstream that was possible . Through his faceplate , Patrick could see him nod and smile when he had enough . With a swift motion he raised the powerp107wrench close to his chest and clamped it over the umbilicals , actuatingthe mechanism at the same time . With geared-down strength the jaws closed , tighter and tighter , clamping down on the electrical and intercom cables , squashing flat the flexible hose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely . " No air flow , " Kuznekov whispered , conserving his breath . " Torch . " He took the burning torch from Patrick 's hand . With a single pass he severed the umbilicals , leaving the stump with the attachedwrench dangling from his suit . Then he turned off the torch , waved his hand in farewell , and hauled himself over the bottom of Prometheus with a firm grip on a metal stanchion . " What is happening ? " The voice sounded in Patrick 's earphonesand he realized that the others could have no idea of what was going on . " Colonel Kuznekov is going to cut the bolt . He clamped the wrench on his oxygen hose so it would n't leak into space , then cut the umbilicals with the torch . " He was n't thinking clearly , Patrick realized . The severed umbilical was writhing in space like a garden hose . But instead of spouting water it was sending out a shower of frozen crystals . " Nadya , " he called out . " Turn off the Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being pumped into space . " " It is off , " she said , and the shining spray slowed and died . " What is happening now ? " " He 's halfway there . It 's slow going through that maze of hardwarewithout a safety line  --  watch out ! " Patrick shouted the last , forgetting that the Colonel was out of communication with his umbilicals severed . Kuznekov was fighting against time , taking chances that , as an experienced space walker , he would never normally consider . He must take them now . The last yards to the bolt were across a bare patch of metal . Up until now he had been moving steadily from handhold to handhold . Now he gauged the distance  --  and launched himself towards his objective , floating free in space . But he could not see what Patrick could . The bulk of the tanks on his back was in line with one of the extended jacks , aimingp108directly for it . Patrick could only watch , horrified , as Kuznekov drifted forward , his hand extended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and he cartwheeled in space , missing the bolt completely . The force of the impact swung his booted feet in the opposite direction , slamming them into the base of Prometheus . As they hit and rebounded the Colonel grasped at the bolt , but could not touch it . He was drifting now , out from between the booster rocket and the satellite station , heading towards the depths of space , with nothing near enough to grab on to . An inexperienced space walker would have kept on drifting , clutching vainly at the objects that passed just out of reach , but the Colonel knew better than this . He was already rotating slowly from the last impact . Bending over he drew his legs up to his chest in a single swift motion , increasing his speed of rotation . Just as a stone on string will spin faster when the string is shortened , so did he rotate faster . Then he straightened out to his full length , reached out  --  grabbed the angled brace of one of the jacks . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been watching the drama in space in silent horror . " It 's fine now . The Colonel has had difficulty reaching the bolt but he is almost to it . " " He will be running out of air ! " It was Gregor 's voice , thick with fear . " Not yet , " Patrick told him . " He 's not only hyperventilated but he has oxygen in his suit . He 'll make it . " The Colonel was making it . With a final swing he reached the bolt and examined it for a long moment . Only then did he swing out as far as he could and attach a clip from his belt to the base of Prometheus . Then , carefully and methodically , he ignited the torch , adjusted the flame to his liking , reached out and put the flame to the length of steel . " It 's working , he 's cutting it ! " Patrick shouted , so loudly that his voice echoed inside the confines of the helmet and rang in his ears . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it , drops of metal coming off  --  almost through  --  THERE ! "  |p109The  end was dramatic indeed . The pressure of all the jacks and hydraulic plungers was so great that , before the metal was cut through completely , the bolt snapped . Released at last the metal arms extended . In complete silence the two great metal shapes were pushed apart . Once started the motion continued , the core body drifting slowly away from Prometheus . " It did it , it worked ! " Patrick called out . " We have separation . And Kuznekov is all right , he 's unclipping and starting back . " Ile did not add that the Colonel was obviously in trouble . The minutes had ticked by , one by one , and his oxygen was finally exhausted . His movements were slow , clumsy . He pushed himself forward , grabbed the stub of the bolt and used this to accelerate himself towards Patrick . But his hand slipped as he fumbled his hold , drifting slowly . He shook his head , trying to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his last strength and consciousness he planted both feet on the bolt , waited until he was lined up  --  then pressed down firmly . Floating across the bottom of Prometheus , beside the bellshapedmouth of the atomic engine , straight towards Patrick . Limp now and barely conscious . But not straight enough . His hand was out , hanging slackly , his arm kept in position by the pressurized fabric of the suit . Patrick seized the lip of metal with his left hand , pushed hard , straightenedagainst the pull of the taut umbilicals , reaching out towards h uznekov 's hand drifting close . Close , moving , but not close enough . He gasped with effort as he fought the tug of the umbilical cables , stretching , fingers extendedas far as they could go . Silently drifting , Kuznekov 's hand went by scant inches from Patrick 's groping fingertips . In the full light of the sun Patrick could see the Colonel 's closed eyes , his lined face calm and at ease . The suited figure drifted by him , arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and oblivion.  |p110GET  05:32Flax was washing down his Maalox with black coffee and it was not doing him any good at all . His gut rumbled continually and sent out sudden gusts of flame like a volcano about to blow up . Not only that but the coffee was going right to his bladder and he forgot the last time he had been to the john so he felt as if he had a full basket ball down there . But he could n't leave the console now . " Listen , Patrick , we need this . " He was pleading and he knew it . " You were out of contact for almost forty minutes there , it was only the readouts from the bio-sensors that let us even know you were there at all . And when Kuznekov cut his umbilicals I 'll tell you things were hairy down here . And you have n't had the TV cameras broadcasting more than a total of fifteen minutes the entire flight . " " We have had some problems , Mission Control . " " I know that  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . But the situation here , without going into many details , demands your aid . We need that broadcast , Patrick  --  desperately . " " I read you , Flax , and I 'm getting agreement here . Before we repressurize the flight deck I 'll give you a shot out of the hatch . Stand by , Mission Control . " Flax sighed and leaned back , hooking his thumbs inside the front of his belt and pulling outward , relieving some of the pressure on his bladder . He took a sip of coffee . He could see the display below him on the TV monitor console , a breaking up signal and picture that quickly was put under control . He switched the picture to his own TV screen and switched his phone through to the network liaison console . " We have a picture , Bob , what 's your status ? " " All networks vamping and ready to take our broadcast . " " Tell them to stand by . Sixty seconds . " A light blinked on his board and he flipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earphone . " Mr. Flax , I have Mr. Dillwateron the line for you ... " " He 'll have to hold . " " But ... " " You heard me . I 'll get back to him as soon as this broadcast from Prometheus is over . I 'm sure he will understand that . " He switched off the voice before there could be any response , and nodded approval as the picture on his screen steadied and the hatch loomed large , then vanished and the Earth , as seen from space , appeared on the screen . " We 're receiving a perfect picture , Patrick . Just hold it there please . The networks are standing by , are you ready to go ? " " Roger . " " Give them the signal , " he ordered , and saw himself , small on the screen , from the network camera to the rear of Mission Control . " Switching over now to the camera on Prometheus . There , you can see it now , the Earth from the open hatch . Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over to you , Pro-metheus . " " That 's Earth as we see it , plenty of cloud . We are now ending our third orbit and , I do n't know if you can make it out through the cloud , but we are going over the Pacific with Peru just coming up , the air is clear there . I 'm going to move the camera ... just a moment . .. there , you can see the detached core body . It 's in orbit behind us at a bearing of about fifteen degrees . " Flax pressed one of the buttons on his console . " Kill the sound to the networks , but keep the picture . Tell them it 's a technical difficulty . " He switched back to Prometheus . " Hello , Prometheus . A good picture , great commentary , Patrick . What I 'm saying now is not going out to the networks . Do you see that spot of light just to the left of the booster ? " " Affirmative . " " Is it ... ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also following us in orbit . And before you ask  --  the answer is no . I 'm not going to zoom in on his corpse or anything like that . " " Just a report , that 's all I ask . "  | " You 've had that already . I 'm going to give you about one minute more of this then close the hatch and pressurize . We have work to do . " " Going live again , " he sighed and gave the signal . " The core body will gradually drop behind us in this orbit until it is brought back to Earth for a soft landing . In the cabin now , I 'll hand the camera to Major Kalinina while I close this hatch . Once we 're pressurized we can begin preparations for orbital firing . " The picture jumped around as the camera was passed over . Flax groaned to himself and wondered if his bladder really would burst . A light flickered on and he threw the switch . " Mr. Dillwater insists on talking with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's not waiting . He 's gone into Mission Control . " " Damn ! " Flax disconnected and turned his chair about . There he was all right , the dark figure just entering the upper tier . It had to be him , the only man in Texas in the summer who wore a dark suit  --  with a vest . Striding steadily , right up to the console . " Mr. Flax , your presence is required in the press conference chamber . " " Mr. Dillwater , I wish I could , but as I told you on the phone I ca n't leave this position now . The atomic engine ... " " Your assistant controler will take over . I have flown to Houston from Washington for this conference which I could have done just as well from there . The venue is here for your benefit . I realize your worth , Mr. Flax , and commend your attention to duty . But if you do not come with me now your assistant will take over and you will be relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NASA . Do I make myself clear ? " Flax , for the first time in his life , could think of nothing to say . The seconds ticked by dumbly and he realized that there was nothing he could really argue about . Realistically , he could take a break now as the flight cabin was repressurized and they removed their suits , he had the time . " Spendlove , take over , " he said , then took off his headset and threw it onto the console before him . " I 'll come with you , Mr. Dillwater . Only I have to go to the bathroom first . " He heaved himself erect and thought his bladder would explodep113now with the pressure on it . He tried not to waddle when he walked . The men 's room sign looked before him like the gates of heaven and he fell against it and pushed it open . Dillwater was waiting when he came out  --  were his eyebrows elevated ever so slightly ? Maybe they were , he must have set the world 's peeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dillwater . They went to the elevator . " Can you brief me ? " Flax asked . " It is simple enough . A New York paper broke a story a few hours ago , this morning New York time . Since then all of the media have picked it up , all over the world , and it 's snowballing . Have you heard about it ? " " Just a couple of words , someone told me who was watching TV . A crackpot idea about Prometheus turning into an atom bomb . Insane ! " " I am glad you feel that way , Mr. Flax , but please save your arguments and indignation for the press . As soon as he heard the first reports President Bandin sent me here to arrange a conference to destroy these rumors before they spread . I have just spent a very uncomfortable time in a supersonic Air Force plane , so you must excuse me if my temper is short . " " Who 's here ? What kind of coverage ? " " Everything and everyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I look upon you for aid in every way . " Flax was scared . He did not like big crowds nor did he enjoy being cross-examined by suspicious journalists . When backed into a corner he tended to squeak like a rat , which everyone enjoyed but which sapped his morale . He wished he could have a drink before he went on . There was the bar in the office behind the conference hall . But what would Dillwater think ? The hell with what he thought . " I 'm going into Jack 's office for a moment , " he said , turning the knob . Dillwater 's eyebrows arched up . " Whatever on earth for ? " " For a drink , if you must know . " The eyebrows slowly dropped and a suspicion of a smile touched the corners of the rigid mouth . " I will join you . "  |p114Dillwater  had a small dry sherry while Flax poured a half glass of whiskey , diluted it with water , then drank it straight down . " My God , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the thumb of his closed fist . " That is going to cure or kill me . " He belched cavernously and shuddered . Dillwater finished his last sip of sherry , tapped his lips with his handkerchief , and waved to the door . " Into the lion 's den , if you please , Mr. Flax . I 'm afraid we have no choice . " They came in by the side entrance and were unnoticed for a few seconds . Minford , the PR man , was behind the podium and fielding the questions . If his sweat-drenched face was any indication , he had not been having an easy time . Heads turned , one by one , as they crossed the front of the hall and the cameras began to click . Minford had the expression of a man just saved from the lion pit as they came forward . " Now if you would please hold those questions for a moment or two you will be able to ask the people who are completely in the picture . Mr. Simon Dillwater you all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a full report . With him is Dr. Flax who has been in the hot spot at Mission Control ever since takeoff , and has been in contact with the astronauts all of that time . Will you please address your questions to them .... " Hands , pencils and pads were being waved ; there were hoarse shouts for attention . Minford looked them over quickly , and pointed to the Science Editor of the LA Times . They had worked together for years and he might just be a little more sympathetic . " Dr. Flax , just what is the situation in space at this moment ? " Flax relaxed , ever so slightly , no trouble here . " Separation has been achieved as you know . At the present time the crew is repressurizingthe flight cabin so they can work in shirtsleeve environmentagain . The program now calls for the check-out of the nuclear engine in the lower compartment , the engine which will now be fired to lift Prometheus to its final orbit .... " Hands were waving again and Minford stabbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , the last booster still there in orbit ? If it fell could n't it cause immense destruction ? As much as an atomic bomb ? " They were silent now , waiting for his answer . Flax spoke slowly , counting off the major points on his fingers.  | " Firstly , nothing can fall ' from orbit , despite what you might have heard . This last booster , like the previous five , will be insertedinto a proper descent orbit and soft-landed just as the others were . Secondly , if anything were to go wrong , though this is unimaginable , the worst that would happen would be the destruction of the booster by combustion in the atmosphere .... " " If a malfunction is unimaginable , " a voice called out loudly , " what do you call the failure of the core body engines and the failure to separate ? " Flax was beginning to sweat heavily . " Perhaps I chose the wrong term . We can imagine an uncontrolled landing , in which case the booster would burn up . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Impossible . Thousands of rockets have been launched , all of t hem with disposable stages . All of these have burnt up on reentry and none have ever caused the slightest damage . " One man had been calling for attention since the interview had begun and Minford could ignore him no longer . " Mr. Redditch , " he said . The Newsweek correspondent was one of the senior men present , well known to all the reporters . They quieted , waiting for his questions , knowing he could speak for most of them . " I appreciate your arguments , Dr. Flax , " Redditch said . " But are n't you referring to far smaller boosters than this one ? " " Possibly . But the scale is n't that great . " " Is n't it ? " There was frank unbelief in Redditch 's voice . " This type of booster is bigger than any other , and Prometheus is many times bigger than the booster . Is that not correct ? " " Yes , but ... " " So forget the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself slammed back to the Earth ? Would n't it make one hell of a hole in the ground ? " " But Prometheus is not going to return to Earth . " Flax could feel the sweat trickling down inside his shirt . " It 's already in orbit and will soon be firing its engine and going into higher orbit . " " Is n't it in now what is called a decaying orbit ? Is it not true that if the engine does not fire soon that the entire satellite itself could plummet back to Earth after contact with the atmosphere ?  |p116Is  it not true that this decaying orbit will not last more than eighteen hours more ? " Flax did not know what to say . Where had he gotten those figures ? Someone had talked  --  they were NASA 's own figures . What the hell could be done ? Dillwater saved his bacon . Cool and calm as always he coughed into the microphone and nodded in Redditch 's direction . " There has been too much loose talk today , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen of the press are absolutely correct in your attitude , in your questions . You have heard these speculations and you wish to know about them . To determine the truth , if there is any truth , to lay to rest rootless and absurd speculations , dangerous speculation I might say , if that be the case . You are not gossip mongers , but representatives of a free press dedicated to telling the truth . . . . " " Well , could we have some ? " Redditch said , unimpressed . " My question still stands . If , at the end of the sixteen-hour period , Prometheus hits the atmosphere  --  what is going to happen ? " " Nothing . Because Prometheus is not going to do that . As we are talking here the fusion engine is being tested and will soon be building up thrust . There have been difficulties and they have been surmounted . We are on our way . " Oh , baby , you had better be right , Flax thought . You had better be very , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newsmen , to the back of the podium , where he knocked , ever so lightly , on wood . GET 05:39 " It looks like it belongs in a submarine , " Coretta said , looking down at the round hatch with a handwheel in its center that was set into the floor of the crew compartment . " It serves the same function , " Patrick said , turning hard on thep117wheel . Ely had anchored himself and was holding Patrick 's legs , giving him something he could thrust against . " Right now there 's just space on the other side of this hatch . The crew compartment and flight deck of Prometheus are a single unit designed to be ejected in an emergency . We sort of shoot out sideways propelled by rockets . Since we did n't eject we can now hook up with N'I'ECS , the Nuclear Tug Engine Control Station which is behind us . The engine room . I 'm pulling up a retracted tube now t hat will seal against the other side here . There ! Your turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealing nuts off . " It was not easy work . In a few minutes Ely was muttering with exasperation . " Why the devil does it have to be dogged down so hard ? " he said , wrestling the wrench to the next stud . " You know why , " Patrick said , carefully putting the removed nut with the others in the plastic bag hanging from his belt . " There 's hard vacuum out there . Any leak would evacuate the engine room and we 'd have to operate in suits . But if the pressure readouts are fine we can do it in shirtsleeves  --  which is much easier . " Ely fitted the jaws over the last nut and tripped the switch . The flywheel spun and the nut came free . But he did not kill the motor quickly enough as he lifted the wrench off , so the nut was propelled violently across the compartment to clang loudly into a locker door . The thin metal dented and rebounded , slinging the steel nut hack with a good deal of its energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she shouted with pain . " Ely , you stupid ... " Patrick broke off the shout and called to Coretta who was in the flight cabin above . " Coretta , down here at once ! " He shoved Ely aside rudely , in fact using the other man 's shoulder to launch himself across the compartment . Nadya was floating in a small circle , holding her wounded calf in both hands as the blood seeped through the fabric . Patrick reached her , pulled her down towards the couch . " It 's not much , " she said . " I was just surprised at the suddenness ... " " Let 's see it . " He clipped her to the couch and took the clasp knife from thep118pocket on his leg , then carefully slit the fabric of her suit . The wound was bleeding freely but did not look bad . Coretta floated next to him , the first-aid box ready in her hands . " Let me see that , " she said , pressing a sterile pad over the cut . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think a butterfly here will do . Will you hold the box please , Patrick . " She worked swiftly , professionally . Patrick turned and looked at the other two men , Ely shame-faced and hangdog , Gregor shocked at the suddenness of the accident . " Listen to me carefully , all of you , " Patrick said . " You have just seen an accident . It did n't amount to much  --  but it might have been fatal . We have already had one death on this mission . Colonel Kuznekov died to correct someone 's error , someone back on Earth . Malfunctions do not happen by chance in space . They are caused by human mistakes , things people have done wrong or do wrong . I want an end to it . We can not afford any more trouble , do you understand ? We have only one thing to do now , nothing else matters . We have to get that engine fired up . So you will all stay here , clipped to your bunks . It may be uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . And that includes you , Ely . " " But I ... " " Shut up . We have no time for explanations or recriminations or even any goddamn conversation . Shut up and stay that way . Every one of you . I 'm going to take off that hatch and stow it . I 'm going to go through the tube to the bottom end and remove the hatch there . When I 've done that I 'll plug in my intercom and call you . You 'll join me , Ely , and we 'll start the engine . The rest of you will stand by here in case you 're needed . " He was irritable and abrupt and knew he should be more politic . But he was too tired to make the effort , too singleminded about what he knew had to be done . Nadya was an experienced cosmonaut . Even while he had been speaking she had clipped Coretta to the couch beside her and was sitting quietly waiting for further instructions . Coretta was finishing bandaging the wound  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet he kept his mouth shut . Fine . Only Gregor was out of it , turning away sullenly . He was cargo , useless , in the way and with nothing to do . Well he wouldp119just have to stay that way until they were in orbit and he could get un with his job . Patrick lifted the hatch cover and stowed it in its clips against the bulkhead . Then , with the wrench clipped to his belt , he floated headfirst into the tunnel . It was little wider than his shoulders and claustrophobic . If he let himself give in he could feel the walls pressing against him , his breath growing shorter and shorter . He kicked away the sensation , knowing he felt this tension , this incipientclaustrophobia , only when he was very tired . Like now . How long had it been since he had slept ? He had lost track with the seemingly endless holds . A day or more at least . Best not to think about it . The hatch cover that he was drifting towards , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his outstretched fingers touched it , slowing his movement to a stop . He clipped to the nearest ring and swung up the wrench . He was working in his own shadow from the single bulb behind him . Another wonderful bit of applied technology , but he could see well enough to remove the nuts one by one . Slowly . Stop wrench . Nut into the bag . The next one . The hatch floated free and he turned its oval shape sideways so he could push it ahead of him into the engine compartment . When it was safely stowed in the clips he plugged in his intercom . " Ely , down here with me . " The nuclear physicist floated out of the tube and neatly checked himself on a handhold , swinging about . They were all getting more facile in free fall , after a few hours in space . Ely smiled , despite himself . " What a lovely machine . Look at that thing , seven million bucks worth of fission reactor powered by a small fortune in uranium dust . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the hydrogen tank and the 25-ton biological shield that would protect them from its radiation when it was operating . All that was seen inside NTECS was the complex control station with its many readouts . Ely pushed over to it , smiling happily , and strapped into the chair facing the console . " Now let 's fire this thing up and get it operational as soon as possible . " When he touched the proximity switch the controls came to life.  |p120He  ordered the computer to display the starting sequence on one screen while the main screen lit up with the many-colored schematicdiagram that showed the status of all the valves and control circuits . Ely ran through them all very quickly , then turned off the safety inhibit . One by one he went down the list . Propellent status showed the hydrogen tank full . Start-up system motors and valves ready , nozzle throttles closed , heat exchanger operational , pipes purged ... Patrick watched in silence until Ely went through the last displayof the neon-closed loop , then settled back , satisfied . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the check-list . All in the green , A-OK , oh-chio gay . Plug into Mission Control and tell them we are ready to fire when they are . " He looked at the GET readout on the wall . " 09:16 and they gave us about twenty-four hours in this orbit before things warmed up . Fourteen hours and forty-four minutes to go , which is not very much time . Tell them we 're in a hurry and have an orbit to catch . " GET 05:45Academician A. A. Tsander was an old man and well aware of it . He looked the picture of the frail octogenarian , with his wispy white beard and crown of floating hair . Never a large man , he had been bent by age so that he walked now with a perpetual stoop that forced him to bend his head back to look up at people . Yet he was neither as weak nor as frail as he appeared , as many had discoveredthrough the years . Reaching his now exalted rank in the Academy of Sciences had taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked talent for political infighting . He was liberally endowed with both , but he was eighty-three and knew it , so he husbanded his energy for the times it would be needed . He was asleep now , lying on his back on the leather couch in hisp121office , his long white fingers laced together on his chest . His breathing was so unnoticeable that he could have been a corpse . Yet , deeply asleep as he was , his eyes opened instantly when the doorknob turned silently and a beam of light came into the room . " What time is it ? " he asked . " Almost midnight , Academician . The American colonel is here , you asked that you ... " " Of course . I will be down . " Three hours ' sleep , more than enough preparation for what was sure to be a long night ahead . He poured some water into the basin from the jug , bathed his face and hands then dried them . Then he lighted a papirossi , one of the thin cigarettes he favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the package in his pocket and went out . The halls in the office floors were dark and quiet and he walked through them slowly , gathering strength . He had a feeling he would need it . Inside the Ground Command Control Center there was light and sound in direct contrast to the dark halls and tiny bulbs in the rest of the building . Here was the beating heart of Kapustin Yar , the central command to which all inputs fed , from which radiated all commands . Standing at the rear of the great room , Colonel O'Brian was very happy to be there . This entire area had been Top Secret for generations , mentioned only in CIA reports , and then in only general terms . GCCT in KY  --  the Soviets were as fond of alphabet names as the Americans were  --  the center of ICBM and satellite launches . Well the ICBM controls were gone now , where he did n't care , though the CIA probably knew . What was left were the satellite controls which were now being used to land the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet  --  American project , it was necessary to have liaison and at least one observer here . How the Soviets had wriggled and twisted over that one ! How responsibility had been passed higher and higher , until the CommunistParty Central Committee had finally inherited the buck , since it had nowhere else to go . Back , after a long time , had come a reluctant yes . Arriving , the very next day , was Colonel O'Brian who had been waiting for years for just this opportunity . It had been a bit of a letdown , most of the Soviety secrecy being just bad habit as always . There was n't anything done here thatp122was n't done in Houston . Only better . Yet it was interesting to see how they did it because it told him a lot about the operation of their ICBMs . O'Brian was not a cold warrior , but he was still in the Army and the more he learned the better it was for his side . He was the new kind of officer , with degrees in mathematics and physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the briefcase under his arm and looked around at the now familiar consoles and general bustle . Not the world 's most modern setup , but it worked , it worked very well indeed . " Are those the promised figures ? " a deep chesty voice asked in Russian . " They are indeed , sir , " O'Brian answered in the same language , completely fluent . He turned and saluted the massive form of Lieutenant-General V. F. Bykovsky , the man in charge of it all . Bykovsky returned the salute with an airy wave of his hand , lookingrelaxed and a little dull . O'Brian was not fooled in the slightest . The general was chairman of CEUS , an outgrowth of ICIC  --  Commission for Exploration and Utilization of Space of the Permanent Interdepartmental Commission on Interplanetary Communications . This made him top man of all Soviet space activities , responsible only to the Central Committee . A very big man indeed . O'Brian opened his case and took out a thick ream of paper . " All of the latest orbital data , observed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbits , " he said . " Very good , " General Bykovsky said , holding out his hand . " Not very good , but excellent , " Academician Tsander said , coming up behind them . " We will need them to refine our ownorbit . " He came only as high as the shoulders of the two big military officer  --  but height was not what counted here . Responsibility was . The booster landings were his responsibility . The papers were his . He glanced through them as he shuffled away , muttering to himself . " What do you plan to do with the core body booster ? " O'Brian asked , casually . Bykovsky 's lips smiled slightly at the question ; his narrow Tartar eyes did not . " Why land it of course , Colonel . Is n't that what we are here to do ? "  | " Absolutely , General . But you are surely aware that there have been some troubles with ignition . The more excitable sections of the world press are beginning to kick up a stink about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangling from his lips , white hair floating behind him . The file of papers under his arm far thicker now . " Gentlemen , we must talk , " he said . " Could we use your office , Valery Fyodorovich ? " " Of course , " Bykovsky said , pointing the way , knowing full well what the Academician had in mind . His office was wired and hugged and every word would be recorded for later study . There t mold be no secret arrangements , or later accusations of secret Arrangements of anything discussed there . It was no accident that ' l ' , , ander had reached his advanced age and high degree without coming to harm . " Be seated , gentlemen , vodka of course . " Tsander waved it away with his hand but O'Brian accepted with pleasure . He knew just how much of this white lightning he ould drink to keep sharp , and never had a drop more . It was Polish vodka , flavored with the buffalo grass , the kind he enjoyed . " Zdarorvya ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he instantly refilled . " What is the matter under discussion , Academician ? " " You know perfectly well what it is . Landing that last booster . What I want to know from you , now , is do we do it unilaterally or is Colonel O'Brian to be represented in the discussions ? " Bykovsky sighed inwardly as he downed another vodka , thinking of all the microphones in this room and all of the ears that would be listening to this conversation soon . It was a good thing that he had considered this possible contingency ever since the trouble had begun , and a number of phone calls had resulted finally in a decision from above . He was covered . " The answer is obvious , " he said . ( Hours of continuous phoning  --  obvious ! ) " Of course this is a joint project in every way . ' Ile orbital figures the Colonel has brought will be invaluable . But naturally he has no responsibility in the actual landing of the booster . Is that satisfactory ? " That way they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipping the next vodka and showing no expression at all . If the landing is faultless  --  then they did it alone . If there 's trouble the responsibility is shared and they can blame the US figures for the trouble if need be . The Soviet mind . It made Pentagon politics look like cat 's cradle . Finally , he nodded his head . " Then it is decided , " Tsander said with finality . " Here is our problem . Earlier attempts to obtain ignition on the core body were not successful . It appears that engine three is in difficulty and it has been isolated . Engine one has , we hope , also been isolated to obtain balanced thrust with the two remaining , opposed engines . Yet these would not fire at all . " " What about the attitude engines ? " O'Brian asked . " They have not been tested yet , nor will they be until decision has been reached as to how we are to proceed . A big concern is also the remaining fuel in the booster . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would be  --  how much ? " Bykovsky asked . O'Brian had been tapping quickly on his calculator . " About six hundred thousand kilos , " he said . " Hydrogen and oxygen . The most explosive chemical combination that can be used for fuel . " " I 'm aware of that , " Bykovsky said , tonelessly . " Please go on , Tsander . " " I said the fuel was a big concern , but not one that should worry us unduly . A good percentage will be used in the landing and my people assure me that the balance represents no threat . It will boil off harmlessly after landing . If we can fire the engines and bring the booster in under control . Please take note of that if . We must be prepared for the fact that we may not be able to fire the engines under precise control . " O'Brian nodded . " Yes , you may be asking a lot of a control system that has failed twice and now appears to be inoperative ? " O'Brian said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier difficulty and should have direct digital control of the firing now . You must realize that our only other choice is to do nothing so that in a few hours the orbit will terminate and the booster will be destroyed . " " Will it ? " O'Brian asked , quietly.  | " Ah , yes , Colonel , " Tsander said , blinking at him through dereptivelymild eyes . " You are of course referring to the press reports . Rubbish written by people with no knowledge of physics or orbits or science at all . This booster would be incapable of supporting its own weight if it were not pressurized . It is a tin can with the thinnest of walls  --  that now contains a good deal of high explosive as you pointed out . It would burn nicely in the atmosphere , quite spectacularly I assure you . But it is also a very expensivemachine and the heart of the Prometheus Program is our ability to reuse the boosters . Without this capacity we would never succeed . We would also like to examine the engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will not be repeated . " " All good reasons , " O'Brian said , nodding . " But I also bet you would not like to be responsible for blowing a great big hole in the landscape somewhere and maybe taking some citizens out at the same time . " Tsander finished lighting a fresh cigarette and nodded benevolently . " Spoken in your straightforward American way . Yes , that is the crux of the matter . Would n't you agree , General ? " " Of course , " Bykovsky said . He paced the floor like a caged hear , hands behind his back , thinking hard . " It comes down then to two possible courses of action . We do nothing and watch the booster burn up , with the very remote possibility that there might be an impact afterwards . Or we attempt ignition and bring it down under control . Is n't there a third possibility  --  that if we do have ignition we just send the thing into a higher orbit for future con-sideration ? " " Possible , but self-defeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , admit as well that we can not control our own machines and shoot them out into space when they give us trouble . " " Things that we do not want to admit , Academician . Therefore we really have only two choices . Do nothing and watch it burn . Do something and perhaps bring it back intact . Or , if we fail , watch it burn in any case . " " My thoughts exactly , General , " Tsander said . " Inaction destroysthe booster . Action may also destroy it  --  or it may be brought back for a soft landing which would be invaluable . "  | " Then the answer seems obvious , would n't you say so , Colonel ? " the General turned to face O'Brian , his head tilted slightly as though waiting expectantly for an answer . " I would be tempted to agree , " O'Brian said , slowly . " Either way the booster burns up , though one way may get it back . I can not advise you , since obviously I am just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your hands . " Tsander 's eyes opened wide as he considered O'Brian 's comments . " I love the unqualified qualification of your unqualified remarks , " he said dryly . " If you leave the military you have endless possibilities in politics , Colonel . " O'Brian made a slight bow and smiled . Then it was all seriousnessagain . " Time is running out , General , " Tsander said . " Do we have a decision I can act on ? " " It seems to me that the decision has been forced upon us . We must do what we can do to bring the booster down intact . Begin retrieval program . " There was little to be added . Tsander looked on while the others downed a last vodka , then they returned to the Ground Command Control Center . O'Brian had an office here , specially constructed for his liaison work . It was in one corner , glassed in , with readouts from most of the consoles that were grouped outside . He had a staff of six , all sergeants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all times . Discipline was very loose and Sergeant Silverstein just gave him a thumbs-up when he entered  --  and instantlytyped the fact of his presence into the teletype at which he sat . It chattered back in return . " They have been eagerly awaiting your presence , Colonel , " Silversteinsaid . " Washington and Houston want to know soonest status Soviet opinion re orbital soft landing capacity core body booster . " " You mean they want to know what 's going to happen to the damn thing ? " " That 's about the size of it . " " Report that attempt is now being made for complete soft landingretrieval through orbital accelerating and braking . Details follow . "  | " Roger . " The teletype hammered again while O'Brian plugged into the communication circuits . The computer outside was in direct contact with the smaller computer aboard the booster , asking questionsand getting answers . The attitude of the booster was most important ; which way the nose was pointing , up or down , at the stars or at the Earth was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body had turned and was no longer in the correct attitude for acceleration into a new orbit . The maneuvering rockets would have to be fired to adjust the attitude . This would be the first test of their ability to control the great rocket , hurtling along in orbit eighty-five miles above their heads . " Begin program , " Academician Tsander said calmly , when everything possible had been done . " Rolling . " It took some minutes for all of the data to be correlated and when it had been there was jubilation in the high chamber . " The Russkies seem happy , Colonel , " Silverstein said . " They 're halfway home , Sergeant , you can report that orbital maneuver appears to be successful . Booster in correct attitude for firing of main rockets . If they fire  --  and do n't send that last . " " Gotcha , sir . " This was the big burn and almost two hours passed before the program and responses appeared to be satisfactory . The faulty engine and its opposed engine should be shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fault that had prevented firing from Prometheus should have been corrected . It should fire correctly . There are an awful lot of shoulds here , O'Brian thought , and was very glad indeed that this was not his decision . He poured coffee from the thermos and watched the countdown clock as it was set in motion . Here it goes , he thought , here it goes . The count reached zero and the radio signal flashed out to the waiting receiver in the booster above . Unseen switches were thrown , the report of the monitors sent back instantly . " We have ignition ! " There was controlled jubilation . A big success , for they had started the engines when the Prometheus team could not . So muchp128for American engineering . These were Soviet boosters and they took well to Soviet control . Then a needle snapped over , then another . The computer readoutchattered and columns of figures appeared on the blank pages . " There is trouble . " " Firing has become erratic . " " Shut down ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Brian spun about and shouted to Silverstein . " Top priority . Ignition trouble on booster . Erratic firing . It appears to be out of control . More follows . " " Is this bad , sir ? " Silverstein asked , his fingers busy on the keys while he spoke . " It 's not very good , that 's for certain . Just how bad it is we 're going to find out very soon . " GET 07:20-COTTENHAM NEW TOWNWhat could she do , ohh , what could she do , Irene wondered despairingly . Yesterday evening Henry had settled himself at the kitchen table and written to the boarding house in Blackpool where they had stayed the last two summers . His holiday dates for the coming year had just been fixed and he was writing well in advance to reserve the same rooms again . He had given her the letter to post but it still sat on the mantelpiece resting against the china Blackpool Tower , fond memory of the city it was addressed to . But dare she post it ? Just this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had taken the last penny out of the Post Office account . The last  --  she could n't believe it . But it was all gone , every bit of it .

Henry would find out , he had to find out sooner or later , and what would she do then ?  |p129Seizing  her apron she pressed it to her face and sobbed , rocking hack and forth in quiet agony . What could she do , what could she do ? Judy and May did not know of their mother 's worries . If they had they might have cared , but not for long . Their lives contained far simpler problems : getting good enough marks in school withoutworking too hard , getting new clothes , new shoes , things that were directly related to their new , sudden overwhelming interest in boys  --  creatures considered as filthy pigs best avoided until a few short months ago . Henry Lewis 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his right arm raised , his left eye half-closed .

" He took a long swig from his pint of mild and said nothing , outwardly unmoved by the comments . He was n't shaken , just annoyed . Should have been in . But he would have another chance , Alf would n't be able to go out yet . The glass ran dry and he took it to the bar for a refill . George was polishing a glass and keeping an eye on the telly at the same time . Henry pushed the empty pint over to him . " Rooshins got trouble with that rocket , announcer said .

" " Nawt to do with us , nawt at all , " Henry said , putting the glass on the table and turning to do battle . For Giles Tanner the warm evening held no attractions . He had been up since four that morning and he was bone weary . Running the farm was tiring enough at any time , but this summer it wasp130exhausting . The days were too long , there was too much to do . Once the rains had stopped and the corn had dried he had to get it in . And his son down with the flu as well , he could n't blame him for that , though it could n't have come at a worse time . A whack of the stick brought the erring cow back to the path , behind the others towards the barn . Here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . He had to break off the reaping and do two men 's work , and even with the milking machines it was a labor . Then afterwards back to the field and the waiting tractor and the reaping . It was a bastard , it really was a bastard . The stick lashed out again , with no reason this time , and the cow jumped forward with a mournful moo . Giles looked up before he followed them into the barn . A quiet evening , the sky was clear , there did n't seem to be any rain in it . Thank God for that , at least he could get the corn in . The first star twinkled low on the western horizon . That late already . He grunted and went into the barn , closing the door behind him . Andrew saw the star and looked at his watch . Time to go . He did n't want to get to the plant early and wait outside the entrance , nor did he want to keep Sir Richard waiting . He drained the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very best . Then he wiped the decanter and put it away . The metal cup went into the glove compartment and , with a single turnover , the engine caught instantly . A wonderful beast , the Rolls . He engaged gear and rolled down the hill towards the plant . It was a dull life but a happy one . Sir Richard turned off the rec.uraer and threw the unanswered letters back into the basket . They could wait until tomorrow . He yawned and stretched , then pulled up his tie and buttoned his collar . Only after he had slipped his jacket on and had started towards the door did a little needle of doubt pierce him . Did he really have to take his briefcase home every night ? Reason tonight anyway . He had n't looked at the new estimates on their bulk chemicaland they came up at the eleven o'clock meeting tomorrow morning . He grabbed the bag , turned off the light and went to the frontp131entrance . The night watchman , bent over his desk at the night book , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlock the door , Sir Richard . Lovely evening , sir . " " The weather 's been good lately , has n't it ? Good-night . " The car was waiting and Andrew was holding the door open . It was indeed a lovely evening and he stopped a moment to savor it , looking up at the last sunset colors in the sky . The last booster was alone . Earth was far below , the men who had built it were distant  --  but the men who wished to control it still had contact . They had been talking to it for hours , their invisible messages picked up by the loops and lattices of the aerials . Fed into the solid state circuits of the computer , the unliving brain of this creature in space . This brain had communicated with the greater computer brain on Earth and had answered questions in exhaustive detail . And finally had received orders . The orders were simple and easy to obey . Small jets of compressed gas had puffed out from their nozzles on the metal flank , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moved and stopped it when the computers and their masters were satisfied . Now it awaited the final order . The signal that would begin the final operation . It came . A coded burst of radio waves . Picked up by the aerials , relayed through the communication circuits to the computer that issued its commands . Electric currents moved through wires and relays were thrown , switches clicked over , valves opened . Pumps whirled up to speed and hurled the hydrogen fuel through the orifices into the motors , where it met the oxygen that it needed to burn . Ignition . A spark  --  and the flame burst out in a tongue of fire hundreds of yards long . One engine stuttered , of the two that were firing . The flame went off , came on again , stopped a second time , clouds of unburnt particles gushing forth . The other motor roared on for some seconds before the first one started again , firing now with its fullthroatedflame to match its companion . Pushing evenly together to raise the acceleration , the speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be firing now . A short burn hadp132been programmed to start the core body in orbit downwards towards the empty Russian steppes where the engines could be fired one last time to slow it and bring it down for a soft landing . This was not going to happen . The continuous firing brought the rocket into the atmosphere , sooner , faster , the acceleration climbing until the engines stuttered and were silent , out of fuel . Within seconds the force of the atmosphere struck it and heated it , the molecules of air impacted by the metal rushing downwards at five miles a second . The fittings on its end , the jacks and arms , glowed red , then white , then were torn away in droplets of molten metal . The pressure was uneven and the great rocket wobbled , was buffeted by the thin atmosphere , began to turn . It had been designed that way , to be stable nose up upon it takeoff , stern down for landing . With ponderous ease it turned end for end so that the great plug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ablative material and intended to resist the heat of reentry . But not this speed , not this heat . It glowed , hotter and hotter , then began to break away in burning fragments . Short moments later the entire structure of the rocket began to disintegrate . Too late . It was going too fast . The incandescent mass of fire and metal punched a hole through the atmosphere , through the clouds . Towards the Earth , towards the growing , expanding landscape below . A last look at the evening sky for Sir Richard , a last breath of the evening air . The first stars on the horizon , a star above , almost directly above , a shooting star perhaps . Not a star , a light , a flame , one moment a point , then a disc , then an unbelievable flame-shedding spear pointed directly at him , dropping to impale him . For an instant his horrified face was bathed by the red glow , the grounds , the building , all illuminated as by the light of a terrible red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocket struck the Earth at five miles ap133accond and turned this frightful speed into energy , heat energy that exploded outward with the force of an atomic bomb . One moment the plant , the towering flats of Cottenham New Town , the Library Gardens , the shops , the pubs , were standing there . The next instant they were not . Buildings , bricks , bodies , trees , furniture , cars , everything was destroyed in a fraction of a second , vaporized in the heat , torn apart and wiped from existence . Half the town and all the factory went in the first explosion . The rest followed so closely behind that there was no time , no warning . Perhaps some were momentarilyaware of the incredible sound of impact and the light that followed ; perhaps a few knew that something impossible had happenedand had the beginning of a burst of fear that was destroyed before it could be formed . After the explosion came the shock wave . The air , compressed far beyond its capacity to absorb more energy passed on its tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that radiated in all directions . It passed through a flight of birds a mile away and , unmarked , they all fell dead from the sky . On the ground it was a rolling barrage of invisible guns that lifted up the ground , the trees and hedges , the plants and animals and buildings and obliterated them , pulverized them as it passed . It ran over the Tanner farm and mixed man , cow , milk , machine into a hideous jumble , exploded the house of Giles ' wife and son the same instant . The dart was never thrown , the game never finished , the holidayplans left unfulfilled . Irene would have to worry no more about her Post Office account . There would certainly be no Blackpool this year . There would be no life , no future , no existence for twenty thousandnine hundred and thirty-one men , women and children . Where this town and all its bustling life had been there was now only a seared wasteland , a desert of death in England 's green countryside , decently concealed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid the horror below.  |p134GET  07:52President Bandin was in the toilet , in his own private toilet when someone pounded on the door . He burst out seconds later , holding the towel , his hands still wet , fire in his eye . Bannerman was standing there , white faced , almost trembling . This in itself was enough to stop Bandin , who never in his life had expected to see that leathery skin drained of blood , the man suddenly as old as his years , older . The words came quickly . " My God , " was all that Bandin could say , in a hoarse whisper , not even knowing that he spoke , slumped against the open bathroom door with the forgotten towel clutched in his hand . " My God , oh my God .... " It took seconds , then minutes , then almost an hour to find out what happened in any detail . Colonel O'Brian , the silent witness at Ground Command Control , in Kapustin Yar , knew that something had gone completely wrong at the precise moment the controlersdid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . His fists tensed , tighter and tighter , as he saw the first erratic firing , then the continuous firing  --  then the change in orbit . The new orbit could not be measured quickly or easily and he was aware of the growing panic , the hysteria in the voices calling to each other and he was to verify this in many secret interrogations in the coming months . But right now all he could do was watch . As the figures flowed in the computer worked out an orbit . An unbelievable one . Slowly the voices died away and all sound ceased as the orbit was plotted on the screen . Changing , turning , downward , accelerating . With their mind 's eye they could see the danger growing unbelievably before them , watch enacted out minutes after the tragedy the last flight of the core booster ofp135Prometheus One . Watch until the utterly incomprehensible moment when the orbit , the path of the booster in space , ended . The computer , which had been printing out the rows of figures , rune to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chattering of the printer stopped at the same moment . The silence was absolute . " Send this ! " O'Brian ordered , and was surprised at the roughnessin his voice . Silverstein looked up at him , taken unaware , for he did not know one word of Russian and even less of space technology , and had not the slightest idea of what had gone wrong . " Top priority , and I mean top . For the President . Core booster malfunction . Appears to have impacted the Earth . Site unknown . " He scrabbled in the papers before him and made some quick calIllations . First estimate would be area fifty-two degrees north latitude , zero degrees longitude . " " Where is that , Colonel ? Where is it ? " The sergeant was beginning to have some realization of what was happening . " Zero longitude ? Greenwich , England ... " They Iooked at each other in mutually shared horror . They both knew England well . Knew how crowded with people that island was . Silverstein slowly tapped out the information that O'Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tragedy . When there was nothing more to report he typed a query for return information soonest on point of impact . The orbit analysis from Kapustin Yar was sent directly to the White House , followed by Houston 's own orbit from their tracking stations . Then Houston ran their own figures and the Russian ones through the computer once more and came up with an estimated point of impact , theoretically correct to within a quarter of a mile . Instead of bringing the raw data to the President the Information Officer in the White House made a xerox of the southern half of England and drew a red circle with a felt tip pen on the site . He then put the map and the final figures in a leather attache case and ran for the elevator . Because he was well known , plus the fact that rumors of what had happened were already circulating , the guards at the conference room door opened it as he approached . Almost the entire cabinet was there , hastily summoned , and every eye was on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thep136officer gave him the papers . Bandin looked at them in silence until the door had closed , then raised his head slowly . There was a faint tremor in his hands . " It looks from here , I ca n't really tell , as though the rocket came down in the countryside . There 's a lot of countryside in England . " His voice was hollow , his words unconvincing even to himself . General Bannerman reached for the map and he passed it over in silence . Forgetting that he had never worn them at a public meetingbefore , Bannerman took the gold-rimmed pince-nez reading glasses from his breast pocket and put them on . " Countryside , yes , " he said . " But the motorway cuts right through here . It 's heavily traveled , I know . And there is one name here , not easy to read in the xerox . Looks like Gottenham New Town . " " Cottenham New Town , " Dr. Schlochter said in his best scholasticvoice . Unlike the others the Secretary of State seemed outwardlyunmoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful British attempts to move light industry out of the cities into areas in need of development . You will remember that I was there at the dedication ceremonies with the Minister of Labor . " No one remembered or cared . The President turned to Charley Dragoni who sat at the secretarial table , a telephone pressed to his ear . " Well ? " he called out . " I have your office holding on calls to Whitehall and the Embassyin London , Mr. President . They know nothing more than we do , but will report as soon as they do . I 'm holding myself here on the scrambler line which has been patched through to Ten Downing Street . The Prime Minister is in conference , taking reports , but he knows you 're waiting for his call . I ... excuse me . Yes ? " He listened to the phone for a moment while they all waited in silence . " Yes , thank you , I 'll pass on the information . " He looked up . " The Prime Minister will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as he has finished a call to the Kremlin . " " Has anyone found out what sort of impact this thing would have ? " Dr. Schlochter asked . " Perhaps we are making mountains out of molehills . There are airplane accidents every day and they are forgotten the next . "  |p137Bannerman  had the figures scrawled on a piece of paper and his words filled the silence . " The estimate sent through from GCCT at KY is that approximatelytwenty percent of the fuel was unused at the last engine shutdown . That , with the total weight of the vehicle , gives ustotal impact mass weight of over a million pounds . Speed is important here . Going at sixty miles an hour that would make a hig hole in the ground and nothing more . Houston reckons that , rven allowing for reduced speed from atmosphere friction , that must have hit a velocity of over twenty thousand feet per second . Or if you want it on a speedometer , that is just about eighteen thousand miles an hour . About half the explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister , Mr. President , " Dragoni said . Bandin picked up the phone by his elbow . " Yes , I 'm holding . Yes . Mr. Prime Minister , President Bandin here . I am shocked , as I am sure you are , at this terrible accident . All of us here are hoping , praying , that there has been no loss of life , minimal loss of life . Yes , I 'm sorry . There has been what ? .. . Yes , I understand . Good God , this is terrible . I have no words , no , none .... Whatever aid , anything we can do .... Of course I do understand . Though of course we are not responsible for this terribletragedy we do feel responsible in that it is a joint project , although this rocket was Soviet , and we wish to do everything in our power in this hour of need . Yes , thank you , goodbye . " Bandin put the receiver gently down and looked around at the silent men . " That does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did hit that town , that Cottenham place you were talking about . Took it out just like it had been aimed at . No exact figures yet of course but the PM says the first estimates are at least twenty-one thousanddead .... " " Those are just the people who were in the place , " Bandin continued . " There are roads hit , the motorway , accident reports still coming in . Fires too . He 's called a national alert , mobilized troops , ambulances , fire departments , everything he can get . " " We could offer the assistance of our armed forces stationed there to aid in the relief work , " Schlochter said.  | " No , " Dillwater said with great firmness . " I would advise issuingorders for all American personnel to be restricted to their bases . The British have enough manpower to handle this themselves . Soviet rocket or no we 're in this up to our necks . I do n't think our people are going to be very popular over there for awhile . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree , Mr. President , I will issue an order to that effect right now . " " Yes , you 're probably right considering the circumstances . " Bannerman picked up his phone . " But what else can we do ? There must be something . " Bandin looked around at the men in his cabinetbut no answers were forthcoming . " What effect is this going to have upon the Prometheus Project ? " he asked . " It should not affect it in any way , " Dillwater answered . " We have backup boosters to replace the one destroyed . The project can go ahead . But there can be no question about not having a second disaster like this . " " I should hope not . Maybe we can ride out this one , but two strikes and we 're out . And I do n't have to tell you how much is riding on this project . National prestige , one in the eye for the Arabs  --  and the next election . If Prometheus goes down the drain , and the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , you are going to see one of them from that party sitting in this chair next year . I want to talk to Polyarni as soon as it can be arranged . And what is happening with Prometheus ? Have we forgottenall about them in this brouhaha ? " " No , Mr. President , " Dillwater said . " The engine is now being prepared for ignition and will soon be firing . You will be informed as soon as this happens . Final orbit will not be reached for at least forty-eight hours after that . Then the generator assembly will begin . " " It better . Set up a call to Polyarni . I want to find out what the Kremlin thinks about this . This is one time when we have got to stick together . "  |p139GET  12:06The nuclear engine countdown was almost finished when word of he disaster reached Prometheus , relayed from Mission Control . Flax had not mentioned the fate of the core booster until all of the facts were in , until the complete extent of the catastrophe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her what had happened in exact detail . She had called Patrick and Ely back from the nuclear engine control compartment so she could speak to them in person at the same time . When Major Gagarin , the first man ever to fly in space , had been in a plane crash his voice had been like hers . His engine had failed but he had stayed with his plane and flown it into the ground in order to miss the school and the houses below . His voice was calm and emotionless up until the instant of the crash . Nadya had been trained the same way . They did not want to believe it , they had to believe it , but it still seemed so impossible . " It could n't have happened , " Ely said . " It just could n't . " " It did , " Patrick said , his quiet words cutting through the shocked silence . " It happened . But there 's nothing we can do about it . It is just a fact we are going to have to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if anyone is to blame . It wo n't be easy but we are just going to have to put it out of our minds while we get on with the work here . Nadya , stay with the radio and give us reports of any developments . Ely and I are going to start the engine . " His eyes went to the GET readout and the others looked as well . " 12:42 . We 're running out of time . We 've less than twelve hours to build up speed and get out of this rotten orbit . If we do n't the same thing could happen to us . And we would make a far bigger hole when we hit . " In silence he pushed into the tube and back to the engine compartment , with Ely right behind him . " I 'll contact Mission Control , " Nadya said , shoving off fromp140the couch towards the opening to the flight cabin . Her eyes were red , from fatigue not from tears , and her motions were slow . " You should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your doctor . " " I know , thank you , but not right now . There is too much to do right now . It is checklist time for the air scrubbers to be examined . The fuel cells as well . " " Can I help ? " " No . This is a particular job that either I or Patrick must do . " Then she was gone . " It is always that way , " Gregor said . " Nothing for us to do  --  just wait . You are a physician , you have your work , but I am only a fifth wheel . I do nothing . " His face had sunk back into Slavic melancholy . " You get gloomy too quickly , " Coretta said , moving over to him . " This trip has not been one of joy unrelieved , admittedly , but it 's not that bad . Enjoy being a passenger while it lasts . When we get into orbit you 're the only person who counts , the one this whole trip is about . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure you do n't get sniffles . As I remember this thing is called the Prometheus Project and it 's supposed to put some kind of solar generator in orbit . And , with the Colonel gone , it looks to me like you 're the only one who can do that . " He wrung his large hands . " It will be difficult without Vladimir , " he said . " Gregor , you are just going to have to snap out of this . " She was totally professional now . Opening the medical cabinet she took out a small tube of pills . On her way back to the couch she grabbed up a squeeze bottle of water as well . " Take these , " she said , holding out two white capsules . " Wash them down with water , and I 'll give you two more in six hours . " " What are they ? " he asked , suspiciously . " The pharmaceutical industry 's answer to the rigors of the age of technology . Tranks . Tranquilizers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do not take medicines , thank you . They are not needed . " " Do n't be afraid of these pills , Gregor . They are to help , not hurt . " She saw the signs of strain around his eyes and lips . " I feelp141in the need of a little tension-relieving myself . " She put the pills in her mouth , showed them to him on her tongue , then swallowed them with a mouthful of water . And took two more from the vial . " Your turn now . No arguments . " This time he took them without protest and she sighed with relief . Ely , in the nuclear engine control station below , felt no relief at all . In fact , even in the controlled environment of the ship he was sweating . From tension , not from physical effort . The checkout was almost done , the preparations for starting up the nuclear engines almost finished . " Ready to go , " he said . " Begin , " Patrick said . " Is there anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're in the green so far . This engine is complex  --  buttheoretically simple . The uranium dust is trapped in a vortex of neon inside the light bulbs . The quartz tubes with this mix are surrounded by hydrogen , mixed with some tungsten so it wo n't be too transparent to the heat . Hydrogen moderates the U-235 plasma which heats up to twenty-three thousand degrees Kelvin which really warms up the rest of the hydrogen and sends it blasting out of the reaction chamber . So we move to the last step in the start-up , power to the turbopumps in the secondary hydrogenclosed loop .... " His voice cut off suddenly as a buzzer sounded and red lights appeared on the board before him . He threw switches quickly . " Is that normal ? " Patrick asked . " No , that is not normal , " he answered , lips peeled back from his teeth in a most unhumorous grin . " We have had shutdown . Somethingis wrong . " Their eyes moved to the GET clock at the same time . 13:03 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were due to run out of room in space and have first contact with the sea of atmospherewaiting below . " How wrong ? What do you mean ? " Patrick asked . " I do n't know yet . " Ely had programmed the computer to displayan eight-color diagram of the relevant circuits and controls and was tracking through it . " There are five engines out there , butp142they function as a single unit and are far more interconnected than the chemical engines . We 're having a malfunction in one of them . That 's what I am trying to track down now . Let me alone , will youPatrick , I have to do this alone . " " Right . I 'll be in the flight cabin . Plug into the intercom when you need me . " Patrick kicked off up into the lower compartment . He saw that Gregor was lying face down on his couch , really floating a few inches to it and held in place by the clips . Patrick started to speak but Coretta raised her finger to her lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the compartment went to join him . " Gregor is sleeping , " she said in a whisper . " I do n't want himdisturbed . Emotionally he 's in not very good condition . The fatigue and strain have been almost too much for him to handle . I gave him some sleeping pills , told him they were tranks . Had to take two myself to con him into it , but I managed to spit them out without swallowing them . " " How bad is he ? " Patrick asked , looking at the sleeping figure . " I ca n't say . Back home I would give you a guess , but this is different . He must have been stable enough or the Soviets would n't have him on this project . " " Do n't bet on that . The report I saw said that he was the only microwave transmission authority fit enough to go on this flight . I have a feeling he was drafted . " " If that 's true it would explain a lot . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution for this kind of work . But he 's going to be needed when we 're in orbit . With the Colonel dead , Gregor is now our only authority on getting the generator working . So if I can get him to sleep , to relax now , he should be functional when we need him . Once he 's doing that I do n't think there 'll be any problems . " " Thanks , Coretta . You 're right . Let me know if you need any help .... " " He does n't like to take pills . " " He can be ordered to . I 'll take care of that . " Patrick started for the flight cabin but Coretta caught his sleeve and pulled him back . " Just a minute . You 're under doctor 's orders too . "  | " Pills ? " he asked , looking grim . " Food  --  and drink . And bring some up for Nadya when you go . " Of course , thanks . Hunger and thirst strike like lightning as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal bags and squeeze bottles from the locker before he went to join Nadya . He strapped down next to her and passed over her ration . " Doctor 's orders . Chow time , " he said . " Thank you , I am thirsty . " " Eat too . " Patrick forced himself to finish most of the pulverized beef stew before calling Mission Control . " A little engine trouble , " he told Nadya as he sent out the call . " No ! Not more , it can not be . " She was horrified , her hands clasped against her breasts . " I 'm sorry , " he said , reaching out to take her hands in his . Her skin was cold . " I hope it 's something small . Ely is checking it out now .... " " Prometheus , Mission Control here . " Hello , Flax , Patrick here . I am reporting an apparent malfunctionwith the fission engines . Checklist fine , but barrage of red lights when we tried to fire it up . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tension were just as bad on the ground . " Do you know the extent of the malfunction , Prometheus ? " " Negative . Dr. Bron is on that now . Are the fission engine team standing by in case we need them ? " " Absolutely , all here . They want to know if you will transfer engine housekeeping data dump ? " " Roger . I 'll set it up . " All the steps Ely had followed in starting up the nuclear engine had been recorded by the ship 's computer . Patrick used his Commander'scontrols to retrieve the information . When he was satisfied he pressed the transmit button and all the details were radioed at high speed back to Mission Control on Earth . While he was doing this he was aware of the intercom bleeping and Nadya taking a call . She tapped his arm.  | " Yes , " he said , turning towards her . " It was Ely . He thinks he knows what has happened . I told him you were onto Mission Control so he 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his microphone again . " Mission Control , I have more information on the malfunction . Dr. Bron will report shortly . He appears to have located the source of the malfunction . " " You better believe I have , " Ely said , coming in . He saw the squeeze bottle of water in Nadya 's hand and realized suddenly how dry his mouth was , how thirsty he had become without knowingit . " Can I have a swig of that ? Thanks . " He drained half the bottle before sighing and passing it back . " It 's not good , Patrick , not good at all . I 'll check with the team in Mission Control and they can run it through their mockup , but I 'm pretty sure about what has happened . You know that the heart of these nuclear engines are heavy quartz tubes  --  which is why they are called light bulb reactors . That quartz is good stuff and the way the engine is set up the tubes are immune to thermal shock . But the pogoing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something .... " " Physical shock ? " " Exactly . Quartz is just a fancy kind of glass . Something must have bashed around back there during separation because I think one of the tubes is broken . " " But  --  can you replace it ? " Ely laughed , very bitterly . " Replace it ? Even if I had a spare it would be impossible in space . That tube is broken and it is going to stay broken . Those engines will just not run . " " Something can be done . Something must be done , " Patrick insisted . " Like what ? " " Like we take a look at the motors and see just what happened , send a complete report back to Mission Control and have them see what can be worked out . " " You 're an optimistic bastard , you know that , Patrick . " After the intensity of his work something seemed to have gone out of Ely . He was hunched , seemed smaller . " No , I 'm not . Just doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover a lot of what ifs . Now we 've got a problem here , but we need more data on it . You 're going to space walk and assess the damage . That 's what we need to know next . There 's only one undamaged umbilical left . Use it . Let 's suit up . " " Whoa , not so fast . I 've never space walked before , and I certainly had n't planned to do it alone for the first time . You have the experience and could save a lot of time .... " " I 'm not an atomic physicist . You are . You helped design the motor , as you 've often told us , so you should know what 's wrong just by looking at it . " He started towards the suit locker , then turned back as a sudden thought struck him . " You 're not afraid of going out there , are you ? " Ely smiled . " Yes , if you want to know , I 'm frightened shitless of being out there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires . I 'm frightened of this whole trip and everything about it . But I 'm here anyway because I would n't miss it for the world . So let 's get suited up before I change my mind . " Patrick was n't sure what to say . " I 'm sorry I said that . Please understand , it was n't personal . . . . " " It was personal as hell , my boy , but all is forgiven . This has n't been much of a pleasure cruise , has it ? And you 've been awake and working for what ? Two days now ? " He glanced up at the GET clock . " 1:3:57 and still counting . And the estimate was that we would run out of space at twenty-four hundred . Ten hours left . Why does n't someone ask Mission Control if they 've any revisions on that original estimate ? It would be nice to know . " " Nadya , as soon as we 're all suited up , talk to them about that . Tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to listen and record everything he says , then get to work on the information as soon as it comes in . Our time is running out . " There was not a second to be wasted now . As soon as the suits were sealed and the flight cabin evacuated , Patrick opened the hatch . His cabin walk-about umbilical stretched far enough to enable him to help Ely through and feed his umbilicals after him . " Slowly , " he said . " The one thing you ca n't do is rush now . " " Rush ! " Ely laughed . " It 's all I can do to move . " " There are rings all the way along . Clip onto one before you release a handhold. "  | " Right . Moving now . Faster than I thought , guess the experienceinside the ship in free fall helps . Here 's the base of the first motor , trumpet bell looks fine , I 'm moving to the next  --  Christ , there it is ! " " What ? " Flax 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read you well , Dr. Bron . What did you find ? " " The source of our trouble . I can see what happened now . The pogoing and that aborted separation we had with the core body booster . There was plenty of misaligned thrust then , knocking about . The shroud must have been shifted because it bashed into one of the motors . There are quartz fragments floating out of it and the thrust chamber is all askew and dented . I 'm close to it now . Motor four . The others look okay . Going up it now to look into the trumpet . I can see now . . . my God . . . it 's a mess . A real mess . Broken tubes , quartz everywhere ... must have a massive gas leakage . " Ely looked down at the ravaged interior of the engine , then pulled back slowly and stared at the great globe of the Earth that half filled the sky . It was infinitely more impressive when viewed from space rather than through the port . Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying something but he was not listening to their words . Flax 's voice broke off when Ely began talking . " That engine is not going to fire , ever again . Do you read that , Mission Control ? Unless you can come up with some way to bypassit so we can fire the other four engines we 've had it . End of mission . End of Prometheus . So get cracking . We need some advice . " GET 13:I2It was after two in the morning and Red Square in Moscow was deserted ; even the line of visitors waiting to enter Lenin 's tomb had vanished for a few hours . The two armed guardsp147stationed there looked on with little interest as a large black Moskva limousine turned into the square and accelerated towards the Kremlin . Cars of this kind arrived at all hours of the day and night for that destination . Perhaps a few more tonight than was usual , but of course there was no indication why . No public announcementof the destruction of Cottenham New Town had been made on the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America been in a hurry to carry glum news to the Russian people . Engineer Glushko led the way and easily penetrated the outer circle of functionaries and guards . Both he and Academician Moshkin who trailed after him had been here on a number of occasions . Their identification helped because anyone connected with the Prometheus Project certainly had business here tonight . Within these walls everyone knew what had happened . They also knew that Glushko was senior project engineer and the little professorwith him was also involved , somehow , with the project . Despite the fact that the two men had no reason to be in the Kremlin this morning , they progressed quite far before being brought up short . The inner circle of senior civil servants owed their seniority to intelligence , ability and suspicion , in almost equal parts . The graying man behind the desk , with ash on his lapels and the cigarette in his mouth trickling smoke into his halfshuteye , resembled all the other officials the two men had recently seen and bypassed . But this one would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hands as though looking for some fact he had missed the first time through . " Of course , tovarichi , I appreciate your positions on the PrometheusProject , it is all detailed here in your papers I assure you . But nowhere can I find the message or the reason that has brought you here today . " " As I told you , " Glushko said , " the Academician and I must see Comrade Polyarni at once . It is of the utmost importance . " " I am sure it is or you would not be here . Such a rush , a few hours ago in Baikonur , a military plane , a car waiting for you at the airport . A rush indeed  --  but nowhere do I see a reason for this rush . What business brings you here ? " " You know about the . . . affair with the booster rocket ? "  |p148The  official nodded gravely . " I do . A tragic accident . All of the country will mourn . Then you come in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly . Look , comrade , I do not like to be misunderstood . Do you think that either I or Academician Moshkin , one of the leading astronomers in the nation , do you think that either of us came here to play silly games ? " " No ! Of course not . But without stating your business it would be impossible for me to do anything to aid you . You realize my position , do n't you ? " Glushko sighed and straightened up . " I certainly do . But , as I told you earlier , what I have to say is for the ears of the Premier alone and for no others . Therefore I wish to see your immediate superior and explain the same thing to him . " " He is in conference , if you wait ... " " Eventually , we will see the Premier . He will want to hear what we have to say as soon as possible . Anyone who is responsible for delaying us will not be viewed with favor . Do you understand ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard this sort of talk , this kind of veiled threat in the past . If they meant what they said why then , yes , he would be in trouble . But if they were bluffing and he aided them he would only be in for a reprimand . It was a simple decision . He pushed his chair back and stood . " But I do understand . And I am sure you understand that I want to help you in any way I can . If you will stay here I will see how soon he can see you . " " Good , " Glushko said , voice firm and carriage erect . He remainedthat way until the door had closed , then dropped into the nearest chair . " This is exhausting , Academician , I hope you realize that . If you are not correct we are both going to be in very big trouble . " " That is not the kind of trouble to worry about at this time . This is the trouble , " he said , tapping his worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be checked . It is all here . " Glushko looked at his watch , then drummed his fingers on his leg . " In that case , " he said , " they had better hurry . "  |p149Halfway  around the world , in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , it was still early evening . Not quite dinner time , but late enough . All the offices in the East were closed , the labs shut , the college professorsgone home . Professor Weisman sat in his scruffy office watching the shadows grow longer , listening to the ring-ring of an unanswered phone in his ear . Not for the first time either . He carefully put the receiver back , steepled his fingers on the desk before him , and wondered what to do next . The few people he knew who might have been able to help him had not answered their phones . Or some moronic answering device had beeped at him and told him to record his message . He did not think there was time for that . He was still not sure how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor was he exactly sure whom he should pass it on to . Of course the people involved with the Prometheus Project would want to know , but he had gotten only busy signals from both numbers given him by the information operator . He rarely listened to the radio and had no television set , so he did not know of the news story that was just breaking about the disaster in England . He would have been interested to hear it , but it would not affect what he had to do . Washington , that was it , he would just have to go to Washington . Normally he hated to travel , but always said that getting out of the Fraunhoffer Institute and out of Germany and staying one step ahead of the Nazis all the way across Europe had been enough traveling for a lifetime . Life at the University of Pennsylvaniawas very easy , very calm , and he preferred it that way . But now his peace would have to be broken for a bit . He would have to go to Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheaf of notes into a briefcase as old and disreputable as the one Academician Moshkin was clutching on his knees in the Kremlin at this very moment . There were footsteps in the corridor outside and the rap of knuckles on the frosted glass of his office door . Weisman did not respond because he was concentrating so he did not hear the sounds . Only when the door swung open did he look up . A bearded face poked in . " Say , Sam , is n't that something ? Did you hear the broadcast about the town in England ? "  | " Ahh , Danny , come in , I want to ask you something . " " You did n't hear , then . One of the boosters from Prometheus took out an entire city , they do n't know how many dead , worse than an atom bomb attack . . . . " " Danny , do you know how to get to Washington , D.C. ? " Danny started to gape , then changed his mind . He had taught in the university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't really fruitcakes , just individualists with different powers of concentration and different interests . Sam Weisman had a world-wide reputation and a Nobel Prize . And he did n't care about blown-up cities nor did he know how to get to Washington , which was maybe all of a hundred miles away . Danny shrugged and forgot Cottenham New Town for the moment . " You can drive , you can take the bus , you can take the train . " " I can not stand motor vehicles . " Weisman frowned in thought , then took out an old-fashioned clasp purse and looked inside . " Four dollars , I do n't think that will be enough . " " Not really . What do you want to do in Washington ? " Weisman ignored the question , his mind involved in the logisticsof the journey . " The banks are closed . But you can cash a check for me , ca n't you Danny . Do you think five hundred dollars will be enough ? " " Five bills is more than enough but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked in his wallet . " You 're in luck , I just cashed my pay check . I 'll give you two hundred bucks , pay me when you get back . Your credit is good . " Weisman pulled on his jacket . " Is there more than one train station in Philadelphia ? " " Do n't worry , I 'll drop you off . You buy a ticket for D.C. and try and get on a Metroliner because the old rolling stock will give your hemorrhoids hemorrhoids inside five miles . " " Very kind . " He put on his hat . " Would you know if the Smithsonian Institute is hard to find ? I have a friend there . " " I am going to control myself and not ask you why you are going there in the middle of the night when it is closed . I 'm afraid you 'd tell me . Grab a hack at Union Station when you get in and tell him Smithsonian . Maybe the nightwatchman will know where your friend is . All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weisman sat calmly , his old briefcase on his lap , as they drove to the station . In Moscow Academician Moshkin was sitting in the same position holding a very similar briefcase . Yet this was n't the only thing they had in common . Each was an astronomer with a world-wide reputation . Each specialized in the study of the sun . GET 13:57 " Have a cigar , Cooper , " the Editor said . " You wo n't have smoked anything like this in years . A real Havana , claro , the first batch in after the trade treaty with Cuba . " " Excuse me , sir , I 'm sorry , I do n't smoke . " Cooper was too nervous to twitch or even think of nibbling his fingers . He rarely met the Editor of the paper , and certainly had never been in his office before . Here even the City Editor , that tower of strength and vituperation , was subdued and in the background . The Editor opened the liquor cabinet ; his fingernails were shining and pink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of the ink or dirt of the newspaper had rubbed off on him . He held up a cut-glass decanter and smiled showing two rows of perfect white teeth . " But you 'll have a drink of course , " he said . " Twenty-year-old bonded Canadian , I think you might like it . Water ? " Cooper just nodded at every question , still unsure of himself , not knowing why he was here . To be fired ? No , the underlings would take care of tasks like that . Then why ? He took a large sip of the drink and tried not to cough . His throat was on fire ; a cherry coke was the strongest thing he normally indulged in . " Good , is n't it ? I knew you would like it . " He glanced at the City Editor . " Time yet ? " he asked . " A few more minutes , sir . " " Well warm it up . " The City Editor waded through the carpetp152to the TV on its carved mahogany case and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , Cooper . I thought you ought to see it . " " Yes , fine idea , thank you , sir . " He got more of the drink down and blinked through his tears at the familiar face of Vance Cortwright on the screen . Cortwright wore his most somber expressionand when he spoke it was in deep , funereal tones . " There is neither Moon nor stars in the clouded skies of Britain tonight , as though the very heavens themselves have gone into mourning for the dead . This country has known many disasters in the past with plagues , the Great Fire in London , the trench deaths in the First World War and the bombings in the Second . These people know how to fight and how to survive  --  and how to die with dignity if they must . But never before have they experienced a disaster to match the one that happened here short hours ago . Reports are still coming in about isolated tragedies , but the central , unbelievable core of the holocaust that struck without warningfrom the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town used to stand . I say used to because there is no other way to describe this . " The scene changed as he continued to talk and little could be made of it at first , just moving lights and rolling clouds of some kind . It was only when the camera zoomed back from the closeup that a demolished structure of some kind could be distinguished . Spotlights were on it and firemen , wearing breathing apparatus , were working on it , tearing at it , in the midst of clouds of smoke and dust . " This was a prosperous farm on the outskirts of the town , a solid structure going back hundreds of years . It was destroyed in an instant by the blast , turned into this jumble of broken timber you see . There can be little hope that anyone could have survived this destruction but a search must still be made . No need to search the town itself . " As the camera moved , the site of Cottenham New Town came into view . Spotlights and Army searchlights illuminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing comprehensible could be seen . There was no connection at all between this vista of blackened , smoking rubble and the city of buildings , homes and peoplep153that had existed there . There were still fires ; the smoke clouds were lit from below as from an opening to hell . Even Cortwright 's modulated voice broke at the sight . " Perhaps all that might be said good about this ... this inconceivabledisaster is that they had no warning , no premonition , no pain . It was over in an instant . Full details are not in on the rocket booster that struck here , but it was obviously moving at many times the speed of sound . The V2 rockets of the Second World War , of which this booster was a descendant , moved faster than sound and the residents of London only knew of their arrival when the explosion occurred . The same is true here . One second this was a living city , the next a burning hell . Fire brigades and hundreds of policemen have converged on this site from all directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sealed off so that rescue workers can get through . Yet , tragically , there is very little to rescue . Except on the periphery , the outer edges of the shock wave that radiated out from the explosion . Here there are car accidents , ne multiple pileup involving over seventy vehicles on the motorway . Buildings have collapsed , mostly isolated farmhouses and homes , and people in the street have been struck down . We 'll have a report from the hospitals in a moment , but first this mess-age ... " The Editor switched the set off before the commercial came on . He was smiling , satisfied , like a cat after a large dish of cream . He raised his glass . " Here 's to you , Cooper , " he said . " You made this story , saw what was coming before anyone else did , and we broke it first and we 're now breaking circulation records . I have three reporters and live cameramen on the way there now in a chartered jet , and we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen before . And we 're not forgetting you , Cooper . There will be twenty dollars more in your pay envelope and a bonus as well .... " " Oh , thank you , sir ! Thank you so much . " " Not at all . Only fair . But you want to earn this raise , do n't you , Cooper ? Yes , I see you do . No , do n't bother about that , a little spill . The City Editor will wipe it up . I want you to think about bigger things . I want you to go out of here and write the follow-upp154story that will kick our circulation into a world-busting figure ! " " What follow-up , sir ? " Cooper gaped . " You 're kidding of course . The goddamn rest of the rocket , that 's what ! What will happen when it comes down , how much worse the disaster will be then . Put in everything , I want it all . " " B-but , there does n't seem to be any indication yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines ... " " Do n't believe a word of it . They did n't tell us their damn booster was going to blow up half of England so they 're not going to tell us what 's happening to the rest . I want figures and I want facts . I want the bulldog in the morning not just to have the entire story of the disaster that has happened but all about the one , the bigger one , that 's in the making . How many people on that rocket ? " " Six , five I mean , one is dead . " " The first victim . " He stabbed his finger at the City Editor . " Biographies on them all , personal stuff . The next in line to die  --  and who will die with them . You know what to do . " " I certainly do , sir . " " Then get on with it . I 'll be here all night . Let me have a proof of the front page as soon as it 's locked up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page , thirty column inches . Allow for it . " He finished his whiskey and slammed the glass down with a triumphal gesture . " TV and radio is the big thing , and they said the day of the newspaper was over . They 'll find out  --  and we 'll be showing them ! " GET 14:21It was almost seven-thirty in the evening in Washington . The government offices were empty as well as the streets , and all the workers were home with the air conditioning turned up full . Elec/tricity consumption was at its usual evening high as all the stoves cane on , and the television sets . They were all on this night , every TV , almost all tuned to the continuous coverage of the disaster in England . Only one channel , in the middle of an important series game , did not join in the coverage for fear the baseball fans would burn down the station as they had once before when a technical failure had blacked out the last , scoring , inning of a drawn game . But only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more action in England . In the White House the cabinet meeting still continued . Two and a half hours now and no sign of it ending . Bandin had talked briefly with the Soviet Premier but it had resolved nothing . Polyarniwas holding his cards very close to his chest and saying little . He and his advisers were still formulating policy , or rearranging the facts for presentation in the proper order , or looking for ways to make sure their American partners shared in the present Prometheusfailure . Until they decided just how to go about it they were being a little hard to talk to . The American cabinet was considering the same thing , only from the opposite direction . " We ca n't leave the Soviets with complete responsibility for this , " Simon Dill.water insisted . " Why not ? " Dr. Schlochter asked . " This is a political matter now , not a technical one , so the State Department has ultimate responsibility . They are our partners , yes , but this disaster is their responsibility and we must be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Statecraft , as the great Metternich said , is the art ...  --  " Balls to Metternich , " General Bannerman said , savagely biting the end of his cigar and spitting the piece onto the floor . " You drag out your Kraut and I 'll drag out mine , and I 'll give you a quote every time from Clausewitz that tops your guy . We are just going to forget the diplomacy and cold war bit this once and stay in the barrel with the Russkies . It 's our joint project . If we kick them in the ass now they take their marbles and go home . Prometheusis not going to get up there without their Lenin-5 boosters . Do you agree , Mr. President ? " General Bannerman was an old hand at this kind ofp156gamesmanship , which is why he was Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff instead of still riding herd on a combat division . Schlochter had had his mouth open ready to speak when he had passed the buck to Bandin , so now all Schlochter could do was shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of State ; he was so easy to needle . Would n't have lasted a day in the Army . " I have to agree , ' Bandin said . " No official releases from any department about this being a Soviet booster . This is a tragedy of the space age , it 's not the first sacrifice for the betterment of mankind , nothing but an unavoidable accident like being hit by a truck crossing the road . And we offer the British plenty of aid . And that includes plenty of money . They 're dead broke and they 'll appreciate it . " " Call from Mission Control in Houston , Mr. President , " CharleyDragoni said . " Put it on the speaker phone . " " You may go ahead , the President is on the line . " " This is Mission Control , Mr. President . There have been developments on Prometheus which I would like to report to you and Mr. Dillwater . The voice rattled from the loudspeaker on the table , clearly audible to everyone in the room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " It is the fission engine on Prometheus . The trouble has been localized . There has been shroud damage to the thrust chamber and engine four is unoperable . Possibility of restoring function is zero . " " What , what ? " Bandin said . " Dillwater  --  what 's that gobbledegook ? What the hell is he saying ? " " The shroud , that 's the metal covering over the nuclear engines that protects them during takeoff . It shifted , probably when the core body failed to separate , and damaged one of the engines . It is broken beyond repair and can not be fixed . " " Are you telling me that Prometheus is stuck up there too , and in trouble  --  like that piece of junk that took out the British town ? " " I do n't think the situation is that bad yet , sir . The four other engines appear to be undamaged . May I talk to Flax ? " Bandin nodded . " Hello , Mission Control . What is being done about bypassingthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " The computer is working on a program for that right now . We will inform you as soon as a solution has been found . " " Will it be possible ? In the time remaining ? " " It is the only chance . One moment please . . . " There was amutter of voices at the other end then Flax came back on the line . " We have a request from Prometheus . They wish to talk to you . " " I 'll have this call transferred to another phone . " " Put it through here , " Bandin said . " I did n't want to bother you , Mr. President .... " " Bother ! This is the only business on our agenda until that thing is up where it should be . Put them through , Flax . " " Yes , sir . " There were electronic sputterings and clicks while the patch was made from radio to telephone . This took a few moments , then Flax gave his okay . " Prometheus , you are through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . Over . " " Mr. Dillwater , Mr. President . Major Winter on Prometheus here . " " Go ahead , Patrick , " Dillwater said . " You know about our difficulties with the nuclear engines ? " " We do . " " Well we have been looking at the figures and we appear to have a problem . It seems that we are running out of time . " " What do you mean ? " " With the core body gone , the changed mass gives us **25;4231;TOOLONG hours before this orbit decays and we contact the atmosphere . There have been no changes in that estimate . Taking into consideration the amount of time to get the nuclear engine operational we may have a time overrun . We just may not he able to get thrust in time to lift out of this orbit . Do you under-stand ? ' " Yes , of course . " " Then I would like to respectfully ask what plans you have totake the crew off Prometheus before atmospheric impact ? " " Crew  --  why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well I hope you are considering it now . " There was an edge toPatrick 's voice that had not been there earlier.  | " Of course , yes . But you know that your relief space-shuttle is not due to take off until a month from now . It takes at least six days to get it on the pad . " " I know that . But I am thinking of the Soviets . Do they have a shuttle operational that might make orbital rendezvous ? Or maybe the Air Force ? They have been doing shuttle work with the fast turn around time . Do they have one operational right now ? " " I do not know . But General Bannerman is present and I will ask him . " He glanced over at Bannerman and raised his eyebrows . " Negative , " Bannerman said , his face expressionless . " There 'll be a shuttle coming on line in a few days . It can not be launched in the ten hours left . " " Did you hear that , Prometheus ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation with the Soviets . Please report soonest . " " We will do that , Prometheus . Just a moment , the President would like to speak with you . " " This is your President , Major Winter . I just wanted to say that our hearts are with you and your crew at all times . The utmost priority is being given to the safety and success of Prometheus , and of course your personal safety . Be assured that no task will be left undone , no stone unturned in our efforts to assure your safety and success . " " Thank you , Mr. President . Out . " " That kid is kind of snappy , " Grodzinski said . " He ought a watch his mouth . " " They are under a certain amount of tension up there , " Bannermansaid . " Still ... " " Shut up , Grodzinski , " Bandin said . " We 've a problem on our hands . We 've got to think of those people up there . We 've also got to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding around in . Dillwater , if they ca n't be helped , what happens in twenty-eight hours ? " " Prometheus will impact the atmosphere . " He took off his glasses and pinched the sore bridge of his nose while he spoke . " What happens after that , well we can not be sure . Something the size of Prometheus has never been in this situation before . Shep159might break up and burn , or she might hold together and impact the Earth 's surface . " " Are you telling me there could be a second crash ? Like the first one ? " " I am very unhappy to tell you , Mr. President , that it might be much worse than the first one . Not only does Prometheus weigh much more , but it still has its fuel for the fission engines . About five hundred pounds of radioactive uranium pellets . It is doubtful if these would explode on impact .... " " They would n't have to explode , " Bannerman said . " They would burn , melt , be diffused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to land in our back yard . " " Our back yard , anyone 's back yard . Depending where it was in orbit at the time it could strike most anywhere in a large section of the globe . " " I do n't understand that , " the President said . " It has to do with the rotation of the Earth , sir . Prometheus goes around the Earth once every eighty-eight minutes in a roughly oval orbit . But while it 's doing that the Earth is rotating , moving tinder the orbit . So with every circle of the Earth the satellite passes over different places on the surface below . At one point , unhappily , the orbit passed over Britain as we now know and regret . " Bandin had a sudden thought . " Has anyone bothered to work out where the orbit will be at the end of the twenty-eight hours when that thing is supposed to come down ? " " Yes , sir . It has been done . " Dillwater put a slip of paper on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the north Pacific at that time , cutting across the Gulf of Alaska at that time . " " That 's good , " Bandin said . " We 're not going to worry about icebergs and some polar bears . " " No , sir . But this orbit , the twenty-eighth orbit , continues south in a track along the entire west coast of this country . Going over in turn Seattle , Portland , San Francisco , Los Angeles and San Diego . " In a stunned silence the enormity of what he had said slowly sank in.  |p160GET  15:08 " This is a crew meeting , " Patrick said . " I want you all to know what 's been happening with the engines , with everything ... " He was surprised to find himself stumbling over his words . In his years of test piloting he had become used to long hours , even long days of work . Fatigue was something he had learned to control . But he had never been as tired as this before ; if he had not been floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch . Not that the others looked any better . If his eyes were as red as Nadya 's , he did not want to look into the mirror . Ely 's skin was pale with strain and fatigue , the dark marks under his eyes looked as though they had been brushed on with soot . Only the other two looked remotely human . Gregor , still looking dim after his drugged sleep , fought to keep his head erect . Coretta was calm and relaxed . If she was feeling any strain she was not showing it . And she was looking at him with deep concern . " You look like hell , Patrick , " she said . " And you know you 're having difficulty talking ? " " I sure do , doctor . Because I 'm plenty tired . " " I suppose you would n't try to get some sleep . " " You suppose correctly . " She kicked off to the wall and opened her medicine locker . " In any other circumstances I would not be doing this . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you want something ? You know you 'll only feel worse afterwards ? " " There may be no afterwards . Let me have a handful of them . " " What do you mean ? " Coretta was shocked at the sudden brutalitvof his words . He swallowed the pills and washed them down with water before he spoke . They were all listening now , rigid with attention ; even Gregor snapped out of his drugged haze.  | " Let us lay all the facts out , get them absolutely straight , " Patrick said . " We can not afford to kill ourselves by making any mistakes . The chances are slim as it is . Right now  --  " he looked up at the GET  --  " it is 15:II . We 're still in a low orbit that it is estimated will terminate at forty-three hundred hours , about halfwaythrough our twenty-eighth orbit . " " How can they be so sure ? " Coretta asked . " I mean we 'll be slowed by the air , wo n't we ? That will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , " Patrick told her . " We 're already being slowed now by the traces of the atmosphere at this altitude , slowed just enough to drop us lower and lower all the time . But you must remember that our orbit is not really circular , but more like a big ellipse in space . At apogee  --  that is our highest point in the orbit , when we are furthest from Earth  --  we are about a hundred kilometershigher than at perigee , the closest . On our twenty-eighth orbit when we hit perigee we will hit the atmosphere and that will he that . End of the voyage . " " The engines , " Gregor said abruptly . " You must start the engines . " The tension was back in his face again , his fists closed so tightly the knuckles were white . " We 'd like to , Gregor , believe me we would . But the four good ones ca n't be fired until we find some way to disconnect the broken one . Ely , you have any ideas about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a complex diagram he had been studying . " Mission Control is doing this in more detail , but I 've been trying for myself . The trouble is that the five engines are interconnected . They share a common supply of hydrogen , for both moderator and the fuel supply as well . Theoretically it 's possible to seal off engine four . It would mean a space walk and closing a lot of valves , cutting pipes and wires and isolating them , sealing them . But it 's dangerous . Cut the wrong pipe and that is the whole ballgame . Plus the fact that when you 're through with the spatial plumbing job and the engines get fired up , if they do , what kind of thrust do you get ? Can the off-center thrust be allowed for ? I do n't know , but I hope the boys in Houston do . Plus one final and vital factor . " Ely stared around at the circle of watching faces and could not look them in the eyes . He turned away abruptly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sinking ship . "  | " Not quite sunk yet , " Patrick said . " But the final difficulty is that even if we fire up the engines  --  will we have time enough to break out of this orbit before the twenty-eighth orbit ? The upper atmosphere is a strange area about which nothing can be predicted precisely at any given time . We might have time enough , we might not . But all we can do is try . " " Is that really all ? " Gregor asked , his voice too loud . " No . I 've already contacted Dillwater , and the President , about getting us off Prometheus before the twenty-eighth orbit if the worst comes to the worst . " " It can be done ? " Gregor asked , eagerly . " It 's a long shot , but a possibility . The space shuttle that was supposed to change crews in a month 's time is not ready . However there are US military shuttles and Soviet ones . All the possibilitiesare being looked into . So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us it can be done we try to isolate the knocked out engine . Then fire up . Then , with luck , get up into our correct orbit . In case it ca n't be done alternative plans are now being made to get us off . " " And if we do n't get off . . . ? " Coretta asked , her voice very low . " I just do n't know , " Patrick said . " If you mean do we get out of this alive , why then the answer is no , we do n't . This thing may burn up , or it may ride in in one lump . In either case we wo n't be walking away from it . " " But  --  could n't it be landed , somehow ? " " Negative . No chance at all . " " But , if Prometheus hits , could something horrible happen like with that English city ? " " The chances are against it , " Patrick said , as calmly as he could . " The odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , so Prometheus will probably impact the ocean . And about three-quarters of the land areas are mountain , jungle , desert , things like that . I doubt if there 's another disaster in the making .... " " You doubt it ! " Gregor shouted hoarsely , turning in the air as he tried to push himself erect . " The disaster is for us , is that not bad enough ? We are going to die and that is the end of it ! " " You 're going to have to keep your cool , Gregor . For your sakep163as well as for ours . . . . " The radio contact signal beeped and he turned towards the hatch . " I will take that , " Nadya said , and pushed by him and was at the hatch before he could respond . She was right , his place was here . " It is tough on all of us , Gregor , " Patrick said . " I know how you feel , shut in here with nothing to do . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indispensable man . Do n't forget that . All this effort is to get you up there , not us , into orbit with the generator . You are the guy who has to do the job . " Nadya came floating back into the group and they turned to her . " Mission Control says there is a good possibility that the faulty engine can be isolated and the other fired . It will have to be done from outside the ship . " " I knew it , " Ely said , and sighed . " Back to the salt mine . " " They think it will all work out well , " Nadya told them . " They 're sure that the eccentric thrust can be compensated for . And that there will be enough thrust to lift us out of this orbit . But firing must begin as soon as possible . " " You can bet your sweet bippy on that , " Ely said , warmly . " Mission Control has worked out a program of step-by-step procedures that are to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . They ask if two people can space walk at the same time . They know we have only one operational umbilical . " " The answer is yes , " Patrick said . " I 'm going to break out one of the Astronaut Maneuvering Units from the cargo hold . Ely , suit up and stay on the flight cabin umbilical until I get back . Then you can use the long umbilicals and I 'll fly the AMU . It 's going to work . " " It better , " Ely said . " Let 's get suited up . Coretta darling , let me have some of those pills before we tackle this last one . " " Of course . How about you , Nadya ? " She started to shake her head no , then stopped . " Normally , I do not like stimulants , but I feel this situation is very different . " " About as different as they come , dooshenka , " Ely said . " Join the junky brigade . " " You will seal the hatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more ? " " I 'm sorry , " Patrick said , hearing the fear in the man 's voice ,  |p164but  unable to help him any more . " This should be our last space walk . So let 's get it over with . " " I could wear my suit as well , " Gregor said . " I could help . " " He could do something , could n't he ? " Coretta asked , trying with her tones to tell Patrick how she felt . As a doctor she was well aware of Gregor 's borderline state . Patrick shook his head no . " Sorry . I do n't want to have to evacuate the entire ship  --  and there is just no room for anyone else in the flight cabin . And really no need for anyone . Nadya will relay instructions to Ely and me  --  and we 'll do the work . We 'll be as quick as we can . " Then they were suited up and out of the hatch . Coretta and Gregor looked up as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon after the red light came on beside it showing that the air was gone on the other side . Coretta turned around to find that Gregor was sitting , hunched over , his arms clasped before him and his head bent . Of course he could n't sit , but was floating a few feet above his couch . " Would you like something to eat , Gregor ? " she asked , but received no answer . " There are some nice things here . I must say you Russians do things with your space food that we would never consider . Look at this  --  caviar ! This little jar is easily twenty-five dollars on Earth , and here we are with a dozen or more . It 's worth going into space for this . " " Nothing is worth it . It is too terrible . " You did not need to be a doctor to hear the terror in his voice . " Well , it has n't really been exactly a pleasure trip so far . But do have some of this , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall never eat again , for life is at an end . " He was raising his voice to shout above the sound from the wall speaker , hooked into the radio circuit and repeating the instructionsfrom Mission Control about the spacewalk . She turned it off , it was too distracting and too much of a reminder of their plight . On impulse Coretta turned to the music bands , flipping through them until she found a pleasant piano concerto , Rachmaninoff it sounded like . In one of the cabinets a microrniniaturized tape player ran continuously , producing six channels of music that could be tapped at will . The clear piano notes and the warm sound of the strings filled the compartment.  | " It should not have ended like this , " Gregor said . " Too many mistakes have been made , too much was rushed . We were pushed into space too quickly , more care should have been taken . " " Ca n't cry over spilt milk , Gregor , " Coretta said . " This caviar is delicious . Too bad there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait it minute . I have some two-hundred proof surgical alcohol in there . Cut that in half with water and you have one-hundred proof vodka . How about that , tovarich , does a shot of vodka sound interesting ? " " There were mistakes , and they rushed too fast and we are going to die . " Gregor was pounding his fists together . He had not heard her . He needed something a lot stronger than the vodka . Coretta looked into the medicine cabinet , then back at the distraught Russian . There seemed to be no effect left of the sleeping pills she had given him , which should have been strong enough to put him under for hours . Could she get him to take any more ? Unlikely , he seemed unaware of her , uncaring.He had deteriorated very rapidly . She opened a metal box and removed the pressure hypodermic , then rooted out a plastic bottle of noctex . Enough of this would put an elephant to sleep . And the advantage of the pressure hypo was that you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just press the device against the body anywhere and a blast of high pressure air sent the droplets of chemical right through the skin . She would have to put the big Russian under whether he liked it or not . A good shot to keep him down until the danger was past . Or all over  --  but she was n't going to think about that . He was a patient and she had to do her best for him . Very quietly she closed the locker and held the silver bulk of the hypodermic behind her kg . Then pushed off towards Gregor . He had his back turned , his head lowered , was unaware of her . The back of his neck with the curly blond hairs was the right spot . Just place and press . She floated close , raising the hypodermic . " It is a crime what they are doing to us ! " Gregor shouted , straightening , his legs banging against the couch  --  just as Coretta pushed the hypodermic at him . The nozzle slammed into his shoulder , jarring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " What is this ? " he roared , seeing the apparatus extended like a gun towards his head . " You are trying to kill me ! You can not do that ! " He lashed out with his hand , slapping the hypodermic from her grasp , sending it hurtling across the compartment to crash into the wall , the force of his blow sending them both tumbling and turning . They collided and he struck again  --  this time at Coretta . " You want to kill me ! " The slap was clumsy , the reaction of his movement spinning him about even as he struck . A fist fight would be impossible in free fall . But the flat of his palm struck her forehead and his wedding ring gashed her skin ; small droplets of blood formed in the wound . The sight of the blood angered him even more and he lashed out again , but with little effect . His eyes were blank , his temper overwhelming . He clutched madly at the fabric of Coretta 's jumpsuit to pull her closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted away from . " Gregor , stop it , " she shouted . " Stop it , please ! " They drifted and spun , bouncing from the couches , drifting towards the wall , their insane ballet in space accompanied by the soaring music of the concerto . Gregor was panting now with the effort , still wild with fear and anger . To avoid his blows Coretta pulled him close to her , put her arms around his body and buried her head in his chest so he could not strike her face . His anger spluttered out . He sobbed deeply and placed his hands over his eyes . " My God , what am I doing .... I did not know .... There is blood on your face . I did that . " " It 's not important , it 's all over now . " " No , I 'm so sorry . Very sorry . I ask you to forgive me . I have hurt you , I have broken bones . " " No , nothing , really . " Gregor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down herarms , holding them , as though expecting to find the bones broken there . Pulling her to him , wrapping her in his arms . His breath loud in her ears , coming faster now . She reached to disentangle his arms . " I 'm sorry , " he said softly , " . . . sorry . "  | " Do n't be , " she said , equally as quiet , aware that his hands were on her back , moving lower , pressing his body tight to hers . The passion of his anger turning suddenly to another kind of passion . Coretta knew it had gone far enough and knew how to stop it . Yet , even as she thought of that she wondered why she should stop it . She was a woman , and had been married . She found that this big , gloomy , passionate Russian attracted her . And  --  she fought hard not to laugh at the thought  --  turning the laughter into a smile instead  --  by God , this was a first in space ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips and touched it with his fingertips , whispering soft Russian terms of endearment as he did . A single , long zipper closed the jumpsuit she wore and he slid it open slowly , revealing the brown warmth of her bare skin inside . She wore no bra  --  what need without gravity ?  --  and her breasts were full and round . He bent his face , burying it in their warmth , kissing her over and over . She held his head tightly against her . Helped him to open the long zipper , all the way . She slipped out of her suit and helped him from his : It was good , strangely good , floating weightless in space as though deep in the ocean . The waves of the music broke over them ... and broke again .. . GET 16:41 " Baloney , salami or rat cheese , Mr. Flax , that 's the lot . And you can have them on white or white . " Flax glared at the tray of unappetizing looking sandwiches . " Why is it , Charley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission starts the commissary runs out of everything edible and starts sending us up this kind of drek ? I suppose the bread 's stale too ? " " You got it right , Mr. Flax . But , after all it 's after seven at night , you ca n't expect .. "  | " I ca n't what ? I ca n't expect decent food because it is after union hours or something ? I got men here been working twenty-f our hours without a break and the best you can come up with is horse-cock sandwiches ? " " Not me , I just bring ' em . You want one ? " " Can beggars be choosers . " Flax grumbled , anger dissipated as fast as it had come , and he shifted his weight in the chair to ease his numb legs . He ought to walk around . After he ate something . " Give me one of each . Thanks . " He threw away one slice of bread from each sandwich , and mashed the remainder together into a triple decker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big mouthful and listened to the instructions from the fission engine team in his earphones. " ... that 's the one , painted yellow , to the right of the mounting . You 're going to have to cut out a section of the pipe and crimpsealthe lower end . Right ... " All of the time he was talking , eating , he was aware of that voice and of the two men in the vacuum of space trying to repair the atomic engines . Working always against the clock . At the thought his eyes went up to the GET readout. 16:43 . It flipped over to 44 as he watched . Time was running out . A light blinked and he threw a switch . " Russian desk here , Flax . I 've been on the KY and Baikonur and they swear they have nothing operational that could rendezvous with Prometheus before the deadline . They have a Soyuz coming on line in about two days but they have no way of cutting this time by more than a few hours . This matches the info in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the CIA intelligence . I got through to them without asking you , I know I should ... " " No , not this time . You were right , thanks . Then we 're sure there 's no chance of getting a Soviet rocket to rendezvous in time ? " " Absolutely . Sorry . A real zero . " " Thanks anyway . " He threw the switch . No help coming from the Soviets . And the NASA shuttle could not be rushed on line for a week at least , at utmost speed . They were doing that in any case , readying it as fast as they could . Ifp169Prometheus could get out of this orbit they still might need help . It was coming as fast as it could . If only the Air Force had their shuttle on the line now . By hindsight he could have arranged it , as a backup measure . Spilt milk again ; no point in kicking himself . It was all hush-hush and secret projects , but there was no way that secrets could be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payload , yes that was hush-hush enough , though everyone was guessing what they needed a twenty-ton capacity for . The military never stopped playing their expensive games . Bannerman had said that a shuttle was n't on line now , and he was the one who should know . But he had n't said just how long it would take to ready one . That was a thought . If it was only a day or two away it could be of help if Prometheus did get into a slightly better orbit . Ask Bannerman ? No , no point in bothering the White House again ; they were still in the cabinet meeting . Should he call the Cape itself ? As he thought this he groaned and reached for the black coffee , washing the last of the tasteless sandwich down with the cold coffee . A gourmet feast . No , he could n't think of calling directly to a classified project . Maybe two years from now they would let him know what they were doing . Then what could he do ? In through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew well enough to phone , who might cut through some of the red tape ? Among the military , no one , the engineers  --  of course ! Ask the right question , get the right answer . Wolfgang Ernsting . They had worked together countless hours before Wolfgang had opted for bigger money and secret research . One of the original Peenemunde team that Von Braun had brought . He grabbed up the phone . " I want to make a person-to-person call to Florida . " A sudden summer storm lashed rain against the windows of the tiny cubicle , rivulets of water cutting streaks through the New York soot . Cooper , Science Editor of the Gazette-Times , looked at the rain but did not see it , was not aware of it . His mind was centered on turning hard fact and soft speculation into purple prose . He gave a last chomp on his ink-stained nails to drive thep170ideas into place , then began to peck feverishly with two fingers on the ancient Underwood standard . " A greater disaster is in the making , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy of Cottenham New Town insignificant by comparison . The screaming death that hurtled out of the clear sky on that helpless city was just a single booster of the complex array of boosters , six in all , that lifted Prometheus into orbit where it now rests unstably , hurtling over our heads once every eighty-eight minutes . The boosters are toys compared to Prometheus for with its payload this vehicle weighs in excess of two thousand tons . A figure so large as to be meaningless  --  until we compare it to somethingwe know . A US Navy destroyer . An entire destroyer is up there over our heads . The weight of all those guns , armor , engines , bombs , shells , munitions , all of that weight ready to fall . And fall it will  --  and bring down with it something far worse than sheer mass . Radioactive poisoning ! For as fuel for Prometheus 's motor there is carried five hundred pounds of uranium . When Prometheushits the ground and explodes with the forces of a small nuclear bomb it will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to poisonous radioactive gas in an instant . Enough to kill two million people if it were dispersed finely enough . And where will this atomic bomb from outer space hit ? It will strike ... " Where would the damn thing come down ? Cooper thought . He turned to a Mercator map of the world that he had spread on the desk . On top of it was a transparent overlay sheet with the sinewaveshaped orbit drawn upon it . With each orbit the track changed as the Earth below revolved out from under the satellite . So ... there ... on the twenty-eighth orbit , when they had announcedit would impact the atmosphere , it would be going .. . Christ ! . . . right over the middle of the US ! Cooper shivered and looked out at the dark sky . The black birds of his predictions were coming home to roost . Far closer to his own head than he liked . " We must face all the possibilities , Mr. President , " Dr. Schlochter said , nodding as he spoke . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " I do n't want to think about it . I get an ulcer when I do . Dragoni , another bourbon and step on it . " " We must consider , I am afraid . Must consider the internationalaspects of another disaster . What this would do to our relations with the Soviet Union and with other nations . " " Hey , do we consider the five people in that thing and what we can do to help them ? " Grodzinski asked . Dillwater nodded in the direction of the Secretary of Labor , a nod that was almost a slight how of recognition . Grodzinski , for all of his gross and obvious faults , was at least thinking like a human being , about human beings . " They are not our consideration , " Schlochter said , his nostrils flared slightly . " I beg to differ with the Secretary of State , " Dillwater said . " I speak for NASA when I say the lives of those people are most valuable to us . It could not be different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bandin said , ice rattling in his glass . " But that is not what we are talking about right this moment now . This is another consideration completely . What if they do n't get that thing patched up ? What if it does come down in twenty-six hours ? Can we let it take out some American town like it did that Limey one ? How are we going to stop that ? " " There is a way , " Bannerman said . " A way to save this whole thing ? " Bandin asked . " I did not say that , Mr. President . I said there was a way to prevent Prometheus from falling and causing another disaster on Earth . " " What 's that ? " " If it could be destroyed in space  --  " " Are you saying what I 'm thinking , Bannerman ? " " I am , sir . We have defense rockets in silos and on the alert at all times to prevent a sudden nuclear surprise attack . These rockets are designed to intercept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . This would be a good test of the ability of the system . " Simon Dillwater had to fight to keep the revulsion from his voice when he spoke . " Are you talking about **26;4258;TOOLONG five human beings , General ? Three of whom are Americancitizens ? " " I am . " Bannerman was calm , unmoved . " We take far greater losses in combat during a war and no one complains . By tomorrow morning ten times that number will be dead in auto accidents on our highways . It 's not the number of lives that should be considered , nor the citizenship of the persons involved . Our only thought must be preventing a larger disaster that could be caused by the rocket striking the Earth . " " Have you thought what would happen to the Prometheus programif this were done ? " Dillwater asked . " That is not a consideration at this moment , " Bannerman answered in his coldest drillfield voice . " If you 'd done a better design job of building Prometheus we would n't be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that .... " " That 's enough ! " Bandin shouted . " You people can fight later . Now we have a problem on our hands . General , get me an up-todatereport on the defense rockets . You know , are they ready to go and so on  --  and when is the latest moment they would have to have the command to fire to knock this thing down before it hits the US . " " Yes , Mr. President . I 'll have that in a few minutes . " " How would it be done , I mean what kind of warhead ... ? " " Atomic . You 'll excuse me if I use the phone . " There was silence in the room . Grodzinski fumbled with his pencil on the table before him , looking shrunk . Dillwater was silent and erect but he could not keep the horror he felt from his face . Only Schlochter seemed unmoved . " We must plan for the worst , " he said . " The complete loss of this mission in every way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Prometheus Project as a whole . Mr. Dillwater ? " " The project . . . yes , of course . It will set us back a year at least , to replace the space station . You must realize that , after initiating construction of the generator , the vehicle with its atomic engines was to be used in high orbit as the last stage in the shuttle to ferry up the additional building materials . Without it we ca n't get the construction operating . "  | " A year . You do n't mean a year ? " Bandin said , his face gray . " I am afraid that 's the minimum , sir . " " Then that 's the election , " Bandin said . " There 'll be some cornfedyokel sitting in this chair and you will all be out of a job as well . If you do n't want that you are going to have to think of something pretty quick . " " Unless they repair the atomic engine , " Bannerman said . " That 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it 's done . " " You bet your butt on that , " Bandin said . " How are they doing , Dillwater ? What 's the status , the latest ? " " No change , Mr. President . The pilot and Dr. Bron are outside the vehicle making the repairs as instructed by Mission Control . Things are going as planned . " " How much longer ? " " I hesitate to say ... " " Force yourself . " " At a guess , and I really am guessing now , I would say that they could be finished inside another hour . " " Let 's hope they are . " " We all pray that they are , Mr. President . " GET I7:08 " It looks like a chicken wrapped up for the oven , " Ely said , looking at the great mass of crumpled aluminium foil that was wrapped round the stern of Prometheus , around the nuclear engine . There seemed to be acres of it , a mound fifty feet wide with only the mouths of the engines projecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick floating nearby in the AMU . " Well it 's a chicken we are going to have to unwrap before we can get at the engine 's guts . Which one is it ? " " On the far side , that one , there . "  |p174Patrick  worked the AMU 's controls and drifted across the base of the ship while Ely worked his way around from clip to clip . By the time he reached the site Patrick had already peeled free a great sheet of foil and was digging deeper . They labored in silence , tearing at the aluminium foil , hurling it aside so that lengths of it were soon floating away in all directions . They were pantingbefore they were done . " Are you ready to proceed with instructions ? " The voice sounded in their ears . " No we 're not and we 'll tell you when we are . " Ely snarled the words , then gasped to get his breath back . Mission Control had enough sense not to answer . His back ached , every muscle in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exhaustion . He could n't wipe away the sweat because of the pressuresuit and drops of it ran down his nose , itching and annoying . He shook his head to clear them away but it did n't work . " Are you all right ? " Patrick asked , touching the control on his AMU so that a jet of gas puffed out and floated him along the base of the engine ; he grabbed a support to stop his motion . " No I 'm goddamned well not all right . " Ely choked out the words . I do n't know how much longer I can go on . " " I 'm bushed too  --  but we have to stick with it . Right now it takes two of us . Let 's finish it then you take a rest while I go on to the hydrogen-helium heat exchanger . " " If I could only get out of this suit for a few minutes . . . . " " Negative . We do n't have the time to repressurize and start the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice cool , keep composed , but he was just as tired as Ely . Or more so , his nerves stretched taut . " No time , do you understand that ? We 've got to stick to this , there 's nothing else we can do . " " Are you ready to proceed , Prometheus ? " " No fucking lectures , Patrick , I can live without that . And shut up , Mission Control , we 'll tell you when we 're ready . I do n't know if I can do it , my eyes wo n't focus . . . . " flll'I " I 'm sorry about the lecture . This is getting to us all . " Patrick floated close to the other man , until their faceplates almost touched , reaching out a hand to Ely 's shoulder . Through the layers of fabric and plastic he could just feel the human beingp175inside when he closed his fingers hard . They were alone there in space , in the vacuum of eternity that reached away on all sides , the sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The steel shell of Prometheus was next to them , a capsule of life in the terrible emptiness , while filling half the sky was Earth . " We 've no choice , Ely , " Patrick said . " It took billions of dollars to get us up here and millions of hours of labor . And it 's all a waste if we do n't finish this job . There 's really nothing else we can do . " " Right , " Ely said . " Sorry about that . Let 's get on with it . What 's next , Mission Control ? " They had been waiting in Houston , listening in silence , powerlessto help . All they could do was describe what had to be done and hope that the two exhausted men in space would do it correctly . " The plate before you , it should have a stencilled number Peter Alfred seven six on it . There are four duz fasteners . " " Roger . Can I have the screwdriver , Pat . " Patrick unclipped the safety line and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have the big blade in it . Set for extract , minimum speed . Ready to trigger . " " Right . " Ely swung about , braced against the clip he had fastened to the hull and put the blade into the slot of the first fastener . When he pressed the trigger it whined rapidly , the flywheel inside spinning against the torque of the head , turning swiftly . " What is the . . . " Ely started to say just as the blade dug intothe aluminium and was torn from his hand . " Too fast ! " The power screwdriver floated away from them , a mote of lightin darkness . " I 'll get it  --  hold on , " Patrick shouted , kicking the AMU about and levering the gas for forward flight . He soared out after the power driver , grabbing it to him as he passed , then braked to a stop . His return flight was much slower . " You had it on high , " Ely called out angrily . " It pulled right out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , a mistake , but you should have attached the safety line . If you did this would n't have happened ... " " Ely , Patrick , the time on the GET is 17:34 , " Nadya said , herp176quiet words cutting through their angry ones . " How is the work proceeding ? " Patrick took a deep shuddering breath . " Proceeding as planned . Thanks Nadya . " " Would you like me to relieve one of you ? " " A very good idea . As soon as we get this plate off I 'm sending Ely in . If he transfers to the flight cabin umbilical you can take his place out here . " " I 'm all right , " Ely said . " No , you 're not . Neither am I. As soon as you feel better you can take my place . If we work in turns like this it should help us all . Now get on with the plate . " " Right . " The plate was finally free , disclosing a maze of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black cable with a green tracer ? " " It looks like a lot of spaghetti , " Ely said , moving his head closer . " This looks like it , yes , green markings . " " You are going to have to cut it . You 'll find if you pull up there is some give and you can work a loop of it up high enough . " " It 's . . . not easy ... " " Let me see if I can get a hand on it , " Patrick said , drawing himself close . Each pulling , they managed to get a black arch of the cable up from the others below , two , three inches high . " It 'll be a bitch to cut , " Patrick said . " Too thick for any of the tack we have . We 'll have to burn it through . " " Is n't that dangerous , with the other wires just behind ? " " Our only choice . Fire up the torch and pass it down to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they had clipped the tools . He detached the oxyacetylene torch and fastened it to a loop of his own umbilicals . Then he turned on the automatic gas regulator and thumbed the spark switch . The shining exhaust of frozen gas particles turned to a lance of flame . " Here it is  --  " " WATCH OUT ! " Patrick shouted the words  --  too late . As he turned with the flaming torch Ely did not see the top ofp177his own umbilicals floating up before him . The umbilicals seemed to have a life of their own as the slightest motion started them moving , the motion passed along their length like some half-sentientserpent . The loop reared up and the flame burned into it . Patrick grabbed the torch , turned it off  --  and they both looked in frozen horror at the blackened oxygen hose . It had been half burnt through , the wire-wound outer casing penetrated , the flexible inner rubber lining swelling out in a great blister . Only for an instant did it stay like that for even as they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his air bubbled out in a torrent of crystals , the sound of his voice getting weaker and weaker as the air that carried the sound ebbed away . " Hold your breath ! " Patrick shouted . " Hold your breath , I 'll get you inside . " He grabbed the burst hose in his glove but could not contain the gas which bubbled out between his fingers . " Inside ! Nadya , start pressurizing now , we need every second . " He seized Ely with his free hand and worked the jets on the AMU , a short hard blast , then a course correction , full on . It was a crawling pace , a drift towards the distant safety of the open hatch , floating forward with the loops of the umbilical trailing out behind . Patrick had his faceplate close to Ely 's and could see his mouth shut , then his eyes , slowly , with ice crystals already beginning to form on them . The open hatch . Brake , grab the edge . Then shove the unconscious man through it , pushing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the air inlet , " he called out , fumbling with the belt that held him to the AMU , disentangling himself from it and forcing himself to take the time to clip it to a ring in the hull before diving through the hatch . The very last thing he did was to t . lose the valves and disconnect himself from the air supply of the AMU . Holding his breath , not taking the time to reattach inside , closing the hatch . The white snow of the air turned to invisible gas as the atmospherewas pumped into the flight cabin . Nadya was bending over the still form on the floor . Patrick jumped to the pressure gauge.  |p178Quarter  atmospheric , good enough . Then he was rotating the wheel of the hatch to the crew compartment  --  was blown back asthe air rushed into the only partially pressurized cabin . Nadya was turning Ely 's helmet , removing it .

" " Give me running reports on respiration , pulse and heart , " Corettacalled out as she put the oxygen mask over Ely 's face andtriggered the valve . " Get this suit off him so we can use artificial respiration . " She let the oxygen tank drift away and bent her lips to his , sealing his nose with her hand , giving him the kiss of life . Aware of the crystals of frozen perspiration on his icy skin . " We have treatment suggestions from the medical team , Prometheus , are you ready to copy ? " " Copying , " Nadya said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick slumped , he would have fallen if there had been gravity , totally exhausted by the last spurt of effort .

No one dared to answer.  |p179GET  17:45 " Mister , it 's gone a quarter to eleven at night . The old Smithsonianbeen closed maybe five hours now . Ai n't no one there .

The cab driver stopped before the entrance and looked carefully into the shadows before he opened the back door . " There 's a night bell under that light there , street looks okay now , " he said . " Thank you , I would n't worry too much , " Weisman said , climbing out of the cab . " I got reason . A girl mugged and killed last night just a block from the White House . This ai n't Funsville .

Do you have her address or her home phone number ? " " Listen mister , we 're closed . And we ca n't give out that kind of information anyhow . " He started away , then reluctantly turned back when the bell started ringing again . " You do n't understand , this is an emergency , a matter of life and death really .

" The doctor said to come to her place because I said you had a cab waiting . The address is 4501 out on Connecticut . " " Yes , thank you , very much indeed . " Weisman dropped happily into the security of the cab and dabbed at his forehead as they drove . By the time they had crossed the bridge in Rock Creek Park he was feeling better . Dr. Tribe would know what to do . She made him sit down and have a cup of coffee while she listened to him . As he explained she forgot her own coffee which cooled before her .
