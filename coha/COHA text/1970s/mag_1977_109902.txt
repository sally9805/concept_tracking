For every hour of sports on network television there are eight to 10 minutes of advertising ; in 1976 that added up to more than 160 hours of commercials intermingled with kickoffs , pickoffs , tipoffs and teeoffs . During these moneymaking interludes the event 's performers often appear , endorsing everything from American Express cards to weed trimmers . O. J. Simpson leaps over airport railings for Hertz as agilely as he eludes would-be tacklers for the Buffalo Bills . Pel ? uses the same deft footwork for Pepsi that he employed in Cosmos games . Even Marvelous Marv Throneberry , the symbol of early Mets ineptness , is in the act , appearing in Miller Lite Beer commercials 14 years after his baseball career ended . In one of his one-line closers he says , " I still do n't know why they want me to do this commercial . " // The answer , Marv , is elementary . Sports programming , which long ago consumed weekend afternoons , now stretches into prime time . So advertisers , citing the proliferation of sports shows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are snatching up star jocks , both active and retired , to peddle their wares . Joe DiMaggio got $1 million for signing a three-year deal that changed his name from the Yankee Clipper to Mr. Coffee . For selling Magnavox television sets for two years , Henry Aaron has pocketed a million bucks . Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill spins for Bristol-Myers ' Short &amp; Sassy hair treatment , decathlete Bruce Jenner wolfs Wheaties , Tiger Pitcher Mark Fidrych sings a couple of bars for Aqua Velva and Joe Namath pops corn and cooks hamburgers for Hamilton-Beach and models pantyhose for Hanes . In 1975 Namath also agreed to lend his name to Faberg ? for 10 years at $500,000 per . // Riding high on every advertising executive 's list is Simpson . Advertising Age named the Juice the No. 1 presenter of 1977 , citing his work for Hertz and TreeSweet orange juice . Simpson out-scored 20 other finalists , including Hamill and DiMaggio , by earning high grades in credibility , persuasiveness , sales effectiveness , image and merchandisability . In layman 's terms , he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car business . // Actually Hertz had never taken a backseat in sales volume . But two years ago the company decided that it was image-less . Ted Bates Advertising Agency formulated a television campaign that stressed speedy service and adopted the Superstar-in-Rent A Car slogan . Then the search for a spokesman began . // " We used the subtract one , multiply by 20 technique to choose our celebrity , " says Mark Morris , the campaign 's director . " First , the idea has to stand on its own merit without any one celebrity . Then if we could 've named 20 others who could 've done as well as the star we used , our celebrity had failed . " This time both the concept and the celebrity passed the test . Hertz ' sales soared by 50%. // Simpson 's race was never an issue . In fact , more and more black athletes appear in advertisements , which 10 years ago featured neither blacks nor athletes . Bill Russell 's 20-foot hook shots on behalf of Ma Bell in 1974 went a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson 's selection did not involve racial considerations . " With hindsight we could say what a terrific idea it was to use a black athlete , " he says , " but in our minds O.J. was a superstar who stood for speed . Then  --  P.S.  --  he happened to be black . Actually Simpson is without color , which is not to say he is white but that he is beyond any ethnic identification in his projection. " // In advertising , projection is everything . The key to acceptance by customers is how likable the public believes a product 's spokesman to be . Market Researcher Alan J. Nelson has found that the more congenial an endorser appears , the more credible he will be as a salesman . Ability on the field is valuable to the athlete only in gaining the exposure necessary to attract an advertiser 's attention . For example , of the 192 jocks evaluated by Nelson , Muhammad Ali ranked third in public awareness , but because many people neither trusted nor liked him he finished 190th in commercial appeal . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial , brought to you by Miller 's Lite Beer . But 16 retired athletes do . In choosing its salesmen , Miller had to comply with an FCC regulation that forbids active athletes from endorsing alcoholic beverages . So former stars such as Yankee Manager Billy Martin , Celtic Coach Tommy Heinsohn and pro football 's Deacon Jones and Paul Hornung received hefty checks . // The Miller gang has become so linked in the public 's mind with Lite Beer that the members can no longer sit at a bar without some stranger sending over a round of the brew . And when Heinsohn flew into Ohio for a basketball clinic last summer , the man who picked him up at the airport whipped out a can of Lite Beer and chewed the top off with a few quick bites . // " Do you think I could try out for a Lite Beer commercial ? " asked the sharp-toothed driver . Heinsohn gave him the number to call for an audition . His services were never used , but Miller borrowed his idea for one of its 30-second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top off the can . // Miller 's use of jock commercials has helped to increase its annual sales by 43% . That is just the sort of number companies love to put in their annual reports , and it is no surprise , considering the dollars jock commercials have earned for Hertz , Miller and others , that Madison Avenue is fast becoming a sportsman 's paradise .
