For ? the first time in recent months a senior administration official has indicated that both Israel and the Arab sides are to blame for " lost - opportunities " - for **25;1158;TOOLONG and both must do something to bring about a settlement . Iniplied is a criticism of the Israelis as well as the Arabs . - ? President Nixon , in a foreign-aid bill now before Congress , has called for , a cut in support assistance to Israel and at the same time proposed increased financial aid to Jordan and military-credit sales for Saudi Arabia . The amounts are small , but the actions strike some observers as noteworthy . - ? In a little-noticed speech early this week , Joseph J.

It Is time , he said in effect , for the parties to sit down , set their options and priorities , and decide what is most important . ' // Both photos by Gordon N.

Because the occasion was the celebration of Israel 's 25th anniversary , his remarks took on added significance . Mr. Sisco introduced no new elements , and he reaffirmed Washington 's continuing support for Israel 's security . But he seemed to be telling the gathering that while Israel may be comfortable woth the present situation in the Middle East the United States is not . That situation , lie said , is " unstable and unsatisfactory . " Myths ' assailed Clearly making a conscious effort to be balanced , the high State Depart ; me nt ,  --  official . assails dcertain " myths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the Israeli side , for instance , was the " myth " that , the 1967 war was the result of a " calculated Arab plan to launch a war of destitiction against Israel . " " In my view , " said Mr. Sisco , " the most plausible explanation is that the six-day war resulted from improvised actions and reactions by each side . " These and other comments were not received with total ' enthusiasm by the gathering . Israelis were disturbed by them , and Israel 's new Ambassador to the United States , Simcha reportedly discarded a prepared speech ? to respond to Mr. Sisco 's allusions to " Myths . " , Administration officials say Mr. Sisco 's apeech does not represent any change whatever in U.S. policy although it may reflect a different style of approach .

Approach criticized Aid for Israel is cited as one area where a more businesslike approach is in order . This fiscal year the Israelis received about $500 million worth of military and economic aid , including $50 million in supporting-assistance grants . The administration asks that this sum be cut to $25 million in 1974 and that a $31 million grant in 1973 for the resettlement of Jewish emigrants ? a grant put in by Congress ? be dropped altogether . Some U.S. officials believe that even the $25 million grant should be questioned on economic grounds . They note that Israel 's foreign-ex change reserves have tripled in the last three years and now stand at $1.6 billion . It is argued , also , that Israel is a country with full employment and an economy growing annually at ' a healthy rate of about " 8 percent .

But , it is countered here , Israel 's ability to service the debt is excellent because of its growing exports . ? , Assessing the-new aid request , officials say that purely domestic budgetary considerations dictated the decision to cut back Israel 's grant . It is suggested that the acceleration of aid to Israel in the past few years is tapering off because Washington can not go on indefinitely adding aid requirements . ? AP plsolo ?
