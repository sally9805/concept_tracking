In late September , the Portland Oregonian carried a syndicated column by Chicago Daily News Writer Mike Royko lambasting the average automobile salesman as a " sneaky liar " and lamenting the fact that " the cornerstone of our economy is based on double-talking , deceitful confidence men . " Warming to his subject , Royko added : " No other major industry takes it for granted that we know the salesmen are lying and that they know we know they are lying . Even an alderman tries to keep up an honest front . " <P> The splenetic outburst was sent out to 100 papers but stirred up organized protest only in Portland . There the Auto Dealers Association decided to withdraw , for 30 days , their classified ads in the Newhouse-owned Oregonian and its sister paper , the Oregon Journal . " Not that we were trying to intimidate or look for power , " explained Chevrolet Dealer Ron Tonkin . " We just wanted to be heard . " <P> Oregonian Publisher Robert Notson , whose paper stands to lose at least $100,000 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy the loss of business , but I also do n't enjoy the suggestion that an outside group can in effect shape our editorial policy . " The paper conceded in an editorial note , however , that Royko 's " generalizations " were " unwarranted , certainly in the Portland area . " <P> By week 's end the dealers were beginning to act a little sheepish about the whole affair . One of their colleagues , Chevrolet Dealer Lyman Slack , called the boycott " as poor a display of business judgment as I 've seen in many a year . " <P> Meanwhile , car dealers all over Chicago were phoning Mike Royko in protest . In a follow-up piece he wrote that he would stand his ground until " I start hearing from happy car buyers and satisfied service-department customers . " The Oregonian prudently decided not to run the second column .
