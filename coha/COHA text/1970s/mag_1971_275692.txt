Blackheath is a respectable but hardly fashionable London suburb , its casual greens bordered with militarily regular rows of staid brick homes . Mrs. Roy Hodges , the mistress of the house at 51 Harvey Road , seems as unexceptional as the setting . She does her own grocery shopping , spends a great deal of her time tending to her two-year-old son while her husband runs his small art gallery . She is 34 , relaxed , intelligent and plain . <P> What does set Mrs. Hodges apart is that under her maiden name , Glenda Jackson , she has recently become one of the most important actresses in Britain and the U.S. as well . Despite a sallow complexion , slight figure and somewhat crooked teeth , she has drawn accolades for her enigmatic , sexually energetic characterizations . Her intricate rendition of the D.H . Lawrence heroine Gudrun in Women in Love won her an Oscar last week at the Academy Awards in Hollywood . <P> Chance to Explore . Earlier , Glenda 's performance as Gudrun had garnered the best actress awards of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Film Critics , and she received high praise for the role of Peter Tchaikovsky 's nymphomaniac wife in The Music Lovers .

" <P> Her own past , both private and professional , is as real as her present . The eldest of four daughters of a North Country bricklayer , she left school at 16 to join an amateur theater group and supported herself selling purgatives and eyedrops behind a chemist 's counter . She won a two-year scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art , then embarked on what she calls " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1964 , Peter Brook invited her to join the Royal Shakespeare Company , where she participated in his experimental theater of cruelty . <P> Hard and Cold . When Brook opened his shocking and magnificent Marat Sade , with Glenda playing the mad , murderous Charlotte Corday , her performance was one of the truly curdling experiences in contemporary theater ; it gained her widespread attention in London and New York . It also created a mold that was both rewarding and discomfiting . " I really loathed that play , " she admits . " It was so hard and cold . There was very little interaction , since all the inmates were operating on separate levels of madness . But at least by the time I left it , I did n't have to scratch for work any longer .
