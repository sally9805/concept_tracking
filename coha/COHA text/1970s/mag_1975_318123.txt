Sex Researchers William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson think that they have been misunderstood : their famed 1966 book Human Sexual Response was widely interpreted to suggest that good sex , like golf , is a matter of technique . A second book , Human Sexual Inadequacy ( 1970 ) , dealt partly with the emotions but because of its scientific jargon , failed to erase their image as the high priests of sex-as-mechanics . <P> Now Masters and Johnson have produced a nontechnical book that they expect to clear their name : The Pleasure Bond ( Little , Brown ; $8.95 ) , written by Robert J. Levin , an editor of Redbook , from taped interviews with the researchers and taped seminars that they conducted in 1971 and 1972 . For Virginia Johnson , Masters ' wife since 1971 , the book is a decade late : she wanted to write about the human problems of sex in the 1960s , but her doctor-husband insisted that they establish professional credentials by writing up their lab experiments first . Now , at last , she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the drain-I 'm tired of it . " <P> Extramarital Sex . As surveyors of the sexual scene , Masters and Johnson seem to be neoconservatives , impatient with moralists and simple-minded sexual acrobats alike . Group sex and mate swapping are fine for some , they say , but very few can handle them . Extramarital sex is not deplorable , if both partners approve , but it should be used only as a last resort to save a marriage . Exactly under what conditions this would be appropriate is left fuzzy by the authors . The clear argument of the book is that sex should mean commitment , " developing a long-range relationship rather than concentrating it all on short-term pampering of the individual self . " Yet the authors seem pulled between the views that sex is basically a search for simple pleasure ( " sex-sex " ) and that it is loving commitment ( " love-sex " ) . Like word-juggling medieval theologians , they end up arguing that real pleasure brings commitment and real commitment brings pleasure . <P> Much of what the authors recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touch more , stop working so hard at sex if they want to enjoy it , and let sexual awareness flow through their daily lives instead of confining it to half an hour in bed . Though likable and warm , Masters and Johnson are not much given to humor . But when one woman vaguely says that she wants to have children so she can watch something develop and grow , Johnson adroitly advises : " Get a plant . " <P> Unfortunately , the book 's prose style is a cross between " Dear Abby " and early Chinese fortune cookie ( " There are none so frightened as those who will not concede their fear " ; " Life is rarely without pain as well as pleasure , unhappiness as well as happiness " ) . But squeezed in amid the aphorisms are three nuggets of information : masturbation can relieve menstrual cramps ; women seem more sexually responsive about two months after childbirth because of the increased blood supply to the pelvis ; and in the first hour of sleep after orgasm , the woman usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he is.
