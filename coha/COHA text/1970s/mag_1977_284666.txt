Ravel : Bolero ; Debussy : La Mer ; Prelude a l'Apres-midi d'un Faune . <P> ( Chicago Symphony Orchestra , Sir Georg Solti conductor , London . ) As one would expect , Solti 's Bolero is a knockout . But the real interest here is the Debussy . The years have given Solti a welcome relaxation , and he is now getting around to the swirling softness of French musical impressionism . There are no mists in Solti 's Debussy . The sky is clear blue over his La Mer , but how shimmering those eddies of string tone , how thundering the waves of brass . Afternoon of a Faun may just be the most sensual on records . <P> Dvorak : Symphony No. 7 in D-Minor . ( London Philharmonic Orchestra , Carlo Maria Giulini conductor , Angel ; Concertgebouw Orchestra , Amsterdam , Colin Davis conductor , Philips . ) No other of Dvorak 's nine symphonies equals the nobility and deep melancholy of this landscape of rich melody and subtly changing orchestral color . The warm , spacious performance by Giulini would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , it comes up against Davis and the Concertgebouw in one of their most electrifying collaborations . The lilting Czech dance rhythms in the Scherzo , for example , have the kind of freedom and spontaneity one would expect from a string quartet . <P> Bach : Partitas No. 1 in B-Flat and No. 2 in C-Minor . ( Igor Kipnis harpsichordist , Angel . ) As musical forms go , the Baroque suite or partita was in its old age when Bach decided to have the final word on the subject . He not only included every kind of dance movement previously used ( saraband , gigue , minuet ) but also introduced some that had not been : capriccio , rondeau and scherzo . The French style of ornamentation , so essential a part of this music , is something Harpsichordist Igor Kipnis has long since mastered . His mordents , appoggiaturas and other embellishments have the ring not of frivolity but , as is proper , indispensability . The overall interpretations have a breadth and power not often encountered in these works . <P> Albeniz : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianist , Connoisseur Society ; 2 LPs . ) Enrique Fernandez Arbos ' glittering orchestrations helped make El Puerto , Triana and the ten other pieces in Iberia popular throughout the world . But , as Alicia de Larrocha has proved over the years in three recordings of the suite , the piano originals are as atmospherically Spanish as one could wish and , in the end , preferable . Here is a recording by the French American Michel Block that not only challenges De Larrocha 's supremacy , but topples it . Block 's playing has an earthy swagger and poetic sweep that the lady from Barcelona can not match . <P> Brahms : Piano Concerto No. 1 in D-Minor . ( Chicago Symphony Orchestra , Fritz Reiner conductor , Arthur Rubinstein pianist , RCA . ) This performance , recorded in mono in 1954. remains the pianist 's grandest reading of the work , and Reiner 's surging accompaniment turns it into the most satisfying D-Minor on records . The new reissue is not in mono or in phony stereo , however . Back in 1954 , four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the technique , and taped this performance simultaneously but separately in stereo . The results can stand comparison with many of today 's recordings .
