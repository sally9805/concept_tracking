Three old things , ONE , TWO , and THREE , are sitting in their chairs on a farmhouse porch . It 's a front porch with a low roof so that the ambiguity that passes for their faces is in specific shadow . When a face comes out of shadow by virtue of a rocker 's forward motion , its distortions are apparent : a nose slightly misplaced , an alien eyelid , an oddly long upper lip . ONE and THREE are in rocking chairs , TWO is not . TWO has a hard time . Their bodies appear to be jointed in ways unknown to us . Movement of one extremity precipitates the movement of other , unrelated limbs . The whole performance is as uncomfortable and as choreographed as TWO and THREE 'S hard New England accents . ONE 'S diction is not regionally identifiable , though it is clearly " country . " ONE is always played by a woman ; TWO and THREE are more or less male . They are lit as for a comedy . Number TWO takes out its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pile of old newspaper clippings , rifles it , sets it down . Then THREE snaps its suspenders , right and left . They repeat their motions out of order . Then ONE , TWO , and THREE begin to rock rapidly , then more slowly , as they lose all interest in self-propulsion . The rocking declines at different rates . TWO ( settling down ) Been quite a fall . p. 3 THREE I guess so . ONE Uh-huh . Pause TWO ( searching for another topic ) Hardest January I can remember . THREE ( agreeing ) Wilkes boys froze to death right in front a their wood stove . ONE ( shuddering ) Thank god for the thaw . THREE Needed a thaw to pry those Wilkes boys out a their rocking chairs .

TWO ( quashing it ) Whole lot a mud , if y ' ask me . THREE Ruts up the road something awful . TWO Thaw 's no good for anything . THREE That 's right .

ONE Barns could n't be reached . Cows could n't be milked and horses could n't be fed . On the 15th day when the barn doors at last were opened , the people saw that the stalls and stanchions were running in blood . In their hunger the horses had eaten each other and in their agony the cows had strangled themselves in their ties . Pause p. 6 TWO ( shaking its head ) Spring 's a long ways off .

THREE Always had a lot a spunk , them Lillies . ONE Well , the fire flared up quick as a cat and ate its way right through that old kitchen . As the blaze raged around them , Margaret got a strangle hold on Ruth , and Ruth set her teeth into Margaret 's nose . p. 8 TWO ( an aside ) Ruth still has all her teeth . THREE ' Magine that . TWO ( nodding ) All them teeth at seventy-three .

Their weird collection of rag-bag farm clothes reflects the changed season : there is more of the torn T-shirt and safety pin influence and less of straps , hooks , buckles and overcoats . The country view front and back is the same but there is no longer a dog sleeping in the dooryard . Pots of draggled geraniums , lobelias , and ageratums droop from hooks on the underside of the porch roof and flats of unhealthy looking tomato plants surround the rocking chairs It is clear that all the living things on stage are struggling to recover from some malefic fact of nature . ONE , TWO , and THREE are struck , suddenly , by the weak sunlight of early spring . As usual no one moves , then , very slowly , as though awakening from a hundred-year hibernation , the three things begin small stretches and great yawns  --  and a series of uncomfortable shiftings on their inappropriate seats .
