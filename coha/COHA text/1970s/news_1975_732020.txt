txt Letters to the Editor Letters to the Editor Unemployment : To Keep Labor Disunited To the Editor : The largest single increase in the Federal budget this year was for unemployment insurance . Annual payments are now estimated at over $20-billion . In addition , the recent tax cut cost $22 billion . This total alone ( $42 billion ) could easily provide five million jobs in needed areas of work such as health , transportation , education , environmental conservation . Moreover , the workers thus employed would pay taxes and purchase goods , with the multiplier effect extending the benefits far beyond the initial input . Unemployment insurance , on the other hand , produces no services or goods . A recent Congressional Research Service study reports that it would be possible to reach a level of 3 per cent unemployment by the end of 1976 . The net cost of this program at the end of the first year , after taking into account returns to the Government in income and Social Security taxes , as well as reduced unemployment insurance payments , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs lost , the Government loses $16 billion in revenue ? $2 billion in unemployment insurance payments and $14 billion in taxes . Surely job creation is less costly . Why is it not the favored method of dealing with the current economic crisis ? Why is full employment rejected as being too costly , when in essence far more expensive programs are being accepted ? Why is the economy being deprived of the goods and services that would be produced by full employment ? Some argue that full employment would produce huge Federal deficits which are in turn inflationary . Actually , the data indicate that the deficits arising from unemployment seem to be at least as great as those that would be incurred if we moved toMideast : On the Need For Balanced Trade-Offs To the Editor : Coleman Burke 's letter July 5 sounds as unreasonable as some of the strictures of the J.D.L. It is easy enough to agree with Mr. Burke that Israel must ultimately agree to return to the 1967 borders , except for unsubstantial adjustments and except for Jerusalem , for which some special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , ' to argue that a beleaguered nation should give up territorial features that it considers strategically vital to its defense for something as intangible and uncertain as " ... when finally the Arabs . . will accept Israel as an independent country . " In view of the Arabs ' record of rejection of the Balfour Declaration and of the U.N . 1947 partition plans  --  both more favorable to the Arab cause than the 1967 situation  --  it seems rather unfair to accuse Israel of " incredible ingratitude " for wanting to examine closely the quid pro quo of any required concession . It is the weakness of the step-bystep approach that well-balanced trade-offs are rarely possible . If world opinion and American thought require Israel to give up substantially all land ( with the exception of Jerusalem ) acquired in the 1967 war , is it not fair and proper for the world and the U.S. to demand that , in return , the Arab states and Israel should sign a peace and nonaggression treaty ? It is a very serious matter to try to To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Firings ? " you stated that " Borough President Percy E , Sutton , members of the Manhattan Borough Improvement Board and seven City Council members " recently suggested that a wage freeze by voluntary agreement between city and municipal unions should help overcome the budget gap . Actually , it was seven out of the nine City Council members of the Borough Improvement Board who endorsed the statement . As one of the dissenting members , I wish to agree with your sincere concern about the city 's fiscal crisis but to express my alarm at your losing sight of certain fundamental values . After many years of struggle , our city 's workers won the right to collective bargaining , a right taken for granted by most workers today . To suggest that arbitrary conditions be laid down prior to negotiations or that existing contracts be unilaterally abrogated is to recommend a return to primitive labor management relationships . Workers in city agencies , with their intimate knowledge of the city 's services , could themselves contribute valuable suggestions for cost savings which might well prevent " pink slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full employment economy . There must be same other reason . There must be something about unemployment that is important enough to the Administration to make various income transfer payments , such as unemployment insurance , welfare , food stamps and health insurance , attractive to conservative politicians . George Meany , in a recent speech , suggested that the Administration prefers unemployment because it keeps labor weak and wages down , and it " disciplines the work force . " No longer do we hear people talking about the quality of work , as they did in the sixties . Instead , massive layoffs have caused conflicts within labor over the seniority system versus affirmative action . Perhaps it is not the cost of full employment that is decisive but rather that unemployment keeps the work force disunited and quiet . The Administration would rather pay for this than for jobs .

TREVES New York , July 5 , 1975 ? The Hot Offices To the Editors I can not resist replying to Constance R. Hamilton ( letter July 1 ) and others in regard to the summer hours of city employes . The Municipal Building in New York City was built in 1909 . I wish that the writer of the letter or maybe the city desk editor would pay a visit to Room 1902 , where I work , and see for himself some of the fans ( in good working condition ) that were installed fifty years ago . True , there are some air-conditioners , but they are in the rooms which have machinery , data processing and printing equipment , for the simple reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SOLOMON FLEISCHMAN Brooklyn , July 2 , 1975 The sacrifices that the recession necessarily entails should be borne equally by all those who participate in the city 's economy . As the constricted budget is now conceived , " Big Mac " guarantees the financial community high investment returns , and the fuel cost pass-along law guarantees the landlords higher rents in spite of the $515 million outstanding in delinquent property taxes . The burden of the city 's financial distress has been shifted to its low- and middle-income citizens through fewer services , sales taxes , unemployment and the high rate of inflation , which has severely depressed real wages . There are other alternatives . Just as the Mayor 's campaign against scofflaws has picked up extra millions , I believe that a similar crisis crusade could pick up a major part of the $515-million due the city In property taxes  --  a most reasonable method of helping close the budget gap rather than by shifting additional burdens onto the shoulders of the city 's working people with a wage freeze .

In the light of all that has happened in Vietnam , it is astounding to read on your June 29 Op-Ed page a speech by Bundy that is so lacking in grasp of the Vietnam lesson . In the space of a single paragraph , Mr. Bundy compounds one error upon another . He says " . . - the case of Vietnam is unique . It does not make sense to set as a central objective the redesign of our foreign and defense policy so as to avoid ' another Vietnam ' . .. . the particular set of circumstances which led to the American role in Vietnam is most unlikely to be repeated . " To answer Mr. Bundy point by point , let us understand that the case of Vietnam is not unique . It is basically a desire of the poverty-ridden peasantry to secure a few more bowls of food and a few more tiles for their shanties . They will reject foreign patrons and any of their own leadership who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not America understand that this syndrome is universally typical ? Well it could be called the central problem of the world today . Perceiving these conditions , then most certainly America does need to redesign its foreign and defense policy so as to avoid another Vietnam . The very least we can do is stay out while the underdeveloped nations undergo their individual ordeals of regeneration . It would be better still if we would peacefully help them while continuing to exemplify free democracy for all to see . Although Mr. Bundy feels otherwise , the American role , as in Vietnam , may very likely be repeated . It could begin with Korea . Moreover , the woeful condition of the people , which led to Vietnam , obtains in Chile , , Peru , Bolivia , the Dominican Republic , Haiti , Cuba , Indonesia , Mozambique , Brazil , India , Somali and in many other nations . We should quake for our future if the lesson of Vietnam , for which we paid so high a price , is not thoroughly absorbed by our national leadership . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1975 The writer is a former member of Congress from New York . ? In Praise of the Library To the Editor : In these days of declining and inadequate city services I would like to say a few words of praise for the New York Public Library . With one phone call to a courteous and helpful employe , I learned what I needed to do to get a library card and where I could go to find the kind of books I was looking for . I walked into the mid-Manhattan branch , and within a half-hour I had obtained a card , found the books I was looking for in the catalog and discovered the shelves were well-stocked with an excellent collection of books in my field of study .

The questionable decision of the President and the Secretary of State to ignore the presence of Nobel laureate Solzhenitsyn seems most cowardly . What kind of a fragile d  --  tente do we have that can be so easily shattered by greeting this courageous champion of freedom ? Editorial July 4 . MARIE GORDON New York , July 5 , 1975 ? To the Editor : It seems to me that one aspect of President Ford 's shameful refusal to greet Nobel laureate Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn deserves special notice : According to The Times of July 3 , certain White House aides argued against a meeting by raising questions about Mr. So/zhenitsyn 's " mental stability . " Until now , this canard , applied to many Soviet writers and citizens who displease - the regime , has been the special property of the K.G.B .

Y. , July 4 , 1975 A Case Against a City Wage Freeze ? Air Crash : A Good Team To the Editor : As director of the Medical Office at J. F. Kennedy International Airport , I wish personally to commend the police of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for the efficient and dedicated manner in which they functioned during the recent Eastern Airlines crash . The Police and Fire Departments of the City of New York are indeed worthy of similar praise for their efforts in coordination with the Port Authority police . It is a privilege to work with such a splendid team . LEON D. STAR , M.D. Jama4a , N. Y. , July 1 , 1975 '
