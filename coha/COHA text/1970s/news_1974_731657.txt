txt uoou management and good politics are seen here as the twin motives of Pentagon planners who have just announced plans to consolidate and , in some cases , to close , military installations around the United States . But whether the move will actually turn out to be good politically is still a matter for conjecture . The Pentagon is , in part , trying to show the new Congress how cost-conscious it can be , yet protests from lawmakers from many areas affected , involving some 111 military bases in 40 states and Puerto Rico , already have been lodged For its part , the Defense Department is carefully stressing that the consolidations were not made to cut " fat " from the defense budget , but rather to enlarge the combat strength of the military . : Navy unaffected The consolidations and closings , according to Pentagon officials , will allow more than $3 billion in funding to be transferred to " more combat capability " in the decade after 1977 , when the final changes will be made effective Main results of the planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1 percent of the Pentagon overall civilian work force of I million persons 2 Transferring 11,500 Army and Air Force personnel from support to " combat " posts over the next several years The Navy will not be affected . 3 Only two major installations will he closed ' Frankford Army Arsenal in Philadelphia , and Ellington Air Force Base at Houston . The state hardest hit by layoffs is Kentucky ( 2,900 civilian jobs ) , followed by California ( 2,700 ) , Pennsylvania ( 2,500 ) , Missouri ( 2,330 ) , Colorado ( 1,860 ) , and Texas ( 1,838 ) .

The Pentagon , currently operating under an $82.6 billion budget for fiscal year 1975 ( after initially asking for $86 billion ) , will be coming out with its new budget requests early next year .

Thus , it is thought here , in one sense at least , the present consolidations can be seen as a sound managerial decision , showing the new Congress that the Pentagon can geras much from each dollar as possible . // *Why cutbacks // The current consolidations are considered part of a long-term strategy by Defense Secretary James Schlesinger to substantially boost U.S. military might without major budget hikes .
