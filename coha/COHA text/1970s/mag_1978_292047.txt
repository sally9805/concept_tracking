In an interview with TIME Correspondent Don Sider . Labor Secretary Ray Marshall explained the thinking behind White House actions on the coal strike . <P> <P> Q. It has been suggested that perhaps the Mayor Daley school of labor relations would have helped settle the strike-that is , a subtle word last November to both sides that if they did not reach an agreement by a certain date , there would be a heavy weight falling on their heads . Do you agree ? <P> <P> A. I do n't think so . The problem with a threat is that you 've got to be ready to come through with the " or else . " You also have to believe that neither party wants the " or else . " You could n't be sure of that . Another point to remember is that it was unnecessary to threaten the negotiators to get them to come to an agreement . They reached an agreement , which was rejected by the U.M.W. bargaining council . To whom , then , should we have addressed the threat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have done ? <P> <P> A. We think it is important to keep the President out of the collective bargaining process as long as possible . The fact that we were not precipitous , that we waited a long time , that we were not going to do anything until there was a serious problem , has made people realize that the cost of involving the President is going to be pretty high . I do n't think anybody is going to sit down and say : " We 're going to take a 90-day strike in order to get presidential intervention . " This is the first time Jimmy Carter has had to intervene . We stayed out of the longshoremen 's strike and the iron-ore strike , and they were resolved . We 've communicated that we 'll do everything we can to facilitate the process , to conciliate , to supply information , but it 's your problem . <P> <P> Q. What was your basic behind-the-scenes strategy ? <P> A. Very early we established that whatever we did , we wanted production to resume . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both labor and management . One possibility that became clear was that the workers might go back to the mines , but they would n't dig much coal . That 's not going to help anybody . Nor is it going to help anybody to have management mad at us and not do a good job of managing . If either side decided to show that the Government could n't do the job , it would n't be very hard for them to prove that . <P> <P> Q. Would any changes in the labor law be helpful in a strike like this one ? <P> <P> A. It would be useful if we had more options in the Taft-Hartley Act . I would like to get the miners back to work under conditions other than an old contract , especially if it 's a three-year contract and prices have been rising substantially . In the current strike , the union 's welfare and pension funds have also been depleted . If the miners are ordered back to work , they are likely to consider it to be unfair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason we developed the idea of federal seizure of the mines as a way to compensate : an injunction on both your houses .
