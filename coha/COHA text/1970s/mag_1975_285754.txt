Once they have set a course , courts can be as slow to come about as a squarerigger in a flat calm . Now the U.S. Supreme Court has finally managed a reversal of course from a line of cases first charted in 1854 . <P> In that original decision , the high court 's Justices ruled that the financial damages resulting from a collision at sea should be divided equally among those at fault , no matter who was more responsible . But since 1910 , virtually every major nation has adopted an international maritime convention jettisoning that once common rule as unfair . Partly because cargo interests were worried about other aspects of the convention , the U.S. Senate never acted , and U.S. courts for the most part have reluctantly followed precedent . For example , when the Navy tanker Mission San Francisco was rammed by the Liberian freighter S.S. Elna II , a circuit court of appeals decided that the San Francisco 's " faults were grave , " but " with regret " divided the $3.8 million damages . <P> Egregious Fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mary A. Whalen , a coastal tanker that went aground in 1968 in gale force winds on a sandbar outside New York harbor . A flashing light maintained by the Coast Guard was not working that night , but the trial court concluded that " the fault of the vessel was more egregious than the fault of the Coast Guard . " The blame , ruled that court , was 75%-25% . Yet the damages had to be split evenly . After considering those facts , Justice Potter Stewart , a World War II naval officer , weighed the old " equal division " rule and found it wanting : " An ancient form of rough justice , a means of apportioning damages where it was difficult to measure which party was more at fault . " Said Stewart : " It is no longer apparent , if it ever was , that this Solomonic division of damages serves to achieve even rough justice . " In fact , some vulnerable owners of negligent ships have rushed to litigate in U.S. courts in order to avoid harsher justice elsewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time had come for the U.S. to assess damages in admiralty cases so as to reflect whenever possible the relative degrees of fault .
