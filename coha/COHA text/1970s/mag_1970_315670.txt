WITH spirituals , the blues , jazz and all its offshoots , blacks created the basis for American popular music . The list of famous black performers reads like a musical honor roll : Louis Armstrong , Duke Ellington , Ella Fitzgerald , Billie Holiday , Ray Charles make hardly a beginning . Despite the success of Motown , the black-owned Detroit record company ( the Supremes , the Temptations ) , black musicians have yet to win a proportionate share of credit or cash . Symptomatic statistics : from 1960 to 1970 , of the twelve popular soloists or groups receiving ten or more gold records ( signifying sales of $1 million or one million records ) , only two , the Supremes and Aretha Franklin , were black . <P> In classical music there have been recent gains . But only six blacks occupy seats in the nation 's top eleven orchestras . This is the result less of current than of cumulative discrimination . For years , blacks were barred from orchestras . The average black parent lacked-and still lacks-the money , time and inclination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a classical career demands . As a result , though the American Federation of Musicians is 10% black , there are now no more than 150 conservatory-trained black orchestral players in the U.S. <P> In opera , the scene is improving slightly . Three decades ago , Soprano Dorothy Maynor could and did prepare opera after opera without ever being invited to sing . One of the century 's finest contraltos , Marian Anderson , did not break into opera until 1955 , when she was 52 . Beyond Tenor George Shirley there are hardly any black male opera singers . But of the top eight American-born female operatic singers , four-Leontyne Price , Shirley Verrett , Martina Arroyo and Grace Bumbry-are black . <P> The black contribution to modern dance has been enormous . Performers include Katherine Dunham , the Alvin Ailey company , and many black stars like Clive Thompson , Mary Hinkson , Matt Turney and Carmen de Lavallade . But in classical ballet , there is still sharp prejudice .                  @ @ @
