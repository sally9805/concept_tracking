The first time John Hammond heard Bessie Smith sing was in October 1927 at the Alhambra Theater in Harlem . He was 16 , and , at his parents ' insistence he went to the 6 o'clock show and got home early . " Bessie did n't mess with the mike , " Hammond recalls . " She was just up there belting . She had come up before the days of the microphone , and so she had developed a pair of pipes you could n't believe . Billie Holiday and Mildred Bailey-the ones that came after her-all had small voices . You could n't hear them without a mike . But Bessie had power . " <P> Bessie had a lot more than power , as Hammond soon realized . Subtlety , intuition , presence , drama , compassion-all those and more made her the greatest female blues singer who ever lived . Six years later , on Nov. 24 , 1933 , when Bessie 's star - and fortune-had all but vanished , Hammond , who began working for Columbia Records after two years at Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session . It was no easy matter : the Depression had left Columbia virtually bankrupt . All the money that Hammond could raise for the session was $150 for Bessie ( $37.50 for each of the four sides she cut ) , and $150 split among such sidemen as Benny Goodman , Jack Teagarden and Chu Berry . Still , the session meant a lot to Bessie , and she showed it by the way she tore into Down in the Dumps : <P> I 'm always like a tiger , <P> I 'm ready to jump , <P> I need a whole lot of lovin ' <P> ' Cause I 'm down in the dumps . <P> Now Hammond is embarked on an even bigger rescue mission - the reissue of every one of Bessie 's 160 records . Columbia , somewhat wealthier these days , is releasing them in a series of five two-LP albums , each containing 32 songs , each priced at an attractive $5.98 . The first album , containing Bessie 's first acoustic recordings ( 1923 ) and her last electrics ( 1930-33 ) , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35,000 copies . That is an unprecedented feat in the history of reissues , and a surprise to everyone but Hammond . An executive producer with Columbia and the discoverer of such diverse talents as Billie Holiday , Count Basie and Bob Dylan , Hammond has a knack for making the unexpected pay off . Actually , Project Bessie Smith is timed perfectly . Blues dominate the pop music scene today in much the same way that jazz did in the late 1930s and early 1940s . <P> When Bessie Smith sang the blues , every misery , lust and hostility that had ever racked her fleshy 5-ft. 9-in. , 200-lb. frame came out in the music . Her sense of pitch was phenomenal . She could hit a note right in the middle when she wanted to , but she could also shade a vowel with any one of a thousand different flat slurs that seemed always at her disposal . Her message came out with a clear diction few lieder singers could match . She shaped a song as though its architecture were sonata form , not repetitious twelve-bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
