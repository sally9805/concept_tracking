The new military rulers of Greece moved quickly last week to consolidate their power . Within 48 hours after the Sunday morning coup that ousted the government of George Papadopoulos ( TIME , Dec. 3 ) , most tanks and troops were removed from the streets of Athens , a curfew imposed at the time of the coup was lifted , and public schools ( but not the universities ) were reopened . The junta even freed a token number of political leaders , students and workers who had been imprisoned by the previous regime after last month 's rioting . <P> The deposed Papadopoulos remained under house arrest , presumably at his suburban villa . But the ouster of the much hated former President did not mean that Greece was on the way back to democracy . In a nationally televised speech , the new civilian Premier , U.S.-educated Adamandios Androutsopoulos , announced that the junta would rule indefinitely by decree , and would not hold the national elections that Papadopoulos had promised for some time in 1974 . " We will bring our mission to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timetables or surprises . " <P> Androutsopoulos argued that the 1974 elections would have been fraudulently conducted anyway , so the nation was none the worse off for their postponement . After all , he said , the two plebiscites that Papadopoulos had conducted-one on a new constitution for Greece , another on whether the country should be a republic instead of a monarchy-had resulted in " unbelievable majorities . " Lest the people get the idea that the old dictatorship had merely been replaced by another , Androutsopoulos insisted that the junta would rule " sparingly , and always within the absolutely necessary limits for the functioning of the state . " <P> In phrases reminiscent of those used by Papadopoulos in the 1967 coup that brought him to power , Androutsopoulos spoke of the need to " cleanse " Greek society and to fight the prevailing " climate of upheaval , uncertainty and slackness . " Just about the only policies of the former regime that he did not attack were its economic programs , doubtless because he had helped to shape them as Papadopoulos ' Finance Minister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery . The new President was a relatively unknown army officer , Lieut . General Phaedon Gizikis ( who was promoted to full general three days after the coup ) . But he did not seem to be a particularly forceful figure ; in fact he went out of his way to announce , after taking the oath of office , that " I have no personal ambition . " The new Cabinet was composed of civilian rightists who had been rounded up quickly after the takeover ; some were unknowns and some were has-beens . <P> Apparently the most powerful member of the junta-and almost certainly the mastermind of the coup-was Brigadier General Dimitrios loannidis , head of the military police ( see box ) .
