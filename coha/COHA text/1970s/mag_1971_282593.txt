In Sacramento , Calif. , William Raymond , 12 , was indoctrinated at school on the evil effects of marijuana . Thus when he noticed some suspicious weed around the house , he called the local sheriff 's office . Finding 31 partially smoked joints and more marijuana stashed in plastic bags , the police arrested William 's father . In Springfield , Mass. , last week , Donald Sasen , 10 , turned in his baby sitter and three other teen-agers for smoking grass in the house . <P> A time comes , of course , when every generation begins looking over its shoulder at the next . But the moment may be confusing and even eerie when one generation that has encouraged youthful rebels-the cavaliers of the counterculture-stares back and sees . . . little roundheads closing fast . An exaggeration , no doubt . But it is engaging to think that a new breed of rebellious young may soon be seen behind the boiler , sipping martinis and mocking their pothead parents .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
