It will be the season of lame ducks , long passes , lost friends , lonesome spectators and law courts . For the National Football League , entering its 55th season , the world has flip-flopped ; 1974 is the year of change . // The old paternalistic relationship between owners and players has-become a confrontation between labor and management . The brash young World Football League has challenged the NFL 's monopoly of the sport and hired away some of its best players for future delivery . The player strike hurt the exhibition season and contributed , along with the televising of home-game sellouts , to a decline in season-ticket sales . And some of the cherished regulations that have allowed the clubs to retain players against their will are being contested in a series of court cases . Should the NFL lose these legal actions , the whole structure of the game could come tumbling down . Finally , even the playing rules have been changed . Ironically , the new rules have created a more interesting game at the very time when teams may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of bickering , the strife between players and owners subsided into a stalemate . No new contract was agreed upon ; the players returned to the field with the squabble unsettled and with only a nebulous promise of further bargaining . They had presented an unwieldy and unrealistic list of 63 demands when negotiations began , the owners did little to meet those demands , and a stalemate was inevitable . The whole distasteful and boring procedure may impair the start of the 1975 season , too . // The main sticking point for both owners and players was the Rozelle Rule , under which Commissioner Pete Rozelle decides what compensation should be made to a club losing a player to another team after he has played out his option . That rule  --  as well as the option clause  --  is being challenged in court , most notably by Joe Kapp . The Kapp case will be decided in U.S. District Court in San Francisco , where Judge William T. Sweigert will rule in a few weeks on the legality of the Rozelle Rule , the option clause and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the players may have won what they unsuccessfully struck for . // The WFL has already given NFL players an option , the best they have had since the American Football League was formed , and several dozen veterans have signed to play with the new league in 1975 or 1976 . The WFL is the equivalent of Linus ' blanket for NFL players . They did not have to work as hard in camp ; if they were cut , they could go to the WFL . Since this is true for marginal players as well as for superstars , it is difficult to evaluate the comparative strengths of NFL teams going into this season . If Larry Csonka , Jim Kiick and Paul Warfield coast  --  however subconsciously  --  in Dolphin games , how good is Miami ? // From the fans ' point of view , the only change for the better is in the rules . So far , in an exhibition season played first by rookies and rejects , then by rusty veterans , one thing has been constant : more offense . There have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punt and kickoff returns and only half as many field goals as last year . Seldom is a kickoff downed in the end zone anymore . The wide receiver is running long patterns again  --  and catching the ball . It is a more exciting game and , as the veterans shape up , the new rules should result in spectacular , high-scoring contests . And the resultless game  --  the tie  --  is all but a thing of the past , with sudden death now in effect . // So here comes a lively , unpredictable season , full of bombs and bombast . That does n't sound so bad . Kick off .
