South Africa 's Afrikaners lost the Boer War of 1899-1902 but won the country . Even so , they remain suspicious of the English-speaking white minority , and in moments of political stress , the Afrikaners-whose native tongue is related to Dutch-trot out their sacred tribal memories of the bloody fighting between Boer and Briton . Thus last week , in the midst of a parliamentary debate , Defense Minister Piet Botha declared that there were elements of the predominantly English United Party " who hate the Afrikaner . " An opposition member replied , " You 're a scandalous liar , " and walked out . One M.P . addressed another as " the Honorable Maggot . " Other Afrikaner members of the ruling National Party carried on the verbal war , calling English M.P.s " Baboons " and " Jingoes . " <P> Speaking to a gathering of Afrikaners , Prime Minister John Vorster took the Boerehaat ( Boer hate ) campaign a step further . " Because of the things that threaten us , " he cried , " we need a militant youth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war song , " I 've always been afraid the English soldiers would catch me , " adding : " If there 's any catching to be done , we will do it , and the time has now come ! " <P> The outbreak of white tribalism seemed especially curious because South Africa 's political mood has mellowed in recent years . Opposition leaders suspected that the renewal of Boerehaat could be traced to the troubles of the Afrikaner-dominated National Party , which lost eight seats in the 1970 election and faces continuing tension between its moderate verligte ( enlightened ) and archconservative verkrampte ( narrow-minded ) wings . <P> Boer War barnstorming seemed to be paying off for the Nationalist leaders . At last week 's special election in Oudtshoorn , an Afrikaner stronghold 278 miles east of Cape Town , the National Party candidate defeated both his United Party opponent and a right-wing Afrikaner splinter candidate by an unusually wide margin . " An inspiring test of strength , " beamed Prime Minister Vorster . Opposition leaders , though , insisted that Oudtshoorn-which is best known in South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national mood . " The Afrikaners here will get a shock , " said one United Party politician , " when they , like their ostriches , take their heads out of the sand . "
