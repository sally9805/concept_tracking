HENRY KISSINGER deplaned at Andrews Air Force Base after another bargaining session in Paris with Hanoi 's Le Due Tho . A reporter asked , " Do you still think that ' peace is at hand ' ? " Replied Kissinger with a smile : " That 's a great phrase . Who used it ? " <P> The Kissinger coyness that is so delightful at times was misplaced last week . His " at hand " formulation , the attention-grabbing quote given in his dramatic press conference on Oct. 26 , had instantly inflated hopes for an end to the long agony of Viet Nam . Now this optimism was dealt a heavy blow . At a Saturday news conference , Kissinger changed his evaluation considerably . " Peace can be near , " he said , but-and this " but " loomed frighteningly large-North Viet Nam would have to decide to resume bargaining " in good faith , " as defined by the U.S. Yet Kissinger revealed that his latest round of talks in Paris had failed to yield an agreement satisfactory to Richard Nixon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration 's report of progress , the credibility of Nixon and Kissinger is clearly on the line . Kissinger gave no hint of that as he laid all of the blame for delay on Hanoi . He charged that Hanoi had suddenly begun raising " one frivolous issue after another . " Tho and his associates would agree on a point , then retract it or try to make substantive alterations " in the guise of linguistic changes . " <P> Citing one example of the difficulty in negotiating , Kissinger noted that Hanoi was arguing that a 250-man international truce-supervision team , without any Jeeps , telephones or radios of its own to use in investigating violations , would be adequate . The U.S. believes that a fully equipped force of at least several thousand is necessary . " The North Vietnamese perception of international machinery and our perception is at drastic variance , " said Kissinger . <P> Despite all of the differences newly injected by Hanoi , Kissinger contended that most were readily reconcilable if the Communists would only return to the cooperative spirit shown last October . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we are one decision away from a settlement . " Kissinger did not spell it out , but it was apparent that this question touched on one of the fundamental issues of the entire war : are there two Viet Nams engaged in international conflict , or is there one country temporarily divided by an arbitrary frontier and engaged in a civil war ? <P> Imprudent . When the secret talks first produced a nine-point agreement between Kissinger and Tho last October , that problem was handled mainly by using vague language . The announced summary of Point 5 stated merely that " the reunification of Viet Nam shall be carried out step by step through peaceful means , " which seemed to imply that Viet Nam is divided now , but only until enough comity can be restored to permit reunification . The U.S. also agreed in Point 1 to respect the 1954 Geneva agreements , which partitioned the country only in a military sense , noting that no political or territorial boundaries were being created . In early October that language at least seemed acceptable to Kissinger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
