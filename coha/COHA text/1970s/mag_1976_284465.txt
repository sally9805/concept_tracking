" Mr. Watson , come here ! I want you ! " <P> <P> That command-shouted in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell and heard in another room by his assistant , Thomas Watson , over Bell 's first working telephone , was repeated in Boston last week . The occasion : an American Telephone and Telegraph banquet commemorating the 100th anniversary of the telephone . To demonstrate a century of progress , the teen-age descendants of Bell and Watson who re-enacted the historic moment then placed a call that was transmitted between two modern telephones not by electrical current or radio waves but by a beam of light passing through a hair-thin glass fiber . Proclaimed <P> AT &T; Chairman John deButts : " I anticipate that by the early 1980s cables of glass fibers will be carrying thousands of simultaneous messages between major switching centers in our big cities . " <P> Morse Code . The idea of using light to convey information far predates the new fiber-optics technology demonstrated so dramatically by AT &T.; Primitive man sent signals by building fires or waving torches ; ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Proof that light could be sent along a curved " pipe " - like electricity flowing through a wire-was provided by British Physicist John Tyndall in 1870 . He showed that light shining down on a tank of water could be carried by a stream pouring from a hole in the side of the tank to illuminate the spot on which the stream fell . <P> <P> It took many decades of research and three basic developments to make communication by optical wires a reality . One development was the invention in 1960 of the laser , a device capable of generating an intense narrow beam of light that , for all practical purposes , did not diverge . Miniaturized lasers make it possible to couple powerful light beams accurately with hair-fine glass fibers . Another was the perfection , by Corning Glass Works , of a fiber of glass so pure that it could transmit light long distances . The third accomplishment was the devising , by engineers at Bell Labs and elsewhere , of methods of integrating fiber optics into modern telephone systems . <P> In a conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into electrical pulses , which travel along a copper wire to another phone , where they are converted back to sound waves . In a typical optical arrangement ( see diagram ) , sound waves entering a telephone microphone are converted into electrical signals . These signals pass through an encoder , which converts them into electrical pulses that switch a laser on and off , interrupting a light beam being sent into the end of a fiber . The light thus travels in a series of pulses , not unlike Morse code , that race along the glass " wire . " At the end of their journey , these light pulses are picked up by a photodetector , which converts them back to electrical pulses . These , in turn , are fed into a decoder for translation into an electrical signal that vibrates a diaphragm in the receiver , reproducing the voice .
