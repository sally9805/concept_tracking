Since early 1973 , the world 's major currencies have been " floating " - that is , how many U.S. dollars or Japanese yen a German mark , say , can buy has been determined by the forces of supply and demand in foreign exchange markets and not , as in the past , by government fiat . The system seemed to work well for a while . Now , however , a growing number of Europeans are concluding that floating rates have been a failure . The harshest critic has been France , which last week ceased to allow the franc to float freely against all other money . Instead , it will rejoin a European fixed-rate scheme known as the snake-that ties the values of seven currencies to each other . <P> Many policymakers and bankers in Europe are assailing floating rates partly on the argument that they have not , as promised , ended speculative swings in world currency markets . Instead , currency fluctuations have intensified ( see chart ) and losses as the result of miscalculations have grown larger . Banks such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzerland and the now defunct Franklin National in the U.S. lost heavily last year by guessing wrong about which way-or how far - rates would float . So did some corporations that have tried to hedge against fluctuations by contracting to buy and sell currencies at a future date : ITT lost $48 million in foreign exchange transactions in 1974 . Moans one multinational executive : " All the Harvard Business School techniques are worthless when exchange rates can move by 20% in a matter of months . " <P> Another criticism is that floating rates have not helped to solve international trade problems . Britain , for example , continues to run huge deficits despite a downward float of the pound . Its woes underscore perhaps the most basic charge against floating rates : that they encourage nations to spend more than they earn , in the false hope that a cheaper currency will correct major economic weaknesses by encouraging exports and holding down imports . In reality , says University of Chicago Economist Arthur Laffer , currency fluctuations " never solve fundamental problems . " <P> Although floating rates have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values adjust to the shock of quintupled oil prices in 1973 and early 1974 . Partly for that reason , there is no agreement that others should now follow France 's lead and shift back to fixed rates . Says Treasury Secretary William Simon : " The old system was abandoned for one simple reason . It did n't work . " Clearly , it did not work at all well during the late 1960s and early 1970s , when the industrialized nations I lurched from one chaotic monetary crisis to another . Members of the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington next month are expected to study ways of refining the floating-rate system , but they are unlikely to decide to put the world back on strict fixed rates any time soon . <P> <P> *The snake-so named because of the way its currencies wiggle together against outsiders ' money - includes the Benelux and Scandinavian countries along with West Germany . France , a charter member when the snake was formed in 1972 , dropped out early last year .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
