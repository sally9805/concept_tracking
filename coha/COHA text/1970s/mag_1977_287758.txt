THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST by OSCAR WILDE <P> Adroit , stylish , nimble , this is a first-rate revival of a classic . Here is Wilde , the autocrat of the dining table , drop ping epigrams like pearls before wine . <P> With The Importance of Being Ear nest Wilde raises frivolity to high fash ion , attains a comic nirvana through sheer nonsense . Apart from a wonderfully sly-tongued cast , which this production has , the play demands a director who can crack the combination of its elegant wit and satirical wisdom with the silky fingers of a safe robber . Stephen Porter is just that sort of director , and the stamp of his assurance is his total trust in the playwright . <P> It takes a great deal of trust . Consider some of the outlandish elements of the play : its baby found in a handbag , its imperious dowager , Lady Bracknell ( Elizabeth Wilson ) , who is " a monster with out being a myth , its one young man , John Worthing ( James Valentine ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , Algernon Moncrieff ( John Glover ) , who blithely proceeds to impersonate him . This is farce walking the tightrope of absurdity . But it is also farce at its most urbane - as insolently monocled in manner as it is killingly high-toned in language . <P> In this game of verbal lawn tennis , the two bogus brothers are matched with two demurely saucy maidens . As Cecily Car dew and Gwendolen Fairfax , Kathleen Widdoes and Patricia Conolly lob and volley Wilde 's lines with devastating precision . The Fourth of July will be a little early this year . Over Manhattan 's Circle in the Square Theater , comic flares light the night sky .
