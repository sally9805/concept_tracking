" They got Dobermans to rip your arms off . Some of these places got moats . " The speaker is Pat Angelo ( Alan King ) , a Mafioso gone straight . Plump and vested , he wants no part in a major crime planned by ex-Con Duke Anderson ( Sean Connery ) . But Duke is persuasive , the take promises to be in the millions , and what the hell , Pat misses the glorious game of cops and robbers . So he gives the green light and the dirty sport begins , with a Fifth Avenue luxury apartment house as the scene of the heist . <P> As a caper picture , The Anderson Tapes displays a slick criminal shrewdness : its paraphernalia and plans are always chillingly plausible . Had the film restricted itself to its own Rififiefdom , it would have remained as airtight as a legit alibi . But Director Sidney Lumet ( The Pawnbroker , The Group ) , who has never shown a scintilla of genuine wit , aims for nothing less than political satire . Since Duke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the cops do not know instantly . When he consults a black driver who lives above a Panther storefront , Duke 's schemes are electronically processed . T-men tune in on his conversations with Angelo ; even the apartment of Duke 's mistress ( Dyan Cannon ) is tapped by a jealous lover . As the plans unfurl , the eavesdroppers are heavily lampooned . America , in a supposedly shattering revelation , is shown to be not only a racist society but also a bugged one . <P> Nor do the comic attempts end there . Sometimes Lumet attempts to send up other movies : a one-sided encounter between Angelo and his paralyzed father is an inept parody of Jack Nicholson 's monologue in Five Easy Pieces . The film also mercilessly mocks a homosexual antiques dealer , with Martin Balsam , as they say in Hollywood , " cast against the part . " <P> Unfortunately , failed comedy and vigorous suspense are handcuffed together for the entire trip . Angelo and Duke agree to split fifty-fifty . That is a better deal than the one offered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
