STAY HUNGRY <P> Directed by BOB RAFELSON <P> Screenplay by CHARLES GAINES and BOB RAFELSON <P> Uncle Albert may be daft-he carries a small pocket telescope to spy upon squirrels-but he is still concerned about his nephew Craig . Since the death of his parents , Craig ( Jeff Bridges ) has been living in the family home on a hill outside Birmingham , with only one black servant ( Scatman Crothers ) and a lot of pictures of himself for company . " It is time , " Uncle Albert advises by letter , " to seek the comforts of your traditions . " Craig 's traditions are genteel Southern , wilted aristocratic , but they are small solace . What really compels Craig is what his deceased parents might have called " slumming . " He is fascinated by the town oddballs , turned on by the low life at the bottom of the hill . <P> Craig and a pal from the country club get themselves mixed up in a real estate deal with a trio of bad-ass good ole boys who want to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Craig 's job is to purchase a rundown hangout for body building called the Olympic Spa . The boys should have known better . Craig gets sucked into the strange rituals of the place , the exercises , the competition and-most of all - the mystical subculture of pumping iron . He makes friends with Joe Santo ( played by Arnold Schwarzenegger , himself a former Mr. World and Mr. Universe ) , and starts an intimate exercise program with Mary Tate Farnsworth ( Sally Field ) , an employee of the spa . The real estate deal gets less real , but Craig hardly gives it a thought . He is too busy searching for himself among the barbells . <P> Funky Spirit . It is an unusual place to look for truth , but Bob Rafelson makes movies ( Five Easy Pieces , The King of Marvin Gardens ) in which that search is always eccentric , the conclusion indefinite . Like Bobby Dupea , the runaway pianist of Five Easy Pieces , Craig is spiritually disenfranchised , in flagrant rebellion against his class . Craig revels in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his offbeat sense of humor , his knack for visual surprise , turns the spa into a suitably shabby field of honor . Joe Santo trains for the Mr. Universe competition by pressing weights in a Batman getup . The owner of the Olympic , a toupeed madman who calls himself Thor Erickson ( R.H. Armstrong ) , spies on Mary Tate through a peephole in the floor , finally goes berserk after inhaling a noseful of poppers and , in the film 's scariest scene , tries to rape her and murder Craig . <P> Stay Hungry is raucous , inventive and enterprising ; it is also disheveled and dishonest . Rafelson presents Craig 's peers as dissipated , insensate boors , and his family as a tribe of implacable snobs . <P> By contrast , the Olympic crew seem like wholly admirable free spirits - and the match is not a fair one . Joe Santo is a connoisseur of cut glass , an accomplished fiddle player and something of an out-of-pocket philosopher . " I do n't believe in getting too comfortable , " he tells Craig . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
