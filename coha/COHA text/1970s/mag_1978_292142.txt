THE KNOX BROTHERS by Penelope Fitzgerald Coward , McCann &; Geoghegan ; 294 pages ; $10.95 <P> Dilly said it best : " Nothing is impossible . " That conviction shaped the lives of the four Knox brothers . For Dilwyn , the second-born son , it meant breaking the vital German flag code in World War I and finding a crucial key to the Germans ' baffling Enigma machine in World War II . For Ronald , youngest and most celebrated of the four , it meant translating a Roman Catholic English Bible-Old and New Testaments-from the Latin Vulgate . For Eldest Brother Edmund it meant a painstaking ascension to the Fleet Street pantheon as editor of Punch . Wilfred , the third-born son , chose a different sort of test . An Edwardian dandy who wore silk ties from London 's Burlington Arcade , he took a vow of poverty as a workingman 's Anglican priest . <P> Biographer Penelope Fitzgerald has a blood knowledge of this charmed band of brothers . Eddie was her father ; Ronnie , Dilly and Wilfred her beloved uncles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aunt Winnie , boundlessly affectionate . " Enter Winnie , " wrote Eddie in a childhood play , " and kisses everybody . " Penelope follows Winnie 's lead : her family portrait , scrupulously honest , laced with good humor and lovingly crafted , is a valentine to the sort of family that has largely ceased to exist . <P> The Knoxes were born at a happy conjunction of piety and humanity . Grandfather George Knox had been a holy terror , a Low Church Anglican minister who tried to flog the hell out of his sons . Grandfather Thomas French , in Fitzgerald 's words , " was a saint ... and as exasperating as all saints , " a gifted linguist and longtime missionary to India who would squat in the marketplace of Agra reading the Bible to lepers . But when Edmund Knox , sire of the four brothers , took the cloth , it was of a different cut . The tireless worker for his soot-stained Midlands flocks eventually became Bishop of Manchester . But he remained a gregarious and joyful man who loved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His first parsonage in rural Kibworth became ever after a touchstone of the boys ' halcyon youth . " They had their own cow in the pasture , their own rookery in the elms , and , best of all , the railway ran past the bottom of the garden , " writes Fitzgerald . " In memory it was always summer , with the victoria plums ripening on the south wall . " <P> The idyl could not last . Father was called to a grimy industrial parish in Birmingham ; their mother contracted influenza and died . But soon there was a new Mrs. Knox , an elegant lady from a landed family who encouraged the boys ' brilliance : Ronnie was reading Virgil at the age of six . It was she who decreed the boarding schools they later attended : Eton for Dilly and Ronnie , Rugby for Eddie and Wilfred . Dilly went on to Cambridge , where Lytton Strachey fell in love with him ( the compliment was not returned ) . The others went up to Oxford .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
