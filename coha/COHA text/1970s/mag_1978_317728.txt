For 15 months Burger Baron Ray Kroc , 76 , founder of the McDonald 's hamburger chain , has been bedeviled by a rumor that he donates money to the Church of Satan , a San Francisco-based cult . " The most vicious thing I 've ever heard and all lies , " sputters Kroc . Nonetheless , on many fundamentalist Christians in the Southern and Midwestern Bible Belt , the rumor has had the impact of a Big Mac attack in reverse : they are boycotting McDonald 's . So far , the protests have had a negligible effect , but just to make sure , McDonald 's Executive Doug Timberlake last week told a conference of about 75 Baptist ministers in Birmingham that the tale is untrue . <P> How did the rumor start ? Most of the burger boycotters cite a Phil Donahue TV talk show on which Kroc appeared in 1977 . Yet transcripts of the show prove that there was no discussion of religion or the devil . Says Kroc . " I do n't think holy-holy of our competition , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The devil must have done it .
