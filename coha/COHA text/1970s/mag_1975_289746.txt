After months of deliberation , President Ford seemed ready last week to face up to the threat of a deepening downturn with a more expansive economic policy . No announcements have yet been made , but it is now all but certain that the President will seek a tax cut in his State of the Union message later this month . In addition , the Administration has also apparently given up on trying to cut the budget in an attempt to quell inflation . That decision alone , tentatively taken after two days of intensive discussions between Ford and his economic advisers at the President 's vacation chalet in Vail , Colo. , could mean that the federal deficit for the fiscal year beginning next July will swell to a massive $35 billion . The fact that the Administration is even contemplating such a deficit , which would be by far the biggest in U.S. peacetime history , shows that Ford is coming around , despite all public denials , to a view that recession has replaced inflation as the U.S. 's No. 1 economic problem . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington last week , frightening new evidence of economic deterioration was surfacing . The Labor Department reported still another disturbing jump in the nation 's unemployment , from 6.5% in November to 7.1% in December . Worst off were blue-collar workers : their unemployment rate leaped 1.2% in December , to a painful 9.4% . The overall jobless level was the highest since 1961 - and one that Administration economists until recently did not expect to see before this spring . All told , 6.5 million Americans were out of work at the beginning of the new year , the largest number since 1940 . In a statement that seemed intended to prepare the country for even longer unemployment lines , White House Press Secretary Ron Nessen reported last week that from some economists , " the President has heard estimates of 8% " joblessness in the coming months . That is higher than any official Administration forecast so far . <P> Earlier , the Commerce Department disclosed that its index of leading indicators , which is designed to project future economic trends , fell 1.5% in November and 7.3% since July-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer confidence in the months ahead , a new survey by Pollster Louis Harris reported that 80% of the American people now believe the U.S. is in a recession , and 60% see it continuing through the rest of the year . To combat the worsening economic problem , President Ford at week 's end signed legislation appropriating $4.5 billion for unemployment aid and job programs . <P> Most key White House officials now agree that a moderate tax reduction of , say , $10 billion to $15 billion would get a swift and needed injection of purchasing power into the economy . There was also general agreement at Vail to pair such a tax cut with an energy-conservation package built around excise taxes on crude oil and natural gas ( see following story ) .
