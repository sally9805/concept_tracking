It is late afternoon in early spring . As the curtain rises , we see the interior of a cabin by a lake . Downstairs , a living room and a kitchen , somehow separated from one another . The living room has a fireplace , although we need not see the fire . It also has a big window overlooking the lake , which can be the " fourth wall . " The second floor , which can be indicated by risers , has two small bedrooms and a door leading to a bath . There should be steps of some kind from one level to the other , indicating a stairway . Downstairs , there are two doors : a front door , off the living room ; a back door , off the kitchen . Furnishings are comfortable and worn . Books and artifacts are tossed comfortably around . There is a bar area in the living room and a set of wind chimes in the master bedroom window . QUINCEY opens the door to the living room from the outside with a key . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here . PAT Oh , sure . It 's got four-wheel drive . Just prop the door open . ( QUINCEY does so . ) PAT I 've got the tailgate down . We can roll it in . Come on . ( QUINCEY goes back out . We hear the sound of something heavy being moved. ) p. 3 QUINCEY It weighs a ton . PAT You would n't listen . I tried to sell you something nice and light  --  an end table , a dry sink . . . . QUINCEY This is the piece she wants . She talks about it all the time . ( They appear , pushing an antique Dutch cupboard . ) PAT Lift it over the sill . QUINCEY ( Looking at the heavy object ) Lift it over the sill . PAT Come on . ( With a mighty effort , QUINCEY does so . ) QUINCEY Mother of God . PAT Good . Now we just roll it into place . QUINCEY It goes over there . PAT I know where it goes . QUINCEY Watch the rug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just push , will you ? QUINCEY Do n't scrape the floor ! p. 4 PAT You 're really uptight , are n't you ? ( She pushes the piece into place , scraping the floor . ) QUINCEY You scraped the floor ! ( She looks closely . ) Shit . PAT Spit on it . ( QUINCEY looks at her , puzzled . ) Spit on it and rub it with your finger . QUINCEY ( Does so . ) It 's a gouge . PAT It 's a scratch . She 'll never notice . You ca n't hurt these floors . ( QUINCEY continues to spit and rub . ) What does she do , beat you ? QUINCEY I 'm not even supposed to be out here . I mean , she 's never said , " Here are the keys , go out to the cabin . " PAT Are n't you here every weekend ? QUINCEY With Ellie . After all , it 's her house . PAT It 's her house . ( She looks around . ) It looks the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that piece . It 's junk . QUINCEY Why did you take it ? p. 5 PAT Because Ellie wanted it . I figured some sucker would buy it . QUINCEY Ellie says you took half the stuff in the place . PAT Well , half of it was mine . She took the lamp . I wanted that . ( She indicates a Tiffany shade . ) That 's worth something  --  a couple of hundred . QUINCEY Do n't touch that ! PAT Just looking . QUINCEY ( About scratch ) I hope she wo n't notice . PAT She will . QUINCEY You said she would n't ! PAT ( Smiles ) I lied . ( She examines shade closely . ) If I put this in the shop tomorrow morning , it 'd be sold by noon . Three hundred , easy . QUINCEY Come on , do n't touch that ! PAT Red glass is rare . Do you know why ? QUINCEY Leave it alone ! PAT They use gold to make red glass . Gold . QUINCEY Please . I never should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery . You drove a hard bargain . QUINCEY Bullshit . I paid you twice what that piece is worth . PAT That 's true . Actually , you paid much more than twice . Ellie and I found that piece of junk in an abandoned barn , four years ago . QUINCEY ( Defensively ) She loves it . She 's always saying , " I wish I had my old cupboard . " She kept her papers in it , I think . PAT Her private treasure chest . I used to love to go through it when she was out of the house . She kept little notebooks . . . . QUINCEY She still does . She has an old library table in the apartment . She keeps her notebooks in the drawer . PAT " Pat drunk seventeen days this month . Rash on my right hand getting worse . Psychological ? Order a cord of wood by the thirtieth . " A veritable font of information , huh ? QUINCEY I do n't know . I never look . PAT You should . Ellie rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stories too pat . Something 's going on . " QUINCEY I should n't have brought you out here . p. 7 PAT I still have keys . QUINCEY She changed the lock . PAT She take a Peace Bond out on me , too ? QUINCEY Ellie says you 'd steal the gold from your grandmother 's teeth . PAT ( Grins . ) There 's a lot of stuff here I 'd like to have . QUINCEY It belongs to Ellie . PAT It belongs to both of us . QUINCEY Not any more . PAT Where 'd you get those keys ? QUINCEY I took them out of her bureau drawer . PAT Before you establish your territorial prerogative , you 'd better get your own keys . ( She goes to bar . ) Want a drink ? QUINCEY We ca n't stay . PAT Why 'd you come to my shop ? QUINCEY To buy that cupboard . PAT Really ? QUINCEY It 's our anniversary . Our first anniversary . I want to give her something special . p. 8 PAT When is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUINCEY The eighteenth . PAT Amazing . Sure you wo n't join me ? ( She continues to case the house as she drinks . ) QUINCEY We 've got to go . PAT No hurry . I 've closed shop for the day . QUINCEY We should n't stay out here . PAT The eighteenth of April . Ours was June twenty-fourth . It was n't really , but I convinced Ellie it was  --  it was close enough . All my anniversaries are June twenty-fourth . It 's the only way I can remember : 6-24  --  the first three digits of my social security . ( She picks up an object . ) QUINCEY Come on . Do n't . PAT Why 'd you come to my shop ? QUINCEY ( Taking object from her ) It was the only way to get the cupboard . PAT There are a couple of cupboards just like that every weekend at the flea market . QUINCEY That cupboard is special . p. 9 PAT It looks like all the others . She would n't know the difference . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . QUINCEY You lived with her for five years . You were an important part of her life . PAT ( Satisfied ) I never should have let her buy me out . QUINCEY You made her buy you out ! PAT She would n't let me live here and I needed the money . QUINCEY She did n't have it . PAT She got it though . She could always get money if she had to . The pleasures of a Good Credit rating . ( Pause ) We laid these floors ourselves  --  and framed the windows  --  QUINCEY We 've got to go now . PAT Ellie 's mother sent us those drapes . QUINCEY It 'll be dark soon . PAT So what ? You said she wo n't be back until Sunday . QUINCEY The conference is n't over until Saturday night . She 's flying back on Sunday . PAT When we bought this place there was no insulation , no paneling , you could see the ground through the floorboards . p. 10 QUINCEY Please , Pat , let 's go . PAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ? Little Miss Step and Fetch It . Ellie loves to give orders . I never took them . ( She goes back to bar . ) Are you a teetotaler , too ? QUINCEY No . Are you going to be able to drive ? PAT My reputation precedes me . QUINCEY Ellie says you have a problem . PAT ( Pours them each a drink . ) Ellie says I 'm a drunk . She 's at a conference ? QUINCEY In Philadelphia . University department heads . PAT She go alone ? QUINCEY With the other university department heads . PAT I never knew a conference to end on a Saturday night . ( She hands QUINCEY a drink . ) Cheers . ( At window ) When did the ice go this year ? QUINCEY Sometime last week , I think . PAT We used to bet on the day . QUINCEY We were n't out here . p. 11 PAT Ever see it go ? QUINCEY No . PAT It starts melting around the edges . For a few days , it 's slush for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circle of ice that 's left in the middle of the lake gets gray , then black  --  then WHOOSH . It goes under in ten seconds . The black lake turns navy , then sky blue . And it 's spring . ( She surveys the cabin . ) You a student of Ellie 's ? QUINCEY I was  --  last year when I was in grad school . I 'm a writer . PAT Published ? QUINCEY No . PAT How do you earn a living ? QUINCEY I edit a throwaway . PAT What ? QUINCEY One of those four-page weekly papers with neighborhood news and a lot of ads that you find in your mailbox . PAT I did n't know Ellie was into seducing her students . QUINCEY She 's not . I pursued her . It was n't easy . She was n't over you . PAT Oh ? p. 12 QUINCEY I lived with your ghost for months . PAT She never answered my letters . She hung up when I called her . QUINCEY Five years is a long time . PAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get over it . She 's over it now . PAT Chilly in here . Let 's start a fire . QUINCEY Let 's go . PAT There 's wood in the crib by the fireplace . You know how to start a fire ? QUINCEY Of course . PAT Well , do it . I 'm going to take a look upstairs . QUINCEY No . PAT ( Charming ) She 'll never know . QUINCEY No . PAT For old times ' sake . QUINCEY No . PAT ( Handing her the starter wood ) Placate me . Lonely , nearing middle age , with a slight tendency to imbibe , a pitiful figure . . . ( QUINCEY laughs in spite of herself . ) Good girl . p. 13 QUINCEY Do n't take anything ! PAT ( Going upstairs ) You can frisk me when I come down . ( QUINCEY begins to make a fire . We hear a car motor , see lights flash across the kitchen . QUINCEY looks up quizzically as the key turns in the back door . ELLIE enters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're back early ! ( QUINCEY embraces ELLIE , who responds perfunctorily , then pulls nervously away . ELLIE is dismayed by QUINCEY 's unexpected presence but tries valiantly not to show it . ) QUINCEY I wanted to surprise you ! ELLIE You did . ( QUINCEY pulls ELLIE to the cupboard . ) QUINCEY With this . ( She hugs ELLIE . ) Happy First Anniversary ! ELLIE Quincey , where did you get this ? ( At the back door , MARGO appears , suitcase in hand . She stands there , unnoticed. ) p. 14 QUINCEY ( About the cupboard ) Surprise ! ELLIE Where did you get it ? QUINCEY It 's what you wanted ! ELLIE It 's just like the old one . QUINCEY It is the old one . MARGO May I come in ? ( ELLIE looks from MARGO to QUINCEY , back to MARGO . She is flustered . ) QUINCEY Hello . MARGO Hello . ELLIE ( Recovering ) This is Quincey Evans , a former student of mine . Quincey , Margo Bettis . QUINCEY Margo . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUINCEY A Memory of Autumn , The Last Question , Miller 's Breach , Afternoon in . . . MARGO Amazing . QUINCEY I took a course in you . Ellie teaches a course in you . MARGO I know . Margot Bettis a multiple-choice answer . p. 15 QUINCEY You 're always an essay . I thought you were retired ( Catches herself. )  --  a recluse . I thought you never came out in public . MARGO Only after dark . QUINCEY I mean , you never give interviews , or . . . ( Shrugs . ) I 'm getting in deeper , are n't I ? Sorry . Welcome . ( To ELLIE ) Where did you find her ? ELLIE Margo was the guest lecturer at the conference . We flew back together . MARGO She 's trying to coerce me into teaching . ELLIE A lecture series . Would n't that be a coup ? QUINCEY Terrific . You 're a kind of cult among the undergrads . MARGO It terrifies me . QUINCEY I have everything you 've ever written . ELLIE I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do my sales pitch . QUINCEY It 's like seeing a legend come to life . ELLIE I promised her a quiet day by the lake . p. 16 QUINCEY I hope we 'll have time to talk . I have a thousand questions . ELLIE I have yet to sell her on the joys of university life . QUINCEY I 'm a writer , too , you know . Fledgling but good , I think . MARGO Ellie , I 'm tired . . . and a little uncomfortable . Can I change ? ELLIE Of course . Upstairs . Excuse us , Quincey . ( ELLIE picks up MARGO 's bag , starts up the stairs . She encounters PAT on her way down . ELLIE is startled and angry at PAT 's presence . ) PAT Hi . ELLIE What are you doing here ? PAT I came with the cupboard . QUINCEY She insisted : free delivery . PAT ( To ELLIE ) Thank you ? ELLIE Thank you . Excuse us , please . ( She leads MARGO , bewildered , upstairs . MARGO stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a beautiful view of the lake . p. 17 ELLIE Yes . ( Pause . ) Put your things anywhere . MARGO But this is your room , is n't it ? ELLIE It 's the nicest room .

ELLIE It 's the least I can do . ( Pause . ) I 'm sorry . I did n't expect anyone to be here . MARGO ( Smiles . ) It 's a regular party , is n't it ? ELLIE They 'll be leaving soon . MARGO It 's all right . ELLIE It 's not all right . I promised you a quiet weekend . MARGO They 're your friends . I 'm sure they 're interesting people . ( She starts to undress . ) Are n't they ? p. 18 ELLIE ( Ignoring that ) I know how you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a big girl now . I can take care of myself . ELLIE I 'm sorry about Quincey . She 's young and exuberant . She did n't mean to embarrass you . MARGO Embarrass me ? I was flattered . Would you hand me that shirt , please ? ( Downstairs . ) PAT ( To QUINCEY ) Well , well . Are n't you glad we stuck around ? QUINCEY Cool it . That 's business . PAT I 'll say . QUINCEY Do n't you know who she is ? PAT I heard your eulogy . QUINCEY She 's like a myth . I 've never seen a picture of her . I 've read everything she 's ever written , but I never knew what she looked like before . PAT You wo n't forget . QUINCEY Ellie has many business associates . That 's what this is . I know Ellie . PAT I guess I do n't . I thought she was true-blue-lou. p. 19 QUINCEY She is . ( Upstairs , ELLIE is uncomfortable watching MARGO . ) ELLIE They wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry . I 'll go downstairs and take care of it . ( Pause . ) Are you all right ? MARGO I 'm fine . Just fine . ( ELLIE descends the stairs as PAT is pouring another drink . ) ELLIE Quincey ? Thank you . ( She hugs QUINCEY warmly . ) I 'm sorry I was abrupt  --  I was just stunned to find you here . QUINCEY It 's all right . ELLIE It was an opportunity that I could n't pass up , honey . Every university in the country has tried to get Margo on faculty . No one 's ever succeeded . We seemed to hit it off at the conference . . . . Honey , she does n't know . . . . I mean , I have n't said anything . So , play it cool ? QUINCEY I hate doing that . ELLIE Please ? QUINCEY It 's important to you , is n't it ? p. 20 PAT ( Entering their area ) So , how are you , Ellie ? ELLIE Fine , Pat . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . ELLIE So do you . PAT The house looks good . ELLIE It 's a nice house . PAT It always was , I miss it . ELLIE It 's been good seeing you , Pat . I appreciate your bringing the cupboard out . You do n't mind giving Quincey a ride back to town , do you ? PAT ( Pause . ) I see . ELLIE I have work to do . QUINCEY I 'd like to stay , Ellie . I 'd like to talk to her . ELLIE If I get her to sign a contract , you 'll have lots of chances to talk to her . ( Pause . ) It would n't look good , honey . I 'm sorry , Quincey . ( PAT grins . MARGO comes down the stairs , sloppy , comfortable. ) p. 21 MARGO This is the real person . That other lady is a sham . PAT Hi . ELLIE Oh . Margo , this is Pat Leonard . PAT I 've read your work . MARGO And ? PAT You 're good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't you ? QUINCEY An admirer . Fan sounds  --  childish . PAT You must be used to adulation . MARGO Not at all . I do n't see many people . That 's one of the things that distresses me about Ellie 's idea . QUINCEY Lecturing . MARGO It terrifies me . All those people ! QUINCEY Adoring you . MARGO Why ? For what ? QUINCEY For being one of the best writers in the world . MARGO She 's tenacious . PAT Ellie can testify to that . p. 22 ELLIE I do n't know what you 're talking about . PAT Quincey told me about your first meeting . MARGO Oh ? ( Pause . ) Well ? QUINCEY It 's not a very interesting story . I want to talk to you . If I could have picked any writer in the world to interview , it would have been you : and here you are . MARGO I 'm overwhelmed . I 'm also hungry . How about some supper ? ELLIE Pat and Quincey have to get back to town . MARGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this marvelous little country store . . . . PAT O'Brien 's . MARGO You know it ? PAT Well . MARGO And I 'm cooking . ELLIE No . MARGO Yes . Does that tempt you ? QUINCEY Ellie . . . PAT We 'd love to stay . MARGO Good ! p. 23 QUINCEY We 'll leave right after supper . MARGO You ( To ELLIE ) go upstairs and change . Get comfortable . You two ( To PAT and QUINCEY ) bring in the groceries . ( ELLIE , reluctantly , starts for stairs . ) Go on ! ( PAT grins and goes for the groceries . QUINCEY tries to elicit some response from ELLIE , but ELLIE goes upstairs . To QUINCEY ) I neglected to mention that I have n't cooked since Thanksgiving three years ago when my sister was having her fifth baby . QUINCEY How do you eat ? MARGO I live in a hotel . There 's a restaurant downstairs . QUINCEY That must be expensive . MARGO Money buys time . And time is something a writer never has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You live alone ? MARGO Yes . QUINCEY I do n't think I 'll ever want to live alone . MARGO You never have ? QUINCEY No . My family , then college , then  --  roommates. p. 24 MARGO You should try it alone . Everyone should . Builds an independent person . QUINCEY I always want to have a lover . MARGO Just do n't get married and have babies . It drains your creative juices . QUINCEY That is n't exactly what I had in mind . MARGO You have a boyfriend ? QUINCEY Well , I have had a boyfriend . A lot of them , as a matter of fact . MARGO I should think so . You 're a nice-looking girl . ( PAT enters with groceries . ) PAT You 're not doing your share , Quincey , friend . QUINCEY Oh . Sorry . I 'll get the rest . PAT That 's it . MARGO Do n't stand there like Samson . Those must be heavy . Put them down . ( PAT does . ) I hope there 's no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the bag . ) We 're having spaghetti . Fan  --  admirer  --  want to help ? QUINCEY Sure . p. 25 PAT You never got that fire going , did you ? ( Without waiting for an answer , PAT heads to the fireplace . ELLIE comes down the stairs . ) ELLIE ( To kitchen ) Everything under control ? MARGO Fine . The fan  --  QUINCEY Admirer . MARGO  --  is helping . ELLIE What can I do ? MARGO Nothing . Out of the kitchen ! Too many cooks . . . ELLIE You 're sure ? If you need me . . . ( As ELLIE enters living room : ) PAT I need you . Give me some newspapers off that pile . ELLIE ( Doing so ) You always had a talent for that . PAT You have n't had a fire since . ELLIE Do n't flatter yourself . I 've managed . PAT You still think I 'm a scoundrel , do n't you ? ELLIE Are n't you ? p. 26 PAT I never thought so . ELLIE Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAT I did n't mean to be . ELLIE It 's over , let 's forget it . Okay ? PAT It 's not over . The ice sank last week . ELLIE I did n't see it . PAT It 's going to be spring . ELLIE It looks like snow to me . PAT All dead things come to life . ELLIE No . It looks like snow . PAT I 'm sorry . You never gave me a chance to say I 'm sorry . You would n't see me , talk to me . You never gave us a chance . ELLIE ( Pause . ) Did you give Cassie a chance ? PAT I never loved her . ELLIE You made love to her  --  drunk . You wrapped her in a car around a walnut tree and you walked away . PAT It was an accident . ELLIE She was my friend . p. 27 PAT You hated her . ELLIE I hated her for having for affair with you , for making a fool out of me , for lying to me . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellie . It never meant anything . ELLIE Cassie 's dead , Pat . That means something . PAT It was an accident . ELLIE Everything 's an accident . It 's an accident you drink too much . It 's an accident you fall into bed with the nearest available woman . It 's an accident that they all fall in love with you , even when you do n't want them . Cassie is dead and you say , it was an accident . PAT Do n't you think I feel anything ? ELLIE I do n't know . PAT I did n't want to kill anybody . I never wanted to hurt anybody . I 'm sorry Cassie 's dead . I 'm sorry , sorry , sorry , I 've said it a million times , asleep and awake . I know there 's no price on a human life but I 've paid , Ellie , I 've paid . The court wiped out my trust fund ; my father , the compassionate bastard , wiped me out of his will . I lost my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ELLIE I was just someone to come home to between binges , between affairs . Not much of a loss , Pat . p. 28 PAT I loved you . ELLIE ( Pause . ) I loved you . PAT What happened to us ? ELLIE Maybe five years is too long . PAT I wanted to be with you for a lifetime . I had a dream : two crochety old ladies rocking on that front porch , waiting for the ice to go . ( Pause . ) She 's not enough for you , Ellie . You need more than that . ELLIE She 's bright and honest  --  and she loves me . PAT She 's there when you come home . Faithful and comfortable . Only a year and you 're bored to death . ELLIE That 's not true . PAT Then why the house guest ? ELLIE The house guest is here on business . I do n't know anything about her  --  personal preferences . PAT But you 've got a feeling , have n't you ? ( QUINCEY enters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garlic press ? PAT ( Smartly ) Bottom drawer on the left , under the sink . p. 29 QUINCEY Ellie ? ELLIE That 's right . ( QUINCEY exits . ) PAT Little Miss Step and Fetch It . But cute . I 'll admit that . Cute . ELLIE You 're jealous . PAT Not of her . ELLIE She 's good for me . PAT She worships you . Good for your ego . ELLIE You wo n't give up , will you ? PAT She 's no challenge . That 's what makes the knees tremble and the wind chimes ring : the challenge . Without it , boredom . ELLIE If challenge means sitting up night after night wondering in whose bed you 'll find your drunken lover , I 've had enough challenge for a lifetime , thanks . ( From the kitchen , MARGO 's voice . ) MARGO All right , you two . I need some help ! PAT ( To ELLIE ) Obviously , you have n't . ( To MARGO ) Coming ! ( They go into the kitchen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make magnificent sauce . PAT She does . MARGO ( To PAT ) And what are you good at ? PAT ( Grinning ) My specialty is  --  mixing drinks . ELLIE ( Warning ) Pat . . . MARGO Mine is drinking them . ( To ELLIE , about the kitchen ) It 's all yours . Let me know when you 're ready for the spaghetti to go in . ( PAT and MARGO go into the living room , ELLIE looking worriedly after them . ) QUINCEY ( To ELLIE ) Hi . I love you . I missed you . ( ELLIE smiles nervously , proceeds to make sauce . QUINCEY presses garlic , cuts bread , etc . In the living room : ) MARGO Straight up . A shot glass is fine . PAT I can tell you 're my kind of woman . ( In the kitchen : ) p. 31 QUINCEY I 'm jealous . ELLIE Do n't be silly . I do n't even know the woman . QUINCEY Not her . Pat . ELLIE I was crazy for five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're still in love with her . ELLIE ( Ignoring that ) She 's getting drunk , Quincey . You 've got to get her out of here right after supper . Can you drive that truck of hers ? QUINCEY I suppose so . ELLIE She 's uncontrollable when she 's drunk . She talks too much . QUINCEY That could be embarrassing . ELLIE And she 'll try to seduce anyone  --  if she thinks it 'll hurt me . QUINCEY Do n't worry . I would n't fall for that . ( In the living room : ) MARGO ( At window ) It looks like snow . PAT No way . It 's too late in the season . MARGO It 's a snow sky . ( She accepts drink . ) Thank you . So , exactly who are you ? p. 32 PAT ( Looking at sky ) A friend . MARGO Oh ? PAT An ex-friend . MARGO You do n't know which ? PAT Like the weather up here , it could change any minute . MARGO You 're from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this house . MARGO Oh . Ellie bought it from you ? PAT Partly . MARGO What do you do ? PAT I restore old things . Antiques . MARGO How about old writers ? PAT I could open a department . ( Pause . ) You 're not old . MARGO No ? I had my success so early . I peaked at twenty-five  --  and there are too many years left after that . Girl Genius goes dry . PAT You 're still writing . MARGO Trying . Strange . I had so much to say when I was twenty-five . p. 33 PAT Does a writer write from imagination or experience ? MARGO Experience first . That triggers the imagination . PAT And you 're short on experience ? MARGO ( Pause . ) Interesting . PAT Are you ? MARGO Yes . Ten years ago I closed the door . I 'd had as much experience as I could bear . Enough to last , I thought . ( PAT pours another drink , looks questioningly at MARGO . ) Not yet . But meeting Ellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of life , of ideas . I never thought of teaching . PAT Ellie loves it . MARGO It frightens me . PAT It 's a challenge . MARGO Ellie makes me feel that I can do it . She makes me feel alive again  --  brave . PAT I see . MARGO ( Quickly , to kitchen ) How are you doing in there ? ( From kitchen : ) p. 34 ELLIE Under way . ( To QUINCEY ) Go in the living room , honey . Relax . QUINCEY I 'd rather stay with you . ELLIE I 'd rather you kept an eye on Pat . QUINCEY ( Reluctantly ) Oh . ( She gives ELLIE a kiss as she goes into the living room . ELLIE gives her a warning look . ) Sorry . Just doing what comes naturally . ( She goes into the living room . ) MARGO Whatever it is , it smells good . QUINCEY It 'll be good . Ellie 's a super cook . PAT ( To QUINCEY ) You think everybody 's just wonderful , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARGO ( Quickly ) I 'm sure Ellie cooks as well as she does everything else . PAT We 're obviously all aware of Ellie 's talents . QUINCEY ( Confused , quickly ) Tell me about the conference . p. 35 MARGO The conference ? QUINCEY In Philadelphia . MARGO Oh . Well , I gave a timid little lecture and Ellie led the applause . QUINCEY Where did you stay ? MARGO The Concord . QUINCEY So did Ellie . MARGO Yes . Everyone at the conference stayed at the Concord . It 's a lovely old hotel . QUINCEY I 've never been there . I 've never been to a conference . PAT You have n't missed a thing . MARGO You meet , have assemblies , lectures . . . . QUINCEY Day and night ? MARGO Days mostly . There was a terrible dinner the first night  --  a command performance . Shoeleather steaks , frozen vegetables and speakers . Deadly . Everyone glued themselves to the bar afterward , I 'm told . The turnout at the early session the next morning must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARGO We did n't stay . We spent the evening talking . p. 36 QUINCEY In your room ? MARGO In hers . ( To PAT ) Would you freshen this ? QUINCEY Me , too . PAT ( To QUINCEY ) Oh . Sorry . ( She starts to mix drink . ) We need ice . I 'll get it . ( She goes to kitchen . ) ELLIE ( To PAT ) Will you take it easy ? PAT Nag , nag . I 'm just being the genial host . ELLIE  --  ess . PAT ( Prissy ) Hostess . ELLIE The trouble with you is you do n't like women . PAT Are you kidding ? ELLIE You do n't . Not really . You do n't like yourself and you do n't like other women . PAT Stop philosophizing and keep cooking . ( She slaps ELLIE on the ass and exits to living room with ice . ) MARGO I know that I 'd enjoy working with Ellie . p. 37 PAT ( Entering ) Ice , coming up . ( In the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the living room . ) MARGO But I 'm nervous about making a commitment  --  to teaching . ELLIE ( Entering ) The sauce is simmering . You can put on the water for the spaghetti . MARGO ( Charmingly to QUINCEY ) Would you ? ELLIE ( Before QUINCEY can answer ) Thanks , honey . ( QUINCEY , irritated , goes to kitchen . ) PAT We were having a fascinating conversation : how you and Margo discovered one another across a crowded room in Philadelphia . MARGO That 's not quite what I said . PAT And changed the course of one another 's lives . ELLIE Pat ! MARGO Of my life . I said that meeting you was meaningful to me . ( An awkward pause . ) And it might well change the course of my life . ( Laughs . ) It 's a course that could use some changing , believe me. p. 38 PAT ( To ELLIE ) Your boundless enthusiasm and zest for challenge has sparked new life , presented new horizons . ELLIE I 've always admired Margo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELLIE Will you shut up ? ( MARGO and ELLIE smile at each other . ) PAT ( In frustration ) Where 's the poker . I want to stoke the fire . ELLIE ( Crossing to the window ) I do n't know . In the crib . Look for it . MARGO Pat used to live here , she was telling me . ELLIE She was ? PAT We used to live here together . MARGO I thought perhaps something like that . ( ELLIE looks at her quickly . ) You 're snippy with each other . You must know each other very well . PAT Perceptive . MARGO It goes with being a writer . Occupational handicap  --  or advantage . Depends on your point of view . p. 39 PAT She lives with Quincey now . ( ELLIE looks sharply at PAT . ) MARGO Oh . ELLIE ( Quickly ) We share an apartment near the university . Rents are very high . MARGO And you . Do you have a roommate , Pat ? PAT Sometimes . And sometimes not . MARGO I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had roommates though . ( ELLIE and PAT look with interest . ) I remember my college roommate . ( She laughs . ) PAT I never had a college roommate . Ellie did . MARGO Mine had peroxide hair . Frizzy . She lost her virginity in the entrance hall , after hours , her freshman year . Bled all over the bathroom . Put me in a state of terror : I was sure that going to bed with a man was tantamount to a seige of battle . PAT Was n't it ? ( MARGO just smiles . ) ELLIE My college roommate was beautiful . The most beautiful girl on campus . The jocks used to line up in the lounge , waiting for her . She gave them all a hard time . p. 40 PAT Perfect Peggy . ( To MARGO ) You 'll excuse my attitude but I 've heard this story a thousand times . MARGO You 're about to hear it again . I 'm interested . ELLIE No . ( Pause . ) She was just perfect , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELLIE ( Taken aback ) Yes . MARGO It 's nice to remember friends we 've loved . What happened to her ? PAT Perfect Peggy panicked . She got married . MARGO That 's nice . Do you hear from her ? ELLIE Christmas cards , now and then . MARGO You should look her up . It 's fun to see how people change . ELLIE I 'd rather remember her . PAT You can control your memories . You do n't have to remember that she had a large wart on the back of her ear . . . . ELLIE She did n't have any warts ! p. 41 PAT Or she picked her nose . ELLIE Pat ! PAT Or she drank a little too much . ( She pours herself another drink . ) ELLIE Stop it . PAT Or she fooled around . . . . ( She offers MARGO a drink . MARGO refuses . ) You can shine memories up real nice . But live people  --  they 're a little harder to control . ELLIE ( Quickly ) I wrote to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her about the cabin and invited her to bring her family up some weekend . PAT No kidding ? ELLIE I do n't know why I did that . I was  --  PAT Bored . ( ELLIE looks sharply at PAT . ) I 'd like to meet Perfect Peggy . ELLIE I hope that can be avoided . ( QUINCEY enters , pours another drink . ) How 's it going , Quincey ? ( QUINCEY does n't respond . ) Take it easy . You 're not a drinker . ( QUINCEY slugs it . ) Are you all right ? p. 42 QUINCEY I think I 'm not going to feel so good . ELLIE Go upstairs and lie down . QUINCEY Not on your life . MARGO We were talking about college roommates . Did you have a college roommate , Quincey ? PAT Yeah . The professor . QUINCEY I only lived in the dorm six months . It was n't my style . I could n't feel free there . It 's an up-tight school . ( To ELLIE ) Sorry , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? PAT It means closed up tight , constipated . ELLIE Pat ! MARGO I know what the word means . I have n't been dead  --  just cloistered . QUINCEY For instance : ( A pause . She does n't know whether to go ahead or not . ) One person , a sophomore , tried to form a Gay Lib group . . . . MARGO Gay Lib ? ( To PAT ) I know what it means . PAT I figured you did . p. 43 MARGO ( To QUINCEY ) And ? QUINCEY They kicked her out of the dorm . MARGO Who did ? QUINCEY The administration . The rest of the kids , we rallied and picketed and the trustees had a hearing . They let her stay in school  --  if she lived off campus . She could n't live in the dorm . ELLIE Quincey . . . QUINCEY It 's true , is n't it ? ELLIE It was four years ago . The administration has changed . There are some radical groups on campus now . QUINCEY The faculty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a professed Communist on the staff . That 's a far cry from my college days . QUINCEY There may be a two-headed donkey , too , but there sure as hell are n't any homosexuals ! ELLIE It 's a conservative school . This is a conservative state . QUINCEY Somebody has to make change happen . Somebody who believes in the goodness of themselves , of what they are . PAT So do it . p. 44 QUINCEY ( Frantically ) I ca n't . I want to be honest and free and proud . . . Everything I do reflects on Ellie . ELLIE Quincey , that 's enough . ( QUINCEY turns and runs upstairs to the bedroom . ) She 's not used to drinking . MARGO She seems to be really upset . ELLIE I 'll go . ( Follows QUINCEY upstairs . ) MARGO ( To PAT ) Well . I 'm not sure I know what all that was about . PAT I expect you do . MARGO Young people are all crusaders these days . PAT Come on , Margo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know nothing about birthing babies " act . MARGO I do n't know what you 're talking about . ( Rises . ) I 'd better check on the spaghetti . I hope Quincey will feel like eating . I made enough for six people . ( She passes the window . ) See ? I told you it looked like snow . PAT ( Looking out window ) Well , I 'll be damned . ( MARGO goes to kitchen , leaving PAT in living room . PAT pours another drink . Upstairs : ) p. 45 ELLIE Quincey . . . QUINCEY Why 'd you put her in our room ? ELLIE It 's the nicest room . She 's a special guest . QUINCEY You really want to impress her , do n't you ? ELLIE I did . QUINCEY I 'm sorry . I could n't help it . I did n't say anything about you . ELLIE If she does n't know , she 's retarded . QUINCEY What difference does it make ? She may be , herself . If she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want the world to know it . ELLIE I could lose my job . QUINCEY Oh , Ellie . ELLIE It makes people uncomfortable . They do n't understand . QUINCEY It 's time we made them understand . ELLIE Quincey , I know you 're right . QUINCEY Then , why wo n't you do something about it ? Are n't you proud ? Do n't you like yourself ? ELLIE I like being a woman . QUINCEY A woman who loves other women . p. 46 ELLIE Quincey , listen to me ! When I was your age , " lesbian " was a dictionary word used only to frighten teen-age girls and parents . Mothers fainted , fathers became violent , landlords evicted you , and nobody would hire you . A lesbian was like a vampire : she looked in the mirror and there was no reflection . QUINCEY You 're scared . ELLIE Of course I 'm scared . I do n't want to be different . I do n't want people pointing fingers at me , misguided altruists feeling sorry for me . QUINCEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a figurehead . ELLIE I do n't have the courage to be a figurehead , Quincey . I 'm sorry . ( She starts to leave . ) QUINCEY Ellie ? I hope I did n't screw things up for you . I do n't want to hurt you . I love you . I love you , love you , love you . ( ELLIE holds her . ) It 's just that I 'm so fucking tired of living in a closet ! ELLIE ( Pause . ) Are you going to be all right ? QUINCEY As long as I 'm here . ELLIE Think you can come downstairs ? p. 47 QUINCEY Give me a minute . ( ELLIE releases her , starts to leave . ) I 'm sorry . ELLIE So am I. QUINCEY Someday . ELLIE I hope so . ( She comes down the stairs , into the kitchen . To MARGO ) She 's all right . Just a little too much to drink . She 'll be down for supper . MARGO Good . ELLIE Can I help ? MARGO In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ELLIE It 's snowing . PAT Hard and fast . So I was wrong . I 'm not often wrong . ELLIE You 'd better go right after supper , Pat . I do n't want you marooned here all night . PAT Do n't worry . I 've got four-wheel drive . Is the kid all right ? ELLIE She 's not a kid . PAT Sorry . Is the young woman all right ? ELLIE She 'll be fine . She does n't have your tolerance for alcohol . p. 48 PAT She does n't have my experience . ELLIE Thank God . PAT You 're not in love with her . ELLIE I love her . PAT It 's not the same thing . ELLIE It 's a lot more reliable . PAT What are you going to do , bounce her off your knee when you hear the wind chimes again ? Dump her ? ELLIE No . I 'm not going to hurt her . PAT You wo n't be able to help yourself . ( Pause . ) I 'd rather you stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance then . ELLIE Stop it . PAT That one ( Indicating kitchen ) is real competition . I do n't want to see that happen . ELLIE You do n't have anything to do with it . PAT Do n't I ? ( From the kitchen : ) MARGO Okay , set the table ! ( ELLIE begins to do so , PAT pours another drink in the living room . QUINCEY comes down the stairs , PAT sees her , motions her in. ) p. 49 PAT How 're you feeling ? QUINCEY Better . PAT This stuff is poison . You got to work up a tolerance , takes years . QUINCEY You ought to know . PAT What are you going to do ? QUINCEY About what ? PAT Your celebrity rival in there . QUINCEY She 's no rival . PAT I would n't jump to that conclusion . QUINCEY Ellie says you 're a troublemaker . PAT Do you believe everything Ellie says ? QUINCEY Most of it . She 's as honest as she can be . She would n't hurt me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I know a game that will nip that in the bud . QUINCEY No games . I do n't play games . PAT It 's your funeral . QUINCEY ( Pause . ) What is the game ? PAT I 'll come on to you , see . She 'll get jealous . . . p. 50 QUINCEY No . PAT It 'll work . QUINCEY No . PAT Could n't hurt . QUINCEY No . I wo n't play games with Ellie . ( ELLIE enters . ) PAT We 're getting to know each other . ELLIE How about earning your supper ? QUINCEY I 'll get the flatware . PAT Want another drink first , Quincey ? ELLIE She 's had enough . PAT Oh , listen to Mommy . QUINCEY I do n't want another drink . ELLIE ( At window ) It 's really coming down . ( PAT is at bar . ) PAT A late snow . Something like a last chance , would n't you say ? ( MARGO enters . ) MARGO What was that ? PAT A late snow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause . ) I suppose so . ( Car lights outside , a horn . ) ELLIE What 's that ? QUINCEY ( At back door ) A car outside . MARGO A stranded motorist , probably . The roads must be slippery . ( A voice calls , " Ellie ! " ) ELLIE ( At door ) Who is it ? VOICE ( Offstage ) Ellie , I 've been driving for hours . I thought I 'd never find you . I know I should have called but I just could n't . I hope you do n't mind . ELLIE Peggy ! ( PEGGY 's at the door . ) Peggy ! ( PEGGY pours into ELLIE 's arms . ) PEGGY I 'm so glad to see you . I thought I was going to slide into a ditch , it 's like driving on glass and my snow tires are old , they hardly have any tread . . . . ELLIE You look just the same . PEGGY You 're lying . I look older . p. 52 ELLIE A year or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just terrible of me to come barging in ? ELLIE No . Of course not . PEGGY I did n't have time to call . I walked out on Jim again . The second time this year . I just got in the car , I did n't know where I was going , then I remembered your letter was in my pocketbook , so I followed the directions and here I am . The directions were very good , I usually get lost a dozen times . ELLIE Come in . PEGGY Oh , you 've got company . How stupid of me . I should have called , should n't I ? ELLIE This is Pat , Quincey , Margo , Peggy . PAT Perfect Peggy . What do you know . PEGGY What ? PAT Ellie used to talk about you  --  a lot . I called you Perfect Peggy . ( Pause . ) Forget it . MARGO Nice to meet you . QUINCEY Hi . MARGO Fortunately , we have plenty of food . Join us. p. 53 ELLIE There 's a guest bedroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? PEGGY I managed to get it down the stairs , I guess I can get it up . ELLIE Make yourself comfortable , I 'll be right up . ( PEGGY goes up the stairs . To QUINCEY , PAT , MARGO ) Can you handle everything down here ? PAT I do n't know . It 's getting damned complicated . MARGO Go ahead . Five minutes till supper . ELLIE I 'm sorry about all this , Margo . MARGO One has to learn to roll with the punches . I 'm rather enjoying it ; it 's quite educational . ELLIE I 'll figure something out . MARGO I 'm sure you will . ( MARGO smiles as ELLIE mounts the stairs . PAT is at the window with QUINCEY . ) PAT The trouble with a late snow is  --  it 's unexpected and messy as hell . CURTAIN @x MARGO is lying down in the living room , reading . Outside the noise of grinding gears and an occasional " Push ! " " Rock it ! " from PAT and QUINCEY . ELLIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is dark outside . PEGGY . . . The first three or four years were good , Ellie . I had the kids , we bought the house , we had dreams . Jimmy was the bright young man in college , you remember . ELLIE I remember . " Most likely to succeed . " Most popular girl weds boy " most likely . " PEGGY Well , the world is full of colleges and every year thousands of young men , all of them " most likely , " descend on the corporate world , swarming towards offices labeled " Executive Vice-President " like salmon dashing for the mating grounds . Head of Northeastern Sales is as far as Jimmy got . ELLIE That sounds impressive . PEGGY Not to Jimmy . It 's a middle-management job . Nobody gets promoted from there . Jimmy says it 's the slot reserved for failures . Eight years ago , he quit . He opened his own business . We borrowed from his folks and my folks and we took the kids ' tuition money we 'd saved  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware ? PEGGY You know , fancy shelves , early American doorknobs , drawer pulls , drop latches , indirect lighting systems , self-stick bulletin boards , velvet contact paper . ELLIE Luxury hardware . PEGGY Jimmy has always been farsighted . The time was ripe . So many people living in apartments now , doing their own decorating . ELLIE Luxury hardware . PEGGY Listen , it was a good idea . Unfortunately , the manager of Woolworth 's dime store across the street was also farsighted and sold the same merchandise for 8 percent less . Jimmy went back to Hamilton Die , Head of Northeastern Sales . He thinks of himself as a failure . ELLIE And you ? PEGGY ( Not responding ) I 've been working at a thrift shop downtown , four days a week . Lois is a senior this year . She wants to go to Bard but it 's out of the question . They only give half scholarships . If she works this summer , between her salary and mine , we 'll just be able to get her through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mulhaven Drive with a maid and a garden out back . In the driveway . . . p. 56 PEGGY ( Joining in the litany ) . . . the circular driveway . . . ELLIE . . . lined with towering elms . . . PEGGY . . . and paved with . . . ELLIE Gold . PEGGY No . Slate . ELLIE You 'd sit in the late afternoon , your exquisite straw hat casting perfect shadows on your perfect features . . . . PEGGY . . . sipping tall , cool drinks . . . ELLIE . . . served on a silver tray , while planning that evening 's formal dinner for the town dignitaries . . . PEGGY . . . and considering how someone in my position could help the less fortunate . ELLIE The fairy princess . PEGGY ( Laughing ) No . " Most popular girl weds boy most likely . " I never got my circular drive : we have a carport  --  and a cleaning woman once a week . ELLIE Dreams rarely comes true . PEGGY Yours did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 ELLIE You thought it was a dull , old-maid thing to do . PEGGY And to live in a funky apartment with mobiles and wall hangings . ELLIE I do . PEGGY And to have a funny shack somewhere to get away from it all . ELLIE This is it . PEGGY Your dreams came true . ELLIE Not wholly . I wanted someone to share it with , someone to be a part of it , from the beginning to the end . I always wanted that . PEGGY Well , you ca n't have everything . You got the most important part . ELLIE Did I ? PEGGY And you did it yourself . You did n't depend on someone else . I could never have done that . ELLIE Of course you could . PEGGY No . I could never have done that . ( She laughs . ) The curse of a fairy princess . ELLIE Remember how we used to go over the want ads on Sunday mornings . You were going to be a buyer for the fanciest store in town and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house with high ceilings and hanging plants  --  p. 58 PEGGY And mobiles and wall hangings ? No , not me . That was you . I never wanted that . ELLIE Sometimes you did . PEGGY Never . ELLIE But the circular drive with the towering elms won out . PEGGY Actually , it 's a development . ELLIE With a carport . PEGGY Yes . But it 's my life . Mine and Jimmy 's . ELLIE Why did you leave ? PEGGY Eddie 's at military school . Jim 's father pays the tuition . " Make a man out of him . " Frankly , I think it 's making a jerk out of him . He 's so damned disciplined , he does n't know how to be a kid . Twelve years old and he gives orders like a five-star general . He wo n't stop at Head of Northeastern Sales . ELLIE Why did you leave , Peggy ? PEGGY When a man thinks he 's failed in business , he has to succeed somewhere . His job takes him on the road a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never said a word about it , it 's been going on for years . Oh , I have n't been lonely . I have a friend , Wanda . She works with me at the thrift shop . We go out to dinner and to the movies together . I 've found letters from his girl friends and phone numbers in his wallet . He has n't been home for a birthday or anniversary in years but I never accused him . I never accused him . How dare he accuse me ! p. 59 ELLIE Of having an affair ? PEGGY How dare he ? ELLIE Have you ? PEGGY Why should he care if I did ? ELLIE Did you ? PEGGY He says , if you 've thought about it , it 's the same as doing it . I have n't done it ! ELLIE You obviously want to . PEGGY Wanda thinks I should leave him . ELLIE What do you think ? PEGGY I think he 's a son of a bitch . I 've put most of my life into this marriage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . I do n't know . I do n't know what I want . I guess that 's why I came here . You 're the only person I know who 'll understand . You and Wanda . ELLIE ( Meaningfully ) Wanda ? PEGGY You sound like Jim ! Wanda is my friend , like you were my friend . I love her , like I loved you . ELLIE We loved each other  --  a step beyond friendship . PEGGY We were friends . Best friends . I never felt so close to anyone , until Wanda . p. 60 ELLIE What you 're feeling is n't friendship , Peggy . What we felt together was n't friendship . PEGGY Of course it was ! We loved each other . ELLIE We were in love with each other . PEGGY I 'm not like that . ELLIE We made love . PEGGY That 's not true ! ELLIE Not often , we were both too scared . But we did make love . After the Saint Patrick 's Party , New Year 's Eve in New Hampshire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember it because it was new and pure and perfect . It was always exciting , to the very end it was exciting . It was perfect . PEGGY You were going with Danny Rogers and I was going with Morton Tate  --  until the end of our senior year when I met Jim . We were good friends , Ellie . That 's all . ( Pause . ) Danny Rogers is an assemblyman now . They say he 's going to run for Congress . You missed a good bet . He married a mouse . ( The door opens and QUINCEY and PAT enter , coats drenched from the snow . ) QUINCEY No luck . p. 61 PAT We pushed and rocked and spun . It 's already four inches and icing up . Nobody 's going anywhere tonight . PEGGY Too bad Jim 's not here . He could get it out . ELLIE You may not believe that this drunken women is an ace mechanic , but she is . If Pat ca n't move that car , nobody can . PEGGY I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some things . QUINCEY I do n't believe I heard that . PAT ( Flirting with PEGGY ) She does n't have a wart behind her ear . Has she been picking her nose ? PEGGY What ? ELLIE Never mind . Take off that wet coat , Quincey . PAT ( To QUINCEY ) Mind Mama . ( To PEGGY ) Want a drink ? PEGGY Why not ? PAT Follow me . ( They go into living room . ) MARGO And ? PAT Ca n't budge it . Want a drink ? p. 62 MARGO No , thanks . I 've got coffee . PAT Party pooper . Now , what do you want , Perfect Peggy ? PEGGY An after-dinner drink would be fine . PAT Ugh . PEGGY Creme de cocoa . PAT Really ? PEGGY I like it . PAT I 'll see if there 's some in the kitchen . ( Goes to kitchen . ) PEGGY Excuse me . I hope you wo n't think I 'm rude but . . . ( MARGO looks up. ) are you one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them . MARGO One of what ? PEGGY Do you like men ? MARGO Some men . PEGGY Do you sleep with them ? MARGO Men ? PEGGY Yes . MARGO I 've probably slept with more men than you 've ever met. p. 63 PEGGY Oh , good . It looks like we 're all going to have to stay over . You and I can share a room . PAT ( Entering with bottle ) That 's the first proposition of the night . PEGGY ( About bottle , quickly ) That looks fine . That 's a very good brand . PAT Nothing but the best , baby . Nothing but the best . ( In the kitchen : ) QUINCEY Are you all right ? ELLIE I 'm worried . QUINCEY About Pat ? ELLIE Who 's going to be the victim . It 's Pat 's pattern . Step One : Seduce somebody . Step Two : Hurt somebody else by doing it . It 's called " See how much everybody loves me ? Anybody who loves me deserves to be punished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . ELLIE A game ? QUINCEY To pretend I was attracted to her , to Pat . It was supposed to make you pay attention to me . ELLIE ( Smiling ) I know that game . It 's designed not to make me pay attention to you  --  but to her . p. 64 QUINCEY I do n't understand . ELLIE You 're too honest . I hope you never understand . QUINCEY Something 's happening and I 'm frightened . ( In the living room . ) PEGGY Are you really an auto mechanic ? PAT Nope . I 'm an antique dealer . A multifaceted human being . PEGGY I love antiques . Do you do appraisals ? PAT Sure . Where do you live ? PEGGY Oh , I 'm too far . About seventy miles . PAT I travel . PEGGY Maybe you could recommend someone in my area . PAT You left your husband , huh ? PEGGY I need some time to think things over . PAT You 're bored . PEGGY I do n't think so . PAT You 're bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . PAT It happens to everybody . How long have you been bored ? p. 65 PEGGY ( Laughs . ) About ten years . PAT When the kids started school . PEGGY How do you know ? PAT I 've heard it before . I 've known a few disgruntled wives . PEGGY I 'm not just a disgruntled wife . There 's a lot more to it . PAT There always is . MARGO ( Irritated , rises . ) Excuse me . ( She goes upstairs , into the bathroom . ) PAT Tell me about you and Ellie . PEGGY We were good friends . PAT She says you were the most beautiful girl in the school . PEGGY My daughter looks just like me . She 's beautiful . ( Smiles . ) Things change . PAT You 're probably more beautiful now . PEGGY You are drunk . PAT I think women get better with age . Like good wine . . . PEGGY Ellie got prettier . She was gawky in college . I never went through that gawky stage . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She really loved you . PEGGY We were good friends . PAT Romeo and Juliet , Damon and Pythias , Jonathan and David , Gertrude and Alice . . . PEGGY We were good friends . PAT Nobody could ever live up to you . PEGGY No . We were friends . Not that I 'm passing judgment on your lifestyle , but we were just friends . PAT That 's all . PEGGY That 's all . PAT Another creme de cocoa ? ( In the kitchen : ) QUINCEY Let 's go to bed . Let 's just go upstairs and go to bed and let them all do whatever it is that they 're going to do . ELLIE I ca n't . When Pat is drunk , she not only plays her games  --  she 's also likely to set the house on fire , turn on the gas without lighting it , leave the grate off the fireplace , fall through the storm door . QUINCEY I do n't understand why you stayed with her for five years . ELLIE It was n't always like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we were first together , she hardly drank at all . We were so happy and so much in love  --  and when the drinking started again , I knew what it could be like , what we could have together  --  and I kept hoping it would come back . I suppose I thought it was my fault . p. 67 QUINCEY It was n't . ELLIE No . It 's just the way life is . The wind chimes stop . QUINCEY Wind chimes ? ELLIE The excitement goes , the thrill , the lust , whatever you want to call it . QUINCEY But that 's just the beginning . That 's when a relationship starts : when you stop lusting and start loving . ELLIE Is it ? QUINCEY You have to work at it . ELLIE How would you know ? You 've never had a relationship . You 've gone from college affair to college affair . QUINCEY We 're a relationship . ELLIE You 've stopped lusting ? QUINCEY ( Grins . ) Not entirely . When I first saw you at campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic table , hostessing . I sat down on the grass about twenty yards away and stared . I stared for two hours . For four years , I stared . You were my fantasy . When I finally got into a class of yours , my first grad year , your face was drawn and pained . Your hands shook . I wanted to run to the front of the room and hold you in my arms . p. 68 ELLIE I remember that day . It was the day after the accident . QUINCEY I watched you fall apart that year , piece by piece  --  and piece by piece , put yourself back together : stronger . I loved you for five years before I made love to you . And even then , your thoughts were somewhere else . I know that . I do n't care . You 're mine now . ELLIE Quincey . Go on to bed , honey . QUINCEY Where ? ELLIE In my room . I 'll have to move Margo . QUINCEY You ca n't do that . ELLIE Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather sleep with you . In our room . ELLIE I 'll be up as soon as I get Pat settled . QUINCEY Not too long . ELLIE At the rate she 's drinking , she wo n't be able to stand up much longer . ( QUINCEY goes upstairs , ELLIE goes into living room . ) PEGGY Come on in , Ellie . Have a drink . Pat and I were discussing old times . PAT ( To ELLIE ) Your old times . ( To PEGGY ) Ellie does n't drink . p. 69 PEGGY I remember when she did . On the front porch of the frat house , you drank half a pint of Bourbon and did God-knows-what with Sammy Kincaid and while poor Danny was out beating the bushes for you . ELLIE That 's why I do n't drink . PAT Peggy says your college days together were right out of A Date with Judy  --  Jane Powell and Shirley Temple , giggling girl friends . PEGGY Well , Ellie did have a crush on me . I remember that . You were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAT And you used to give me the answers in Economics III . I only took that course because all the brightest boys did . ELLIE The most-likely-to-succeeds ? ( Pause . ) Morty wanted to sleep with you and you told him you could n't because you were in love with me . PEGGY He was a creep . I wanted to shock him . ELLIE He spread it all over the campus . PEGGY It was a kick . Well , it was n't true . Anyone who knew me , knew that . ELLIE I didn't. p. 70 PEGGY The jocks used to line up in the lounge to see me . ELLIE Yes . And Saint Patrick 's night our sophomore year , you got into my bed . PEGGY I was drunk . I thought you were Jim . ELLIE You had n't even met Jim then . PEGGY Well , I thought you were Morty . PAT Morty was a creep . ELLIE New Year 's Eve . Remember New Year 's Eve ? You were engaged to Jim . At midnight , everybody kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In front of the whole fucking fraternity house . Jim walked out . You did n't see him again until spring semester . PEGGY I did n't meet him until spring semester . PAT Will the real Perfect Peggy please stand up ? PEGGY It did n't happen ! Not like that . ELLIE It did . And it 's happening again . With Wanda . PEGGY I 'm not a lesbian ! ( She runs upstairs to the guest bedroom , stage left . ) PAT It was n't real . p. 71 ELLIE It was ! PAT Even if it happened , it was n't real . Unadmitted , without commitment . ELLIE It was so perfect . PAT You never faced the bills together , you never faced joblessness together , you never built a house together , a life together . You never faced death together . It was n't real . We were real . ELLIE We did n't work . PAT Why ? I do n't know why . I love you . ELLIE You do n't love you . PAT All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crappy thing to be . You ca n't do anything ! I saw my father raking in the money , playing big business , flying to Europe , to the Caribbean , buying booze and women in every part of the globe while my mother ran the diaper brigade for eight kids . She never got farther than the corner A&amp;P . Her conversation was limited to baby talk and what she heard on the radio . My father met Al Capone  --  met him ! While my mother was scrubbing underwear on a washboard . Here 's your choice , kiddies . Which one would you rather be ? ELLIE Your father was a crook . What 's good about that ? PAT Is a crook . A successful one . The main man in Boston . My mother 's dead of a heart attack . p. 72 ELLIE I did n't know . PAT Last year . ELLIE I did n't know . PAT It does n't matter . She 's been dead for forty years . We finally buried her . But he goes on . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Give us a chance , Ellie . ELLIE It 's too late . PAT Ca n't you remember how it was ? We built a home together : we made love on that beach at midnight and sailed that broken-down boat under the stars until dawn . We were safe from the world . ELLIE For a while . PAT Then you started teaching . You were gone so much , seeing new people . That 's why I went out with other women , Ellie . To make you know how much you loved me . ELLIE The wind chimes stopped . And we did n't know how to make it work . Too much has happened . We ca n't go back . PAT Let me come home , Ellie . ELLIE I 'm sorry . This is n't your home anymore . ( PAT lunges for the front door and exits as MARGO comes down the stairs . ) MARGO ( To PAT ) Hey ! It 's cold out there . ( To ELLIE ) Should n't you go after her ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very drunk , Margo . She 'll wander around in the snow until she gets cold and wet enough to come in . As long as she ca n't move the car , she 's safe . MARGO You know her very well . ELLIE I thought I did . MARGO Are you still in love with her ? ( ELLIE turns , shocked . ) I 'm not blind . ELLIE I 'm sorry . I did n't intend to bring you into all of this . MARGO Are you ? ELLIE I love her . I remember being in love with her . ( Pause . ) No . MARGO Quincey ? ELLIE She loves me . MARGO That was n't the question . ELLIE Quincey says that once the thrill goes , when the knees stop trembling and the wind chimes stop tinkling , it 's a job . You 've got to work at it . MARGO She 's right . ELLIE Pat and I did n't know how to do that . MARGO But Quincey does . p. 74 ELLIE Probably . But I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't ? ELLIE Not with Quincey . I love her . I appreciate her , I 'm thankful for her . But no chimes . Ever . MARGO I was married to a man once , much like Pat . Worse , I guess . He was not only a drunk but a violent drunk . And I loved him . I loved him long after I left him . And I loved again . A woman . She died ten years ago . ELLIE ( Surprised ) I 'm sorry . MARGO I have n't written a publishable book since that time . I have n't let another human being touch me since that time . Oh , I 've slept with a few . I picked up a salesman in the bar downstairs from my hotel room . He was from Detroit . I never saw him again . Another time , a bellhop . And a woman reporter from a newspaper upstate . She was in town for the afternoon to interview me . But they did n't touch me : not emotionally , not really physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's hard to make anything last , Ellie . A job , a talent , a marriage . ELLIE A lot of people do it . MARGO A lot of people hold on to dead things . But to make something last  --  and live . . . It 's harder with a woman . There are no rules . And the stakes are so very high . ( They look at each other for a moment . ) We worked at it . We worked very hard at it . We brought new things into our relationship , we challenged one another with ideas , with goals . We were n't always successful . We had bad years , years when I was sure it was over , when I thought it should be over . But we survived them , somehow . It was good again , it was working . ( Pause . ) I think I hated her for dying , for leaving me . And I was very frightened . I still am. p. 75 ELLIE But you 've learned to be alone . MARGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share , to be a part of something . ELLIE But they do n't last . It does n't last . You start to build  --  and it 's over . You start again  --  and it 's over . Why bother ? MARGO Because you need it . I need it . And we keep hoping , all of us : men and women , women and women , men and men , that we can make it work . What do you want , Ellie ? ELLIE Someone to grow with . Someone to build with . MARGO You can do that with Quincey . What do you want , Ellie ? ELLIE I want it all . I want to tremble . I want that kind of crazy desire that surmounts reason . I want someone to live for , to die with . Someone to climb mountains for , slay dragons for , someone to snuggle with by a fire when the world is cold . I want a lover consumed by the greatest passion , a partner possessed of the greatest loyalty , a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passion . With Quincey , there is loyalty . I do n't want to settle . I want it all . I thought I 'd had it all with Peggy . Passion , loyalty , friendship . I thought it had been perfect . But it was so long ago and I was so young . I knew less than . Maybe I needed less , too . p. 76 MARGO Does she remember it as perfect ? ELLIE She does n't remember it at all . ( QUINCEY appears at the head of the stairs . ) QUINCEY Are you coming up ? ELLIE In a minute . ( QUINCEY comes down the stairs . ) QUINCEY Where 's Pat ? MARGO She 's outside . Waiting for spring . QUINCEY Is she all right ? ELLIE I want to wait and see . Go back to bed , honey . I 'll be up in a minute . QUINCEY Okay . Hurry . ( She goes back up the stairs . ) MARGO What are you going to do , Ellie ? ELLIE I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ELLIE ( Pause . ) Because I liked you . MARGO Liked me ? ELLIE Because I felt something . The night we talked in my hotel room , I felt something . p. 77 MARGO What ? ELLIE I do n't know . Something . A beginning . MARGO And what are you going to do about it ? ELLIE ( Pause . ) Wait . MARGO Why ? ELLIE Because I 'm scared . Because I 'm tonguetied when I talk to you , and my knees feel weak . When I stand near you there 's electricity between us like a living thing . Because something great is growing here and I 'm afraid for it to start . I do n't want it to end . And I do n't know what you want . MARGO ( After a long moment ) I want you . ( Holds out her arms . ) Do n't settle , Ellie . ( ELLIE goes into MARGO 's arms as PAT comes quietly in the back door , wet and drunken . She see what is happening and sneaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is staring out the window at the lake . ) PAT Hi , there . PEGGY It 's the abominable snowman . PAT The boat has a hole in it . ( From the bedroom : ) p. 78 QUINCEY Ellie ? ( In the living room : ) ELLIE ( To MARGO ) I 've got to go . MARGO Not yet . ( Upstairs : ) PAT ( Crossing the hallway to QUINCEY 's room ) Hi . QUINCEY Hi . PAT ( Explaining ) The boat has a hole in it . QUINCEY What ? PAT Ellie wants you downstairs . ( QUINCEY gets up as PAT goes back to PEGGY 's room . ) PEGGY Do n't sit on the bed . You 're all wet . PAT You want me to take them off ? PEGGY No ! ( Downstairs : ) MARGO You 've got to make a decision , Ellie . ( Upstairs : ) PAT I will if you will . PEGGY Stop it ! ( She starts to cry. ) p. 79 PAT Hey , I 'm sorry . ( Downstairs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . I have everything at stake . ( Upstairs : ) PAT Come on , cut the waterworks . PEGGY Hold me . Please hold me . I 'm so afraid . PAT ( Doing it ) Perfect Peggy . ( QUINCEY comes down the stairs , unsuspectingly turns the corner . ) QUINCEY Ellie ? ( She sees ELLIE and MARGO . Turns , runs up the stairs . ) ELLIE Quincey ! QUINCEY No ! ( She runs into the room , slams and locks the door . ELLIE follows . ) ELLIE Quincey ! Quincey ? QUINCEY No ! MARGO ( At the foot of the stairs ) Leave her alone , Ellie . ( ELLIE slowly comes down the steps . As the lights in the upstairs room dim to black . ELLIE and MARGO move to the sofa in the firelight . They lie down together and the firelight slowly dims then cross fades to dawn. ) p. 80 PAT Rise and shine ! ( QUINCEY in her room and PEGGY in hers hear and rise and hurriedly begin to dress . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late snow is melting into spring . MARGO ( Sitting up ) Why are n't you hung over ? ELLIE ( Sleepily ) She never is . MARGO It 's criminal . PAT Rise and shine , Ellie , put on the coffee ! We itinerants have to get packing . MARGO Make it yourself , you chauvinist pig . ELLIE Believe me , you would n't want to drink it . ( PAT 's in the kitchen , getting the pot out . ) PAT The pot , coffee , measuring cup : all ready ! ( ELLIE rises , goes to the kitchen . PAT countercrosses to the living room . To MARGO ) Sleep well ? MARGO Fine , thank you . What about you ? Did you sleep in the snow ? PAT I came in . ( Pause . ) Upstairs with Perfect Peggy . p. 81 MARGO You 're very sure of yourself , are n't you ? PAT Not at all . I know what I want . MARGO Not Peggy . PAT Not Peggy . . . . I 'm a gambler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell . Your odds are bad . She 's a three-time loser . And I know the track . Are you betting win , place , or show ? MARGO Across the board . PAT Want some advice ? MARGO No . PAT Come back to town with me . I 'll take you to dinner , we 'll get to know each other . I 'm a very interesting person . MARGO ( Smiles . ) No . PAT I 'd make a great character for a book . You can study me . MARGO ( Smiles . ) No . PAT I ca n't take you out of the running , huh ? MARGO ( Smiles . ) No . ( ELLIE has put on the coffee and goes upstairs . She knocks on QUINCEY 's door. ) p. 82 ELLIE Quincey ? PAT I 'm going out to start the car . But I 'm not going far . Ever . ( Upstairs : ) ELLIE Quincey . ( QUINCEY unlocks the door , admits ELLIE . Downstairs : ) PAT Consider yourself warned . ( Upstairs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her here . ELLIE No . QUINCEY It was n't enough in Philadelphia . ELLIE That 's not how it happened . QUINCEY And Chicago and Des Moines and how many other cities , how many other conferences , how many other business trips ? I 've been sitting home like an idiot , believing you . ELLIE It never happened before . QUINCEY What was I ? A convenient place to rest ? ELLIE I wanted it to work with us , Quincey . QUINCEY You never worked at it . My whole life is constructed around you . I ca n't write what I want to , it reflects on you . I ca n't be who I am , you 'll lose your job . " May I ask someone home for supper ? May I have the key to the cabin ? May I use the car ? May I , may I , may I ? " Ellie decides everything . What Ellie wants , what Ellie needs , how Ellie wants to live . I do n't even exist ! p. 83 ELLIE I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a commitment to me ! ELLIE I did n't want to . Do you remember that ? I did n't want to . QUINCEY I thought you 'd learn to love me . ELLIE I wanted to . I really wanted to . QUINCEY We 're good together ! ELLIE No . It is n't enough , Quincey . It 's bad for me  --  it 's bad for you . You have so much love to give . QUINCEY I love you . ELLIE I love you . But not the right way . QUINCEY Is this just an affair ? A week ? A month ? I 'll wait . ELLIE No . QUINCEY I 'm good for you . ELLIE But I 'm not good for you . You 're young , you can be free , you can be open , you can build the kind of life you want . You can fight for what you believe in . You can make a difference , Quincey . There 's a world of women out there , young women , who 'll stand with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . QUINCEY Are you in love with her ? ELLIE I do n't know yet . I think so . QUINCEY Then you 're not in love with me . You 've never been in love with me . ( Pause . ) I guess I 've always known that . I thought I could make it happen . ELLIE I never lied to you . QUINCEY Not in words . By holding me , living with me , making love to me . You lied to me . ( She hits the wind chimes at the window . ) I heard them . You did n't . You used me . That 's the most degrading part of all . ELLIE I 'm sorry . QUINCEY I have some sweaters and things in the drawers . I 'd like to pack them . ( Pause . ) Can I use that duffel bag ? ELLIE ( Nods . Going to her . ) Quincey . . . QUINCEY ( Pulling away ) For God 's sake , leave me with some dignity . ( ELLIE backs from the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . PEGGY comes out of the bathroom , dressed. ) p. 85 PEGGY Good morning . ( She goes into her bedroom , gets her suitcase . ) Ready to go . Hope I can get my car out . ELLIE You 're leaving ? PEGGY I 'm going home . ELLIE Oh . PEGGY I have a life there . It 's not what I had in mind , but it 's mine . ELLIE With Jim ? PEGGY He wo n't change . Neither can I. ELLIE And Wanda ? PEGGY Wanda is my friend . That 's all . That 's the way it 's going to stay . I ca n't deal with it , Ellie . It takes courage : a kind I have n't got . ELLIE You came here for help . I 'm afraid I did n't offer much . PEGGY I came looking for an answer . An answer that worked for me . I found it . I have a nice house , two lovely children , a good job . I 'll settle for that . ( She proceeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters from the yard . ) PAT Car 's started . We 'll have no problem getting out . PEGGY What about mine ? p. 86 PAT It 's only a couple of feet from the road . PEGGY Would you do it for me ? PAT My pleasure . PEGGY Now . PAT Do n't you want a cup of coffee first ? PEGGY I 'll stop on the road . I want to go home . Before I change my mind . ( She extends her hand . ) Ellie , thanks . Do n't go to any more New Year 's Eve parties . It gets everybody in a lot of trouble . ( PEGGY and PAT exit . QUINCEY comes down the stairs , carrying the duffel bag . She and ELLIE look at one another for a minute . ) QUINCEY I want the apartment . I decorated it and I want it . ELLIE ( Meekly ) All right . QUINCEY Call me when you want to pick up your things . I wo n't be there . ( She pauses , looks at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . ( She looks at MARGO . ) I suppose I 'll see you around campus . ( She crosses to the door . ) Work at it . ( She exits. ) p. 87 ELLIE Will we have this moment ? MARGO There are no guarantees . ELLIE Perfect Peggy settled . MARGO Some people have to . ( Pause . ) And some people ca n't . ( ELLIE pours a cup of coffee and hands it to MARGO . ) ELLIE The snow 's almost gone . ( PAT enters brightly , takes the coffee out of MARGO 's hand , sips it . ) PAT Thanks . Well , Peggy 's on her way . You always had good taste , Ellie . ( She pockets a piece of paper . ) Her phone number . She needs an occasional appraisal . ( She gulps the rest of MARGO 's coffee , hands her the empty cup . ) Quincey 's waiting in the car . ELLIE Thanks for delivering the hutch . PAT It 's okay . I overcharged her . ( To MARGO ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be waiting at the finish line . ( She kisses ELLIE on the cheek . ) See you soon , Ellie . p. 88 ELLIE No . PAT ( Shaking MARGO 's hand ) Good luck . MARGO We 're running on a long track , Pat . PAT I 've got a lot of patience . ( PAT exits . ELLIE watches them go . MARGO pours two cups of coffee . ) MARGO Black ? ELLIE Fine . MARGO ( Gives the coffee to ELLIE . ) Where will you live ? ELLIE I 'll find an apartment . MARGO I 'll need to live near campus . How would that look , our living together ? ELLIE Do you care ? MARGO No . ELLIE Neither do I. I 'm tired of living a half-life . MARGO So am I. ELLIE I ca n't march . But I wo n't hide . ( She moves to window . ) What 's your favorite color ? MARGO Blue . p. 89 ELLIE Favorite flower ? MARGO Marigold . ELLIE Favorite season ? MARGO Summer . ELLIE Favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smiling ) Pomegranate ? ( Both are at the window . ) ELLIE The snow is gone . The sun is out . ( She opens the window . ) Favorite person ? ( The wind chimes tinkle in the breeze . They both laugh . MARGO holds out her arms . ) Let 's try to keep it that way . ( The lights fade in the foreground until the two women are silhouetted in the morning sun . ) CURTAIN ( end of play )
