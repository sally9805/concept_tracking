A month ago , when President Ford invited six fellow world leaders to meet in Puerto Rico for a discussion of economic issues , his move was widely criticized both at home and abroad as a political ploy . The meeting was called , so went the criticism , to strengthen the President 's chance of gaining the Republican nomination over Challenger Ronald Reagan . The summit did serve that purpose . Ford , who is at his best in small groups , enhanced his status as a world statesman last week by playing the charming and well-briefed host to British Prime Minister James Callaghan , French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing , West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , Italy 's lame-duck Premier Aldo Moro , Japanese Premier Takeo Miki and Canada 's Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . <P> Fortunately , the Puerto Rico summit served less narrow purposes as well . The atmosphere was almost totally different from the first economic summit last November , when the leaders spent a weekend at the Chteau de Rambouillet near Paris as the guests of Giscard . Then the mood was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the leaders talked for eight hours at the Dorado Beach Hotel , overlooking a palm-lined shore , the mood was optimistic . The only real worry was that the world recovery might be proceeding too quickly . <P> The warning sign is a sudden resurgence of inflation . From January through May , prices have been rising at a faster rate than in 1975 in four of the seven nations represented at Puerto Rico . The British rate , though it declined from 24.9% to 15.7% , remains ruinously high . Meanwhile , the Japanese tempo has nearly doubled , and Italy 's rate has rocketed to potentially catastrophic proportions ( see chart ) . The U.S. has reduced its rate to an acceptable level-by following politically painful policies of holding down growth and accepting a high level of unemployment . <P> Spiraling inflation was the major factor that turned the 1971-73 boom years into the worst global recession since the 1930s . Two of the hallmarks of the last inflation are once more highly visible : rising commodity prices ( one key index has climbed 30% since last November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries , notably France ( where it is currently growing at an annual rate of 22% ) . <P> Since a renewal of inflation could choke off the worldwide recovery , Ford was eager to get his fellow leaders to commit themselves to a go-slow approach to recovery . That is scarcely a policy that entrances voters . As Treasury Secretary William Simon put it : " Preaching moderate growth is like trying to sell leprosy . " But Ford had a powerful ally in West Germany 's Schmidt , a former Finance Minister who believes that combatting inflation should be the No. 1 priority among the industrialized democracies . By , contrast , Britain and Italy , which are lagging behind in the recovery , would still like to achieve U.S. and German-style growth rates as a means of reducing their unemployment . <P> Even so , the U.S.-West German viewpoint prevailed . The final communique stated : " Our objective now is to manage effectively a transition to expansion which will be sustainable , which will reduce the high level of unemployment which persists in many countries and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inflation .
