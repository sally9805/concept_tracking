txt Sen. Edward M. Kennedy is moving closer to an active presidential candidacy . But the question remains : Will he challenge Jimmy Carter and take the chance of splitting the Democratic Party ? Sources close to the Senator say the answer to that continues to be no , but that in recent days Mr. Kennedy 's resolve against such a move has lessened considerably . Since his mother and his wife , as disclosed last Friday ( Sept. 7 ) , have indicated they do not object to his running , the Senator is understood to view the road ahead in this manner : He is acutely aware that should his actions divide the party , his nomination could be an empty victory that could lead to his own defeat and that of Democratic candidates all over the United States . A deeply loyal Democrat , Senator Kennedy would do nothing actively to hurt or weaken the party . However , he recently has been persuaded his candidacy might help the party and fellow Democratic candidates ? and that has moved him closer to running . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an asset to the party as a potential nominee ? at a time when the same polls indicate President Carter will drag down the party ? tell only a tentative , preliminary story . He is quite aware that , should he get involved in an active challenge against a to-the-bitter-end President , the political struggle could leave the party divided between Carter supporters and Kennedy supporters , with the angry Carterites either voting for the Republican presidential candidate or not voting at all . Thus , while edging closer to running , Senator Kennedy still is holding back // 15 From page 1 Kennedy still noncandidate barely But short of becoming a declared candidate , he can still play games . He can let the draft movement go on . He can even issue statements , as he did in recent days . indicating that the road to candidacy has been cleared considerably ( by his mother 's and wife 's expression of support for " such a candidacy ) . But he is still a distance from the final decision that must take into account both risks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might find that wisdom lies on the side of finally taking himself completely out of the race with a Sherman-like declaration . A Carter comeback in the polls in the next 90 days could be very persuasive toward bringing about that result . An early indication that the Senator was seriously thinking about running in 1980 came in a Monitor story in the spring of 1978 that disclosed that Kennedy was telling friends of this quickening interest . An amusing and hitherto unpublished story followed that Monitor disclosure . The Senator , on encountering the reporter who wrote the article , laughed and said , " Hey , you got my campaign going . " Senator Kennedy enjoys the speculation stirred up by stories . And he appreciates that being looked upon as a possible , or likely , candidate gives him added clout as a senator . This , of itself , will cause him to wait as long as possible to drop out of the race ? if , in the end , he does drop out . There is a new view growing in the political circles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing feeling among political experts is that should California Gov . Edmund G. Brown Jr . prove successful in the early primaries , the Massachusetts Senator will be drawn in ? to keep the nomination away from Mr. Brown . But what Senator Kennedy really wants is for the President to look at his low standings and decide to bow out . Mr. Kennedy would like to move in then , keeping Carter support and an undivided party . But at this point Mr. Carter is not being cooperative . Furthermore , no one who knows the President well says there is a chance in the world that he will step aside for anyone , particularly Ted Kennedy . Senator Kennedy talked to the President at a private White House luncheon last Friday , and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Sunday ( Sept. 9 ) that the Senator suggested Mr. Carter not run for re-election . The report said Mr. Kennedy was involved in a delicate strategy to ease the President out of the race , hoping that pressure would mount from other Democratic Party leaders , urging Mr. Carter to withdraw. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
