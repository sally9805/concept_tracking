It was n't her usual gig , but Lena Home , 55 , got turned on to Sesame Street by her grandchildren . There she was , reassuring Kermit the frog and singing Kermit 's favorite song , It 's Not That Easy Being Green , which is all about having green skin . " It 's a highly personal song to me , " she explained . " It is the same for me as it is for Kermit . " <P> There were 2,000 people , sure . The real draw , however , at Ethel Kennedy 's 15th annual Pet Show at Hickory Hill was the fauna-everything from dogs to two worms that were entered as twins . " We want to keep politics out of this show , " said Ringmaster Art Buchwald , but there was a slip-up in the Unusual Pet category . Two " Watergate bugs " got a blue ribbon . A chameleon named Richard Nixon took second prize . <P> Like a lot of other performers , Sonny and Cher Bono are at loose ends because of the TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are having a good time hopping from nightclub to concert . They scotch all rumors that their marriage is cracking up . " Who 'd get custody of all our Indian and Italian jokes ? " cracked Cher . <P> Princess Anne can be an absolute darling , but " she has imperious moods when that pendulous Windsor lower lip droops and the arrogance of centuries emerges . " Her Royal Highness was taking a drubbing from Punch , the British humor magazine , which wished she would let go with a " bit of divilment . " As it is , Anne shares a chilling trait with Elizabeth : " She has her mother 's look , which can freeze at 20 paces . " <P> With his dance-tired feet stuffed into a pair of worn and obviously comfortable shoes , Rudolf Nureyev-perhaps the world 's greatest danseur noble - accepted the annual Dance Magazine award in Manhattan . His speech was hardly audible , a sentence thanking the people who had helped him since he fled the U.S.S.R. During those twelve years in the West , Rudolf has performed mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Ballet of Canada . Except for old friends like Dancer Erik Bruhn and Actress Monique Van Vooren , his life is a solo . <P> What a circus ! And all to help actors in trouble . For the Union des Artistes in Paris , Actress Elsa Martinelli , wearing black opera hose , ran a couple of baby chimps through their paces . Dressed up as a bunny , Singer Jane Birkin popped out of a cake and walked a tightrope . The hit of the evening was a pie-throwing skit written by Director Claude Chabrol and starring Actor Marcello Mastroianni . Marcello then scrubbed himself down and returned for the 3 a.m. finale when the whole company dished up a giant vat of steaming spaghetti for the audience .
