hand of another , and we 'd walk along the lake through heat that rose from the gravel in silver shimmers , past the water tower , to a jetty of land overgrown with willows , and at the tip of this was a wooden footbridge fifty feet long . The bridge led across a neck of the lake to the park . Four or five high-school boys once trapped a girl on the bridge and stood hacking and spitting up " oysters , " as they called them , to the girl 's distress , and the word always reminded me of fetuslike clots floating over still water . " Grow up , " my mother said to them . Below the guardrails of the bridge were crisscrossed one-byeightspainted white , which gave it a primary and self-suspended look from a distance , as though children with no sense of mechanics had built it . It was supported at its center by a pier of railroad ties . I always stopped at the pier and hoisted myself up on my stomach and leaned over the rail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties beside my reflection , and watched for bullheads and carp , my face rippling with a greenish patina until I was the water , or so it seemed , and the water me . If I saw many large fish , and it often happened ( and once I saw a goldfish as long as my arm ) , I 'd resolve to bring my rod and go fishing the next day , but never did . It would have taken away from the time I had with her . " Jerome . Help me , please . " She shook out the blanket she 'd brought and I helped her hold it square and floating down to the grass , in the shade of a tree . Then I went into the men 's bathhouse , where a latticework of light lay on the floor from the cracks in the walls and roof , and undressed in the cool air and unrolled my towel and pulled on my swim suit , and then went to the corner , where a crack had been widened with a knife , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to see , but if everybody who looked from here had an intent as powerful as mine , then I 'm sure it 's the reason the bathhouse leaned in that direction . And the women 's bathhouse leaned toward the men 's . I 'd tie my shoelaces together , and fold my clothes and roll them up in the towel , and go outside , where sunlight on the water and the whitened pea gravel made Illy eye sockets and back teeth ache . The pea gravel was spread over the swimming area to keep back bloodsuckers ( or leeches : sunt*  --  lortit of fresh-waterp145Annelida ; we called them bloodsuckers there ) and I once saw a boy who waded beyond the gravel walk out of the water with bloodsuckers fringing his ankles like leaves . I 'd go to the blanket , blinking against the loss of color , and lie beside my mother , who was sitting or kneeling and undressing my brothers in public , and watch her hands move over their bodies and imagine their bodies were mine . This observance of affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being an older brother , and still does . If I could somehow recapturethe sound of her voice as she talked then , merely to talk to us and soothe in her musical way , I do n't believe it 'd be so necessary , now , for me to work so hard at every task , as though I could attain within myself some measure of perfection , or to comfort others and attempt to strengthen and repair their bodies and minds . I 'm an M.D.A wooden catwalk projected twelve feet into the water , with its trembling reflection beginning ten feet below , and at the end of the catwalk was the high-dive board . Alan Pflager , the lifeguard , was usually stretched out on his back on the board in the broad sun . I do n't think he ever had to assist a swimmer in trouble , and the one summer somebody nearly drowned  --  Brian Rimsky , fallingfrom the high dive when he was four  --  he was pulled from the water by Pat lanaccona ; it was the summer Alan Pflager had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , Jerome , " my mother said . I 'd lead my brothers to the edge of the lake and leave them , and wade out alone , always frightened , and dog paddle to the floating dock and pull myself onto it panting . And after I 'd rested , I 'd have to dive off and paddle back to shore . Neither my mother nor my father could swim , and my mother 's brother , my namesake , drowned when he was a boy . I 'd leave my brothers splashing and throwing gravel , and go to the blanket and lie down beside her . I could have a sandwich now , or a piece of pie , or an orange or an apple , which she always brought along in a covered basket . She usually had a book or two with her , also , and after I 'd eaten I 'd try to read over her shoulder , but she 'd close the book with a sigh and lay her head on her arms . I 'd turn on m-y back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she 'd say , " Oh , this heat tires nte , " and then she 'd glance in my direction ,  |p146and  I 'd see her closed eyes part to study me . Then she 'd become restless and roll on her back , one arm flung out on the grass , and murmur , " You 'd better go get your brothers . We better get going . Your dad 'll be home soon . " In the summer my father worked in the fields as a farmer , and for some reason the idea of this , and her bare arm lying on the grass , filled me with fear and an unnamable sympathy . And now I 'll have to tell it . One afternoon I got angry at her for the way she was being , however that was , and went downshorefrom the swimming area , where a set of rotting steps led down into a deep hole near the foot of the bridge , and sat on a step in water up to my throat and wondered how it would feel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drowned . It would be the sort of family story , because of the names , that would be repeated for generations to come , I was sure . My mother kept calling and , when I did n't answer or appear , sent Alan Pflager , who led me up the steps and into the bathhouse . " Time to go , " he said , and I told him to mind his own business and get out , and he did . I pulled down my swim suit and had to clear my eyes before I realized what I was seeing . A big bloodsucker was attached to the top of my thigh , close to my penis , and a tangle of babies were swirling in a clot of blood beside it . I screamed and started up and my swim suit around my ankles brought me down . My mother and Alan ran in , and she held me while he took a forbidden cigarette from his trousers on the wall , lit it , and touched it to the bloodsucker 's back . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell free , and went bowing out . " Hush , " my mother said . " People will think something awful has happened . " She wiped my thigh with her handkerchief and tried to put an arm around me , but I pushed her away . " What are you doing in here ? " I said . " You 're not supposed to be in here . " " All right , " she said . " Get dressed , then , and come out and help with your brothers . " She disappeared through the rectangularblaze of sunlight and left inc to me . If I 'd been able to think then , or had any thoughts , or been more mature or had foresight , I probably would have thought , This is how it is . This is the way it will be.  |p147A  family of fourteen had lived in the house for ten years . Their name was Russell . Mr. Lowell Russell was the sexton at St. Mary Margaret 's Catholic Church and the janitor of the parochial school , a frail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters , ranging in age from eleven to thirty-three , one son had thus far been ordained a priest and three daughters had become nuns . Another daughter was said to be an accomplished musician , and yet another had literary leanings , and these two composed the words and music of the school song still sung in Hyatt to this day ; it beginsWe 'll raise a lofty , mighty cheer for you , Straight from the hearts of students fond and true . . and concludesDeep as the ocean , our love and devotion For the Hy  --  ! Hy  --  ! Hyatt High School ! Martin Neumiller was now principal of the high school and had been annoyed for years by the stilted and solemn phrasing of the old song ( sung to the tune of " On , Wisconsin ! " ) , and per/suaded the Russell girls to write this new one . The parish owned the Russell house and everybody in the parish expected the Russells to live out their lives in it , a monument to the faith . But one day old Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his job and moving out of town . What ? He was grateful for all the parish had done , he said , but felt there were better opportunities in South Dakota for him and the children still at home . Father offered him the house rent-free . He could n't accept charity , he said . No , Hyatt was n't growing and would n't ever grow , he was afraid , and he wanted to get in on the boom down there around Rapid City , maybe go into business for himself , and he wanted his children to attend the better schools . Two months later the Russells were gone . They were a selfconfident , cloistered , close-knit family , nearly monastic in their devotion to the faith , and , other than the song , they left little trace of themselves behind when they moved . Father let their house stand vacant for a year , as if unable to admit they were gone . He did n't accept defeat gracefully , and was known by his fellow seminarians as the donkey , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , because of his resistance to the Third Reich , whose leaders he called thugs and idiots from the start , openly . Then he went to Rome to be ordained , in violation of one of Hitler 's edicts , and came back an enemy of the Reich and a marked man . He often talked in a cheerful manner about a winter manhunt for him conducted by the SS boys in black leather with their big black dogs . " After all , dey were chust ordinary louts up against me . And dere were plenty of people in and out of da church willing to help a priest . I made it to Switzerland . I ended up at Fargo Diocese . Dey said dat all dey had was Hyatt , and I said , ' Cif it to me ! ' And den when da people dey were so agreeable , I knew dis was da place for me . I ca n't ask more from life . " He had a painful-looking crease in his neck from his clerical collar , and came toward you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold in his front teeth gleaming , his jowls so heavy they made his forehead look small , and , ( low ul ) , triangular folds ofp149skin beside each eye disappearing into his hairline , his smile was such a wholehearted and consistent part of him ; a wide mouth with purplish lips stained tan in one corner from his panatelasand cigars ; water-blue eyes behind round gold rims . He loved children and knew every girl and boy in the parish by name , and never got names or siblings mixed up , and gave them all a quarter or a half or silver dollar on their birthdays , dependingon how well they were doing in school , since he was the figurehead of the parochial school and acting superintendent of it  --  and thus had been further hurt by Russell  --  and also kept track of all their grades . Not even the most retreating child in the village was afraid of him . In the big rectory there were potted plants on steps and sills , two walls lined with books , large mirrors , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather clock in his study , a dining room with French windows , an open maple stairway to the second story , and cases of foreign beer and wine in the basement . He had a housekeeper from Germany . The rectory was next to the church and next to it was the three-story parochial school of buff-and-clay-colored brick with its white cupola and white cross on top  --  all his domain . He 'd entered the seminary expecting to be a monk , and see how this tiny place had brought out the aristocrat and bohemian in him ! Ahem ! Once a week he had a card party that filled the rectory with tobacco smoke , while beer bottles went popping and cash passed hands . Was he leading the men in town , most of them prominent ones , down to the Devil ? No , no , they all understood it was just a way of having fun between the boys and getting away from the wives for a night . The wives needed time off , too . What was there to do in a town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But he should probably try to be a bit more priestly and businesslike in some matters , if he could . Now about this Russell place . He 'd heard the Neumillers were looking for a new house again . Well , let them have it ! And at a reasonable price , too . Who needed money ? The parish would have their new church within a few years , a brick one to replace the barnlike woodframeone they had now ( although he liked the old one ; his voice echoed itt it as in a cathedral ) , and that was all the parish asked of him , other than absolution , of course.  |p150Martin  was a devotee of his family and ambitious for them , but without guile  --  Biblical , as Father thought of him , because his purity and strength of character came out of unclouded ingenuousness . Over the years , Martin had become his best friend and confidant , his confessor , practically , and Martin had three intelligent , promising young sons . You could never tell where priest material might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyatt had n't been good ; Mrs. Glick promised to make herself " so scarce you wo n't know I 'm here " but never did ; in another place the furnace never worked properly and a smell that originated inside a kitchen wall was amazing , and since they did n't feel right about breaking into the wall of a house that did n't belong to them , and were afraid to complain because they 'd let it go so long , they kept wondering , What could it be ? and were never informed . In the last , the basement flooded to the floor joists in the spring ( bringingup buried salamanders that went floating out into the yard ) , and eroded the foundation so badly that walls began to part from the ceiling . And each place had its noisy population of mice and rats , driven indoors by the prolonged , windswept , blizzard-flayed winters , and not one of them was large enough . This was in 1945 , and the Neumillers ' three sons  --  Jerome , Charles , and Timothy  --  were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although Jerome , the oldest , was only five , Alpha was pregnant again . The Russell house had three bedrooms plus a big walk-in attic on the second story , and two more bedrooms downstairs . There was a living room with a bay window , a kitchen with a pantry as big as most kitchens , a basement with vegetable bins and shelves for canned food ; an indoor bathroom ( rare in Hyatt  --  there was no municipal water system ) with all of the fixtures ; a front porch , with turned posts and gingerbread trim ; an enclosed porch on the south side ; and , attached to the rear of the house , a lean-to which had once been used to stable a pony and was now a workshop and utility room and coal shed . The rent was twenty-five dollars a month . Alpha knew that a house was n't any better than the lives thatp151went on in it  --  some were wrecks after ten years , others stood fresh as morning after several hundred  --  and there was a feeling about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty rooms , saying , " The space ! The space ! The space ! " And less than a month later was leaning against a wall with her arms folded and a smile on her face , watching a dozen birthday guests ( Charles was four ) play Red Rover in her living room  --  her parlor , you might call it ; she saw herself as the heroine of a nineteenth-century novel filled with the moors , glamour , and more glamour . The room was so large that her upright piano , which had always been in the way in their other places , seemed to have shrunk three sizes . Her piano ! She sat down and started playing " Clair de Lune , " and the children stopped their game and stared at her as she played . Martin could understand how she felt . There were articles close to her heart , family samplers and other heirlooms , and wedding presents that had n't been unpacked since the day they were married , and some of their furniture  --  a dining-room set with inlays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been used . And around town and at the Friday-night pinochle games at Father 's , Martin was heard to say , " She loves the place , sure , how could she help it ? But it 's always been like this . The happiest times of her life have been when we 've moved . " Martin 's father had started his own carpentry business in Illinois , but was visiting relatives and friends around Mahomet , so he drove up to Hyatt to help them move , and somehow got stuck with bringing in the basement junk , and toward the end of the day stopped in front of Alpha with a solemn face , and said , " I 've carried nine hundred and ninety empty fruit jars down these stairs , I want you to know . " He made minor repairs around the house , and persuaded Martin to pour a concrete slab that began at the outside wall of the lean-to , went in a wide-swinging arc around the corner of the house , beyond the steps of the enclosed porch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day to do it , and Martin 's father finished troweling it by the light of a floor lamb Martin held above him , then leaned back on hisp152haunches , his trowel turned up with gray bubbles streaking its face , and said , " There . Now the boys have a place to ride their tricycles , Martin . " Martin took Jerome and Charles upstairs into a room overlooking the street corner , where an enormous roll-top desk stood against one wall . " Look , " he said , and turned to them as though offering a gift that would soon appear in his hands . They glanced at one another , and Jerome shrugged . " Well , do n't you see what 's happened ? " he asked . They did n't see . " First of all , you can tell by looking it never could have come up the stairs . They 're too narrow . The door to this room is even narrower , and the windows are narrower yet . " He squatted at the desk and rapped on it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The corners have been dovetailed and then trimmed over . You can feel the dovetailing here in the back . Right here . Now , nobody could take this apart , once it was built , without damaging the wood somewhere , especially the dovetails , and they certainly would have left a mark on it . But the finish is practically perfect  --  the original , I 'd guess . It 's handrubbed . Is n't it lovely ? " They nodded , eager to get their hands behind the desk and onto that dovelike , cooing , feathery or whatever surface he was talking about . " There 's only one conclusion ! " he said . " When this place was built , an old cabinetmaker came into the house here , carried his hand tools and materials up to this room , and built the desk on the spot where we 're standing right now ! But why would anybodywant to build a desk like this way up here ? " Mysteries , for Martin , were a source of delight . There was nothing unnatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to be explored and marveled at , but never feared , and seldom explained . Where others saw no mystery , he could find it , and kept himself in a constant state of childlike wonder , exuberance , and joy . His father stepped into the room , and said , " Why would anybody want a desk up here ? Why , Mart in , to enjoy it ! " Alpha was surprised that the inside of the house was n't more beat up . Fourteen people had lived its it lot more than a decade , after all , and from the outside it seemed that it would be ; paint  |p153was  flaking from the north side , the roof of the lean-to sagged , and the hedge that bordered it on three sides had grown up to the windows of the second story . But it was structurally sound , Martin 's father said , surprisingly so , and the hardwood floors did n't need refinishing ; the baseboards were battered , but otherwisethe old oak woodwork , the sliding doors of oak to the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs , the bookshelves around the bottom of the bay window , were hardly scratched , and their gold-and-black grain stood out as though new-minted and burnished to its highest sheen . There were no stains or adolescent carvings on the roll-top desk upstairs . The Russells had left with the desk a matching chair that looked brand-new , and Alpha could n't understand why , unless it 'd been there when they moved in , and they were that honest . There was no other clue to their life in the house , no old receipts or letters , no stray socks in any closet , not even a drawing or set of initials on the walls , or , as she put it , " not a speck of themselves or their dirt . " The attic , however , was filled full of valuables , none of them the Russells ' , and they were so layered with dust it looked as if the Russells had never touched them ; these belonged to the Halvorsons , the family who 'd built the house and lived in it in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the flyleaves of books , underneath chair seats , and even written , along with a set of measurements , across the bosom of an old raggedy dress form . In the attic Martin found a large , decaying , leather-bound volume , A Century-End History and Biography of North Dakota , and in it an engraving of a daguerreotype of Mr. Halvorson , a twin to a picture of him in a shoe box , along with this : ALVARD J. HALVORSON . This gentleman , of whom a portrait will be found on the opposite page , occupiesa prominent position as a real-estate dealer in Hyatt , Stusrud County . To his influence is due much of the solid prosperity of Stusrud and Ecklund Counties . Our subject was born in Hamlin Township , Michigan ,  |p154Aug.  1 , 1839 , and was the only son of William and Dora ( Waldorf ) Halvorson , the former of Scandinavian and the latter of German descent . Mr. Halvorson was raised on his father 's farm and attended country schools and at the age of nineteen went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later was engaged in business and also in farming with his father in Indiana for about twenty years . Our subject moved to Valley City , North Dakota , in the fall of 1879 and became interested in Stusrud County lands in 1881 , since which time A. J. HALVORSON CO. has added as much as perhaps any other firm in the development of the possibilities of the agricultural and stock-raising interests of North Dakota , and he now conducts an extensive realestatebusiness in Hyatt , where the family located in 1895 , two years after the founding of Hyatt . Our subject was married at Indianapolis , Indiana , in 1865 , to Miss Catherine Maxwell , who is of Scottish descent . Mr. and Mrs. Halvorson are the parents of three children who bear the following names : Olivia C. , Alice N. , and Lydia . The two older children were born in Indiana and the last named in North Dakota . Politically , Mr. Halvorson is a Republican and has taken a highly active part in affairs pertaining to local government . Nobody living in Hyatt at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they 'd moved and left so much behind , or where they 'd gone from here . Martin drove to McCallisterand did research in the county record books and did n't find many allusions to Mr. Halvorson , but learned how it was possible for him and his family to be forgotten the way they were ; the area had changed that much . The U.S. Cavalry , while routing out the last of the Sioux in the area , used to bivouac near the village site , on a prominence now called Hawk 's Nest , and the village itself was plotted in 1892 by Richard Hyatt , an English lord , and began as a settlement of wealthy and cultivated Englishmen and Scots ( one of whom constructed the artificial lake and a nine-hole golf course at the edge of town ) , and then turned into a trading center for the German and Scandinavian and Irish immigrants who homesteaded in the area , and for ap155while was the county seat ; and then after being missed by the main line of the railroad , and suffering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the county hall hauled away to Fessenden in the dead of the night , it became what it was now , a poor village , mostly German and Roman Catholic , with only the lake remaining as a reminder of its past . " It seems old Hyatt knew his Longfellow well enough to name the lake Hiawatha , " Martin said . " And had the taste not to name it Gitche Gumee . " Hyatt 's population was two hundred and thirtytwo , a figure Martin knew before he began his research ; he 'd taken the 1940 census . Families other than the Russells must have lived in the house since the Halvorsons , but it looked as though nobody had bothered their effects in the attic , as though to tamper with them or remove them were to tamper with the heart of the house . Could that be ? Or maybe they 'd had so many possessions ( was n't the desk theirs ? ) that people had merely taken what they wanted without much diminishing a large , original store . Martin , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when they left , if they ever did , he was going to take those candlesticks , that teapot , the horse collar there , and a wheelbarrowful of these books . Alpha said that just to stand in the place made her temperaturedrop ten degrees , and she 'd rather he left everything the way it was . " But what about these ? " He held up a set of copper bowls with pewter medallions on their handles . " These are collector 's items for sure . " " I have more bowls than I know what to do with already . " " What about a book ? Would n't you like to read a few of these books ? " " I would if I 'd bought them . " She picked up Timmy , who was dropping fluffs of dust into a china commode , and started out the door . " Let 's have an auction , " Jerome said . " Let 's sell all of this stuff and make a bunch of money . " He and Charles were sorting through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , " Alpha said . " They are n't yours . I do n't want the two of you playing in this attic  --  ever , you understand.  |p156I  want the hook at the top of the door to stay hooked , the way the Russells had it when they were here . You do n't belong in this place . " They turned to their father , who was rummaging through a round-topped trunk bound with leather straps , and Jerome asked if they could move this  --  he rapped on an old Victrola with a knuckle  --  and all these records into the room next to the attic ; the door was plenty big , he pointed out . Martin 's eyes were bright and abstracted , and , unaware that Alpha had spoken , he said , " Sure . Why not ? Let 's get it in there and see if it works . " The Victrola sat in a corner of the upstairs room that became their playroom , near the door that led to the attic . It was such a tall machine they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its turntable , and inside its lifted cover , beveled like a coffin lid , " Lydia " had been scratched into the wood with something sharp , and the name , foreign to them , seemed strangely appropriatethere ; no needles survived with the machine , so their father fashioned one anew from the end of a nipped-off safety pin . They found only a single record they liked among those in the attic , and the rest , thick Edison records with hymns on them , they sailed out a second-story window toward Brian and Leo Rimsky and Douglas Kuntz and other of their friends , who stomped on the ones that went rolling , and caught some they tried to sail back . They played that same record over and over , in spite of the scratches on it  --  years of them , layers of them  --  that made the metallic tenor sound as though it came out of the center of a gale , and never tired of hearing the voice tell about Sal , a maiden fair , singing Polly Wolly Doodle all the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They stood on the stool and worked the crank , staring at the name scratched into the lid . " Fare thee well ! Fare thee well ! Fare thee well , my fairy fay ! " The voice was adenoidal and no matter how many times it brought up , frail and tinny from the ancient grooves , the image of a grasshopper sitting on a railroad track ( singing Polly Wolly Doodle all the day ) , they always had to getp157down , laughing , and roll around and slap the floor to get themselvessane again . They had their own library in the playroom , and they had clay , blocks , marbles , and mallets , dominoes , Lincoln Logs , an electric train ; and a handmade alphabet with wooden characters five inches high , which they 'd found in the attic and kept in dullgreenammunition boxes their Uncle Jay had brought back from the war . But none of their toys captured their interest like the Victrola , and when they were n't playing it , they spent hours at the roll-top desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Here is where I 'm going to sit when I write that book of mine , " a project he talked about often , especially after an unusual or moving experience , or after he 'd told a story out of his past . He referred to the book , simply , as " the book of my life . " When he 'd been up to the room for an evening , Jerome and Charles would go to the desk the next day , slide its slatted cover up , and search through the drawers and cubbyholes for evidence of the book , in which they hoped to be included , pulling the wonderful pranks they pulled . Usually there was a neat pile of paper in the center of a green blotter , with a pen beside it , presumably full of ink . A bottle of ink and one of eradicator stood ready , as did the large , leather-bound volume from the attic , appropriated now , too . There was also a portable Underwood typewriter that their father let them bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories of theirs . Digging through the pigeonholes of the desk , they found old letters , scripts of dramatic and patriotic readings their father had performed in high school and college , a rubber stamp that reproducedhis tall , tilted signature , a watch fob braided of his mother 's hair ( a lighter shade then ) , a broken pocket watch , some rocks from the Badlands , and a tiny tube they could look into and see a pyramidical pile of fieldstone and the inscription , Geographical Center of North America , Rugby , North Dakota . In a drawer was a half-filled box of flaky cigars with " It 's a Boy ! " on their cellophanes , and in another a metal file that contained insurance policies , birth certificates ( their own and their parents ' , too , which was unsettling ) , government savings bonds inp158their names , and their father 's baby book . In the center drawer were pens and pencils and a ream of that same white paper , which never seemed to diminish .

They could n't resist the temptation of the attic , although their mother was upset by this . She disliked the place , disliked even more the idea of anybody 's being in it ( she never entered it herself ) , and was so fervent and humorless in her dislike that their father started calling North Dakota " That cold-storage box way up at the top . The attic of the United States ! " They 'd put a record on the Victrola , move a stool to the attic door , unlatch the hook , ease the door open wide , and sunlight coming through a window in the far wall fell over them with a warmth sunlight had nowhere else . Cobwebs powdered with dust , and shining filaments recently strung in place , sparkled in a shifting radiance inside the golden air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes and trunks of memorabilia , a wooden wardrobewith a dress sword and sash hanging from its top , chairs , books , an oval mirror that held their tilting reflections , stood around them in solid eloquence . Charles tiptoed over to a settee , upholstered in red velvet dam/aged by moths and mice , and sat down . He bounced his weight on its springs . Who 'd sat here ? What had they talked about ? Had anybody cried on it , as he had on their couch ? Or done a flip on it ? He looked at Jerome , who had n't moved since they 'd stepped inside ; the Halvorsons ' effects were as real and awesome as a roomful of strangers , and part of a world removed from them by time  --  by half a century , their father said  --  and by convention and law : the world of adults . But here they could handle and examine that world in detail , in its many manifestations ( and only through touch would it give up its mystery ) , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms below . Only a few moments after they 'd unhooked the door , they 'd hear , " Are you two into that attic again ? " from the foot of the stairs . " No ! " Both at the same time ; a dead giveaway . " You stay out of there when your father 's not around ! You hear ? " " We are n't in here , " Charles said . " Do n't lie to your mother ! " They looked at one another  --  Jerome pushing out in a curl his big upper lip  --  and then Jerome went over and began to examinean object of more interest than Charles 's numskull knavery , as Charles picked up a wooden doll with most of its limbs missing , while the dented and damaged dress form , made of varnished strips of paper lifting up in crisp translucent curves , stood above them , unmoving and silent , like a second , more permissive mother .

What would you think if I was a girl ? " He wrinkled up his nose and giggled like one . " Quit it , " Jerome said . " Put it back . " He was more like his mother ; a dress was too personal to disturb . He picked up a candlestick and was removed to their living room in a different setting , at night , with candle flames lighting the faces around thep160table , a sound of silver scraping on plates , a rustle of skirts , and then a man 's voice , gentle as candlelight , rising from the shadows : " What I 'm going  --  " " Hey , look at this , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an old black suit of tails many sizes too big for him . " Take it off . Put it back . " " Okay . But I get to keep this . " It was a book , Children of the Garden , that personified the common domestic flowers , giving them human features and appendages , and names such as Betsy Bluebell . " We 'll keep it in the playroom . " " Oh , all right . But do n't leave it where Mom 'll see it . " Jerome went to a box of daguerreotypes and fading tea-colored photographsand found pictures of rural families lined up in front of farmhouses ; the farmer , bearded or with sidewhiskers , sitting in a kitchen chair ; beside him his wife , her sun- or gray-streaked hair pulled back tight , wearing a long black-sleeved dress , seemingly old enough to be the children 's grandmother ; and the children , all of them , even the babies , were big-headed and looked mature . There were pictures of houses they recognized , of Main Street as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carriage in front of Schommer 's Tavern , and several views of their own home . Jerome motioned to Charles and showed him a rear view of their house , and then put his fingertip on the attic window . " Look at this , " he said then , and wiped his forearm across another picture : a plump man in muttonchop whiskers stared up at them with the fallow and sparkling eyes of an old roue . Jerome frowned . " It 's Mr. Halvorson . " He flipped past the photographs of him and his wife , who was broad and squarejawedand looked enough like her husband to be his brother . Two of the daughters looked like her . In a portrait of the third girl , however , Jerome saw what he was looking for in the others . She was sitting at one end of the settee , an open book in her lap , a finger along her cheek , staring out with sober eyes on the world beyond ; her long hair , coiled on the settee , covering one thigh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown . " See , " Jerome said , and touched the lace dress she was wearing . " That was hers . " " So ? " " You should n't be playing with it . "  | " Why ? " " If it was hers  --  You just should n't . Look how pretty she is . " " Not any more . " " What do you mean ? " " She 's old and ugly by now , or else dead . " Jerome turned the picture over , and read , " Lydia , at the age of thirteen , in the year of our Lord , 1904 . " " See , " Charles said . " That 's even before Dad was born , and look how old he is . " Jerome was n't listening . He saw the girl running through the downstairs hall on a day as sunlit as this one , coming up the steps , her hair a shaking tangle in the sunlight , and into the playroom to the Victrola . He turned . His mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing the steps in her condition . " What did I tell you two ? Get out of here ! Get out , get out , get out ! " In August , Alpha gave birth to a daughter , whom she named Marie , after Martin 's mother , in an effort to say that that part of the past was forgotten for her . Jerome and Charles were envious of all the attention the girl got , and embarrassed by her . But Tim , who was always left out of their projects and play , would stand at her bassinet with his hands clasping and unclasping behind him , sometimes for an hour , as though she were his only hope . Martin was proud of her in the way that only the father of a daughter can be proud , and while Alpha was in the hospital he painted their bedroom pink and white and bought an expensive camera he should n't have . Alpha had always wanted a girl and was happier than she 'd been in years . The house was becoming hers . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs , to save on heat and cut down on cleaning chores , but now it was open and a major piece of frameworkin the home she was building within the house ; she put a sleeping cot , white organdy curtains , and glassed-in bookshelves she 'd got at an auction for a couple of dollars and thought she 'd never use , in the room the roll-top desk would never leave , and called it " Martin 's office and that desk 's of his . " In a battered boxp162of junk , she unearthed the shell of a turtle Martin had found , empty , along the county right-of-way when he worked on the road gang with his father the summer Emil was injured and Jerome drowned . He 'd had his father and other county employeessign it on the dome , leaving the colored whorls of its plastron clear as paint , and then filled it with cement and varnished its outside and used it as a paperweight . It was a misplaced , much-missed talisman , and she put it on the pile of papers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she write here ? She was flooded by a fluttery grayness that made her get up and go to her own upstairs room , a sewing room with an easy chair and a lamp for reading , when she wanted to relax and be away from the boys , if they were n't up here . The closets of the room held all their winter clothes out of the way , and there was so much space she was able to leave her curtain stretchers permanently set up . It was more than she 'd expected to have , in Hyatt or anywhere . She painted the cupboards in the pantry and kitchen with white enamel , and Martin put down new linoleum in every room . He trimmed the hedge around the house , all of it , down to four feet , and got blisters and sores and then hands as hard as horn from the job , which took him two weeks to complete . And then there was still a huge mountain of branches at the back of the yard . He installed an oil heater in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the downstairs on fall days without starting the furnace , and when school dismissed for the summer , he hired a neighbor , William Runyon , as a helper , and they scraped and wire-brushed and repainted the outside of the house . It was the color Alpha had always wanted her house to be  --  warm yellow , with white trim . She had a place for everything , from the rocker she 'd begged from her mother to her open-toed summer shoes , and every piece of their furniture was being put to use ; and then Martin , bless him , went out and bought a bedroom set of solid maple she 'd dreamed of owning for seven years ( " $21o , " she dashed down on an address page of her diary , to always remember . " But who cares ? " ) , which had a tall dresser for him , and a vanity with a mirror high and wide enough w satisfy even her . And still the house looked underfurnished . Which suited her fine , a sort ofp163perfection she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever underfoot . She helped Martin lay out a vegetable garden beyond the lilacs at the south of the house , and they kept the rows as straight as the planting strings , and well weeded . She canned and preserved from the middle of summer into the fall , and the shelves in the basement began to fill up . The potato bin was full . There were parsnips , kohlrabi , turnips , and rutabagas , all dipped in paraffin to preserve them , in other bins , and carrots buried under sand . She brought out the winter clothes and began to mend them . One afternoon in October she was sitting in her rocker in the alcove made by the bay window , absorbing the last of the warm sunlight before winter , and knitting a heavy cardigan for Marie , when she thought she heard a knock at the front door . Nobody in town ever came to that door . She put her work in the seat of the chair and looked into the boys ' room and found all three playing there , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down the hall to the door , and opened it . A young priest she 'd never seen before stood rocking his weight in a kind of feint on the porch . " Hello . I 'm James Russell . Just call me Father Jim . " " Oh . Hello . " " You must be Mrs. Neumiller . " " Yes , I am . " " I used to live here . " " Well , come in . Please , sir . " He stepped inside and his eyes traveled in rolling waves over every area of the entry and stairs as though following a familiar course , and stopped ; the boys had trailed after her and were at the end of the hall . " Ah , " he said , " I see you have three fine sons . " He strode past her , his billowy cassock smelling of cologne and cigarettes , and went to them and tousled their hair . " Your father 's a fine gentleman , " he said . " He taught two of my brothers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise for him . You should be proud . Have either of you older fellows made your First Communion yet ? "  | " Me , " Jerome said . " What do we mean when we say that God is all-present ? " " When we say that God is all-present we mean that He is everywhere . " " If God is everywhere , why do we not see Him ? " " Although God is everywhere , we do not see Him because He is a spirit and can not be seen with our eyes . " " Is God all-wise , all-holy , all-merciful , and all-just ? " " Yes , God is all-wise , all-holy , all-merciful , and all-just . " " Good , good . You 've learned your catechism well . " He turned to Alpha . " Do you have others ? " " A daughter , two and a half months . " " Is she asleep ? " " Yes . " " Ah , that 's too bad . I 'd Iike to bless the little darling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will he be back soon ? " " Later today . He 's gone to McCallister . " " I 'm afraid I wo n't even get a chance to see him , then , I 'm so awfully rushed . That 's disappointing . I have n't been in town since I was transferred to St. Paul , which is three years now . I 'm with the Jesuits there . I believe they thought it best if I did n't visit the family for a while . We were all very close . " He rubbed and wrung his hands as if washing them and looked toward the door . " But the family , God bless them , is gone now , so I do n't feel guilty I stopped . There 's a conference in Bismarck the Monsignorcould n't attend  --  one that might be important to the laity , by the way ; it deals with sacramentals  --  so he delegated me to go and loaned me his car ( I left it running ; I 'm already late ) , and since I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop and see the old place . Is n't it a lovely house ? " He stepped into the living room and strode around , displacing the air as none of them did , his eyes moving with such speed and restlessness he kept changing direction , turning to look behind , looking up , turning again . " You 've done very well by the old place . It 's decorated with real taste and is as neat as I can remember . The outside looks stunning , too  --  I mean the new paint job and the hedge , which I think Father let go the lastp165years . I ca n't understand why he felt compelled to go to South Dakota . The hardware store has n't worked out as he expected , not in that place , and he just suffered a second stroke . Well , God works His will , and sometimes His ways seem strange to those of us who merely stand by and watch . Edward and Jackie have left home , of course , but Dennis is still there to help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her vows  --  a surprise to us all , she seemed so involved in the arts  --  and Margaret graduated valedictorian this year . That makes five in the family so far . " He stopped at the bay window . What did he mean ? " I always liked to stand here and admire this view . Mother loved it so . She 'd look out and pray the Rosary here at night , when the children were off in bed , and before her fingers had gone a decade , you could hear a pin drop . I used to believe she put us to sleep that way . Ah , childhood ! The lilacs , the garden beyond , that oak down the road next to the Runyons '  --  somehow the arrangement is so pleasing and serene . I hope nobody ever builds on the lots to the corner . It would ruin this view . You can see past the highway all the way to Hawk 's Nest and beyond . There were supposed to have been some Indian battles there . For many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or so I 've heard , and then the Army surrounded it and starved them out . In all the years we lived here , I never once got out to see it . Is n't that a shame ? It stands nearly in the next county , you know , yet from here you can see the creases and valleys in it , especially when it 's clear like this , and those big trees at its base  --  see ? They look like pines , and surely must have been planted . Those always intrigued me . Here 's where I decided to become a priest . " He removed a handkerchief from the sleeve of his cassock , blew his nose hard , and then refolded the handkerchief , still staring out the window , and restuffed it up his sleeve . Then he started to pace again , peeking into the kitchen , the boys ' room , and through a gap in the sliding doors to the master bedroom . " I 'm sorry I 'm in such a terrible rush . I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , and I wanted so much to see Martin . " He stopped . " I 'd love to run up and look at my old room . But I 'm afraid that would really be imposing . " Alpha started to answer , hut he held up a hand . " Also , I don'tp166know if I could face it now . Patrick and I used to share the room , and we lost him in the war . " He crossed himself in a hurried way that looked involuntary . " Well , boys , remember to always honor your father and mother , do n't forget your morning prayers , and keep yourself pure , for there 's nothing more honorable in the eyes of God than purity . Now , come now , kneel down , and I 'll give you my blessing . " Jerome and Charles knelt in front of him with their hands clasped and eyes lowered , and Tim , copying them , did the same . He sketched crosses in the air above their heads and spoke the Latin three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her hospitality , again apologized for his rush , reminded her to greet Martin , and went ahead of her to the front door . The boys watched her accept his blessing , and then he jumped from the porch and ran across the lawn , out of sight , and they heard die sound of his car engine echo off a building and grow faint . Alpha leaned her shoulder against the door , thinking of priests and nuns , converts , herself and Father Schimmelpfennig , the size of Catholic families , and the way the religion could be youthful and vigorous , as shown by Father Jim , and did n't involve rosaries , religious pictures , statues , crucifixes , Sacred Hearts , or any of the visual trappings she could feel on the walls and shelves behind her  --  shadows and undusted squares , as though the Russells had just moved  --  and had come to think were a part of every Catholic 's need to believe with fidelity in the " true " faith . She wondered about his relationship with Patrick , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Jerome , and then saw , as if on shards of pink-tinged glass , Jerome , her son , crying as he had in the bathhouse , because he could n't go swimming every day of the summer and felt he should , out of duty to her ; Charles on a bed with pieces of the glass beside a leg , blood on the sheets ; Tim 's skin blistered and Indian-red while slugs the size of fists moved beneath it ; Marie trying to kick her way out of a closet , her face blue ; and whole seasons and aspects of all of her children , and other children , who 'd rise and grow up without her touch or praise or her acknowledgment that their lives as a whole werep167lived within such short and brightly illuminated early years . She turned to the boys , six open eyes she could n't deceive , and felt they 'd had a glimpse of what she 'd felt , and felt also , now , over and above that , that the Russells , as well as the Halvorsons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she was sure , too , that no matter how much she might resist it , it would only be a matter of time before they moved.  | " What is it ? " Jerome , who was seven hardly a week before this particular afternoon , narrows his pale-blue eyes and evaluates the sheet of paper . " This is a house , " he says , and places his finger at the bottom of the paper , where there 's nothing . " These are the people living in it . " His squint , critical and fierce , makes wrinkles appear beneath his blond eyebrows , and Charles copies the look , hoping it will endow him with the superior vision his brother apparently has . " I ca n't see anything . " " Naturally . It 's invisible . " Which reminds Jerome of a detail . He takes up the pen , dips it into the ink eradicator , and holds it poised above the sheet of paper , kneeling in the oak chair at the roll-top desk , in a shaft of afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angular features look even more like an old man 's , and before he lowers the pen he does a sort of waddle on the seat of the chair , settling his weight down to serious business . Charles locks his hands behind his head and rests his elbows on the writing area of the desk . He looks at Jeronte 's eyes , darkened now with concentration , at the shadow of his lashes below , at thep169downward curve of his thick , heavy lips , and then at a leaf of reflected sunlight resting in the hollow of his cheek . When Jerome 's absorbed in this way , when he practices the piano , when they play duets , or when he has to rehearse for a reading , he turns pinch-faced and pale , as if a part of him were bleeding into each task . They 've been initiated early into the theater by their parents ( not that they wanted to be ) , and are called upon to perform at club meetings and card parties and other feminine functions in Hyatt , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits or freaks . Some of their readings , from poets such as Poe , Longfellow , Kipling , and Eugene Field , are easy to memorize , because of the hobbyhorse metrics and the cymbals of rhyme , but there are the long monologues in prose , by obscure or anonymous writers , that are harder to cope with : the lyrical piece about the child whose father , so his mother has told him , is away on a business trip with the angels ; the one about the " real boy " whose freedom has recently been encroached upon ( " Aw , shucks , I been keepin ' my turtle in that ole crib . " Nasal twang ) by a baby sister ; or , with the rattling added difficulty of dialect , the piece about the Swede who 's just seen his first baseball game , nah , ja , shure . Charles emphasizes ripe words , highlights phrases for effect , plans pauses for breathing , and subdues the piece until he has it sounding the way he wants it to sound , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt look in his eyes , as if any attempt to enact what he felt could only destroy the purity of his feeling . Now he 's drawing this . Charles sinks to the floor , detaching himself from the concentration , and smells a fragrance of old raw oak that the open desk breathes into the room , so dense and enwrapping it seems to him he 's leaning against it . He closes his eyes and can distinguish other smells , more delicate and elusive , mingled with the heavily resinous smell , and they arrange themselves in layers that he attempts to see as he separates a sweetness of glue , a bitter yellow perfume he knows his mother never uses , a tang of ink , a hint of oily age similar to the smell that slips from the riffled pages of a big dictionary or old book . He opens his eyes and the sunlit room drops ceiling and walls around him.  |p170He  looks at Jerome , whose lips are compressed in a tight line as he draws , and realizes that the purpose of the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk . From the swirling oak grain he isolates the shape of an archway , a swallow in flight , a rising flame , an old man 's face , an eye ; he thinks of these as dovetailing . Then a cloud crosses the sun and the grain moves to a greater depth , the silvery highlights shift , and colors alter ; from coppery brown , rose , bronze , and gold , the grain changes to dark umber , dark brown , and black . He stands at Jerome 's side , twisting his forefinger in the hair above his ear . " Why do n't you use a color crayon ? " he asks . " Nnnn ? " Hardly a response , Jerome is so absorbed . " So I could see it . " " It would n't be any good then . " " How come ? " " Because then you could see it . " " Oh . " Charles is n't sure whether to concede to this logic , and needs information that 's more precise . He moves so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks , lying beneath each blond hair on the bulge of Jerome 's free forearm , and watches Jerome move the pen in rapid pinches of his fingers while the hand and arm lie absolutely still , and finds himself , though detachedfrom the act , participating in it in such a physical sense that a cloak of sensation covers his shoulders and then , as he moves to speak , shudders down his back . " How do you know it 's good ? " " I 'm doing it . " " But you ca n't see what you 're doing . " Jerome looks up , distracted from his task , a veil of creation clouding his eyes , and being as patient as he can be with somebodyso young , not even six , says , " Nobody can see it . It 's invisible . " " That 's what I mean ! " " I know . " A reply to stun most any literal mind into silence . Now he studies the drawing and sees that it 's complete . He prints his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puts the cap back on the bottle of ink eradicator , puts it in a pigeonhole of the desk , putsp171the pen away , and puts the blank sheet on the pile from which he took it . " What are you doing ? " Charles cries . " I 'm finished . " " Do n't put it there ! Dad 'll use it in the book . " " That 's all right . I know what it is . " " He 'll write a letter and send it away ! " " So ? They wo n't see it . " " Well , make it so they can ! " " Then he would n't send it away . " " Make it so I can see it . " " If you could , it would n't be invisible . " " Why do you want it invisible ? " " Because it 's mine . " They 'll be necessary to each other the rest of their lives ; the one with his passionate need to know and be told what everythingmeans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among elements that are invisible and his own.  | " When I was a young man and we were living on the farm near Courtenay , there were hard times . One summer it was a plague of jackrabbits , I remember . There were jackrabbits every direction you looked , hightailing it over the fields and pastures and eating up every green shoot the second it appeared . To us , they were eating up our providence , so we went after them with rifle and shotgun . I carried a twelve-gauge on the back of the tractor so much there was a groove worn in its stock where it rested on the toolbox . I learned to shoot the thing one-handed and drive the tractor with the other , although your grandpa warned me not to , and I made a little money that year ; there was a bounty of twenty-five cents on jackrabbits and if you had ten dollars in those days you were rich . I remember at the co-op elevator in Courtenay , where they paid the bounty , the carcasses were piled up one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This was when the Depression was coming on . There was a drought . The crops dried up and the blowing dust blackened the air so badly it was dark sometimes at midday . We put rugs under the doors and stuffed rags around the windows but the dust came right through the walls . It was topsoil . You could n't keep clean no matter how often you washed , and even the sugar got gray . We did n't have money to buy seed for new crops and there wasp173very little to eat . Many days , I remember , your grandma made up a big pan of johnnycake and it lasted us the three meals . There were eight of us then and your granddad did all it was possible for a man in his position to do . He kept us alive . " We had a neighbor in those days by the name of Iver Seim . " He smiles and Jerome and Charles nudge one another . When he tells his stories , he 's so transformed in the telling they 're nearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His oval face broadens at the mouth and looks round , and his eyes , bright blue and nearly circular , become enormous behind his gold-wire glasses ; he punishes his hair until curly locks of it cover his forehead ; tugs at his watch chain , at the green suspendersunder his vest , and becomes so nervous he can hardly sit . " Iver was one of the most brilliant and interesting men I 've met and he fancied himself a poet and had a good wife , but he ruined it all with drink . His motto was , There must be an easier way . ' I 'm not saying he was a lazy man ; that would n't be true . He farmed two sections of land and there was n't anybody able to keep up with him when he wanted to work , and in his spare time and at nights he was also always working away at his poetry , but he drank . He was skin and bones from worry and hard work . We never saw the lights in his house go off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse he called A Medley of the Plain . He recited stanzas of it for us now and then , but I was too young to really remember much . There was a line that went , There must be a Creator or my life would n't be going up in flames every day . ' Or something of that sort , better said . His language and ideas were generally above me then . " He had plenty of ideas , it seems , but was never able to get them off on the right foot . Or maybe he depended too much on that motto of his . I remember one time he decided to reshingle his barn . We all wondered why , since it was his house that leaked and was in such sad shape . Dad  --  your grandpa  --  offered to help him with the job , but Iver just winked and said , Wait till you see what I 've got up my sleeve , Mr. N. ' " He built a mechanical rig to lift the shingles onto the roof . It looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd use it later to lift engines out of his tractors and cars . Who knows where he got thep174materials to build it or those shingles he had ? He lived on a fertile farm in a good location and got regular checks from some place else  --  some said it was a rich uncle , others said it was his father-in-law  --  but never seemed to have a cent . He often tried to borrow from Dad and was always bartering with neighbors up and down the line for food . " His shingle-lifting boom was built out of logs and pipework and ran off the power take-off of his tractor , and must have taken him weeks to build . On the second load it tipped over  --  ' Geet out ! ' he cried  --  and tore an eave off his barn . Oh , Lord ! Those shingles sat beside that barn in stacks , with moss growing on them , for as long as I can remember . I suppose it seemed an easier way at the time to him . " He got tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was what he needed now . He bought up feed chains from broken-down threshing machines , cut the cleats in lengths to fit his gutter , and linked the chains in a series that revolved . He had to burrow the length of his barn beneath the gutter to do it , but got it going at last . This contraption also ran off the power take-off of his Case . It worked well for a while and farmers were coming from around to admire it , and the officer of an implement company in Duluth even showed up one day to check out the possibilities of mass production of it . Iver sat on his tractor taking nips from his jug and got the cleaner going like crazy , but apparently had n't put the proper sort of bracing in his burrow ; part of the barn floor collapsed . The tractor reared up and tipped on its back and pinned him by his coveralls and the cleaner kept going long enough to drag the tractor and him into the barn with a crash . ' Holy balls ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last words , but he was hardly scratched . The luck of that man ! " Your grandpa patched up the wall and the one eave above it . That barn certainly took its knocks . ' He is n't one to ask favors , ' your grandpa used to say . ' But you wish he would , before he 's in so deep you ca n't help , because he always ends up needing one . ' " He bought a dozen Shropshire sheep to keep the yard around his place looking mowed and tidy . ' It 's a bit of old England I 've got here now , is n't it ? ' he said in an accent . But he 'd neglected to fence off his garden and the sheep leveled it in a day . His wifep175liked that . We helped them out with vegetables that winter and got a lot of mutton in return . I still ca n't stand the stuff . Iver showed me this . " Martin raises his left hand and pops his cuff . " If you wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the inside of your wrist , like this , it 's less likely to get damaged , and the crystal does n't scratch up so much . " Around the Depression there were a lot of closing auctions going on . Iver was attracted to them in a way you wished he had n't been . He 'd go to one and start bidding and could n't stop . It seemed he was n't so interested in the items as in coming out on top . Again , I do n't know where he got the means . He 'd come over all liquored up and say he 'd just sold a poem , but I did n't ever see anything of his in a book or magazine or even scratched on a pad of paper , as far as that goes . I took him at his word . He drove an old Dodge truck and he 'd leave each auction loaded with so much furniture and junk you 'd wonder where he 'd put it all , and unload it at his back door as if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'd sit out and get rained on a few times . He had two or three of just about everything you can think of in just about every room of his house . When he had company , there was hardly a place to stand . There were five or six beds , as I recall it , and he and his wife did n't have any kids . She kept every piece of furniture and knickknack he brought home as clean as the day it was made . She was a hard-working , solid Scandinavian , that girl , and I never once heard her complain . " He also bought tractors . He had several makes you do n't even hear about now . They were parked all around his farmyard and he had about a dozen hidden away in an old horse barn . He claimed those were special breeds , and priceless , but I think he was actually embarrassed at the number he had . None of them would run when he needed one , of course , or if he got one going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanic , you see . When one gave out he 'd leave it sit where it was until it occurred to him what to do about it next , and there were a few he 'd plowed around so many times they were a part of the landscape . " Oh , what I could tell you about starting those old tractors of his ! The Waterloo Boy was cranked something like a Hart Parr , along the side instead of up at the front . And then there was the Rumley Oil Pull . It was cooled by oil , not water , like most , andp176had a flywheel on the order of a John Deere . You had to grab that flywheel and give it a spin with all your might , and when it finally took hold , it shot clouds of blue smoke out of a big stack under its square front and the flywheel sent you flying ! " He had an old Flour City , which was made in and named after Minneapolis , and stood on big steel wheels , six foot high or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stood to drive it . You also cranked it from there , at the back , by the platform , and the cranking spindle revolved all the while the engine was going once you got it going for good . That spindle scared me ; I figured sooner or later it was going to catch me in my crotch . Iver had fun kidding me about that and then the spindle caught him there . Not a word . The Flour City moved into the horse barn with his special breeds . " He had three or four cars he had trouble keeping on the road . There was a particular Model T he rolled three times in the course of a year . He spent his time in between tinkering on it . He had an idea on how the steering could be improved . He drove too fast , of course , and the inside of the car was always tinkling with empty liquor jars . It seemed he never went anywhere unless he was juiced . He was n't ever hurt in any of the accidents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loved to play the mandolin and sing , although he could n't do either , really , not well at all , and , my Lord , that infuriated him ! He was jealous of your grandpa because he could carry a tune ! Dad called him a misguided perfectionist . He said that Iver was probably the kind who could n't let a  --  Well , you know how you toot when you eat beans ; that he could n't do that without taking time to stop and get a good whiff of it . " One day he came running into our yard and yelled , One of my cars is on fire ! ' ' Where ? ' we asked . ' Just down the road here ! Hurry up ! ' We all took off , about six of us , counting kids , and , sure enough , there was fire coming out of the raised hood of an old Pontiac of his . He 'd thrown his shirt over the engine and the shirt was all burned up . He started scooping dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Help me ! ' he yelled to us . Most of us obliged and started throwing dirt , although we figured pretty soon this whole car would he blowing up . Ile pulled off his trousers in front of us kids and slat led what king at the the withp177those . Dad meanwhile had turned back when he saw the smoke , and now came running up with a weed sprayer filled with water and put the fire out . " ' How can I ever thank you ? ' Iver said . " ' How did it happen ? ' Dad asked . " ' Well , I cleaned the block and rocker-arm covers with gasolinethis afternoon , ' Iver said . ' I really shined her up . I used all the gasoline I had . I was coming over to ask if I could borrow some from you , so I could turn that hay of mine that got wet last week , when the car here ran out . Then I remembered I always carry a five-gallon can in the back here , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that into the tank but it would n't start , so then I siphoned some of it back out  --  I also carry a siphon hose  --  and I took off the air cleaner and poured some in the carburetor , and I guess it got slopped around . When the engine finally took hold , flames shot up . How can I ever thank you , for goodness ' sake ? ' " ' Before you thank me , ' Dad said , ' I think you better check that engine there . Your spark-plug wires will have to be replaced , at the least , and that fan belt . You got a pile of dirt all over the top of your carburetor somehow , and now this water has just made it mud . ' " ' Do you think it 'll start ? ' Iver asked . " A few weeks later I went by his house and most of the windowswere broken out and his furniture lay in the yard in a circle around it . He 'd gone on a bender and cleaned house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a penitent . And then his wife disappeared . Run off to her father , some said ; off with another Swede , according to others . I imagine Iver had bad luck with that poem of his , too . " His belongings and his farm were eventually auctioned off . All of us in the family felt too bad to go . They say that Iver ran alongside the auctioneer , trying to convince the bidders of every item 's worth , and scared people off . I saw Iver once after that . The folks and the kids were away at church and I was doing the chores alone . I was sixteen . I was walking toward the house in the dark with a bucket of milk in each hand when I heard something big in the grass . I took off for the porch spilling milk all the way , and then through the grass came this  --  Well , it was Iver allp178ragged and dirtied up and wearing a cowboy hat . He was crawlingalong on his belly . He crawled up to the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time I 'd seen an adult act like this , and I was deathly afraid . " Am I headed right ? ' he asked in a tiny voice . " ' What ? ' " Headed right . I 've been traveling this state by the stars since I struck the river 's mouth . ' " What do you mean ? ' " ' An ash can , ' he said . He had his hands like paws on the ground . " An ash can ? ' " ' Yes , Martin . Even an ash can tell a Norse from a souse . ' " Well , I had to laugh . Who knows how many times he 'd pulled that one ? But here he was , out a wife and farm and on his knees , on his belly , literally , and still trying to be his same old self , or whatever he was , and 1 thought , Here 's a man I 'd like to help . So I put down the milk and locked my knees and lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a funny voice , Thanks a lot , Martin . I 'll write that Medley yet . ' And then he ran off down the road laughing in a way I 'd never heard anybody laugh before , and hope not to hear again . " He 'd come to our house once before , on a Halloween , in that same cowboy hat and a pair of long winter underwear . He had a tractor chain around his waist with an alarm clock wired to it , and when Dad opened the door he pointed a keyhole saw at him and said , ' I 'm the Bony Granger , and I 've about had it . Put ' em up . ' Oh , Lord , Iver ! He had a pinto riding horse he called Bonehead . I keep looking for a book entitled A Medley of the Plain , or any book by Iver Seim , but I 've yet to see one to this day . In his own fashion he had a knowledge of the world in order to act the way he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just coming onto . " He 's moved to the edge of the chair and placed his hands on its arms , elbows turned out , as if to rise . Jerome and Charles move back and can feel from behind , from the couch where their mother sits embroidering on a dish towel , a current of empathy and protectiveness . Their father clears his throat and settles hi ' weight into the chair again . If he 's relaxed , his stories rise of theirp179own volition from an untroubled , indemnified , and inexhaustiblesource . " When I graduated from high school , in 1931 , there was n't money to send me through college . No money ? My Lord ! Our farm was mortgaged to the hilt , we 'd sold most of the stock , we kept a Model A going on the road with binder twine and coat hangers , and your mother and your Grandma Jones looked on us as rich . Ha ! I 'd heard so much about the money my Granddad Neumiller had I felt we should be rich , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma Neumiller needed flour or sugar from town , I 'd ride in after it on a little old bicycle with hard rubber tires that had once been Dad 's , to save on gasoline . He 'd built a cart with steel wheels that hitched behind the bike , which was an antique that once belonged to him , as I said , and he 'd bequeathed it to me and it had since passed down the line of kids . I 'd graduated to a car and now I was back on that , pulling a hundred pounds of flour behind in the steel-wheeled cart . Oh ! my knees stuck out on both sides , like this , the steel wheels squealed and creaked , and I knew everybody in the whole countryside was watching me ! Every time I got demoted to that  --  thing !  --  I 'd take the long way around from town , so your mother would n't see me in my shame . " He removes his glasses and with the back of his hand wipes a wet streak of laughter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the house : solemn ; the decorous highschoolprincipal , the parishioner who attends Mass every day , the conscientious paterfamilias with a garden in his yard and a clipped hedge around a newly painted house , which townspeople and neighbors like to look at now . " I knew it was important to your granddad that we kids get a college degree , and I figured I had to try to set an example , since I was the oldest , even if I went for only a year . There was confusionabout a baseball scholarship that I do n't want to talk about right now , and then I applied to Valley City State Teachers College and was accepted . I found a job that summer pitching bundles . You went out with a hayrack and team and loaded up the bundles of grain that had been stacked into shocks to dry , then drove to the threshing machine and pitched the bundles from the rack into its rattling feeder teeth . It was ap180chaffy , dirty inferno around that machine at the tail end of August , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , for man and hayrack and team , and I was grateful to get it . I missed Iver . He always worked hardest at threshing time . I gave your grandpa a dime on every quarter I earned for the use of the wagon and team . He was n't going to accept it but I insisted , by George ; it was his team and wagon and I made that stick . I put in two hundred hours , fifty dollars ' worth , and even taking into account your granddad 's cut , I remember going off to school that fall with the feel of a lot of money in my purse . I had one of those leather purses with a clasp lock at the top then . " I joined the National Guard because they gave you a uniform and I needed pants to wear . For most of my meals I had breakfast food with water on it . Milk was too expensive . I used to walk to the other side of town because I found a bakery that sold day-old bread for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job at a sorority , waiting table and washing dishes and floors , and had my meals there . At first I could hardly hold it down , the food was so rich . " His eyes blink and scintillate and he stares beyond them with a fixity of focus that makes them feel the past is so close he 's staring at a particular face in it . " When I was eleven and we were on the home place outside Mahomet , your grandpa bought a Golden Guernsey heifer calf . She was one of the few Golden Guernseys for miles around . She was registered . We had the papers on her . We had to transport her a hundred miles to have her serviced by a registered bull , and it took several trips to get her with calf , but it finally happened , at last , and we could feel a better future ahead , or at least I could . The calf would bring a good price and when we got back on our feet financially Dad was going to start a herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fetch the cows for the evening milking . It was one of the first nice days that spring and I could see the buildings of Mahomet and the windmills of neighbors who lived miles off . The cattle had been barned up all winter , so the pasture was heaven to them , and they 'd found a growth of grass in a swale along the creek and would n't leave it for love of God nor me . I hollered and slapped their real ends , but they 'd justp181switch their tails and step to one side . I got so mad I picked up a rock the size of a baseball and threw it into the bunch of them . The Guernsey dropped like she 'd been shot . Instantly killed . It probably could n't happen three times in this world . " The rest of them smelled death and ran for the barn , and I sat in the pasture beside her and started bawling and could n't stop ; this beautiful creature that held our hopes now gone becauseof me , her sides big with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw your grandpa coming toward me over the fields  --  " " I bet he spanked you . " " Wait , now . I want you to hear what kind of person he is . I saw him coming and wanted to run and hide , but knew I could n't hide forever , so I sat there like the stone I sat beside . Even if she 's dead , it ca n't be that important , ' he said . Yes , it could be , ' I said to him , and told him what I 'd done . You should never lose your temper , ' he said . I 've told you that , I 've warned you about it , and now you see what you reap . ' " You 're right . I expected a licking to last me the rest of my life , but instead Dad lifted me to my feet and said , Come home and eat now . You 've suffered enough . ' " He removes his glasses and lays them in his lap , where reflectionson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many good stories . At the time they seemed terribly sad , or troubling , or made me wonder about the justice on this earth , and there were a few I did n't think I 'd live through , such as the Guernsey , but I did , and now when I look back on them it seems that they happened in a way that was almost ordained . No matter how many times I think them over , or try to write them down , they always have a quality about them that language wo n't quite explain for me . When I write the book of my life , when I get around to it , that 's the way I 'm going to make them . " Goodness ! " he exclaims , and presses his fingers on his thighs and throws his head against the chair back , then grabs his glasses by an earpiece as they slip down a trouser leg away from him . " I 'm beginning to sound just about as bad as Iver Seim ! "  |p182Jerome  opens out the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on a bottom shelf , opens the top doors with a swaying-out boost and lift from Charles , and hands down from a high shelf the quart jars and one-pound coffee tins that contain their collection of pennies . He and Charles bear the jars and cans to their double bed , while Tim , small for his age , sits in silence on his cot at the side of the room , his eyes hanging on tendrils , and watches them empty the containers until the bedspreadis covered with coppery sunshine . Jerome and Charles look at the dates on the coins . They examine Abraham Lincoln . They look for dimes tossed in mistakenly by their father . They look for quarters and nickels and half dollars , too . Their hands begin to smell metallic and bright green . Tim groans from his cot . Where 's he been ? Jerome and Charles start dividing the pennies by hundreds into two equal shares , and grow tired of it ; there are too many to do . They pour the pennies from jars to cans to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bedspread and lie down and make swimming motions with their arms over the layers there . They try to dive beneath them and hurt their foreheads . They decide to count them and at rive at three thousand , licking saliva from their lips as though there 's a run on it in  --  thisp183exchange , and then Jerome tosses a handful heavenward and it spatters down on the layers of pennies spread out on the bed around them . " There are just too many ! " He starts shoveling pennies with both hands and covers Charles 's stomach the way the people at the seashore do in their father 's large green cartoon book . A big fat man here in the middle . " They 're really heavy , Jay ! " Medallions and sunlit triplicates of coins float and hover and rock on the ceiling above them . The air in the room is browngolden , and these children , for the first and only time in their lives , are as rich as princes or kings , or Father Schimmelpfennig , who buys a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old one ; it 's O.K. by their father , and not that expensive , either , he 's told them . " Then why not just buy a new one ? " Jerome asks now . " I have no idea , " Tim says . They all laugh at the imitation of their father . Jerome and Charles throw coins at Tim for speaking so boldly , and then quickly retrieve them . " Get out of here , " Jerome says to Tim , who 's examining a silvery-gray circular piece , all dull and tarnished , which is , believeit or not , a real penny . " Go wipe yourself , " Charles says . He does a raspberry and lets pennies clatter from the hand pinching his nose into a can . " Go crawl in Marie 's crib and diddle around with yourself , like last month , " Jerome says , and lays a compact and eruptive childlike fart in a jar , and then sticks the mouth of it toward Charles as they lie back on the layers of their pennies laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under their backs like the music of planets circumscribing arcs around musical spheres . Now stars are on the ceiling and the air bright-blue and tingling ; it 's extraterrestrial ! Jerome finds a dime . Well , at this moment , take it from me , these children are richer than anybody anywhere in the world will ever possibly be , except for Tim , of course , who 's turned to lie face down on his cot and is probably weeping  --  poorTim , who is n't bossy or aggressive and wants only to please , and does n't have a penny among him.  |p184Tim  hears a loud cry of Deem ! Deem ! He lowers his eyes and stirs his cereal with his spoon . His mother has bathed Marie and put her in her crib for her nap and now she 's in the pantry across the room from him , finishing up the breakfast dishes . All but his . She lets him sleep late and eat late , as he overheard her telling his father , because the day is so long for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his brothers are both in school . He is n't old enough to go yet . He 's only four . His birthday is May eighth . Deem ! The cry is louder and sounds closer , too , as if it originatesinside the wall behind and travels over his shoulder in purple shafts . Is that possible , probably or not ? He looks up and finds her studying eyes set on him in a frown . " Are you done with your breakfast already ? " " Yes . " " Do you want to go out today ? " " Yes , I do . " " Let 's get you dressed , then , and out , before he decides you 're not going to show . " He walks to the wall behind the stove , where outdoor clothes are hung on hooks , and stands as though for inspection , while she opens the door , and says , " just a minute , Donny . 11 (  --  11 he rightp185out . " There 's a cry of recognition and other noises she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool-tweed topcoat , once Jerome 's , up Tim 's arms , turns him to face her , and starts buttoning it up . She 's worried about him . Almost everybody in town calls him " the principal 's son , " and his brothers " the Neumiller boys . " How sad for him without his knowing it , or does he ? He has n't made any friends as Jerome and Charles did at his age  --  they collected them  --  and does n't seem inclined to . The only child he really likes is Susie , the Eichelburger girl across the hedge and alleyway and white barn , who 's high-strung and secretive , and every bit as friendless as he is . They drive shingles into the ground to make pens for Susie 's dolls , or count out bottle caps her father has brought back from the tavern uptown , and bury them in treasure boxes , as they call them , small tins from the ash piles up and down the alley , and are so feverish and hushed in all they do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in the Eichelburgers ' barn with all their clothes off . So Tim certainlyis precocious , I 'd say . And Susie must be lonelier than even her mother has imagined . " Should we give them both a whipping ? " Mary Eichelburger , who 'd caught them , asked . " No , I do n't think so , " I said . " Thanks . Neither do I. I 'm afraid Susie would just get to enjoying the goddamnable abuse of it . " " Goodness , you sound mad  --  or angry at me . " " Well , how would you feel if a holy terror of a two-bit Catholictown like this had screwed up one of your kids ? " She flipped away her cigarette and strode up the back steps and into her house , a heronlike waddle to her high waist , and then the door swung to with a bang , while I thought , so there 's one who feels even more outcast than I. She 's handsome , exotic , and time-attuned , and hates working for her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  beauty putting up with smart remarks  --  and there must be an even more fertile secret curled inside that " abuse of it , " huh ? Tim watched every second and aspect of it when I was breastfeedingMarie , and would say sometimes , " Mom , do all girl babies have eyes that big ? " Oh , the innocence and the duplicityp186in it ! He 'll come up when I 'm busy with housework , his eyes enlarged and dark as far as I can see into them , and say , " Rememberthe day you brought Marie home here from the hospital and laid her down on her back right on the kitchen table ? " And even though that 's what I did , he was only two and a half at the time and it 's inconceivable to me , even though I 'm his mother , that he could remember the moment so well . When I asked him about it he said , " Oh , maybe Charluss "  --  his name for Charles  --  " told me that . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk ? " he 'd ask , and then when she began to walk , " When will she talk to me ? " And lately he 's been wondering if brothers and sisters could become close enough to be friends . He never speaks directly to Marie , yet never treats her like an infant or a child , or , thank the Lord , a plaything , but more like an adult he 's waiting for to wake from sleep . He seems so mature in ways of intuition usually considered a part of the feminine mind . Should I encourage him to befriend Jimmy Ianaccona , the neighbor boy across the front , who appears outside his house in short pants and mittens , or in mother-made cowboy suits ( and once in a skirt of hers ) , looking lost and dazed inside the outdoor world shining down on him , who cries if he gets dirt on his clothes , or gets too cold , or wet , or hot , or bored , or stultified , and if he should wander a ways from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she 'll come onto the porch , a brown shawl about her narrow self , and scream , " Jiimmy ! Jiiiimmy ! " in such a desperate voice it stiffens your neck cords no matter how many times you 've heard it , or how many walls it 's come through . Her Jiiiimmy has been more than once the swimming bees of serenity 's death . When Jerome and Charles let Tim in on their roughhousing and games , he becomes so rowdy they ca n't contain him . Once they tied up his hands and feet with a jump rope and locked him inside the room with that old Victrola they keep insisting is theirs . I heard him calling out and kicking on the floor and asked Jerome what was up , before I went and saw , and he said , " Oh , nothing really . Tim just does n't belong to us . " " You be good to Donny , " I say to him . " Yes , I will . "  | " You 're his protector . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven boys and a girl , is six feet tall , with a pair of matched shoulders from my personal heaven of men , hands larger than Martin 's , and thighs and calves that pop his pants ; he holds his hands , limp , in front of his waist or chest as he walks , half flexed and tentative , as if to search out feeling in the air to guide him , and jerks his feet with high steps out of tangles nobody can see . He 's thirteen and ca n't speak , but can understand well enough what you 're up to , if spoken to as even pets and plants are spoken to , but he , being neither so tame nor unanimal , seldom is . Mrs. Ennis ushers him out of the house in the morning , or perhaps of his own volition he goes , and he wanders the streets , usually pulling an empty wagon behind him , until time for recess at the parochial school , and then stands across from the playground , in our yard , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nuns do n't want him near ; his fly is left undone and he 'll pull it out wherever the need overtakes him , and , oh , is it huge ; little girls should n't have to endure that , not yet , and on that the nuns and I are in accord , but I 've seen the barnyard habits of a lot of men , and of the animals in the barnyard , too , and know it 's natural for him to follow his instincts , but there was still the size of it , and the idea that the girls might get , terrifying or later candid , ah , that men were all that big . It came splattering out of it and foamed with rising steam , moonlightand ice and a pale leg seen . He cheers the children if there 's a game , and , when they go inside , crosses the street and tries to imitate their play ; he ca n't make the swings work , is afraid of the , ladder of the slide , and bangs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the principal , Sister Celestina , has to tell him to stop . Schoolboyssneak behind and slap his back and make him swing around , and then another slaps him from a different direction , until he 's spinning so fast he falls . They switch him with sticks and he ca n't move quite quick enough to catch one . His gums show when he laughs , so he tries not to laugh hard , but likes to , and is patsy for the simplest and most harebrained jokes of theirs , because they know if they can get hint to show his gums they'vep188got him going non-stop , a captive laugher . The Ianaccona kid found a car-flattened snake and would n't touch it , of course , but carried it around on the end of a stick for a day , and when Donny saw what it was , he went stumbling backward and hit a tree and stood there , fixed , his face a craven , unvoiced cry , as though the snake were a representation of an evil bred into all of us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing closer to his eyes , and then I stepped out the door and yelled , " Jimmy ! Your mother wants you home ! " Last winter Donny came pulling a sled down the street and stopped and stared at our pantry window , where I usually am . Tim looked out , too , and then I dressed him up and he went out and sat on the sled , no word spoken anywhere , and Donny pulled him around the streets until he asked to be taken home . Donny came with his sled the next day , and then the next , and then winter passed or capsized into spring , and he began to appear with his wagon . If Tim is n't here when I want him , or if I get anxious about him out of any of my personal fears , I 'll call him , not in dirs . Ianaccona 's pitch , but maybe in one that bothers her , for all I know , and in a few minutes he 'll appear , drawn up to the back door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's just chased and nipped his first deer . And then about a week ago when he came with the wagon , he cried , " Deem ! Deem ! " So there were possibilities of speech in him . " O.K. , " I say to Tim . He goes out the door and down the steps with me in his wake and when we appear Donny cries aloud and claps his large hands as though we 're in a movie he 's seeing that captivates . His black hair is a tousled haystack that needs rearranging and some shears , his nose is running in bubbly gluten over his lips onto his chin , and his green jacket , held at its center with a safety pin , is so small that his big veined wrists spring out of the sleeves of it . Its front is covered with mucus and drool . " Come here once , " I say , and lift Tim into the wagon , take the handkerchief from my apron and wipe Donny 's nose , his upper lip , his big chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now you take good care of Tint . " He smiles and shows broken and many-shaped gray-greenp189teeth , which must cause him terrible pain , and cries , " Yeh ! Ahyatata , Nin Neunhaour ! " Then he turns away and begins to pull , and I think again what a pity it is to put him to such a task , but what is there that he 'd like more , or more like to do , in a place and time such as this ? Tim gripped the wagon and looked from the left to the right as they rolled along . He bent and looked over the side . It was spring and the sun made a squat shadow of the wagon and the two of them . The big snowbanks had sunk beneath the ground and the grass was green in spots , circled by black-brindled crusty ice patches backed by thinning brown snow . Puddles in the road had oily rainbows spiraling over them and he was about to tell Donny to stop , thinking he saw the fat nose of a frog in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stood still , or else a toad . A bird like a duck it landed so fast , a robin , hopped across the Eichelburgers ' lawn after it came down past them . He liked Donny 's smell . It was like his dad 's sweat and pee and old bread all mixed up together . And then Donny made a turn that meant he was taking the long trip around the lake , where blue ice would be floating in big blocks that banged and bobbed . Good . Winter made Tim weary of the indoors , and he liked the nice rattly feel of the wagon under his rump , titabum . They passed the Congregational Church on the corner , with moss growing on its concrete steps . Nobody ever went there . Why did n't they take it down or give it to somebody who could use it for whatever they needed it for ? Could you live in a church ? The next house was Mrs. Liffert 's , and it would take Donny fifty-eight steps or so to reach it . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his brothers ' Lincoln Logs , unless they 'd hidden them again , or figure out how their Victrola worked , or learn to shoot marbles by flipping a thumb , thuk , the way they did . Then he could go behind the lilacs , where nobody would see , and practice throwing a ball from the croquet set . He did n't know where they kept their baseballs or softballs , and they said he threw like a girl . Mary I.ilfert , the widow whose three sons have entered the Marines instead of the priesthood , where she 'd prayed all threep190would find their vocation , the gray-haired lady who can be seen each spring spading her garden up in fishing waders , watches from her window as Tim and Donny pass , and makes a sign of the cross . Lord have mercy on that Alpha Neumiller 's soul , she thinks . Any mother who 'd let her kid out with an animal like that should have her head looked at . And maybe the kid could use it , too . He sure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May eighth . And then Jerome and Charles came into her yard when she was away just last spring , while Wilhomena was watching , and slashed down her flowers , every last one , with swords they 'd made of wood lath . She could feature Charles doing it , but Jerome was the perfect model of an altar boy , who made you wonder after all if there was such a bugaboo as original sin . Their mother had made them come and apologize , but that did n't make her feel any better about the woman , or bring back her flowers  --  Father was always so complimentary about her sidealtararrangements  --  and as they left the yard , she heard Jerome say , " I might , if she bothered Mom again . " What ? Level her flowers with their laths ? What had she done to her in the first place , other than give her the cold eye or shoulder , perhaps , for being such an obvious Lutheran ? Where was that Ennis taking him now ? What did they do on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women in town thought of her as so devoted to her devotions to the Blessed Virgin , she could n't ask . She 'd have to get.Tim and his brothers over to her house somehow ( date bread ? hearts ?  --  potato pancakes , like Mrs. Glick ? ) and see that they had their catechism down pat . Just being around a non-Catholic like her could absorb it right out of their heads . Why did n't any children ever visit her in her house ? Watching from the rectory across the street , the housekeeperand cook for Father Schimmelpfennig , Wiihomena Noedler , sighs and makes the sign of the cross , and whispers , in German , Bless them both , poor Donny , poor Tim ; Tim who came to the rectory last spring and knocked on the door so politely she did n't hear at first , and when she did , and opened it , expecting a note from his mother , as was often the case , he marched up into the porch next to her , and cried , " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And then went over top191Mrs . Liffert 's , on to the Pete Schommers ' , and on and on to every house on this side of town until his mother caught up with him and dragged him home by the collar of his coat . When Father heard about it , he gave her a silver dollar to send to Tim on his day ; and during her vacation , and on visits to other rectories , she told the story every chance she had , she found it so amusing . She did n't get to gossip or talk much here in Hyatt , because everybody was convinced she repeated everything to Father , who compared it to what he 'd heard in the confessional and seen in the collection box . She told the story so many times it became a recital , and then she thought of Tim walking from house to house , where some of the people were strangers to him , or people he 'd seen only in church or on the street , and announcinghis birthday as though it were as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never told the story again . Bless them both . They are strangers to us , the two of them , Tim as much as Donny , though both are familiar to us , and the worst of it is that Donny , for as long as he 's lived as one , does n't know that he is , and that Tim , at his age , already does , and is living as one . I bow my head . Teach me poverty of spirit and let me learn to love those of yours not so obviously blessed as Father . Help me to accept my life as a nun in everyday clothes . There 's a flash of another building front , an outhouse , the sprouting shimmer of lilacs along Mrs. Glick 's light side of the street , the water tower , weeds crushing under Donny 's shoes , and Tim 's eyes keep step with each step Donny takes , until Tim believes that he 's Donny and making Donny walk and the wagon move the way they do , while Donny imagines Tim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim wears , as though Tim had the entire bundle trunk of them on his back at one time , a fat bug with shining wrappings around him , a lightningbug in his hand . Deem . The wagon moves and the two strangers travel over sunlight on the storehouse of the earth that cushions theirs and everybody else 's cloud-capped , manylamentedfears and furtive , futile fantasies of being alive at times in the spiraled intertwinings of time and place , in this all-alive time of life we live inside , today , today chimes , like a handwroughtold mantclshclf clock : ching.  |p192It  was impossible for them to reconcile their mother 's feelings about the attic . She did n't mind the basement one bit . There was no floor in the basement , Mother . It was just bare dirt with planks put down over the dirt to form paths .

One of the paths of plank led to the furnace and the pile of clinkers in the corner ( plus that old coal bucket we lugged paired-up ) , and another to the potato bin , where my brothers and I were sent twice a week to sort through the smelly potatoes , picking out the best for meals , tossing aside the ones that gave way in our hands and sent smell through our skin to the center of smell , trying to forget about those , and taking pains not to touch the sprouts that grew out of the eyes of some and wove a network of white tubers over the succulent pile.  |p193Another  led to a set of shelves lined with jars of vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusty jars , with their contents looking out of them ( some spoiling , ringing the lids with crystals , or forming snowstorms of mold behind Mason on their insides ) , reminded Jerome of a Horror Comics story in which a woman chopped up and canned her husband and was finally caught , but just barely , when somebody went into her basement to fix a leak and noticed an eyeball in some fruit . He and Charles and Tim go down twice a week from the afternoon sunlight of the large and airy uptown house , down to these shelves lined with jars by their mother , with their mother , and are administered cod-liver oil in or out or on our honor in our mouth . And when the spoon cut the corners and tasted of August lakes , arched darkness , vaulted space , and foam over the ribs at the back of the throat , and I saw the shining insides of a fish 's belly spilling in a flash the way her insides must have spilled on the day I was born or the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their shoes just behind me , before I was , as I feared that I 'd be  --  blee-blee-bleeblee !  --  bedevoured : Bea devoured this ole crystal pistol 's BBs , beeee bee , wee tea pea , bditt !

And this place our mother did n't mind one bit , or so it seems now , or was then , once , or is so forever in our present-day eyes.  |p194Al|pha  's spirit was crippled by the injustice of it . Charles had turned six and was dying . After a winter of illnesses , he 'd developeddouble pneumonia , and when he was rushed by car to the McCallister hospital , a doctor told Martin that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worsened . It was nearly impossible to get penicillin , the new antibiotic they were trying on him , in this underpopulated part of this underpopulated state , and if there was another blizzard like the one last week , the shipments would n't get through . Already the roads to McCallister were all but impassable  --  the plowed banks piled higher than a car top most of the way , with only a single lane opened in the worst places  --  and there was no working airportat McCall ister , which was the only town in the three-county area with a hospital . The hospital 's oxygen tent , its only one , had to be shared with other patients . Charles had received the last rites of the Church . The probability of his death had invaded her , weighted her , moved into the marrow of her bones until she was so heavy with it she hated the details of each day , beginning with the sun ; she did n't want to get out of bed , or fix meals , or take care of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mark cooing orp195crying , or the sound of the children 's voices when the parochial school recessed , infuriated her so much that tears would sting and kindle at her eyes ' rim . All she wanted to do was stand at the bay window , as now , and stare out at the snow ; it was mounded four feet high in the tangle of lilac stems ; the wind had eroded a corrugated bank of it along the foundation ; streamers of it were traveling at an angle across the yard , up and down drifts , and filling in a cave Jerome and Tim had dug . She wanted to go there and hide . He 'd been the easiest to raise , and the most difficult . He seemed hardier and less vulnerable than Tim or Jerome , and there was an incident , two days after his second birthday , that was so typical of him she recorded it in his baby book ; Jerome was crying about some internal loss , or something eternally lost to him , when Charles said in his most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And when Jerome did n't respond to this , he came to her and said , " I never cry , do I , Mama ? " He seldom cried and was n't prone to tantrums , though if one overtook him it was a day before he recovered . He was fearless and driven to frightening acts ; he climbed the water tower when he was five , a hundred feet to its top , and then walked around the catwalk on a dare from below , leaping the open trap door as he did . He preferred to assess a subject on his own , to observe and listen and read rather than bother you with questions . And his face was more mature than other children 's , the future person that would emerge already evident around his lips and in his eyes . His eyes . Each day deepening with their own secrets . So bright blue . There were times when he seemed to be considering everything and everybody about him while merely going through the motions of play , the quality she watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one she feared the most , too . Was it like her ? What was he thinking then ? Could he have known this was coming ? Impossible . An impossible , horrible thought . Hers . All she 'd been able to do when he was home was feed him orange juice and ice cream and aspirin mashed up in honey , change his bedclothes when they were damp with sweat , give him alcohol rubs , or help with the bedpan . Jerome and Tim were as silent around him as if a stranger had appeared in hisp196bed . What did they sense ? She 'd been so distant and abrupt with them lately they stayed upstairs , relearning one another 's limits and likes , or moved around the house with hesitance , guilty and apologetic , as if they 'd done her great harm . She had no words to comfort them . All her energies were centered on Charles , and to expend them on anybody else , even Martin , seemed to diminishhis strength . She was able to visit him only once a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she did n't drive still , and there was seldom a sitter available for the three separate sets of visiting hours that divided and measured her day . If the Rynersons were still in town , Lou would come with her children and sit ( it seemed everybody available had children ) , with no fears of them getting what Charles had , but the Rynersons had moved on to a better job near Minot in the fall . Old friends gone , too . Martin made it for all the visiting hours  --  as principal of the high school , he could come and go as he pleased , especially in this situation  --  and she resented his freedom and the position that assured him he 'd be free . She resented his maleness , his patience , his faith , everything that made him who he was , and could hardly bear to talk to him . Unless they were speaking about Charles  --  painful , dragged-out phrases that made them both afraid to look at one another  --  their conversations were fencing and monosyllabic , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two . " Or , " How was your day ? " " Fine . Yours ? " " Fine . " " The kids ? " " Fine . " Or , " Good night . " " Good night . " He 'll take her hand and stare at her in silence , his large eyes widening  --  with commiseration ? helplessness ? guilt ? what ?  --  until he looks so pitiful that , even though a moment before she felt like unburdening herself to him , she 'll have to turn and walk out of the room . I need something physical , she wanted to tell him , not sympathy.  |p197When  she went to the hospital and saw where they 'd put Charles , in an oversized metal-slatted crib covered with a plastic tent , he looked so reduced , bluish , and dehumanized through the crinkled and tinted plastic , she had to leave the room until she got control of herself . Did he know that ? In a recurring dream she sees him in his own crib , the one he grew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she stands above and watches , he grows smaller and smaller , and at the final gray line , just before he disappears into death , she feels him return inside her and wakes tense on the bed with the cold dark room around her , afraid that if she moves she 'll kill them both . One day when he was home he became incoherent , distant and feverish , his eyes brimming over with an inner vision , and began babbling along in a naked way about nuns scrubbing him in a wooden washtub , silver wires above in the air , and stickmen made of colored tubes chasing him with a shadowy ark  --  while she swabbed at his face with a washcloth , wanting to shake him or slap him until he talked sense , or hold him so tight he could n't speak , or put on her coat and walk out and never return . Then Martin came from school and she told him the boy was ill beyond her powers to nurse or comfort him , and if this kept up she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat on the edge of his bed , and took his hand . " Charlie , " he said . " It 's Dad . Are you awake ? " " Uh-huh . " " How do you feel ? " " Pretty good . " " Do you want to go to the hospital ? " " Oh , no . No , I do n't need to . I feel better now . " " You 're sure ? " " Oh , yes . " But about twelve o'clock that night they heard him calling , " Dad , Dad , " and ran to his room . " I 'm here , " Martin said . " What is it ? " " I think I was wrong . " " What do you mean ? " " You better take me to the hospital . " She went to him and placed her mouth on his forehead to test his temperature and his fever against her lips was like a sun.  |p198Martin  went out and warmed up the car  --  he 'd have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk Marie in the car in this cold  --  and then they wrapped Charles in quilts and rugs , and as she was tucking him into the front seat with the exhaust and cold air fuming around her , she said , " Now , hurry up and get well , so you can come home quick , do you hear ? " " Am I coming home ? " he asked . " Of course you are ! " But the way he asked the question would be imprinted on her mind forever in a roseate glow ; straightforward , without fear or self-pity , as if he simply wanted to know the truth . And what could she say to him but " Of course , of course , of course " it was all she could say . His condition got so critical the doctor called Father Schimmelpfennig , the only person in town besides Dr. Koenig with a phone , and he picked up Martin at school and then came to the house in his black car and drove them on in to McCallister . Charles 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consciousness as they watched . They tried to talk to hirn , and then Father sighed , removed his black overcoat , took out a purple stole , kissed the gold cross embroidered at its center , put it on , and stood over the crib . " Charles ? Charles ? " he kept repeating in his heavy German accent , which made it sound nearly like " chalice . " " Charles ? " " Yes . " Finally . A dry whisper like the rustle of weeds . " Have you been a good boy , Charles ? " " What ? " " Have you been a good boy ? Have you done any bad tings , committed any bad sins ? " There was an unintelligible reply . " Do you have anyting you 'd like to tell me , confess ? Like in the confessional ? " " Finn ? " " Do you have anyting you 'd like to tell me ? " " Uh-huh . " He put his ear close to Charles . " You can say it . Nobody will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . " Father paled , glanced at them to see if they 'd heard , and thenp199took out a prayer book and a leather kit with a pyx in it , and bent over Charles and began murmuring in Latin and applying the oil of extreme unction , and she walked out to the hall , half blinded by a chrism of tears , blundered into a rest room , the wrong one , and vomited up her stomach into a urinal where hair and paper matches lay curled . If she could believe in the Catholic Church , which defined the character of God and gave Him substance , perhaps she could , like Martin , believe in God Himself and be united with him in a further way , and bear all this with more equanimity and selfcontrol . He carried his rosary everywhere , even to school in his suit pocket , and there were nights when she 'd seen him take it to bed . The Neumillers , for such a large family , were closely attuned to one another 's needs and had grown up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the protective mantle of Martin 's father , but because of the religion they shared and could talk openly about . When she was younger and went to church , it was sometimes alone , or else with the neighbors ; her mother hardly ever attendeda service , and the only time her father referred to a deity of any sort was during a natural disaster , a personal setback , or in a moment of terrible anger or pain , when he cursed God as though He were a hired man , a dimwitted , hairy , incompetent one , sitting in the same room with him . Which was as reasonable a tack to take as any , by God . God . Ha ! You clumsy , ignorant , unfair sonofabitch ! There . Her tears opened paths and open beams to the grief in her . When she was a child , she used to sit in the door of the haymow and watch as it began to get dark , while below her , in the barn , she could hear the calves baaing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clash of a bucket , footsteps , and the muffled voice of her father as he did the chores . The chicken coop was below her , across the lane from the barn , and suddenly , at a certain stage of darkness , chickens , white blurs , would appear from the brush , from the wheat field , from the pasture on the other side of the road , and begin moving toward the coop as though drawn to a magnet , some of them running , catching up to others and frightening them into a run , some moving slowerp200through the darkness , alone . Watching them , listening to her father murmuring to the animals below , she was filled with peace and , for some reason , a sadness that displaced the peace . Then the windows of the house lit , her mother stepped out and called , " Alpha ! Supper ! Ed ! Elling ! Conrad ! Come and eat now ! " There was such calm and simplicity in it , yet such an urgency , too , and she ran toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the kerosene lamps , a light with the added dimension of smell , the serenity of her mother as she moved about the room , testing the food on the cookstove , setting plates and silverware at their places at the table , and dipping and bending and stepping back as though in relation to them all and this moment , which would come soon , in Hannaford or Dazey or Cooperstown or Wallum or Casselton , or even in that shaky little place of theirs outside Courtenay , and the fitting together of the sterilized pieces of the separator , so it would be ready when Daddy and Elling came with the milk . The steaminess of the cookstove at that hour . Why do n't I , my mother 's daughter , have a soothing effect on my children ? On Charles ? If Mama were here , she 'd uphold all of us here now , just as her will within the walls of a house kept those houses from collapsing clown around us , it felt . It 's inconceivableto me that I 'm a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die . Could he ? Here at the window in this empty-seeming house , on its sill a skin of dust . What are the reasons for death , its cause ? Can its course be altered ? All those graceful clouds shaped like fish , like leaping deer and flying geese , get drawn down with the sun as if to slaughter . On the sill the skin of dust . Of my already dead son ? My grandfather ? My brother ? Oh , Jerome , remember the relationshipwe had ! Where are the bonds that bound us together , now that you 're earth ? Who in the face of death can hold himself tethered ? Do the dead forget we sometimes did n't love them , as we forget ? In our lives going on ahead at moving speed ? The least death should bring is a mindless kind of limbo , as the Church calls it , where there 'd be no consciousness of want or pain . On the window an array of my breath . I 've hated enough to stake ap201ghost of myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I decided my disposition toward me and other lives and the ties that reach out and return and unite us , but how can I be who I am with my face gone and part of the winds again ? Because I 'm alive , I 'm my life , I thought , and it was a lie . Lord , where are the ends of this life of yours ? My sight extends to the edge of Hawk 's Nest and stops . What 's on the other side , where I 've never been , bear over the mountain again , either , sir ? A perpetual field ? A golden green tree ? A fledgling weaned from flint , a feather of faith ? My hate at all the lessons I have n't learned and the places I 'll never see empties my heart . And what 's it ? A piece of my anatomy ? Who gave names to pieces of me , as Mama gave to the unprotected frame around it all , the chrysalis of Alpha for eternity ? Only Christ could fill me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long-awaited hour , and if I had Him , I 'd give up my life and be this dust , I 'd die for Charles , if it were in my power . Beyond the bay window , the yard came into focus , growing dark , the wind risen now , the snow swirling higher into the air in streaking wings . There was a gray shape beyond the lilac stems . It moved toward her , growing larger and more dense at the edge of the window , and then she looked up , her eyes adjusted , and she was staring into a reflection of Martin 's face . " Alpha ? " he said tentatively . " It 's time I made supper . " He watched her walk on rigid legs into the kitchen , and then stepped up to the window , which faced east , in the direction of McCallister , and was frosted at the level of his chest from her breath . He could n't blame her for avoiding him . His thoughts were base and vile . He was horny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All through their marriage , he 'd hardly looked at other women , not so much an indication of his moral character as a sign of his love ; he was so immersed in her and making her happy he had no time to look . But lately , at school , he 'd begun to notice the development of his female students , the delicacy of their hands and fingers , the shape and size of their breasts , the breadth of their hips , their bare legs , and the curve of their buttocks against their skirts , and once when he was at the blackboard , mechanically writing out all algebraic equation while most of hisp202mind hovered over an image of Alpha , of her at home alone , nursing the boy , trying at the same time to care for the other children and keep up with her everyday chores , he found himself in the center of a dead silence , the entire class staring at him while he stared between the parted legs of Carol Hahn , a redheadwhose skirt had slipped above her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feigned illness ( and after catching himself at that , he felt ill ) and dismissed the class for the day . The graver Charles 's condition became , the more his own needs narrowed to sex , it seemed , as if there were a balance to be achieved in this disparity , and Alpha apparently sensed it ; there were times when she looked like she wanted to talk , but the second he came close she 'd turn and walk away , out of the room , as if in disgust . He 'd tried everything he could to keep his mind off those areas of her  --  novel-reading , prayer , meditation on the Blessed Virgin and the Trinity , cold showers , chopping wood , no pepper on his food  --  everything . Good Lord , he 'd even started carrying a rosary to bed with him ! The night he got home from taking Charles to the hospital , after he 'd told Alpha what the doctor had said , and after they 'd talked and tried to reassure one another , they got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really want to be touched now , " she whispered  --  sleepless , tossing in anxiety under the covers , and then their legs touched , she turned , and he fell on her like an animal and could n't use the whole of it it was so hard . - Since then , it seemed to shame her to have him close . This morning before the children were up , when they were at the breakfast table , he was picking at a grapefruit , trying to decide whether to mention to her what had happened at the hospital the day before , when she said , " The crisis should come today , should n't it ? " " Or tomorrow , he said . " " He 'll call and let us know ? " " He 'll call Father . " " And we 'll leave right away ? " " Of course , dear . " And with those words , he knew he could never tell her , no matter what . She was staring into her coffee cup , and it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a train or ap203bus , and he realized again how divided her face was , and how that enhanced her beauty of delicate lines . Charles had her cheekbones , her nose , her lips , sharply outlined , the upper curved like a crossbow , the lower full and sensual  --  The throb of an erection tightened his pants , and in a moment of horrible revelation  --  her eyes were cast down , showing violet lids , and her face pale  --  he saw her as the corpse of Charles . " Alpha ! " he cried . " You 've got to eat ! " She got up and left the table . Her grief was dynamic , even when expressed in anger , and she was always busy , angrily busy , working to ease her grief . His sat in him like a stone . He hated to speak , to eat , to perform the simplest task in her presence , because he knew his actions would expose his hidden feelings , as hers did , and reveal his guilt , lack of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and was trying to cover up by carrying a rosary everywhere  --  his growing conviction that there was no God , beneficent or otherwise , by Lord  --  and because he knew it agonized her and made her even more angry , now that Charles was near death , to see unimpeded life in anybody else . Since he 'd carried Charles into the hospital and left him there , he felt responsible for the way she was acting , and this , in the entrapping logic of emotions , made him feel responsible for the illness to begin with . And what if Charles died ? He chewed on his upper lip , which was cracked from the heat of the house , and pushed his glasses up to grip the bridge of his nose ; he had n't known you could n't enter a child 's helplessness with all the skills of adulthood , and make him whole , but had to stand off with the knowledge adulthood brings , helpless , and watch the child suffer and hope that your hopes for him touched another source and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps he was n't a good parent . He thought he heard the baby crying . He listened for her voice , for Alpha 's footsteps going into her bedroom , but had imagined the sound . He massagedthe bridge of his nose until the wailing waves were gone , and then let his glasses fall back in place . Whenever anybody asked him who his favorite was among the children , he said , " Whichever one is sick or in trouble , that 's my favorite ; that 's the one that needs me the most . " But he was inp204such fear for Charles 's life he could hardly bear to bring him to mind , much less lend him emotional support , and the minute he walked out of the hospital he could n't even picture the boy 's face . Sometimes he 'd see for an instant , as if stopped in an eruptive exposure of lighted surprise , a vivid detail that made his breath catch ; a nose with a plastic tube in one nostril , enlarged ; a white profile with its eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hospital alcohol and ether ) ; a buttockhoneycombed and bleeding from needles ; a broken bony forearm on the velvet of a coffin ; an ivory head levitated against black . That was how he saw his son . And once in a moment of extreme stress , when the tension threatened to deprive him of the power to reason , he found himself calculating how much more money they 'd have if Charles died . He looked at the white oval of his face on the window , looked into its eyes , beyond them to the outside , and felt a chill branch in patterns of lines over his back ; loose snow was rising in columns and pillars that swayed and bent in every direction , collapsed , rose in another place , and went whirling toward the southwest out of sight , a blizzard warning . If one of those hits this window , he thought , Chuck will die , and then a tall enlivenedsheet , taller than the electrical wires , with lacy streamers coiling along its outer edge , came speeding toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , No , it means he wo n't ! it swept past the lilacs and hit the window with such force the house rocked . He clung to the rosary in his pocket . What was he doing ? He saw a sheet being pulled over a face , a mound of dirt on snow , a yellowish tonic , fear , an oval at the bottom of the grave , and heard voices , his and Charles 's , laughing in a closed space . Yesterday Charles was more lucid , and talked about the other boys , the recent snow , the sled they got for Christmas , a long one that could hold three , about school and some of his friends , and then said in a quavery voice , " Dad , what do I have that 's so bad ? " " Pneumonia . " " What 's that ? " " Oh , sort of like bronchitis , only deeper in the lungs . Morep205fluid , I guess . " " How do you spell it ? " " P-n-e  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why a P ? " " It 's Greek , I believe . " " Hard to learn ? " " P-n-e-u-m-o-n-i-a . " " Oh ! " Charles said . " Is it pretty ? " " Pretty pretty . Why the P ? " " I guess it 's Greek , I said . " " It 's Greek to me . " " Oh , you ! " " Greek , GREEK , greek , Greek , " Charles was grunting and creaking , as though mesmerized by the word and acting out its meaning in the air . " Where 's the P ? " he asked . " What do you mean ? " " Where did it go ? " " At the front of the word ? " " No , where did it go , Dad ? " " It went in hiding ! " " It did ? " " It went pee-moniaing ! " " Dad , stop ! " " Pneumoniaing ? " " I 'll have to cough ! " " Does it hurt ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Up pneumonia ? " " Or have to cough . " " Can you hang on ? " " Yes , I guess I will . " " Good boy ! " " Where 's the P ? " he asked again . " The P in pneumonia or the P in hiding or the P in me ? " " ' The P in me ! "  | " That 's the fluid . " " That 's what I thought ! " " I 'll cough for you . Blark ! Hrgh ! Krouf ! " " It keeps killing my breath . " " Hecka , hoofth ! " " My pee in me , too ! " They laughed and Martin bared his teeth and did a clutching grab at his belly with both hands and shook it up and down like a jiggly Santa Claus . Charles laughed harder and then started to cough and the cough would n't stop ; it went on until he was choking and fighting for breath so badly Martin had to run for a nurse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face was blue and he was unconscious , having convulsions . If Charles died , it would be his fault . He heard pattery footsteps behind him  --  Alpha 's when she was determined or in a fury  --  and turned ; she stopped , her face tense and her eyes feverish-looking ( was she also getting sick ? ) and empty of expression . " Father Schimmelpfennig is here , " she said . " They say it 's time . " When he thinks of his parents , which is seldom now , he thinks of them as the monarchs of a kingdom he once visited in a dream ; his mother wears a full-length dress , flaming red ( though when he sees her back from a distance it 's a brown tweedlike coat ) , whose color increases the humming in his ears , and never shows more than her profile , like the queen on a playing card . His father has on a fur cap with fur earflaps turned up like halfmoons , and carries a broom or a crozier in one hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ( Charles observes this with interest but without puzzlement or surprise ) the squeaking of a rubber mouse . What is it he 's trying to say , Charles wonders , and sees himself older , with his father 's face , at a table , extricating needles from his head of hair with pain . When his real father , looming moonlike over the bed , speaks to him from his real face , it 's as difficult to understand ; his ears seem sealed with cellophane that vibrates with every outside sound . " Herzz verritzz swowoza bee . "  | " Brrrodj a deezzz . " His own voice is a dampened hum at the center of his head , and his lips , split by fever , taste like coins turning green . His bones are ice and the ice is wrapped with layers of flesh that burn but have no effect . His brain is a fluid that exerts pressure at the base of his nose and occasionally leaks from it , or runs rawly down his throat , and puts pressure behind his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain constricting his chest strangles the air he breathes , and the shallow breaths he takes beneath the pain are becoming more shallow and rapid each hour . He has no center . When he opens an eye , he might be looking up from his stomach or out a knee . Sometimes he 's the size of a thimble , and at other times so enormous , a toe of his could cover a city . One day his arms , which are either too heavy or too light , were gone from him for a while . Where ? His illness is a sea and others are on land , unreachable . They materialize beside him at a great height and he stares up at them from beneath rocking water while their images sway with the movement of the water he sees them through ( as their mouths move ) and his body rocks beneath , as if bows saw on strings that flow through him from the firmament . The nurse arrives with a hypodermic the size of a pine tree , turns him on his stomach ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she drives it through his back the white-haired man across the hall screams again . Or was the hypodermic a spinal for him ? Charles turns , or imagines he turns , and it 's night once more . His father appears , his mother appears ; they float and rock outside the bright , burning layers of fever that enwrap him like tinfoil , in a fragile , metallic grip , and a cold wet hand spans his forehead . Yes ? Yes ? They disappear into a brightness like the sun , and he sees a player piano , shining , crystalline , made of ice or glass . Jingle ping tink-tink . Jingle ping . There 's a pain above his left eye like an embedded ax . His parents appear again and confront him with a phenomenon that makes no sense : there are , after all , other people in the world besides him , real people , and they 're alive . They 're his mother and father . Why are they so happy , then ? They smile and talk , showing their teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elongated , blurred and haloed in yellow , and smaller ,  |p208as  if seen through a tube . Their voices buzz and vibrate in his ears and then go away . A blue numeral two bends and unbends where they were . They appear again , smiling and talking , jingle ping . Yes ? Yes ? To reach their sanctuary , he has to lift himself upward , rising on an elevator of his will , and hold his body on the sea 's surface with all his strength . He grips the bedclothes and turns his parched corneas on them . Only his father is there . It 's as if Charles has entered a house in the night , one he 's never seen before , has found his way to the living room and in a brilliance fed by outside whirs and hums has fulfilled fate 's appointment ( Dad ! Dad ! ) with the right man . What 's he doing here , he wonders , and feels his strength leave as he descends beneath the sea of sickness again , deeper than before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his real voice , and lifts himself once more , for the last time , it seems , and holds himself on the surface until his father says something that makes him laugh ; the laughter turns to a cough that splits his chest , breaks the ice of his bones , and drives splinters into his flesh until blackness comes . He 'd rather be alone . Above his left eye ( the other stays closed ) , a bright disc , which might be a ceiling light , pulses and burns . It seems the last power he has to contend with . He pleads with it to move  --  it wo n't  --  or go out . Even when he closes his eye , it clings to his lid , expanding and contracting , changing colors , to a profile , a queen , a circle of icy piano keys . If he could deal with the light or the profile ( now a numeral he 's seen perform in this same way ) , he 'd be at peace , because this is n't an ordinary day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaviness , like honey and salt water , rising in him , and though it hurts him to breathe it more than any other phase of his illness has hurt him , he breathes it deeply and evenly , trying to drown . Then he 's chewing bubble gum . His jaws move from side to side in a soft , erotic , cowlike mastication . He 's home again , in bed , asleep , yet not asleep ; his eyelids are transparent gems . He sees there 's nothing beyond the bedroom curtains , no yard or hedge or houses or countryside , only a shading of light blue , like sky , and as his jaws move he hears a sound between his ears like the shuddering roar of a waterfall heard front a distance , rising in volume each time his mouth opens wide . I le chews the bedclothes . The curtains blow iic and coven the bed . I le chews then ,  |p209The  jaws move farther apart each time , the cascading roar increases , closer , while the jaws work at the curtains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewing everything within reach  --  a dresser , a nightstand ( which turn elastic like the bedclothes and curtains ) , a closet , a wall ; and when the sunlight , blue in color , pours into the room , they begin chewing it . Then they move off and change , become otherworldly , impersonal , but still remain a part of him and continue to chew with ceaseless and increasing violence , rising as high as the house , slamming down hard , higher , hard , and then they turn , turn again as if seeking direction , turn and start toward him . He tries to get out of bed but the curtains cover his legs , and now are as heavy as sand on him . The jaws , flying apart in bites so wide they disappear awhile , reach the edge of the mattress and get a bite of it . Hot breath . He makes an effort to move , a final one , using the last of his remaining strength , the ration he 's held in reserve , and breaks free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chilling blue air , and sees a mirror image of his body , tiny as a doll , heading toward a black hole in the shining universe , a blue baby blue in the night as he spins out past constellations of echoing stars and comes back on a separate trajectory into his own silence again . The doctor drew away from the crib and straightened , and Charles 's reflection slipped off the round mirror strapped to his forehead . " His fever 's broken , " the doctor said . " He 's going to be all right . "  |p210When  I completed my second year of parochial school , I was eligible , as Jerome had often told me , to become a member of the club that met in secret in the Black Forest , or so the members called it , a name picked up from some adult conversation most likely , most likely by Douglas Kuntz ; it was a quarter block of swampy lowland that had been left to itself over the years and now held the heaviest concentration of shade trees and brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the playing fields of the parochial school , with a stone wall a foot high around it , bordered so close on the Black Forest that lilacs dropped their blossoms onto the end of the wall my classmates and I passed every day . We never entered the Forest , though ; it was forbiddenby the Sisters , and once when I was caught there by one , merely to have a look and not testing my limits , I received a whipping with a switch torn from a tree ( " Do n't ever let me know what 's happened to you at school , expecting sympathy , " my father often told us , " because from my experience you probablydeserved what you got , and then some , and just might get more from me " ) . The Sisters knew what could happen behind bushes , of course , but claimed the Black Forest was off-limits because it belonged to Orville Sanderson , a bachelor who drank too much , had a foul tongue , and hated cIiildtcu  --  perhaps fromp211all those years of hearing recess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and had been known to chase them for blocks if he found them on his property . I followed Jerome out our drive , across the street , and down the alley , carrying an " offering " for each of the club officers , as I 'd been told to . We passed the end of Wheaton 's garden , where seed packages were tacked to laths and straight rows of green were lining up above the loam behind the laths and paths crossed , passed the goal line of the parochial school 's footballsoftballfield , and entered the Black Forest . I could see to my left , through breaks in its leafage , the rotten posts and sagging squares of the wire fence that restrained its advance on the alley ; the brick back of the school , the back of the church , the back of the rectory ; and to my right , the boulders of the low wall . A membranous network of leaf shadow slid over Jerome 's hair and down his back as he knocked aside the filaments that spiders strung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our efforts to dissuade them , and then the shadow stilled in place . We were at a clearing 's edge , a small dirt-packed one , and on the other side , the trunk of a dead tree , barkless , its surface smooth as skin and silvery-gray , glowed in the shadowy foliage . " Chockowah , " my brother said . A password ? Beyond the dead tree was a long latticework trellis , eight feet tall , overgrown with morning-glories , grapevines , ivy , and rambling rose , and I knew from my foray into the Forest that a catwalk was attached to the other side of the trellis and ran from the alley to Orville Sanderson 's back door . " Chockakeewah , " a voice off to the left said . " Enter brave scribe and guest you 've got . " We stepped into the clearing and people began to appear from beneath the catwalk and out of the brush around us  --  Buddy Schonbeck , Douglas Kuntz , and the Rimsky brothers , Leo and Brian  --  and in the silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's Brian doing here ? He was my age and was so mistreated by his older brother , Leo , he 'd become the object of everybody 's abuse . He was small for his age , but had a head bigger than most adults ' , and shaped like a light bulb , with a petite pointed chin and the wizened thin-lipped smile of an old woman 's mouth , and seemed angry most of the time , sullen andp212righteously pugnacious , and was always being sent to the library , a narrow room with roll-down maps and statues of saints everywhere , in punishment for his sins of misconduct , disobedience , and disrespect . He had a sack in his hands now and looked as apprehensive as I felt . Douglas Kuntz came over and stared me down . Then he said , " Where 's your offering , k-new one ? " I took the cigars I 'd found in my father 's desk from under my shirt front , three of them , and handed them to Kuntz , who was , as my brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruler Number Two and Jerome was the secretary . Kuntz examined the crackling cigars , and then at last gave one to Leo and one to my brother with a solemnity unusual for him ; he was usually laughing , showing horsy yellow teeth , at a practical joke he 'd devised , or a name he 'd made up , such as the one for his sister 's cat , a dogsizedbeast with dugs that all but rubbed the ground : Tittyolebuzzard . " Are you a Catholic ? " he asked me . " Yes . " " Have you made your First Communion yet ? " " Yes . " " Are your parents Catholic ? " " No . " " What do you mean by that ? " These questions seemed unnecessary and foolish , since Kuntz had sat in the same schoolroom with me , and I was n't sure he was n't having me on . " Why are n't they ? " " Oh , come on , you  --  " " Why ? " Kuntz said . He was soberingly serious now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mother has n't converted yet . " " How come ? " " I do n't know . " " Will she ? " " Yes , probably . " " When ? " " Maybe this summer yet . "  | " Good . Do you know any Latin ? " " Yes . " " You better say some then . " " Conpteor Deo omnipotenti , Beatae Mariae , semper Virgini , Beato  --  " " O.K. , that 's enough . " Kuntz began to interrogate Brian in the same way , his voice low and nasal and accompanied by a buzzing murmur from the center of his nose , which was so long it gave his small eyes a look of constant cunning . There was a scar across the center of the bridge of it where it had been broken , by Kuntz 's father , everybodysaid ; his father was older than our parents , worked for the railroad and was seldom at home , and seemed to have moral reasons for keeping himself so obscure . Kuntz had an older brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all lived in a yellow-painted railroad car pulled from a siding out to the far edge of town  --  and was tough and self-reliant , but not a bully , as he could have been . He listened a lot to the radio and was as in love with the Lone Ranger as a boy his age could be and still be a boy . During the summer when he spent his time outside , or in the fall , practicing football with the rest of us ( tackle , without equipment , to toughen us up for the school team ) , he carried an alarm clock along with him and when it went off , at a few minutes before six , he ran over and held it above his head , the alarm still going , and cried , " Hi-ho , Silver ! Away-y-y ! " and then took off for home in that lumbering , **31;2029;TOOLONG that does as a horse 's gallop among children , or did then , slapping his ass with his free hand as if to get it to catch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now when Kuntz instructed Brian to say Latin , Brian said , in his pugnacious way , " Oh , Gobbledegook , you dumb-ass . You know I  --  " Leo slapped the back of Brian 's head . " Watch what you call our Ruler , or you wo n't be in , " he said . He spoke through clenched teeth , hardly moving his lips , in the peevish voice of his father , but always with amusement in his eyes , as if mocking his father 's manlier of speaking , or the idea that he had a voice like his father 's , and the amusement shone brightest when he was beating up on or bettering Brian.  | " Oh , come on , " Brian said , and turned to him . " You know he 's as dumb as  --  " This time the slap came from Kuntz . Kuntz seemed intelligent enough , but the Sisters flunked him in the second grade ; twice , and considered him a bad influence and a fool  --  flicking girls ' butts as he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which were that big  --  and when one Sister once asked him what he expected to make of his life with this attitude he always had , Kuntz said , in the deep voice he did so well , " Go into the Black Hills of South Dakota and ride Silver , Sister Mary Michael Theresa , by golly , yessir ! " " And I have n't seen your offering yet , " he said to Brian now . Brian unrolled his paper sack , took a jar out , and handed it to Kuntz . " Hey ! " Kuntz said , and his big teeth appeared in the horsy smile . " Hey , look at this . " He showed around a jar that looked painted from the inside with white opaque paint . " It 's marshmallowcream , you guys . It 's one of my favorites ! " " That 's what Leo told me , " Brian said . He looked close totears . " All right , " Kuntz said . " Give them the old initiation treatment ! How-wah ! A-Huggah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then other arms brought me down , and there was the stench of the ground , rank and sewery , leaf mold and decay , bodies covering mine , hands gripping me , and a succession of knuckle rubs ran vibrating over the top of my head until one eye ached and my skull swelled into a lopsided element blooming beyond my hair at some balloonlike areas rubbed thin . I could hear Brian cursing and crying out and then a set of knuckles was gentler on me  --  my brother ? Kuntz ?  --  and I realized that Brian was getting the worst of it ; his nickname was Little Fititzer and he was always getting a " fititz , " a quick skidding knuckle up the back of his head , his head was such a temptation to scrub on or rub or desecrate , or simply touch , it was so big . " O.K. , " Kuntz said . " That 's enough . Let ' em up now . " " Damn you ! " It was Brian . He was on his feet and swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the wrists , tripped him so he hit hard on his butt , and sat across his stomachp215where his shirt was pulled up . " Get off ! " Brian cried . " Let me up ! " " Stop punching first . " " I 'm not , now ! " " Your hands are trying to , Little Fititzer , I can feel . " Brian stopped arching his back and a tear streaked from one eye into an ear . " I bet none of the rest of you guys got this crap ! " he cried . " I bet we did , " Leo said to him . " Oh , yeah ? Well , who gave it to Kuntz ? " Leo , still astride him , turned to everybody with his amused look , and then smiled with clenched teeth . " We all gave it to him , " he said , and nodded at Kuntz . " Not ? " " Right , " Kuntz said . " That 's right . O.K. , O.K. , let him up , Pajinsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's just about ready to have something to say . Pajinsky Bear was his name for Leo , derived from Leo 's smile , which reminded us of Theodore Roosevelt , a hero whose boyhood we had to study , even in lower grades , since he was the only President of the United States who ever lived or had a home in North Dakota , or cared to come close , it seemed . Kuntz also named Jerome " Paws " and me " Lids " and Buddy Schonbeck he merely called Buddy , which is what Buddy 's parents called him , and had named him , in fact . He was skinny and thick-lipped , with a gangling elusivenessthat marked him as a halfback or end for the high-school six-man football team , and was n't friendly to anybody , much less a buddy to them ; he spoke only to be contentious , even with the Sisters and Father Schimmelpfennig ( " Yeah , well , that 's not the way my dad said it went "  --  about the Crucifixion ) , about any topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even switch sides to keep the argument going . He insisted the Sisters wore rubber bags under their skirts , because nobody had ever seen them go pee , etc . I could understand Jerome 's nickname  --  he held his fingers apart and his hands somewhat away from his sides when he walked , a little like a gunslinger stalking a street  --  but I was bothered by my own , and once when I asked Kuntz what he meant by naming me that , Lids , he said , " Because you 're thin as a pencil lead . " 1. id , Kuntz ?  |p216Now  Kuntz went to the dead tree , rolled out a sawed-off sectionof log from behind it , and sat down . " All right , you and you "  --  to me and Brian  --  " sit here on the ground in front of me . Suey ! " We sat down . " Cross your legs . " We crossed our legs . " O.K. , now here 's the deal . This is your initiation time , you see . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day and  --  " " Oh , come on , " Brian said . " You get the head treatment every day . " Kuntz held up a hand to stop Leo from whapping Brian . " And besides that , you 've got to learn our ceremonies  --  or else you 're out . You have to learn them exactly , too , like that lousy Minuet we did last winter , puck , puck , pa-cock ! " Everybody snorted , chuckled , or guffawed . " And besides that , you each have a duty you have to do . Everybody 's got to have a duty to do . We 'll decide on yours-a while later , here . Now , after a week we take a vote on both of youse , and if more than two are against you , you 're out . " " Yeah , " Leo said , and his laughter shadowed the leaf-shaded clearing with the dark intent of the intonations in it . " Should we show them our hiding place , Number Two and scribe ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then if we do n't it is and go get him so he 'll never forget , Pajunkety Camelhump , old Toaderspies ! " The nose , the nose , I thought , and could feel Leo 's smile behind me . Kuntz took us behind the dead tree , where there was a round depression into which his log , or stool , or throne , or whatever , must sit , and brushed away some leaves and dirt at the bottom of the depression , revealing a board recessed into the ground . he lifted this up , took a wooden box out from beneath it , and opened the box on votive candles , clean white handkerchiefs , a glass jar filled with farmer 's matches , silver needles , nut an oval tin of Cavaliers.  | " Hey ! " Brian cried . " I know where you got those cigarettes ! Dad just put a display on them up in our damn store ! " There was a smacking report close to my ear as Leo , of course , got Brian again . Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the store , dummkopf ! How many places in town do you think have got them in ? If Dad sees any missing , I 'll know why , you hear , you slimy little puke of a morfadike ! " Brian bowed his big head . " O.K. , Leo , " he said . " Schonbeck ! Paws ! You know your duties , " Kuntz said . " Get at it ! " Buddy took some cigarettes out of the tin , broke each in two , three halved , took out matches and placed them beside the cigarettepieces , on top of Kuntz 's wooden seat , and then took the tin and the jar of matches behind the tree again , presumably to hide them . Jerome came over to the dead tree . It had been snapped in two by lightning about eleven feet up , and its upper half , still attached by a splintery hinge of graying wood , had fallen close to its trunk , forming an inverted V ; shrubbery and vines grew in a profusion inside this natural arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and then reached deep in them and began pulling out branches of cut lilac and laying them on the ground , and as more and more came out , I could see , resting on a limb level with my eyes , an apple crate or an orange box covered with a green cloth . Leo went to Jerome and they each took opposite corners of the cloth , turned toward Kuntz in unison , as if serving at Mass , said Domine , non sum dignus , and drew the veil . The crate was lined with rich , red , velvetlike material , as rich as the best vestments Father wore , and standing inside was a plaster statuette of the Blessed Virgin , in blue and white gowns trimmed with gold , her head bowed , her palms turned out and held below her waist in patient supplication . " Is that neat , " Brian said , and the two of us moved closer . " Where 'd you get it , guys ? " " You ca n't call us that yet , " Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kuntz told him . " Over there . " I looked where he was pointing and saw through the leaves to the atilt pile behind the Catholic church , like the large blue-gray ,  |p218glass-glittering  one behind Eichelburger 's Tavern , which we picked through sometimes to find cigarette butts ; drunkards put them out long . Then I noticed that the base the Virgin was standing on  --  the upper half of a blue hemisphere overlaid with different-sized silver-colored stars  --  was broken off , and the front part of her feet and the head of the snake she was standing on were gone . On either side of her were vigil glasses , a nubbly yellow one with a chip out of its rim , and one blue . " Where 'd you get the vigil glasses ? " I asked . " Those are n't what you think they are , " Kuntz said . " Those are our cruets . " " No , sir , " I said . " Cruets are  --  " But stopped at the look from Jerome . " Pajinsky Bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch sacks , " Kuntz said . " Oh . " One of the duties of the third grade was to clean out the vigil glasses that had been used for so many offerings they were filling with wicks and unburned wax and those tinnily thin silver plates from the base of each vanished candle ; the Sisters brought the glasses over to school from the church and supplied the class with table knives for the task . " We never burn candles in our cruets , " Kuntz said . " You got that ? You never do or else "  --  he made a motion across his throat as though he had one of the knives now  --  " grick ! They 're where we keep our relics . Here . " He reached and stopped , a startled look in his eyes , and then whirled his forefinger close to one ear in a blur , and everybody separated and stepped noiselessly into neighboring brush , Brian led by Leo , who had a hand over his mouth , and me by Jerome , and then I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and saw the blooms on the trellis tremble like the musculature below my heart . After a while everybody came back into the clearing , and Kuntz said , " Yeah , I should have told you about that . " He whirled his forefinger in the same way . " Anybody , even you new guys , can do that if you think you hear hint coming or on the prowl . He 's a Scheisspot . O.K. , the relics . " He took down the yellow cruet and held it out to Brian and me and I saw miraculous medals , a square scapular of brownfeltlike cloth , newly minted pennies , and several small , circularp219glass reflectors  --  red , yellow , orange , and blue  --  that had been pried loose , by the looks of it , from the big-buckled , broad cowboybelt Kuntz had on now . He put back this cruet and took down the blue one , which was filled with shredded and spicy-smelling herbs or weeds or " It 's just dead leaves , " Brian said . " Spearmint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chewing after we smoke . " " I chew bubble gum , " Brian said . " It kills the smell the best . " " O.K. , " Kuntz said . " That 'll be your duty . You keep us suppliedin bubble gum all summer . " " O.K. , " Brian said . " No , no , wait , " Leo said . " I 've got a better one . " " What ? " " Bring us a jar of marshmallow cream every week , ha ! " " Yeah , well , hey now , that is a pretty good one , " Kuntz said . " Oh , come on , Leo ! Dad knows how much there is there , hecounts the damn jars , you know that . He knows you like it . Whatif he catches me stealing some ? " " Tough titty , if you want to be in this club . " Brian turned on me . " What 's his duty , then ? " " I got one , " Kuntz said , and laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long teeth . " He can beg Hershey bars from Wilhomena . She 'll give you one if you go to the back door and beg like you 're starving and a fool for food . Grrrompf ! Du Deibel , du ! ' she 'll squeak at you . He can beg a Hershey bar every day for two weeks from her . Haw ! " Kuntz and Leo kept laughing at this and Brian said , " Oh , boy , tough duty . " And then to Leo , " What 's yours , I 'd like to know ? " " I got to cut new branches when these get dry , the lilacs , to keep the shrine here covered up . " " Oh , boy . " " Plus the cigarettes . So you also got to do the bubble gum , guy ! " " What 's yours , Kuntz ? " " I lead you on raids into the neighborhood countryside on my mighty steed , Silver ! " " I quit , " Brian said . " Good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wizened mouth constricted tight . " No , " he murmured . " I do n't quit , you guys . Please . " " Do n't call us that yet ! " Leo cried . " O.K. , here 's the next thing , " Kuntz said , and went to the shrine , reached to the back of the cloth-lined box , and brought out another glass , much larger than the other two , and scarlet- ' colored , with an image of the Sacred Heart , crossed with thorns and bleeding , embossed on it . " This is our sanctuary lamp . We burn our candles in here . Never in the cruets . You got that separated yet ? Allus in this . " He held the glass close to Brian 's nose . " You know where I got this ? Out of the church . Right out of the sacristy when Father was there , serving Saturday Mass one time . And the candles we burn in it ? I swipe them off the church 's offertory racks when I 'm out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You got anything to say about that ? " " No , " Brian said . " You ? " he said to me . " No . " It seemed wrong to steal from the church ; just the idea of it made my watery knees feel they might have to take a leak , too . " Maybe you 'll have to help me , " Kuntz said . " If we let you join in . " He put the sanctuary lamp back , directly in front of the statue now . " Start them in on the ceremonies , Ruler Number One , " Leo said . " Yessir , yessir , " Kuntz said . " O.K. , now you guys watch everything we do , and if you ca n't learn to do it in a week , you 're out , sorry , boys , that 's it , but you are , boo-hoo . " He passed around the cigarette halves . " Turn the raggaly end out , " he said , as if aware I 'd been wondering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , genuflected , and then Leo came up and lit his , genuflected , and then Jerome . . . " Do we have to smoke these ? " I said . " Do you want to eat it ? " Kuntz asked . " I have n't ever smoked much and sometimes  --  " My vision popped out of focus and flooded with blue along its edges , while a warns sensation , like a sprawling bee sting , rose and spread over the back my skull , and tlun 1 could see again.  | " This is part of the ceremony now ! " Leo said . " Do n't ruin it ! " " Right , " Kuntz said . " If you do n't learn to smoke and inhale , boys , you 're also really out . Ka-choom ! " " Inhale ? " " My big brother showed me . Watch . " Kuntz sucked down a thin puff , his chest heaving with a cough , coughed hard once , bit it back , his face going violet , and said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that in a week . Aghh ! Only sissies and old ladies do n't . They could n't take what it does to you . Gough ! Gough ! Hee-haw , utta ka-CHOO ! " Brian and I went and lit our cigarettes , genuflected , and started hacking up smoke , and I saw as from a distance my perceptions narrow to this white column in my hand , the talismanto master before I could enter this club , and all of the possibilities it evoked . " After three drags , we put them out like this , " Kuntz said . He spat in his palm and rolled the sputtering cigarette end around in it . " Bieck ! And then we put them back down here on top of my gospel chair . " Kuntz and Leo knelt down , side by side , in front of the shrine , Jerome and Buddy knelt in a pair behind them , and Kuntz told Brian and me to kneel behind those two and leave plenty of space in between . " Also , " Kuntz said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . It works the best . " Into the dizzying darkness , where echoing sparks and spheres colliding in brown and blue and beige outbursts threatened to pull me off balance , Kuntz 's quavering voice came and said , " Well , I guess you 'll have to keep diem open for a while until you see how we do this , guys . Pardon inc . What a dummo ! A goof ! Gorp , yawlk ! " Allah ! " he cried in his commanding voice , and everybody lifted their arms above their heads and then lowered them , outstretched , to the ground , bowing as the turbaned men bowed in the Sabu movies shown in serial form every weekend at the Town Hall , and then everybody rose and did a thumping and a nua-culpaing of their chests , which Brian and I joined in on on our private drums , and then we lifted our arms up to the outcry of " Allah , " and prostrated ourselves again . We continued this for eleven tittles , as I counted it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variations were being added ( none were ) and confronting the soles of the shoes and above them the close big bent butts of Buddy and Jerome , bowing , bobbing down , and once when I glanced over at Brian , to see how he was doing , his eyes were open also , and he stuck out his tongue . We were done with that , then , apparently , and Kuntz once more handed around the cigarettes ( was this mine , I wondered , staring at the damp-ended butt ) , which were lit as before from the sanctuary lamp . " O.K. , " Kuntz said . " Now you kneel there and smoke the whole thing down as far as you can , and inhale it three times while you stare at Our Lady of the Black Forest . Now , you ca n't look at anybody when they 're smoking and mess up what they 're thinking about , and you also got ta sorta examine your conscience real hard . This is serious . " " Examine my conscience , " Brian said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Leo said . " You 've got to think of things so awful you did , you would n't even tell them to Father . Go to it , guys ! " I tried to smoke and stared at the statue , which took motion under my stare or from the smoke crossing between . My eyes burned , my throat was so swollen it was hard to swallow , and my skull was pulsing as if receiving directly the rhythms , currents , and contents of my heart , burgeoning , so displaced I kept having to shift my knees to remain upright , while the scarlet-colored sanctuary lamp cast streaks of red and yellow across the statue , which changed color and location and shape with the changing flame , a wide red one quavering up and down as it contracted , lenslike , blue-white along its edges , and then disappeared and was replaced by a yellowish band wobbling lopsidedly at a lower level , then the red reappearing in a lighter shade , pink-crimson , salmon , rose , rising as high as the Virgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then flowing down the folds of her gown and tilting at a lower level , until I was filled with the fears and fantasies that had troubled me since I 'd seen , through a split panel in the door between my room and the closet off our bathroom , my mother with raised dress and sagging pants put inside a white harness a big wide cottony bandage up between her thighs : legs in front of pink curtains , turning to catch the light ; legs with flowery tops on their stockings , sheathed or unsheathed ; the wayp223certain women 's breasts were right for you no matter what age ; the red-blond or coppery-black spiky fur fringing the outer edges of the inner band of their swimming suits , and more in a more blossoming and a more melodious way that " Yesterday I saw my sister 's buzzooms , " Kuntz said . " It was right after she washed them off and , boy , did I want to diddle around with them ! Mama ! " " I went upstairs when my mother was dressing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " A mama mia , too ! " " I put my head down on the ground right in the grass underneathSusie Eichelburger so I could watch the piss come out of that little hole she 's got up in there , " Buddy said . " You know , right ? " " I pretended to fall against the bathroom door when my dad was in there and got a look at his dingus , " Jerome said . " It 's like the sausage of a horse ! " " Did you want to diddle around with it ? " Kuntz asked . " Oh , come on , Kuntz , that 's enough ! " " I stold mash  --  Crap . I stold marshmallow cream from my dad 's store , " Brian said . " No good , " Leo said . " It does n't count ! Tell him why , Kuntz . " " Well , I would n't ever say that to Father in the confessional ! " Brian cried . " Think of something else , " Kuntz said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hot diggity , a rarf ! rarf ! " b " The other day I wanted to pick up a rotten knife and stab Leo in the back with it ! " Brian cried . " That 's good , " Leo said . " That 's a good one , Fititzer . " " I saw Susie Eichelburger with her pants off , " I said . " No go , " Leo said . " Schonbeck already used her . " " I saw Susie 's mother with her pants off , " I said . This was a lie , but I 'd seen enough of my mother to say it ; the white of her thighs naked in the darkness . " You saw Susie 's mother with her pants off ? " Kuntz said . " Yes . " " Was there fuzz on it ? Did it look like a beaver ? " " Yes . " " Did your peterdink get stiff ? "  | " Yes . " " Real long ? " " Well . " " Did you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure . " " Oh , wow ! " It seemed Kuntz 's eyes would n't be small again , and also that this part of the ceremony was at an end for now . Buddx gathered up the cigarette butts and dropped them down a hole in the top of a fence post . Kuntz leaned against the dead tree , yawned , and said , " O.K. , now you can just relax and enjoy the club , guys . " I stretched out on my back on the ground , copying other members , and slipped my hands under my head . There was only the sound of the leaves in the trees above us . Kuntz mentioned a prank he 'd played on Mary Liffert last Halloween ; defecated in a paper bag , put it on her porch , set it afire , and then banged on the door . " And she came out with her jiggly legs going all over , kickingaround and hopping and dancing , screaming , ' Fire ! Fire ! ' and then started stomping up and down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kibosh , and I wanted to say I was sorry it was such a wet one . Wawk ! " There was a quiet wave of laughter in the clearing , beyond civilization now . " Did you hear what old man Ianaccona did last Halloween ? " Leo said . " The high-school guys were always tipping his crapper , so early Halloween night he moves it ahead a little , and when the guys run up to give it the push , whoosh , they all fall in the hole , ha ! Imagine both your legs all the way to the top in that mob of dead guts . Phew ! " There was a lighter scattering of laughter among the leaves . Jerome said , " When we were living at our old place , once when Dad was out in the can there , dumping , he heard voices and then the can started to go , so he yelled , Hey-ey , at least wait till I 'm done in here ! ' It must have been some of the kids he taught , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can again . " " Was n't that the one that was wired down ? " Leo asked . " The owner of the place , Peter Schonuner , did that . "  | " It just makes the guys want to tip it over all the more , " Leo said . " I know , " Jerome said . " That 's the way it seems sometimes . " Again there was only the sound of the leaves . I was still dizzy , vertiginous , displaced , and felt I was being rocked by the branches above me , cradled and rocked , and wondered what it was like before , once , when there was ground beneath . The subdued conversation moved to the topic of parents and older people , and all the mistakes they made , and we agreed that when we grew up our lives would be different from theirs ; we 'd never get married or have children , or worry , or go to church all the time , or have a job you had to go to every morning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you away from the house , or have headaches , or have to lie down and rest , or drive a car that was always breaking down either where there were no other cars close to help or else out where everybody could see , or go to parties because you were expected to and people might gossip if you did n't show up ( and the leaves above us swayed with the wind and clashed together , saying , Yes , you will live like this , yes , yes , you will , yes ) , or do any work to merely do work and please others , but instead spend our energies on ourselves , moving from place to place in search of pleasure and others like us , and our parents would be surprised , and then envious , because we 'd be living lives that they 'd only dreamed about , if they 'd gone that far , and ours would be the happiest lives that had ever been lived  --  the trees and brush taking on the density of a real forest , with branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of memory , shielding us from the village and its inhabitants , who 'd never understand us and all of these sinful desires we had . And again there was a long silence . The afternoon light was leaving in the lifting way it leaves the plain , as though tilting over in the air toward the sun , which then draws it on forward and out , and we all felt hungry in the numbing one-minded way in which boys that age get hungry at that hour , while the village smells of mingled cooking drew around us . This was no Black Forest to us now . We got up , replaced and hid the shrine , said goodbye to one another in a solemn manner , and then all of us ,  |p226once  out of sight of one another  --  Jerome and I were no different from the rest  --  took off on a dead run toward home . A week later Brian and I became members of the club that met in secret in the Black Forest , but Brian barely so ; Leo voted against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome and Kuntz would n't listen or be moved by him . The rituals went on for a week without change and I sensed everybodybecoming like I was : listless and defiant of rules and orders , of Kuntz and Leo , and more violent in their fantasies ; most of the women in the village had been seen naked or in some form of undress , and Father Schimmelpfennig was discovered in the dark of his back yard , " taking a tinkle like a lady because priests they are n't allowed to have a pecker , you think , right ? Ah , hee , hee . " It was during this time of unquiet , boredom , and barefaced lies , on an afternoon as I lay under the enveloping leaves , that I knew for sure , as I 'd always sensed , that somebody watched every detail of everything we did . I 'd see a pale patch above the stone wall . Or a form would go in a running retreat down the alley at times . Or there 'd be a flash or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from another club , one formed by the public-schoolcrsin town , a minority , a group that did n't mix much with the Catholic kids , and was n't welcome to . I mentioned the possible scout . " Oh , " Kuntz said . " That 's only Ribs . He 's allus hanging around . " " Oh . " Everett Ritter , or Everribber , or Ribs , as he was called , due to his physique , had big brimming dark-brown eyes and blue-black hair , and a delicately modeled brunette woman 's face  --  caves , bone , and shadows of rest and prayer . A few years ago his father had been found dead on the road with the pickup he 'd been driving crashed a hundred yards ahead of him , and it was never known for sure whether he 'd accidentally leaned on the door handle and fallen , or thrown himself out . Ribs lived with his mother and sisters at the edge of town itt an unpainted house with shells of abandoned automobiles mound it . His father had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orp227another of the cars , his hands on its wheel as if driving  --  Where ? His mother did washing and ironing to support them , and Ribs wore worn and patched hand-me-downs from nearly every family in town , so you 'd sometimes find somebody else  --  " Oh , Ribs , excuseme "  --  inside the shirt of an old friend . He never spoke on his own and when he was spoken to , when he was delivering clothes , or picking up groceries from the Red Owl , he answered with a single word or a shrug , or just lowered his eyes and walked on . " Hey , listen , " Kuntz said . " What should we do about him ? " " Make him a member , " Brian said . " And then give him the old initiation treatment ! " " How so ? " Leo said . " He ai n't Catholic . " " He could learn the stuff , " Brian said . " I did . It 's easy as pie . Look at me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you have , " Leo said . " And you still look like a goddamn pumpkin on legs . " " We could use him as a spy , " Jerome said . " Hey , that 's good , " Kuntz said . " We could find out if anybody else in town has a club and raid the buggers , clop , clop , hocka pa-tchew ! " " Right , " Leo said . " Wreck the place ! " " Let 's fake like we want him in with us , " Brian said , " and then everybody pile in on him . " " What a shipid idea , " Buddy said . " I 've never heard such a stupid idea ! Fititzer , you 're so stupid ! " " What 's your bright idea , limp lips ? " " Watch out who you 're calling what or you 'll be out ! " Buddy cried . " How do you think you got into this club in the first place ? " " Not by no help from you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Leo told me . " " I did not ! I voted you in ! " Buddy 's face was red and thrust so far forward on his neck the cords of it bulged , and there was spittle on his big lips . " So where 's your bright idea ? " Brian said . " I 'll run him down and throw him a flying tackle , by golly ! " " Oh , boy , " Brian said . " Oh , boy-oh-boy. "  | " You 're too big , Schonbeck , " Jerome said . " You 'd hurt the kid . " " Let 's just take him down and give him a knuckle rub and turn him loose , " Brian said . " Or else pull off his pants and run them up the flagpole for the rest of the afternoon . Somebody be a sport , guys ! " " Shush , " Leo said . " He 's back . Over there by the playing field . " It seemed a network of darkness darker than the leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blue-black hair and part of a face among the boulders of the gray-black wall . Kuntz went to the edge of the clearing . " Hey , Ribs ! " he called . " We see you . Come on out ! We want to talk to you . " Ribs sprang back into the open in a crouch , ready to run . " Take it easy , " Kuntz said . " We wo n't hurt you , Ribs . We want to talk to you about joining in with us . " Ribs 's face paled more as he shook his head . " Is it all right if I come over there ? " Kuntz asked . Ribs shook his head . " See ! " Buddy whispered . " I 'll make a treaty with you , " Kuntz said . " I 'll leave all these jerks right here and just me come over and talk . I 'll stay on this side of the wall and wo n't come close to you . I 'll hold my hands behind my back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested by all this was behind him . " It 's O.K. , " Kuntz said . " I give you my word of honor , ah-r000-ha , bright steed , Chuckaluck , ah , wh0000-up there ! Really . " And then he walked over with his hands behind him , in his pockets , and stopped a few feet from the wall . " Hey , we do n't want to hurt you . We 'd like you to join in with us . " Ribs stared at him with his wide and tremulous eyes . " Would n't you like to ? " It seemed no response would come . " It 's simple . You could learn the stuff in a day . " " Oh , yeah ! " Buddy yelled , and Ribs tensed , about to bolt . " Shut up ! " Kuntz shouted at him , and then turned back toRibs . " Really . It 's simple . Here 's part of it : Are you a Catholic ? " Ribs shook his head.  | " Was your mother ever a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked in , and his eyes widened in anticipation of the next , logical question , but Kuntz said , " You believe in God , though , right ? " " No . " Everybody was on their feet and after Ribs , Buddy out front , passing Kuntz , leaping the stone wall when Ribs was halfway down the field , and then catching him before he reached the far end , where there were shrubs along the wall , and throwing that flying tackle he 'd talked about . Ribs went sailing with his legs in a hug and his head hit the wall . The sound was like a football punted , stone hitting stone , a watermelon dropped , and we all stopped as though it had happened to us , and then Kuntz , who 'd stood where he was , came pushing his way through us and punched Buddy on the shoulder . " I gave my word of honor , dumb-ass ! What 'd you do that for ? " " It 's what you told me to ! " Buddy said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear what he said ? " Kuntz punched $uddy again , in the chest , and Buddy went stumbling backward until gravity caught him and seated him with a shock , for good , it seemed , the way he was splayed out . Kuntz took Ribs by the shoulders and turned him ; whites of his eyes wiggling , lips parted and grayish , his tongue out and bleeding , head jerking with the torturous energy of an uncontainedepileptic . Kuntz kneeled and said , " Hey , hey , hey , " as he held Ribs 's head in his hands and massaged his cheeks with his thumbs . Ribs woke . " I knew you 'd do that , " he said . " I knew you were all a pack of lies . " A blue-white swelling was forming a dome on his forehead and he started to cry without covering his face , as though tears were n't a shame among boys who 'd reached our age and got by . " It was a mistake , " Kuntz said . " No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant it , all of you ! " " Here , here . " Kuntz helped him to his feet and smoothed the dirt off his face and out of his hair , and then brushed off his clothes . " It was that screwball Schonbeck did it , " Kuntz said . " Do you want inc to walk you home ? " Ribs nodded that he did.  | " I 'll tell your mother it was n't a fight , " Kuntz said . " But sort of , we were , well , er  --  " They were through the hedge and off together down the block with one of Kuntz 's arms around Ribs 's neck . The rest of us returned to the clearing , repentant and uneasy , if others were like me , and lay down around the shrine , where the sanctuary lamp still burned . " I told you you 'd hurt him , " Jerome said . " No , you did n't ! Kuntz said that ! " " I was conked out once , " Brian said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Brian 's big head . " Except after you wake up . " There was only the occasional sound of the leaves . I felt chastened , reflective , and bothered by dark doubts ; Kuntz had asked a question he would n't have if Ribs had n't been so different from us , or Kuntz able to sense the difference in him , and it frightened me the way we 'd got up on our feet and gone after him at the same time . Would I have tackled him ? Perhaps . I looked around at the others , at Leo and Brian lying next to one another near the trellis , at Buddy digging in the ground with a Popsicle stick , tears dropping off his chin , at Jerome in front of the shrine on his stomach , and they all seemed absorbed in the same question , or a question of a similar kind . I looked at the sanctuary lamp casting its colored light across the Virgin 's gown , and heard again , Do you believe in God ? The final word came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our parents , the authority of the Sisters , and Father Schimmelpfennig himself ; God , a word I took for granted the way I took my heart for granted  --  although I could n't see it or watch the way it worked , I never doubted its being there . I believe in God , of course I do , I thought , but then as I listened all I could hear inside myself was silence . Did n't I ? Had I returned from the ragged jaws of pneumoniaonly to live inside silence and emptiness ? Was n't that a sin ? What was it I believed in , then ? There was some force that guided me from day to day and act to act and assured renewal and integration to all that I did , roughly as I might do it at times , and assured my good nature , too , and its stability within the progression of time , was n't there ? I listened . Was n't there ? Then the wind sprang up and the light on the Virgin swayed to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it go ,  |p231and  stained her face scarlet , and Yes , the voices of the leaves whispered above me in a chorus  --  made by a mother who was made of earth  --  Yessss , Yessss . It seemed a dream or a miracle to me at the time then , and even more so today , now , still , as once in New York after my wife had had a miscarriage , I woke from sleep and saw over her body to the curtains of our bedroom window , white-silvery , lit by the street lamp outside and imprintedwith frondlike patterns of leaves , and silhouetted against their curves saw the shadow of a head , and before I had time to resort to reason or detachment , knew that the shadow was the shadow of our dead child , and that he was looking in on us , watching us with a patience so infinite it was no part of my experience and made it obvious that we were observing one anotherfrom opposite sides of a transparent mystery . Yes . She 'd studied under Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brilliant , prideful , witty , well read , limited , uncompromising , hyperbolic and extreme , open-minded , too critical both ways , serene , conservative , saintly , down to earth , yet a romantic who could feed on the food of illusion , and Father 's fingers began trembling now , in the way they 'd trembled only once , when he was ordained , as he took from the gold-lined ciborium a consecrated host and placed it on the curved bridge of Alpha Neumiller 's wet , extended , orange-pink tongue.  |p232Held  at arm 's length , he watches her eyes travel over his body and fill with unabashed pride . She 's been to her storeroom and worked with awl , needle , and thread , and now , at last , he feels properly dressed . Covering his blue jeans are the chaps ( " shaps , " she told him , is the correct pronunciation ) that her father wore when he rode horseback over the unbroken plain farther west , a young man at the time . The leather legs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are faced with goat hide that she 's brushed until its silver-colored strands of hair glisten like her brushed hair below his nose , fragrant with her scent . The holster below his hip holds a heavy pistol . Then the plaid shirt and blue bandanna . Their eyes meet and there 's a smile of complicity between them . " Here , " she says , and rises and takes a hat off a hook on the wall behind him . Charles says , " But it 's Dad 's . " " His old one . Come here once . " She kneels on one knee , and again her face is at his level . " But it 's too big ! " " With that head , I would n't be surprised if it fit . " Her tone of voice exposes him as he 's exposed when she checks to make sure he 's had a thorough bath . She sets the hat onp233his head , steps back a step , crosses her arms , and then crosses one leg over the other at the ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite ! " If she were n't his mother , he 'd know that noise is giggling , which he detests , but the truth does n't register : his ideal of her blinds him to her spontaneity . " I 'm anxious to go over it now that you 're in costume . Are n't you ? " He nods , the hat brim hits his nose , and there 's more laughter from her . He lifts it . " See , I ca n't wear this big old thing . " " Stop whining . You sound like a girl . We 'll put some tissue in the crown before tonight . Where 's the script ? Where did I put the script ? " " On the table . Like always . " " I 'm so nervous I ca n't think , " she says , and her changing voice contains less nervousness than delight , as she goes to the table and sits down . She 's been rehearsing this monologue with him for two weeks , two hours each day , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had more training in speech and dramaticsand the theater ; his father defers to her in such decisions . She folds back the blue cover of the script , smooths it flat on the table , and inclines her head over it , chin in one hand . To him , her profile against the brilliant window is a silhouette , dark and featureless , and when she turns to him he bends back the brim of the hat and squints to see her clear . " You look like a fool ! " she cries , and now there 's no doubt that she 's laughing . He throws the hat on the floor . " No , no , " she says . " Do n't . You do n't look so bad , looking a fool . " Charles thinks that perhaps his father is right when he says to her , " You know , sometimes you act like a kid , " which makes her turn white-faced and walk off . But his father is just as bad , or worse ; he works jigsaw puzzles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's dead serious about everything he does . Ills father does n't smoke or drink or swear , like others do , but sits holm . and rc ; ul.s books , and sometimes even cries overp234them  --  a burning shame . And he 's as easily affected by dramas on the radio . " Nonsense , I do n't believe you ! " she 'll say to the radio speaker . Or , " How did she get a job as a professional ? Listen to that shoddy articulation . Listen to that twang ! " But in the end she usually succumbs in the same way as his father , and then stalks into the kitchen and busies herself there until she has her feelings under control . A few nights ago , when she was shopping in McCallister , his father took him through a rehearsal . " Start off , " he said , and his large eyes swept and swam along the lines of the script as Charles went from the beginning of the monologue to its end without being stopped once . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his mother usually interrupted him the moment he went off-key and helped him find his way again . He waited , shaky and anxious , for the criticisms of his phrasing , his timing , and his comic sense , and wondered if his father would be as severe a perfectionist as his mother and make him repeat the lines again and again until it was right according to his father 's ideal . His father raised his eyes , which were liquid with emotion , and said , " I do n't know what to say to you . I really do n't know what to say . You 've got this whole thing memorized word for word . " " Ready ? " his mother asks now . " Hat and all ? " " Oh , be quiet . " " Oh , all right . Let 's both be more businesslike . This might well be your last rehearsal before tonight . " " Tonight " settles below his lungs and sends out appendages that cut off his breath , enjamb his self-control , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two weeks . He wishes he 'd said , like Jerome , when he was asked to perform , " No . I 'm not in the mood to talk in front of people any more . " He 's a weakling , he 's sure of it , but knows it better not be seen by her , and begins : " I 'm , a buckaroo from the Wild West , I rope and I ride and all the rest . . . The words are n't words any more . Repetition has removed from them any meaning , and they affect only his vocal mecha/nism , which vibrates around their shapes , subdues them , and fashions them into images he can see as he speaks . They wo n't meld together at first , and come out as separate geometrics  --  an oblong , an oval , a triangle  --  and fall to the floor in a multicoloredjumble he can practically see but would n't care to look at . Then , as he grows confident , they begin to link and flow toward his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sentence , painted in primary colors , strings together the apples , bushel baskets , marbles , and coins from his first-grade arithmetic book ; that pause before the last , fat , rhymed word of the line , is a beheading . In these phrases a locomotive takes shape , cars link behind , a caboose is there and it all starts down the polished tracks , its wheels settling into a regular clacking , the metallic singsong of a train , the S-curved sound of its whistle retreating into silence , and then the roadbed explodes and its scattering fragments are flushed quail roaring toward the cover of trees . He tries to affect her with his voice , sending her his version of what she 's taught him , watching for her response , and when she has to shield one side of her face to hide her pleasure , or when her laughter draws her head toward the script and her dark hair swings over her cheeks , shining in the sunlight , he feels in himself the size and grandeur of an adult , filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of their vastness and desirability , are n't quite satisfying . " No , no , no , no , no ! You brandish the pistol in the air . You bran-dish it . " She laughs at her exaggeration of the word . " You do n't click the trigger , son . " The tone of her voice and her stare  --  uncompromising , deep blue , a blue he can see and feel even though her features are in shadow  --  make him shrink back into the constricting limits of his years , seven , to be exact . " It 's distracting . If you do that , nobody 's going to pay any attention to the line , understand ? All right , then go on from there . You were doing fine with the speech itself , it was just that pistol . " She turns to her script , and says , " The next thing I know , you 'll be wanting caps for the damn thing . " " Can I ? " All it takes this time is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwelling on the act as though he hopes it will last for/ever . He focuses on the linoleum , through the geometry there , and goes on , feeling each word ring thin and hollowly in the air , convinced he 's disappointing her . He reaches the end . " Now let 's have a look at that hat , " she says , in a voice that 's strangely social and nonchalant . There 's been no praise or encouragement , not even the usual criticism ; he 's failed her and might as well go back to the boys . In her silence and her concern for the hat ( she puts on a version of one of her scowls as she studies its inside ) , she 's withholding the truth out of kindness , he 's sure , aware it would upset him so badly he could n't perform " tonight . " But her silence is as destructive . He wants to run and hide , be like backward footprints vanishing up over sand , so he 'd never have to face her again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although his goal for two weeks has been to win first place , his gift to her . He 's more than surprised , then , and more troubled than ever about his mother , when she tosses the hat into the air with a cry of " Yippee ! " and gives him , most rare and consummate of her rewards , a kiss on the lips . People are appearing on Main Street and moving toward the Town Hall , the building covered with tin that looks like stone . A few feet above the foundation the tin is polished silver from children running their hands over it to create a miniature thunder as they walk past , which Charles does now . The slanting sheets are burnished by the orange sun and the building looks changed and portentous . Instead of housing the usual friendly social gathering , the Town Hall will be the setting tonight for what feels to him like a war . He steps into the entry , carrying a cloth laundry bag with his costume in it , and stares at the ticket booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where a half-moon is removed from the bottom of the window , and on another halfmoon  --  thewooden tray for counting out change  --  a white hand is resting . Because of a reflection , the hand is all he can see , and the anxiety he 's been holding down , now that the hand is there as a focus , swells in him and makes him weak inside , and his eyes bulge . " Do n't just stand there and gape , " she says . " They know we'rep237on the program . We do n't have to pay . Tonight we 're not hoi polloi , boy . Ha ! I did n't mean that to sound that way ! Sorry about that . " They go toward double doors that open onto the auditorium and the reflection slides to one side , revealing the heavily made up face and bejeweled breast of Mrs. June Koenig , the dentist 's wife . " What 's the matter with him ? " she cries , her high voice made indistinct and flat-sounding by the enclosure she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , he 's not , " his mother says , and takes him through the double doors . He 's surrounded by a smell of old varnish , damp crepe paper , mildew , and human sweat  --  a smell that 's meant recreation and friends in the past , but does n't tonight . He sniffs the air as an animal would , testing it ; tonight it will be carrying the sound of his voice . The basketball backboard at the end of the auditorium has been hoisted against the ceiling , the curtains drawn across the stage , and the smell seems responsible for the curtains ' particular shade of purple , for the way the folds in them fall , the way shadows curve between the folds out of sight , and then feet patter across the stage , the curtain billows out along its chain-weighted bottom , and somebody is saying , " Children 's Division is first , and that 's of course the one he 'll be in . " Dr. Koenig , possessor of the biggest hands and broadest fingers he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with seeing them close up when the doctor works on his teeth ) , is the master of ceremonies ; he 's got through the preliminaries with Charles 's mother , just inside the double doors , and now turns to Charles . " Got the jitters , boy ? " he asks . " Not half as bad as I have , " she says . " Well , you ca n't blame a kid for a case of the nerves . I 've got them myself , just knowing I 've got that introducing to do . " " He 'll be all right . So will you . " " I 'm glad to hear it ! " the doctor cries , in the same tone he 'd say , bringing a tooth up in front of Charles 's eyes , I got it , boy ! " And I hope you get that prize of ten silver dollars right off ! Your first year ! I bet you have n't had that much in your hand at one time , have you , Chuck ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And anyhow , I ) oc , the money 's not the important thing. , "  |p238They  both laugh . " Where 's your brothers and that baby sister of yours ? " the doctor asks . " At home , " Charles says to him . " With your dad ? " " Yes . " " I bet he has his hands full , the poor guy . " " Jerome is good with Tim , " she says . " How is that baby sister of yours growing ? " " Fine , " Charles says . " Just like a weed , huh ? " " Like a girl , " he says to him . " They 'll be here . " His mother puts her hands on his shoulders and turns him toward the stage . " Just a second , " the doctor says . They all study one another in quick and searching sudden looks . " There 's this . " The doctor holds up a jar filled with scraps of paper , and shakes it until his bluish jowls also shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to find out when you come up in here . On the program , I mean , of course . " " Do n't get your hand stuck in there , " she warns him . Charles unfolds the paper , looks at her , then at the doctor 's round eyes with tan-colored circles haloing them , then at her , and says , " Five . " The doctor sets the jar on a wooden folding chair , takes a piece of paper from his shirt pocket , takes a pencil from behind his ear ( each movement resplendent with the precision and ominousness Charles finds so frightening in the dental chair ) , traps the paper against the wall with one hand , and says as he writes , " Number 5 , Children 's Division , Chuckie Neumiller . You 'll go on right after Nick Schonbeck sings us a song . The boys and their mothers are using the dressing room to the left of the stage , so that 's of course the one you all 'll have . The girls are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Bronco Boy , ' " she says . The doctor tilts back his chin and releases his rusty but resonantlaugh , which , as always , ends abruptly , with bewildermentp239in his eyes , as though laughter were an enigma to him . " ' Bronco Boy ' ! Sounds like a good one to me , all right ! " " I did n't title it , " she says , and takes Charles by the hand , gives a jerk to get him started , and leads him down the side aisle toward the dressing room . There are n't any people in the rows of folding chairs on the auditorium floor , and the stage spots have n't been turned on , but the blue twilight shining down on him from the high windows at the side of the building gives the place a theatrical glow , and the chairs themselves are like the audience , cold and folded in containment , waiting for the first mistake , or least betrayal of fear . He looks away and sees , on the walls and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crepe paper of every color  --  some of it faded , some stained , some looking new  --  and recalls that at the carnival last winter he was allowed for the first time to stay up until the children were told they could tear the decorations down , but did n't enjoy it ; his mother was n't there . She 'd sat alone at a side table most of the evening , fiddling with a trinket he 'd won at the Fish Pond , ignored by most of the women her age and older , and finally said she was tired and put on her coat , pulled its collar around her throat , and went home , leaving him and Jerome with their father . From the dressing room he can hear excited voices that flow over him with more force when his mother opens the door ; he takes in the female legs above ( the dressing room is up a few steps ) , the smoke and lights , the smell of burnt cork and makeup . Faces turn toward them , there 's a catch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lower level . She leads him down the dressing room , narrow as a corridor , past women putting rouge on their sons ' pale cheeks , wiping away streaks of dirt with saliva-moistened handkerchiefs , going over the do re mi , and , in one instance , taking Scotch tape off a wave of hair taped to a forehead . Nobody greets them . Near the back , a woman is telling her son , who 's slumped on a bench and crying , to grow up and act like a man , because he 's going to get out there and sing whether he likes it or not . Nick Schonbcck . Charles 's mother stops and releases his hand . " What 's wrong ? " she says to Nick.  | " Oh , do n't ask me ! " Mrs. Schonbeck cries , and blows air out of her lower lip , lifting a wisp of hair from her forehead . " I 've been after him for weeks about tonight , and a couple of days ago he seemed all for it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , of course , and now at the last minute he wants to up and quit on me . " " He decided just two days ago ? " " That 's right . " " Well , when has he had the time to rehearse ? " " Well , he 's been singing in school all along , and so much at home it gets on the husband 's nerves . So all we had to do was find a piece he liked that I could play on the piano . " Charles 's mother kneels in front of Nick and takes his hand in hers . " Are you scared ? " He nods at her , his jaw trembles , and his tears , having wet paths prepared for them , slide clown his cheeks . " What grade do you get in singing at school ? " Nick opens his mouth wide and bawls , " AAAAAA 's , Ma , do n't I ! " " Charles gets C 's . I tell him a C means he can sing like a canary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Have you ever heard him sing , Nick ? " Nick snuffles and studies her with a mixture of skepticism and shame . " What does he sound like instead ? Think of an animal with a name that starts with a C. " Nick wipes the tears from his cheeks with the back of his hand and looks at Charles . Then he grins with all his teeth . " A cow ! He sounds like a cow to me ! " " Exactly . Now , knowing there are people who sound like that , and how you do , and what a wonderful gift it is to have a voice like yours , do n't you ever wonder if it is n't a little strange for you to be afraid ? Are n't you even a little ashamed of it , as good as you are ? " Nick lowers his head and , after a moment , nods it twice to her . " That means you 're sorry for being this way , causing your mother such worry , which means you 'll sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  to make up for it . "  |p241She  pats him on the knee , rises , and takes Charles to the back of the room , where she sits him on a wooden bench , and , as she begins to undress him , says , " Do n't be jealous . If you 'd like , you can be angry . I did n't appreciate the way he said that either , about the cow . But you 're a pro . And you 're grownup enough to understand why I said what I did or I would n't have . Here , now ! Stand up straight ! " Then , as she helps him on with his costume , which feels chilly and stiff after his street clothes , she generates a silence that shields him from the disorganization and tumult of the room , and he leaves the hubbub about them , conscious only of her , of her bands moving up the buttons of his shirt , her eyes traveling over his face and clothes , examining them quickly but with care to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , pausing , passing over it again , and once again he senses that he 's an adult , and thinks , This will last forever . From the gentleness of her touch he understands more what she meant about Nick than her words could say , and realizes that this gentleness , present no matter how straightforward or unpredictableshe might be , was communicated to Nick when she took his hand . And then he 's jealous , and his face burns as with the fever of pneumonia . She rechecks the tissue in the hat , the bandanna , the belt of the holster ( " Whatever you do , do n't click that thing ! " ) , and the broad , bow-curved , tooled-leather belt of the chaps , and says , " Just do what you 've learned , " and leaves him . He goes out the side of the dressing room and stands in a darkened wing of the stage , filled with her serenity , her gift to him , and walks to a traveling drape gathered near the cyclorama , takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrappinghimself up in its folds , and remains there until he 's heard applause for the first performer , and then unwinds himself , and sees light , and feels a detached , trancelike pall over his emotions . Why is he here , now , tonight ? Mary Beth Friewirth , in the opposite wing , makes a hurried sign of the cross and walks into the spotlights in a white dress , her First Communion dress minus the veil , and sings " Dear I harts and Gentle People . " Applause . Edward Hyerdahl , dressed as Uncle Sam , does a tap dance to " I 'm a Yankee Doodlep242Dandy . " The clash and rattle of his metal taps on a Masonite square . Applause . Nick Schonbeck , with blackface covering whatever remnants of fear his face might betray , stands with his back to the audience , polishing imaginary shoes , and sings " ChattanoogieShoe Shine Boy " to the jangling and thrum of his mother 's piano and at one point a cry of " Go to it , boy ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Doing a thing called ' Bronco Boy ' ! " A sensation that 's only skirted him before , brushing him when he imagines performing , making him aware of the complexity of his insides , falls over him with its full weight , and his intestines sway to one side as if to make room for greater fear . His tongue is hard and dry ; there 's a rope around his throat as he walks into the brilliant light , blinking against it , and though the outer elements exert so much pressure it seems he 's growing smaller with each step , his composure keeps them outside ; but they have an exhilarating effect , bearing down on his senses , and he feels he 's taken his first steps onto the broad swath of the world . He notices details he would n't under normal conditions  --  the shade of his thumbnail ( why is it so purple ? ) ; a strand of hair on the chaps , longer than the others , that 's discolored ( what from ? ) ; the grain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brightly lighted , that seem to have been arranged over the grain with an eye for symmetry ; a piece of blue thread stuck to the sole of his boot , and the shadow of the thread , also blue  --  and takes them in in a matter of steps . The houselights are off , but he can see rows of faces and identifyseparate people . He finds his mother and , closer up front , Tim and Jerome , and sees that the contestants who 've finished are sitting on the floor below the stage ( Nick Schonbeck appears ) along with some of the Rimsky boys , Kuntz , who cries " Wowk ! Wowk ! " and Ribs , off to one side , alone , and realizes that he 's not only made it to the apron and executed his bow but is smiling and ready to begin , prepared for anything but the giggling all around , and not just at Kuntz . Then the white arms of some girls in the front row point at him . They 're laughing at the chaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew they were mocking anything of his , and his mother has workedp243over the chaps for hours to assure a perfect fit , so where 's the reason to laugh ? Are they laughing at her ? Who ? In the manylayeredlevel of impressions , through anger and hints he 's receivedof her attitude , he thinks , Those people out there are dumb farts . Hicks . He hates them . And once emotion has broken through , the details fall away and he sees only white . Blue-white . Blue , and then races at a rattling speed through the speech without a thought to the phrasing and imagery he 's worked on with her , each line emerging with a spattering flay of fierceness it 's never had , and at the climax , " Yippeee ! " to close off the fools , he grabs the hat and pulls it down over his eyes . The big hand of Dr. Koenig settles across the width of his back and propels him in the proper direction , offstage into the wing . He pulls the hat free , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What will she say about this ? He tries to recall if he clicked the trigger and ca n't . He ca n't even say if he finished the speech . Was the cap pistol there ? And that is n't all . The audienceis still making a sea of noise that supports the loudest cries , and above it all he hears Dr. Koenig wheedling , saying something about wool and eyes , and finally , after another swell , there 's absolute silence out there . He bends down , trembling , and picks the tissue off the floor , as if it 's essential to salvage every part of this he does have , and goes into the dressing room . His mother is there , alone , waiting for him , and before he can say he 's sorry , she grabs him by the scruff of the neck  --  a button pops off his shirt  --  drags him to the rear of the room , and slams him down on the bench so hard that a warm pain sends out tentacles of numbness from the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat down ? " she says in a fierce whisper , shaking his shoulders . " What kind of a second-rate performerare you , anyway ? " A wave of emotion smothers his words , hoarse empty voice . " I 've never been so mortified in my life ! Do you think I took you through two weeks of rehearsal to see you ruin it at the last minute with a piece of cheap slapstick like that ? What 's the matter with you ? " She begins to undress him , and his shirt rips under the armpit . Only children feel with such acuteness what 's communicatedp244through hands , and these are the hands of his mother . He feels desecrated all the way through . The gentleness , the tremor of understanding usually there even when she spanks him , is n't , and when she tugs wrathfully at one leg of the chaps without unbuckling the belt first , the tears that have been building beneath his eyes gather on his lashes , send around turning tines of light , sidewheeling rays , and then burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stunt like that , you do n't deserve to win a dime . " " I do n't want to ! " " You 've performed and you 'll be judged . Except for that slapstick , it 's the best you 've done the speech . I thought they 'd never stop applauding ! Oh ! " " I did it because they made fun ! " " When you 're performing , you have a duty to yourself and your audience , and ca n't lose control  --  you were so good !  --  and when you 're onstage you might well expect to be laughed at . Is n't that one of the reasons you 're out there ? You 're not there to vent your temper , you know . There 's more than enough opportunity for that in everyday life . And if you do n't learn to control your temper there , too , in everyday life , I mean  --  your temper and that terrible pride of yours  --  life 's going to give you an awful lot of trouble , believe me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picks up the tissue he 's dropped , puts it in his hand , and closes his fingers around it . " Here , " she says . " Dry your eyes now . Pretty soon they 'll be announcing the winner . You . " A few minutes later he walks onto the stage to receive , as she 's predicted , the first prize of ten silver dollars . The houselights are on , illuminating the auditorium , but he sees the audience only vaguely , and the faces of his friends and their applause have . little effect on him . He accepts the prize money from Dr. Koenig , thanks him , and as he turns away is grabbed up under the arms , above the head of the doctor , who waltzes him around the stage in big dips a few times to the cries and amusement of the audience , singing something under his sweet-smelling breath that seems to have the streets of Detroit or of old New York , or both of them , mixed up in it , and then Charles comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the wing and places thep245money in the hands of his mother , his real , his unequivocal , and , as the slow unfolding of years will come to prove , his only competitor , his only stumbling block , and his only real friend for life , or so it seems at times , here in the present , as he looks up to find himself alone in a room.  |p246Now  I 'm known as the plumber 's son ( or I was then , after I graduated from being called the principal 's son for so long it gave me a sense of character and pride ) , and it gives me such pleasure to walk in the wake of my father with a coil of copper tubing slung over my shoulder , along with some pipe fittings laced on a wire , I could n't care less what anybody says about either of us . He 's given up his principalship at the high school , and since the summer has been known in town as the man with two jobs . Actually , he has four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works on a book of memoirs that nobody knows about but Charles and Jerome and me , he drives tractor on a farm in the spring and fall , and , fourth , in his spare time , he and I do any plumbing in the area that needs to be done . If we did n't , they 'd have to hire a union man from McCallister , and they 'd be surprised at the prices they 'd have to pay these days . Everybody in Hyatt is putting in plumbing , now that the new mains are in , so there 's always work for us to do over the weekends , or on the days when Dad is n't driving across the countryside and state , to Grand Forks , or Minot , or Devil 's Lake , or Bismarck , to sell insurance . We buy our materials at Pilager 's , which faces the tracks and the depot , and is down the street from Eic:hclburger 's , beyondp247Bill Faber 's blacksmith shop . The Pflagers are the only family in town with two cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for making deliveries . They live in a big , gold-colored house , kitty-corner from the front of ours , their yard surrounded by a fence made of iron bars with big spearheads on their tips . Mrs. Pflager is known as Penny , although her real name is Margaret , because of her red-gold hair . She grows marigolds along her fence and garden and a copper-colored spaniel  --  purebred , they say  --  exercises in the yard behind the fence , its metal tags clanking like car chains in the night when you want to sleep but a car is on a prowl of town . Penny has a set of twins , Chris and Heidi , with hair like hers and her complexion ; and though the twins are likable , and both my age , naturally both , I hardly ever play with them , and neither do many other kids . The twins spend their time in their yard and seem to speak a language of their own , and are so intent upon one another it feels embarrassing to intrude on them . The Pflagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants from all over the world , one of which eats bugs ; I make sure it stays away from me . The Pflagers say the area is growing and prospering ( optimists , my father calls them ) and that someday Hyatt will be built up as big as McCallister , or bigger , and I hope that happens . It 'll give us more plumbing to do . Mr. Pflager speaks to me as if I 'm an equal and not a little fellow who 'll come up with a laughable statement if a grownup makes enough faces or acts as grownups never do , but Penny is my favorite ; she used to be a registered nurse and when I was ill with rheumatic fever came to our house every day , at twelve noon , and took my temperature and blood pressure , and did , as my mother said , all that it was possible to do . I love the touch of her padded hand across my forehead as much as my mother 's , her smile that puts cushioned dimples in her cheeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail ends of her eyebrows . Her eyes are violet-blue and study you from behind glasses with round gold rims . " You 're worse , you know , " she 'd say when I was worse , but this does n't hide her kindness , which comes from her , like most of the feeling around the Pflagers , with a warmth that 's golden in hue and curve . I 've heard my mother say she often wished Pennyp248did n't have to work  --  Penny handles the dry-goods section of the store , Mr. Pflager the building and hardware supplies  --  because she feels she and Penny could become close friends ; and I 've also heard her say , " Penny 's one of the few people in this town I can talk religion with . " My father and I go into Pflager 's . The wood floor is worn and warped and oil-darkened ; the air smells of linoleum and denim jackets and new boards . " Martin ! " Mr. Pflager cries . " How you be ? " " Fine , " my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but " fine " when he 's asked how he is , and I guess he always is fine ; he has n't been ill in his life , as far as I know , except for strep throat , and that was only once , and he did n't stay home from school for more than a day or two . " What today ? " Mr. Pflager asks . " Your company , first , Eldon , " my father says , and leans his elbows on the countertop , as Mr. Pflager leans across from him , and they begin to talk . My father loves to talk and I 've often felt his real profession is making friends , and that 's why he sells insurance now . I have n't moved since we came in the door . I never do . Just inside , at this end of the counter , is a square display case , with glass sides , that swivels on a pedestal of wood . Inside the case , on velvet-covered shelves , are wristwatches , pocket watches , clocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch comes around . It lies on a middle shelf and I have to look up to it . It 's a wristwatch with a black band that I 've wanted since I could see in the case . Mickey Mouse stands in the center of it in red shorts , with one gold-gloved hand , its forefinger extended , pointing to the minutes , the other the hours . I 've never wanted anything so much in my life . If there were n't a padlock on the case , I 'd have stolen it by now , though I 've never stolen before , not even cantaloupes or gooseberries or pear tomatoes from a neighbor 's garden , as most of the kids do . I know it 's a sin to want an object so much , even if I do n't steal it , and I know this though I 've never taken catechism or been instructed by the Sisters . I feel it 's a sin . The Sisters will have me in first grade soon enough ( although I 'll have to admit that since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll neverp249have to go to school ; and as it turns out , they wo n't have me ) . I used to be afraid of them and ran whenever they came outside ; those white faces looking out from all that black , and gliding toward you as though there were nothing below the black but old curled birds ' claws , rumors of heaven , beads that clashed , and beaks of crows . I dream of faces without arms or legs or anything beneath except black holes and big beads that pop and propel them , and I 'd probably still be afraid but once I was letting Donny Ennis chase me around the playground , and checking over my shoulder to see how far behind he was , when I crashed into the skirts of one of them , and she said , " Oh , little boy , you 've hurt my knee ! " My mother has become a Catholic . After living in this town for ten years without being one , she 's become a Catholic , and I 'm the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell his best friends in hushed tones from the time I was three , that goes , " When Tim was born and Alpha came home from the hospital , one of the first things she did was call me in to her bed and say , ' Martin , I 've decided . I want to take instructions in the faith . I want to become a Catholic . ' And I was stunned . Because here after all these years  --  how many now ?  --  without me saying a word , here it came out of the blue . ' Alpha , ' I said . ' Are you sure ? Are you sure this is what you want ? ' ' Yes , ' she said . ' I 'd like to start seeing Father Schimmelpfennig right away . ' So she 's been seeing Father ever since , although few people but Wilhomena know about it : for three years "  --  this has grown to four years , and then five years  --  " she 's been seeing him ! And she absolutely will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her mind . Father says she 's practically a saint . I 've had no hand in any of this , by the way . " Every time my father reaches this point in his story , which is its end , I see my mother with her hands clasped and a halo around her , like a picture on a holy card , rising through the ceiling , through the upstairs and the roof of the house , and disappearing into the sky , and I wonder , How did I manage to cause this ? What kind of power do I have ? I hardly talk to anybody for fear something worse will happen . And how did this ? She made her First Communion when I was on a vacation to my Grandma and Grandpa Jones 's farm , but I can tell you what she wore : her navyp250high-heeled shoes , the blue dress with white polka dots and wide red belt , and a piece of lace over her hair . She wrote to Grandma Jones about it and told what I have and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Grandma asked , angry , as she read the letter , and I saw moisture behind her glasses , and then she said , in a changed voice , " Well , I imagine your dad is finally satisfied , ha ? " Penny comes from her part of the store , the dry-goods side , and says , " O11 , Martin , hello ! How are you ? " " Fine . " " Where 's Tim ? " " Here . " She comes over and stares down and I feel the violet-blue eyes envelop me with a warmth like flame . Then she sees where I 've been staring  --  I 've even glanced away from her ; I ca n't keep my eyes off it  --  and says , " Why do n't you have your dad pay you a wage so you can buy yourself that watch ? " Like my father in his story , I am stunned ; this has never occurred to me ; I had no idea " Where are you working today ? " " At Schommer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked ! " Down the basement . " " Oh . " " Putting in soil pipe for a new drain . " " How long will it take ? " " Just today , probably . We were there last week . " " Well , when you get on a house , on a big job , go on strike for a quarter an hour ! " " Maybe I 'll try . " " Try nothing . Do it , you hear ! " My father comes over with a string of five-pound ingots of lead and a roll of oakum . " O.K. , helper , " he says . " Let 's go . " We walk to Schommer 's , down the echoing alleyway between Schommer 's and the hardware to the back door of the tavern , and go clown the steps into darkness . He pulls a chain and the basement appears around us as if called . He kneels at the portablewhite-gas furnace that holds the ladle for melting lead , and pumps the plunger at its base before he lights it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plunger a twist and let the leftover air escape in a whish ; it 's dangerous to leave the pressure built up , he 's said . He starts the furnace and its high-pitched whine against the stone walls surrounds us . He tears a five-pound ingot from the strip of five and drops it into the ladle now . He lays a long piece of black soil pipe in the trench he 's dug , lays a level on it , makes a rumbling sound of approval low in his throat , and I bring over the cold chisels  --  one straight , one with a crook below the handle  --  and the ball-peen hammer , and hand them to him . He tears off a length of oakum and begins tamping it into the joint of the soil pipe , all the way around , and when I hear a solid chink of the chisel , I tear off some more oakum and place it in his hand as he reaches behind to me . He takes his cap off by the bill and wipes the sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweat are beginning to form , and moves the unlit cigar he 's chewing to the opposite corner of his mouth . He finishes filling and tamping the joint and I bring over the asbestos rope he 'll fasten around the fitting to hold the lead in place when he pours it around the pipe . He sets a Y on the floor , fits a piece of cut pipe into one branch of it , and I hold it in place for him . He unwinds the oakum from the roll and presses it into the fitting , the black flange turned back . I like the oakum 's tarry , auburn smell ; the salty , steamy smell that rises from him , a metallic smell made more so by the smell of his cigar ; the way he sucks in air at the side of his mouth to keep the cigar clenched tight in his teeth ; being close to his work shirt ; the rainbow-colored whorls forming on the molten lead in the ladle ; the way the furnace does n't send up smoke but makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above him makes his head and shoulders look haloed and ablaze . I know I 'll never ask him for a wage . I do n't want one and do n't want him to give me one , or our relationship would change , and , anyway , since he 's quit teaching , I 've been hearing around our house , more and more , the word " afford . " I know he could n't afford one , and I know , too , how much he loves to work with his hands  --  to build and farm and garden and plumb  --  but I wonder what it was that made him quit teaching ; he was the principal , the next to the highest , and then just quit . Even myp252mother ca n't say . Was I the cause of this , too ? Does n't he think I 'd understand if he explained it to me ? I hear the sound of the furnace , the chink of the chisel , his sucks of air , and watch sweat darken his shirt over his chest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in beads as firm and circular as the beads of molten lead that spill from a fitting and roll in slithering colors over the powdery dirt , and I remember my grandmother reading my mother 's letter to me , and wonder , Is he satisfied ?  |p253Al|pha  went to the window in the pantry at the back of the kitchen , lifted the curtain , and looked down over the hedge toward Main Street ; there was still no sign of him . The moonlight on the leaves and on the deserted walks wet with rain came with fall coldness through the glass to her face , feverish with anxiety and impatience , and she put her cheek against the pane . Two blocks down , a street lamp went on , lighting the side of the Town Hall , and a prowling cat made a blur as it bolted for cover in brown grass . Late with them again tonight . It was after nine and the children were in bed . Delbert Faber came from the shack under the high blue-gray water tower , where he 'd thrown the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the cone of the lamp , trailing illuminated vapors of spent breath , his head bowed , his hands in his pockets , and then did a sudden jogging side step . Drunk again . She 'd hear about it from Mrs. Faber at the next card party , and what could she say to her ? She could n't sympathize with women who complained about their husband 's drinking ; she 'd been through the fruitless world of that with her parents and herself . The only way a man stopped drinking was by taking a look outside himself at the world of his family and this real world ( his interior , as he knew himself , was a hell ) , and if hisp254wife was prattling on about his problem , or scolding or annoyed , or even concerned for his sake when he did look out , then she might as well be off in another century , or be another shot . In the space between pane and sash , on a card there , was a picture of Joseph , Mary , and Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms out like a balanced statue 's  --  and on the other side , the side facing out , were instructions for an act of perfect contrition , followed by a list of life-insurance policies and their average yearly rates , and , at the bottom , in the blunt type of a hand stamp : HOLY FAMILY LIFE INSURANCEMartin Neumiller , AgentP.O . Box 3 CHyatt , North Dakota " Honest as my policies " Surely one of the boys , not Martin , put the card there , she thought , and blushed for him , and then felt exposed to the whole village ; when he told her he was going to start selling insurance , she said , " You 're the perfect one to be selling it ; nobody has a better life . " She let the curtain fall . She 'd defend him against anybody who 'd be charitable about the job . The home office was so pleased with his sales they 'd offered him the area around FargoMoorhead , but he turned it down ; he wanted his children to grow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his father before him , and so on . They sent him on a paid vacation to Custer and the Black Hills with several other agents , but he would n't be moved . He did n't have to be selling insurance in the first place . The president of the board came to the house again this fall and tried to persuade him to take back his teaching job , even hinted that he might be in line for promotion to superintendent , but Martin waved away his words . He would n't teach again until he 'd succeeded or failed at selling insurance , he said , which might take years , and whenever she tried to imagine that future she felt her personality , or inner self , or good sense , or whatever , was loosening at its roots and leaving her and could be swatted like a fly.  |p255Martin  was one of the dozen men in the county with a college degree , and he had a gift for inspiring the young ; they saw in his eyes that they could mature and still retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , necessarily , deception and double-standards and world-weariness and guile . There was a dignity to his innocence , and it brought out trust and fearlessness in others , especially the young , who would n't stand for cant or sham ; but last spring , at the end of the school year , he came to her and said , " I 'm never going to make a decent wage teaching school , and you deserve a better life than this . I 'm going to find a job that makes real money . " " No , no ! " she wanted to cry out , but held herself silent . Fear burns all dreaming . She 'd never interfered with his decisions and never would : " Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as unto the Lord . " That had the rough-tumbling thunder and lightning of Paul in it , and was him , for sure , but was n't even a remote part of her guiding source from above . Martin felt confined by the school and longed to get into the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new people , live outside his wife , be free of the invariable workday ; and when she was a girl , when her family was about to leave another farm , she 'd heard each time an argument as old as time itself : " Why do we have to leave ? " Her mother . " Because we have to ! " Her dad . " Why ? " " Because I 'm not getting ahead . " " Why ca n't you be satisfied for once with what you have ? " " Because I 'm not getting ahead ! " There was no reason that could be used with a man in that condition ; it was more a matter of whether you wanted to be married to him or not . And when she decided to marry Martin , she vowed she would n't sustain the argument any further , for the sake of her sons , if she had sons . Her mother and father had moved again , with Lionell , across the border into Minnesota , because her father believed the opportunities for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she wanted to say to him , Stop . Mama would be satisfied with a sod shack , if you 'd slow down enough to take root in the present , where she 's waiting , as she always has , for a few minutes each day of the straight/forward love you met and courted her with . You take yourself so seriously , Daddy , you 're made of air ! She went into the kitchen and held her hand over the oven vent at the back of the stove . Warmth was still rising from it . What was real in real life ? She smoothed the tablecloth , which was already smooth , and straightened the silverware beside Martin 's plate , and then felt emptied of energy , her current drained down the floor , and sank in a chair and put her face in her hands . She 'd gone over and over the reasons she 'd converted to the Church . It tied her to a past more ordered than hers . She felt her life lengthen backward , watching rituals she knew had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of years happen again ; her mind had new strength and new freedomto roam now ; old fears were given names , others disappeared , and doubts were discarded to gain a new end . The prayers held her within a written framework with her feet on the ground . The Church 's scholarship and its mysteries were beyond the comprehension of any one man and wife , and she felt an infinity of thought and brotherhood about her . Also , it was easy to follow rules set up by somebody else . She 'd balked at the idea of the infallibility of the Pope , and then Father said , " Think of him as far , far off , which he is , and transparent  --  a window you can look through and see the saints . Theirs are the lives to emulate , darling . " But none of this was enough to win her over , by and in itself . She 'd converted because of the feeling of light , a light she sensed but could n't quite see . The more she studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became , until she felt it just above her the way she could feel the sun on her back when she went down into their root cellar on the farm outside Dazey . Since her First Communion , the light had stayed . But now she was pregnant again . At this rate she 'd catch up with the Russells . She 'd become accustomed in their house to luxury of a kind , and when Martin bought the new bedroom set , she started to think how nice it would be to have the clothes she 'd never had , a new stove , an electric sewing machine , and of how she never could if they kept having children . She was willing to try birth control , other than by rhythm , at least once , to see how she felt about it , but NI at tillp257would n't agree . When you were born a Catholic , it was in your bones and blood , while she could believe in a way that Martin was n't able to ; entirely with her mind . Was that pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Maybe her thoughts , through her touch , had been communicated to him and transformed in him into this ambition of late . Or maybe her conversion affected him more than he could comprehend ; he seemed to need to be near his family much more , and they went to Illinois nearly every summer vacation , those three months , and to her parents only over holidays or for a weekend , usually . Martin sometimes adopted an all-inclusive indignant whine that was his mother all over again . He said he did n't want to hear any more of her ideas about religion ; he just wanted to believe . His serpent ? And why had she had the thoughts ? There was such a rush and array of detail to daily life ( to say nothing of the eternity of detail inside your mind ) , when your life was divided among husband and children and houseworkand keeping peace and social obligations and relatives and friends and the community , that there seemed no time or room left for the form there was in her mother 's day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diary now seemed a vain and luxurious excursion into self-idolatry . She went out of the kitchen and through the living room , where the oil heater cast an orange oval onto the linoleum , through the sliding doors into their bedroom , and sat on the bed . Across the room , in the vanity mirror , she could make out her reflection in the near dark , dim and featureless , a bluish form , and it was as if she were seeing through her face to another time . There was a grass-covered plain with nothing on it but a dark shape off in the distance , breaking the line of the horizon high up and thin . The grass was thick and lush green and was swaying and windswept by currents of the universe or a world of different times than this , and then it moved off and was a globe covered with the same grasses , hairlike , current disturbed  --  the earth as it had always been . Her breath caught . No , the view from one of the houses they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember which . Which house . They 'd moved so much then . Oh , houses , help ! " Was n't that pretty ? " she said to her dark reflection , and feltp258her words inside swell up . Martin was too considerate to be a good salesman . He made sure a farmer understood a policy completelybefore he sold it to him . He 'd spend an afternoon in a kitchen or farmyard , clarifying and advising , and then the prospectwould decide he wanted more time to think about it , or say he did n't need a policy at all . So Martin was making less money than when he was teaching . He took part-time jobs to keep them in food and clothes , without having to draw on their savings , and since the spring had been working full time as a farm hand for Evan Savitsky ; during the planting season they plowed until three in the morning , using the tractor headlights to see by , and for two weeks Martin slept over at the Savitskys ' ; these days , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Evan brought him into town at night , drove straight to Main Street , and went into the tavern  --  Eichelburger 's one night , Schommer 's the next , so as not to show favoritism  --  and Martin , who did n't drink and never set foot in either place , had to walk home . She asked him if Evan could n't practice a little restraint and drop him off at home first , and Martin said , " A man should be grateful for what he gets and not expect to get one thing more . " The worst part to her was that he was working with his hands . The country here was so identical from mile to mile , it was the same as the sky above it ; bleached bleak infinity . It was for the buffalo , for grazing creatures and tumbleweed that moved over it like cloud shadow made corporeal by a stroke of the Lord . When men uprooted it and fought it and tried to subdue it to their needs , it became a part of their outlook on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the direction they moved in , and they were never free of the bleakness or the dirt of it ; or if they managed to transcend its encompassing futility and find success , it came in a way that was too unlimited to handle , with so few people to talk to and balance them off , and they saw others only as objects to be used , or not used  --  simply discarded  --  as if success had rendered them all powerful as the land . Rough clods . Servantsof the earth . A hard taskmaster makes the worst sort of slave . You could mold an outlook unattached to it with knowledge from other frames , and now Martin moved down highways or section roads , or through wheat fields or time , with individualp259grace and with " Martin " written all over him . His father would always be a farmer , no matter his present occupation , and her father , for all his travel and boastfulness and womanly bickering and affectations and worldly mind , carried the soul of the land inside him . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stint of summer school again . She lay back on the bed with a hand over her eyes . She was holding herself more at a distance from Martin . Many days she felt relieved when he left the house , even , but the children , and especially Tim , for some reason , filled her with a loneliness that had no limits , no bottom to touch or height to rise above , and then she could n't wait for him to get home . She needed him now . This morning she 'd been thinking about her mother as she looked when she was young , working at the cookstove , hoisting the cold butter crock up from the well , turning down bedclothes , and saw how these simple acts were given dignity and significance by her maternal hand ; and then she remembered her mother 's favorite photograph of her , taken when she was five or six , which her mother had had enlarged and gave as a wedding gift when she married Martin . She 's on the plain in a pair of baggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knees . Her limbs are plump and dimpled . She has on a sunbonnet that 's too big for her , which must be her mother 's , and part of her mother 's affection for the picture . Its ties are hanging loose over her shoulders and throat . She 's smiling into the camera 's eye and holding out a child 's bouquet of black-eyed Susans and blossoming grasses . The sky and the plain are nearly the same shade of gray , and are the only elements in the picture besides her , except for an irregular grayish puff or tuft just above her shoulder , as though rising from the bonnet , which must be a tree . The more she thought of her mother , the more real the picture became , as if the sun were appearing from behind a cloud , and just when it seemed that all of the details were as lifelike as on the day the picture was snapped , she , the girl in jumpers , turned and walked out of sight . All that was left was the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . She sensed the nearness of Martin and was up out of the bed ;  |p260she  listened a second , and then started toward the other end of the house , and was passing the oval of the oil heater , when somebodystarted rapping at the back door . Who ? When Martin got home , he came into the side porch , where he left his work clothes , and into the kitchen that way , never through the back door . She lifted the curtain and looked ; the porch was empty , bare . A broom stood . The back door , like the others , was unlocked . Then the rapping came again , and was so close and loud it startled her . Only a neighbor , she thought , but as she went toward the door her knees weakened and sent tremors up inside her inner thighs . She opened the door enough to see out . " Boo , " Martin said . He was below her at the bottom of the steps , a smile on his dust-colored , sweat-streaked face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth are you doing back here ? " she asked , and was surprised at the alarm in her voice . " This , " he said , and lifted his arm and held out a brace of pheasants . Their green heads and shimmering breast feathers gleamed in the dim light , and the shifting eye rings were like poppies to her . " Where did you get those ? " " Hunting ! Where do you think ? " " You 've been hunting ? " " Evan took me . Are n't they beauties , hon ? " His deep bass voice made a dense sound within the confines of the lean-to porch . He went to the edge of the swath of light from the kitchen , reached up , located a strand of wire on the low roof , and wrapped the wire around the pheasants ' legs . They swung noiselessly from side to side , and then one wing outstretched and sliced into the light . " I 'll leave them there , " he said . " I can clean them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it now . " " No , they 'll be all right . It 's plenty cold out . Well , maybe I should bleed them . No , no , it 's too late for that . Oh , they 'll be all right here . We 'll have some for supper tomorrow night , and I 'll take the rest to the locker , if there are any rest left . " He came up the steps and she went to embrace him , but he held up his hand . " You 'd better wait for that till I wash first . I'tnp261filthy . " He tossed his cap onto the counter beside the sink . " How have you been ? " " The same . " " And the kids ? " " Fine . " " It 's too bad I hardly get a chance to see them any more . " " Yes . " He dipped water from the pail into the basin in the sink and she saw his broad back as it swung from vessel to vessel ( the municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was disturbedthat he 'd been hunting ; it was the first time in five years . Five seasons ago , his closest friend other than Father , Ivan Savitsky , Evan 's older brother , went pheasant hunting with his hired man , a full-blooded Sioux , and they got more than their limit and stopped in a roadside bar to celebrate and boast , and bought two cases of beer , and on their way home , on the curve outside Bowdon , went off the road in the car and rolled several times and were thrown from it and killed . Martin drove out when he heard and came home diminished and shaken , and said , " I 'll never hunt again . Every time I lift a shotgun , I 'll see that ditch . There were beer bottles and shotgun shells and blood and pheasant feathers everywhere . And them . " Sometime later , when they went around the same curve in their car , she saw a pair of diamond-shaped signs with black X 's on them , and they remindedher of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar accident , at one time , in the same car , too much for her now . Martin looked over his shoulder . " Are you all right ? " he asked . " Is everything all right , dear ? " " Yes . " " Are you sure ? " " Yes . " " What a day ! " He put his glasses on the counter and plunged his hands into the basin and rubbed his face until his skin squeaked . She took the food out of the oven , put it on the table , and sat in a chair facing his . The inadequacies of the mind , or else its omniscience . What was it trying to tell us in times of confusion ? Was it a friend ?  | " Just after lunch , when Evan and I were getting the tractors ready , Evan 's neighbor , Frank Crimmins , drove up . I figured something was brewing . Crimmins does n't usually get out of bed until noon , and then he loafs around the house while his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half section of land and has n't even got his hay in yet ! " Well , he drove up and said that the pheasants were thick as grass down around Pingree . He said the three of us deserved the day off  --  that was some way of putting it , when you consider Evan has six sections to get in before the freeze , and that I have no say in it , and that Crimmins is perpetually off  --  he said we deserved the day off and should take it off , by Lord , and go get some pheasants for ourselves before the sportsmen came up from all over and took them from us . Oh , he can talk a stream . " Evan asked me if I 'd like to go , which surprised me . I know he 's afraid of falling behind this year , even with me on as a hand , and then Ivan  --  But there 's a split in that man ! " Martin turned his glistening face to her , looking blind without his glasses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second place to him if there 's an opportunity for some sport . Crimmins saw that , too , and started fast-talking again . I told Evan I did n't have a license and , anyway , had sold my gun since  --  He said I did n't need a license and could use his old 2o-gauge . He was already convinced . " Martin slipped his glasses on and leaned against the washstand and crossed his arms . " But he would n't leave that easily , either , not Evan . No , we were out by the gas tank , greasing up the tractors , as I said , and he pointed out a chicken by the garden , about thirty feet off , and whispered , See that ? Watch . I 'll check with the powers that be and see if my aim 's on . If it 's on , we go . If it 's not , to hell with it . ' " He held up the gun and gave it a hard pump , and the chicken took off squawking , flapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Oh , oh , ya ha ! It just goes to show you the luck that man has ! So we got out the guns , took off in separate cars , and went down to Pingree , and within an hour we all had our limit , all three of us , and that 's not all . I got some work done on my own , too . "  |p263He  came up and kissed her along the forehead . " But , you . What about you ? How was your day ? " " Fine . " " You did n't get overtired again ? " " No . " " You 're sure you 're not ? " " Yes , I 'm sure . " He passed his hand over her hair , and she glanced up and saw him staring beyond her at the wall clock . " Is it that late ? " He sat and helped himself to the peas and potatoes and canned-salmon loaf . " I 'd better get moving , then . I 'll be late the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork hesitated in the air and his large eyes , nearly circular in their intensity , studied her in disbelief . " What for ? It 's Friday night ! " " Oh . I forgot . " " You made salmon loaf ! " " The other , I mean . " On Fridays he played pinochle with Dr. Koenig , Eldon Pflager , William Runyon , and a dozen other parishioners , at Father Schimmelpfennig 's . " You should know by now I 'm as regular as clockwork , " he said , and clucked his tongue . " I mentioned getting some other work done . Evan dropped me off at the Stahls ' and Hyerdahls ' . I 've told you about them . " His voice suddenly drew away and became more guarded on her . " They 're both on the line for new policies , and I talked with them while Evan waited the car for me . Then we tried to finish up an eighty with the pony drills . Then the rain came . I 'm sorry I 'm late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive Hyerdahl will buy , and that 'll be the third policy this month . Wo n't that be nice ? " " It will . " " Weell , " he said , prolonging the word in the local farmers ' way , so it sounded nearly like " wheel , " which irritated her , and then pushed his plate aside . " I 'd better get going now . " lie went back to the bedroom to put on a suit . She cleared the table and dumped the oily , grayish water out of the washbasin , and then took down an aluminum pan and started the dishes inp264the sink . Hands , strong and warm , smelling of after-shave , gripped her shoulders hard . She turned , startled and annoyed , and the annoyance stayed as she studied him , sharpening her perception of his necktied chest and face and lips , and then she was angry at herself for being aroused . " Are you sure you 're all right ? " he asked . " Yes . You frightened me . " Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then leaned and lifted her and she turned her face , grazing his close stubble with her chin , and fitted her mouth to the familiar shape of his . Then her feet touched and she stepped back and could n't look at him . " Alpha , it 's the only time I ever go out in this town . " " I know . " " I have two cigars , and most nights win a couple dollars , especially with Father as my partner , and those dollars help . " " I know that . Go on . " " I 'll stay if you insist . " " No , go your way . " He went to the door and snapped its lock for a change . " Why do n't you wait up for me ? " He backed down the steps looking uncomfortable and ashamed and closed the door . She breathed out and leaned against the sink to ease the moist swelling in her and a nimbus formed around the light bulb above the table , and then trembled and sent out shafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of avoiding whatever he was afraid of . What if she 'd taken the time to tell him about the picture , and how she 'd felt about it ? She probably never would now . She wiped her cheek with the heel of her hand and straightened her dress . She would n't be weak like every other woman she knew , all of whom she hated . She grabbed up an oleomargarine package and broke the pellet of dye at its center and squeezed and kneaded the package until the lard-colored margarine turned a uniform gold , then threw the package on the counter , went into the living , room , switched on her lamp , sat in her rocker , and took The Ordeal of Richard Feverel off the table and opened it at her marker , a scrap of dress material ; Adrian , the wise , fat , self-anointed phi/losopher , was giving another blowhard 's lecture to young Richard . She closed the book with a bang . On the wall across the room was a set of corner shelves Martin 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with them he 'd enclosed a white statuette of an elephant , which tasted , she discovered , like alum , or worse . The boys wanted it for their playroom , but she put it up on the shelves when Martin installed them . They were such a clutter now she could n't see the thing . She moved her tongue over a canker sore to a molar at the back of her mouth that was so hollowed out she could fit the tip of her tongue into its sharp-edged crater . She hoped none of her children inherited her teeth . The worst sins of avarice and ambition and greed rose out of poverty , somebody said . " For the love of money is the root of all evil . " Paul again . There was a knock again at the back door . Martin . He 'd decided not to play cards . Home with her . She ran into the kitchen and unlocked the door and pulled it wide . A tall man with a hooked nose and a shock of curly hair showing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the top step , only inches from her  --  the young man who 'd bought the lot across from their garden , dug a basement with a tiling spade , built a little house , and moved into it in the spring with his new wife . She was so sure it would be Martin she might as well have embraced the kid . Man . He raised the bill of his cap . " Hi . " " Hello . " " Is your husband in ? " " No . " " Oh . Well , I was out hunting today and got my limit of pheasants , and it 's too much for just my wife and I , so we were wondering if you folks might like a couple of them . " " We would , usually , any other time  --  " She looked up and saw that his brown eyes , moist in the light , were studying her with a calculating , interested stare . One eye was slightly crossed in a handsome way . She made a gesture over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his limit , too . " Ile slid his hands into his back pockets , his elbows turned out , and began swinging them back and forth . " You wo n't need any more front me then , I guess . "  | " No , I 'm sure not . " " My wife , she said I should come and ask , so here I am , asking . " He made an amused gurgle at the back of his throat . " Thank you . " " You 're welcome . " She stared at the floor , conscious of his eyes traveling over her hair , her face , the front of her dress , and felt like saying , with her father 's fire , Are you the sort who 'd take on a mother of four who 's got another in the oven ? " Maybe I 'll go see old Runyon , " he said . " I doubt if he hunts , and they might like some of these there then . " He held up his hand . Another bouquet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll be away at Father 's . You could ask his wife . " " I will ask her . " " Well , thank you . " " You 're welcome again . " She closed the door , her heart beating hard inside her dress , went to the rocker and took her sewing basket and threaded a needle with trembling fingers , and then worked a light bulb down into the toe of a stocking lying in her lap , which looked big as a floor . The stocking was one of Martin 's that dated from Tim , and if it were worn any thinner she 'd be darning air . " Mom ? " The voice came from the boys ' bedroom . She waited to make sure that whoever of them had called was awake . Boys ' dreams . The frittering they should let be done . " Mom ? " It was Charles , awake , so she moved her thighs to move the basket , stood , put it in her rocking rocker and went heavily over and set the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " Still the alarm in her voice . " Is Dad home yet ? " " No . Now , go back to sleep . " " I thought I heard him talking . " " You could n't have . He 's not here . " " Where is he then ? " " Was somebody else here ? "  | " No , nobody . Go to sleep now . Good night . " " Turn on the light . I ca n't see your face . I want to see it . " " It 'll wake your brothers , you fool . " " I 'm awake . " The voice of Jerome beside her . " Why do n't you tell us a story , and maybe Dad ' 1l be back by then . " Why did she lie to them ? Why did Jerome always have an idea of what to do ? " We 'd wake Tim , " she said . " Tim ? " Jerome said . " I doubt it . Tim sleeps like the dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was true , perhaps , metaphorically at least , and , in any case , she did n't care whether Tim woke ; she needed the company of them all . She found the pin-up lamp inside the door and twisted its switch and light fell over the foot of Jerome and Charles 's double bed ; gray clipper ships sailing out over silver blue . She went to the cot along the wall in semi-darkness , where Tim lay , and covered him better , and then sat on the edge of the older boys ' bed . " Now , then . What is it here ? " " Just a story , " Jerome said . " Where 's Dad ? " Charles asked . " At Father Schimmelpfennig 's . " " What 's the matter ? " Charles asked . " Nothing . " " Is something the matter with Dad ? " " No , nothing 's the matter with him . " " Well , if he 's at Father 's , was n't he home first to change ? " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was . " " Was he in and out so fast you almost forgot ? " Jerome asked . " Just about . " She bowed her head . Now . What ? " Tell us about Grandpa Jones and the billy goat , " Jerome said , and grinned at the story , which he knew by heart . " No , " Charles said , forgetting everything to rise above Jeromeand see her more fully . " Tell about yourself , when you went totown on the pony you bought for Lionell , and it was snowing . " " I 'll tell them both . " They struggled around in a noisy uproar of covers until they were sitting with their backs against the headboard . Jerome brushed his hair aside and she saw that the youthful blond was going front it , and that they both needed haircuts again . Theirp268eyes were as luminous as their father 's and fixed on her with his intensity for the sign that meant she 'd begin , but a current of feeling scattered the order in her and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , God ! " she cried . " What ? " " Mom ! What 's the matter ? " She saw the pheasants ' plumage catching the light from the kitchen as they swung from the wire , and that other light , the light she sensed above her , dimmed and for a moment was gone , and she felt that a shadow of harm would fall from her over Martin and the children and be lifted away , when it was lifted , by hands other than hers . How could hands other than hers , which had helped shape them , hold them from harm ? There was a rustle from the cot across the room , and Tim sat up , his eyes startled and wide , and cried , " Mom ! Hey , Mom , what are you doing with those two guys ? "  |p269The  Neumillers are on the road to the farm the Joneses have moved to , near Osage , Minnesota . Their car , a ' 47 Chevrolet bought second-hand from Father Schimmelpfennig , is arranged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles , with a steamer trunk wedged in the well between front and back seats and covered with blankets , so the boys can lie down and sleep if they wish , and pillows piled everywhere . Marie alternates between the front and the back , depending upon her whims , and Alpha , six months pregnant , sits in the passenger seat and orchestrates the moods of the children and the moodiness that comes over Martin when he has to drive with all six of them in the car . Outside Valley City , out of the violet sky , snowflakes appear in a tentative stir , and beyond Moorhead come down in a flurry and form a shifting screen around them as the wind picks up and begins to wail across the flatlands of the Red River Valley . Snow goes slithering over the road in snaking sheets and makes the slow-moving car appear to be traveling sidewise . In bordering fields billows of it rise like many-headed , amorphous ghosts and turn into a wind-carried curtain over fifty feet high , with edges that ca n't be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping over drifts where cornstalks show ,  |p270|past  a telephone pole , a snow fence , and hits the side of the car . It yaws and shudders on bad shock absorbers . They adjust their winter coats . Most other cars have left the road , but an occasional semi comes barreling past in the opposite lane , dragging behind it a long concussion of sound that for a moment knocks the snow aside . Jerome and Charles kneel , their elbows on the front seat , and cheer the trucks , and call out the names of towns  --  Dilworth ! Glyndon ! Hawley !  --  until Martin tells them to sit back and be quiet so he can concentrate on the road . He leans toward the wheel , as if the inclination can bring them to their destination quicker , and wipes at the icing windshield with the backs of his bare fingers . He scratches at it with his nails . Dorsals of snow begin to rise from the road like spines and fins of creatures rising from below , and thud under the tires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George . Tim lies down on the trunk . There 's a heater fan below the driver 's seat , which he 's often inspected by laying his face on the fibery bristles of the floor mat , and he can hear its whir and tinny blades tinging against candy wrappers and cigar cellophanes . He feels the warm draft of it above the trunk . In half sleep he remembers waking like this with the sound of water sloshing . It lay in the floor well and spotted the dun fuzz of the seats . He rose and saw a gray plain of it as high as the car bumper in every direction , blended with a dim sky by a bright mist . " Where are we , Dad ? " " West Fargo , I think . " A man in fishing waders and a black slicker came floundering out of the mist , splashed over a guardrail , and leaned slipping on the driver 's side . His eyes were wandering and hard . Tim 's father cranked the window down past him . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The man 's eyes would n't focus anywhere . " What 's this ? " " A flood . A flood . Go back . Sandbags gone . " He slipped and almost fell , and shook his head to clear it . " My Lord , man , " Tim 's father said . " How long have you been up ? " " Three days , " the man said , and slipped again with a splash . Tim falls asleep.  |p271Charles  , angered because he ca n't see the countryside , lies down on a pile of pillows and falls asleep . Jerome feels like a sentinel guiding the car and keeps his eyes on the road until his father says , " Ah , thank God , here 's the turnoff , is n't it ? " " Yes . " His father heaves a tremulous sigh and Marie cries out , as if to share his release , and throws her arms around him . The road swings away , fence posts , the clutch pedal making a wallop , evergreensacross the window in spiky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends Jerome flying , the car goes backwardinto the ditch . Its nose points toward flake-streaked blue , the Minnesota sky , and it 's balanced so precariously it rocks from wheel to wheel as his father grabs for the keys to shut it off . Marie is screaming . " My stars , " Alpha says . " Is anybody hurt in here ? " Nobody says they 're hurt . " Is everybody sure they 're all right ? " she says . " Move around a little . But do n't jump up and down ! We 're on a seesaw here . " Marie screams and the boys say , Yes , Yes , Yes , sure , of course they 're all right . " Well , I 'm not , not yet , " Martin says . " Let me sit a minute till I stop shaking . I was sure we 'd roll . " " We 're lucky , " Alpha says , and laughs . " Oh ? " he says . " I 'll have to walk to the folks now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with the tractor to get us out of this . What is it to their place from here ? A mile , would you say ? " " More like two , dear , " she says , and laughs again . " I better get going , then , before this storm gets worse . " She pulls out extra blankets and dispenses them . He eases out , letting in flakes that melt where they settle on the seat and dash , stops the car 's seesawing , and slams the door . He waves , and then takes off in a trot down the road , and soon is engulfed as if by smoke . Alpha turns in her seat . " You back there , all three of you , I want you to thank your guardian angels right now that none of you were hurt . " Guardian angel ? Jerome thinks . Goodness , I have n't believed in a guardian angel since I was seven.  |p275One  winter later , Martin 's only consolation until the end of January was a line he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a classroom scene from Hamlet : " When sorrows come , they come not single spies , but in battalions . " And after January there was no consolation . The sorrows began even before they moved from North Dakota . One morning he read a letter at the breakfast table with all of them present , including Susan , the baby , who was learning to sit up and behave in her high chair . The letter was from his father , who 'd incorporated his business and moved to Forest Creek , and was building a new house there ; only the basement of it was completed , he said , so they 'd set up temporary housekeeping in it , which was rough , what with Tom and Davey , though twenty and fourteen , at one another so much it made it seem the whole family was there ; but the main reason he wrote was to say that Forest Creek had formed a consolidated school here with Pettibone , and now the school board was looking for a new principal . Alan Spear , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 and ' 40 , was president of the board and had said that Martin 's qualifications sounded perfect . Would he apply ? He folded the letter and turned to her . Well ? Well ? Since he 'd gone back to teaching , was n't he satisfied withp276the job he had ? Oh , of course , but there was n't much chance of getting ahead in North Dakota , especially in a village this size . Was n't he the superintendent of the high school now ? Yes , that was true . And did n't he make enough to keep them happy ? More than enough . Then would it be wise to give up the job he had , and give up the house , and move to Illinois , where it was so hot and humid , when a job had n't actually been promised him yet ? Did n't she like Illinois ? Not especially . Well , they 'd only been there in the summer , and he imagined that was why . At first his father had n't liked it either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once . Then why did he come back to North Dakota so often ? Well , North Dakota was his home state . And was n't it theirs ? Yes , sure , but his father had done so well for himself down there , and maybe they could , too . Would n't she like a nicer house ? This was the house she 'd always wanted ; how could there be a better one ? Well , his only reason for considering the idea at all was that his father was getting older and wanted the family reunited ; she knew that , did n't she ? Yes , she said . And anyway , he 'd always felt they 'd moved to Illinois themselves , back in ' 38 when the family moved , and they 'd be in Illinois right now if she had n't come walking across that wheat field with the telegram from Rynerson here at Hyatt . She knew that , did n't she ? Yes , she said . He took her hand in his . Would n't she like it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money and she could have more friends ? She bowed her head the way she did only when she was unhappy or very ashamed , as if she 'd heard the news she 'd waited for until this moment in her life . She said the one situation she would n't tolerate was living for any length of time with his parents . Oh , of course not ! She 'd heard what his father had said about Tom and Davey and the new house , had n't she ? The situation in that basement would n't be fit for another footstool , much less them . She could n't impose four children and an infant on his parents , now that they were growing older and their own children , or at least most of them , had moved out and were living away from home ; his parents were ready to return -o the state that couplesp277can share only twice in their lives  --  before any children are born , and after all of the children are gone . " You 'll take this job , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to do after that is find us a place to live . " " I will , Alpha . Goodness gophers ! " He went to Illinois and interviewed with Spear and Spear said the job was as good as his . There were few houses to be found  --  nobody seemed to move in or out of the area much  --  but he finally came across a six-room , semi-furnished bungalow in Pettibone , with a yard of box hedge and flower-bordered paths ( a quaint touch ) , which would be comfortable enough until he was established in the job ; the rent was fifty-five dollars a month , and the owners of the house , an elderly and reserved but decent country couple , promised to sell any pieces of furniture Alpha might want for a matter of dollars . They were moving back to their farm outside Forest Creek and had all the furniture they wanted in the farmhouse there , they said . While he was in Illinois , he also found a mover , a trucker , actually , who did commercial hauling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of years , and the man offered to move him for such a reasonable price he could n't refuse . He went back to North Dakota with good news for Alpha and the family , and a new house . The trucker arrived ten days late . He was hauling lime for corn and could n't leave Illinois when he wanted , he said , and during the time they waited they lived out of boxes that had already been packed , and slept on mattresses from the dismantledbeds  --  an adventure for the boys , but for Alpha barely endurable . She was pregnant again . Father offered a room in his house to her and the girls , but Alpha said no ; she wanted to be with the children ; she wanted all of them together for now . Then the trucker finally did pull into the drive , and Martin saw he 'd been a fool to attempt to save money by hiring the fellow ; his two trucks were n't moving vans but open farm trucks fitted with cattle racks . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alpha said . The trucker and his driver were tired from the trip and slept on the floor over night and shaved the next morning in a bath/room bare except for fixtures , while Charles and Tim stared at them as though they 'd never seen a man shave . Had n't they ever watched him , Martin wondered . He helped the truckers load the big pieces first . " Take good care of my piano ! " Alpha cried . Father came over in the afternoon and supervised , and then Dr. Koenig and his wife showed up , then the Pflagers and the Runyons and the Ianacconas , and Wilhomena and Mrs. Liffertthenthe Savitskys with baskets of chicken and potato salad for a picnic , and by the time the trucks pulled out for Illinois , there were a few dozen townspeople , and at least as many children , in their hedge-bordered yard ; the adults kept up a cheerful-seeming chatter , but the children  --  the Rimskys , the Schonbecks , Everett Ritter , Susie Eichelburger , Douglas Kuntz  --  stood off at a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tim were strangers who 'd survived some sort of accident and were still touched by their brush with death , and were meant to be merely observed . And then Jake Ennis , Donny 's father , drove up in the county road grader , hopped down from its high yellow cab , and came over and said thank you and then goodbye to Alpha and Tim . Father had held a farewell party for Alpha and Martin two weeks before and most of these people had been there , and seeing them now was too difficult and complicated to be borne by somebody who could say goodbye only once , if then , like Martin . He looked over their heads toward Alpha . She was giving the baby to Mrs. Pflager , and then she went over and took Jerome and Charles by the hands and turned away , and he realized that she wanted to walk through the house one last time with them , which he saw as the perfect way to help bring this part of their boyhood to an end , and then somebody took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got them into the car , at last , in a daze , and drove away from the house with their friends standing in the yard waving hands and handkerchiefs and crying , " Good luck at the new place ! Good luck ! Good luck ! " They were out of town and onto the straight-edge of the highway , and had passed the trucks burdened with their belongings and covered with tarps , when hep279said , to ease the silence among them , " Well , did you see anything in the house that we missed or left behind ? " " No , " Alpha said . " Yes , sir , " Jerome answered . " There was a Fargo Forum right in the middle of the living-room floor . " " Hunk ! " Martin said , and for some reason could n't remove from his mind the image of that newspaper lying alone in the big empty house . It was crowded with them all in the car , along with their luggage , plus the necessities to care for a one-and-a-half-year-old ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung wildly at them once in the back seat with one hand on the wheel , something he 'd vowed never to revert to . Susan was wailing most of the way and was so restless it was a torture for Alpha , who was four months along , to have to hold her in her lap . And Marie wanted to be there also , since that 's where Susan was , not knowing yet how to compete with a girl , and a younger one at that . They drove straight through and arrived in Illinois at 3 A.M. , too unreasonable an hour to stop at his parents ' , and went to the house he 'd rented in Pettibone . " I ' 11 open it up and get the lights on , " he said . " Then we 'll take some of this in and make it a little comfortable . It does n't look as bad inside . They know we want to buy at least two of their beds , so that many will be here . " He went onto the porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be left , and found his nails scraping tin . Then he heard voices inside . He stepped to a window , cupped his hands , and was looking into eyes that widened and went retreating from him . Whose ? The porch light came on . Hinges creaked , and an elderly man , the owner , stood behind the screen door in undershorts . What 's happened to him , Martin wondered ; he 'd gained at least thirty pounds , his face shining fat , and there was such unyielding defiance in his eyes his pupils appeared red . " This is some hour to show up , " the man said . " What do you mean ? Here you are and we agr  --  " " ' I'lie wife 's had a change of heart . " " But it 's July twenty-fifth ! " Martin said , as though the date could make the man 's pounds disappear until he vanished.  | " You 've had two weeks to be out ! My wife , my kids  --  " He turned toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Alpha 's pale face , like a pale constellation , shining out from behind the car window on him . " The wife 's decided we 're staying here in town , and that 's that . " " Why did n't you at least let me know , for God 's sake ? " " I lost that card of yours . " " Why did n't you tell my father ? " " Who 's he ? " " But surely you ca n't  --  I mean , my Lord ! I 've paid the first month 's rent and the deposit ! " " Take it easy . " The man shifted back and was invisible in the darkness . A light deeper in the house went on , it went off , and then the screen door creaked out and the man handed him a sheaf of bills , and Martin knew without counting that it was his one hundred and ten dollars . The screen door quickly closed and was locked fast . " Just what the hell do you think you 're doing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house . " " I mean  --  " Martin stared into his eyes and had an impulse to put out the light in them , blast at them through the screen and do the man the violence of the bloodiest of his dreams , but this was his fault ; he 'd done business as he always had , on his word and a handshake , which he 'd never do again . He turned away and went down the porch and out the walk toward the celestial geometry of the children around Alpha 's waiting face . There was no recourse . They went to his parents ' to spend the night ; they stayed on . They stored their furniture in an unfinishedgarage attached to the half-finished house and covered it with tar paper , blankets , and rugs that they unpacked . There was nothing for rent in the area that was n't too small or frailly falling apart , or priced beyond their means , so he decided to find a place to buy instead , on the basis of his job , and started searchingin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gradually feltp281the search become halfhearted , helpless , without hope , conducted mostly for Alpha 's sake , as he walked through tumbledown farmhouses and lemons and white elephants , thinking that when he wrote that book of his , this chapter would have to be headed " The Way Things Happen to Me Now . " And while he looked , his parents and Tom and Davey and Alpha and himself and the children  --  eleven in all  --  slept and cohabited and tried to sort out themselves and their lives in the basement . Only one room of it was partitioned off , the room his parents slept in , and hanging up blankets for privacy was a joke , and then not a joke , and then abandoned . The meals were picnics outdoors , unless it was raining , and then they ate off card tables or the maze of their many-sized beds . A plastic curtain was strung across one corner where there was a floor drain , forming a makeshift shower that was used by everybody except the little girls , who had their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were assigned each night by Martin 's father . A blight of box-elder bugs moved in from the State Forest at the edge of town , and Alpha , who 'd never seen the insect , was appalled by its roachlike appearance . Trunks of trees appeared to pulse and waver from the black-and-orange-shaded masses of bugs in motion on them ; they dropped from branches onto the picnic tables , into hair and food , and traveled so much on the sidewalks you could n't step anywhere without crushing some , and covered one sun-warmed side of the house in a trembling epithelium . They got inside and down to the basement , which was perpetually damp and smelled of lime and cement paint and the overworked sump hole , and that week Alpha and the baby went to bed with bad colds . The boys dug a foxhole in one corner of the yard , camouflaged it with branches , and slept in it on the nights when it was n't raining . One day they 'd enlarged it to twice its size and were digging tunnels off its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing that ? " Martin asked . " You 're ruining Grandma and Grandpa 's yard . " " Grandpa said it 's O.K. This has n't been landscaped yet . " They were picking up a technical jargon from his father , who let then- trail after him while he worked and answered theirp282questions with thoroughness and absolute patience . Martin felt he gave only commands and that they were wearying of him as a father . " But why make it bigger ? Somebody could fall in and get hurt . Why ca n't you leave it the way it was ? " " We 're building a house . " They 'd go crawling through the caves and labyrinths formed by the furniture in the garage , and spend hours searching for a particular piece they remembered and missed , and then emerge dazed in the sunlight , sullen and bewildered , as if they 'd been tricked into believing their lives were intact . Davey built a tree house in the branches of an old oak , and there he sometimes slept . He 'd attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattled as he turned a crank ; he had war-surplus materials and souvenirs that Fred and Jay ( whom Davey called " Dingle " ) had brought back from overseas , and he and Jerome and Charles were always dressed up in Army equipment and shooting at one another . Would Jerome and Charles , born during a war and aware of the newly awakened force that had ended it , be marked by that in any way , Martin wondered . Oh , probably not , but merely to have to speculate about its effects on them added to his guilt and sense of failure as a father . I ) id they think him unmanly because he had n't served in the war ? He was the last male school administrator left in a three-county area at the time of the Battle of the Bulge , and was expecting at any moment to be called up , when the president of the school board came to him and said there was a movement underway to get him a deferment . He said he did n't want one , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no hand in it , but the board seemed determined and must have gone ahead with its plans ; he was never called up . When he was n't looking for a house , he worked part-time for his father or for Jay , who was a plastering contractor , and once spent fourteen hours tiling a church basement ; being on his knees for so long seemed to exacerbate an old injury : when he was twelve , he 'd been thrown from a hayrake and hit a rock with his right knee . It had n't bothered him for twenty-five years  --  indeed , he 'd forgotten it ; it was his fattier who reminded him  --  but now he felt heated cinders were being pressed against hisp283kneecap whenever he put weight on the leg , and his knee became so inflamed it would n't flex . A doctor from Pettibone , the only doctor around , a wateryeyed , evasive man who seemed so rich with ideas of treatment it was a trial for him to decide on one , put heat packs on the knee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills and a series of injections ; then decided the knee would have to be lanced , so he lanced it in the basement , without anesthetic , and then lanced it again , and lanced it yet a third time in still another spot . The swelling stayed . Martin had to walk with a cane and be helped up and down stairs , and began to feel like an old man near the end of his life . Ed Jones without the vinegar in him . He 'd wake in the middle of the night , groaning with pain , and realize from the tenseness around that he 'd waked everybody in the basement . And then his mother caught Jerome and Charles smoking in the foxhole , and brought them to him , pulling each by an ear , and said it was a disgrace for children their age to be smoking cigarettes . Martin agreed as she shoved the boys down in front of him and went off . He 'd caused such uncertainty and confusion in their lives , he 'd have to remedy it soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , prodded the floor with his cane , and said , " Please , boys , please do n't smoke till you 're older . Especiallyaround Grandma , promise ? " One night as he lay awake in the basement , empty of the desires that had kept him awake as a young man ( for he no longer felt young ) , he recalled , with a clarity that made him wipe away the recollection , that some of the happiest times in Alpha 's life had been when they moved . He found a house at last , or , rather , his father found one , in Pettibone ; a long , plain , unhandsome place at an angle across one corner of a block , facing a busy intersection . A concrete drive abutted against its front foundation and fanned out to the streets on either side . In the thirties or forties the place had been somebody'sgrandiose notion of a service station ; there was a large central part , a small house in itself , with a second story and a basement , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching wings extending from either side of it  --  **26;2062;TOOLONG you to the Rim , where I shall debark in order to instigate a study of conditions prevailing upon that frontier . " " Oh , " said Urgo . To Pazilliwheep : " He says we 'll be stuck there for at least two or three months . " " Oh ! " said the navigator-pilot , rather more pungently . " Will you ask his unblessed bureaucratship why the inferno he wants to excrete away so loving much time on one unseemly little ball of fertilizer ? "  --  likewise rather more pungently . " No fair , " grumbled Urgo . " I ca n't talk to him like that . " Klak't'klak explained . He was n't really much interested in 143 . His primary mission was to make sure that things were going well on the civilized planets of the Rim , and recommend remedies to the Federation authorities for whatever he found amiss . Still , 143 was overdue for inspection  --  seeing that it housed one nation that belonged to the great confraternity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because a galactic-scale league is necessarily a loose one , little more than a set of agencies serving the common interests of wildly diverse cultures . But a member is entitled to some things : for example , technicalassistance if it wishes to modernize in any way . " No , " said Pazilliwheep , " our friends on 143 are n't what you would call the go-getter type . They 're content to sell us their services , use of landing space , a few kinds of goods . Mainly they take biologicalsin exchange  --  you know , longevity pills and , uh , other medicines . Ask them yourself if you doubt my word . " " I do not , of course , " Klak't'klak answered through Urgo . " But I gather the planet holds numerous cultures . Perhaps they are being treated unfairly . Might they not , for example , be worthy of Federationmembership too ? " " Chaos , no ! " Pazilliwheep paused . " Well , I suppose they 're no worse than some I could name . But no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traders , in the hope of finding new potential markets . But the majority of 143ans have n't shown any improvement in the more than two centuries that the blob 's been visited . They 've got a drab , fragmented , quarrelsome , early-mechanical kind of civilization . Last time I was there , we noticed traces of manned landings on the single moon . That indicates the stage they 're at . If they learned the Federation exists  --  " " They would have to be admitted to membership if they asked . "  | " Exactly ! And can you imagine the results ? Those dismal characterswould yell for so much technical assistance that their whole planet would be one gigantic college for the next fifty years . Sector taxes would go up ten percent , I 'll bet , to finance it . We 'd have to stop using our base , probably , because of their confounded nationalisticregulations about passports and I do n't know what other nonsense . And there is n't as handy a planet for us within a hundred light-years . " Pazilliwheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part for what ? To add one more lousy space-traveling species  --  competing right in our trade lanes to the Rim ! " " You are satisfied with the status quo , then ? " " Right . The 143ans who do know about us and do have membershipare friendly , dignified , unaggressive , mind-their-own-business people who 'll work for us when we need help at an honest wage for honest labor , and who produce salable handicrafts . Do you wonder that we hide our existence from everyone else ? " " No . Frankly , I can not help suspecting you underpay your nativehelp ; that is what honest wage for honest labor ' usually means . But I am more concerned with ascertaining whether the planet has other civilizations that would , on balance , prove an asset to the Federation . Rather than read the sporadic reports of untrained and biased observers , I want to investigate and decide for myself . " Even through Urgo 's translation , Pazilliwheep noted how Klak ' - t'klak had dropped his elegant periods for shorter sentences in a sharper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , he 'd be hung up for a while on 143 , chauffeuring the Sector Inspector around , assisting with instruments , catching natives for interviews . ( This was done in such wise that , after they were released , no one believed their story . Experience had shown that the best ploy on 143 was the Benign Observers of Elder Race . ) He and Urgo would be at once busy and bored . Yet . . . eventually they 'd start drawing overtime pay . And the mission on 143 would n't likely be prolonged . If nothing else , Grumdel Castle was uncomfortable . Her cramped cabins , vibrating decks , rusty metal , chipped plastic , wheezy ventilators , and uninspired galleysaw to that . In addition , she carried so few books and tapes suitable for Klak't'klak that he would have them memorized in weeks . Pazilliwheep and Urgo always laid in recreational materials before ap42voyage . But what use to an Ittatikan were Ensiktan murder mysteriesand Bontuan pornography ? And so Grumdel Castle creaked and groaned the long dark way to the Solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Pazilliwheep checked for indications of excessive radioactivity , smog , and other hazards of an early-mechanical culture . Meanwhile Urgo the Red went outside to install camouflage tubes on the hull . His shipmates saw his fur as bright blue ; but then , they did n't use a visual spectrum identical with the Bontuan . The engineersupercargowas a tailless biped , three meters tall and broad to match . His head was round , short-muzzled , big-eyed , fuzzy , and rather endearing . His hands were five-fingered , his feet four-toed . In spite of his hirsute skin , he affected white coveralls , sandals , and an ornate tool belt . He clumped in again and shed his spacesuit . " Guess they 'll hang together awhile , " he reported , " but if the owners do n't spring for a new set when we get home , I 'm gon na look for another berth . How 's the planet doin ' ? " " About as before . I note more air traffic each time , though , damn it , " Pazilliwheep said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manned orbital satellite . We 'll have to wait here till the stupid thing 's on the opposite side of the globe . " Klak't'klak inquired why they lingered . Urgo explained . Grumdel Castle used a camouflage standard on worlds of this atmospheric type , where it was desired to fly unbeknownst . The natives could not detect an operating hyperdrive ; if they had that capability , they 'd soon be making their own star ships ! And antiradiation screens served to controlair molecules as well as atomic particles , making even the fastest travel soundless . But you were still stuck with the fact that your ship was a solid , visible , radar-reflecting object . So you wrapped her in the gaudiest ionized gas-discharge effect you could generate . You added powerful magnetic and electrostatic fields , and varied them randomly . You sailed in , alerting every eye and every instrument for a hundred miles aroundJust like a natural traveling plasmoid . But since those erratic masses of molecules and electrons occurin atmosphere , and the ship was in space , she must first sneak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spied a native aircraft . At Klak't'klak 's request , she veered close so he could get a goodp43look . Then she headed off for the home of that 143an people who , during the past two hundred years , had been members in good standingof the Galactic Federation . On the assumption that the flying saucer would continue in a straight line , Sean Lindquist zigzagged along the same general path . After half an hour he was rewarded . He crossed above an immense red ridge . Its farther slope tumbled into a canyon whose bottom was the most vivid green he 'd spied in a long while . Squarish adobe buildings were stacked against one rock wall , overlooking a stream lined with trees . But what made his pulses jump afresh was the objectthat lay before the houses . The dazzling , confusing play of colors was gone ; the shape had definite outlines and a dark gray hue ; but it was surely the thing that had buzzed him . And by all the saints and any heathen gods who cared to join in  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings , crammed on power , and whipped back the way he had come . A thermal nearly tossed him from control . But he must get out of sight before he was observed andAnd what ? Some kind of ray gun shot him down ? He ran his tongue across lips gone sandpapery . The ship had to be from outer space : real outer space , the unimaginable abysses that held the stars . He 'd followed the progress of flybys and landings within the Solar System . Hence he knew that , while the saucerians might be little and emerald-colored , they were not from any neighborhood planet . He also knew enough aerodynamics to be sure no Terrestrial organizationwas experimenting with stuff that advanced . Even if he had been ignorant of the engineering requirements , he was learned in the ways of public relations offices . . . . " Stop maundering , will you ? " he croaked . What to do ? He kept the plane wobbling back and forth on the far side of the mountain while , feverishly , he studied his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . . . " Wuwucimti , " plus the symbol for Pop . 0-1000. . . evidently a pueblo , and lonely as hell , to judge from the fact that nothing led away from it except a dim mule trail . . . .

If he could raise , oh , Gallup or Durango or wherever . . . make his location known , so it would n't do the aliens any good top44destroy him . . . . A distant seething filled his earphones . Whether atmospherics or They were responsible , he could n't get through . He got his pipe off the floor , reloaded and relit it , and fumed himself into a measure of calm . A long gulp from a bottle that lived in his sleeping bag was equally helpful . Consider , Lindquist , he thought . You 've stumbled on a secret to shake the world . But this is hardly our first visit from yonder . Leaving aside the mistakes , the hoaxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always was a certain amount of saucer observation that could n't be explained away . At least , it was easier to believe in spaceships than in some of those concatenationsof coincidences that the orthodox scientists postulated ! And now you 've got proof that the ship hypothesis is right . Only , who 's going to take your unsupported word ? Supposing you could go fetch witnesses , the thing 's bound to be gone when you return . You 'd get classed with Adamski and his breed . For which same reason , you 'll keep your mouth shut . Hey ! he reflected in rising eagerness . How many people have actually met saucerians , and been disbelieved afterward ? And , on that account , how many more have met them and  --  not wanting to be laughed at  --  simply kept mum ? After all . . . what little consistent evidence there is  --  indicates the saucerians are n't evil . They 're shy , or snobbish , or something , but 1 ca n't remember anyone ever claiming that they do any deliberate harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no second thoughts , Lindquist brought the plane about . He roared back over the mountain , chose his position , tilted wings , and commenced vertical descent . Updrafts were tricky ; and this was a somewhat battered , cranky craft he had . For a while he was too occupied with controls , instruments , hiss and shudder around him , to heed much else . He did see how the saucer squatted imperturbable in the bright late sunlight . Tawny mud-brick walls , red canyon sides , deep blue sky , green meadows and cornfields , green cottonwoods and willows along the quicksilver stream , dusty sage and juniper farther back  --  and in the middle , a spaceship from the stars ! His landing gear touched . He cut the power . Silence hit him like a thunderclap . He unharnessed , opened the door , and sprang shakily forth . The air was thin , dry , pungent with resinous odors . Except forp45a breeze , tinkle of water , bleating from a pasture shared by sheep and goats , the silence continued . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types , a few hundred medium-sized dark-complexioned folk of every apparent age . Men and women both wore their hair in braids . Clothing varied , from more or less traditional breechcloths , gowns , and blankets , to levis and sport shirts . Lindquist 's sharpened perceptions noted that the people were better clad , seemed more healthy and prosperous , than the average Southwest Indian . And they were strangely uncordial . Not that they threatened him . But they drew up in a kind of phalanx , and stared , and said never a word . Even the littlest children sucked their thumbs in a marked manner . Lindquist gulped . " Uh . . . hello , " he said . His voice sounded very small to him . " I 'm afraid I , uh , do n't speak your language . " They might know Spanish . " Buenas dias , mis amigos . " Trouble was , that damn near exhausted his Spanish . A grizzled , weather-beaten man called softly , " Sikyabotoma . " Lindquist said , " I beg your pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man who stepped to the elder . They put heads together and conferred in mutters . Lindquist gulped again , nodded , pasted on a smile , and started toward the flying saucer . At once he grew so conscious of it  --  so astonished , for instance , at the pitted , corroded metal of what had once been a smooth unitized shape  --  that the Indians faded from his mind . Colliding with them was a shock . Several had moved to intercept him . They were embarrassed . The pueblo dwellers are among the politestbeings on Earth . They smiled , in a forced way , bobbed their heads , and waved their hands . They pushed gently on Lindquist 's arms , as if to urge him toward their houses . Anger flared . " No , thanks ! " he snapped , and planted his heels . The young man rescued the situation . He was among those who wore modern clothes , including the gaudiest sombrero Lindquist had ever met . He sauntered forth , tapped the newcomer on the back , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . " " What ? " Lindquist whirled to confront him . " Welcome to Wuwucimti Pueblo , " the Indian said . " I 'm Sikyabotoma . But in the Army I used the name Joe Andrews . Picked that because it 's handy being near the head of the alphabet . So if you want , call me Joe . Come on inside and have a drink . "  | " I  --  I thought  --  you  --  " " You need n't be surprised . Sure , the Hopi do n't approve of liquor as a rule . But they need somebody like me , who 's equipped to handle white men . Like , I interpret when we take the mules to town and stock up on things . And I did do a military hitch . So I 've gotten a few outsider habits . It 's good bourbon . " " But  --  I mean  --  " Lindquist twisted his neck to goggle at what now lay behind his back . " I never imagined  --  " " Yes , it is unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindquist , who must needs come along as he ambled in the direction of the village . " We 're the most isolated pueblo in the country . Not awful old . A bunch of Shoshonean-speaking Hopi moved here to get away from the Spaniards after the revolt of 1680 was put down . So we have a tradition of minding our own affairs , and we discouragevisitors . Nothing rude , you understand . We just do n't do anythinginteresting when the anthropologists come . And we got rid of the missionaries by telling the last padre who showed that we 'd alreadybeen converted to hard-shell Baptists . " The other Indians trailed after at some distance . They kept their silence . " Please do n't think we 're hostile , " Sikyabotoma urged . " We 're only satisfied . We combine the old and the new as suits us best ; and we do quite well for ourselves , on the whole ; and everybody among us knows it . Regular contact with the outside world would upset our applecart . So we act pretty unanimously to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture anyhow . If you 're in trouble , we 'll help you , Mr. , uh  --  " " Lindquist , " said Lindquist feebly . " We 'll do what we can for you . But if you dropped in out of curiosity , well , I hate to sound inhospitable , but the fact is you 'd find Wuwucimti a mighty dull place . Lively young fellow like you , huh ? I 'd suggest you proceed right away . And , uh , I 'd take it as a favor if you do n't mention this stop you made . We 're not after tourist businessand that 's that . You savvy ? " " Dull ? " Lindquist tore loose . He spun , flung out both arms toward the great spaceship , and shouted , " You call that dull ? " so echoes rang . " Well , not to me , of course , " Sikyabotoma said . " I get my kicks . And the average pueblo dweller is staid by nature . " " Flying saucers and  --  and  --  "  |p47Sikyabotoma  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " Sure I feel okay ! What about that flying saucer over there ? " Sikyabotoma squinted . " What flying saucer ? " " What do you mean ? I , I , I chased it . . . to here . . . and there it sits ! " " Awa-Tsireh , " called Sikyabotoma , " do you see a flying saucer ? " A middle-aged Indian looked solemnly back and shook his head . " No , " he grunted . " No see fly sawsuh . " " I 'll ask the others in Hopi if you want , " Sikyabotoma offered . " But you know , Mr. Lindquist , when people are n't used to this thin air and sun-glare , they can mistake mirage effects for some of the damnedest things . I 'd be careful about that if I were you . Flitting around in an airplane , a guy has to be mighty sure what 's real and what 's an optical illusion . Does n't he ? " Lindquist stared for an entire minute into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also begun to smile and murmur soothing words . Briefly , in his tottering mind , he wondered if he was not indeed the crazy one . No ! He sprang back and launched himself . His legs flew . Dust spurted , the footfalls slammed through his shins , and he made an end run around the tribe . Meanwhile he bawled : " Do radars have illusions ? Do compasses ? By heaven . . . let me . . . at my instruments . . . and I 'll show you ! " He reached the ship . Its curve swelled immense above him , castinga knife-edged shadow . He snatched a rock and pounded the metal . It boomed . A lizard ran away . The sandstone crumbled under repeatedimpacts . " Is that optical ? " he screamed . The Hopi had been running toward him . But once more they halted at a distance . Sikyabotoma came nearer . The young Indian stopped , regarded Lindquist , and sighed . " Okay , " he said . " I did n't really expect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He semaphored with his arms . Lindquist stepped back from the ship , panting , sweating , trembling . The canyon brooded in a quiet immense and eternal ; only the wind had voice . Then came a rusty creak . Someone had been watching from inside , through some kind of television . And in some fashion , a part of the hull detached itself onp48three sides and unrolled , to make a gangway to the ground . Three creatures came forth . Lindquist saw them and strangled on an oath that was half a prayer . Sikyabotoma took a philosophical attitude . " You ought to see what membership in the Galactic Federation has done to our kachina dolls , " he remarked . " The real ones , that we do n't show the anthro-pologists . " " This is most annoying , " Klak't'klak said . He flapped his wings . They made a parchment rustle where he squatted in the sunshine , under the spaceship , confronting the bug-eyed 143an . " Sure is , " Urgo the Red agreed . " We got ta get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay away from here for several days  --  prob'ly go into orbit  --  in case he does somehow talk somebody into comin ' back with him . Right when I was hopin ' to get that Number Three regulator tuned ! " " I was thinking more personally , " the Inspector admitted . " I am not prepared to conduct interviews . That is , my translating computer has not yet assimilated the records of this planet 's dominant languageswhich the autochthons brought me from their  --  ah  --  what did they call it ?  --  their kiva . And I hate working through interpreters . " " So do n't . " " No , as long as we have captured this being , I feel my duty is to examine him for whatever information he can give . And , too , I should endeavor to allay his fears . To this poor unsophisticated semisavage , we must resemble veritable demons . Consider how he staggeredto his aircraft for that bottle of tranquilizing medication he now clutches so tightly . " Urgo waved a massive blue hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Indians . " I do n't speak this barbarian 's jabber , " the navigator-pilot explained , " but Sikyabotoma does . " Urgo passed on the datum . The galactics , including the Pueblo man , formed a semicircle confronting Lindquist . The rest of the village watched aloofly . Klak't'klak lifted a gaunt arm . " Greeting to you , 0 native , " he said in Interlingo-12 . " Rest assured that you are in the grasping organs of civilized and benevolent entities who intend you no harm : who may , indeed , prove to be the promoters of a benign revolution upon your planet . Whether this eventuality materializes or not is dependent uponp49my official judgment as to whether a general announcement of the existence of a galaxy-wide Federation of technologically and sociologicallyadvanced races will serve the larger good , including your own good . Hence the outcome is to a small extent dependent upon what you yourself , individually , today , choose to give me in the way of information . May I therefore initially request  --  request , mind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you relate to me in circumstantial detail what I wish to be apprised of , beginning with the events which led to your untoward arrival . " " He wants to know how the bum got here , " Urgo said in Interlingo-7 . " The honorable envoy of the Federation 's guiding council asks what gods led hither the stranger 's path , " Pazilliwheep said in Hopi . " The pterodactyl character is a kind of inspector , " Sikyabotoma said in English . " He wo n't hurt you , but he would like to know a few things , like how come you stopped by . " Lindquist took another pull on his bottle . " I . . . I saw the flyingsaucer . . . and followed it , " he whispered . " Yeah , sure . Look , pal , I do n't believe you can tell him a thing that I ca n't . But let 's go through with the game and make him happy , okay ? The other two are plain merchant sailors . Old buddies of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to help establish an outplanet market for our local handicrafts . But Beak-and-Wings , he 's come to find out whether the galactics ought to let the rest of Earth know about them ; whether they should invite every country to join their Federation . In other words , he 's one of those do-gooder types . " " You  --  do n't think  --  we should join ? " Lindquist got forth . " Frankly , no . " Sikyabotoma shrugged . " Not that this pueblo is selfish , or holds a deep grudge against the white man , or anything . However , you ca n't expect we 'll fall over ourselves to do the white man a favor , can you ? Especially when that 'd end our own comfortablemonopoly on trade and services with the galaxy . We 're not ostentatiousabout it , and of course we 're pretty small potatoes in the Federation . . . but you 'd be surprised at some of the stuff we keep in our adobes . " Lindquist braced himself . " I look at the matter differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give him my side of the story ? " " Sure . I may be prejudiced , but I 'm honest . Besides , he figuresp50to study the whole planet . Do n't loft your hopes , though . One dollar gets you ten that he turns thumbs down . " " How can he ? " Lindquist cried . Sikyabotoma looked closer . " I 'll be damned , you 're right . He has thumbs on both sides of his palms . . . . Oh . You mean how can he refuse the USA , and the USSR , and France , and Britain , and China , and  --  Well , it 's easy . They have n't anything unique to offer . Not in a galaxy loaded with civilizations . All that Wuwucimti has , really , is a convenient location , and people who do n't swarm over every ship that lands , stealing things and asking stupid questions . You start lettingin the riffraff , and first you 've got to disestablish institutions like war , and then you 've got to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a mess . That 's why secrecy is preserved , you know . If you guys ever found out the truth , collectively , you 'd have to be invited to join . Otherwise , the do-gooders say , your precious little egos would be so bruised that what culture you have would fall to pieces . " The Hopi checked himself . " Sorry . I did n't mean to sound smug . Or malicious . It 's just the way the ball bounces . " " How about my ego ? " Lindquist demanded , close to tears . Sikyabotoma patted his shoulder . " Nothing personal , Charlie , " he said . " Individual humans who got interviewed in the past do n't seem to 've suffered harm . Look at it this way : You wo n't be any worse off than you were . Huh ? " " I 'll tell the world ! " Lindquist said furiously . " I 'll call in the FBI , the news reporters , the  --  " " For both our sakes , " the Indian answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a fool of yourself . At most , you 'd bring in somebody else , and the village ' ud have to go through the same old cover-up schtick as before . You would n't do that to us , would you , now ? A nice guy like you ? " " No , I 'll keep watch  --  " Lindquist snapped his mouth shut . " Till another ship arrives , eh ? " Sikyabotoma chuckled . " You 'd wait a mighty long time , podner . " " Not many come ? " " M-m-m , well , it varies . With thousands of shipping outfits plyingthese lanes , we can expect several craft per year to stop by , though we never know in advance . However , what we do know is if anybody'swithin thirty  --  forty kilometers . A little gadget that detectsthoughts . So you ca n't monitor us unbeknownst . We can warn offp51ships ; they do radio us from orbit before landing . Chances are they 'd come down anyway , but maintain camouflage . All you 'd observe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If worst comes to worst , a bunch of us can deal with a spy . Nothing violent , understand . We 'll kind of escort him away , no more . If we have to break his camera , we 'll pay him full value . You see , we 're Federation members ; we live by Federation rules . " The Inspector spoke words which went along the chain of interpreters . Sikyabotoma nodded and sat down on his haunches . " You might as well relax , " he said . " Over here , in the shade . You 're about to be interviewed . " Time passed . Shadows lengthened . The Pueblo women cooked dinner . They brought some to Lindquist . It was Hopi food , based on cornmeal tortillas , but the filling was like nothing on Earth . Quite literally so . Sikyabotoma explained that a lot of interstellar trade was in spices . When the sun went below the mountains , stars leaped arrogantly forth . Coyotes yipped across a gigantic silence . Lindquist stared heavenwardand shivered in the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " he said . " They 'll fly you out now , to make sure you do n't hang around . Any special place you 'd like to go ? " " Colorado Springs ? " Lindquist faltered . " I would n't . NORAD headquarters , remember . They spot your plane on their radars without any flight plan filed , they might get a little unpleasant . " " That 's my problem . " Lindquist could scarcely keep his tone level . He had not dared hope his precarious scheme would work to this extent . " Okay , then . Hm , I think I 'll ride along . You might enjoy being shown around a genuine hypership . Something to tell your grandchildren , if you do n't mind ' em thinking you 're an awful liar . " The three aliens embarked . Lindquist and Sikyabotoma followed , after the village elders had bidden the former good-bye with every ritual courtesy . A larger opening gaped elsewhere in the hull ; the aircraft rose on some silent , invisible beam of force ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soundlessly , but swathed again in rainbow haze , she lifted and swung north.  |p52Inside  , she was less impressive . In fact , she was grimy , battered , noisy , and ill-smelling . Sikyabotoma shrugged when Lindquist dared remark on it . " What do you expect in an old tramp with cheapskate owners ? Red plush toilet seats ? C'm on , we better stash you in your plane . Be over Pike 's Peak soon . " When Lindquist was harnessed , the Hopi stuck a hand through the open cabin door of the aircraft . His brown face was bent in a wry smile . " Shake , " he offered . " I hope there are n't any hard feelings . You 're a right guy . I could damn near wish Birdbrain does certify this whole planet for membership . But I know he wo n't . So long , Charlie , and good luck to you . " He closed the door . For a minute Lindquist sat alone , in the thrumming , coldly lit cavern of the hold . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystalline black . Air puffed outward , popping his eardrums , and chill flowed inward . He started his engine . But it was the impalpable force beam that carried him forth and released him . Town lights glittered far beneath . The spaceship hovered close , like a swirling , shifting , many-hued light-fog . She departed , gathering speed until no human-built rocket could have paced her . Night swallowedthe vision . Lindquist shuddered . His radio receiver squawked with challenge . An interceptor jet winged toward him . " Sure , " he said . " I 'll come down . Anyplace you want . " Excitement torrented through him . " And then . . . take me to your leader ! " In the morning they turned him over to Lieutenant Harold Quimby . Maybe that press officer could get rid of him . Sunlight slanted through a window , beyond which stretched the neat buildings and walked the neat personnel of a United States Air Force base . Light glowed on immaculate office furniture , on Quimby 's polished insignia and practiced toothpaste smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and haggard he was . His eyes burned ; the lids felt like sandpaper . " Cigarette ? " Quimby invited . " Coffee ? " " No , " Lindquist grated . " Some common sense . That 's all I ask . The common sense and common decency of listening to me . " " Why , surely our people  --  "  | " Yeah , they grilled me . For most of the night . Oh , polite enough . But they kept after me and after me . " " Well , you must realize , Mr. Lindquist , when you suddenly appearover a sensitive area like this , you must expect that men charged with the national defense will ask for details . " " Damn it , I gave them details ! Every last stinking detail I could dredge up . Look , the fact that I did appear , without your fool radars registering me till I was there . . . does n't that mean anything ? " " It means that the plasmoid blanketed your approach . Not unknown . An unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward with a sympathetic air . " I can easily understand why you would follow such a beautiful and fascinating object . And , ah , how the interplayof colors . . . hypnotic , even epileptogenic effects . . . mistakinga vivid dream for reality  --  no , wait ! " He lifted his hand . " The Air Force is not calling you a lunatic , Mr. Lindquist . What happened to you could happen to anyone . I talked with Major Williams of our psychiatric division before my appointment with you today . He assuredme that illusion and confusion are the normal result of lengthy exposure to certain optical phenomena . We lodged you overnight preciselyin order that our intelligence officers could make a few phone calls , checking on your background and recent activities . I assure you , Mr. Lindquist , we are careful here . We have established that you are sane and well intentioned . We appreciate the patriotism that led you to seek us out , even in your , ah , slightly delirious condition . You are free to go home , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force . " Quimby paused for breath . " But you saw the spaceship yourselves ! " Lindquist groaned . " You radared the thing . You recorded electric and magnetic effects . Your technical man admitted as much to me . How can you call it an illusion ? " " We do n't , sir , we do n't , " Quimby beamed . " It was absolutely real . The Air Force is not dogmatic . The Air Force has been interested in this subject for many years . When the first so-called flying saucer reports were made in the later 1940s , the Air Force mounted its own investigation . Here . " He handed Lindquist a glossy-paper pamphlet off a stack on his desk . " A brief summary of Project Blue Book . Certain people continued unsatisfied . They charged  --  quite wrongly , I assure you  --  they charged distortion and suppression of evidence . Accordingly , to clear its good name , in the late 1960s thep54Air Force supported a new , independent investigation under the leadershipof the late distinguished Dr. Condon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindquist another pamphlet . " Here is a history of that effort . " And another . " Here is information on the final effort , which produced a theory to account for the facts . This is a summary of the technical findings . Here is a somewhat more popular account , and here is a reprint of what proved to be the key physical data , and here is a  --  " Lindquist slumped . " I know , " he said . " They told me last night what they believe . Ball lightning . " " Well , no , not exactly that , " Lindquist said . " The subject is pretty complicated . Yes , sir , pretty complicated , if I do say so myself . Flying saucer reports had many different sources . Early during the furore , it was shown that most were caused by sightings of weather balloons , or mirages , or reflections , or Venus , or any of several other things . There did remain a certain small percentage which could not be accounted for in that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate plasmoids in the atmosphere . You know , traveling masses of ionized gas , held together for a few minutes or hours by a kind of self-generated magnetic bottle . Ball lightning is one kind of plasmoid . There are others . Including the kind that shines , produceserratic magnetic and electric fields , reflects radar , shuttles about at incredible speed but with never a sound , and is roughly diskshaped . In short , the classical flying saucer apparition . This was proven , Mr. Lindquist . It was observed , analyzed , and reproduced in the laboratory . By now , any good electrophysicist who wanted to take the trouble could fake his own flying saucer . Here is an account by the Nobel Prize winner Dr.  --  " " Never mind , " Lindquist mumbled . " I do n't doubt there are natural neon signs zipping around . So the saucerians do n't need anything for camouflage except a false one . " " Well , Mr. Lindquist , " Quimby replied , the least bit severely , " do n't you believe it 's high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are ? You had a , ah , an involuntary psychedelic experience . You would not have had it if you had known the truth . Then you would have realized there was no point in chasing that plasmoid . Nobody does anymore , you know . Because of your , ah , long foreign residence , you were n't kept up to date . But the truth is that the flying saucer hysteria vanished years ago . Once the clearp55light of science was thrown on this murky subject , the American peoplerealized that everything had been due to an easily explainable naturalphenomenon . They turned their attention to better topics . You wo n't find anyone any longer who claims that flying saucers are , ah , spaceships crewed by little green men . " " Would you believe a surly blue giant ? " " No , Mr. Lindquist , I would not . Nor , ah , pterodactyls and centaurswith arms on their noses . Least of all that a bunch of povertystricken , mostly illiterate Pueblo Indians are  --  Well , you have a very imaginative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one cares to listen . So you had better settle for everyday reality . " Lindquist raised eyes in which hope still struggled with exhaustion . " No one ? " he asked . " Absolutely no one in the world ? " " Oh , I suppose a few cranks are left , like in California , " Quimby laughed . " People to whom the outer-space-visitors idea became a sort of religion that they still ca n't bear to give up . " His tone sharpened . " It would not be advisable to prey on their gullibility . Not that you would , Mr. Lindquist . But some confidence man who , ah , tried to squeeze a dollar from those poor deluded souls  --  yes , I think the authoritiesmight deal rather harshly with him . " Lindquist rose . " I know when I 'm licked , " he said bitterly . " I wo n't take any more of your time . " " Well , thank you , that 's appreciated . " Quimby stood too , with almost indecent haste . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about General Robinson 's promotion to four-star rank . " Lindquist ignored the proffered hand and shambled toward the door . " Too busy to bring Earth into the Galactic Federation ! " he spat . " That 's not the job of the Air Force , " Quimby reminded him . " Foreign relations belong to the State Department . " The bar which Lindquist found was noisy with college students . He did n't mind that . For the most part he sat hunched over his beer . When his awareness did , occasionally , return from interstellar immensities  --  toorder more beer  --  he got a little encouragement from the sight of coeds passing by . A universe which had produced girls could n't be all bad . Contrariwise , it must be a hell of a good universe . Rich , won/derful , various , exciting , mind-expanding , soul-uplifting : if only you could get out into the damned thing . " Rats ! " Lindquist muttered around his pipestem . " Got to be some way to make a buck with what I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought . They denied to the human race every marvel , opportunity , insight , help , comfort that a millennia-old science must have to give . Not that they were monsters . With  --  how many suns in the galaxy ? a hundred billion ?  --  theyrated intelligent species at a dime a dozen , and probably this was inevitable . Indeed , it was astonishing how altruistic they were . They could have conquered Earth in an afternoon . But instead , they slunk about in disguise for fear of what the knowledge of their presence might do to men . . . if , following the revelation , they did not promptly act to lift man to their own level . Sure , you ca n't blame them . Why should they solve our problemsfor us ? Especially when it 'd be a lot of trouble and expense to them . What did we ever do for the galactics ? Lindquist fumed smoke into the racketing , beer-laden air . That 's not the point , he thought grimly . The point as far as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species will keep on being poor , ignorant , war-plagued , tyrannized , restricted , short-lived , and I do n't know what else  --  unless the Federation can be forced to take us in . Which it can be , if we the people of the United States learn for sure that the Federation exists . How ? The galactics , including those damn Injuns , understand how to keep us blindfolded . They did n't even bother to silence me . Who 'd listen ? Maybe , momentarily , the chance had existed . In 1950 , or wheneverthe flying saucer craze started , human civilization had advanced to the point where it could imagine extraterrestrial visitors ; and it had not yet gotten the idea of plasmoids , or rather , it was denying that any such thing could be . So the standard spaceship disguise had been ineffective for a decade or two . Unfortunately , though , no one had happened to catch a sitting spaceship during those years . At least , not enough people had happened to do so , and their unsupported word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be plasmoids . Therefore , humankind concluded , they were plasmoids . As the galactics had foreseen . The bastards . Today no one would believe the crazy truth . Except maybe somep57pathetic remnants of the discredited saucer cults . They might . But what could they do , except invite the narrator into their mutual admirationsociety ? What . . . could . . . they . . . do ? Sean Lindquist leaped to his feet . His table went over , scattering beer and broken glass . His pipe fell to the floor . " Eureka ! " he bellowed . The bartender approached . " You had enough , buster , " he said ominously . " Start taking off your clothes and I call a cop . " The Reverend Jacob Muir , pastor of the First United Church of the Cosmic Brotherhood , was a surprise . Though Lindquist had done considerable research beforehand , he had expected someone more , well , far out . Reverend Muir was soft-spoken , self-contained , and conventionally dressed : for Los Angeles , at least . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that earned him his daily bread . The place could have belonged to any middle-class , middleagedcouple . Only the books were unusual . They formed probably as complete a library of sauceriana as existed anywhere on Earth . " Please sit down , Mr. Lindquist , " he invited . " Would you care for some coffee ?  --  Joan , brew us a pot , will you , dear ?  --  Smoke if you wish . It 's bad for the health , but until the Elder Brethren see fit to raise us to the next rung of evolution 's ladder , we ca n't much help our frailties . Pardon me . I did n't intend to preach at you . You came to tell me something , not vice versa . " Lindquist wondered what his best gambit was . From what he could learn of the C. B. Church , its few score active members , and its influence on several hundred saucerists of other kinds , he did n't believe that he could be entirely truthful . Muir 's credo held that the extraterrestrials were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the chosen instrument of God . That would n't fit well with a rusty old tramp ship , pinchpenny owners , and so forth . Would it ? " I 've had an Experience , " he said . " Really ? " Muir 's tone did not alter . " Do you know , I never have been vouchsafed one . Few who were are left alive ; and the last confirmedreport of a talk with Them was fifteen years ago . " His gaze was quite steady . Traffic noises came through the window , to underscorehis voice with muted thunder . " Hoaxes are not unheard-of . "  |p58Lindquist  achieved a smile . " You 're skeptical , Reverend ? " " Well , let us say I 'm open-minded . I 've often stated , in sermons and articles , that I think the Elders have abandoned us for a while because we grew too skeptical . They will come back when faith has come back . But  --  forgive me  --  there have been deliberate frauds , and there have been far more honest mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must sift your story carefully  --  whatever you tell . " " You 're very tactful , sir . " Lindquist 's lanky frame relaxed in the armchair . As he felt his way into the situation , he gained confidence . " And I might as well confess at the outset , I want money . Furthermore , I have n't a scrap of physical evidence . Only the recent sighting over Colorado Springs , which thousands of people saw . " He drew a breath . " However , if I can get financing , your auditors will keep track of every nickel . What we need is to build and transport a certaindevice which the Elders have described to me . For this , we 'll have to buy materials and hire expensive technicians . We 'll have to do a little R &; D , perhaps , because the Elders did n't give me any blueprint , only a general verbal account . We 'll have to do this on the QT until we 're ready to roll , or you can imagine what a field day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . Lindquist hurried on : " In earnest of my sincerity , as well as to help , I can mortgage what little I own and toss several thousand dollars into the kitty . If you can double that , I believe we 'll have the necessary . I checked on your people before I phoned you . They 're not rich by a long shot . But between your congregation and , uh , its sympathizers  --  if you launch an appeal yourself  --  a few dollars contributed per person  --  the thing can be swung financially without hurting any individual except me if it fails . " He paused . " I do not guarantee success , " he finished . Muir sat quiet for a long time . His eyes never left his visitor . Finally he whispered , " You 're not a con artist . You may be a crank , but you 're honest . Go on , in God 's name . " Lindquist saw tears . However noble his purpose , he felt a touch guilty as he gave his doctored account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dire straits . Disaster was imminent . Yet they could not destroy the human spirit by acting as dictators . They could only work through such persons as had faith in them . Nor could they linger here . Other planets also needed their attention . But if enough humans had faith  --  if the veritable mustard seedp59existed upon Earth  --  then they could manifest themselves at last , and lead mankind to salvation . To this end , let the faithful build a communicationdevice such as they demonstrated and explained to Sean F. X. Lindquist . In time , they would receive its message and they would come . Did no such call reach them , they would sadly know that man was beyond redemption . Passing through the ship 's observation veranda  --  an elegant phrase for a crummy little cabin outfitted with an exterior visiscreen and a few seats adjustable to most species  --  Urgo the Red saw Klak't'klak . The Sector Inspector stood hunched before the view that slid beneath . The scene was of high desert , raw mineral hues under a blazing sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet he looked so frail , bowed , utterly tired and discouraged , that Urgo 's equivalent of a heart went out to him . The engineersupercargohad grumbled at length during the past tedious weeks . Nevertheless , against his will , he had come to like the official passenger . It hurt him , now , to see the little Ittatikan stand thus alone . He went and joined him . " You 're really quittin ' , huh ? " he asked inanely . Klak't'klak uttered a mournful whistle . " Yes . Not that the nativeshave no potential . They seem about average , insofar as any such concept is meaningful . But I could not justify a recommendation that missions be sent to elevate them . " " Troublemakers . Yeh , I could'a told you that right off , " Urgo rumbled . " No . Not really . " Klak't'klak spread his wings and folded them again . " They would not be a detriment to the Federation . But neither would they be an outstanding asset , as far as I can judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , be . . . merely one more member species . Therefore , as long as they remain in happy ignoranceof us , I can not honestly say that the Federation taxpayer should be burdened with the cost of incorporating them . Let them invent the hyperdrive for themselves , in a thousand or two years . " Urgo belched , which out of him corresponded to a sigh of relief . " That 's the spirit , Inspector ! I knew you 'd decide right . But how come are you lookin ' down in the chops you have n't got ? " " I do n't rightly know , " Klak't'klak said . " Depression , I suppose . So much time , effort , expense , inconveniencing you and Navigator/Pilot Finnison  --  you 've been extraordinarily kind , you two , and I wo n't forget it when I write my official report  --  but for nothing . " Urgo waved his mighty arms . " Ah , do n't worry . The job was a drag , sure , but it 's over with now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rest and some trade goods . Then ho for the Rim ! " At that moment , the buzzer sounded . Pazilliwheep 's voice followed . " Attenta ! " He had amused himself by acquiring a few 143an phrases as Grumdel Castle prowled around the globe . " Pericolo ! All hands to stations ! " " What the blazes ? " Urgo was already loping for the engine room . Klak't'klak flapped and hopped toward his quarters , where he would at least be out of the way . You do n't argue when someone calls emergency on a hypership . The deck gouged to the **29;2090;TOOLONG . " What's'a matter ? " he roared . " I do n't know , " Pazilliwheep said tautly over the intercom . " Electromagnetic field . . . variable . . . registered a few seconds ago . Might be a natural plasmoid , but we 'd better have a look . " Urgo felt relieved . The news could have been something nasty , like the bottom dropping out of this hull . " Where are we , anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of Wuwucimti . Which is to say , the emanations could be from a galactic ship in distress  --  a little ways beyond mind detector range from the pueblo . " Pazilliwheep swung his craft through a ninety-degree turn . The acceleration compensatorswere so badly out of phase that Urgo slipped on the deck and hit his nose . Nevertheless , the engineer-supercargo confined his remarks to a muttered " Snagabagabartbats ! " That was cruel country below , especially for beings who had not evolved on this planet . A vessel grounded helpless in those arid mountains and canyons might soon be crewless . And that  --  aside from every moral consideration  --  invited the disaster of discovery by non-Hopi autochthons . It was well that Grumdel Castle had happened by in time . Once in the engine room , Urgo activated his own visiscreen . He saw a wild landscape , heat shimmers and dust devils . . . and , yes , a saucer shape on a small mesa . Its outlines were blurred by a weak camouflage field , and neither he nor Pazilliwheep could identify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   | " Why are n't they transmitting ? " Pazilliwheep wondered . " Transmitter busted , I guess , " Urgo said . " They could'a lain here for , cometfire , days or weeks , you know . Aimin ' to land at Wuwucimti but not makin ' it . Expectin ' somebody else 'd come by eventually , and keepin ' their field goin ' so 's they 'd be detectable at a distance . " " But not daring to strike out on foot for the pueblo , " Pazilliwheepadded . " Right you are . Let 's get down . " Grumdel Castle descended to the mesa and cut her own camouflageand her engines . The gain-tics emerged into brilliant , silent , sagebrush-pungent air . Hulking Urgo , graceful Pazilliwheep , broadwingedKlak't'klak moved across the sand toward the beached hypership . Only , now that they were close , it looked less and less like a hypership . It looked more and more like " Surprise , surprise ! " caroled a native voice . Sean F. X. Lindquist'slean form sprang from the false hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome , face wide open in a silly grin . " Am I glad to see you ! Two weeks waiting ! And you turn out to be the very same guys who  --  Come on and have a cold beer ! " Klak't'klak had brought his translator machine , which was keyed to several federation as well as 143an languages . But it was his pomander behind which he retreated . His eyes rolled . He gasped . Urgo bawled , " Oh , no ! " and Pazilliwheep looked ill . Other humans emerged . So did a television camera on a dolly . " We alerted the news services , " Lindquist said happily . " Of course they thought this was a lunatic-fringe project , but they did agree to stand by , in case we came up with anything good for laughs . Smile , you 're on candid camera ! Now we better break the news gently to my assistants , that you are n't quite the godlike beings most of them think you are . " He stopped , blushed through his stubble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so excited I forgot . Here 's Professor Rostovtsev from Colorado U. He speaks Hopi . " Klak't'klak had already adjusted his machine to English . He turned it off for a minute , while he expressed himself in his own tongue . Then he closed the circuit again . " Never mind , " he said resignedly . " Welcome to the Galactic Federation . "  |p62So  far the book has been straightforward , mostly optimistic science fiction storytelling , Now it 's time to move on . There are other themes , other treatments and emphases , possible even within the strictest definition of the field . My wife Karen gave me so much help in thinking this one out that I in turn gave her half the by-line on original publication , and want the same understood here . THIS IS A LIE , but I wish so much it were not . Pain struck through like lightning .

It filled the jagged darkness , it drowned all else , until it began to die out , or to vanish into the endless , century after century , and meanwhile the night deepened and softened , until he had peace . But he opened himself again and was in a place long and high . With his not-eyes he saw that five hundred and forty doors gave onto black immensities wherein dwelt clouds of light . Some of the clouds were bringing suns to birth . Others , greater and more distant , were made of suns already created , and turned in majestic Catherine'sp63wheels . The nearest stars cast out streamers of flame , lances of radiance ; and they were diamond , amethyst , emerald , topaz , ruby ; and around them swung glints which he knew with his not-brain were planets .

Eternity , yes , but not time . " Best we move on , " he suggested . " Uh-huh , " Roger said . " Especially after Murphy took this much trouble on our account . " " He does not appear to be a bad fellow , " Vladimir said . " I am not certain , " Robert answered . " Nor am I certain that we ever will find out . But come , friends . The hour is near .

But he recalled that , while the universe was inexhaustibleof wonders , it would have only the single moment to which he was being guided . They stood after a while on a great ashen plain . The outlook was as eerily beautiful as he had hoped  --  no , more , when Earth , a blue serenity swirled white with weather , shone overhead : Earth , whence had come the shape that now climbed down a ladder of fire . Yuri took Konstantin by the hand in the Russian way . " Thank you , " he said through tears . But Konstantin bowed in turn , very deeply , to Willy . And they stood in the long Lunar shadows , under the high Lunar heaven , and saw the awkward thing come to rest and heard : " Houston , Tranquillity Base here . The Eagle has landed .

Earth and its people were just lost , just a speck of nothing among those cold sharp stars . Dad said they were n't too different from what you saw in space , except for being a lot fewer . The air was chilly too , and had a kind of pureness , and a sweet smell from the pines around . Way off I heard a coyote yip . The sound had plenty of room to travel in . But I 'm back where people live . The smog 's not bad on this rooftop lookout , though I wish I did n't have to breathe what 's gone through a couple million pairs of lungs before it reaches me .

Murphy 's Law : " Anything that can go wrong , will . " Only I think it 's a true joke . I mean , I 've read every book and watched every tape I could lay hands on , the history , how the discovererswent out , farther and farther , lifetime after lifetime . I used to tell myself stories about the parts that nobody lived to put into a book . The crater wall had fangs . They stood sharp and grayish white in the cruel sunlight , against the shadpw which brimmed the bowl . And they grew and grew . Tumbling while it fell , the spacecraft had none of the restfulness of zero weight . Forces caught nauseatingly at gullet and gut . An unidentified loose object clattered behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two men breathed stench . No matter . This was n't an Apollo 13 mishap . They would n't have time to smother in their own exhalations . Jack Bredon croaked into the transmitter : " Hello , Mission Control . . . Lunar Relay Satellite . . . anybody . Do you read us ? Is the radio out too ? Or just our receiver ? God damn it , ca n't we even say good-bye to our wives ? " " Tell ' em quick , " Sam Washburn ordered . " Maybe they 'll hear . " Jack dabbed futilely at the sweat that broke from his face anddanced in glittering droplets before him . " Listen , " he said . " This isp65Moseley Expedition One . Our motors stopped functioning simultaneously , about two minutes after we commenced deceleration . The trouble must be in the fuel feed integrator .

Tell our wives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth of the crater filled the entire forward window . Sam 's teeth filled his countenance , a stretched-out grin . " How do you like that ? " he said . " And me the first black astronaut . " They struck . When they opened themselves again , in the hall , and knew where they were , he said , " Wonder if he 'll let us go out exploring . " Murphy 's Halt ? Is that the real name ? Dad used to shout , " Murphy take it ! " when he blew his temper . The rest is in a few of the old tapes , fiction plays about spacemen , back when people liked to watch that kind of story . They 'd say when a man had died , " He 's drinking in Murphy 's Hall . " Or he 's dancing or sleeping or frying or freezing or whatever it was . But did they really say " Hall " ? The tapes are old . Nobody 's been interested to copy them off on fresh plastic , not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The holographs are blurred and streaky , the sounds are mushed and full of random buzzes . Murphy 's Law has sure been working on those tapes . I wish I 'd asked Dad what the astronauts said and believed , way back when they were conquering the planets . Or pretended to believe , I should say . Of course they never thought there was a Murphywho kept a place where the spacefolk went that he 'd called to him . But they might have kidded around about it . Only was the idea , for sure , about a hall ? Or was that only the way I heard ? I wish I 'd asked Dad . But he was n't home often , these last years , what with helping build and test his ship . And when he did come , I could see how he mainly wanted to be with Mother . And when he and I were together , well , that was always too exciting for me to remember those yarns I 'd tell myself before I slept , after he was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silverman had finished writing his report , the temperature in the dome was about seventy , and rising fast enough that it should reach a hundred inside another Earth day .

But the staff would no longer be able to cool some down to drinking temperature by the crude evaporation apparatus they had rigged . They 'd dehydrate fast . Moshe sat naked in a running river of sweat . At least he had electric light . The fuel cells , insufficient to operatethe air conditioning system , would at least keep Sofia from dying in the dark . His head ached and his ears buzzed . Occasional dizziness seized him . He gagged on the warm fluid he must continually drink . And no more salt , he thought . Maybe that will kill us before the heat does , the simmering , still , stifling heat . His hones felt heavy , though Venus has in fact a somewhat lesser pull than Earth ; his muscles sagged and he smelled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he checked what he had written , a dry factual account of the breakdown of the reactor . The next expeditionwould read what this thick , poisonous inferno of an atmospheredid to graphite in combination with free neutrons ; and the engineers could work out proper precautions . In sudden fury , Moshe seized his brush and scrawled at the bottom of the metal sheet : " Do n't give up ! Do n't let this hellhole whip you ! We have too much to learn here . " A touch on his shoulder brought him jerkily around and onto his feet . Sofia Chiappellone had entered the office . Even now , with physical desire roasted out of him and she wetly agleam , puffy-faced , sunken-eyed , hair plastered lank to drooping head , he found her lovely . " Are n't you through , darling ?

Our souls will , waiting for the ships that never come . " She actually shivered , and urged him toward their comrades.  |p67Maybe  I should go back inside . Mother might need me . She cries a lot , still . Crying , all alone in our little apartment . But maybe she 'd rather not have me around . What can a gawky , pimply-faced fourteen-year-old boy do ? What can he do when he grows up ? 0 Dad , big brave Dad , I want to follow you . Even to Murphy 's ... Hold ? Director Saburo Murakami had stood behind the table in the commons and met their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pressed inward . The bright colors and amateurish figures in the mural that Georgios Efthimakis had painted for pleasure  --  beings that never were , nymphs and fauns and centaurs frolicking beneath an unsmoky sky , beside a bright river , among grasses and laurel trees and daisies of an Earth that no longer was  --  became suddenly grotesque , infinitelyalien . He heard his heart knocking . Twice he must swallow before he had enough moisture in his mouth to move his wooden tongue . But when he began his speech , the words came forth steadily , if a trifle flat and cold . That was no surprise . He had lain awake the whole night rehearsing them . " Yousouf Yacoub reports that he has definitely succeeded in checking the pseudovirus . This is not a cure ; such must await laboratoryresearch . Our algae will remain scant and sickly until the next supply ship brings us a new stock . I will radio Cosmocontrol , explainingthe need . They will have ample time on Earth to prepare . You remember the ship is scheduled to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in about nine months . Meanwhile we are guaranteed a rate of oxygen renewal sufficient to keep us alive , though weak , if we do not exert ourselves . Have I stated the matter correctly , Yousouf ? " The Arab nodded . His own Spanish had taken on a denser accent , and a tic played puppet master with his right eye . " Will you not request a special ship ? " he demanded . " No , " Saburo told them . " You are aware how expensive anything but an optimum Hohmann orbit is . That alone would wipe out the profit from this station  --  permanently , I fear , because of financing costs . Likewise would our idleness for nine months . " He leaned forward , supporting his weight easily on fingertips in the low Martian gravity . " That is what I wish to discuss today , " he said . " Interest rates represent competition for money . Moneyp68represents human labor and natural resources . This is true regardless of socioeconomic arrangements . You know how desperately short they are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions of hands  --  but because of massive poverty , too few educated brains . Think back to what a political struggle the Foundation had before this base could be established . " We know what we are here for . To explore . To learn . To make man 's first permanent home outside Earth and Luna . In the end , in the persons of our great-grandchildren , to give Mars air men can breathe , water they can drink , green fields and forests where their souls will have room to grow . " He gestured at the mural , though it seemed more than ever jeering . " We can not expect starvelings on Earth , or those who speak for them , to believe this is good . Not when each ship bears away metal and fuel and engineering skill that might have gone to keep their children alive a while longer . We justify our continued presence here solely by mining the fissionables . The energythis gives back to the tottering economy , over and above what we take out , is the profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anoxia made his head whirl . Somehow he stayed erect and continued : " I believe we , in this tiny solitary settlement , are the last hope for man remaining in space . If we are maintained until we have becomefully self-supporting , Syrtis Harbor will be the seedbed of the future . If not  --  " He had planned more of an exhortation before reaching the climax , but his lungs were too starved , his pulse too fluttery . He gripped the table edge and said through flying rags of darkness : " There will be oxygen for half of us to keep on after a fashion . By suspending their other projects and working exclusively in the mines , they can produce enough uranium and thorium that the books at least show no net economic loss . The sacrifice will . . . will be . . . of propaganda value . I call for male volunteers , or we can cast lots , or  --  Naturally , I myself am the first . "  --  That had been yesterday . Saburo was among those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't care for hymns about human solidarity ; his dream was that someday those who bore some of his and Alice 's chromosomes would not need solidarity . It was perhaps well she hadp69already died in a cinderslip . The scene with their children had been as much as he could endure . He crossed Weinbaum Ridge but stopped when the domeclusterwas out of sight . He must not make the searchers come too far . If nothing else , a quick dust storm might cover his tracks , and he might never be found . Someone could make good use of his airsuit . Almost as good use as the alga tanks could of his body . For a time , then , he stood looking . The mountainside ran in dark scaurs and fantastically carved pinnacles , down to the softly **28;2121;TOOLONG plain . A crater on the near horizon rose out of its own blue shadow like a challenge to the deep purple sky . In this thin air  --  he could just hear the wind 's ghostly whistle  --  Mars gave to his gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , subtle , and abstract as a torii gate before a rock garden . When he glanced away from the shrunken but dazzling-bright sun , he could see stars . He felt at peace , almost happy . Perhaps the cause was simply that now , after weeks , he had a full ration of oxygen . I ought n't to waste it , though , he thought . He was pleased by the steadiness of his fingers when he closed the valve . Then he was surprised that his unbelieving self bowed over both hands to the Lodestar and said , " Namu Amida Butsu . " He opened his faceplate . That is a gentle death . You are unconscious within thirty seconds.  --  He opened himself and did not know where he was . An enormousroom whose doorways framed a night heaven riotous with suns , galaxies , the green mysterious shimmer of nebulae ? Or a still more huge ship , outward bound so fast that it was as if the Milky Way foamed along the bow and swirled aft in a wake of silver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat at the far end of where-he-was , vague in the twilight cast by sheer distance . Saburo rose and moved in their direction . Maybe , maybe Alice was among them . But was he right to leave Mother that much alone ? I remember her when we got the news . On a Wednesday , when I was free , and I 'd been out by the dump playing ball . I may as wellp70admit to myself , I do n't like some of the guys . But you have to take whoever the school staggering throws up for you . Or do you want to run around by yourself ( remember , no , do n't remember what the Hurricane Gang did to Danny ) or stay always by yourself in the patrolledareas ? So Jake-Jake does throw his weight around , so he does set the dues too high , his drill and leadership sure paid off when the Weasels jumped us last year . They wo n't try that again  --  we killed three , count ' em , three !  --  and I sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be real pretty , Mother did . I 've seen pictures . She 's gotten kind of scrawny , worrying about Dad , I guess , and about how to get along after that last pay cut they screwed the spacefolk with . But when I came in and saw her sitting , not on the sofa but on the carpet , the dingy gray carpet , crying  --  She hung onto that sofa the way she 'd hung on Dad . But why did she have to be so angry at him too ? I mean , what happened was n't his fault . " Fifty billion munits ! " she screamed when we 'd got trying to talk about the thing . " That 's a hundred , two hundred billion meals for hungry children ! But what did they spend it on ? Killing twelve men ! " " Aw , now , wait , " I was saying , " Dad explained that . The resourcesinvolved , uh , are n't identical , " when she slapped me and yelled : " You 'd like to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it almost makes his death worthwhile that you wo n't ! " I should n't have got mad . I should n't have said , " Y-y-you want me to become . . . a desk pilot , a food engineer , a doctor . . . somethingnice and safe and in demand . . . and keep you the way you wanted he should keep you ? " I better stop beating this rail . My fist 'll be no good if I do n't . Oh , someday I 'll find how to make up those words to her . I 'd better not go in just yet . But the trouble was n't Dad 's fault . If things had worked out right , why , we 'd be headed for Alpha Centauri in a couple of years . Her and him and me  --  The planets yonderward , sure , they 're the real treasure . But the ship itself ! I remember Jake-Jake telling me I 'd be dead of boredom inside six months .

Murphy 's Hill ? From Ganymede , Jupiter shows fifteen times as broad as Luna seen from Earth ; and however far away the sun , the king planet reflectsso brilliantly that it casts more than fifty times the radiance that the brightest night of man 's home will ever know . " Here is man 's home , " Catalina Sanchez murmured . Arne Jensen cast her a look which lingered . She was fair to see in the goldenness streaming through the conservatory 's clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist . She sighed and leaned against him . They were scantily clad  --  the colony favored brief though colorful indoor garments  --  and he felt the warmth and silkiness of her . Among the manifold perfumes of blossoms ( on plants everywhereto right and left and behind , extravagantly tall stalks and big flowers of every possible hue and some you would swear were impossible , dreamlike catenaries of vines and labyrinths of creepers ) he caught her summery odor . The sun was down and Jupiter close to full . While the terraformingproject was going rapidly ahead , as yet the moon had too little air to blur vision . Tawny shone that shield , emblazoned with slowly moving cloud bands that were green , blue , orange , umber , and with the jewel-like Red Spot . To know that a single one of the storms raging there could swallow Earth whole added majesty to beauty and serenity ; to know that , without the magnetohydronamic satellites men had orbited around this globe , its surface would be drowned in lethal radiation , added triumph . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rugged horizon . The gold poured soft across crags , cliffs , craters , glaciers , and the machinery of the conquest . Outside lay a great quietness , but here music lilted from the ballroom . Folk had reason to celebrate . The newest electrolysis plantp72had gone into operation and was releasing oxygen at a rate 15 percentabove estimate . However , low-weight or no , you got tired dancing  --  sinceGanymedean steps took advantage , soaring and bounding aloft  --  mirth bubbled like champagne and the girl you admired said yes , she was in a mood for Jupiter watching " I hope you 're right , " Arne said . " Less on our account  --  we have a good , happy life , fascinating work , the best of company  --  than on our children 's . " He squeezed a trifle harder . She did n't object . " How can we fail ? " she answered . " We 've become better than self-sufficient . We produce a surplus , to trade to Earth , Luna , Mars , or plow directly back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " You must think I 'm awfully professorish . Still , really , what can go wrong ? " " I do n't know , " he said . " War , overpopulation , environmental degradation  --  " " Do n't be a gloomy , " Catalina chided him . The lambent light struck rainbows from the tiara of native crystal that she wore in her hair . " People can learn . They need n't make the same mistakes forever . We 'll build paradise here . A strange spit of paradise , yes , where trees soar into a sky full of Jupiter , and waterfalls tumble slowly , slowly down into deep-blue lakes , and birds fly like tiny bright-colored bullets , and deer cross the meadows in ten-meter leaps . . . but paradise . " " Not perfect , " he said . " Nothing is . " " No , and we would n't wish that , " she agreed . " We want some discontent left to keep minds active , keep them hankering for the stars . " She chuckled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them believe things could be better elsewhere . Or nature will  --  Oh ! " Her eyes widened . A hand went to her mouth . And then , frantically , she was kissing him , and he her , and they were clasping and feeling each other while the waltz melody sparkled and the flowers breathed and Jupiter 's glory cataracted over them uncaring whether they existed . He tasted tears on her mouth . " Let 's go dancing , " she begged . " Let 's dance till we drop . " " Surely , " he promised , and led her back to the ballroom . It would help them once more forget the giant meteoroid , among the many which the planet sucked in from the Belt , that had plowedp73into grim and marginal Outpost Ganymede precisely half a decade before the Martian colony was discontinued . Well , I guess people do n't learn . They breed , and fight , and devour , and pollute , till : Mother : " We ca n't afford it . " Dad : " We ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like goblins , like ghosts , from starvation . If Tad were one of them , and somebody said never mind him , we have to build an interstellar ship . . . I wonder how you would react . " Dad : " I do n't know . But I do know this is our last chance . We 'll be operating on a broken shoestring as is , compared to what we need to do the thing right . If they had n't made that breakthrough at Lunar Hydromagnetics Lab , when the government was on the point of closingit down  --  Anyway , darling , that 's why I 'll have to put in plenty of time aboard myself , while the ship is built and tested . My entire gang will be on triple duty . " Mother : " Suppose you succeed . Suppose you do get your preciousspacecraft that can travel almost as fast as light . Do you imaginefor an instant it can  --  an armada can ease life an atom 's worth for mankind ? " Dad : " Well , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me . " Mother : " I 'd feel a monster , safe and comfortable en route to a new world while behind me they huddled in poverty by the billions . " Dad : " My first duty is to you two . However , let 's leave that aside . Let 's think about man as a whole . What is he ? A beast that is born , grubs around , copulates , quarrels , and dies . Uh-huh . But sometimessomething more in addition . He does breed his occasional Jesus , Leonardo , Bach , Jefferson , Einstein , Armstrong , Olveidawhoeveryou think best justifies our being here  --  does n't he ? Well , when you huddle people together like rats , they soon behave like rats . What then of the spirit ?

" Quarrel : till I run from them crying . Well , eight or nine years old . That night , was that the first night I started telling myself stories about Murphy 's Hall ? It is Murphy 's Hall . I say that 's the right place for Dad to be . When Hoo Fong , chief engineer , brought the news to the captain'scabin , the captain sat still for minutes . The ship thrummed around them ; they felt it faintly , a song in their bones . And the light fell from the overhead , into a spacious and gracious room , furnishings , books , a stunning photograph of the Andromeda galaxy , an animation of Mary and Tad ; and weight was steady underfoot , a full gee of acceleration , one light-year per year per year , though this would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewards of relativity . . . a mere two decades to the center of this galaxy , three to the neighbor whose portrait you adored . . . . How hard to grasp that you were dead ! " But the ramscoop is obviously functional , " said the captain , hearing his pedantic phrasing . Hoo Fong shrugged . " It will not be , after the radiation has affectedelectronic parts . We have no prospect of decelerating and returning home at low velocity before both we and the ship have taken a destructive dose . " Interstellar hydrogen , an atom or so in a cubic centimeter , raw vacuum to Earthdwellers at the bottom of their ocean of gas and smoke and stench and carcinogens . To space f olk , fuel , reaction mass , a way to the stars , once you 're up to the modest pace at which you meet enough of those atoms per second . However , your force screens must protect you from them , else they strike the hull and spit gamma rays like a witch 's curse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested . " Unmanned probes had no trouble at better than 99 percent . " " Evidently the system is inadequate for the larger mass of this ship , " the engineer answered . " We should have made its first completetest flight unmanned too . " " You know we did n't have funds to develop the robots for that . " " We can send our data back . The next expedition  --  "  | " I doubt there 'll be any . Yes , yes , we 'll beam the word home . And then , I suppose , keep going . Four weeks , did you say , till the radiation sickness gets bad ? The problem is not how to tell Earth , but how to tell the rest of the men . " Afterward , alone with the pictures of Andromeda , Mary , and Tad , the captain thought : I 've lost more than the years ahead . I 've lost the years behind , that we might have had together . What shall I say to you ? That I tried and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hour I do n't want to lie , most especially not to you three . Did I do right ? Yes . No . O God , oh , shit , how can I tell ? The Moon is rising above the soot-clouds . I might make it that far . Commissioner Wenig was talking about how we should maintain the last Lunar base another few years , till industry can find a substitute for those giant molecules they make there . But was n't the Premier of United Africa saying those industries ought to be forbidden , they 're too wasteful , and any country that keeps them going is an enemy of the human race ? Gunfire rattles in the streets . Some female voice somewhere is screaming . I 've got to get Mother out of here . That 's the last thing I can do for Dad . After ten years of studying to be a food engineer or a doctor , I 'll probably feel too tired to care about the Moon . After another ten years of being a desk pilot and getting fat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax money -- except maybe for defense . In Siberia they 're preaching that strange new missionary religion . And the President of Europe has said that if necessary , his government will denounce the ban on nuclear weapons . The ship passed among the stars bearing a crew of dead bones . After a hundred billion years it crossed the Edge  --  not the edge of space or time , which does not exist , but the Edge  --  and came to harborat Murphy 's Hall . And the dust which the cosmic rays had made began to stir , andp76gathered itself back into bones ; and from the radiation-corroded skeleton of the ship crept atoms which formed into flesh ; and the captain and his men awoke . They opened themselves and looked upon the suns that went blazing and streaming overhead . " We 're home , " said the captain . Proud at the head of his men , he strode uphill from the dock , towardthe hall of the five hundred and forty doors . Comets flitted past him , novae exploded in dreadful glory , planets turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted by , new life screamed its outrage at being born . The roofs of the house lifted like mountains against night and the light-clouds . The ends of rafters jutted beyond the eaves , carved into dragon heads . Through the doorway toward which the captain led his crew , eight hundred men could have marched abreast . But a single form waited to greet them ; and beyond him was darkness . When the captain saw who that was , he bowed very deeply . The other took his hand . " We have been waiting , " he said . The captain 's heart sprang . " Mary too ? " " Yes , of course . Everyone . " Me . And you . And you . And you in the future , if you exist . In the end , Murphy 's Law gets us all . But we , my friends , must go to him the hard way . Our luck did n't run out . Instead , the decision that could be made was made . It was decided for us that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering what lies beyond their skies  --  is not supposed to have either discipline or dreams . No , our job is to make everybody nice and safe and equal , and if this happens to be impossible , then nothing else matters . If I went to that place  --  and I 'm glad that this is a lie  --  I 'd keep remembering what we might have done and seen and known and been and loved . Murphy 's Hell.  |p77Here  we return for a while to standard science fiction , indeed to space opera  --  but , I hope , with a difference . Again the basic plot idea came from John Campbell : what might be the effect of a supernova , a gigantic exploding star , within a few light-years of an inhabited planet ? But as soon as I started work , I realized that the story could n't really be about that . Instead , it had to be aboutWell , you decide for yourself . Of readers who have commented on it to me , the young have generally confessed to being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going on . However , this dichotomy probably is n't complete . What do you yourself make of it ? E GUARD the great Pact ; but the young generations , the folk of the star frontier , so often do not understand . They avail themselves of our ordinary work . ( Ship Harpsong of Nerthus , out of Highsky for David 's Landing , is long overdue . . . . Please forecast the competition which a cybernation venture on Oasis would probably face after the older firms elsewhere learned that a market had been established . . . . Bandits reported . . . . How shall we deal with this wholly strange race of beings we have come upon ? ) But then we step in their own paths and say , " Thou shalt not . " And suddenly we are the Cordys , the enemy . The case of the slain world named Good Luck is typical . Now that the Service is ready , after a generation , to let the truth be known , I can tell you about Trevelyan Micah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest , that you may judge the rights or wrongs for yourself . In those days Trevelyan spent his furloughs on Earth . He said its quiet , its intellectuality , were downright refreshing , and he could get all the rowdiness he wanted elsewhere . But of course his customp78put him at the nerve center of the Service , insofar as an organization operating across a fraction of the galaxy can have one . He got a larger picture than most of his colleagues of how it fared with the Pact . This made him more effective . He was a dedicated man . I suspect he also wanted to renew his humanity at the wellspring of humankind , he who spent most of his life amidst otherness . Thus he was strengthened in his will to be a faithful guardian . Not that he was a prig . He was large and dark , with aquiline features and hard aquamarine eyes . But his smile was ready , his humor was dry , his tunic and culottes were always in the latest mode , he enjoyed every aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the Good Luck affair , he had been living for a while at Laugerie Haute , which is in the heart of the steep , green , altogether beautiful Dordogne country . His girl of the moment had a stone house that was built in the Middle Ages against an overhanging cliff . Its interior renovation did not change its exterior ancientness , which made it seem a part of the hills or they a part of it . But in front grew bushes , covering a site excavated centuries ago , where flint-working reindeer hunters lived for millennia while the glacier covered North Europe . And daily overhead through the bright sky glided a spear that was the Greenland-Algeria carrier ; and at night , across the stars where men now traveled , moved sparks that were spaceships lifting out of Earth 's shadow . In few other parts of the planet could you be more fully in the oneness of time . " You do n't have to go , not yet , " Braganza Diane said , a little desperately because she cared for him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Fraid I do , " he said . " The computer did n't ring me up for fun . In fact , it 's a notoriously sober-sided machine . " When she did n't answer his grin , he explained : " The data banks show I 'm the only person available who 's dealt with , uh , a certain individual before . He 's a slippery beast , with sharp teeth , and experience might make the critical quantum of difference . " " It better ! " She curbed the tears that could have caused him to think her immature and bent her lips upward . " You will add . . . the rest of this leave . . . to your next , and spend it with me . Wo n't you ? " " I 'd love to , " he said , carefully making no promises . He kissedp79her , where they stood in the hay scent of summer . They went back to the house for a while . After he packed his kit and phoned good-bye to some neighbors  --  landholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting  --  she flew him to Aerogare Bordeaux . Thence he took a carrier to Port Nevada . The computer had briefed him so well that he could go straight to work , and he wanted to catch Murdoch Juan at ease if possible . His timing was good . Sunset was slanting across western North America and turning the mountains purple when he arrived . The city walled him off from that serenity as he entered . It shouldered big square buildings above streets in which traffic clamored ; the growl of machines perpetually underlay the shrill of voices ; frantically flickeringsigns drowned out the stars ; humans and nonhumans hustled , jostled , chiseled , brawled , clashed , stole , evangelized , grew rich , grew poor , came , went , and were forgotten ; beneath a tawdry front was that heedless vigor which the cargo ships bring from their homes to enclaves like this . Trevelyan allowed himself a brief " Phew ! " when the stinks rolled around him . He knew this town , on a hundred different worlds . He knew how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Murdoch 's crew who could tell him where the boss was this evening . It turned out to be no dive , with the smoke of a dozen drugs stinging the eyes , but the discreet and expensive Altair House . There a headwaiter , live though extraterrestrial , would not conducthim to his man . Captain Murdoch had requested privacy for a conference . Captain Murdoch was entitled to  --  Trevelyan showed his identification . It gave him no legal prerogative ; but a while ago the Service had forestalled a war on the headwaiter 's native planet . Upstairs , he chimed for admittance to the room . He had been told that Captain Murdoch 's dinner guest had left , seemingly well pleased , while Captain Murdoch and his female companion stayed behind with a fresh order of champagne , vigorator , and other aids to celebration . " Come in , come in ! " boomed the remembered hearty voice . The door dilated and Trevelyan trod through . " Huh ? I thought you were  --  Sunb1aze ! You again ! " Murdoch surged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ andp80paintings , sparkling glassware , drift of music and incense . Then , tiger softly , he came around the table to a fist 's reach of Trevelyan . He was as tall , and broader in the shoulders . His features were rugged , deeply weathered , blond hair and a sweeping blond moustache . His clothes were too colorful to be stylish on Earth , but he wore them with such panache that you did n't notice . The woman remained seated . She was as vivid in her way as he in his , superbly formed , the classicism of her face brought to life by the nearly Asian cheekbones ; and she owned the rare combination of pure white skin and fox-red hair . Yet she was no toy . When she saw Murdoch thus taken aback , Trevelyan read shock upon her . It was followed by unflinching enmity . He bowed to her . " Forgive me if I intrude , " he said . Murdoch relaxed in a gust of laughter . " Oh , sure , sure , Mike , you 're forgiven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He clapped hands on the agent 's shoulders . " How 've you been , anyway ? How many years since last ? " " Five or six . " Trevelyan tried to smile back . " I 'm sorry to bother you , but I understand you 're shipping out day after tomorrow , which no doubt means you 'll be busy for the prior twenty-four hours . " " Right , buck , " Murdoch said . " This here tonight is our liftoffparty . However , it began with business  --  lining up a financial backer for later on  --  so it may as well continue that way a few microseconds . " The tone stayed genial , but the gaze was pale and very steady . " Got to be business , do n't it ? You did n't track me down just to wish an old sparring partner a bony voyage . " " Not really , " Trevelyan admitted . Murdoch took his arm and led him to the table . " Well , sit yourselfand have a glug with us . Faustina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Juan has spoken of you , " the woman said distantly . Trevelyan eased into a chair . His muscles relaxed , one by one , that his brain might be undistracted in the coming duel . " I hope he used language suitable to a lady , " he said . " I 'm from New Mars , " she snapped . " We do n't have time for sex distinctions in our manners . " I might have guessed , he thought . There are n't as many unclaimedplanets habitable by man as is popularly believed ; so the mar/ginal ones get settled too . He could imagine scarring poverty in her background , and Murdoch Juan as the great merry beloved knight who took her from it and would bear her on his saddlebow to the castle he meant to conquer for them . " I did my duty as I saw it , which happened to conflict with CaptainMurdoch 's rights as he saw them , " Trevelyan said . " I was making a fortune off fur and lumber on Vanaheim , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continent , " Trevelyan replied . " You did n't have to come in and talk them into changing the laws on me , " Murdoch said without rancor . He rinsed a glass from the water carafe and filled it with champagne . " Hope you do n't mind this being used first by a financier . " " No . Thank you . " Trevelyan accepted . " And then , when he was honorably engaged as a mercenary  --  " Faustina 's tone held venom . " Bringing modern weapons in against primitives who were no menace , " Trevelyan said . " That 's universally illegal . Almost as illegal as dispossessing autochthons or prior colonists . " " Does your precious Union actually claim jurisdiction over the entire cosmos ? " " Ease off , Faustina , " Murdoch said . " The Union is not a government , although many governments support it , " Trevelyan said to the woman . " This galaxy alone is too big for any power to control . But we do claim the right to prevent matters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able . That includes wrongdoing by our own citizens anywhere . " " The Cordys never jailed me , " Murdoch said . " They only scupperedmy operation . I got away in time and left no usable evidence . No hard feelings . " He raised his glass . Unwillingly , Trevelyan clinked rims with him and drank . " In fact , " Murdoch added , " I 'm grateful to you , friend . You showed me the error of my ways . Now I 've organized a thing that 'll not only make me rich , but so respectable that nobody can belch in my presence without a permit . " Faustina ignited a cigarette and smoked in hard puffs . " I 've been asked to verify that , " Trevelyan said . " Why , everything 's open and honest , " Murdoch said . " You know it already . I got me a ship , never mind how , and went exploringout Eridanus way . I found a planet , uninhabited but colonizable ,  |p82and  filed for a discoverer 's patent . The Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , is a lawfully exploitable world . Here I am on Earth , collecting men and equipment for the preliminarywork of making a defined area safe for humans . You remember . " His manner grew deliberately patronizing . " Check for dangerous organisms and substances in the environment , establish the weather and seismic patterns , et cetera . When we 're finished , I 'll advertisemy real estate and my ferry service to it . For the duration of my patent , I can set the terms of immigration , within limits . Most discoverers just charge a fee . But I aim to supply everything  --  transportationthere , a functioning physical community built in advance , whatever people need to make a good start . That 's why I 've been discussing financial backing . " " Your approach has been tried , " Trevelyan warned , " but never paid off . The cost per capita of a prefabricated settlement is more than the average would-be immigrant can afford . So he stays home , and puff goes the profit . Eventually , the entrepreneur is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not this one , " Murdoch said . " I 'll be charging irresistibly little  --  about half what it 'd cost ' em to buy unimproved land and make their own homes and highways and such out of local materials . They 'll come . " He tossed off the rest of his glass and refilled it . " But why are you curious , you Cordys ? I have n't told you anything that is n't on file . If you wanted to snoop , why did n't you come see me earlier ? " " Because we have too much else on file , " Trevelyan said bitterly . " Our computer did n't get around to correlating certain facts until yesterday . We 're trying to keep the galaxy livable , but it 's too much for us , too diverse- " " Good ! " Faustina said . He gave her a grave look . " Be careful , my lady , " he said , " or one day a piece of that diversity may kill you . " Murdoch scowled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been nice , but this is my evening out with my girl and you 're obviously on a fishing expedition . You have n't got a thing against me , legally , have you ? Very well , get out . " Trevelyan tensed where he sat . " Or good night , if you prefer , " Murdoch said in friendlier wise . Trevelyan rose , bowed , murmured the polite formulas , and left.  |p83Inwardly  he felt cold . There had been more than a gloat in his enemy'smanner ; there had been the expectation of revenge . It looks as if I 'd better take direct action , he thought . The Campesino cleared from orbit , ran out of the Solar System on grays , and went into hyperdrive in the usual fashion . She was a long-range cruiser with boats and gear for a variety of conditions . Aboard were Murdoch , Faustina , half a dozen spacemen , and a score of technicians . The Service speedster Genji followed , manned by Trevelyan and that being whose humanly unpronounceable name was believed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more art than science and more witchcraft than either . Campesino could easily be tracked while in the normal mode  --  by amplified sight , thermal radiation , radar , neutrinos from the powerplant . But once she went over to the tachyon mode , only a weak emission of superlightparticles was available . And Murdoch also had detectors , surely kept wide open . With skill and luck , Genji could stay at the effective edge of the field she was observing , while it masked her own . For this to be possible , however , she must be much smaller as well as much faster than the other craft . Therefore nothing more formidable than her could be used . She did have a blast cannon , a couple of heavy slugthrowers , and several one-meter dirigible missiles with low-yield nuclear warheads . But Trevelyan would have been surprised if Murdoch'speople did n't build themselves huskier weapons en route . He sat for hours at the cone , staring into the jeweled blackness of its star simulacrum , while the ship murmured around him and the subliminal beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " I think we 've done it . " He pointed to the instruments . A hunter 's exultation lifted within him . " They are definitely sheering off the Eridanus course . " " They may have become aware of us , or they may do so later , and attack , " replied the flat artificial voice of Smokesmith . " We take that chance , " Trevelyan agreed . " I ca n't quite believe it of Murdoch , though . He plays rough , but I do n't know about any cold-blooded murders he 's done . " " Our information concerning his world line is fragmentary , andp84zero about its future segment . Furthermore , available data indicate that his companions are quite unintegrate . " " M-m-m , yes , hard cases , none Earth-born , several nonhumans from raptor cultures among them . That was one fact which alerted us . " " What else ? We departed too hurriedly for me to obtain entire background , I being ignorant of the biological and social nuances among your species . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assign the first and presumably best agent he could , and there were never many nonhumans at Australia Center . Homo Sapiens is a wolfish creature ; two of him can end with ripping each other apart , on an indefinitely long voyage in as cramped a shell as this . But even when our agents have gentler instincts , we try to make up teams out of diverse breeds . The members must be compatible in their physical requirements but , preferably , different enough in psychologies and abilities that they form a whole which is more than its parts . The trouble was , Trevelyan had never before encountered a being from the planet men called Reardon 's . He had heard of them , but space is too full of life for us to remember it all , let alone meet it . Smokesmith 's barrel-like body stood about 140 centimeters high on four stumpy , claw-footed legs . Four tentacles ringed the top of it , each ending in three boneless fingers whose grip was astonishing . The head was more like a clump of fleshy blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward signs of sense organs , though Trevelyan did n't know how these worked . Withal , Smokesmithwas handsome in his ( ? ) fashion . Indeed , the mother-of-pearl iridescence on his rugose torso was lovely to watch . The man decided on a straightforward approach . " Well , " he said , " the fact that Murdoch is involved was in itself suspicious . He probably came to Earth to outfit , rather than some colonial world where he is n't known , because he would n't attract attention . " " I should extrapolate otherwise , when few commercial ventures originate on Earth . " " But the average Terrestrial has n't got the average colonist 's lively interest in such matters . The port cities are mostly ignored by the rest of the planet , a regrettable necessity to be kept within proper bounds . Then too , Murdoch would have a better chance ofp85getting substantial but close-mouthed  --  uh , that means secretive  --  money help on Earth , which is still the primary banker of the humans. , . species . And finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molecular file at Center . . . that fact makes the data flow so huge that Murdoch might well have completed his business and departed before the continuous search-and-correlation noticedhim . " " What was smelled , then , to excite suspicion ? I do not hypothesizethat the initial stimulus was the composition of his crew . " " No . We checked that out later . Nor did the economics of his project look especially interesting . Doubtless his ready-built communitywill be a wretched clutter of hovels ; but caveat emptor , he 'll be within the law , and word will soon get around not to buy from him . " No , the real anomaly is the equipment he ordered . The report on this Good Luck of his is complete enough that you can fairly well predict what a ground-preparation gang will need . The planet 's smaller than Earth , relatively cold and arid , relatively thin atmosphere . But it has a magnetic field and a weak sun ; hence the radiation background is low . " " What is required would depend on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sell to humans . Not Earth humans , naturally . Colonial ones , from all over . We wo n't be able to monitor every embarkation and debarkation , any except a tiny fraction . Not when we are as few as we are , with so much else to do . And local authorities wo n't care . They 'll be too glad to get rid of excess population . Besides , most colonials are anarchic oriented ; they wo n't stand for official inquiries into their business . " Trevelyan blinked in surprise . " What started me off on that ? " " Conceivably an element of your mentation has sensed a thought . " " If so , it 's a hunch too faint to identify . Well . Why does n't he have water-finding gear with him , drills and explosives to start forminglakes , that kind of stuff ? Why does he have a full line of radiationspotters and protective suits ? The biological laboratory he 's assembled is n't right for Good Luck either ; it 's meant to study life forms a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get the idea . " " And now he has changed course . " Smokesmith considered the indicators with whatever he used to see . " A geodesic , which will bring him in the direction of Scorpius. "  | " Huh ? You do n't have to ask the computer ? . . . Trouble is , no law says he must go to his announced destination , or tell us why he did n't . " Trevelyan smiled with shut lips . " Nor does any law say we ca n't tail along . " A keening broke from Smokesmith , made not with his vocoder but with his own tympani . It wavered up and down the scale ; a brief shakenness in his nerves told Trevelyan it entered the subsonic . Odors rolled upon the air , pungencies like blood and burnt sulfur and others men do not know . " Good Cosmos , what 're you doing ? " he exclaimed . " It is an old communication of my infraculture . Of whetted winds , frost , a mountain that is a torch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will to pursue that which has poison fangs . .. . Enough . " Five hundred and twenty-eight light-years from Sol , the sky ahead suddenly blazed . Trevelyan had been meditating upon his philosophy . That , and reading , and listening to music tapes , and tinkering with handicrafts , and physical exercises , had been his refuge from the weary weeks . Smokesmith was a decent being in his way , but too alien for games or conversation . When asked how he passed the time , with no apparentmotion save of his endlessly interweaving arms , he replied : " I make my alternate life . Your language lacks the necessary con-cepts . " The blossoming of what had been merely another , slowly waxing blue star , jerked Trevelyan to alertness . He sat up , clenched hands on chair arms , and stared at the simulacrum until his vision seemed to drown in those glittering dark depths . The star climbed in brilliance even as he watched , for Genji passed the wave front of the initial explosion and entered that which had come later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Supernova ! " And still it flamed higher , until its one searing point gave fifty times the light that full Luna does to Earth , ten million times the light of the next most luminous  --  and nearby  --  sun . Although the screens throttled down that terrible whiteness , Trevelyan could not look close to it , and his vision was fogged with shining spots for minutes after the glimpse he had first gotten.  |p87Smokesmith  's claws clicked on the deck of the corm section as the Reardonite entered . Trevelyan caught a hackle-raising whiff from him and knew he was equally awed . Perhaps his expressionless phrasingwas a defense : " Yes , a supernova of Type II , if the theoretical accounts I have witnessed are correct . They are estimated to occur at the rate of one every fifty-odd years in the galaxy . The remnants of some have been investigated , but to date no outburst has been observed within the range of recorded explorations . " " We 've gone beyond that range already , " the man whispered . He shook himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Approximately . No change in course . " " Ca n't be coincidence . He must have traveled far , looking for game the Cordys would n't take from him , and  --  " Roughly : " Let 's get some readings . " Instruments , astrophysical files carried on every Service vessel , and computation produced a few answers . The star was about 150 parsecs away , which meant it had died five centuries ago . It had been a blue giant , with a mass of some ten Sols , an intrinsic luminosity of perhaps 50,000 ; but the Scorpian clouds had hidden it from early Terrestrial astronomers , and modern scientists were as yet too busy to come this far afield . So wild a burning could not go on for many million years . Instabilitiesbuilt up until the great star shattered itself . At the peak of its explosion , it flooded forth energy equal to the output of the rest of the galaxy . That could last for no more than days , of course . Racing down the light-years , Trevelyan saw the lurid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nebula born of escaped gases , rich in new nuclei of the heavier elements , destined at last to enter into the formation of new suns and planets . Instruments picked out the core of the star : whitely shining , fiercer still in the X-ray spectrum , lethal to come near . But it collapsed rapidly beneath its own monstrous gravitation , to the size of a dwarf , a Jupiter , an Earth . At the end it would be so dense that nothing , not even light , could leave ; and it would have vanished from the universe . Trevelyan said with bleak anger : " He did n't report it . The information that 's already been lost as the wave front swelled  --  " " Shall we return at once ? " the Reardonite asked  | " Well . . . no , I suppose not . If we let Murdoch go , Cosmos knows what deviltry might happen . There 'll be other supernovas , but a dead sentience does n't come back . " " We have a strong indication of his goal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been nervously loading . " Examine the photomultiplier screen , and next these . " Fingertendrilssnaked across dial faces . " The star to which I point is an ordinary G3 sun within a hundred light-years of the supernova . Proper motions show that it was somewhat closer at the time of the eruption . Our study object is on an unmistakable intercept track . It is plausible that this is meant to terminate there . " " But  --  No ! " Trevelyan protested . " What can he want ? " " The dosage received by any planet of the lesser sun , through the cosmic rays given off by the larger at its maximum , was in the thousands of roentgens , delivered in a period of days . Atmosphere and magnetic field would have provided some shielding , but the effect must nonetheless have been biologically catastrophic . Presumably , though , most lower forms of life would survive , especially vegetable and marine species . A new ecological balance would soon be struck , doubtless unstable and plagued by a high mutation rate but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated in certain areas by natural processes , would make caution advisable to the present time . But on the whole , this hypothetical planet could now be salubrious for your race or mine , if it otherwise resembles our homes sufficiently . I might add that it has been conjectured that accidents of this sort were responsible for periods of massive extinctionon numerous worlds , including , I have absorbed , your own home sphere . " Trevelyan scarcely heard the flat words . All at once he was confrontinghorror . When the yellow sun was a disk , too lightful for bare eyes but softly winged with corona and zodiacal glow in a step-down screen : then the supernova nebula , thirty parsecs off , was only an irregular blur , a few minutes across , among the constellations opposite , as if a bit of the Milky Way had drifted free . One had trouble imagining how it had raged in these skies four hundred years ago . Nor did interplanetaryspace any longer have an unusual background count ; norp89did the seven attendant worlds that Genji 's cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false impression , Trevelyan knew . Every world is a wilderness of uncountably many uniquenesses . But the third one out , on which his attention focused , resembled Earth . He was confined to optical means of study . Beams and probes might be detected aboard Campesino . Murdoch had gone out of hyper into normal mode several millions of kilometers back . His shadowers necessarily followed suit . Then  --  lest he spot their neutrino emission , as they were now tracking him by his  --  they stopped the fusion generators and orbited free at their considerable distance , drawing power from the accumulators . " The study object is in the final phase of approach to atmosphereof the terrestroid planet , " Smokesmith announced . " I 'm scarcely surprised , " Trevelyan answered . He looked up from his meters and notes . " Apparently it is as terrestroid as any you 'll ever find , too . Air , irradiation , size , mass as gotten from the satellites  --  nearly identical . Those are two small , fairly close-in moons , by the way ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oceans will be kept from stagnation . Twenty-eight-hour spin , twelve-degree tilt . Mean temperature a touch higher than Earth 's , no polar caps , somewhat less land area . . . an interglacial macroclimate , I 'd guess . In short , aside from pockets of leftover radioactivity , idyllic . " " And possible ecological difficulties , " the Reardonite said . Trevelyan winced . " Damn , did you have to remind me ? " He left off peering , leaned back in his chair , held his chin , and scowled . " Question is , what do we do about Murdoch ? He does n't seem to have committed any violation except failure to register a discovery . And we probably could n't prove this is n't his own first time here , that he did n't come this way on impulse . Besides , the offense is trivial . " " Do methods not exist of compelling humans to speak truth ? " " Yes . Electronic brainphasing . Quite harmless . But our species has rules against involuntary self-incrimination . So it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as I said , I 've no real case against him . " " Need we do more than report back ? Authorized expeditions could then be dispatched . " " Back ' is a mighty long ways . What might he do here mean/while ? Of course  --  hm  --  if Murdoch does n't suspect we 're on to him , he may proceed leisurely with his preparations , giving us a chance to  --  " " The study object has ceased to emit . " " What ? " Trevelyan surged from his chair . He abraded his arm on his companion 's integument , so fast did he brush by to look for himself . The indications were subtle , because the normal neutrino count is always high . But this tracer included a computer which identifiedengine sign amidst noise and put its volume on a single dial . That needle had fallen to zero . Chilled , Trevelyan said : " He 's going down on accumulators and aerodynamics . By the time we come in range for a different tracking method , he can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchanging , but an acrid odor jetted from him and the petals of his face stirred . " Apparently he does not fear detection from the ground . We observe no trace of atomic energy , hence doubtless no one capable of locating it . The probability is that he desires to remove us and none else from his trail . " " Yeh . " Trevelyan began to pace , back and forth between the caging bulkheads . " We half expected he 'd tag us somewhere along the line , when I 'd already put him on the qui vive in Port Nevada . But why 's he telling us unequivocally that he has ? " " In my race , messages are always intended as vectors on the world line of the percipient . " " In mine too , sort of . " Trevelyan 's strides lengthened . " What does Murdoch hope to get us to do by thumbing his nose at us ? We have two alternatives . We can go straight back , or we can land first for a closer look . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we can have returned . " " That 's the black deuce of it , my friend . The very nearest Servicebase where we could originate any kind of investigatory expedition is , urn , Lir , I suppose , if they are n't still too busy with the Storm Queen affair . There are frontier planets closer than that , full of men who 'll gladly swarm here for a chance of striking it rich . And if they can also do the Cordys one in the eye , why , fine . " " Furthermore , " Smokesmith pointed out , " we have no clear proof that anything is involved sufficiently important to justify a longrangemission . The supernova , yes . That is a scientific treasure . Butp91here we have merely a seemingly uninhabited planet . Why should a base commander who does not know Murdoch 's past  --  especially a nonhuman base commander who can not ingest its significance  --  assumehe has an unlawful purpose ? Will he not expect Murdoch to request an inspection team , that a patent of discovery may be issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we who guard the great Pact . Often we must pass by tracks that may well lead toward a hidden evil , because we know about another beast elsewhere . Or we learn of something that was wrong at the beginning and should have been stopped , but whose amendment now would be a worse wrong . We have Nerthus , for example , always before us : a human colony founded and flourishing , then learning that native intelligent life did exist . We are fortunate that in that case the interests of the two species are reconcilable , with endless difficulty . " Does Murdoch wish us to return in alarm bearing data inadequate to provoke prompt official action ? " Smokesmith queried . " That seems plausible . Coming as he lately did from the Union 's Scorpian march , he must be better informed than we about current situations there . Thus , he might know we can get no help at Lir . " " We can  --  we can even commandeer civilian ships and personnel  --  if yonder planet has sentient beings on it . Clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply be plundering them . " " It is improbable that such are alive . " " True . But if dead  --  " Trevelyan stopped . He looked long outward . Unmagnified , the world was a point of light , a clear and lovely blue . But close in would be mapless immensity . The other crew would have had ample chance to conceal their vessel . They could be anywhere , preparing anything . They surely outnumbered and outgunned him . He hated to imagine big , bluff Murdoch Juan as planning murder . On the other hand , Faustina might , and she had had this entire voyage in which to be the only human female . . . . Resolution crystallized . " We 're going in , " he said . They approached slowly , both to observe in detail and to make certain preparations . Circling in the fringes of atmosphere , they confirmedthe thing they had guessed at . This had been a peopled world . The people had been slain.  |p92Were  there survivors , there would be evidence of them . Civilizationmight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anarchy , and famine after crops perished in fields now brushland or desert . But savage descendants of a city-building race would live in villages . Genii 's sensors would register their very campfires . Besides , it was more reasonable that some comeback would have been made , howeverweak . For the sleet of cosmic radiation harmed no buildings , no tools or machines , no books , little , indeed , except what was alive . Gazing into a viewscreen , where clouds parted briefly to show high towers by a lake , Trevelyan said : " Populous , which means they had efficient agriculture and transportation , at least in their most advancedregions . I can identify railway lines and the traces of roads . Early industrial , I 'd guess , combustion engines , possible limited use of electricity . . . . But they had more aesthetic sense , or something , than most cultures at that technological level . They kept beauty around them . " He hauled his thoughts away from what that implied . If he did not stay impersonal , he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Smokesmith wondered . He appeared to have no trouble maintaining detachment . But then , he did not feel humanlike emotions , as Trevelyan judged the dead beings had . " Shelter was available . " " Maybe they did n't know about radioactivity . Or maybe the escapers were too few , too scattered , too badly mutated . Anyhow , they 're gone  --  Hold ! " Trevelyan 's hands danced over the board . Genii swung about , backtracked , and came to hover . Atmosphere blurred the magnified view , but beams , detectors , and computer analysis helped . A town stood on an island in a wide river . Thus , despite the bridges that soared from bank to bank , it was not thickly begrown by vegetation . What had entered was largely cleared away : recent work , the rawness identifiable . The job had been done by machines , a couple of which stood openly in a central plaza . Trevelyan could n't spot details , but never doubted they were Earthmaderobotic types . Several buildings had been blasted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the rubble shoved aside . He got no indications of current activity , but strong electronic resonance suggested that a modern power network was partly completed . " Murdoch , " Trevelyan said like a curse . " Can you obtain indications of his ship ? " the Reardonite asked  | " No . When he detected us approaching , he must have moved her , and screened as well as camouflaged the hull . Maybe he hoped we would n't chance to notice what he 's been up to , or maybe this is another gibe . Certainly he must 've gotten busy here the instant he landed , after choosing the site on his first visit . " Trevelyan put the speedster back into orbit . For a while the conn held only a humming silence . The planet filled half the sky with clouds , seas , sunrises and sunsets ; the other half was stars . " No autochthons left , " Smokesmith mused at last . " Their relics are of limited scientific interest . Will this be adjudged grounds for sending armed craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop ? " " Supposing it is  --  that 's uncertain , as you say , but supposing it is  --  can they stop him ? " Trevelyan seized the controls again . The power hum deepened . " Prepare for descent . " He chose a city near the edge of morning , that he might have a long daylight . A mole jutted from the waterfront into an emeraldand-sapphirebay . Sonic beams declared it to be of reinforced concrete , as firm as the day it was dedicated . He landed there , and presently walked forth . A gray sled would have taken him faster and easier , but part of his aim was to get to know somewhat about those who were departed . His ship , all systems on standby , fell behind him like a coppery cenotaph . He did n't worry about the safety of the environment . Murdoch had proven that for him . What had still to be learned was mere detail : for instance , what imported crops would do well ? Any number , Trevelyan felt sure . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been more so before the catastrophe , but it remained wonderful enough , and nature was fast healing the wounds . The bay glittered and chuckled between golden-green hills . At its entrance began an ocean ; coming down , he had identified fantasticallybig shoals of marine plants and animals . No wings rode the wind that rumpled his hair . Most , perhaps all vertebrates were extinct . But lower forms had survived the disaster . Insects , or their equivalent , swarmed on delicate membranes that often threw back the sunlight in rainbows . Silvery forms leaped from the water . The wind smelled of salt , iodine , and life.  |p94Overhead  wandered some clouds , blue-shadowed in a dazzlingly blue heaven . At this season , the supernova was aloft by day , invisible . Dis-aster , Trevelyan thought with a shudder . How little had Earth 's ancient astrologers known of how terrible a word they were shaping ! But the day was sunny , cool , and peaceful . He walked shoreward , looking . The watercraft had sunk or drifted free of their rotted lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could see a few where they lay , somewhat preserved . The gracious outlines of the sailboats did not astonish him ; that demand was imposed by natural law . But his eyes stung to think that the dead had loved sloops and yawls as much as he did . And they had put bronze figureheads on many whose green-corroded remnants hinted at flowers , wings , flames , anything fair and free . A large ship had drifted aground . It had been iron-hulled and , judging from the stacks , steam-propelled . But it , no , she had also been designed to look like a dancer on the waves . He neared the quay . A row of wooden warehouses ( ? ) was partly moldered away , partly buried under vines . Nevertheless he could make out how roofs once swept in high curves that the doorwaysmatched . A rusting machine , probably a crane , was decorated at the end of its lifting arm with a merry animal face . He stood for some while before an arch at the head of the mole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not photographic . It had a swing of line and mass that woke a pulse in Trevelyan , it was not quite like anything he had ever seen before . But the bipeds with their long slim six-fingered hands , long necks , and long beaked heads , came through to him as if still alive . He almost thought he could hear their stone cloaks flap in the wind . Walking farther into the city , he began to find their bones . Carrion eaters had seldom or never disturbed them . Dust blew in , settled on pavement , became soil ; seeds followed , struck frail roots that gradually crumbled brick and concrete ; bushes and vines grew over that first carpet and up the walls ; those kinds of trees that survived extended their range into the domains of trees that had not , and beyond that into farm and town . But the invasion was slow . The wilderness had all the time in the world . It was in full occupation of the shoreward edges of this city , and reducing the next line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought with a hurtful smile ) sappers had won this near the waterfront . The buildings of granite , marble , and masonry rose tall , washed by rain and sunlight , little damaged by weather , only occasional creepersblurring their outlines . Like the relief sculpture on their walls , they leaped and soared , not as man-built skyscrapers do but in that peculiar rhythm which made their heights seem to fly . They were colonnaded , balustraded , many-windowed , and kept some of the coloring that once softened their austerity . Trevelyan wondered at the absence of parks or gardens . His observations from altitude had suggested a deep-reaching love of landscape and care for it . And floral motifs were about the commonestdecorations . Well , the dwellers had not been human ; it would take long to get some insight into what their race psyche might have been . Maybe they enjoyed the contrast of art and openness . If this place was typical , every city was a delight to live in . At some economic sacrifice , the dwellers had avoided filling their air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be sure , they were lucky that no heating was required . But as far as Trevelyan had been able to ascertain , industrial plants were widely scattered outside urban limits , connected by railways . There were no automobiles , though that was probably within the technological capabilities . Instead , he found the depictions , and some bones , of large quadrupeds that served like horses ; he also identified the hulks of what appeared to have been public vehicles with primitive electric motors . It was hard to tell after four hundred years , but he at least got the impression that , while theirs was a productive and prosperous civilization , the dwellers had not created overly much trash either . They could have foreseen the problemand taken steps . He 'd like to know . Not that they were saints . He came upon statues and dimmedmurals which showed combat . Twice , above inscriptions he wouldnever interpret , he saw a being dressed in rags bursting chains offhimself ; no doubt somebody put those chains on in the first place . But oftenest he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work , teaching , discovery , or the sheer splendor of being alive . He entered courtyards , walked past dried pools and fountains , on into the buildings . Few had elevators , which was suggestive sincethe culture could have supplied them . He noted that the shafts of thewide circular staircases would easily accommodate gray lifts . Thep96murals indoors were scarcely faded ; their vividness took some of the grief off him . Nevertheless , and although he was not superstitious or even especially religious , he knocked on the first door he came to . Every door was sliding or folding , none bore locks or latches , which again implied unusual traits . The majority of apartments had been deserted . Cloth had decayed , metal tarnished , plaster cracked , and dust fallen centimeters thick . But the furnishings remained usableby humans , who were formed quite like the dwellers . Clean and patch up ; restore the water supply ; make do with the airily shaped oil lanterns , if need be , and a camp stove since the original owners did n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divans , beds , intricately grained floors : and you would be altogether comfortable . Soon power would become available , and you could change the place around at your leisure until it was ideal . Early in the game , though , you 'd better get rid of those pictures , papers , enigmatic tools , and shelves full of books . They could be disturbing to live with . As the hours passed , Trevelyan did find skeletons in a few apartments . Either these individuals had died by surprise , like those he infrequently noticed in the streets , or they desired privacy for their final day . One lay in a kind of chaise longue , with a book upon what had been the lap . Twice he found small skeletons covered by a large one . Did the mother understand that death was coming from the sky ? Yes , she could see it up there , a point of radiance too brilliant to look near , surrounded by the auroras it evoked in this atmosphere . Probablyshe knew the death was everywhere . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered the ossuary , Trevelyan decided there must be several , and this was how the average dweller had elected to go . It was in a large hall  --  theater ? auditorium ? temple ? The most susceptiblemust already have died , and radiation sickness be upon the rest . In man it approaches its terminus with nausea , vomiting , hair coming out , internal bleeding , blood from the orifices and eyes , strengthlessness , fever , and delirium . Doubtless it was similar for the dwellers . Outside were the remnants of several improvised coal furnaces . Their pipes fed into the sealed hall , carbon monoxide generators . Bones and rusted weapons nearby suggested the operators had finishedtheir task and then themselves . The door was the single tightlyp97fastened one Trevelyan had encountered , but being wooden it yielded to his boot in a cloud of punk . Beyond lay the skeletons of adults , hundreds of them , and many more young , and toys , games , cups , banners , musical instruments  --  I do n't know what they did at that party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same guts , we 'd tell the children that Carnival came early this year . He walked back out into the bright quiet . Something like a butterflywent past , though its wings were fairer than anything evolved on Earth . Being a little of an antiquarian , he said aloud : " The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away ; I will not bless the name of the Lord . But I will remember . Oh , yes , I will remember . " He had not gone much farther toward the middle of town when he heard a thunder rumble . Looking up past the towertops , he saw the great shining form of Campesino descend . She came between him and the sun and covered him with her shadow . Reflexively , he took shelter in a doorway . One hand dropped to his pistol . With a sour grin at himself , he activated the tiny radio transceiverin his tunic pocket . On the standard band , he heard Murdoch'svoice : " Cordy ahoy ! Respond ! " The empty speedster made no reply . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced on her grays . " You ! " Murdoch barked . " We picked up your tachyons halfway to here . We followed you down by your neutrinos . Do n't try bluffing us about having a friend in reserve . You 're alone , and we 've got a cyclic blast zeroed in , and I want to speak with you . " More silence in the receivers . Trevelyan felt the sweat on his ribs , under his arms , and smelled it . He could not foretell what would happen . At best , he had sketched behavior patterns Murdoch might adopt and responses he might make . His plan amounted to creating a situation where he could improvise . . . whether successfully or not . A barely distinguishable background growl : " No one inside , I 'd guess . Exploring the city ? " " Could be , " Murdoch said . " Odd they 'd leave their boat un-guarded . " " A trap ? " " Well  --  maybe . Do n't seem Cordy style , but maybe we better keep clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down elsewhere , making Genji less of a hostage . He decided to push matters , trod forth , and shot a flash from his gun into the air . It crackled . Ozone touched his nostrils . " Look ! Below ! You , d' you read us ? " Trevelyan saw no sense in giving away the fact that he could listen . He might gain some slight advantage thereby ; and Cosmos knew , with that metal storm cloud hanging above him , he needed whatever help he could get . He waved and jogged off toward the city center , where he had noticed a plaza from above . After a conference he could n't make out , the others did what he would have done in their place . Campesino opened a hatch and discharged a gray sled with a man or two aboard . Not carrying missiles , she could give them no effective armament . But they would hover near Genji and cry warning of anything suspicious . The ship herself dropped behind the towers . When she landed , the ground trembled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his radio speaker , turned on the transmitter , and hastened his trot . Once he accidentally kicked a skull . It rolled aside with a dry clatter . I 'm sorry , he thought to it . That being not altogether alien to him had felt this street underfoot , sunwarmth reflected off cataract-like facades , muscle movement , heartbeat , breath . The city had lived around the being , with friends , loves , traffic , music , pleasure . . . did the race laugh ? I may be joining you soon , he added , and scorned himself for the juvenilism . He emerged not on a square but a golden rectangle . Grassy growth was thrusting up and apart those blocks which had paved it , but the rains of four centuries had not quite washed out the grooves worn by generations of feet . The enclosing buildings were lower here . Their lines bespoke tranquillity rather than excitement , though three of them held the fragments of dazzling stained-glass windows . Numerousskeletons lay prostrated before one . Campesino rose brutal from the plaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ready . They were a hard-looking gang . Murdoch stood at ease , Faustina tensed beside him . Both wore black coveralls with silver ornamentation . Her hair glowed in the light . Trevelyan approached at a reduced pace , hands well away from his pistol . " Mike ! " the adventurer bawled . He threw back his head inp99laughter that made his moustaches vibrate . " Why the chaos did n't I expect you 'd be the one ? " " Who else with you ? " Faustina said . Trevelyan shrugged . " Who with you ? " he countered . " You 've seen our roster , " Murdoch said . " I figured you 'd refuse to board , afraid we 'd grab you , so I came out . " He jerked a thumb at the sheer hull behind . " Got a full complement inside at alert stations . " Trevelyan achieved a smile . " What makes you expect trouble , Juan ? " he asked in his mildest voice . Murdoch blinked . " Why . . . you dogged us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trevelyan said . " Space is free . The Co-ordination Service investigates where it can , but forbids violence to its agents exceptunder extreme necessity . You know that as well as I do . " The guards around shifted stance , muttered among themselves , flicked eyes from side to side . Trevelyan virtually felt the unease in them . " For example , " he drawled , " you 're breaking the law here , first by not reporting a discovery  --  " " We 've only just made it ! " Faustina said . Red stained the white cheekbones . Her fists were clenched . He studied her for a moment , thinking with compassion : She 's afraid I 'll take away her glory  --  her chance to rake in money until she can lose the fear of being poor that was ground into her , and with caution : In an aggressive human personality , fear begets ruthlessness . " Please let me finish , " he said . " I 'm not interested in lodging charges , nor would my superiors be . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom matters . Out of necessity , the Service operates on the old principle that the law should not concernitself with trifles . " She stepped back , breathing hard , lips pulled away from teeth , but plainly bemused . Murdoch 's massive features had grown immobile . " Continue , " he said . " You 've committed a more important breach of law by tamperingwith and destroying material of scientific value . " Trevelyan kept his tone amiable and a faint smile on his mouth . " I refer to that islandcity . But the planet is such an archaeological and biological Golconda that we 'll overlook your indiscretion , we 'll put it down to an amateur 's forgivable enthusiasm , in exchange for the servicep100you 've done to civilization by bringing this world to our knowledge . You 'll remember an agent like me has authority to issue pardons in minor cases . I 'll write you one today , if you wish , and recommend you for next year 's Polaris Medal into the bargain . " He offered his hand . " Stop worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink and go home together . " Murdoch did not take the hand . The big man stood for a while , staring , and the silence of the dead grew and grew . He broke it with a whisper : " Are you serious ? " Trevelyan dropped pretense . He said in a hardened voice , while his nerves felt the surrounding guns : " It 's an honest offer . You alreadyhave Good Luck to make your living off . Be content with that . " " Good Luck ? " Faustina cried . She swept one arm in a taloned arc . " You incredible idiot ! This is Good Luck ! " " I kept hoping it was n't , " Trevelyan said low . " What do you figure I had in mind ? " Murdoch demanded . " Obvious , " Trevelyan sighed . " Here was your real discovery . But how to exploit it ? You could n't get a patent , because the Union would forbid colonization until the scientists finished their researches . Considering the distance , and the shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , that would take at least a hundred years , probably longer . In fact , the odds are we 'd put a secrecy seal on the co-ordinates for a decade or two , to keep unqualified visitors away until a big enough enterprise got started that the scientists could do their own guarding . " " Scientists ! " Faustina nearly shrieked . Murdoch laid a warning grip on her arm . His predator 's gaze stayed on Trevelyan . " What a means to a fortune , though ! " the Co-ordinator said . " You could offer an utterly desirable home , complete with every facility for hundreds of millions of people , at a price the ordinary colonial can afford . You stood to become one of the wealthiest humansthat ever lived . " Well , you went looking for a world we would n't disallow . What you turned up is n't particularly good . But it 's no worse than some which have been settled , and at least does n't have a population alreadysqueezing its meager resources . People would buy your real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them and the cost was not beyond their means . " Some you actually would take to the marginal planet  --  say whenp101an agent like me happened to be around . You 'd lose money on them . But it would n't matter , because most would be shipped here , where entire cities cost you practically nothing . They 'd write home . Your ships would carry the overjoyed mail , maybe censoring it a wee bit to keep us Cordys from getting wind of your enterprise too soon . Not that we 'd be likely to , when we 're run off our feet with urgent cases , and when few people on those thousands of entire worlds give us any active co-operation . You could carry on for a number of years , I 'm sure , before the discrepancies got so glaring that we investigated . " " What 'd you do after you learned ? " Murdoch asked . " Nothing , " Trevelyan said . " How could we displace tens of thousands , maybe millions of men , women , and children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new life , put down roots , begun bringing forth a new generation ? It 'd be a political impossibility , a moral one , maybe a physical one . They 'd fight for their homes , and we could n't bomb them , could we ? " You personally would be subject to  --  in theory , confiscation of your properties and imprisonment of your body . In practice , you 'd have put both where we could n't touch them without more effort and killing than it was worth . You 'd have rigged the colonial government and its constitution early in the game to make you something like the Founding Father president of Good Luck . They 'd fight for you too . So , rather than violate its own prohibition on conquest  --  for the sake of scientific and aesthetic values that 'd already been ruined  --  the Union would accept what you 'd done to it . " Trevelyan closed his mouth . He felt hoarse and tired and wanted a smoke , but did n't dare reach for his pipe under those guns . Murdoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled . " Thanks for the Founding Father title . I had n't thought of that . Sounds like what I need . " " I ca n't allow it , you know , " Trevelyan said . " Why not ? " Murdoch grew curiously earnest . " What 's here , really ? A worldful of bones . I 'm sorry it happened , but dead 's dead . And they were , well , one more race among millions . What can we learn from them that matters ? Oh , I suppose you can hope for a new technique or art form or whatever , that 'll revolutionize civilization . But you prob'ly understand better than me how small that chance is . Meanwhile , yonder we 've got people who 're alive , and hurting , now . "  | " The planet will be opened for settlement , region by region , in due course . " " How long is due course ? How many 'll die during it , that could 've lived happier ? " " Emigrants are always replaced at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact time of migration makes no difference . " " Forget the long run and think about flesh and blood . " Trevelyan 's anger broke his control . " Do n't hand me that guff , Murdoch , " he snapped . " You 're about as altruistic as a blast cannon . " " And you , " Faustina spat , " you 're a machine . I look forward to killing you  --  dismantling you ! " " Wait , wait , there , " Murdoch said . " Ease off and let 's talk sane . " He regarded the ground for a moment before he straightened , faced Trevelyan squarely , and said : " I 'll tell you how it lies . When we knew we were being dogged , we decided to lead you on , because once the supernova got reported , this sector ' ud be swarmed and somebody else might find our Good Luck . " You could 've skited for home without landing . If you 'd done that , we'd 've made for the nearest human planets to here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em free , gotten well dug in before you could raise any action at headquarters . It might 've been enough to stop you from doing anything . " " I assumed that was your plan , " Trevelyan said . " On my way back , I 'll visit every Scorpian world and announce , without specifyinglocation too closely , that this planet is interdicted to preserve cultural values . To come here then , knowingly , will justify and requireviolence by the Service . We do have to maintain the precedent . " " What makes you think you 're going back ? " asked Faustina . She grinned with hatred . " Ease off , " Murdoch repeated . To Trevelyan : " I did hope you 'd land , like you have . Waved a large red flag at you , did n't I ? You see , I knew you must have less beef than my ship . Now I 've got you . " " What will you do with me ? " the Co-ordinator replied . " Well , uh , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vehement , " Murdoch said . " But I do n't see any point in killing you . I sure do n't want to . You 're not a bad osco , Mike , for a Cordy . And they ca n't have any idea on Earth which way we headed . I 'm not about to return there ; I 've done my credit arranging . If they ask me about youp103later on , why , I never had any notion you were trying to follow me . You must 've come to grief somehow , and I 'm awful sorry . Maybe I 'll use your boat to fake some clues . " His mask of bashfulness fell away . He beamed . " Tell you what , Mike , " he said . " Let 's find you a nice island out in mid-ocean . We 'll leave you tools and supplies and show you what 's safe to eat . You Cordys are supposed to be philosophers . You should be glad of a few years for thinking . If you want , I 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , I 'll flit you to our spaceport we'll 've built . How 's that for a fair proposition ? " Trevelyan savored the breath he drew , the light he saw , the will rising within him like a physical tide . " Let me be sure I understand you , " he said . " Do you seriously intend to maroon me in order that I wo n't report the facts of this case ? " " Too good for you , " Faustina said . " But if Juan 's that tenderspirited , yes . " " Do you realize that this involves grave violations of personal integrity ? " Trevelyan asked . " Do you realize that it involves direct interference with an officer of the Union in the performance of his duty ? " Murdoch flushed . " Obscenity your duty ! " " I demand you let me go back to my spacecraft and depart unmolested , " Trevelyan said . Faustina snickered . " You will not ? " Trevelyan asked . He waited . A breeze whispered . " Very well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brainphasing that you are guilty of attempted crimes sufficient to justify your arrest . Will you come quietly with me ? " " Have you lost your orbit ? " Murdoch exclaimed . " Since you resist arrest in addition , " Trevelyan said , " the necessity of applying force becomes incontestable . " The guards jabbered , swore , and brought their weapons to bear . Faustina hissed . Murdoch 's hand streaked to his own pistol . Trevelyan ostentatiously folded his arms and said : " If my Servicedoes not respect your rights , civilization is worthless . But civilizationhas rights of its own . I admit I led your thoughts away from my partner "  --  he heard a gasp and an oath  --  " but that scarcely constitutes entrapment . He 's under a roof in this city , on an accumulator/powered gray sled , along with several nuclear missiles . Through a miniradio in my pocket , he 's been listening to our conversation . If you do n't surrender yourselves , he 'll destroy you . " He paid scant attention to the uproar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Murdoch yanked a transceiver from his jacket to speak an order . " Give them a demonstration , Smokesmith , " Trevelyan said . No one saw the torpedo rise . It went too fast . Momentarily the sky was bedazzled with hell-colored flame . Concussion smote , not unduly hard from that altitude , but it shook men where they stood and bellowed in their ears . The bones before the temple shuddered . " A bit close , " Trevelyan said . He was aware that his own body quivered and went dry in the mouth . A remote part of him decided this was an unintegrate reaction and he needed more training . Speech and reasoning mind , though , were steel cool . " We may want antirad shots . I think you 'll agree , Juan , the next can drop right here . Afterwardmy Reardonite friend wo n't have trouble picking off your watchmen . " " You 'll be dead too , " Murdoch groaned . " I do n't want to be , " Trevelyan said , " but rather more is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around behind Murdoch . She snatched his gun from the holster , flung herself forward , and rammed the muzzle into Trevelyan 's belly . " Oof ! " he choked . I do n't exactly cut a heroic figure , do I ? flashed through him . But the beings here only had what dignity they could make for themselves , after heaven 's meaningless anger fell on them . " I 'll kill you myself ! " she raved . He knew tricks for knocking the weapon aside and taking it from her . But others were trained on him . He met her eyes , from which the tears went flooding , and said : " If you do , why should my partner not destroy you ? " Murdoch wrenched the gun from her . She raked at his face . He knocked her down . Panting , sweat a-river on his skin , he said : " What do you want ? " " If you know something about Reardonites , " Trevelyan said , and saw that Murdoch did , " you 'll realize it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he agrees it 's undesirable . So is the destruction of this beautiful plaza . Let 's compromise . "  | " I asked what do you want , you devil ? " " Safe conduct back to my vessel . Smokesmith will monitor me by radio . Your ship will stay put . At the first sign of any ill faith whatsoever , he shoots . At worst , you see , he must eliminate both ships and hope this world gets rediscovered by someone who 'll respect it . Once aloft , I 'll quickly drop down again and pick him up , too quickly for you to rise . At that point you 'll be helpless ; but have no fears . With a head start and a faster craft , I 'll be on the frontier planets before you , issuing prohibitions . No one 's going to follow you when he knows it 'll bring warships down on him .

" I 'll escort you to your boat personal . Here . " He offered his pistol . Trevelyan accepted it . Faustina sat up . A bruise was spreading on her slim jaw where her lover 's fist had smitten . She looked at them both , through tears and matted locks , and was no longer anything except a bewildered beaten child . " Why ? " she pleaded . " Why ca n't we have a patent  --  when w-wwefound the supernova for you ? You 'd do this  --  wreck everything for . . . two , three hundred s-s-specialists  --  and their curiosity ? " Trevelyan hunkered down before her . He took both her hands in one of his . The other pointed around , ending at the temple . " No , " he said most gently . " For these . Have they no rights ?

Without it , nothing would have meaning and it may be that nothing would survive . But the young generations so often do not understand.  |p106By  way of contrast to the foregoing , here is a story which on the one hand uses ancient motifs in the fantasy tradition , and on the other hand is strict science fiction in the sense of using no concept that the most conservative scientist could say is theoretically impossible . As a matter of fact , I do n't think anything in it is even technologically impossible . That scares me . HREE WOMEN : one is dead ; one is alive ; One is both and neither , and will never live and never die , being immortal in SUM . On a hill above that valley through which runs the highroad , I await Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasses have paled . Otherwise the slope is begrown with blackberry bushes that have been harvested by men and birds , leaving only briars , and with certain apple trees . They are very old , those trees , survivors of an orchard raised by generations which none but SUM now remembers ( I can see a few fragments of wall thrusting above the brambles )  --  scattered crazily over the hillside and as crazily gnarled . A little fruit remains on them . Chill across my skin , a gust shakes loose an apple . I hear it knock on the earth , another stroke of some eternal clock . The shrubs whisper to the wind . Elsewhere the ridges around me are wooded , afire with scarlets and brasses and bronzes . The sky is huge , the westering sun wanbright . The valley is filling with a deeper blue , a haze whose slight smokiness touches my nostrils . This is Indian summer , the funeral pyre of the year . There have been other seasons . There have been other lifetimes , before mine and hers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We still allow ourselves music , though , and I have spentp107much time planting melodies around my rediscovered words . " In the greenest growth of the Maytime  --  " I unsling the harp on my back , and tune it afresh , and sing to her , straight into autumn and the waningday. "  --  You came , and the sun came after , And the green grew golden above : And the flag-flowers lightened with laughter , And the meadowsweet shook with love . " A footfall stirs the grasses , quite gently , and the woman says , trying to chuckle , " Why , thank you . " Once , so soon after my one 's death that I was still dazed by it , I stood in the home that had been ours . This was on the hundred and first floor of a most desirable building . After dark the city flamed for us , blinked , glittered , flung immense sheets of radiance forth like banners . Nothing but SUM could have controlled the firefly dance of a million aircars among the towers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , from nuclear powerplants through automated factories , physical and economic distribution networks , sanitation , repair , services , education , culture , order , everything as one immune immortal organism . We had gloried in belonging to this as well as to each other . But that night I told the kitchen to throw the dinner it had made for me down the waste chute , and ground under my heel the chemical consolations which the medicine cabinet extended to me , and kicked the cleaner as it picked up the mess , and ordered the lights not to go on , anywhere in our suite . I stood by the vieWall , looking out across megalopolis , and it was tawdry . In my hands I had a little clay figure she had fashioned herself . I turned it over and over and over . But I had forgotten to forbid the door to admit visitors . It recognized this woman and opened for her . She had come with the kindly intention of teasing me out of a mood that seemed to her unnatural . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had almost the same height as my girl did , and her hair chanced to be bound in a way that my girl often favored , and the figurine dropped from my grasp and shattered , because for an instant I thought she was my girl . Since then I have been hard put not to hate Thrakia . This evening , even without so much sundown light , I wouldp108not make that mistake . Nothing but the silvery bracelet about her left wrist bespeaks the past we share . She is in wildcountry garb : boots , kilt of true fur and belt of true leather , knife at hip and rifle slung on shoulder . Her locks are matted and snarled , her skin brown from weeks of weather ; scratches and smudges show beneath the fantastic zigzags she has painted in many colors on herself . She wears a necklace of bird skulls . Now that one who is dead was , in her own way , more a child of trees and horizons than Thrakia 's followers . She was so much at home in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cleanliness , reason or gentleness , when we sickened of the cities and went forth beyond them . From this trait I got many of the names I bestowed on her , such as Wood 's Colt or Fallow Hind or , from my prowlings among ancient books , Dryad and Elven . ( She liked me to choose her names , and this pleasure had no end , because she was inexhaustible . ) I let my harpstring ring into silence . Turning about , I say to Thrakia , " I was n't singing for you . Not for anyone . Leave me alone . " She draws a breath . The wind ruffles her hair and brings me an odor of her : not female sweetness , but fear . She clenches her fists and says , " You 're crazy . " " Wherever did you find a meaningful word like that ? " I gibe ; for my own pain and  --  to be truthful  --  my own fear must strike out at something , and here she stands . " Are n't you content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got it from you , " she says defiantly , " you and your damned archaic songs . There 's another word , damned . ' And how it suits you ! When are you going to stop this morbidity ? " " And commit myself to a clinic and have my brain laundered nice and sanitary ? Not soon , darling . " I use that last word aforethought , but she can not know what scorn and sadness are in it for me , who know that once it could also have been a name for my girl . The official grammar and pronunciation of language is as frozen as every other aspect of our civilization , thanks to electronic recording and neuronic teaching ; but meanings shift and glide about like subtle serpents . ( O adder that stung my Foalfoot ! ) I shrug and say in my driest , most city-technological voice , " Actually , I 'm the practical , nonmorbid one . Instead of running away from my emotions  --  via drugs , or neuroadjustment , or playing atp109savagery like you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete plan for getting back the person who made me happy . " " By disturbing Her on Her way home ? " " Anyone has the right to petition the Dark Queen while She 's abroad on earth . " " But this is past the proper time  --  " " No law 's involved , just custom . People are afraid to meet Her outside a crowd , a town , bright flat lights . They wo n't admit it , but they are . So I came here precisely not to be part of a queue . I do n't want to speak into a recorder for subsequent computer analysis of my words . How could I be sure She was listening ? I want to meet Her as myself , a unique being , and look in Her eyes while I make my prayer . " Thrakia chokes a little . " She 'll be angry . " " Is She able to be angry , anymore ? " " I . . . I do n't know . What you mean to ask for is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you back your girl . You know It never makes exceptions . " " Is n't She Herself an exception ? " " That 's different . You 're being silly . SUM has to have a , well , a direct human liaison . Emotional and cultural feedback , as well as statistics . How else can It govern rationally ? And She must have been chosen out of the whole world . Your girl , what was she ? Nobody ! " " To me , she was everybody . " " You  --  " Thrakia catches her lip in her teeth . One hand reaches out and closes on my bare forearm , a hard hot touch , the grimy fingernailsbiting . When I make no response , she lets go and stares at the ground . A V of outbound geese passes overhead . Their cries come shrill through the wind , which is loudening in the forest . " Well , " she says , " you are special . You always were . You went to space and came back , with the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understands about the ancients . And your singing , yes , you do n't really entertain , your songs trouble people and ca n't be forgotten . So maybe She will listen to you . But SUM wo n't . It ca n't give special resurrections . Once that was done , a single time , would n't it have to be done for everybody ? The dead would overrun the living . " " Not necessarily , " I say . " In any event , 1 mean to try . "  | " Why ca n't you wait for the promised time ? Surely , then , SUM will re-create you two in the same generation . " " I 'd have to live out this life , at least , without her , " I say , looking away also , down to the highroad which shines through shadow like death 's snake , the length of the valley . " Besides , how do you know there ever will be any resurrections ? We have only a promise . No , less than that . An announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands as if to fend me off . Her soul bracelet casts light into my eyes . I recognize an embryo exorcism . She lacks ritual ; every " superstition " was patiently scrubbed out of our metal-and-energy world , long ago . But if she has no word for it , no concept , nevertheless she recoils from blasphemy . So I say , wearily , not wanting an argument , wanting only to wait here alone : " Never mind . There could be some natural catastrophe , like a giant asteroid striking , that wiped out the system before conditionshad become right for resurrections to commence . " " That 's impossible , " she says , almost frantic . " The hotneo ; tats , the repair functions  --  " " All right , call it a vanishingly unlikely theoretical contingency . Let 's declare that I 'm so selfish I want Swallow Wing back now , in this life of mine , and do n't give a curse whether that 'll be fair to the rest of you . " You wo n't care either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't grieve . It is your own precious private consciousnesses that you wish to preserve ; no one else is close enough to you to matter very much . Would you believe me if I told you I am quite prepared to offer SUM my own death in exchange for It releasing Blossom-in-the-Sun ? I do n't speak that thought , which would be cruel , nor repeat what is crueller : my fear that SUM lies , that the dead never will be disgorged . For ( I am not the All-Controller , I think not with vacuum and negative energy levels but with ordinary earth-begotten molecules ; yet I can reason somewhat dispassionately , being disillusioned ) considerThe object of the game is to maintain a society stable , just , and sane . This requires satisfaction not only of somatic , but of symbolic and instinctual needs . Thus children must be allowed to come into being . The minimum number per generation is equal to the maximum : that number which will maintain a constant population . It is also desirable to remove the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time as it is socially feasible , SUM will begin to refashion us , with our complete memories but in the pride of our youth . This can be done over and over , life after life across the millennia . So death is , indeed , a sleep.  --  in that sleep of death , what dreams may come  --  No . I myselfdare not dwell on this . I ask merely , privately : Just when and how does SUM expect conditions ( in a stabilized society , mind you ) to have become so different from today 's that the reborn can , in their millions , safely be welcomed back ? I see no reason why SUM should not lie to us . We , too , are objects in the world that It manipulates . " We 've quarreled about this before , Thrakia , " I sigh . " Often . Why do you bother ? " " I wish I knew , " she answers low . Half to herself , she goes on : " Of course I want to copulate with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to follow you about with her eyes , and smile when she touched your hand , and  --  But you ca n't be better than everyone else . That 's unreasonable . There are only so many possible ways . So why do I care if you wrap yourself up in silence and go off alone ? Is it that that makes you a challenge ? " " You think too much , " I say . " Even here . You 're a pretend primitive . You visit wildcountry to slake inborn atavistic impulses ' .. . but you ca n't dismantle that computer inside yourself and simply feel , simply be . " She bristles . I touched a nerve there . Looking past her , alongthe ridge of fiery maple and sumac , brassy elm and great dun oak , I see others emerge from beneath the trees . Women exclusively , herfollowers , as unkempt as she ; one has a brace of ducks lashed toher waist , and their blood has trickled down her thigh and dried black . For this movement , this unadmitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should forsake the easy routine and theeasy pleasure of the cities , and become again , for a few weeks eachyear , the carnivores who begot our species ; women too should seekout starkness , the better to appreciate civilization when they return . I feel a moment 's unease . We are in no park , with laid-out trailsand campground services . We are in wildcountry . Not many mencome here , ever , and still fewer women ; for the region is , literally , beyond the law . No deed done here is punishable . We are told thatthis helps consolidate society , as the most violent among us mayp112thus vent their passions . But I have spent much time in wildcountry since my Morning Star went out  --  myself in quest of nothing but solitude  --  andI have watched what happens through eyes that have also read anthropology and history . Institutions are developing ; ceremonies , tribalisms , acts of blood and cruelty and acts elsewhere called unnatural are becoming more elaborate and more expected every year . Then the practitioners go home to their cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise , and good tensionreleasingfun . Let her get angry enough and Thrakia can call knives to her aid . Wherefore I make myself lay both hands on her shoulders , and meet the tormented gaze , and say most gently , " I 'm sorry . I know you mean well . You 're afraid She will be annoyed and bring misfortuneon your people . " Thrakia gulps . " No , " she whispers . " That would n't be logical . But I 'm afraid of what might happen to you . And then  --  " Suddenly she throws herself against me . I feel arms , breasts , belly press through my tunic , and smell meadows in her hair and musk in her mouth . " You 'd be gone ! " she wails . " Then who 'd sing to us ? " " Why , the planet 's crawling with entertainers , " I stammer . " You 're more than that , " she says . " So much more . I do n't like what you sing , not really  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , meaningless , horrible !  --  but , I do n't know why , I want you to trouble me . " Awkward , I pat her back . The sun now stands very little above the treetops . Its rays slant interminably through the booming , frosting air . I shiver in my tunic and buskins and wonder what to do . A sound rescues me . It comes from one end of the valley below us , where further view is blocked off by two cliffs ; it thunders deep in our ears and rolls through the earth into our bones . We have heard that sound in the cities , and been glad to have walls and lights and multitudes around us . Now we are alone with it , the noise of Her chariot . The women shriek , I hear them faintly across wind and rumble and my own pulse , and they vanish into the woods . They will seek their camp , dress warmly , build enormous fires ; presently they will eat their ecstatics , and rumors are uneasy about what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul bracelet , and hauls . " Harper , come with me ! " she pleads . I break loose from her and stride down the hill toward the road . A scream follows me for a moment . Light still dwells in the sky and on the ridges , but as I descend into that narrow valley I enter dusk , and it thickens . Indistinct bramblebusheswhicker where I brush them , and claw back at me . I feel the occasional scratch on my legs , the tug as my garment is snagged , the chill that I breathe , but dimly . My perceived-outer-reality is overpoweredby the rushing of Her chariot and my blood . My inneruniverseis fear , yes , but exaltation too , a drunkenness which sharpens instead of dulling the senses , a psychedelia which opens the reasoning mind as well as the emotions ; I have gone beyond myself , I am embodied purpose . Not out of need for comfort , but to voice what Is , I return to words whose speaker rests centuries dust , and lend them my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , and the world 's golden , And one peak tipped with light ; And the air lies still about the hillWith the first fear of night ; Till mystery down the soundless valley Thunders , and dark is here ; And the wind blows , and the light goes , And the night is full of fear . And I know one night , on some far height , In the tongue I never knew , I yet shall hear the tidings clearFrom them that were friends of you . They 'll call the news from hill to hill , Dark and uncomforted , Earth and sky and the winds ; and IShall know that you are dead .  --  " But I have reached the valley floor , and She has come in sight . Her chariot is unlit , for radar eyes and inertial guides need nolamps , nor sun nor stars . Wheel-less , the steel tear rides on itsp114own roar and thrust of air . The pace is not great , far less than any of our mortals ' vehicles are wont to take . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that She may perceive with Her own senses and so be the better prepared to counsel SUM . But now Her annual round is finished ; She is homeward bound ; until spring She will dwell with It Which is our lord . Why does She not hasten tonight ? Because Death has never a need of haste ? I wonder . And as I step into the middle of the road , certain lines from the yet more ancient past rise tremendous within me , and I strike my harp and chant them louder than the approaching car : " I that in heill was and gladness Am trublit now with great sickness And feblit with infirmitie : Timor mortis conturbat me . " The car detects me and howls a warning . I hold my ground . The car could swing around , the road is wide and in any event a smooth surface is not absolutely necessary . But I hope , I believe that She will be aware of an obstacle in Her path , and tune in Her various amplifiers , and find me abnormal enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  who , even among the explorers that It has sent beyond in Its unappeasable hunger for data  --  would stand in a cold wildcountry dusk and shout while his harp snarls " Our pleasance here is all vain glory , This fals world is but transitory , The flesh is bruckle , the Feynd is slee :  --  Timor mortis conturbat me . The state of man does change and vary , Now sound , now sick , now blyth , now sary , Now dansand mirry , now like to die : Timor mortis conturbat me . No state in Erd here standis sicker ; As with the wynd wavis the wicker So wannis this world 's vanitie : Timor mortis conturbat me.  --  ? "  |p115The  car draws alongside and sinks to the ground . I let my strings die away into the wind . The sky overhead and in the west is graypurple ; eastward it is quite dark and a few early stars peer forth . Here , down in the valley , shadows are heavy and I can not see very well . The canopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus looming over me . Her robe and cloak are black , fluttering like restlesswings ; beneath the cowl Her face is a white blur . I have seen it before , under full light , and in how many thousands of pictures ; but at this hour I can not call it back to my mind , not entirely . I list sharpsculpturedprofile and pale lips , sable hair and long green eyes , but these are nothing more than words . " What are you doing ? " She has a lovely low voice ; but is it , as oh , how rarely since SUM took Her to Itself , is it the least shaken ? " What is that you were singing ? " My answer comes so strong that my skull resonates ; for I am borne higher and higher on my tide . " Lady of Ours , I have a peti-tion . " " Why did you not bring it before Me when I walked among men ? Tonight I am homebound . You must wait till I ride forth with the new year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would wish living ears to hear what I have to say . " She regards me for a long while . Do I indeed sense fear also in Her ? ( Surely not of me . Her chariot is armed and armored , and would react with machine speed to protect Her should I offer violence . And should I somehow , incredibly , kill Her , or wound Her beyond chemosurgical repair , She of all beings has no need to doubt death . The ordinary bracelet cries with quite sufficient radio loudnessto be heard by more than one thanatic station , when we die ; and in that shielding the soul can scarcely be damaged before the Winged Heels arrive to bear it off to SUM . Surely the Dark Queen 's circlet can call still further , and is still better insulated , than any mortal 's . And She will most absolutely be re-created . She has been , again and again ; death and rebirth every seven years keep Her eternally young in the service of SUM . I have never been able to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , of what I have sung and what I might speak ? At last She says  --  I can scarcely hear through the gusts and creakingsin the trees  --  " Give me the Ring , then . "  |p116The  dwarf robot which stands by Her throne when She sits among men appears beside Her and extends the massive dull-silver circle to me . I place my left arm within , so that my soul is enclosed . The tablet on the upper surface of the Ring , which looks so much like a jewel , slants away from me ; I can not read what flashes onto the bezel . But the faint glow picks Her features out of murk as She bends to look . Of course , I tell myself , the actual soul is not scanned . That would take too long . Probably the bracelet which contains the soul has an identification code built in . The Ring sends this to an appropriatepart of SUM , Which instantly sends back what is recorded under that code . I hope there is nothing more to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you call yourself at the moment ? " She asks . A current of bitterness crosses my tide . " Lady of Ours , why should You care ? Is not my real name the number I got when I was allowed to be born ? " Calm descends once more upon Her . " If I am to evaluate properlywhat you say , I must know more about you than these few official data . Name indicates mood . " I too feel unshaken again , my tide running so strong and smooth that I might not know I was moving did I not see time recede behind me . " Lady of Ours , I can not give You a fair answer . In this past year I have not troubled with names , or with much of anything else . But some people who knew me from earlier days call me Harper . " " What do you do besides make that sinister music ? " " These days , nothing , Lady of Ours . I 've money to live out my life , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am fed and housed for the sake of my songs . " " What you sang is unlike anything I have heard since  --  " Anew , briefly , that robot serenity is shaken . " Since before the world was stabilized . You should not wake dead symbols , Harper . They walk through men 's dreams . " " Is that bad ? " " Yes . The dreams become nightmares . Remember : Mankind , every man who ever lived , was insane before SUM brought order , reason , and peace . " " Well , then , " I say , " I will cease and desist if I may have my own dead wakened for me. "  |p117She  stiffens . The tablet goes out . I withdraw my arm and the Ring is stored away by Her servant . So again She is faceless , beneath flickering stars , here at the bottom of this shadowed valley . Her voice falls cold as the air : " No one can be brought back to life before ResurrectionTime is ripe . " I do not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be vicious . What did She think , how did She weep , when SUM chose Her of all the young on earth ? What does She endure in Her centuries ? I dare not imagine . Instead , I smite my harp and sing , quietly this time : " Strew on her roses , roses , And never a spray of yew . In quiet she reposes : Ah ! would that I did too . " The Dark Queen cries , " What are you doing ? Are you really insane ? " I go straight to the last stanza . " Her cabin 'd , ample SpiritIt flutter 'd and fail 'd for breath . To-night it doth inheritThe vasty hall of Death . " I know why my songs strike so hard : because they bear dreads and passions that no one is used to  --  that most of us hardly know could exist  --  in SUM 's ordered universe . But I had not the courage to hope She would be as torn by them as I see . Has She not lived with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She calls , " Who has died ? " " She had many names , Lady of Ours , " I say . " None was beautifulenough . I can tell You her number , though . " " Your daughter ? I . . . sometimes I am asked if a dead child can not be brought back . Not often , anymore , when they go so soon to the creche . But sometimes . I tell the mother she may have a new one ; but if ever We started re-creating dead infants , at what age level could We stop ? " " No , this was my woman . " " Impossible ! " Her tone seeks to be not unkindly but is , instead ,  |p118well-nigh  frantic . " You will have no trouble finding others . You are handsome , and your psyche is , is , is extraordinary . It burns like Lu-cifer . " " Do You remember the name Lucifer , Lady of Ours ? " I pounce . " Then You are old indeed . So old that You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but her above the whole world and heaven . " She tries to defend Herself with a jeer : " Was that mutual , Harper ? I know more of mankind than you do , and surely I am the last chaste woman in existence . " " Now that she is gone , Lady , yes , perhaps You are . But we  --  Do You know how she died ? We had gone to a wildcountry area . A man saw her , alone , while I was off hunting gem rocks to make her a necklace . He approached her . She refused him . He threatened force . She fled . This was desert land , viper land , and she was barefoot . One of them bit her . I did not find her till hours later . By then the poison and the unshaded sun  --  She died quite soon after she told me what had happened and that she loved me . I could not get her body to chemosurgery in time for normal revival procedures . I had to let them cremate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What right have you to demand her back , when no one else can be given their own ? " " The right that I love her , and she loves me . We are more necessary to each other than sun or moon . I do not think You could find another two people of whom this is so , Lady . And is not everyone entitled to claim what is necessary to his life ? How else can society be kept whole ? " " You are being fantastic , " She says thinly . " Let me go . " " No , Lady , I am speaking sober truth . But poor plain words wo n't serve me . I sing to You because then maybe You will understand . " And I strike my harp anew ; but it is more to her than Her that I sing . " If I had thought thou couldst have died , I might not weep for thee : But I forgot , when by thy side , That thou couldst mortal be : It never through my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I on thee should look my last , And thou shouldst smile no more ! " " I can not  --  " She falters . " I did not know  --  any such feelings  --  so strong  --  existed any longer . " " Now You do , Lady of Ours . And is that not an important datum for SUM ? " " Yes . If true . " Abruptly She leans toward me . I see Her shudderin the murk , under the flapping cloak , and hear Her jaws clatter with cold . " I can not linger here . But ride with Me . Sing to Me . I think I can bear it . " So much have I scarcely expected . But my destiny is upon me . I mount into the chariot . The canopy slides shut and we proceed . The main cabin encloses us . Behind its rear door must be facilitiesfor Her living on earth ; this is a big vehicle . But here is little except curved panels . They are true wood of different comely grains : so She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She ? Furnishing is scant and austere . The only sound is our passage , mu ii ed to a murmur for us ; and , because their photomultipliers are not activated , the scanners show nothing outside but night . We huddleclose to a glower , hands extended toward its fieriness . Our shouldersbrush , our bare arms , Her skin is soft and Her hair falls loose over the thrown-back cowl , smelling of the summer which is dead . What , is She still human ? After a timeless time , She says , not yet looking at me : " The thing you sang , there on the highroad as I came near  --  I do not remember it . Not even from the years before I became what I am . " " It is older than SUM , " I answer , " and its truth will outlive It . " " Truth ? " I see Her tense Herself . " Sing Me the rest . " My fingers are no longer too numb to call forth chords.

He takis the tampion in the stour , The captain closit in the tour , The lathe in bour full of bewtie :  --  " ( There I must stop a moment . ) " Timor mortis conturbat me . He spans no lord for his piscence , Na clerk for his intelligence ; His awful straik may no man flee :  --  Timor mortis conturbat me . " She breaks me off , clapping hands to ears and half shrieking , " No ! " I , grown unmerciful , pursue Her : " You understand now , do You not ? You are not eternal either . SUM is n't . Not Earth , not sun , not stars . We hid from the truth . Every one of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made everything make sense . Then I had nothing left to lose , and could look with clear eyes . And what I saw was Death . " " Get out ! Let Me alone ! " " I will not let the whole world alone , Queen , until I get her back . Give me her again , and I 'll believe in SUM again . I 'll praise It till men dance for joy to hear Its name . " She challenges me with wildcat eyes . " Do you think such mattersto It ? " " Well , " I shrug , " songs could be useful . They could help achieve the great objective sooner . Whatever that is . Optimization of total human activity '  --  was n't that the program ? I do n't know if it still is . SUM has been adding to Itself so long . I doubt if You Yourself understandIts purposes , Lady of Ours . " " Do n't speak as if It were alive , " She says harshly . " It is a computer-effector complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " I  --  yes . It thinks , more widely and deeply than any human ever did or could ; but It is not alive , not aware , It has no consciousness . That is one reason why It decided It needed Me . " " Be that as it may , Lady , " I tell Her , " the ultimate result , whateverIt finally does with us , lies far in the future . At present I care about that ; I worry ; I resent our loss of self-determination . But that 's because only such abstractions are left to me . Give me back my Lightfoot , and she , not the distant future , will be my concern . I 'll be grateful , honestly grateful , and You Two will know it from the songs I then choose to sing . Which , as I said , might be helpful to It . " " You are unbelievably insolent , " She says without force . " No , Lady , just desperate , " I say . The ghost of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooded , and murmurs , " Well , I 'll take you there . What happens then , you realize , lies outside My power . My observations , My recommendations , are nothing but a few items to take into account , among billions . However . . . we have a long way to travel this night . Give me what data you think will help you , Harper . " I do not finish the Lament . Nor do I dwell in any other fashion on grief . Instead , as the hours pass , I call upon those who dealt with the joy ( not the fun , not the short delirium , but the joy ) that man and woman might once have of each other . Knowing where we are bound , I too need such comfort . And the night deepens , and the leagues fall behind us , and finallywe are beyond habitation , beyond wildcountry , in the land where life never comes . By crooked moon and waning starlight I see the plain of concrete and iron , the missiles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloft : and the lines , the relay towers , the scuttling beetle-shaped carriers , that whole transcendent nerve-blood-sinew by which SUM knows and orders the world . For all the flitting about , for all the forces which seethe , here is altogether still . The wind itself seems to have frozen to death . Hoarfrost is gray on the steel shapes . Ahead of us , tiered and mountainous , begins to appear the castle of SUM . She Who rides with me does not give sign of noticing that my songs have died in my throat . What humanness She showed is departing ; Her face is cold and shut , Her voice bears a ring of metal . She looks straight ahead . But She does speak to me for a little while yet :  | " Do you understand what is going to happen ? For the next half year I will be linked with SUM , integral , another component of It . I suppose you will see Me , but that will merely be My flesh . What speaks to you will be SUM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced forth . My coming this far is more triumph than any man in creation before me has won ; and I am here to do battle for my Dancer-on-Moonglades ; but nonethelessmy heart shakes me , and is loud in my skull , and my sweat stinks . I manage , though , to add : " You will be a part of It , Lady of Ours . That gives me hope . " For an instant She turns to me , and lays Her hand across mine , and something makes Her again so young and untaken that I almost forget the girl who died ; and she whispers , " If you knew how I hope ! " The instant is gone , and I am alone among machines . We must stop before the castle gate . The wall looms sheer above , so high and high that it seems to be toppling upon me against the westward march of the stars , so black and black that it does not only drink down every light , it radiates blindness . Challenge and response quiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of It have perceived a mortal aboard this craft . A missilelauncher swings about to aim its three serpents at me . But the Dark Queen answers  --  She does not trouble to be peremptory  --  and the castle opens its jaws for us . We descend . Once , I think , we cross a river . I hear a rushing and hollow echoing and see droplets glitter where they are cast onto the viewports and outlined against dark . They vanish at once : liquid hydrogen , perhaps , to keep certain parts near absolute zero ? Much later we stop and the canopy slides back . I rise with Her . We are in a room , or cavern , of which I can see nothing , for there is no light except a dull bluish phosphorescence which streams from every solid object , also from Her flesh and mine . But I judge the chamber is enormous , for a sound of great machines at work comes very remotely , as if heard through dream , while our own voices are swallowed up by distance . Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without odor , a dead wind . We descend to the floor . She stands before me , hands crossed on breast , eyes half shut beneath the cowl and not looking at me nor away from me . " Do what you are told , Harper , " She says in a voice that has never an overtone , " precisely as you are told . " She turns andp123departs at an even pace . I watch Her go until I can no longer tell Her luminosity from the formless swirlings within my own eyeballs . A claw plucks my tunic . I look down and am surprised to see that the dwarf robot has been waiting for me this whole time . How long a time that was , I can not tell . Its squat form leads me in another direction . Weariness crawls upward through me , my feet stumble , my lips tingle , lids are weighted and muscles have each their separate aches . Now and then I feel a jag of fear , but dully . When the robot indicates Lie down here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I let various wires be attached to me , variousneedles be injected which lead into tubes . I pay little attention to the machines which cluster and murmur around me . The robot goes away . I sink into blessed darkness . I wake renewed in body . A kind of shell seems to have grown between my forebrain and the old animal parts . Far away I can feel the horror and hear the screaming and thrashing of my instincts ; but awareness is chill , calm , logical . I have also a feeling that I slept for weeks , months , while leaves blew loose and snow fell on the upper world . But this may be wrong , and in no case does it matter . I am about to be judged by SUM . The little faceless robot leads me off , through murmurous black corridors where the dead wind blows . I unsling my harp and clutch it to me , my sole friend and weapon . So the tranquillity of the reasoningmind which has been decreed for me can not be absolute . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by anguish . ( No ; wrong ; nothing so humanlike ; It has no desires ; beneath that power to reason is nullity . ) At length a wall opens for us and we enter a room where She sits enthroned . The self-radiation of metal and flesh is not apparent here , for light is provided , a featureless white radiance with no apparentsource . White , too , is the muted sound of the machines which encompass Her throne . White are Her robe and face . I look away from the multitudinous unwinking scanner eyes , into Hers , but She does not appear to recognize me . Does She even see me ? SUM has reached out with invisible fingers of electromagnetic induction and taken Her back into Itself . I do not tremble or sweat  --  I can not  --  but I square my shoulders , strike one plangent chord , and wait for It to speak.  |p124It  does , from some invisible place . I recognize the voice It has chosen to use : my own . The overtones , the inflections are true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one reasonable man to another . Why not ? In computing what to do about me , and in programmingItself accordingly , SUM must have used so many billion bits of information that adequate accent is a negligible sub-problem . No . . . there I am mistaken again . . . SUM does not do things on the basis that It might as well do them as not . This talk with myself is intended to have some effect on me . I do not know what . " Well , " It says pleasantly , " you made quite a journey , did n't you ? I 'm glad . Welcome . " My instincts bare teeth to hear those words of humanity used by the unfeeling unalive . My logical mind considers replying with an ironic " Thank you , " decides against it , and holds me silent . " You see , " SUM continues after a moment that whirrs , " you are unique . Pardon Me if I speak a little bluntly . Your sexual monomania is just one aspect of a generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary misfit , you 're both strong and realistic enough to cope with the world . This chance to meet you , to analyze you while you rested , has opened new insights for Me on human psychophysiology . Which may lead to improved techniques for governing it and its evolution . " " That being so , " I reply , " give me my reward . " " Now look here , " SUM says in a mild tone , " you if anyone should know I 'm not omnipotent . I was built originally to help govern a civilization grown too complex . Gradually , as My program of selfexpansionprogressed , I took over more and more decision-making functions . They were given to Me . People were happy to be relieved of responsibility , and they could see for themselves how much better I was running things than any mortal could . But to this day , My authoritydepends on a substantial consensus . If I started playing favorites , as by re-creating your girl , well , I 'd have troubles . " " The consensus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " You have n't abolished the gods , You 've simply absorbed them into Yourself . If You choose to pass a miracle for me , your prophet singer  --  and I will be Your prophet if You do this  --  why , that strengthens the faith of the rest . " " So you think . But your opinions are n't based on any exact data . The historical and anthropological records from the past beforep125Me are unquantitative . I 've already phased them out of the curriculum . Eventually , when the culture 's ready for such a move , I 'll order them destroyed . They 're too misleading . Look what they 've done to you . " I grin into the scanner eyes . " Instead , " I say , " people will be encouraged to think that before the world was , was SUM . All right . I do n't care , as long as I get my girl back . Pass me a miracle , SUM , and I 'll guarantee You a good payment . " " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how the soul works . The metal bracelet encloses a pseudo-virus , a set of giant protein molecules with taps directly to the bloodstream and nervous system . They record the chromosome pattern , the synapse flash , the permanent changes , everything . At the owner 's death , the bracelet is dissected out . The Winged Heels bring it here , and the information contained is transferred to one of My memory banks . I can use such a record to guide the growing of a new body in the vats : a young body , on which the former habits and recollections are imprinted . But you do n't understand the complexity of the process , Harper . It takes Me weeks , every seven years , and every available biochemical facility , to re-create My human liaison . And the process is n't perfect , either . The pattern is affected by storage . You might say that this body and brain you see before you remembers each death . And those are short deaths . A longer one  --  man , use your sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason and feeling begins to crack . I had sung , of my darling dead , " No motion has she now , no force ; She neither hears nor sees ; Roll 'd round in earth 's diurnal course , With rocks , and stones , and trees . " Peace , at least . But if the memory-storage is not permanent but circulating ; if , within those gloomy caverns of tubes and wire and outerspacecold , some remnant of her psyche must flit and flicker , alone , unremembering , aware of nothing but having lost life  --  No ! I smite the harp and shout so the room rings : " Give her back ! Or I 'll kill you ! " SUM finds it expedient to chuckle ; and , horribly , the smile is reflected for a moment on the Dark Queen 's lips , though otherwisep126She never stirs . " And how do you propose to do that ? " It asks me . It knows , I know , what I have in mind , so I counter : " How do You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll . be considered a nuisance . Finally someone will decide you ought to have psychiatric treatment . They 'll query My diagnostic outlet . I 'll recommend certain excisions . " " On the other hand , since You 've sifted my mind by now , and since You know how I 've affected people with my songs  --  even the Lady yonder , even Her  --  would n't you rather have me working for You ? With words like , 0 taste , and see , how gracious the Lord is ; blessed is the man that trusteth in him . 0 fear the Lord , ye that are his saints : for they that fear him lack nothing . ' I can make You into God . " " In a sense , I already am God . " " And in another sense not . Not yet . " I can endure no more . " Why are we arguing ? You made Your decision before I woke . Tell me and let me go ! " With an odd carefulness , SUM responds : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , My knowledge of the human psyche is as yet imperfect . Certain areas wo n't yield to computation . I do n't know precisely what you 'd do , Harper . If to that uncertainty I added a potentially dangerous precedent  --  " " Kill me , then . " Let my ghost wander forever with hers , down in Your cryogenic dreams . " No , that 's also inexpedient . You 've made yourself too conspicuousand controversial . Too many people know by now that you went off with the Lady . " Is it possible that , behind steel and energy , a nonexistent hand brushes across a shadow face in puzzlement ? My heartbeat is thick in the silence . Suddenly It shakes me with decision : " The calculated probabilitiesdo favor your keeping your promises and making yourself useful . Therefore I shall grant your request . However  --  " I am on my knees . My forehead knocks on the floor until blood runs into my eyes . I hear through storm winds : "  --  testing must continue . Your faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're very skeptical of what you call My goodness . Without additional proof of your willingness to trust Me , I ca n't let you have the kind of importance which your getting your dead back from Me would give you . Do you understand ? "  |p127The  question does not sound rhetorical . " Yes , " I sob . " Well , then , " says my civilized , almost amiable voice , " I computedthat you 'd react much as you have done , and prepared for the likelihood . Your woman 's body was re-created while you lay under study . The data which make personality are now being fed back into her neurones . She 'll be ready to leave this place by the time you do . " I repeat , though , there has to be a testing . The procedure is also necessary for its effect on you . If you 're to be My prophet , you 'll have to work pretty closely with Me ; you 'll have to undergo a great deal of reconditioning ; this night we begin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , yes , what must I do ? " " Only this : Follow the robot out . At some point , she , your woman , will join you . She 'll be conditioned to walk so quietly you ca n't hear her . Do n't look back . Not once , until you 're in the upper world . A single glance behind you will be an act of rebellion against Me , and a datum indicating you ca n't really be trusted . . . and that ends everything . Do you understand ? " " Is that all ? " I cry . " Nothing more ? " " It will prove more difficult than you think , " SUM tells me . My voice fades , as if into illimitable distances : " Farewell , worshiper . " The robot raises me to my feet . I stretch out my arms to the Dark Queen . Half blinded with tears , I nonetheless see that She does not see me . " Good-bye , " I mumble , and let the robot lead me away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first I am in too much of a turmoil , and later too stunned , to know where or how we are bound . But later still , slowly , I become aware of my flesh and clothes and the robot 's alloy , glimmering blue in blackness . Sounds and smells are muffled ; rarely does another machine pass by , unheeding of us . ( What work does SUM have for them ? ) I am so careful not to look behind me that my neck grows stiff . Though it is not prohibited , is it , to lift my harp past my shoulder , in the course of strumming a few melodies to keep up my courage , and see if perchance a following illumination is reflected in this polished wood ? Nothing . Well , her second birth must take time  --  O SUM , be careful of her !  --  and then she must be led through many tunnels , no doubt , before she makes rendezvous with my back . Be patient , Harper.  |p128Sing  . Welcome her home . No , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet in that trance of death from which only the sun and my kiss can wake her ; if , indeed , she has joined me yet . I listen for other footfalls than my own . Surely we have n't much farther to go . I ask the robot , but of course I get no reply . Make an estimate . I know about how fast the chariot traveled coming down . . . . The trouble is , time does not exist here . I have no day , no stars , no clock but my heartbeat and I have lost the count of that . Nevertheless , we must come to the end soon . What purpose would be served by walking me through this labyrinth till I die ? Well , if I am totally exhausted at the outer gate , I wo n't make undue trouble when I find no Rose-in-Hand behind me . No , now that 's ridiculous . If SUM did n't want to heed my plea , It need merely say so . I have no power to inflict physical damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for me . It did speak of reconditioning . A series of shocks , culminating in that last one , could make me ready for whatever kind of gelding It intends to do . Or It might have changed Its mind . Why not ? It was quite frank about an uncertainty factor in the human psyche . It may have reevaluatedthe probabilities and decided : better not to serve my desire . Or It may have tried , and failed . It admitted the recording processis imperfect . I must not expect quite the Gladness I knew ; she will always be a little haunted . At best . But suppose the tank spawned a body with no awareness behind the eyes ? Or a monster ? Suppose , at this instant , I am being followed by a half-rotten corpse ? No ! Stop that ! SUM would know , and take corrective measures . Would It ? Can It ? I comprehend how this passage through night , where I never look to see what follows me , how this is an act of submission and confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that SUM is all-powerful , all-wise , all-good . To SUM I offer the love I came to win back . Oh , It looked more deeply into me than ever I did myself . But I shall not fail . Will SUM , though ? If there has indeed been some grisly error . . . let me not find it out under the sky . Let her , my only , not . For what then shall we do ? Could I lead her here again , knock on the iron gate , and cry , " Master , You have given me a thing unfit to exist . De/stroy it and start over . "  --  ? For what might the wrongness be ? Somethingso subtle , so pervasive , that it does not show in any way save my slow , resisted discovery that I embrace a zombie ? Does n't it make better sense to look  --  make certain while she is yet drowsy with death  --  use the whole power of SUM to correct what may be awry ? No , SUM wants me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that price . And to much else . . . I do n't know how much else , I am daunted to imagine , but that word " recondition " is ugly . . . . Does not my woman have some rights in the matter too ? Shall we not at least ask her if she wants to be the wife of a prophet ; shall we not , hand in hand , ask SUM what the price of her life is to her ? Was that a footfall ? Almost , I whirl about . I check myself and stand shaking ; names of hers break from my lips . The robot urges me on . Imagination . It was n't her step . I am alone . I will always be alone . The halls wind upward . Or so I think ; I have grown too weary for much kinesthetic sense . We cross the sounding river and I am bitten to the bone by the cold which blows upward around the bridge , and I may not turn about to offer the naked newborn woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do meaninglessthings . She has n't seen them before . Into what nightmare has she risen ; and why do n't I , who wept into her dying senses that I loved her , why do n't I look at her , why do n't I speak ? Well , I could talk to her . I could assure the puzzled mute dead that I have come to lead her back into sunlight . Could I not ? I ask the robot . It does not reply . I can not remember if I may speak to her . If indeed I was ever told . I stumble forward . I crash into a wall and fall bruised . The robot 's claw closes on my shoulder . Another arm gestures . I see a passageway , very long and narrow , through the stone . I will have to crawl through . At the end , at the end , the door is swinging wide . The dear real dusk of Earth pours through into this darkness . I am blinded and deafened . Do I hear her cry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sick , shaken mind betraying me ; or is there a destiny which , like SUM with us , makes tools of suns and SUM ? I do n't know . I know only that I turned , and there she stood . Her hair flowed long , loose , past the remembered face from which the trance was just departing , on which the knowing and the love of me had just awakened  --  flowedp130down over the body that reached forth arms , that took one step to meet me and was halted . The great grim robot at her own back takes her to it . I think it sends lightning through her brain . She falls . It bears her away . My guide ignores my screaming . Irresistible , it thrusts me out through the tunnel . The door clangs in my face . I stand before the wall which is like a mountain . Dry snow hisses across concrete . The sky is bloody with dawn ; stars still gleam in the west , and arc lights are scattered over the twilit plain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm . What is there left to have feelings about ? The door is iron , the wall is stone fused into one basaltic mass . I walk some distance off into the wind , turn around , lower my head , and charge . Let my brains be smeared across Its gate ; the pattern will be my hieroglyphic for hatred . I am seized from behind . The force that stops me must needs be bruisingly great . Released , I crumple to the ground before a machinewith talons and wings . My voice from it says , " Not here . I 'll carry you to a safe place . " " What more can You do to me ? " I croak . " Release you . You wo n't be restrained or molested on any ordersof Mine . " " Why not ? " " Obviously you 're going to appoint yourself My enemy forever .

" " You wo n't give her again ? You do n't want my love ? " " Not under the circumstances . Too uncontrollable . But your hatred should , as I say , be a useful experimental tool . " " I 'll destroy You , " I say . It does not deign to speak further . Its machine picks me up and flies off with me . I am left on the fringes of a small town farther south . Then I go insane . I do not much know what happens during that winter , nor care . The blizzards are too loud in my head . I walk the ways of Earth , among lordly towers , under neatly groomed trees , into careful gardens , over bland , bland campuses . I am unwashed , uncombed , unbarbered ; my tatters flap about me and my bones are near thrustingp131through the skin ; folk do not like to meet these eyes sunken so far into this skull , and perhaps for that reason they give me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hag and hungry goblinThat into rags would rend yeAnd the spirit that Stan ' by the naked man In the Book of Moons defend ye !

So I am often driven away with curses , and sometimes I must flee those who would arrest me and scrub my brain smooth . An alley is a good hiding place , if I can find one in the oldest part of a city ; I crouch there and yowl with the cats . A forest is also good . My pursuers dislike to enter any place where any wildness lingers . But some feel otherwise . They have visited parklands , preserves , actual wildcountry . Their purpose was overconscious  --  measured , planned savagery , and a clock to tell them when they must go home  --  but at least they are not afraid of silences and unlighted nights . As spring returns , certain among them begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But slowly , month by month , especially among the younger ones , my madness begins to call to something in them .

By a knight of ghosts and shadowsI summoned am to tourneyTen leagues beyond the wide world 's edge . Me thinks it is no journey . " They sit at my feet and listen to me sing . They dance , crazily , to my harp . The girls bend close , tell me how I fascinate them , inviteme to copulate . This I refuse , and when I tell them why they arep132puzzled , a little frightened maybe , but often they strive to understand . For my rationality is renewed with the hawthorn blossoms . I bathe , have my hair and beard shorn , find clean raiment , and take care to eat what my body needs .

We have buried such questions ; we have sworn they are dead  --  that they never really existed , being devoid of empirical meaning  --  and we have dreaded that they might raise the stones we heaped on them , rise and walk the world again of nights . Alone , I summon them to me . They can not hurt their fellowdead , among whom I now number myself . I sing to her who is gone . The young people hear and wonder . Sometimes they weep . " Fear no more the heat o ' the sun , Nor the furious winter 's rages ; Thou thy worldly task hast done , Home art gone , and ta'en thy wages : Golden lads and girls all mustAs chimney-sweepers , come to dust . " " But this is not so ! " they protest . " We will die and sleep awhile , and then we will live forever in SUM . " I answer as gently as may be : " No . Remember I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And even if you were right , it would not be right that you should be right . " " What ? " " Do n't you see , it is not right that a thing should be the lord of man . It is not right that we should huddle through our whole lives in fear of finally losing them . You are not parts in a machine , and you have better ends than helping the machine run smoothly . " I dismiss them and stride off , solitary again , into a canyon where a river clangs , or onto some gaunt mountain peak . No revelationis given me . I climb and creep toward the truth . Which is that SUM must be destroyed , not in revenge , not in hate , not in fear , simply because the human spirit can not exist in the same reality as It.  |p133But  what , then , is our proper reality ? And how shall we attain to it ? I return with my songs to the lowlands . Word about me has gone widely . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed into a street . " The Dark Queen will soon come to these parts , " they tell me . " Abide till She does . Let Her answer those questions you put to us , which make us sleep so badly . " " Let me retire to prepare myself , " I say . I go up a long flight of steps . The people watch from below , dumb with awe , till I vanish . Such few as were in the building depart . I walk down vaulted halls , through hushed high-ceilinged rooms full of tables , among shelves made massive by books . Sunlight slants dusty through the windows . The half memory has plagued me of late : once before , I know not when , this year of mine also took place . Perhaps in this library I can find the tale that  --  casually , I suppose , in my abnormal childhood  --  I read . For man is older than SUM : wiser , I swear ; his myths hold more truth than Its mathematics . I spend three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is scant sound but the rustling of leaves between my hands . Folk place offerings of food and drink at the door . They tell themselves they do so out of pity , or curiosity , or to avoid the nuisance of having me die in an unconventional fashion . But I know better . At the end of the three days I am little further along . I have too much material ; I keep going off on sidetracks of beauty and fascination . ( Which SUM means to eliminate . ) My education was like everyone else 's , science , rationality , good sane adjustment . ( SUM writes our curricula , and the teaching machines have direct connectionsto It . ) Well , I can make some of my lopsided training work for me . My reading has given me sufficient clues to prepare a search program . I sit down before an information retrieval console and run my fingers across its keys . They make a clattery music . Electron beams are swift hounds . Within seconds the screen lights up with words , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a fast reader . Before I can press the Clear button , the unreeling words are wiped out . For an instant the screen quivers with formlessness , then appearsI HAD NOT CORRELATED THESE DATA WITH THE FACTS CONCERN/ING YOU . THIS INTRODUCES A NEW AND INDETERMINATE QUANTITY INTO THE COMPUTATIONS . The nirvana which has come upon me ( yes , I found that word among the old books , and how portentous it is ) is not passiveness , it is a tide more full and strong than that which bore me down to the Dark Queen those ages apast in wildcountry . I say , as coolly as may be , " An interesting coincidence . If it is a coincidence . " Surely sonic receptors are emplaced hereabouts . EITHER THAT , OR A CERTAIN NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE LOGIC OF EVENTS . The vision dawning within me is so blinding bright that I can not refrain from answering , " Or a destiny , SUM ? " MEANINGLESS . MEANINGLESS . MEANINGLESS . " Now why did You repeat Yourself in that way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incantation . Are You by any chance hoping Your words will make me stop existing ? " I DO NOT HOPE . YOU ARE AN EXPERIMENT . IF I COMPUTE A SIGNIFICANTPROBABILITY OF YOUR CAUSING SERIOUS DISTURBANCE , I WILL HAVE YOU TERMINATED . I smile . " SUM , " I say , " I am going to terminate You . " I lean over and switch off the screen . I walk out into the evening . Not everything is clear to me yet , that I must say and do . But enough is that I can start preaching at once to those who have been waiting for me . As I talk , others come down the street , and hear , and stay to listen . Soon they number in the hundreds . I have no immense new truth to offer them : nothing that I have not said before , although piecemeal and unsystematically ; nothing they have not felt themselves , in the innermost darknesses of their beings . Today , however , knowing who I am and therefore why I am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now and then drawing on some forgotten song to show my meaning , I tell them how sick and starved their lives are ; how they have made themselves slaves ; how the enslavement is not even to a conscious mind , but to an insensate inanimate thing which their own ancestors began ; how that thing is not the centrum of existence , but a few scraps of metal and bleats of energy , a few sad stupid patterns , adrift in unbounded space-time . Put not your faith in SUM , I tell them . SUM is doomed , even as you and I. Seek out mystery ; what else is the whole cosmosp135but mystery ? Live bravely , die and be done , and you will be more than any machine . You may perhaps be God . They grow tumultuous . They shout replies , some of which are animal howls . A few are for me , most are opposed . That does n't matter . I have reached into them , my music is being played on their nervestrings , and this is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dusk gathers . The city remains unilluminated . I soon realize why . She is coming , the Dark Queen Whom they wanted me to debate with . From afar we hear Her chariot thunder . Folk wail in terror . They are not wont to do that either . They used to disguise their feelings from Her and themselvesby receiving Her with grave sparse ceremony . Now they would flee if they dared . I have lifted the masks . The chariot halts in the street . She dismounts , tall and shadowy cowled . The people make way before Her like water before a shark . She climbs the stairs to face me . I see for the least instant that Her lips are not quite firm and Her eyes abrim with tears . She whispers , too low for anyone else to hear , " Oh , Harper , I 'm sorry . " " Come join me , " I invite . " Help me set the world free . " " No . I can not . I have been too long with It . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice rises for everyone to hear . The little television robots flit close , bat shapes in the twilight , that the whole planet may witness my defeat . " What is this freedom you rant about ? " She demands . " To feel , " I say . " To venture . To wonder . To become men again . " " To become beasts , you mean . Would you demolish the machinesthat keep us alive ? " " Yes . We must . Once they were good and useful , but we let them grow upon us like a cancer , and now nothing but destruction and a new beginning can save us . " " Have you considered the chaos ? " " Yes . It too is necessary . We will not be men without the freedom to know suffering . In it is also enlightenment . Through it we travel beyond ourselves , beyond earth and stars , space and time , to Mystery . " " So you maintain that there is some undefined ultimate vaguenessbehind the measurable universe ? " She smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as children , to laugh on hearing sarcasms of this kind . " Please offer me a little proof . " " No , " I say . " Prove to me instead , beyond any doubt , that there is not something we can not understand with words and equations . Prove to me likewise that I have no right to seek for it . " The burden of proof is on You Two , so often have You lied to us . In the name of rationality , You resurrected myth . The better to control us ! In the name of liberation , You chained our inner lives and castrated our souls . In the name of service , You bound and blinkered us . In the name of achievement , You held us to a narrower round than any swine in its pen . In the name of beneficence , You created pain , and horror , and darkness beyond darkness . " I turn to the people . " I went there . I descended into the cellars . I know ! " " He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of everyone else , " cries the Dark Queen . Do I hear shrillnessin Her voice ? " Therefore he claims SUM is cruel . " " I saw my dead , " I tell them . " She will not rise again . Nor yours , nor you . Not ever . SUM will not , can not raise us . In Its house is death indeed . We must seek life and rebirth elsewhere , among the mysteries . " She laughs aloud and points to my soul bracelet , glimmering faintly in the gray-blue thickening twilight . Need She say anything ? " Will someone give me a knife and an ax ? " I ask . The crowd stirs and mumbles . I smell their fear . Streetlamps go on , as if they could scatter more than this corner of the night which is rolling upon us . I fold my arms and wait . The Dark Queen says something to me . I ignore Her . The tools pass from hand to hand . He who brings them up the stairs comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifts what I have desired . The tools are good ones , a broad-bladed hunting knife and a long double-bitted ax . Before the world , I take the knife in my right hand and slash beneath the bracelet on my left wrist . The connections to my inner body are cut . Blood flows , impossibly brilliant under the lamps . It does not hurt ; I am too exalted . The Dark Queen shrieks . " You meant it ! Harper , Harper ! " " There is no life in SUM , " I say . I pull my hand through the circle and cast the bracelet down so it rings.  |p137A  voice of brass : " Arrest that maniac for correction . He is deadly dangerous . " The monitors who have stood on the fringes of the crowd try to push through . They are resisted . Those who seek to help them encounter fists and fingernails . I take the ax and smash downward . The bracelet crumples . The organic material within , starved of my secretions , exposed to the night air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , knife in bleeding left . " I seek eternity where it is to be found , " I call . " Who goes with me ? " A score or better break loose from the riot , which is already calling forth weapons and claiming lives . They surround me with their bodies . Their eyes are the eyes of prophets . We make haste to seek a hiding place , for one military robot has appeared and others will not be long in coming . The tall engine strides to stand guard over Our Lady , and this is my last glimpse of Her . My followers do not reproach me for having cost them all they were . They are mine . In me is the godhead which can do no wrong . And the war is open , between me and SUM . My friends are few , my enemies many and mighty . I go about the world as a fugitive . But always I sing . And always I find someone who will listen , will join us , embracing pain and death like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take their souls . Afterward we hold for them the ritual of rebirth . Some go thence to become outlaw missionaries ; most put on facsimile bracelets and return home , to whisper my word . It makes little difference to me . I have no haste , who own eternity . For my word is of what lies beyond time . My enemies say I call forth ancient bestialities and lunacies ; that I would bring civilization down in ruin ; that it matters not a madman 's giggle to me whether war , famine , and pestilence will again scour the earth . With these accusationsI am satisfied . The language of them shows me that here , too , I have reawakened anger . And that emotion belongs to us as much as any other . More than the others , maybe , in this autumn of mankind . We need a gale , to strike down SUM and everything It stands for . Afterward will come the winter of barbarism . And after that the springtime of a new and ( perhaps ) more human civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lifetimes : peace , brotherhood , enlightenment , sanctity . I knowp138otherwise . I have been in the depths . The wholeness of mankind , which I am bringing back , has its horrors . When one daythe Eater of the Gods returnsthe Wolf breaks his chainthe Horsemen ride forththe Age endsthe Beast is rebornthen SUM will be destroyed ; and you , strong and fair , may go back to earth and rain . I shall await you . My aloneness is nearly ended , Daybright . Just one task remains . The god must die , that his followers may believe he is raised from the dead and lives forever . Then they will go on to conquer the world . There are those who say I have spurned and offended them . They too , borne on the tide which I raised , have torn out their machinesouls and seek in music and ecstasy to find a meaning for existence . But their creed is a savage one , which has taken them into wildcountry , where they ambush the monitors sent against them and practice cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , messengers of theirs have approached me with the suggestion of a mystic marriage . This I refused ; my wedding was long ago , and will be celebrated again when this cycle of the world has closed . Therefore they hate me . But I have said I will come and talk to them . I leave the road at the bottom of the valley and walk singing up the hill . Those few I let come this far with me have been told to abide my return . They shiver in the sunset ; the vernal equinox is three days away . I feel no cold myself . I stride exultant among briars and twisted ancient apple trees . If my bare feet leave a little blood in the snow , that is good . The ridges around are dark with forest , which waits like the skeleton dead for leaves to be breathed across it again . The easternsky is purple , where stands the evening star . Overhead , against blue , cruises an early flight of homebound geese . Their calls drift faintly down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smolders redness . Etched black against it are the women.  |p139And  now we move further toward fantasy  --  or do we ? Though occasionally employing " psionics " in stories , I was skeptical about its validity in the real world . . . until I watched a demonstration of water dowsing ( which did not work for me ) and soon afterward John Campbell made me try conduit dowsing ( which did work for me ) . I still do n't believe anything occult is involved . Rather , I think , along with such researchers as Rocard , that it 's a matter of our having sensitivities we had not officially suspected until lately , to variations in quantities like terrestrial magnetism . However , in a universe which includes things like black holes and their nonconservation properties , it 's foolish to be dogmatic . When an Edward Mitchell sees fit to found a school of noetics , I pay respectful attention . He 's been on the Moon . The body of this tale originated in a dream I had . When I told my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story . The writing was one of the hardest jobs I have ever undertaken . AS WE DROVE up between lawns and trees , Ferrier warned me , " Do n't be shocked at his appearance . " " You have n't told me anything about him , " I answered . " Not to mention . " " For good reason , " Ferrier said . " This can never be a properly controlled experiment , but we can at least try to keep down the wild variables . " He drummed fingers on the steering wheel . " I 'll say this much . He 's an important man in his field , investment counseling and brokerage . " " Oh , you mean he 's a partner in  --  Why , I 've done some business with them myself . But I never met him . " " He does n't see clientele . Or very many people ever . He works the research end . Mail , telephone , teletype , and reads a lot . "  | " Why are n't we meeting in his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ferrier parked the car and we left it . The hospital stood well out of town . It was a tall clean block of glass and metal which somehow fitted the Ohio countryside rolling away on every side , green , green , and green , here and there a whitesidedhouse , red-sided barn , blue-blooming flax field , motley of cattle , to break the corn and woodlots , fence lines and toning telephone wires . A warm wind soughed through birches and flickered their leaves ; it bore scents of a rose bed where bees querned . Leading me up the stairs to the main entrance , Ferrier said , " Why , there he is . " A man in a worn and outdated brown suit waited for us at the top of the flight . No doubt I failed to hide my reaction , but no doubt he was used to it , for his handclasp was ordinary . I could n't read his face . Surgeons must have expended a great deal of time and skill , but they could only tame the gashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin . That scar tissue would never move in human fashion . His hair did , a thin flutter of gray in the breeze ; and so did his eyes , which were blue behind glasses . I thought they looked trapped , those eyes , but it could be only a fancy of mine . When Ferrier had introduced me , the scarred man said , " I 've arranged for a room where we can talk . " He saw a bit of surprise on me and his tone flattened . " I 'm pretty well known here . " His glance went to Ferrier . " You have n't told me what this is all about , Carl . But "  --  his voice dropped  --  " considering the place  --  " The tension in my friend had hardened to sternness . " Please , let me handle this my way , " he said . When we entered , the receptionist smiled at our guide . The interiorwas cool , dim , carbolic . Down a hall I glimpsed somebody carryingflowers . We took an elevator to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which we borrowed . Ferrier sat down behind the desk , the scarred man and I took chairs confronting him . Though steel filing cabinets enclosed us , a window at Ferrier 's back stood open for summer to blow in . From this level I overlooked the old highway , nowadays a mere picturesque side road . Occasional cars flung sunlight at me . Ferrier became busy with pipe and tobacco . I shifted about . The scarred man waited . He had surely had experience in waiting.  | " Well , " Ferrier began . " I apologize to both you gentlemen . This mysteriousness . I hope that when you have the facts , you 'll agree it was necessary . You see , I do n't want to predispose your judgments or . . . or imaginations . We 're dealing with an extraordinarily subtle matter . " He forced a chuckle . " Or maybe with nothing . I give no promises , not even to myself . Parapsychological phenomena at best are "  --  he paused to search  --  " fugitive . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the scarred man said . " I do n't know much more . " Ferrier scowled . He got his pipe going before he replied : " I would n't call it a hobby . Can serious research only be done for an organization ? I 'm convinced there 's a , well , a reality involved . But solid data are damnably hard to come by . " He nodded at me . " If my friend here had n't happened to be in on one of my projects , his whole experience might as well never have been . It 'd have seemed like just another dream . " A strangeness walked along my spine . " Probably that 's all it was , " I said low . " Is . " The not-face turned toward me , the eyes inquired ; then suddenly hands gripped tight the arms of the chair , as they do when the doctor warns he must give pain . I did n't know why . It made my voice awk-ward : " I do n't claim sensitivity , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort works for me . Still , I do often have pretty detailed and , uh , coherent dreams . Carl 's talked me into describing them on a tape recorder , first thing when I wake up , before I forget them . He 's trying to check on Dunne 's theory that dreams can foretell the future . " Now I must attempt a joke . " No such luck , so far , or I 'd be rich . However , when he learned about one I had a few nights ago  --  " The scarred man shuddered . " And you happened to know me , Carl , " broke from him . The lines deepened around Ferrier 's mouth . " Go on , " he directed me , " tell your story , quick , " and cannonaded smoke . I sought from them both to the serenity beyond these walls , and I also spoke fast : " Well , you see , I 'd been alone at home for several days . My wife had taken our kid on a visit to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ESP . I 'm not a true believer , but I agree with him the evidence justifies looking further , and into curious places , too . So I was in bed , reading myself sleepy with . . . Berdyaev , to be exact , because I 'd been reading Lenau earlier , and he 's wild , sad , crazy , you may know he died insane ; nothing to go to sleep on . Did he linger anyhow , at the bottom of my mind ? " I was in a formlessness which writhed . Nor had it color , or heat or cold . Through it went a steady sound , whether a whine or drone I can not be sure . Unreasonably sorrowful , I walked , though there was nothing under my feet , no forward or backward , no purpose in travel except that I could not weep . The monsters did when they came . Their eyes melted and ran down the blobby heads in slow tears , while matter bubbled from within to renew that stare . They flopped as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their lips made gibbering motions . I was not afraid of attack , but a horror dragged through me of being forever followed by them and their misery . For now I knew that the nature of hell lies in that it goes on . I slogged , and they circled and rippled and sobbed , while the single noise was that which dwelt in the nothing , and time was not because none of this could change . Time was reborn in a voice and a splash of light . Both were small . She was barely six years old , I guessed , my daughter 's age . Brown hair in pigtails tied by red bows , and a staunch way of walking , also reminded me of Alice . She was more slender ( elven , I thought ) and more neat than my child  --  starched white flowerbud-patterned dress , white socks , shiny shoes , no trace of dirt on knees or tip-tilted face . But the giant teddy bear she held , arms straining around it , was comfortably shabby . I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be certain . The mourning was still upon me . She stopped . Her own eyes widened and widened . They were the color of earliest dusk . The monsters roiled . Then : " Mister ! " she cried . The tone was thin but sweet . It cut straight across the hum of emptiness . " Oh , Mister ! " The tumorous beings mouthed at her . They did not wish to leave me , who carried some of their woe . She dropped the bear and pointed . " Go ' way ! " I heard . " Scat ! " They shivered backward , re/surged , clustered close . " Go ' way , I want ! " She stamped her foot , but silence responded and I felt the defiance of the monsters . " All right , " she said grimly . " Edward , you make them go . " The bear got up on his hind legs and stumped toward me . He was only a teddy , the fur on him worn off in patches by much hugging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined he was alive the way the girl and I were ; she just sent him . Nevertheless he had taken a great hammer , which he swung in a fingerless paw , and becomethe hero who rescues people . The monsters flapped stickily about . They did n't dare make a stand . As the bear drew close , they trailed off sullenly crying . The sound left us too . We stood in an honest hush and a fog full of sunglow . " Mister , Mister , Mister ! " The girl came running , her arms out wide . I hunkered down to catch her . She struck me in a tumult and joy exploded . We embraced till I lifted her on high , made to drop her , caught her again , over and over , while her laughter chimed . Finally , breathless , I let her down . She gathered the bear under an elbow , which caused his feet to drag . Her free hand clung to mine . " I 'm so glad you 're here , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't know , " I answered . " Are you all by yourself ? " " Yes . ' Cept for Edward and  --  " Her words died out . At the time I supposed she had the monsters in mind and did n't care to speak of them . " What 's your name , dear ? " " Judy . " " You know , I have a little girl at home , a lot like you . Her name 's Alice . " Judy stood mute for a while and a while . At last she whispered , " Could she come play ? " My throat would n't let me answer . Yet Judy was not too dashed . " Well , " she said , " I did n't ' spect you , and you came . " Happiness rekindled in her and caught in me . Could my presence be so overwhelmingly enough ? Now I felt at peace , as though every one of the rat-fears which ride in each of us had fled me . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation , a royal command . We walked . Edward bumped along after us . The mist vanishedp144and we were on a lane between low hedges . Elsewhere reached hills , their green a palette for the emerald or silver of coppices . Cows grazed , horses galloped , across miles . Closer , birds flitted and sparkled , a robin redbreast , a chickadee , a mockingbird who poured brook-trills from a branch , a hummingbird bejeweled among bumblebeesin a surge of honeysuckle . The air was vivid with odors , growth , fragrance , the friendly smell of the beasts . Overhead lifted an enormousblue where clouds wandered . This was n't my country . The colors were too intense , crayonbrilliant , and a person could drown in the scents . Birds , bees , butterfiies , dragonflies somehow seemed gigantic , while cattle and horses were somehow unreachably far off , forever cropping or galloping . The clouds made real castles and sailing ships . Yet there was rightnessas well as brightness . I felt  --  maybe not at home , but very welcome . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll show you my garden an ' my books an ' , an ' the whole house . Even where Hoo Boy lives . Would you push me in the swing ? I only can pump myself . I pretend Edward is pushing me , an ' he says , High , high , up in the sky , Judy fly , I wonderwhy , ' like Daddy would , but it 's only pretend , like when I play with my dolls or my Noah 's ark animals an ' make them talk . Would you play with me ? " Wistfulness crossed her . " I 'm not so good at makingup ad-adventures for them . Can you ? " She turned merry again and skipped a few steps . " We 'll have dinner in the living room if you make a fire . I 'm not s'posed to make fire , I remember Daddy said , ' cept I can use the stove . I 'll cook us dinner . Do you like tea ? We have lots of different kinds . You look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make biscuits an ' we 'll put butter an ' maple syrup on them like Grandmotherdoes . An ' we 'll sit in front of the fire an ' tell stories , okay ? " And on and on . The lane was now a street , shaded by big old elms ; but it was empty save for the dappling of the sunlight , and the houses had a flatness about them , as if nothing lay behind their fronts . Wind mumbledin leaves . We reached a gate in a picket fence , which creaked when Judy opened it . The lawn beyond was quite real , aside from improbably tall hollyhocks and bright roses and pansies along the edges . So was this single house . I saw where paint had peeled and curtains faded , the least bit , as will happen to any building . ( Its neighbors stood flaw/less . ) A leftover from the turn of the century , it rambled in scaleshapedshingles , bays , turrets , and gingerbread . The porch was a cool cavern that resounded beneath our feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judy pointed to it . " I call him Billy Bungalow because he goes bung when he comes down low , " she said . " Do you want to use him ? Daddy always did , an ' made him go a lot louder than I can . Please . He 's waited such a long time . " I have too , she did n't add . I rattled the metal satisfactorily . She clapped her hands in glee . My ears were more aware of stillness behind the little noise . " Do you really live alone , brighteyes ? " I asked . " Sort of , " she answered , abruptly going solemn . " Not even a pet ? " " We had a cat , we called her Elizabeth , but she died an ' . . we was going to get another . " I lifted my brows . " We ? " " Daddy an ' Mother an ' me . C'm on inside ! " She hastened to twist the doorknob . We found an entry where a Tiffany window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand flanked a coat closet , opposite a grandfather clock which broke into triumphant booms on our arrival : for the hour instantly was six o'clock of a summer 's evening . Ahead of us swept a staircase ; right and left , doorways gave on a parlor converted to a sewing room , and on a living room where I glimpsed a fine stone fireplace . Corridors went high-ceilinged beyondthem . " Such a big house for one small girl , " I said . " Did n't you mention , uh , Hoo Boy ? " Both arms hugged Edward close to her . I could barely hear : " He 's ' maginary . They all are . " It never occurred to me to inquire further . It does n't in dreams . " But you 're here , Mister ! " Judy cried , and the house was no longer hollow . She clattered down the hall ahead of me , up the stairs , through chamber after chamber , basement , attic , a tiny space she had found beneath the witch-hat roof of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me everything . The place was bright and cheerful , did n't even echo much as we went around . The furniture was meant for cornfort . Down in the basement stood shelves of jelly her mother had put up and a workshop for her father . She showed me a half-finished toyp146sailboat he had been making for her . Her personal room bulged with the usual possessions of a child , including books I remembered well from years agorae . ( The library had a large collection too , but shadowy , a part of that home which I can not catalog . ) Good pictures hung on the walls . She had taken the liberty of pinning clippings almosteverywhere , cut from the stacks of magazines which a household will accumulate . They mostly showed animals or children . In the living room I noticed a cabinet-model radio-phonograph , though no television set . " Do you ever use that ? " I asked . She shook her head . " No , nothing comes out of it anymore . I sing for myself a lot . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' be the lord of the manor , " she ordered him . " I will be the lady making dinner , an ' Mister will be the faithful knight bringing firewood . " She went timid . " Will you , please , Mister ? " " Sounds great to me , " I smiled , and saw her wriggle for delight . " Quick ! " She grabbed me anew and we ran back to the kitchen . Our footfalls applauded . The larder was well stocked . Judy showed me her teas and asked my preference . I confessed I had n't heard of several kinds ; evidentlyher parents were connoisseurs . " So 'm I , " Judy said after I explained that word . " Then I 'll pick . An ' you tell me , me an ' Edward , a story while we eat , okay ? " " Fair enough , " I agreed . She opened a door . Steps led down to the backyard . Unlike the closely trimmed front , this was a wilderness of assorted toys , her swing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do your own gardening , do you ? " She nodded . " I 'm not very expert . But Mother promised I could have a garden here . " She pointed to a shed at the far end of the grounds . " The firewood 's in that . I got to get busy . " However firm her tone , the fingers trembled which squeezed mine . " I 'm so happy , " she whispered . I closed the door behind me and picked a route among her blossoms . Windows stood wide to a mild air full of sunset , and I heard her start singing . " The little red pony ran over the hill And galloped and galloped away  --  "  |p147The  horses in those meadows came back to me , and suddenly I stood alone , somewhere , while one of them who was my Alice fled from me for always ; and I could not call out to her . After a time , walking became possible again . But I would n't enter the shed at once ; I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving me here by myself . Instead , I brushed on past it for a look at whatever might lie behind for my comfort . That was the same countryside as before , but long-shadowed under the falling sun and most quiet . A blackbird sat on a blackberry tangle , watched me and made pecking motions . From the yard , straight southward through the land , ran a yellow brick road . I stepped onto it and took a few strides . In this light the pavementwas the hue of molten gold , strong under my feet ; here was the kind of highway which draws you ahead one more mile to see what 's over the next hill , so you may forget the pony that galloped . After all , do n't yellow brick roads lead to Oz ? " Mister ! " screamed at my back . " No , stop , stop ! " I turned around . Judy stood at the border . She shuddered inside the pretty dress as she reached toward me . Her face was stretched quite out of shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made haste . When we were safely in the yard , I held her close while the dread went out of her in a burst of tears . Stroking her hair and murmuring , at last I dared ask , " But where does it go ? " She jammed her head into the curve of my shoulder and gripped me . " T-t-to Grandmother 's . " " Why , is that bad ? You 're making us biscuits like hers , re-member ? " " We ca n't ever go there , " Judy gasped . Her hands on my neck were cold . " Well , now , well , now . " Disengaging , while still squatted to be at her height , I clasped her shoulder and chucked her chin and assuredher the world was fine ; look what a lovely evening , and we 'd soon dine with Edward , but first I 'd better build our fire , so could she help me bring in the wood ? Secretly through me went another song I know , Swedish , the meaning of it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a wholly strange world  --  " Before long she was glad once more . As we left , I cast a finalp148glance down the highway , and then caught a breath of what she felt : less horror than unending loss and grief , somewhere on that horizon . It made me be extra jocular while we took armloads of fuel to the living room . Thereafter Judy trotted between me and the kitchen , attending to her duties . She left predictable chaos , heaped dishes , scorched pan , strewn flour , smeared butter and syrup and Lord knows what else . I forbore to raise the subject of cleanup . No doubt we 'd tackle that tomorrow . I did n't mind . Later we sat cross-legged under the sofa where Edward presided , ate our biscuits and drank our tea with plenty of milk , and laughed a great deal . Judy had humor . She told me of a Fourth of July celebrationshe had been at , where there were so many people " I bet just their toes weighed a hundred pounds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and  --  she must have listened to adult talk  --  she insisted that in any properly regulated universe , Samuel Gompers would have invented rubber boots . The flames whirled red , yellow , blue , and talked back to the ticking , booming clock ; shadows played tag across walls ; outside stood a night of gigantic stars . " Tell me another story , " she demanded and snuggled into my lap , the calculating minx . Borrowing from what I had done for Alice , I spun a long yarn about a girl named Judy , who lived in the forest with her friends Edward T. Bear and Billy Bungalow and Hoo Boy , until they built a candy-striped balloon and departed on all sorts of explorations ; and her twilight-colored eyes got wider and wider . They drooped at last , though . " I think we 'd better turn in , " I suggested . " We can carry on in the morning . " She nodded . " Yesterday they said today was tomorrow , " she observed , " but today they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electrics would be harsh to us ; but they were n't . We went upstairs , Judy on my right shoulder , Edward on my left . She guided me to a guest room , pattered off , and brought back a set of pajamas . " Daddy would n't mind , " she said . " Would you like me to tuck you in ? " I asked . " Oh  --  " For a moment she radiated . Then the seriousness came upon her . She put finger to chin , frowning , before she shook her head . " No , thanks . I do n't think you 're s'posed for that . " " All right . " My privilege is to see Alice to her bed ; but eachp149family has its own tradition . Judy must have sensed my disappointment , because she touched me and smiled at me , and when I stooped she caught me and breathed , " You 're really real , Mister . I love you , " and ran down the hall . My room resembled the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes and Chinese castles which I had seen in the clouds . Gauzy white curtains , aflutter in easy airs , veiled away those lantern-big stars . Above the bed Judy had pinned a picture of a galloping pony . I thought of a trip to the bathroom , but felt no need . Besides , I might disturb my hostess ; I had no doubt she brushed her teeth , being such a generally dutiful person . Did she say prayers too ? In spite of Alice , I do n't really understand little girls , any more than I understand how a mortal could write Jesu Joy of Man 's Desiring . Boys are different ; it 's true about the slugs and snails and puppy dogs ' tails . I 've been there and I know . I got into the pajamas , lay down in the bed and the breeze , turned off the light , and was quickly asleep . Sometimes we remember a night 's sleep . I spent this one being happy about tomorrow . Maybe that was why I woke early , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The curtains rippled and blew , but there was no sound whatsoever . Or . . . a rustle ? I lay half awake , eyes half open and peace behind them . Someone moved about . She was very tall , I knew , and she was tidying the house . I did not try , then , to look upon her . In my drowsiness , she might as well have been the wind . After she had finished in this chamber , I came fully to myself , and saw how bureau and chair and the bulge of blankets that my feet made were strangers in the dusk which runs before the sun . I swung legs across bedside , felt hardwood under my soles . My lungs drank odors of grass . Oh , Judy will snooze for hours yet , I thought , but I 'll go peek in at her before I pop downstairs and start a surprise breakfast . When dressed , I followed the hallway to her room . Its door was n't shut . Beyond , I spied a window full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p150She  did n't use real words . You often do n't , over a small bed . She sang well-worn nonsense , " Cloddledy loldy boldy boo , Cloddledy lol-dy bol-dy boo-oo , " stay or ever return , who looked beyond the Edge . I covered my eyes . I 'm sorry , she said ; and I believe she touched my head as she passed from us . Judy awakened . " Mister  --  " She lifted her arms , wanting me to come and be hugged , but I did n't dare . " I have to leave , sweetheart , " I told her . She bolted to her feet . " No , no , no , " she said , not loud at all . " I wish I could stay awhile , " I answered . " Can you guess how much I wish it ? " Then she knew . " You . . . were awful kind . . . to come see me , " she got out . She went to me with the same resolute gait as when first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked downstairs together and forth into the morning . " Will you say hello to your daughter from me ? " she requested once . " Sure , " I said . Hell , yes . Only how ? We went along the flat and empty street , toward the sun . Whereto the tenderest melody I have ever heard . I think that tune was what drew me on helpless , till I stood in the entrance . And she stood above Judy . I could n't truly see her : a blue shadow , maybe ? Judy was as clear to me as she is this minute , curled in a prim nightgown , one arm under her cheek ( how long the lashes and stray brown hair ) , the other around Edward , while on a shelf overhead , Noah 's animals kept watch . The presence grew aware of me . She turned and straightened , taller than heaven . Why have you looked ? she asked me in boundless gentleness . Now you must go , and never come back . No , I begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this , she sighed , you cannotp151a blackbird perched on an elm bough , and the leaves made darkness beneath , she halted . " Good-bye , you good Mister , " she said . She would have kissed me had I had the courage . " Will you remember me , Judy ? " " I 'll play with my remembering of you . Always . " She snapped after air ; but her head was held bravely . " Thanks again . I do love you. , , So she let me go , and I left her . A single time I turned around to wave . She waved back , where she stood under the sky all by herself . The scarred man was crying . He was n't skilled in it ; he barked and hiccoughed . Surgically , Ferrier addressed him . " The description of the house corresponds to your former home . Am I correct ? " The hideous head jerked a nod . " And you 're entirely unfamiliar with the place , " Ferrier declared to me . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right , " I said . " I 'd no reason before today to suppose I 'd had anything more than a dream . " Anger flickered . " Well , God damn your scientific caution , now I want some explanations . " " I ca n't give you those , " Ferrier admitted . " Not when I 've no idea how the phenomenon works . You 're welcome to what few facts I have . " The scarred man toiled toward a measure of calm . " I , I , I apologize for the scene , " he stuttered . " A blow , you realize . Or a hope ? " His gaze ransacked me . " Do you think we should go see her ? " Ferrier suggested . For reply , the scarred man led us out . We were silent in corridor and elevator . When we emerged on the third floor , the hospital smell struck hard . He regained more control over himself as we passed among rubber-tired nurses and views of occupied beds . But his gesture was rickety that , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay several patients and a near-total hush . Abruptly I understood why he , important in the world , went ill-clad . Hospitals do n't come cheap . His voice grated : " Telepathy , or what ? The brain is n't gone ; not a flat EEG . Could you  --  " That went as far as he was able.  | " No , " I said , while my fingers struggled with each other . " It must have been a fluke . And since , I 'm forbidden . " We had stopped at a cluster of machinery . " Tell him what happened , " Ferrier said without any tone whatsoever . The scarred man looked past us . His words came steady if a bit shrill . " We were on a trip , my wife and daughter and me . First we meant to visit my mother-in-law in Kentucky . " " You were southbound , then , " I foreknew . " On a yellow brick road . " They still have that kind , here and there in our part of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " My wife was killed . I became what you see . Judy  --  " He chopped a hand toward the long white form beneath us . " That was nineteen years ago , " he ended.  |p153This  involves a science and contains a fiction . Therefore it is science fiction . Right ? ADMIRING THE ADS in Scientific American a while back  --  they are always a potent source of wonder  --  I was pleased to see that the General Dynamics Corporation still refers to element number 74 as tungsten . I strongly disapprove of the arbitrary and high-handed 1949 decree of the International Union of Chemistry , that hereafter everybodyshall call it wolfram . Admittedly this squares with the symbol , W. But damn it , " tungsten " was what I learned , and what they make light bulbs with , and if it was good enough for Scheele it 's good enough for the International Union of Chemistry . They 're probably just an affiliate of the Teamsters anyway . Aye , tear that tattered ensign down ! I growled some such remark to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the name " wolfram " came from . Well , I said , it 's the German word for tungsten  --  no harm in that , if only the Germanswould n't be so aggressive about it  --  and comes from wolframite , the principal ore . So what 's wolframite named for , she wanted to know . I suppose some chemist named Wolfram , who first described it , I shrugged , and got down the American College Encyclopedic Dictionary . It gave the mineral derivation as expected , but said that " wolfram " was of uncert. orig . I was astonished . Turning to Webster , I found G. wolf , meaning " wolf , " and rahm , meaning " cream , soot . " Wolf cream ? Wolf soot ? Try as I might , I could n't make sense of it . Webster evidently feels the same way , because his etymology reads " said to be fr. , " etc . In other words , he 's passing on this ridiculous bit of folklore for lack of anything better , but disclaiming all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole episode , so much so that he has forgotten to capitalize the German nouns . By far the most believable theory is that there was a Wolfram , whose pioneer study of this material won him the honor of having his name bestowed upon it , but who fell into deep posthumous obscurity . Had Webster ransacked enough archives , he would surely have discovered the reference . However , since Wolfram was not a professional chemist ( had he been , his name would have gotten into the histories that Webster presumably did consult , if only as a footnote ) it 's hard to know a priori just where to begin looking . Nevertheless , I can see him quite clearly , this humble worker in the vineyard of science , altogether overshadowed by his gigantic contemporaries but , perhaps on that very account , shining across time 's abyss with a luster of simple humanity and mixed metaphors . Karl Georg Johann Friedrich Augustus Wolfram , born and died in the eighteenth century , court librarian to the Margrave of OberhausBlicksteinor whatever the place was called , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought back samples of outcroppingsin his pockets , to be pored over until the candles guttered low . . . . He can not have been even of petty noble birth , or the histories would have paid him some attention . Nor can Oberhaus-Blickstein have been one of the brilliant and intensively studied principalities of that era , like Brandenburg . No , it was undoubtedly a backwater , peaceful , prosperous , a little smug and complacent , inhabited by peasants who tugged their forelocks and said , " Jawohl , Herr Rittergutsbesitzer " when the squire told them what to do and then went ahead and did the right thing anyway , by artisans and shopkeepers in the villages , and by the bourgeoisie of Schickenburg-am-Pfaff . This sleepy old town probably boasted a brick warehouse at the dock where the river barges left cargo twice a month ; a pleasant though undistinguished cathedral said , on no very reliable evidence , to have been begun by Henry the Lion ; several fine mansions ; and of course a small palace . Even in this idyllic setting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at court . Not that it mattered if the present Margrave was given to pinching servant girls and spent too much on imported fanciments , notably wine . ( Since he really did n't know a thing about wine , the French shippers cheated him shamelessly ; inp155the regional idiom , they took him by the nose and swung him around their heads . But nobody ever told the Margrave , so little harm was done . ) Such things were acceptable . In fact , a Margrave with no minor vices would have seemed unnatural . However , in his youth this one had spent a year in Paris and become a liberal . Not too many years ago he had actually corresponded with Voltaire . Luckily , the phase passed . Voltaire did nothing to encourage the correspondence  --  the Margrave 's letters were incredibly dull  --  and so his enthusiasm petered out . He settled down to being as cultivated a gentleman as his limited means , his excessive distance from the centersof world civilization , and his not very sharp wits would allow . On the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Not at all like his mad grandfather , the one who built that curious castle on the Hochhiigel , where the moat was inside the walls to keep the swans safe . The duties of his librarian were not onerous . Karl Georg JohannFriedrich Augustus Wolfram needed only take care of a generations-old collection of astoundingly unimportant books and documents , work desultorily at cataloging them , and recommend new acquisitions , which his master dutifully ordered but , as a rule , fell asleep over . The pay was not high , but not niggardly either ; he could maintain a modest , comfortable house , a couple of servants , and six children . And he had social standing , attended court functions , enjoyedthe friendship of other intellectuals like the Kapellmeister . A more dubious privilege was that of playing chess with the Margrave . It took skill and concentration to lose those games , particularly since they had to look hard-fought . Still , this was no major nuisance ; and when the Kapellmeister visited the Wolframs , well , then they played real chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court librarian was quite an eminence for the fourth son of a shopkeeper to have reached . Of course , once when he was a boy , and the schoolmaster said that Karl Georg was the most brilliantLatin pupil he had ever had , and there was talk of sending him to Berlin to study  --  But that was long ago . Nothing had come of it . Best be content with what God has given one . This is not so little . A secure position ; a good , sensible , if somewhat barrel-shaped wife ; six fine living children ; and , certainly , one 's correspondence , one 's contacts with the great world beyond the banks of the Pfaff . . . . Few Schickenburgers had any inkling of their court librarian'sp156other life . The Margrave did , but never really appreciated its significance ; the Kapellmeister did , but was never in a position to do anything about it . Outwardly the Herr Hofbibliothekar Karl Georg Johann Friedrich Augustus Wolfram was the most staid and ordinary of men . You could set your watch by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on workdays . His clothes were conservative , even a trifle old-fashioned  --  for Schickenburg , that is , which would have made them ludicrously out-of-date in Paris  --  and reasonablyneat ( albeit his wife was once heard to mutter that he was the only man she knew of who could get gravy on his wig ) . He was a kindly paterfamilias , a bit pompous but not unduly strict by the standards of that day and age ; in the evenings he often gathered his family about him and read aloud from edifying books . Every Sunday morning saw him in church , every Sunday early afternoon seated at a gargantuan dinner , every Sunday late afternoon fast asleep . He allowed himself one pipeful of tobacco per diem , though to be sure it was a very large pipe , whose bowl stood on the floor . Alcohol was limited to a little beer or wine , except during Fasching , when he sometimes got mildly fiddly and recited Latin anacreontics . He did not make financial speculations , frequent the taverns , or pinch servantgirls . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was nothing unusual in the eighteenth century . What OberhausBlicksteindid not realize was the considerable actual and the possibly very great potential stature of the man . He corresponded regularly with Linnaeus , and it seems quite probable that the suggestions he made , out of his orderly catalog-oriented mind , had much to do with the evolution of the Swedish master 's taxonomy . In his later years he became a corresponding member of the Royal Society . There were men in Paris and London who had never heard of OberhausBlicksteinbut who , if the name Wolfram was mentioned , would nod and say , " Oh , yes , did n't he do something about minerals ? " We have seen that his description of wolframite , summarizing every reference in the literature and adding keen original observationsby which it could instantly be identified , was honored by the bestowal of his name upon it . Hitherto every local set of rustics in Europe , if they noticed the stuff at all , had given it some loutish name of their own , like " wolf cream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever , scientists around the world could know exactly what ore was meant and what properties to expect . His interests were not confined to mineralogy and natural history . Indeed , he himself considered these his minor hobbies . He was quite musical , playing both the violin and the harpsichord with some skill . A rather charming little hymn , sung locally to this day on the Eve of St. Odo , is attributed to Wolfram . He had connections with Leipzig , and one of the lesser-known Bach sonatas is dedicated to him . ( Not the Bach  --  a fourth cousin twice removed . ) Much of his time was spent on a ponderous compilation of regional folklore , with commentaries , which he regarded as his life 's masterwork . Unfortunately , it is written in so crabbed a style , and is based on so erroneous an identification of every figure in every Marchen with something in Classical mythology , that not even Max Muller was able to make any use of it . By contrast , Wolfram 's letters are fluent , brilliantly reasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today are sufficientlywell educated to savor . His life had a normal share of disappointments and blunders . Though he angled for decades to get a patent of nobility , so he might inscribe that magical " von " in front of his name , he never mustered enough influence . In 1768 a young Frenchman wrote to him about certain ideas he had conceived in the field of chemistry . The reply was so disparaging that Lavoisier made no attempt at further correspondence . Wolfram admitted his mistake afterward , in a communicationto Linnaeus , but pleaded that the gout which had bothered him of late years had made him irritable that day . He was quite an old man when Goethe passed through Oberhaus-Blickstein and was the Margrave 's guest for a night . Wolframlooked forward to this encounter for months . The diary of his friend the Kapellmeister relates how he spent days rehearsing what he would say , the questions , the comments , the little aphorisms out of a long experience to offer the young titan . He bought an entire new set of clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical bills had been so heavy that he could ill afford to . Yes , Goethe came ; and there was an interminable reception line , followed by an interminable banquet , after which the party repaired to the concert hall and heard a recital by the Margrave 's oldest granddaughterand an original composition for voice and wind instruments by the Margrave himself . Goethe 's eyes were closed and his headp158sunken onto his chest throughout this entertainment , doubtless so he could concentrate better . Immediately afterward he excused himself , since he must rise betimes to continue his journey in the morning . ( However , at the banquet he had sat next to the youngest niece of the Margrave , who was then a widower , and been at his most charming , just beyond earshot of the court librarian . No one inquired where she spent the night . ) As for the Herr Hofbibliothekar Wolfram , he was introduced at the reception , bowed , said , " I am Your Excellency 's very admiring servant , " and moved on with the line . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a mercy . His admiration had never extended to the liberal ideas current in his time . Humane by nature , he nonetheless expected nothing but trouble from any upset of a social order which , at least in Oberhaus-Blickstein , worked so well . He would have known his forebodings confirmed , had he lived to witness that last scene of pitiful gallantry , when his old blind Margrave rode forth at the head of the principality 's men to meet Napoleon and surrender . Sleep well , Karl Georg Johann Friedrich Augustus Wolfram . You would n't have tried to steal the name off tungsten.  |p159And  so we come to the last step of our exploration . The study of prehistory is a science , and " caveman " stories have always been admissible as science fiction , even when they had no additional speculative elements such as " The Long Remembering " does . But archaeology , including the archaeology of what written history somewhat remembers , is a science too . I wrote " The Peat Bog " for a proposed volume of tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first century A.D. Editor Ray Nelson has graciously agreed to its use in the present collection . But would you then call it a historical narrative , or  --  since it extrapolates from archaeological discoveries  --  science fiction ? I think you can say either or both , and thus it helps illustrate the artificiality of categories , and that 's why I wanted it in this book . Besides , it may persuade you to go someday to Silkeborg in Denmark , and there at the museum visit the Tollund Man . You 'll like him . E TRAVELED OVERLAND from Massilia to Colonia Agrippina , where we spent the winter while Memmius studied language and gathered intelligence . He required me to join him in the first of these , and said he hoped I could be of value in the second ; but I was n't . That land weighed on me too heavily . It was not so much that the town was small and raw , most of the streets only hog-wallows twisting between timber houses whose shapes were all wrong , the population a garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dark slow river . One expects this on a frontier . In truth , our passage through Gaul had agreeably surprised me by the extent to which civilization had flowed north outp160of the Narbonnese in the bare hundred or so years since divine Julius opened that sluice gate . Paved roads , orderly fields , neat little cities where one might find not just an amphitheater but men who quoted Euripides or Aristotle as naturally as would a born Greek  --  When I remarked on this to Memmius , the leather of his face had crinkled upward , and he drawled : " Look closer , Philon . Those people do n't even walk like you or me , let alone think the same way . And wait till we get farther north , where the bodies themselves are nothing you 'll find anywhere around the Midworld Sea . Rome 's spread thinner than I really care to say out loud . New territories like Britain , it 's obvious enough there ; but here too , here too . " As we came into German country , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't trouble me . Memmius ' enterpriseshad already taken us as far afield as Mauretania and Pontus . If anything  --  after I began to catch a bit of the language , which struck me as rather pleasingly resonant , not the harsh gabble it 's often called  --  if anything , I felt less far from home here than in , say , Jerusalem . Here , the attitude did not seem to be shameless importunity and slynesscloaking a resentment which seethed in the marrow . Instead , my impression was of an odd blend of somewhat boorish affability with inward pride . " You beat us in these parts , but we won in the Teutoburg Forest , both fair and square . Now let 's see if we ca n't get along . " So their eyes appeared to say . I knew I might be reading what was n't there into that blueness . Maybe it came from my liking the frank way they strode along , girls almost as big and handsome as boys . And trees were ablaze with autumn , stubble fields golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , by day full of humus odors and wild goose calls . If the fare and accommodations were coarse , beer preferable to what passed locally for wine , the ride long between each pair of stopping places , why , I have never minded that . I expected to find reasonable contentment in Colonia . What I did not foresee was , first , the confinement , the shrinking of the world to a stockade and fosse . Oh , it was not impossible to go out : even , by prearrangement , across the river , where the unconqueredChatti were milder than the reputation they have in Rome . But there was soon no point in it ; I had seen everything the country/side had to offer of human variety that lay within a day 's round trip . This was the more true when those days really began to shorten . The town rated no such name . It was hardly more than a militaryoutpost , set down by Claudius a few years ago upon what had been a marketplace for yeomen , fishers , charcoal burners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , that did us no good now . Now was a commandant , the top of the social heap , whose brain was cast iron ; a hairy half-educated oaf who grunted us through our language lessons ; what few books I had brought along and quickly memorized ; chilly rooms , smoky fires , gloom . Winter cast me far down . It was warmer than I had anticipated , or I should say less cold . But the dankness gnawed in to the liver , even as the murk  --  heavy gray skies above snow and mud , until day 's brief glimmer was swallowed by monstrous black  --  ate at my soul . O islands white against sun-dazzled lapping purple , a temple seen through olive trees as tiny and bright as a star ! They danced in my head like the wisps of a dream . Memmius seemed unaffected , the same deceptively easygoing businessman he had always shown to the world . He studied , fared about , talked , questioned , bargained , bribed , joked , insinuated , did all that a Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never in a hurry , never letting on that his purpose included anythingsave a commercial venture . Whether his source of information be the provincial governor passing through or a raggedy crone peddlingturnips on an icy corner , an arrogant princely warrior come the whole way from Scandia to see what glory he might pick up or a lout from just across the river , a courtesan who knew everybody or a slave girl rented for a few nights from her horizon-bound rustic owner  --  he asked , he probed , he learned , he pondered . I kept records of whatever he chose me to witness or to be told afterward . And , having a gift for tongues , I presently spoke better German than he did . But otherwise I was sad and useless . He tried to jolly me out of it . One night he even called me to his bed , a thing he had not done for half a dozen years , when I turned fourteen and he laughed that I was getting too angular for his taste . ( Then he manumitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly attended his wife ; a Greek amanuensis-cum-factotum is an elegant thing for a Roman lady to have . Later he began using me for real , often con/fidential work . How burstingly proud I was when he explained : " We 're not bound north only to see if we can open new trade . We 'll also be on a mission for Caesar . " And the characteristically sardonic : " Caesar 's ministers , at least ; Nero seems to consider other interests more urgent . . . . The fact is , Britain 's near the boiling point , Gaul not as quiet as it might be , the Germans beyond the marches moving about  --  and new powers rising , seaborne , on the far side of the CimbrianChersonese . . . . Maybe those chiefs plan no threat to Rome 's holdings , no alliances with rebels . Maybe . That 's for Rome to find out , and try to influence . We 've agents in Scandia and the islands . My task is to find out how things are on the peninsula ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " He , Gnaeus Valerius Memmius , asked me what I , freedman Philon who did not even know my father 's name , what I thought about this ! ) But that night was n't what we 'd sometimes , earlier had . He was kindly as always , yet  --  a trifle too abstracted , or too competent ?  --  or had simply too long a while passed ? He still had the hawk profile , but it was grizzled and deeply furrowed . I think he sensed the same as myself , for at length he raised his leanness on an elbow , stroked my cheek , and said , smiling a bit through guttering yellow lamplight : " Philon , I believe you need a girl . " " No , not really . " I huddled against him , though mainly because the room was cold . The breath puffed white from our lips . " She 'd keep you warm , " he said . " And me , for that matter . In spring , when we leave , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gotten pregnant . " Her name was Gerda and she was , indeed , quite appealing , a stocky blonde who was anxious to learn our wishes and , once she discovered we would n't mistreat her , given to singing little songs while she worked around the house . I did n't always blow out the flame and pretend she was Hephaestion to my Alexander ; sometimes I enjoyed that she was Gerda , who demanded no more than I wanted to give . Not that we often slept together . I was n't that interested . And Memmius was : largely because she was a Longobard , captured in some clash with the Chatti and passed westward hand to hand . North of the Longobards dwell the Saxons , and north of the Saxons are the Cimbrians among others , and it is from the Cimbrian peninsula that that horde came which almost overwhelmed Rome , a century and ap163half ago . The tribes there are still powerful . It 's not strictly true that they asked for our friendship , when a Roman fleet visited them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which every delegation to the barbarians makes . They did show our men hospitality , and they are  --  like their rivals to the east  --  actively trading with us . That 's all . The trade is usually through a long chain of middlemen . We do n't know enough about what 's going on in those parts . Rome has had some catastrophic surprises in the past . On the other hand , granted sufficient information and connections , Rome has been able to play one foreign faction off against another . Like , say , the Cimbriansversus the Scandians . .. . Gerda did n't greatly brighten my mood , though . Springtime did , sunlight and greenness , messages from outside , packing up and ho-ha for saddle leather under me again ! Lately I 've been remembering her , bulge-bellied and weeping , when Memmius handed her over to a dealer . At the time , I was too wild with my own freedom to notice . We jogged through Belgic Gaul to Gesoriacum . I 'd done considerabledetail work for us , arranging that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . The goods were perfectly genuine , silverware , glassware , fine cloth , oils : for those people who dwell between the German and Suebian Seas have a shrewd awareness of the value of their amber , furs , hides , tallow , beeswax . " I am at least as concerned , " Memmius said , " with establishing a profitable connectionas I am with bulwarking the legions . " Beyond the sandy isles and half-drowned marshlands of Frisia , the peninsula thrusts northward . It is also low country , yet not flat ; hills rise steep to offer tremendous vistas across moors where only the yellow of gorse breaks the darkling reach of heather . The west coast , like much of the interior , is virtually treeless . What few oaks and evergreens have laid root in its poor soil are stunted , witchily gnarled , bent to the east as if straining from the endless wind . It comes off the sea , that wind , bleak and salt , roaring , streaming ; clouds flee before it , their shadows scythe over the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of a god . Nevertheless heaven arches so vast that  --  save in the frequent rains  --  the clouds seem lost therein , as do the thousands of waterfowl , storks , herons , hawks , eagles , crows , ravens , every kind of wings aloft.  |p164Our  pilot was Eporedorix , a Gaul who had been here often before and led us to a sheltered bay where the amber buyers customarilystop . This merchantman was too deep-bottomed to beach like the light barbarian craft , which depend more on oars or paddles than on sail . Captain Scaubo growled he 'd sooner lie at anchor anyway , just in case . " You 're a suspicious old Lusitanian , are n't you ? " I jested . He looked sour . Memmius grinned : " That 's how he got to be old , Philon . " Nobody was around when the dinghy set us ashore . We were well in advance of the bartering season . For months the tribesmen would be working their farms , chasing deer across the heaths , trappinghares , catching fish and seal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter . Women and children would gather oysters and , after every storm , amber that had been cast on the beaches . " We 'll have a short wait , though , " Memmius assured me . " Word about us will move around fast . " He had deliberately come early , to get settled and begin gathering firsthand information free of the tumult which marts and moots would create . I stared at enormous manlessness and asked , " How will they know ? " " Oh , natives , they got instincts , like animals , " Scaubo grunted . Memmius shrugged . " It looks simpler to me , " he said , " to posit that a herdboy can spy our smoke from ten miles away , and his brotherscan lope thirty miles in a day to tell the neighbors . " He turned . A red cloak flapped around his tunic . " Let 's pitch camp . And unload the horses , especially . I want to be sure they 've got their land legs when our yokels arrive . " Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assemblingof a small shrine , and himself made the thank-offering to Neptune for safe passage . Memmius added one to Mercury , since we would be faring along roads now , though I knew he believed in no gods  --  merely in that dance of blind atoms which Lucretius has written of -- and acted pious lest he rouse superstitious fears . This country was so daunting . Myself , I wandered off . In chilly dusk , in a clump of grass behind a dune , I found a coltsfoot growing , the first frail flower of spring , and knelt to call without words upon Aphrodite . Memmius is wily and learned , he is doubtless right about the absurdity of the myths ,  |p165very  possibly most of the world arises from a play of forces and nothingelse ; but She is . I have felt Her too often to imagine otherwise . I am alone  --  I did not speak to Her  --  my heart flutters like a snared swallow , I am alike full of grief and of a joy I know will come to me in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the years of my life but feel too that they are infinitely deep , and none of this do I understand . Lady of All , what do You want of me ? Surf growled outside the bay . The tide was coming in , that eternal onslaught we do not know in the Midworid Sea . I slept poorly , with many dreams . The next day , however , opened in peace except for a brief , thunderful hailstorm . We explored the area , finding countless traces of former encampments : fire sites , potsherds , gnawed bones , crude carvings on boulders which might have been done in idleness or might be sacred . Generations of feet , hoofs , wheels had worn a trail from inland through the brush , so broad and hard-packed it could almost be called a road . Some of the younger sailors and I took weaponsand followed it a few miles . Near the end of our venture we came upon a row of great mounds . Though overgrown , several of them had in the course of ages worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I 've seen dolmens like that at home ! " I cried . " You find them everywhere along the coasts , from Caria to here and maybe farther , " said Hippodamas , who had become my friend on the sea trip , being a fellow Greek and a bright , good-looking lad . " We saw them when we rounded Armorica , and rows of standing stones too , stark as teeth in a dead giant 's jaw . " " Who made them ? " I whispered . " Who knows ? I dug into one once . Full of skeletons . " " Tombs  --  " It came upon me that here was no new land . It was ancient beyond knowing , secret beyond imagining . Hippodamas saw me shiver and laid a comforting arm around my waist . No fool , he was yet no brooder like me , but lived toughly and merrily in each day as it came . We walked thus awhile , till everybodydecided to turn around . Then we found ourselves at the tail of the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You know , Philon , since you shaved this morning , your face could be a girl 's . " Beneath the wind , my cheeks heated . " A touch too strong in the chin , maybe , " he went on , a teasingp166which softened to : " But those 're nice lips , and straight nose , curly black hair , fine hazel eyes . . . . How about it ? " " Uh , " I mumbled in a wave of confusion . " We 've been warned how chaste the German women are , " he laughed . A marvelous interplay of muscles went through his arm where it circled above my hips . " That whore in Gesoriacum is far behind me . Hm ? " " I  --  I  --  " It did not seem to be me that stammered , " No , I 'm sorry , Hippodamas , but  --  " He let go . " Do n't tell me you 've never , like a Jew . " " No , but  --  " " Ah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite . I understand . " He left me and fell into overanimated conversation with a shipmate . But I do n't understand ! I wanted to cry after him . It 's only . . . I do n't know what it is . Here , here , She has made something ready for me . I ca n't imagine how I knowStaring around : This stern strange country , oh , that must have stirred a thing to life in me , a longing for  --  But I am already free ! A freedman , at least , under the supervision of a kindly and interesting man who . . . who will surely be visiting Greece again , next year or the year after , for a while , and will want me to come along . . . wo n't he ? Hippodamas , do n't be angry because I have fallen into Her hands . I was outwardly silent the rest of that day . Next noon the dwellersarrived . We saw them from afar , but were nonetheless surprised . True , most were locals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , axes , long cutting-action swords of soft brown iron , or mere cudgels  --  about thirty altogether . But at their head came half a dozen riders in helmet and ringmail . Eporedorix bustled about directing us in how to form up . He wanted no bristling defensive ranks that , by assuming hostility , might provoke it . Rather , we took stances from which we could instantly leap to form a shield-locked square . Memmius donned his toga and advanced in proper Roman dignity . From my post I peered and peered , every thew aquiver , pulse loud in my skull and throat . Were these the terrible Cimbrians ?  |p167They  averaged taller than men of the Midworld , but not inordinatelyso , perhaps three or four inches ; and their build was more stocky than lean . While some had sun-bleached hair whiter than flax , that of others was brown , red , or black . They cropped it short , like their beards . The only really alien feature was the eyes , sea-pale in those weathered faces . They wore knee-length tunics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen trousers . Fabrics were dyed with woad , madder , and  --  dimly  --  berry juices . Their shoes were hairy , strapped around the foot and laced to the ankle . Such were the walkers : men of this neighborhood , farmers , fishers , hunters , trappers , diggers of peat , who had so little worth stealing that whole lifetimes might pass without a war other than the strife against nature which had no truce . They were brave , hardy , and , I thought then , simple . The riders , on hammer-headed shaggy-dun ponies , resembled them in many ways , but were a little bigger , much straighter , their hands not misshapen from toil  --  an upper class . Their conical noseguardedhelmets and knee-length ring-byrnies seemed well made , and might give better protection than a legionary 's loricae . The clothes beneath were of good , colorful stuff . They were clean-shaven but wore their hair somewhat longer than the peasants , drawing it into a braid that hung down the left shoulder . They halted at the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Greeting , " he said in his German . " We come in peace , as friends , from Rome the Great . " The natives looked nonplussed . One or two snickered . The leadinghorseman rode from their line , dipped his lance , and , smiling , replied , " Greeting and welcome to the country of the High Jutes "  --  in accented but comprehensible Latin . I could only gape . Memmius recovered fast , spoke smooth phrases , told us to lay aside our arms , and invited the barbarians to dine . " We thank you , " said their leader . Beneath his courtesy twinkled the same amusement as before . He had a fine voice , deep and melodious , rising slowly from the depths of the barrel chest . " I am Hesting , son of Beroan , king  --  or perhaps you 'd call me duke  --  of High Jutland , on whose Weststrands you have landed . " Springing to earth with a litheness unusual for his compact build , he clasped Memmius ' hand and arm in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not young  --  past forty , I guessed  --  though he carried himself so well that this could only be told from the gray in his ruddy locks , furrows and crinkles in his face , unconscious masterfulness in his bearing . Crowsfeet around lightning-blue eyes , lines across broad brow , calipers from strongly curved nose to wide mobile mouth , startling dimples , bespoke years of looking across wide horizons , of thought , and of laughter . Suddenly I imagined Odysseus resembling , not idealized cold marble , but Hestingthe Jute . Through wind and surf , while cloud shadows chilled and the quick wan sun touched me , smelling salt and kelp , feeling sand hiss past my ankles , I watched the chieftain and heard him . He met Scaubo and Eporedorix with easy politeness , as if they were already old comrades . He passed among our crewmen , while heartening his followers with jokes in their own rough tongue , till both groups relaxedand started shyly to mingle . By then I had discovered that the language here , while akin to what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were lucky to hit on a speaker of Latin . We had a good foundation , of course , and ought soon to be reasonably fluent in Jutish ; but Hesting could expedite matters for us no end . It made me wonder if Her will had brought him . He explained things frankly and amicably while we showed him around our camp and ship , spread the best repast we could , made the gifts to him and his men which barbarians always expect ( and Homer 's heroes did ) . We Romans had  --  as usual , his eyes if not his lips seemed to chuckle  --  taken an overhasty view of a complex situation . ( Memmius nodded , unsurprised . How accurate a picture can you compile from a few travelers ' tales and , otherwise , third- or fourth-hand rumor ? ) The Cimbrians proper , whom Hesting called Himmeri , lived to the north of his own folk . Beyond them were the Vandals . The High Jutes ( " I 'd say the name comes less from boasting , though we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the country " ) occupied the middle of the peninsula , its major section . South of them dwelt the Heruls , Angles , and lesser folk . These were all separate kingdoms , if that is the right word when a king is , essentially , no more than president at meetings of tribal chieftains , leader in war , and head priest . ( Later I would learn what a clumsy simplification that was too , which we made at the time outp169of Hesting 's laconic answers to questions . ) But since they were of the same basic stock , they tended more and more to call themselves , collectively , Jutes . This was the easier to do because nowadays they fought each other far less often than they did the Danes . These were another set of folk , related but distinct , currently migrating from Scandia into the islands , driving out or subjugating the inhabitants . Their swift , many-oared ships had long been raiding the eastern coast of the peninsula . Hesting expected a full-scale invasion this summer . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to be in our vicinity . Every spring , after the equinoctial ceremonies at Holy Lake , the Goddess  --  Whom he called Nerthus while he signed his brow , lips , breast , and loins  --  traveled around the realm to bless it , as She did in other processions in the other kingdoms . He must accompany Her . Thus he had not been far off when word came of a foreign ship . Though the season was too sacred for combat , it had been only prudent for him and a few of his household warriors to arm themselves and go investigate . They must be back before dark . As for how he came to know Latin , why , he laughed , that also was reasonable . Rome having conquered the Gauls and certain of the Germans , she was now the greatest power in this part of the world as well as southward . Besides possible diplomatic and military interaction , there was a growing volume of trade , thus far mostly with the mobile Danes . Why should the Jutes not get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving hitches in the legions , had picked up quite a lot of knowledge useful in war . Jutes had better bestir themselves likewise . Therefore Hesting had visited both Roman Germany and northernGaul as a young man . Later he had acquired a Latin-speaking slave who kept him in practice . This man had lately died of a flux , however . Hesting had been hoping for the advent of somebody important . He and Memmius traded a glance which lasted for several heartbeats after he said that . Oh , he knew already the Roman was not merely a merchant , and the Roman knew that the Jute knew , and they both smiled the least bit . Let our leaders follow him on the sacred journey , he invited . It had just a few days left to go . Let them thereafter come dwellp170as his guests at Owldoon , as long as they wished . That was on the Great Road , an inland trade route which ran many-branched from the Skaw on south through Iron Wood into Germany . We would have no lack of passersby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . If we wanted to offer some at the seaside fair , he would arrange for their storage in a nearby community . " To be honest , " Hesting said , " I 'm afire to hear what yarns you 'll spin ! " I , seated humbly aside , was altogether charmed . Who would have looked for alertness , humor , and curiosity in a northland kinglet ? Well , who , in the depths of northland winter , would have looked for the spring to blossom ? Hesting suffered from no more than the loneliness of his country , I thought . In heart and brain , he was our kind of man  --  my kind . I wondered if I would get a chance to recite him lines of Sappho , no , Catullus , or tell him about Socrates and Alexander . The passage of Nerthus reminded me of the rites of Cybele ( and I would stare at the dolmen mounds which brooded everywhere over this landscape , and wonder half shivering what mysteries of a lost past linked the Midworld to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from village to village . At each settlement the folk came forth shouting , singing , dancing , waving newly leaved and flowering branches , the girls garlanded . There followed rites , a feast , and a sacred orgy . Next morning the king and his men went on , to spread Her blessing further that the whole realm might be made fruitful . Naturally , differences from the south were abundant , starting with those draft cows , which were tough little red beasts . Should one come in heat on the journey , she was bred in the very next place they reached . The bull was afterward killed by young men in a recklesschase and consumed , and great was the rejoicing because this year would surely be good . The wagon was large , well carpentered , painted , and goldtrimmed ; but the figures carved on it were too foreign to a Greek for me to see them as anything except grotesque . Only later would I find the powerful grace in the wood sculptures here . Upon the wagon stood a curtained shrine which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king . He , white-robed , was the driver . His warriors were acolytes and honor guard , for no one broke the peacep171of the holy season , when even outlaws might creep from the moors and be given food and shelter . The king was the priest of all vernal sacrifices and invocations . Those varied from stead to stead . In this thorp one gave a pig at the grave of its founder , in that hamlet a sheaf from the last harvest was burned  --  he knew each proceeding and conducted it with a dignity that made me , at least , feel Her veritable presence . But immediately afterward the feast was spread , an extravagance of hoarded meats and breads and fruits , beer and mead and berry wine , for this otherwise lean period ; and everybody , from the king on down , bawled in merriment . The jests , songs , and byplay got coarser as hours wore on , until at dark those who were married went by torchlight to a newly plowed field . There they formed a ring ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen by lot disrobed , and he had her virginity ; and each man and wife coupled in the furrows . The girl was considered to be made lucky , a most desirable match . But she would thereafter know none but her husband . We were told that a woman 's adultery was punished by her public scalping , clubbing , and living or half-living burial in a bog ; she had tainted the blood of the clan . Even the bachelor youths were generally celibate , only a few rich households possessing female slaves whom their scions might enjoy . " We seed our women upon the earth , that the seed in it may quicken , " Hesting explained . This was the day after we had been allowed to witness such a doing . I myself had been gripped by Her , oh , if only there had been a girl for me ! Memmius had whispered dryly in my ear that he was glad this trip would soon be over and that Resting had promised to include a concubine in his hospitality . I scarcely heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift an eyebrow . He knew better than to contradict , but his scoffing was obvious . I grew furious at him . The night before , in Hesting and the maiden I had looked upon raw beauty . That the king spoke in such a matter-of-fact voice did not lessen my respect for him . He went to his gods in the same unafraid way as he went about his daily work , or to war or sea or , at the end , death . Not that I glorify the Jutes . They are uncivilized , unlettered , stolid save when drunk or in one of the fell rages that can comep172upon them , as close to the soil and waters as their own animals and therefore almost as far from the loftiest flights of the spirit . Though their craftsmanship is excellent and their art does have that primitive strength , both are limited by crude tools and scanty choice of materials . They think themselves free men , and are in fact the slaves of uncountably many traditions and superstitions . They have no conceptof a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let alone any dream of a philosophy , a leader , or an empire that could make such betterment possible . They are physically admirable and keep themselves cleaner than I would have imagined after being in grimy Colonia ; but their sports are clumsy and unorganized , their music a high-pitched keening , their dances ridiculous . Typically , a house is a long one-room structure . Within a foundationframe of stones , walls and roof are turf supported by undressed timber , a firetrap if ever I saw any . Oriented east and west , the buildinghas latticework doors but no windows , only a louver through which a little of the smoke off the clay hearth may escape . The gloom is hardly relieved by lamps . The floor is strewn with rushes or , on special occasions , juniper boughs . At one end are clay daises , wooden stools , a weighted loom , cooking gear , food hung from rafters , personalproperty  --  living space for the entire large family . The rest of the chamber is divided into stalls for cattle and horses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place warm , and even I could get used to the stench ; but it was disconcerting to rouse at dawn  --  after a night which had begun with unmistakable sounds of copulation  --  and see a boy trot past carrying a forkful of manure for the midden outside . Ten or twenty such houses comprise a village . Around it lie the ancestral graves and the fields . Each family owns its land , but there is much collective effort , as well as a common . Nearby is a well or stream or other source of water , and usually a boulder or solitary tree or something of that kind to which small offerings are made . As for religion in the larger sense , the Jutes worship primarily the Goddess , whom they call Nerthus , more in Her aspect of the Great Mother than of that inviolable Aphrodite Whom my heart serves . Her consort is Fro . The rough wooden images of either can be seen everywhere , to my mind grossly sexual until I remembered Diana of Ephesus and the Hermae in Athens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidden to ordinary view . Duringp173the spring procession , the king is considered either to represent or to be Fro  --  the people are not inclined to draw fine logical distinctions . They have numberless local divinities , tutelaries , and oracles . In addition , as I began to master the language and converse with folk , I heard about Danish gods and saw propitiations of them . These seemed to be principally the warlike three called by the Romans Mars , Jupiter , and Mercury . The Romans are forever making such naive identifications . I am far from sure that Tiwu , Thunarr , and Wothen really correspond that closely , not to speak of other deities . At any rate , Nerthus and Fro are the aboriginal Powers of land and sea , fertility and fisheries . The Danes put most of their pantheon in heaven and make them lords of war . As they and the Jutes come increasingly into contact , however hostile , more and more men on either side are deeming it wise to pay respects to the gods associated with the opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't aim to truckle to Wothen Psychopompos , " he stated . His manner was calm as ever . " Maybe , in time , we can reach an understanding of sorts with the Danes , and thus with their gods . Meanwhile I am Fro 's , and Hers , and mainly my people 's . " We were riding down the Great Road , approaching Owldoon , his home . The rutted , muddy , rain-puddled path was no legionary highway . Yet it ran for hundreds of miles to join ancient routes in the east of Europe , and along it had gone amber , bronze , furs , glass , slaves , hopes for more centuries than man has kept count of . Here we were somewhat east of the middle of the peninsula , upon its spine . High banks on either side bore grass , daisies , ferns , dandelions like blobs of gold , briar , crab apple , blackthorn , wild cherry . Above was a thin forest , murky fir , palely budding willow , shuddering aspen . It was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensity . A drizzle enclosed my sight ; mists smoked over the earth ; my garments clung clammy to my skin . Memmius hung back among the guardsmen who followed the wagon and those sailors who accompaniedus . The latter were few . They would transport our goods to Owldoon . On their return , the ship would raise anchor  --  no sense in letting her lie idle  --  to call for us a year hence . By that time , Memmius hoped to have founded a permanent trading post , with a factor responsibleto him . Until then , he and I were the only ones whom **26;2151;TOOLONG and pseudolizard vanished down one link of the toothed branch . It was close to noon . Occasional shafts of light reached the Third Level , some digging even deeper to the Fourth and Fifth . Mirror vines shone everywhere , their diamond-shaped reflective leaves bouncing the sun and sending life-giving light ricocheting hundreds of meters down green canyons to places it otherwise would never reach . Noontimewas the crescendo of the hylaeal symphony . Comb vines and resonatorsformed a verdant vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have astonished a curious botanist , as would the mirror vines . Born was no botanist . He could not have defined the term . But his **41;2179;TOOLONG could have . That knowledge had not kept him from dying young , however . Eventually the damp night mist slid about them with feline stealth . The cheerful raucousness of the creatures of light gave way to the sounds of awakening nightlings , whose grunts were darker and deeper , their cries closer to hysteria , the booming howls of the nocturnal carnivoresa touch more menacing . It was time to find shelter . Born had spent much of the last hour searching for a wild Hometree . Such trees were rare and he had encountered none this afternoon . They would have to settle for less accommodating temporary quarters . One such lay ten meters overhead , easily reached through the interwovenpathways of the forest canopy . What disease or parasite had caused the great woody galls to form on the branch of the Pillar tree neither Born nor Ruumahum could guess , but they were grateful for their presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seven of the globular eruptions were clustered together on the branch . The smallest was half Born 's size , the largest more than spacious enough to accommodate man and furcot . He tested the biggest with his knife , found it far too tough for the sharpened bone  --  just as he had hoped . If his skinning blade could not penetrate the woody gall , the chances of some predator coming in on them from behind were small . He untied the dead grazer  --  it was alreadybeginning to smell  --  from Ruumahum 's back , slid the hulk onto the branch . Ruumahum stretched delightedly , fur rippling as the musclesin his back popped . He yawned , revealing multiple canines and two razor-sharp lower tusks . Under Born 's direction , the furcot went to work on the gall withp11both forepaws , ripping open nearly all of one side . Together they wrestled the carcass into the cavity . Working carefully and smoothly , Born tied his remaining jacari thorns into the length of vine until they formed a crude barricade across the opening . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pricking . The barbed thorns crisscrossed the opening neatly . An intelligent scavenger could work around them easily , but they would stop anything that was not a man . Their kill safely secured for the night , Ruumahum went to work on the gall next in line , cutting a smaller opening in it for them to enter . Born knelt , peered inside . It was long dead  --  dry and black . As he entered , he pulled a packet of red dust from his belt ; Ruumahum was alreadyscraping some of the dust-dry gall lining into a pile near the opening they had made . Born poured a little of the red powder on a thin scrap of wood and pressed his thumb into it . A few seconds of contact with his body heat was enough to cause the dust pile to explode in flame just as the hunter withdrew his thumb . The incendiarypollen served as an especially effective form of defense against a certain parasitic tuber . Born 's people had discovered its usefulness the hard way . He built the tiny blaze into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead floor of the gall . Its dance and crackle was a great comfortin the blackness of night . Only one more thing to do . He had to shake Ruumahum violently to awaken him long enough to cut a tiny hole two-thirds of the way up the far side of the gall . Circulation and smoke exit assured , Born took a piece of dark jerky from his belt pouch and chewed at the spicy , rock-hard meat . The evening rain began . It would rain all night  --  not an occasional downpour , but a steady , even rain that would cease two hours before dawn . With few exceptions , it had rained every night Born could recall . As sure as the sun rose in the morning , the rain came down at night . Water drummed steadily on the roof of the gall , flowed down its curved sides to drip away to depths unseen . Ruumahum was fast asleep . Born studied the fire for several minutes . Putting the rest of the jerky away for the next night , he nestled himself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pressing against the inner wall of the gall , his head curved into his chest . Born sighed , stared at the solid wall of blackness beyond the fire . He was satisfied . They had met no scavengers on this first day of return , and Ruumahum had handled the massive load of the great grazer without falling asleepp12even once . He stroked the furcot 's fur appreciatively , running his fingers through the thick green coat . A warm , dry shelter for the night , too . Many nights spent in wetness made him appreciate the dry gall . Pulling the green fur cloak tightly about him , he turned on his side . His knife was close to his right hand , the snuffler ready at his feet . Relatively content and more or less confident of not waking up in the belly of some nightcrawler , he fell into a sound , dreamless sleep . It had been a fairly hard rain , Born reflected as he stared out through the hole cut in the gall . Behind him , Ruumahum slept on oblivious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Left to his own devices , a furcot would sleep all but a few hours a day . Droplets still fell from the green sky above , though the rain had long since ceased . A couple struck Born in the face . He shook the tepid moisture away . Walking would be slippery and uncertain for a while , but they would start immediately anyway . He was anxious to be Home . Anxious to see the look on Brightly Go 's face when he dumped the grazer at her feet . Rising , he booted Ruumahum in the ribs a couple of times . The furcotmoaned . Born repeated the action . Ruumahum got to his feet two at a time , grumbling irritably . " Already morning . . . ? " " Long day 's march , Ruumahum , " Born told him . " Long rain last night . There should be red berries and pium out before midday . " Ruumahum brightened at the thought of food . He would have preferred to sleep , but . . . plum , now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and pulling , digging eight parallel grooves into the alloy-tough dead base of the gall . Persons , he had to admit , were sometimes useful to have around . They had a way of finding good things to eat and making the very eating more enjoyable . For such rewards Ruumahum was willing to overlook Born 's other faults . His triple pupils brightened . Humans flattered themselves with the idea that they had done an awesome job of domesticating the first furcots . The furcots saw no need to dispute this . The reality of it was that they had stuck with the persons out of curiosity . Human persons were the first beings the furcots had ever encountered who were unpredictableenough to keep them awake . One could never quite predict what a person might do  --  even one 's own person . So they kept up the pactp13without really understanding why , knowing only that in the relationshipthere was something worthwhile and good . Keeping hearts of pium in mind enabled Ruumahum to arrange the grazer carcass on his back without falling asleep more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious time . Either no scavenger had blundered into their camp , or else they had elected not to risk those deadly interlocking thorns . Born recovered all the vine-entwined jacaris , and reset the poison darts in the bottom of his quiver , looped the vine around his belt , and started off again . " Close Home , " Ruumahum muttered that evening , pausing to send a thick curving tongue out to groom the back of a forepaw . Born had been recognizing familiar landmarks and tree blazes for over an hour . There was the stormtreader tree that had killed old Hannahin an unwary moment . They gave the black and silver bole a wide berth . Once they had to pause as a Buna floater drifted by , trailing long stinging tentacles . As they waited , the floater let out a long sibilant whistle and dropped lower , perhaps to try its luck on the Fourth Level where scampering bushackers were more common . Born had stepped out from behind a trunk and was about to remove his cloak when above them sounded a shriek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howl of Chollakee hunting . So sudden , so overpowering was the scream that the normally imperturbable Ruumahum was shocked into a defensive posture , backing up against the nearest bole despite the restrictive mass of the grazer , forepaws upraised and claws extended . The scream dropped to a moan that was abruptly subsumed by an overpowering , frightening roar of crackings and snappings . Even the branch of the nearby Pillar tree shook . Then the branch they stood on rocked fiercely . With his great strength , Ruumahum was able to maintainhis perch , but Born was not so secure . He fell several meters , smashing through a couple of helpless succulents before he hit an unyielding protrusion . He started to bounce off it before he got both arms locked around the stiff fom . The vibrating stopped , and he was able to get his legs around it , too . Shaking , he pulled himself up . Nothing felt broken , and everything seemed to work . But his snuffler was gone ; its restraining tie had snapped , sending it bouncing and spinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crashing and breaking sounds faded , finally stopped . As he had fallen , Born thought he had seen in the distance through the green anp14impossibly wide mass of something blue and metallic . It had passed as swiftly as he had fallen . As he stared that way now there was nothing to be seen but the forest . Peepers and orbioles came out of hiding , called hesitantly into the silence . Then bushackers and flowerkits and their relatives joined in . In minutes the hylaea sounded and resounded normally again . " Something has happened , " Ruumahum ventured softly . " I think I saw it . " Born stared harder , still saw only what belonged . " Did you ? Something big and blue and shining . " Ruumahum eyed him steadily . " Saw nothing . Saw self falling to Hell and gone . Concentrated on staying here with grazer weight pulling there . No time for curious-looking . " " You did better than I , old friend , " Born admitted , as he climbed up toward the furcot . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in the direction of the murderous sounds . " I think we 'd better  --  " " No . " A glance over his shoulder showed the furcot with his great head lowered and moving slowly from side to side in imitation of the human gesture of negation . Three eyes rolled toward the path they had been following . " So far , lucky be we , person Born . Soon though , others grazer to smell will begin . We will fight have to every step to Home . To Home go first . This other "  --  and he nodded in the direction of the breaking and crashing  --  " I would talk of first with the brethren , who know such things quickly . " Born stood thinking on the woody bridge . His intense curiosity  --  or madness , if one believed many of his fellows  --  pulled him toward the source of the sounds , however threatening they had been . For a change , reason overcame . Ruumahum and he had been through much in the killing and carrying of the grazer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsound thinking . " Okay , Ruumahum . " He hopped back onto the bigger branch and started toward the village again . A last look over his shoulder still showed only speckled greenery and no unnatural movement . " But as soon as the meat 's disposed of , I 'm coming back to find out what that was , whether or not you or anyone else comes with me . " " Doubt it not , " Ruumahum replied knowingly.  |p15They  reached the barrier well before darkness . In front of them , the hylaea seemed to become a single tree  --  the Home-tree . Only the Pillars themselves were bigger , and the Home-tree was a monstrously big tree for certain . Broad twisting branches and vines-of-own shot out in all directions . Air-trees and cubbles and lianas grew in and about the tree 's own growth . Born noted with satisfaction that only plants which were innocuous or helpful to the Home-tree grew on it . His peoplekept the Home-tree well and , in turn , the Home-tree kept them . The vines-of-own were lined with flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within them . These pods were akin to the yellow tank seeds that made the snufflers such deadly weapons , but far more sensitive . A single touch on the sensitive pink surface would cause the paper-thin skin to rupture , sending a cloud of dust into the air that would kill any animal inhaling it , whether through nostril , pore , or other air exchanger . The vines entangled and crossed the tree in the middle of the Third Level  --  the village level  --  forming a protecfivenet of deadly ropes around it . Born approached the nearest , leaned over and spat directly into the center of one of the blossoms , avoiding the pod . The blossom quivered , but the pod did not burst . The pink petals closed in on themselves . A pause , then the vines began to curl and tighten like climbing vines hunting for a better purchase . As they retracted , a clear path was formed through which Born and Ruumahum strode easily . Even as Ruumahum was through , the outermost vines were already relaxing once again , expanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom into which Born had spat opened its petals once more to the faint evening light . A casual observer would note that Born 's saliva had disappeared . A chemist would be able to tell that it had been absorbed . A brilliant scientistmight be able to discover that it had been more than absorbed  --  it had been analyzed and identified . Born knew only that carefully spitting into the bloom seemed to tell the Home-tree who he was . As he walked toward the village proper he tried to whistle happily . The song died aborning . His mind was occupied with the mysteriousp16blue thing that had come crashing down into the forest . Rarely , one of the greater air-trees would overreach its rootings , or overgrow its perch , and fall , bringing down creepers and lesser growths with it . But never had Born heard such a smashing and shattering of wood . This thing had been far heavier than any air-tree . He knew that by the speed with which it had fallen . And there was that half familiar , metallicgleam . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village center . Here , the enormous trunk of the Home-tree split into a webbing of lesser boles , forming an interlocking net of wood around a central open space , before joining and growing together high above to form once more a single tapering trunk that rose skyward for another sixty meters . With vines and plant fibers and animal skins the villagers had closed off sections of the interweaving trunklets to form homes and rooms impervious to casual rain and wind . For food , the Hometreeoffered cauliflorous fruits shaped like gourds , tasting like cranberry , which sometimes grew within the sealed-off homes themselves . Small scorched places lay within the houses and beneath the canopy in the central square . These minute burns did not affect the enormous growth . Each home also possessed a pit dug into the wood itself . Here , many times daily , the inhabitants of the tree offered thanks for its shelter and protection , mixing their offerings with a mulch of pulpy plants gathered for the purpose . The mulch also served to kill strong odors . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residue was thrown over the side of the Home-tree into the green depths , so that the pits could be used again . For the tree accepted and absorbed the offerings with great speed and matchless efficiency . The Home-tree was the greatest discovery made by Born 's ancestors . Its unique characteristics were discovered when it seemed that the few surviving colonists would perish . At that time no one wondered why a growth unutilized by native life should prove so accommodatingto alien interlopers . When the population made a comeback , scouts were sent out to search for other Home-trees , and a new tribe was planted . But in the years since Born 's **43;2222;TOOLONG settled in this tree , contact with other tribes had first dwindled and then stopped altogether . None bothered to reopen such contact , or cared . They had all they could do to survive in a world that seethed with fiendish forms of malignancy . " Born is back . . . look , Born has returned . . . Born , Born ! " A small crowd gathered around him , welcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , ignoring the respect due a returning hunter , had the temerity to tug at his cloak . He looked down , recognized the orphan boy Din who was cared for in common . His mother and father had been taken one day , while they were on a fruit-gathering expedition , by something that had coughed once horriblyand vanished into the forest . The rest of the party had fled in panic and later returned to find only the couple 's tools . No sign of them had ever been found . So the boy was raised by everyone in the village . For reasons unknown to anyone , least of all to Born , the youngster had attachedhimself to him . The hunter could not cast the youth away . It was a law  --  and a good law for survival  --  that a free child could make parents of any and all it chose . Why one would pick mad Born , though .. . " No , you can not have the grazer pelt , " Born scolded , as he gently shoved the boy away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . He was no longer pushed so easily . Following at the orphan 's heels was a fat ball of fur not quite as big as the adolescent . The furcot cub Muf tripped over its own stubby legs every third step . The third time he tripped , he lay down in the middle of the village and went to sleep , this being an appropriate solution to the problem . Ruumahum eyed the cub , mumbled disapprovingly . But he could sympathize . He was quite ready for an extended nap himself . Born did not head directly for his home , but instead walked across the village to another 's . " Brightly Go ! " Green eyes that matched the densest leaves peeked out , followed by the face and form of a wood nymph supple as a kitten . She walked over to take both his hands in hers . " It 's good that you 're back , Born . Everyone worried . I . . worried , much . " " Worried ? " he responded jovially . " About a little grazer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the carcass . Beneath its great mass Ruumahum fumed and had unkind thoughts about persons who engaged in frivolous activities before considering the comfort of their furcot . Brightly Go stared at the grazer and her eyes grew big as ruby-inkindblossoms . Then she frowned with uncertainty . " But Born , I ca n't possibly eat all that ! " Born 's answering laughter was only slightly forced . " You can havep18what you need of the meat , and your parents , too . It 's the pelt that 's for you , of course . " Brightly Go was the most beautiful girl in the village , but sometimes Born found himself thinking unflattering things about her other qualities . Then , he would eye her thin wrapping of leaffeather and forget everything else . " You 're laughing at me , " she protested angrily . " Do n't laugh at me ! " Naturally , that encouraged him to laugh even more . " Losting , " she said with dignity , " does n't laugh at me . " That shut him up quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he shot back challengingly . " It matters to me . " " Huh . . . well . " Something had suddenly gone wrong somewhere . This was n't working out the way he had imagined it would , the way he had planned it . Somehow it never did . He looked around the silent village . A few of the older people had stared out at him when he had returned . Now that the novelty of his survival had worn off , they had returned to their household tasks . Most of the active adults , naturally , were off hunting , gathering edibles , or keeping the Home clear of parasites . The anticipated adulationhad never materialized . He had risked his life , then , to return to acluster of curious children and to the indifference of Brightly Go . Hisearlier euphoria vanished . " I 'll clean the pelt for you , anyway , " he grumbled . " Come on , Ruumahum . " He turned and stalked angrily off toward the other side of the village . Behind him Brightly Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum of emotions . Then she turned and went back inside her parents ' compound . Ruumahum let out a snort of relief when the dead weight was finally untied and he could shake it from his back . Whereupon he walked directly to his corner in the large single room , lay down , and entered that region most beloved of all furcots . Muttering to himself Born unpacked his hunter 's pouch-belt , removed his cloak , and set about the business of preparing the grazer . He wielded the bone knife so angrily he almost cut through and ruined the skin several times . The layer of fat beneath the skin was next . Turning the carcass was a laborious job , but Born managed without having to wake Ruumahum . The fat was slung into a wooden trough . Later it would be melted down and rendered into candles . Then he was at the meat , cutting away huge chunks to dry and preserve.  |p19Organs  and other nonedibles went into the pit at the back of the room . This he covered with the ready mulch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home would be pleased . The hollow backbone and the huge flaring circular ribs he separated , cleaned and scoured , and set outside where the sunlight would dry them . The thick bone would make tools and ornaments . The teeth were valueless , not worth wearing , unlike those of the carnivorous breeder Losting had killed . He would make no necklace of these flat , grinding molars to wear at ceremonies . But he would eat well . Once the grazer had been reduced to its useful components , Born cleaned his hands and arms . Moving to a corner he pulled aside a curtainof woven fiber . Rummaging behind it he found his other snuffler . He would have to secure a second one now . He studied it and thought over the problem . He would get Jhelum to make one . His hands were far more skillful at working the green wood than Born 's , and quicker . He smiled slightly . He would lose most of his grazer in trade for the new snuffler , but he would still have good eating for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had two youngsters and a wife , would be appreciative of the meat . " I am going to see Jhelum , the carver , Ruumahum . I 'll  --  ' A long low whistling came from the furcot 's corner . Born uttered an angry word . It seemed no one cared whether he lived or died . He ripped the leafleather screen aside and marched off toward Jhelum 's place . Most of the remainder of the day was taken up in working out the arrangements of the exchange . In the end , Jhelum agreed to prepare the new snuffler in return for three-fourths of the grazer meat and the whole skeleton . Ordinarily Born would never have gone so high . He had worked nearly a week to get the grazer , and taking such prey involveduncommon risk to life . But he was tired , frustrated by the indifferent reception , and confused by Brightly Go . Besides , Jhelum showed him an exquisite section of green wood pipe , almost blue in spots , that could be used for the weapon . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but neither would he get a bargain . He climbed alone into the upper reaches of the village , to where trunklets started to rejoin to form a single bole . From there he could look back at the village and out at the forest wall . The village center was the largest open space he had ever seen in his life , save for the Upper Hell , of course . Here he could relax and studyp20the world without fear of attack . As he watched , a glass flitter touched down alongside a pink vines-of-own blossom . Red and blue wings flutteredlazily , the sun shining through the transparent organic panes . This was something else that prompted some in the village to call Born a little mad . Only he sat and wasted his time watching things like flitters and flowers , which could neither nourish nor kill . Born himself did not know why he did such things , but something within him was gratified when he did . Gratified and warmed . He would learn all there was to know about everything . Reader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demon that drove Born to such wastefulness , and had failed as many times . Born had submitted to such ministrations only at the urgings of the worried chief couple , Sand and Joyla . Eventually , Reader had given up , pronouncing Born 's aberrations incurable . As long as he harmed no one , all agreed to let Born alone . All wished him well . All save Losting , naturally . But Losting 's dislike had its roots not in Born 's aberrations , but in one of his obsessions . A drop of lukewarm rain hit Born on the forehead , trickled down his face . It was followed by another and more . It was time to join the council . He made his way back through the trunklets into the village . The fire had been lit in the center of the square on the place scorched tough and black by many such fires . A broad canopy of woven leafleather kept the rain off and there was room beneath for all the villagers . Alreadymost of the people were assembled , Sand , Joyla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down through the now steady rain , he spotted Losting . Entering the circle , Born took his place among the men opposite his rival . Losting had apparently learned of Born 's return and his offer of the grazer pelt , for he glared with more venom than usual across the fire at him . Born smiled back . The steady patter of warm rain falling on the leafleather and drippingto the wood-ground murmured in counterpoint to the sounds of the assembled people . Occasionally a child laughed , to be shushed by his elders . Sand raised an arm for silence . Beside him , Joyla did likewise . The people became quiet . Sand , who had never been a big man  --  perhaps about Born 's size  --  now , shrunken and bent with age , appeared even smaller . Nevertheless , his presence was still impressive . He was like ap21weathered old clock that spent all its time patiently , solemnly ticking , but struck startlingly loud and clear at the necessary moment . " The hunting was good , " someone reported . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The gathering has been good , " Sand intoned . " The gathering has been good , " the chorus agreed readily . " All who were here last are here now , " Sand observed , staring around the circle . " The sap runs strong in the Home . " " The faring of the ready pod , " announced one of the women in the circle . " The seed of Morann and Oh ripens . She will ripen within the month . " Sand and everyone else nodded or murmured approval . Somewhere far above , thunder pealed , echoed down cellulose canyons , rolled off chlorophyllous cliffs . The evening litany droned on : how much and what kinds of fruit and nuts gathered ; how much of what kinds of meat killed and cured ; the experiences and accomplishmentsand failures of each member of the tribe for that day now past . There was an appreciative , admiring murmur from the crowd when Born announced the taking of the grazer , but it was not as strong as he had wished . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paramount in everyone 's mind . It was for Reader to bring it up . " This afternoon , " he began , gesturing with his totem of office , the holy axe , " something came out of the Upper Hell into the world . Something gigantic beyond imagining  --  " " No , not beyond imagining , " Joyla interrupted . " It must be assumedthe Pillars are greater . " Appreciative mutters sounded in agreement . " Well considered , Joyla , " Reader admitted . " Something for its size , heavy beyond imagining , then , " and this time he looked satisfied as Joyla remained silent . " It entered the world northwest of the stormtreaderand passed on to the Lower Hell . Probably it was a denizen of that Hell visiting its cousins in the Upper , and it has returned now to its home . " " Might we not be wrong about the demons of the Upper ? " someone in the crowd ventured . " Might they not in truth grow as large as those below ? We know little enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " someone else put in , " have no desire to know more ! " There was sympathetic laughter . " Nevertheless , " the shaman insisted , gesturing with the axe at the dweller who had preferred his comfortable ignorance , " this particularp22demon chose to descend near to us . What if it has not returned to its home in the depths ? It has made no sound or movement since its arrival . If it remains near us , who can say what it might do ? " There were nervous stirrings in the crowd . " There is a chance it might be dead . While the opportunity to inspect a dead demon would be interesting , so much meat would be more valuable . " " Unless its relatives come around to claim its corpse , " someone shouted , " in which case I 'd rather be elsewhere ! " There were mutters of agreement . Lightning crackled above the tallest emergent , and thunder rolled down to them again . To his amazement Born found himself suddenly on his feet , speaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a mass shifting of bodies as all eyes came to focus on him . The abrupt attention made him acutely uncomfortable , but he held his ground . " How do you know ? Did you see the thing ? " Reader finally asked , recovering from Born 's unexpected pronouncement . " You said nothing of this to anyone . " Born shrugged , tried to sound casual about it . " No one rushed to ask me about it . " " If it was not a demon , this thing you say you saw , then what was it ? " asked Losting suspiciously . Born hesitated . " I do not know . I had but the briefest glimpse of it as it fell through the world  --  but see it I did ! " Losting sat back in his place , his muscles rippling in the firelight , and smiled at those near him . " Come , Born , " prompted Joyla , " either you saw the thing or you did n't . " " But that is exactly it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it , yet did not . As the breaking sounds and shaking of the world reached its peak , I saw a flash of deep blue through the trees . Shining bright blue , like that of an asanis . " " Maybe that 's what you saw , a drifting asanis bloom , " Losting said with a smirk . " No ! " Born spun to glare angrily across at his rival . " It was that color , but brilliant , deep , and too .. , too sharp . It threw back the light . " " Threw back the light ? " wondered Reader . " How could this be ? " How could it ? They were all staring at him , half wanting to believe he had seen something that was not a demon . He struggled to recall that instant of falling , that glimpse of alien blue among the branches.  |p23It  caught the light like an asanis leaf  --  no , more like his knife when it was polished . His eyes roved absently as he thought furiously for something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he blurted , pointing dramatically to the weapon dangling in the shaman 's hand . " It was like the axe . " Everyone 's gaze automatically shifted to the holy weapon , Reader 's included . Soft whispers of derision sprang up . Nothing was like the axe . " Perhaps you are mistaken , Born , " Sand ventured gently . " It did , as you say , happen very fast . And you were falling when you saw it . " " I 'm positive about it , sir . Just like the axe . " He wished he was as certain as he tried to sound , but he could not back down on his story now without sounding like a complete fool . " In any case , " he found himself saying , to his horror , " it is a simple enough matter to prove . We need only go and look . " The mutterings from the crowd grew louder ; they were no longer derisive , but shocked . " Born , " the chief began patiently , " we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . It may have already returned to the depths from which it probably came . Let it stay there . " " But we do n't know , " objected Born , leaving his place to stand close by the fire . " Maybe it has n't returned . Maybe it 's down only a level or so , sleeping , waiting to catch the scent of the Home to come seeking us one by one in the night . If it is such a monster , then we would do better to seek it out first and slay it as it sleeps . " Sand nodded slowly , stared around at the people . " Very well . Who will go with Born to sniff out the trail of this demon ? " Born turned to look at his fellow hunters , silently imploring . Long silence , defiant stares . Then , startlingly , a response came from an unexpected quarter . " I will go , " Losting announced . He stood and stared smugly across at Born as if to say , if you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be afraid of . Born did not meet the other man 's eyes . Reluctant assent came from the hunter Drawn and the twins Talltreeand Tailing . The other hunters would eventually have given in and agreed out of fear of appearing cowardly , but Reader raised the axe . " It is enough . I will go , too , despite my better judgment . It is not appropriate that men should visit one of the damned without an authorityon damnation . "  | " That 's for sure , " someone muttered . The laughter this provoked was a welcome release from the solemnity of the proceedings . Sand put a hand over his mouth delicately to hide an unchiefly chuckle . " Now let us pray , " he intoned forcefully , " that those who seek out the demon shall find him sickly and weak , or not find him at all , and return to us whole and sound . " He raised both hands , lowered his head , and commenced a chant . No Earthly theological authority would have recognized that chant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have identified its source or inspiration though any bioengineer could . What none of them could have explained was why this chant seemed so effective there under the crying night sky and leafleather canopy . Triple orbs glowed like hot coals , reflecting the dance of the distant flickering fire . Ruumahum lay in the crook in the branches and stared down doubtfully at the gathered people . His muzzle rested on crossed forepaws . A clumsy scratching and clawing sounded on the limb alongside his resting place . A moment later , forty kilos of awkwardly propelled fur and flesh crashed into his flank . He growled irritably and glanced back . It was the cub who had attached itself to the orphan young person , Din . " Old one , " Muf queried softly , " why are you not at rest like the others of the brethren ? " Ruumahum turned his gaze back to the distant leafleather canopy and the chanting humans beneath . " I study Man , " he murmured . " Go to sleep , cubling . " Muf considered , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the fire . After a pause , he looked up questioningly . " What are they doing ? " " I am not certain , " Ruumahum replied . " I believe in some ways they are trying to become like the brethren . . . like us . " " Us ? Us ? " Muf coughed comically in the rain and sat back on his several haunches . " But I thought we strive to become like the per-sons ? " " So it is believed . Now , go to sleep , shoot ! " " Please , old one , I am confused . If Man is trying to become like us and we are trying to become like Man  --  then who is right ? " " You ask many questions , cub , you do not fully understand . How can you expect to understand the answer ? The answer is . . . Thatp25Which-Is-Sought , a meeting , a conjoinment , a concatenation , an interwovenweb . " " I see , " whispered Muf , not seeing at all . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know , " Ruumahum replied , looking back to the fire . " None of the brethren know , but we seek it anyway . Besides , Man finds us interesting and useful and believes himself master . The brethren find Man useful and interesting and care not about mastering . Man thinks he understands this relationship . We know we do not . For this contented ignorance we envy him . " He nodded in the direction of the assembled persons below . " We may never understand it . Revelation is never promised , only hoped for . " " I understand , " murmured the cub , not understanding at all . He struggled awkwardly to his feet and turned to go , then paused to look back . " Old one , one more question . " " What is it ? " Ruumahum grumbled , not turning his gaze from the prayer gathering . " It is rumored among the cubs that we neither spoke nor thought till the persons came . " " That is no rumor , budding , that is truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razorlike teeth and tusks . " But so did Man . We wake together , it is thought . " " I know , " Muf admitted , not knowing at all . He turned and rambled off to find a sleeping place for the night . Ruumahum turned his attention to the persons once more , consideredhow fortunate he was to have a person as interesting and unpredictable as Born . Now there was this new thing they would go out to find tomorrow . Well , if the world was to change tomorrow , he thought as he yawned , it was better to face change having had a good night 's sleep . He rolled over on his side , tucked his head between foreandmidpaws , and went instantly and peacefully to that country . Born was all for starting before the morning mist had lifted but Reader and the others would not hear of it . Losting viewed the originatorof such a preposterous , dangerous idea with pity . Anyone who would even consider moving about the world in mist , when a man could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was right on top of him , had to be more than a little crazy . There were twelve in the party -- six men and six furcots . The men traveled in single file through the treeways , while the furcots spreadp26out above , below , and on both sides , forming a protective cordon around the persons . Born and Reader shared the lead , while Losting , by choice , guarded the rear . The big man had mixed feelings about this expedition and was striving to stay as far away from its originator  --  Born  --  as possible . Besides , as much as he disliked Born for the other 's interest in Brightly Go , Losting was not so stupid that he failed to recognize Born 's skills . As such , Born belonged in the lead . But then , Losting told himself comfortingly , the mad are always clever . Their progress through the sunny Third Level branchings was rapid and uninterrupted . Only once did distant warning growls , from the left of their course and below , cause the party to pause and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds , appeared a short while later on the cubble running parallel to the persons ' path . He was panting slightly and puffing with anger . " Brown many-legs , " the furcot reported . " A mated hunting pair . Saw me and the she spat , but her mate turned her . Gone now . " The furcot turned , leaped to a lower branch , and disappeared in the undergrowth . Reader nodded with satisfaction and waved the column forward . Thorns were returned to , Born reflected . A mated hunting pair would take on almost anything in the hylaea . But a group of men and furcots in such numbers would cause even the greater forest carnivores to think twice before attacking . Whether a demon would think likewise remained to be seen . They must be nearing the place . Born recognized a distinctive Blood tree , its pitcherlike leaves filled with crimson water caused by the plant 's secretion of tannin . Soon after passing the Blood tree they found themselves walking into a steady breeze . A responsive murmur sprang up among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily in any single direction . Instead , gusts of air came and went like wraiths , darting and curling around branches and boles and stems like living things . But this breeze was steady and purposefuland warm . Warm enough , Born reflected , to come from Hell itself . Reader brandished his axe , defying any evil spirits in the area who would dare come near . Each man pulled his green cloak more tightly and protectively around him . Born motioned the party to slow and spread out . Ahead of him the world seemed suddenly to change perspective . He took another couple of steps along the cubble , pushed aside a drooping whalear leaf , andp27cried out at what he saw , one hand tightening convulsively around a supporting liana . Similar cries sounded nearby , but he was momentarilyparalyzed , unable to look for his companions . Not a hand 's breadth away the thick wood of the cubble he stood on had been shattered like a rotten stem , as had that of other lesser and greater growths nearby . A vast well had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up , to a circle of strange color two hundred meters overhead . A patch of deep blue flecked with white cumulus  --  the blue of the Upper Hell . Below  --  he gripped the liana ever tighter  --  below and down an equally great distance , somewhere at the Fifth Level , lay a brilliant blue object that caught the sun like the axe . In its center was somethingeven more shiny , something that made rainbows from sunlight , an uneven half-globe of material like a Hitter 's transparent wings . Its top was ragged and open to the air . Already vines , creepers , cubbles , tuntangcles , and other growth were destroying the smooth sides of the well , pushing outward in furious competition for the unaccustomed sunlight . Born studied the spreading epiphytes and rampaging growers and estimated that in another twice seven-days the new vegetation would cover the well completely . They would have to avoid this area for some time , however , until some denser growth filled it in . " Here , Born ! " a voice called . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pillar , leaning out as far as he dared and gesturing with the axe . It flashed like lightning in the greenish light . In a few minutes every member of the party had assembled on the meters-wide broken branch . The furcotshad gathered to themselves and sat silently on one side to see what the persons would do . " It is a demon for sure , and it sleeps , " began one of the twins  --  Talltree , Born noted . " I still do not think it is a demon , " Born countered firmly . " I believe it is a thing , an object that has been fashioned , " and he nodded toward Reader , " like the axe . " Various exclamations greeted Born 's opinion as if it were blasphemy . Reader held up a hand for quiet . " People , this is no place for loud noises . The demons of the Upper Hell could surely come down to this place through the hole the larger demon has made . We will discuss this matter further , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in whispers . " Now then , Born , " continuedp28Reader , " what makes you so certain this blue thing below us is not a demon , but an object made like the axe ? " " It has the look of it , " Born replied . " Notice how regular are its outlines and the way it throws back the light . " " Might not a demon do this as well ? Does not the skin of the orbiolethrow back the light ? Are you certain , Born ? " Born found himself looking away . " There is no way to be sure , shaman , save , " and he stared across at the older man , " to go down to it and see for oneself . " " But if it is a demon ? " Drawn wondered loudly , " and it sleeps , and our pokings awaken it ? " The hunter rose from his squatting position , holding his snuffler firmly . " No , friend Born . I respect your guessings and honor your skill , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two children and I 'm not ready to go knocking on the skull of a demon to see if anyone is home . No , not I. " He paused , thinking . " But , I will consider what the shaman and my brothers say . " " What say the hunters , then ? " asked Reader . The other twin spoke . " Truly , it may be as Born says . Be it only a made thing , with no life in it , then it seems to me no threat to the Home . Or it may be , as Drawn says , a sleeping demon waiting only for some careless person to stumble blindly in and waken it . If we leave it alone it may sleep forever , or go peacefully on its way . Myself , I think it is a demon of a new kind , one injured in its fall from the Upper Hell . We must leave and not disturb it , but let it die in peace , lest it arise in anger and destroy us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimesone of the twins would begin a sentence and the other would finish it . They did this without looking at one another , which was not , surprising , for in the forest does one branch of a tree have to consultwith another before putting out leaves ? There were some who thought the twins more of the forest than of Man . " Whatever it is , shaman , " Talltree concluded , it seems we havenothing to lose by leaving it undisturbed and everything to gain by returningHome quietly the way we came . " " Do n't you care about it at all ? " Born asked openly . " Are n't you atall curious ? Do you not care if it is a benign demon ? " " I 've never heard of a helpful demon and I care only about surviving , " Drawn responded . The others listened attentively . After Born , Drawn was the most skillful hunter in the village . " As it lies "  --  he nod/ded toward the world-well  --  " it threatens us not , nor the Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I vote to return Home . " " I also . .. and I ... and I. . . " The word passed around the little circle of persons in the trees , and it was all against Born . Always against Born , he thought , furious . " Go back , then , " he shouted disgustedly , moving from the circle to a higher branch . " I 'll go down alone . " The other hunters muttered . Reader and Drawn , the eldest among them , looked sympathetic , but they agreed that Born had not yet acquired caution to match his other abilities . The village would miss him if he failed to return . If he would go , let him go , but do not match madness with him . So Born crouched alone on his higher limb and pouted while his companions made themselves ready . Their furcots fanning out around them , they started down the cubble toward the Home . Despite his feelings , he was half tempted to join them and try furthertalk . Only Losting 's barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pium fruit more than to see Born vanish forever , leaving him a clear path to Brightly Go . But Born would not vanish so conveniently . He would learn the truth of the blue monster below and return to tell of it to all . The others who had left would be ashamed , and Brightly Go would smile favoringly on him . Still , it was to be considered that there had been only brave men in the little group , and that wise Reader was not an idiot . There still existed the chance he was wrong and everyone else was right . He put aside this unpleasant possibility and whistled once , softly . Ruumahum appeared in a minute , the small branch sagging under their combined weight . The furcot eyed him expectantly , promptly crossed all four front paws and went to sleep . Born studied the massiveform absently before turning his attention to the right . There , past a few thick fronds and several dangling vines , lay the pit open to the Upper Hell . At the bottom of the pit lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not quite alone . He whacked Ruumahum along one side of his head , a blow that would have jolted a large man . The furcot merely blinked , yawned , and started preening itself with a forepaw . " Up and out , " Born said firmly . Ruumahum stared at him drowsily . " What to do ? " " Come , good for nothing . I want a close look at the blue thing . " Ruumahum snorted . Did n't the person have two perfectly good eyesp30of his own ? But he conceded that Born was right . Someone would have to watch the open spaces above and to the sides while Born was exposed in the clearing . Born crawled , alone , without loaded snufflers to back him up , without ironwood spears to reinforce his confidence , to the edge of the pit and stared downward . The glistening blue circle lay as before . It had not moved and showed no sign of moving . Even as he watched , a loud crackling sounded , and the object appeared to drop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testament to its great weight , and it seemed to be sinking deeper , branch by shattered branch , cubble by overstressed cubble . It might continue to sink , falling to the Sixth Level and eventually to the Lower Hell itself . Born would not seek it at that depth for all the meat in the forest , not even for Brightly Go . He had to proceed now , before the chance was forever denied him . He leaned out further over the abyss , tightening his grip on the seemingly unbreakable liana nearby . The liana might have been unbreakable . His grip was n't . Something clutched him around waist and neck and yanked hard . The yell in his throat turned to anger as he disengaged himself from the gentle grasp of Ruumahum . " What the  --  T ' Ruumahum glanced significantly upward , rumbled softly . " Devil comes . " Born peered up through a crack in the well wall . At first he did not see the dark speck against the sky , but it grew rapidly larger . When the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loaded the snuffler . The sky-devil had a long streamlined body suspended between broad wings . Four leathery sacks , two to a side , inhaled air and expelledit out rubbery nozzles near the monster 's tail . It moved in gaspy jerks as it circled lower and lower . A long-snouted reptilian head weaved atop a snakelike neck . Two yellow eyes stared downward , and needlelike teeth flashed in the pale green sunlight . Ideally equipped for skimming silently across the treetops hundreds of meters above and picking off careless arboreals , the sky-devil found itself drawn to something deep in the well . Three-meter wings left it little room for maneuvering within that crude cylindrical gap , but it managed , circling , spiraling lower and lower in tight circles , examining each section of the green wall as it dropped . Born sat very still on his branch , concealed behind a broad leaf taller than Losting , wrapped tight in his green cloak . The devilp31reached his level , circled , and passed on . Staying close to the branch , Born edged his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scaled back and wings winding down toward the blue object . Eventuallyit reached bottom , folded its wings , and stopped . The devil walked clumsily on the blue surface , making its way awkwardly to the halfdomeat the object 's apex . It poked at the globe with its toothed beak , stabbed again . Born could hear it yelling , a distant , muffled croak . Another sound drifted up to him . One that penetrated above the normal din of comb vines and resonators and chattering Chollakees . It was a human scream , and it came from somewhere near or in the ob-ject ! Born started downward without thinking , plunging recklessly from branch to branch , shoulder muscles straining at the shock , taking verticalmeters at a jump . Ruumahum followed close behind . They were making enough noise to attract half the afternoon forest predators , and the furcot told him as much . Wrapped in other thoughts , Born ignoredthe furcot 's warnings . Once he nearly dropped square onto the back of a Chan-pock , the big tree-climbing reptile 's knobby back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the boles of two air-trees . Born 's foot hit the armored back . Instantly he was aware he had met flesh and not wood . But he was moving so fast he was meters below as the Chan-nock whipped furiously around to crush the interloper . Furious at missing its prey , the blunt snout swung round for a stab at Ruumahum . Not even pausing in his downward rush , the furcot stuck out a paw in passing and crushed the flat , arrowhead-shaped skull . If Born stopped to think about what he was doing , he might have fallen and hurt himself seriously . But he was traveling on instinct alone . Unhindered , his reflexes did not fail him . Only when Ruumahumput on an extra burst of speed , got in front of him , and slowed down , did Born become conscious of how fast he had been moving . He nearly dislocated a shoulder as he slowed to a halt behind the furcot . Both were panting heavily.  | " Why stop now , Ruumahum . We --  " The furcot growled softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air-devil is near . Listen . " Born listened . He had been so excited he had nearly shot past the level at which the blue thing lay . Now he could hear the horrible halflaugh , half-coughing of the devil and a scratching sound , a sound similar to the one Reader produced by running his nails over the axe blade during the invocations . Then he was right about the composition of the blue thing ! He had no time to bask in his own glory . A moan sounded now , not a scream ; but it was no less human . " There are people there and the sky-devil is after them , " Born whispered . " But what people live on the Fifth Level ? All persons known live on the Third or Second . " " I do not know , " Ruumahum answered . " I sense much strangeness here . Strangeness and newness . " " It needs killing . " " Air-devils die slowly , Born person , " advised Ruumahum . " Go carefully . " Born nodded and they backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to penetrate here . It is too big and clumsy on the wood . But if it does ... " He started searching , working around the well circumference , always staying well back from the open pit where the nightmare-in-life scratched and clawed at the blue thing . He found what might serve  --  a certain epiphytic orchid that nestled in the crotch formed by the great lower limbs of an emergent . The bottom of the plant overreached the limbs on both sides , the great ball of self-made soil sending long airrootsdownward in all directions . Above , long thick petals of dark chalcedony color curled toward the sky . A wonderful limelike fragrance issued from the huge flower 's depths , its creamy petals many meters long . Keeping a careful distance from the gigantic bloom , Born moved cautiously back toward the well . " Softly , " Ruumahum urged anxiously . Born looked back at the furcotand made quieting motions , but he took the advice . There was more open space here where the light did not penetrate as well . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lianas to lose a big meat-eater in . Surely there was nowhere near enough open space for the sky-devil to spread its wings . But it had thick clawed legs and just maybe could scramble through the open places.  |p33Hence  his enlisting of the orchid as a silent ally . Born reached the edge of the well bottom . A cluster of shattered wood and herbaceous growth bordered it . Everything here was sticky and slippery from spilled sap . He would have to watch his footing . Then suddenly he was staring at the sky-devil from between the leaves . It battered and dug in frustration at something deep within the blue metal disk . The moaning , Born now was sure , came from somewhereinside . Taking a deep breath and wishing for a more stable footing , he lined up the end of the snuffler with the skull of the demon , a difficult target that was bobbing and weaving on a long flexible neck . Born jerked the trigger . There was a tiny explosive puff as the tank seed popped . The jacari thorn hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its slow nervous system reacting dully to the poison , then it spun to look in the direction of the shot . At the same time Born yelled , " Be strong ! " at the top of his lungs , to alert those within the blue metal , then he turned and raced back along the branch . A tremendous thrashing sounded immediately behind him as the sky-devil , showing unexpected strength , smashed through the outer wall of branches and vines in its drooling desire to get at him . Born fancied he could feel its fetid breath hot on his neck . The giant orchid loomed ahead . That crawling leathery horror was at his spine . At any second long teeth might close on his neck and snip his head off . There was no time to look back , no time to think or consider . He dove past the soil ball of the flower , reaching out with the end of the snuffler so that the green wood pipe brushed several of the dozens of dangling rootlets . Born fell another couple of meters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . Above him , the tiny rootlets he had brushed and everything around them curled protectively inward against the bulk of the plant . The sky-devil burst through the undergrowth , reaching with claws and jaws for Born , who stared up in helpless fascination at that descending abomination . Too quick to see , the thick white petals of the pseudo-orchid thrashed in blind fury in all directions . Three of the petals struck the rampaging devil , curled shut about it and contracted . The devil seemed to explode , eyes shooting like ripe seeds from the skull , wings crumpling , guts and innards shooting in all directions . The plant continuedthrashing about for several minutes before the petals began to relax . As it returned to its normal shape and form , the orchid released thep34mangled pulp that had been the sky-devil . The shattered corpse fell bouncing into the depths . Born sat up and watched it fall , his heart beating fast . The devil had died too quickly to scream , never knowing what had hit it . Using his snuffler as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Ruumahum lay , watching him quietly . " I think , " he said , trembling slightly , " we can go help the people now . " The furcot nodded silently . They started back toward the world-well , once again giving the now quiescent pseudo-orchid  --  known in Born 's village as " Dunawetts plant "  --  plenty of room . Born parted the broken stems and walked out into something he had experienced only a few times in his life . Something few people ever experienced  --  the open air . He stared upward , but from here the sky was a distant circlet of blue far , far above , pasted against an otherwisegreen heaven . Nearly half a kilometer above . " Will watch Upper Hell , " Ruumahum announced , sitting himself down by the edge of the well . His head inclined and he studied the distantblue disk . Born extended a cautious foot , set it down easily on the deep blue surface of the object . It was cool and hard , just like the axe blade . Reassured , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the half-dome in the center . As he neared it , he saw it covered a circular cavity in the metal . Looking down at the broken , jagged edges of the dome he saw tangles of tiny vines and roots inside , which were also made of some shiny , hard substance . An inspection of the interior of the disk showed one side made of more metal that was filled with dents and abrasions from the claws and probing beak of the sky demon . Born thought he heard a slight moaning coming from behind it . " Hello . Is anyone alive here ? It is safe to come out . The devil has gone to its cousins in Hell . " The moaning ceased abruptly and was followed by clicking , metallic sounds . Then the section of rectangular metal began to disappear inward , on hinges . A man peered out and up at him with uncertainty . Something small and reflective shone in his hand . Born caught his breath . It was an axe  --  No , no . . . a knife made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaner and smoother . After a long stare the man 's gaze went around the open cavity in the metal . When he satisfied himself that Born'sp35words were true and the sky-devil was safely gone , he emerged into the open space and commenced a detailed survey of the mass of tangled instrumentation and components while keeping a watchful eye on Born . Born studied the giant . Though he was only a normal-sized man by normal man standards , he towered a good twenty-five centimeters over Born . He displayed other surprising characteristics , as well . He was undeniably a person , but the differences were striking . His hair was orange-red instead of brown , his eyes blue instead of green , and his skin  --  his skin was so pale as not to be believed , though among his own people he was considered moderately well tanned . His build was slim and his face freckled and friendly . " Jan ? " A second voice , slightly higher . " Is it clear to  --  T ' Then the speaker caught sight of Born , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of centimeters taller than the man . Her body beneath the torn single-piece jungle suit was bony and athletic . Short hair the color of tarnished silver indicated she was somewhat older , as well . Strong , long legs showed from the beige shorts and their color was also , to Born , unbelievably pale . She seemed less nervous than the man , a little more assured . " Who the hell is that ? " she asked with a jerk of her head . The man she had called Jan continued picking disgustedly at the crushed remnantsof the skimmer 's controls . " The man who just saved our lives , I think . For the moment . " He stared up at the sky uneasily . " The sky-devil is dead , " Born informed him . " It went too near a stimulated Dunawett 's plant . It will not trouble you again . " The man digested this information , grunted something noncommittal , and turned back to his discouraged probing . " Board 's shot to hell and gone , Kimi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart in the touchdown , that flying carnivore pecked to shreds . This skimmer is n't going anywhere except the scrap yard . " The woman sat down in the ruins of a swivel chair , bent now at an angle its designers had never intended . Born stared curiously at her . She suddenly became conscious of his attention and looked up at him . " What are you staring at , short stuff ? " Born bristled , more at her tone than the words . " If my presence makes you uncomfortable . . . " He hefted the snuffler , turned to go . " No , no , wait a minute , fellow . " She rested her head in crossed arms for a minute . " Give me a second , will you ? We 've just beenp36through a pretty rough time . " She looked up again , locked fingers . " You 've got to understand , when our drive went .. . " She noticed Born 's questioning frown and tried again . " When the thing that poweredour skimmer . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall next to her . " When this thing which carries us through the air . . . " Born 's face showed an expression of disbelief , but she pressed on . " . crashed here , we thought we were already dead . Instead we crawled out of what was left of our chairs and found wewere still alive . Shaken , but alive . " She gestured at the surrounding green walls . " This incredible planet  --  three-quarters of a kilometer of stratified rain forest  --  cushioned our fall just enough . " Her voice dropped . " Then that long-necked horror landed on top of us . We barely got through the engine-access hatch when it started working on the door . I thought we were dead all over again . Now you show up and insist some local vegetable has slaughteredsomething it would take an arm's-length laser to discourage . And then there 's the matter of yourself , which is no small shock to us , either . " " What about myself ? " queried Born , unaccountably self-conscious . She made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Borndeclined to do so . " You 're an anomaly , you do n't belong here , according to what we 've been told , " she added hastily . " This is supposed tobe an unreported , barely surveyed , uninhabited world known onlyto  --  " " Careful , Kimi , " the man said warningly , glancing back over his shoulder . She waved him off . " What for , Jan . This "  --  and she nodded towardBorn  --  " native obviously knows nothing that could complicate our presence here . " She looked back at Born as she got to her feet . " As I said , this is supposed to be an uninhabited world . All of a sudden , on the heels of a series of rather disconcerting events , we 're faced with acceptingyour presence . I presume you 're not a solitary freak ? There are others of your kind ? " " The village supports many , " Born told her , in what he hoped was an adequate answer . These giants were fascinating . " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She studiedBorn openly . He bore her examination because he was engaged in one of his own . " You 're nearly a whole foot shorter than an average adult , but you 've got the arms and shoulders of a weight-lifter . " Her gaze lowered considerably . " And what look like awfully long , proba/bly prehensile toes . You 're dark as old redwood and with hair to match . . . but green eyes . Altogether , the most remarkable specimen I 've seen in a long time . Though not , " she added in an odd tone , " for all that , unappealing . " The man made a sound which Born interpreted as one of distaste , though for what reason he could not imagine . Strange and fascinating these giants ! Yet it was they who were calling him strange . " If your people developed here , " the woman was concluding , " despite your coloring and size and grabby toes , it has still got to be the most unlikely , remarkable case of parallel evolution on record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jan ? " The man looked up briefly at Born , then sighed and made a gesture of helplessness toward the board he had been working on . " I do n't know why I 'm fooling with this . It 's hopeless . Even if we could fix the drive without the aid of a full machine shop , that flying beast chewed up the controls like so many worms in a paper bag . We 're stuck here . The tridee 's in no better shape . And all that talk about dying 's probablystill appropriate . " " You give up too soon , too easily , Jan , " she admonished him . She looked at Born . " Our small friend here appears to have unpredictable resources . I do n't see why he could n't  --  " The man whirled , confronting her with outrage barely held in check . " Are you crazy ? It 's hundreds of kilometers to the station through this impenetrable morass . . . " " His people seem able to negotiate it , " she said quietly. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , guided by some ignorant primitives  --  ! " he continued . The language of the giants was peculiar , high and distorted , but Born could make out the meaning of many of their words . One word he recognized clearly , despite the twisted accent , was " ignorant . " " If you are so much the smarter , " he interrupted sharply , " how come you to be here like this ? " And he kicked the blue skin of the skimmer . The giant called Kimi smiled . " He 's got you there , Jan . " The man uttered another disgusted sound and made a related gesture . But he did n't call Born ignorant again . " Now then , " the woman said formally , " I think introductions are in order . First off , we 'd like to thank you for saving our lives , which you most surely did . " She glanced at the man . " Would n't we , Jan ? " He made a muffled sound vaguely intelligible as " yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is Logan . . . Kimi Logan . This sometimesbuoyant , occasionally depressed associate of mine is Jan Cohoma . And you ? " " I am called Born . " " Born . That 's a fine name . A fitting name for one so brave , for a man who 'd tackle a meat-eater like that winged monster single-handed . " Born expanded with pride . Strange the giants might be , but this one at least could be properly admiring . Maybe one day Brightly Go would regard him as well as this peculiar giant did . " You mentioned a village , Born , " she continued . He turned , pointed up and southwest . " The Home lies that way , a fair walk through the forest and two levels higher . My brothers will greet you as friends . " And admire the hunter who had braved the sleeping blue demon and killed a sky-devil to rescue them , he thought to himself . He jumped up and down several times on the blue metal , then noticed that both giants had drawn away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he explained . " I mean you no harm . Of all who came here only I had the courage to descend and find you out . I guessed this . . . thing . . . was not alive , but something carved . " " It 's called a skimmer , " Cohoma told him . " It carries us across the sky . " " Across the sky , " Born repeated , not really believing the words . It seemed impossible that anything so heavy could fly . " We 're glad you did , Born . Are n't we , Jan ? Are n't we ? " She nudged him and he muttered assent . His initial antagonism toward Born was weakening rapidly as he realized that the small native posed no threat to them . Quite the contrary , it seemed . " Yes , it certainly was a brave act . An extraordinary act , now that I think of it . " He smiled . " You 've come this far , Born . Maybe you could help us at least try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world . " " We got a last fix before we went down , " Logan told him . She hesitated , then pointed in a direction roughly toward the Home-tree . " It 's in that direction , about . . . let 's see , how can I get some idea of the distance across to you ? " She thought a moment . " You said something about levels in the forest ? " " Everyone knows the world is made of seven levels , " Born explained , as though lecturing a child , " from the Lower Hell to the treetops. "  | " Figure the average height of one of the big emergents , " she murmured . " Say a little over seven hundred meters . " She engaged in some mental computation , translating meters into levels , and told Born how far away the station lay . Now it was Born 's turn to smile ; he was too courteous to laugh . " No one has ever traveled more than five days ' journey from the Home , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that proved dangerous enough . Now you are talking of a journey of many seven-days . It can not be done , I think . " " Why not ? " Cohoma objected . " You 're not afraid , are you ? Not , " he added quickly as Born took a step toward the bigger man , " an exceptionalhunter like yourself ? " Born relaxed slightly . He had already decided that of the two giants , he liked the man far the less . " It is not a question of fear , " he told them , " but of reason . The balance of the world is delicate . Each creature has its place in that balance , takes what is needed and returns what it can . The further one moves from one 's own niche , the more he disrupts the order of things . When the balance is upset severely , people die . " " I think what he 's saying , Jan , " Logan said to her companion , " is that they believe the further they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully returning to it are reduced . An understandablefeeling , but the explanation is interesting . I wonder how they came to that world-view way of thinking . It 's not natural . " " Natural or not , " Cohoma objected , " I still do n't see why  --  " " Later , " she cut him off . He turned away , muttering to himself . " I think the first thing we should do , " she suggested , " is get out from under this open space before a relative of the monster you so smoothly dispatched , Born , gets curious and comes round to investigate . " That was the first sensible thing the giants had said . He beckoned for them to follow . Cohoma filled his pockets with small packages from various compartments , then let Born lead the way into the trees . Despite the comparative openness of this level and the absence of accustomed vines and branches , Born was startled to see how clumsy the giants were and how hesitantly they advanced . He inquired about their obvious difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On the world we come from , " Logan explained , " we 're used to walking on the ground . "  |p40Born  was shocked . " Can it be that you live in Hell it-self ? " " Hell ? I do n't understand , Born . " He pointed downward . " Two levels below us lie the Lower and True Hell , the surface Hell of mud and shifting earth . It is the abode of monsters too horrible to have names , so it is said . " " I understand . No , Born , our home 's not like that . It 's solid and open and light  --  not full of monsters . At least , " she said with a grin , " not any monsters we ca n't live with . " Like the Church Bureau of Supra-Commonwealth Registry , she reflected . Born 's head was swimming . Everything the giants said seemed to go against all reason and truth , yet their very presence and the solid evidence of their sky craft hinted that yet greater wonders might exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity in favor of more immediateconcerns . " You both look tired and hungry , and you must be exhausted by your ordeal . " Cohoma added a heartfelt " Amen ! " " I will take you to the Home . We can talk further there , and more easily . " " One question , Born , " asked Logan . " Are the rest of your people as receptive to strangers as you are ? " " Think you we are not civilized ? " Born asked . " Any child knows that a guest is as a brother and must be so treated . " " A man after my own heart , " sighed Cohoma . " I 've got to apologize , friend Born . I had some wrong ideas about you , at first . Lead on , short stuff . " Born pointed upward . " To the Home level first  --  a fair climb . " Both giants groaned . Judging from what he had seen of their climbing abilitythus far , Born could understand their reaction . " I will try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time  --  " " We 'll risk it , " said Logan . Born located a spiraling branch root , descending in a tight double helix from an air-tree somewhere far above . They would have several dozen meters of simple ascent . He started upward , and as he did a scream sounded behind him . He reached for the snuffler , relaxed when he saw it was only Ruumahum . The fear displayed by the two giants at the sight of the affectionate furcot was amusing . " It 's only Ruumahum , " he informed them . " My furcot . He 'd no more harm you than me . " " Persons , " grunted Ruumahum sardonically , sniffing first at thep41waist of a frozen Logan , then Cohoma . Neither giant moved , relaxing only when that great fanged head moved away . " My God , " Logan muttered , staring in awe at the massive form as it bounded into the canopy overhead , " it talks . That 's two sapient forms Survey missed . " She looked at Born with new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " she asked wonderingly . Born considered in confusion , then understanding dawned . " You mean , " he said in amazement , " you have no furcots of your own ? " He looked from a stupefied Logan to Cohoma . " Furcots of our own ? " echoed Logan . " Why should we ? " " Why , " Born recited without thinking , " every person has his furcot and every furcot its person , as every flitter its blossom , every cubble its anchor tree , every pfeffermall its resonator . It 's the balance of the world . " " Yes , but that still does n't explain how you tamed them , " pressed Cohoma , staring after the departed carnivore . " Tame . " Born 's expression twisted . " It 's not a question of taming . Furcots like persons and we like the furcots . " He shrugged . " It is natural . It has always been so . " " It talked , " noted Logan aloud . " I distinctly heard it say ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright , " Born admitted , " but they talk well enough to make themselves understood . " He smiled . " There are persons who talk less . " For some reason this caused both giants to launch into a long discussion between themselves , full of complex terms Born did not understand . This made him uncomfortable . Anyway , it was time they started Home , time he received the adulation and accolades due him . " We must go now , but there is a condition . " That veiled threat was enough to cause the giants to break off their argument and stare at him . " What condition ? " Logan asked apprehensively . Born stared at Cohoma . " That he no longer calls me short stuff . Otherwise I will call him clumsy-cub every time his foot slips on a pathway . " Cohoma managed a tight smile , but Logan guffawed openly . " He 's got you there , Jan . " The latter just grunted , muttered something about getting on their way , and started up the road after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added gruffly . As they moved upward , Born considered Cohoma 's last remark.  |p42The  concept of " wasting time " was personally intriguing , since in the Home it usually had been applied only to him . Was it possible there were others who felt as he did about the way time was spent ? If so , there was another reason for getting to know these giants better . He already knew of several others . The forest had been burned back to leave a clear zone around the armored , domed station which sat in the largest open space  --  for that matter , the only open space  --  in the hylaea , a silver-gray bubble rising from an ocean of green , like the exhalation of a colossal diver swimmingfar below . The circular , domed structure rested on the sheared-off trunks of three Pillar trees , whose neatly trimmed branches formed a system of braces and struts as strong as any artificial supports the builders could have provided . Eventually the cut-off giant trees would die and topple over , but by then the station would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master plan by much larger , more permanent structures built elsewhere . The cleared zone around the station was designed to prevent any further deaths from the local saw-tooth , hook-clawed predators , who had killed three of the station 's builders before its major defenses were installed and powered up . Discovering that no creature of the forest cared to cross an area open to the sky  --  and to the sky-borne killers  --  the construction engineers had burnt back the green ramparts many meters from the station , as well as several meters down below its bottomlevel . Two occupants of the station had been carried off by aerial predatorswhile walking along the peripheral strollway . Then the station 's defenses were strengthened , until it resembled a small fortress . The lasers and explosive guns were hardly fitting to a structure dedicated primarily to research and exploration . The less lethal instrumentation was located within the gray building . It was that nexus of inner laboratoriesthat the wall of weapons was erected to protect . Scouting parties went out in armed skimmers to search the end/less forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another  --  the forest proved to be an inexhaustible source of surprises  --  which were metamorphosed into commercial possibilities within the labs . These findings were relayed to other men who in turn relayed the information to a deep space beam operator , who by various devious means  --  since the presence of the station was illegal , as it had neither been registered nor inspected nor officially approved  --  passed it on to a distant world . There one man with a machine transcribed the myriad discoveries into figures , relayed them to a second , who took them to a third , who laundered them for a fourth , who laid them carefully on the desk of a person withered in body but not in mind . That person studiedthe figures . Every so often she would smile crookedly and nod , and then orders would go back along the carefully concealed chain of commanduntil eventually they were disseminated within the dome on The World With No Name . So closely guarded was the location of The World With No Name that few of those who worked within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot was sent to it twice . Pilot relayed information to successor , for the coordinates could not even be trusted to mechanical safekeeping . This was chancy since the coordinates could be lost forever , but the advantage of absolute secrecy made it worthwhile . Since no one knew its location , no one could divulge it voluntarily or otherwiseto agents of Commonwealth or Church . Anyone questioned on the subject could admit freely to what he knew  --  which was nothing . The whole operation was very professional . In the largest of those inner laboratories , the most intelligent of the station 's researchers studied the huge , ovoid chunk of dark wood that dominated the far end of the chamber . It had been cut open . This piece of wood had made all the expense and secrecy and effort worthwhile , and Wu Tsing-ahn had been working with it even before the construction of the station had been completed . He was a small man , with delicate , tortured features and black hair turned prematurely white at odd places . The private agony which strained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or dulled his analytical abilities . Like everyone else in the station , he was aware that his activities on this planet were not in keeping with the Ordainments of the Church or Commonwealth law . Most were there for the money . Tsing-ahn showed a certain fluttering of the hands , a twitch of both eyelids . Both were by-products of the drug which gave great pleasurep44at great expense . Tsing-ahn required it now , required it regularly in large doses . He had been forced to suspend his moral principles to satisfythe craving . But he did n't care any more . Besides , the work was not especially difficult and was intellectually pleasing . There was emotionalrefuge in that . There was a knock on the door across the room . Tsing-ahn acknowledgedthe knock , and a large man entered , his slight limp noticeableand unavoidable , contact lenses reflecting the steady overhead light . The man was no giant , but each of his biceps was bigger around than the biochemist 's thigh . He wore a holstered sidearm , prominently displayed . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big man responded . He crossed the room , nodded toward the pierced and cut section of wood . " Found out what makes it tick yet ? " " I 've been reluctant to risk chancing its drug-producing properties until just now , Nearchose , " Wu replied softly . " Full dissection could destroy that . " He reached out and touched the wood . Nearchose studied it . " How much you think a burl that size is gon na be worth , Doc ? " Tsing-ahn shrugged . " How much is a doubled life-span worth to a man , Nearchose ? " He gazed at the burl with something more than scientific detachment . " I 'd guess a burl this size would yield enough extract to double the life-span of anywhere from two to three hundred people  --  not to mention what it will do for general health and well-being . No price has been put on the drug yet since it has n't been exportedexcept in small , experimental doses . The proteins have proven complex beyond belief . Synthetic induction appears out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of research . " He looked up . " What would you pay for it , Nearchose ? " " Who , me ? " The security guard smiled a crooked smile , showing metal teeth , which had replaced ones that had not been lost naturally . " I 'll die when my natural time comes , Doc . A man like me . . . I could n't ever afford the stuff . I 'd give or do anything for it , of course , if I thought I could get away with it . " Tsing-ahn nodded . " Far wealthier men will do likewise . " He winked . " Maybe I 'll slip you a vial of the next batch . How would that appeal to you , Nearchose ? " The guard 's genial manner faded . He looked solemnly down at his friend , whom he could break with one hand . " Do n't tease me like that ,  |p45Doc  . It 's not funny . To live a couple of hundred years in good health , instead of decomposing into pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tease me with stuff like that . " " Sorry , Nick . It 's a defense mechanism with me . I 've got my own hurts , you know . It 's small and mean , but I fight back in these ways . " Nearchose nodded . He knew of the biochemist 's addiction , of course . Everyone at the station did . The brilliant researcher Tsingahnwas deficient in body , though he was not crippled or broken . Nearchose was deficient in mind , though he was neither stupid nor ignorant . Each recognized his superiority over others of his own kind at the station , so the friendship that sprung up between them was one betweenequals . " I 've got outside patrol this shift , " Nearchose announced , turning to leave . " I was just curious to see how everything 's going , that 's all . " " Surely , Nick . Come in anytime . " After the big man had left for his patrol duty , Tsing-ahn set up his instruments for the first full dissection of the invaluable burl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the fact that this was the only burl of its kind found so far . Others would be located by the scout teams , he was certain . It was merely a question of time . When extract from the burl 's center was given casually to an experimentalCarew , the results were unexpected , astonishing , overwhelming . Instead of two days , the hyperactive mammal had lived for nearly a week . He had repeated the experiment twice , not believing his own results . When they were confirmed the third time , he had announced his discovery to Hansen , the station director . The reaction of those funding the project had been predictable : More burls must be found . But exploring by skimmer was erratic and difficult . Land partieshad been sent out , but they had been discontinued by Hansen despite complaints from above . Too many parties , no matter how heavily armed , had failed to return . Tsing-ahn was still fascinated by the fact that this unhealthy protrusionof the tree might prove more useful than the tree itself . He thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study the internal structure of the burl . It had a softish center , according to long probes , quite unlike most burls , which were solid hardwood . And there was other evidence of a unique inner construction . He worked at the dissection for several days , sawing and probing and cutting open . At the end of that time , a most unnatural and horri/ble scream shattered the peace of the station and sent people running from their posts to the laboratory of Wu Tsing-ahn . Nearchose was the first one there . This time he did n't ask permission to enter , but wrenched the door open , breaking the bolt . To his enormous surprise , Tsing-ahn stood facing him and looked up at him calmly . One hand was trembling slightly and an eyelid flickered , but that was only normal . A crowd had gathered behind Nearchose . He turned , shooed them away . " Nothing to see . Everything 's okay . The Doc had a bigger baddreamthan he 's used to , that 's all . " " You sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria . I 'll handle it . " The crowd dribbled away muttering among themselves as Nearchose closed the broken door . " What 's the trouble , Nick ? Why the indelicate entrance ? " The guard turned to him , studied the man whom he often did not understand , but whom he unfailingly respected . " That was you that screamed , Doc . " It was n't a question . Tsing-ahn nodded . " That was me , yes , Nick . " He looked away . " I 'm flying on my morning dose and . . . I thought I saw something . I do n't have your mental resilience , Nick , and I 'm afraid I let it get a hold of me for a second . Sorry if it disturbed everyone . " " Sure , yeah , " Nearchose finally replied . " Worried about you , that 's all . Everyone does , you know . " " Sure , yeah , " Tsing-ahn echoed bitterly . Nearchose fidgeted uneasily in the silence , looked past the scientist toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work coming ? " Tsing-ahn answered absently , his mind obviously elsewhere . " Well . Better than one might expect . Yes , quite well . I should have some definite announcements to make in a couple of days . " " That 's great , Doc . " Nearchose turned to go , paused . " Listen , Wu , if you need anything , anything you 'd rather not go through channels for . . . " Tsing-ahn smiled faintly . " Of course , Nick . You 'll be the first one I turn to . " The security guard grinned reassuringly and closed the door quietly behind him . Tsing-ahn returned to his work . He proceeded calmly once more and with his accustomed efficiency . Nothing else disturbed the tranquility of the station until that evening , when a passerby thought he smelled something unusual in the corridor outside the lab . Following the odor led to visual confirmation  --  dark wisps of smoke issuing from the cracks around Wu 's laboratory door . The man yelled " Fire ! " and hit the nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ahead of Nearchose . He had to work his way through the personnel who were putting out the last pockets of flame . Containment had been achieved before the blaze could spread beyond the confines of the lab , but the lab itself was a complete wreck . The fire had been brief , but intense . Not only was there plenty of flammable material within the lab , but Tsing-ahn had apparently utilized white phosphorous on stubborn materials and acids on anything that refused to ignite . The little biochemist had been as methodical in destruction as he had been in research . Everyone clustered around the few charred scraps of wood that were scattered around the back of the lab . They were all that remained of the burl which had been worth untold millions . Nearchose 's main concern lay elsewhere , so it was he who first found the body sprawled under a table across the room . At first he assumed the scientist had died of smoke inhalation , since there were no marks on his body . Then he rolled him over and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutched convulsively in one hand , saw the tiny holes of equal diameter on both the front and back of the skull . He knew what a needler did , knew he could slip a pencil neatly through that hole . The man 's eyes were closed and his expression , for the first time that Nearchose could remember , was contented . Nearchose stood up . The pitiable , weak genius below him had run across something that impelled him to his own death . Nearchose had no idea what that thing might be and was not sure he would care to know . No man is perfect . An old sergeant had first repeated that cliche to him . For all his brilliance , Tsing-ahn had been less perfect than most . A scrap of note here , a page of book there were all that had survived . Employed at the station were a lesser biochemist named Celebes and a botanist named Chittagong . Together they did not quite make up one Tsing-ahn , but they were the best Hansen had . They were taken off their projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper and scraps of notebook , and ordered to undertake the reconstruction of Tsing-ahn 's work . Eventually , a second burl of the type carbonized in the fire was located and brought back . It was presented to Chittagong and Celebes , who worked with it , while newly installed security monitors watched constantly , checking everythingp48from the scientists ' heartbeats to the growls in their stomachs . Both men were less than enthusiastic about the project , especially concerning the manner of their comrade 's death . However , the orders came down from an enraged person at a large desk many parsecs away . They were not to be disputed . Nearchose returned to his duties . He sat at his gimbal post and brooded on what there was in a simple hunk of wood that impelled someone as rational as Tsing-ahn to go off the deep end . Such things happened , and he need not concern himself with them . But he could not help it . He sighed , and forced himself to turn his gaze and attention to the surrounding wall of forest . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ouch ! " Born stopped , looked back at his charges . Logan was hopping awkwardlyon one foot on the cubble , holding a trailing liana for support . Born let go of the vine-root he was holding and dropped next to her . She sat down , holding her left leg . She seemed more angry than hurt . Cohoma was studying something Logan was concealing with a hand . " What is it ? " She smiled up at him . Beads of sweat were beginning to form on her forehead . " I stepped on something . " She looked around , gestured . " That flower there ... went right through my boot . " Born saw the tiny collection of bright orange thorns sticking up from the middle of the miniature bouquet of six-petaled lavender blooms . His expression changed . A hand reached under his cloak and he brought out the bone blade . " Hey ! " Cohoma started to move between them . Born shoved the bigger man aside . Cohoma stumbled and nearly fell off the cubble . " Lie down ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chest and shoving . She went down , hard , then started to sit up slightly , bracing herself with her hands . " Born what are you doing ? It stings a little , but  --  '  |p49He  yanked the boot off and she fell backward again , hitting her head on the wood . Then he raised her leg and held the knife over it . " Now wait a minute , Born ! " Her voice turned panicky . Cohoma had recovered his footing , took a threatening step toward the hunter . " Just a second , you misplaced pygmy . Explain  --  " There was a warning growl just overhead and he looked up . Ruumahum was leaning over the cobble just above him , holding on with four legs , the front paws dangling and claws extended . The furcot smiled , showing more ivory than a concert grand . Cohoma looked into his three eyes and clenched his fists , but kept them at his side . " This will hurt a little , " Born said quickly . He cut into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Logan screamed violently , fell back and tried to twist free . Holding her foot tightly , Born put his mouth over the freely bleeding wound , sucked and spat , sucked and spat . When he finished , she was crying softly and trembling . After a cautious glance at Ruumahum , Cohoma moved to comfort her . Born ignored the giant 's tense questions while searching the surroundingfoliage . He found what he needed , a cluster of herbaceous cylinders growing from a nearby limb . Finding an old one , he cut it off at the base . It was half the length of his arm . The knife took the top off , revealing a hollow tube filled with clear liquid . He drained it , sighed , and tried another one . This he offered to the injured woman . Logan finished rubbing at her eyes , stared at him . " Drink it , " he advised simply . She started to take it and recoiled at the feel of the mushy stem . Then she put her lips hesitantly to the rim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She passed the remainder to him . Cohoma studied it warily . " How do we know he 's not trying to poison us ? " " If he wanted to kill us , " she sighed , " he could have left us for the flying meat-eater , Jan . Do n't be a fool . There 's nothing in that but water . " Cohoma sipped at it reluctantly , but finished what was left . " Your foot . . . how does it feel ? " Born inquired solicitously . Logan drew her knee up , pulled it in to where she could see the bottom . The wound was not as deep as she had feared , certainly not as deep as it had felt when Born was cutting it . It was already beginning to heal . Around the multiple punctures , though , the skin had turned a dull red.  | " Like someone took a knife to it , " she shot back . " How should it feel ? " " You feel nothing besides the cut ? " Born pressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around where I stepped on the thorns . . . like when your foot goes to sleep . But that 's all . " " Tingle , " Born said thoughtfully . He started searching the brush again . Both giants watched him curiously . He paused before one plant , then plucked a pale yellow fruit from a branch far above , where it hung in neat clusters of three . " Eat this , " he instructed Logan when he rejoined them again . She examined it doubtfully . Of all the fruits and edible vegetation Born had introduced to them , this appeared the most formidable . It was shaped like a squat barrel , with brown riblike extrusions running around its circumference . " Skin and all ? " " Skin and all , " Born said , nodding , " and quickly . It will be better for you . " She brought it to her mouth . So much of the foliage on this world was deceptive  --  maybe this tough-looking specimen would have a. . . then she bit into it . Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told Cohoma , " like spoiled cheese seasoned with vinegar . What happens , " she asked Born appealingly , " if I do n't finish this thing ? " " I believe  --  I think , I got all of the poison out of your system . If not , you have a few moments left before the remaining poison spreads to your nervous system and kills you . Unless it is countered by the antitoxinin fruit . " Logan finished the yellow pulp with speed that belied her nausea . Still , she found time to wonder at how words like " antitoxin " and terms like " nervous system " had lasted in these people 's vocabulary down through the years of their fall from knowledge . Undoubtedly , she reflected , these expressions were constantly used in this **26;2267;TOOLONG . As she reached this conclusion , her eyes widened , her cheeks bulged , and she turned and retched with such violencethat Born and Cohoma had to move fast to keep her heaving body from falling off the cubble . Minutes later she was lying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across her mouth . " Holy orders ! " she wheezed . " I feel like I 've been turned inside out . " She put both hands to her abdomen and felt around gently . " Still there  --  you could have bet me it was n't . " Born ignored her gasps and complaints . " How does your foot feel now ? "  | " Still tingles a little . " " Just your foot ? " he persisted , staring intently at her . " Not your ankle , or your lower leg , here ? " He touched her calf . She shook her head . Born grunted , got to his feet . " Good . If your leg tingled , the poison would have spread past my ability to halt it . Then it would have been too late . But you will be all right , now . " She nodded and started to get to her feet with Cohoma 's help . Then she stared sharply at Born . " Hey  --  if it was so vital that I eat that fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking it and bringing it down ? According to what you just said , I could have died in the in-terim . " The hunter stared back at her with the patient look one reserves for very young children . " I had to be sure the tesshanda would not object to my taking its fruit , since it was not yet quite ripe . " Both Logan and Cohoma appeared confused . " Are you saying , " she went on , " that you had to ask that plant 's permission ? That you talked to it ? " " I did not say that , " Born explained easily . " I emfoled it . " " Emfoled ? Oh , you mean you felt the fruit to see if it was ripe  --  enfoldedit . " Born shook his head . " No . . . emfoled . You do not emfol with your plants ? " " I guess not , since I 've no idea what you 're talking about , Born . " He looked satisfied without being pleased . " Ah , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't , " Cohoma replied . " Look , Born , are you sayingyou talked or conversed with that plant and that it gave you an okay to pick a fruit before it was ripe ? " " No , no , I emfoled it . If the fruit was ripe , I would not have had to , of course . " " Why of course ? " Logan asked , feeling the conversation growing steadily more tenuous . " Because then the tesshanda would have emfoled me . " " Some kind of ritual superstition , " she muttered . " The logic trappingsare intriguing . Wonder where it sprang from ? Give me a hand up , Jan . " He did so and she immediately winced , bent over and held her stomach . " Can you walk ? " Born inquired , still patient . " No , but I 'm an accomplished stumbler . " She forced a sickly grin . " Talk about the cure being worse than the disease . . . I do n't thinkp52you 'd make it as a Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you 've saved my life . Thanks . " " Third time , " Born told her without explaining . " We are near to the Home , now . Another half-level up and two or three levels distant . " Both giants groaned . " I 've never seen a tree like that , not on Survey or in any of the other reports , " Cohoma announced when they had their first sight of the Home . " You have n't been keeping up , Jan , " his partner admonished . " The next to the last eastward skimmer brought back the details on it . It 's called a weaver . The central trunk hardly narrows at all till it attains the five- or six-hundred-meter level . Then it splits and resplits into an interlocking maze of trunklets that form a . .. well . . . a kind of enormous central basket in the tree . Then the subtrunks recombine a few dozen meters higher to form a single bole again that reaches all the way to the forest top . According to the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red fruit , mostly sugar pulp around a nutlike center , that 's about as rich in nourishment components as anythingfound locally so far  --  and rich in niacin , of all things . " She pointed as they neared the first trunklets and walked along a thick tuntangcle . " See those pods growing from the pink blossoms ? Accordingto the report , if you brush against one , you get a face full of pollen . If you breathe that stuff , it 's good-bye , according to the lab analysis . Fungal spores settle in the lungs and esophagus , spread instantly and choke you inside two minutes . " She was suddenly aware that Born showed no sign of swerving from the deadly flower-sprouting vines . " We 're going around this tree , are n't we , Born ? There ca n't be a poison here your people do n't know about . " " Go around ? " Born eyed her oddly . " This tree is the Home . " He approached the tangle of flower-laden vines and branchlets . " Born . .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly pods . One touch would send a shower of suffocating pollen into the air . Born stopped at the first vine , leaned over , and spat directly into one of the broad blooms , avoiding the swollen pod . A shiver appeared to pass through the vine as the glistening petals closed on themselves . The shiver continued . Then , fake a twig curling back from flame , the vines tightened , retracted on themselves , revealing a clear path through the brambles.  | " Quickly now , " Born urged , starting between the passage . A streak of emerald lightning shot past the two giants as they began to follow . Ruumahum had not waited for them to make up their minds . When they were through and safe , both turned to watch the tension slip out of the vines . They relaxed , once again barring the way as effectively as a duralloy wall . " Remarkable , " Cohoma murmured . He questioned Born as they strode deeper into the heart of the Home-tree . " What would happen , Born , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nothing , " the hunter told him . " You are not of the Home . The Home recognizes only its own . " " I do n't see how  --  " he began , but Logan was already analyzing the possibilities . " Tell me , Born , " she asked , " do your people eat the fruit of the weaver  --  the Home ? " Born looked back at her , aghast . At times these giants seemed to possess knowledge beyond imagining ; at other times , they could be incredibly stupid . " Is there anything better to eat except perhaps fresh meat ? " He had heard Logan 's recital of the Survey report on the weaver , but had not understood . " Why would we not eat of what is so readily provided for us ? " " Interesting , " Logan agreed . Then she again began using words of no meaning to Born , and he willingly ignored their conversation . " You see the connection yet , Jan ? " Her companion nodded . " I think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis ; it 's probably their staple food . Chemicals from the fruit mass in their system . When they spit into one of the flowers , chemicals from the ingested fruit are included in the saliva . No wonder the Home recognizes its own ! " " I can see what 's in it for the people , " Logan confessed . " Food and shelter . What , if anything , does the tree get out of it ? " Their musings were interrupted by a shout , then another , and another . Soon they were surrounded by a group of goggling children  --  perfectly normal children in every way , if one discounted the predominanceof deep brown skin , hair , and green eyes , plus their shortness . The youngsters eyed the two giants with the kind of awe they would have reserved for a pink furcot . Din was there , too . He fell in step alongside Born . Puffing out his thin chest , he matched the hunter stride for stride , except for an oc/casional skip needed to keep up . Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth never cease pestering him ? Muf tagged along behind his person , his very presence a sign of curiosityunusual for a furcot . Otherwise he would have been off with his brethren somewhere in the trunklets , sleeping . The cub nosed his way through the group of children and sniffed questioningly at Logan . She shied away at first , then reached out and hesitantly patted the cub on the head . A low rumble began to sound from somewhere deep within the six-legged ball of fur . The cub edged closer to Logan , nearly knocking her over . A streamlined , rippling green shape was alongside her in a second . " If cub troubles , slap , " Ruumahum advised Logan in his rumbling bass . She gazed down at the cub , who was staring up at her with worshipfulmultiple eyes . " Slap him  --  certainly not ! " she objected . " He 's only being affectionate . " Ruumahum snorted derisively , padded on ahead . This unlikely parade  --  one person , two furcots , a gaggle of softly chattering children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the side of the central leafleather pavilion . Born 's gaze swept over the surrounding homes . Somewhere an adult furcot yawned loudly . No crowd came running from the half-open doorways . No covey of adolescent girls hurried to feel his arms and torso and to make cooing sounds . No hunters arrived to study his giants with the awe the children had shown . There was no praise , no admiring compliments , no adulation or expressions of proper commendationfor his courage and boldness  --  only the curious stares of a few oldsters peeping out from behind leafleather doorways . Something hit Born at the back of his knees , and he fell forward , landing in a puddle of stagnant night-water . Muf scrambled and hid among the children . They laughed delightedly . Getting slowly to his feet , Born tried to regain his dignity while shaking the water free from the cloak . The laughter continued . He turned and yelled at them . They drew back slightly , but the smiles did not entirely vanish . He took a step toward the nearest child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they scattered , naked brown bodies darting nimbly into the doorways of homes , or behind ridges and humps in the wooden paving of the square . Born found he was breathing hard . It seemed he had a limitless capacity for making a fool of himself . " Not quite the reception you hoped for , hmmm ? " Cohoma ven/tured with surprising sympathy . " I know exactly how you feel . I 've experiencedthe same lack of appreciation myself . " He shot a significant glance at Logan that she missed . All at once the anger flowed out of the hunter , and he relaxed somewhat , feeling at the same time an unexpected sense of kinship to this strange man who claimed to travel the Upper Hell in a boat made of axe metal . " Where is everyone , anyway ? " Logan wondered . Born just shrugged and led them on toward his own vestibule , located high in the trunklets at the far end of the Home cage . " Gatheringfruit , caring for the Home . . . " " Parasite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point for the tree . Better the human parasite you know than the unreasonable animal or plant you do n't . " " Symbiote , not parasite , " Logan countered . " Both tree and man benefit . I wonder , though , what the weaver trees did for protection before Born 's ancestors made them their home . " " . . . or hunting , perhaps , " Born concluded , ignoring their whispers . " All will return before the night comes . " He smiled to himself . He could still count on Brightly Go 's reaction when he introduced the giants to the council tonight . Born 's own living quarters elicited more peculiar words from the giants . " See , " Logan went on , indicating the walls and ceiling , " the smaller branches and vines grow so close together here that it 's a simplematter to close off the remaining space with woven material . " Cohoma murmured agreement , sat down and ran a finger along the smooth wood of the floor . An idea was forming that he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explained the function of a circular crevice in the floor located near the back of the big room . " I just wonder , " he mumbled aloud , " who has adapted to whom , here  --  man to tree , or tree to man ? Maybe nothing lived in the weavers before the colonists discovered them . But I do n't understand how such detailed , specialized interdependence could have developed in a few generations . " Logan considered silently . Born eyed the two of them without understandingas they continued to talk between themselves . What did they mean , man adapt to tree or tree to man ? The Home was the Home . It was only sensible that a man should take care of his dwelling . What was it like , he wondered , on the world where these giantsp56came from , that they found the natural order of things here so astonishing ? He did not think he would care for it . Then a freak thought struck him  --  freak , because it seemed so impossible . " Can it be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that on your world there is nothing that grows ? " " No , " Logan corrected , " there 's much that grows , but nothing we live in , as you do . But we use our growing things , as your people do . " " Use ? I do n't understand , Kimilogan . " She settled herself back against a branch . " Some plants we eat the fruit of , others we make into foods we can eat , some we still , but rarely , use in the building of our homes . Some we use for medicinal purposes , as you did the tesshanda . We use the forest world much as you do . " " I still do not understand , " Born said . " We do not use the forest . We are a part of the forest , the world . We are part of a cycle that cannotbe broken . We no more use the forest than the forest uses us . " Cohoma murmured something unintelligible at that . " Your people serve this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't realize it . You 're its servants , in a sense . " " Servants . " Born thought hard , spread his hands helplessly . " What is a servant ? " " Someone who performs a service at the bidding of another , " she explained . Madder and madder ! Truly the giants had spells of madness , Born mused . " We do not serve the tree , the Home . The Home serves us . " Logan eyed him a little sadly , then she looked over at Cohoma . " They do n't understand , all right . Probably would n't want to . " " And why not ? " Cohoma added . " They seem perfectly happy with the arrangement . " " It ties them down mentally , though , " she countered . " With shelter and basic food provided by nature , there 's neither reason nor motivationto regain the knowledge they 've lost . We 'll have trouble trying to re-educate them . Tell me , Born , " she asked gently , turning to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dried grazer meat , " would you ever consider leaving your tree ? " Born was so shocked he stood momentarily frozen . " Leave the Home ? You mean , forever ? Not to come back ? " She nodded . That confirmed the giants ' madness . Why would anyone even think of leaving the Home ? Here was shelter , food , companionship , security ,  |p57and  protection from the unpredictable jungle outside . Away from the Home lay only uncertainty and eventual death . Then he understood the reason , and it explained many of the giants ' strange words . " I see , " he told them as gently as possible . " I truly did not understand before . It is evident that you have no Home of your own . " " We have homes , " Cohoma shot back . " Mine would overwhelm you , Born . It does what I tell it to , offers food when I wish it , and I come and go from it as I please . " " You do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but  --  " Logan 's chuckle cut him off . " He 's got you there , Jan . " Cohoma looked upset . " Not at all . I can leave anytime I want , for as long as I want , without worrying about it . But these people ca n't . " " That is not a Home , then , " Born argued . " One cares for a Home , and one 's Home cares for its own . " " Well , it 's my home , " Cohoma grumbled , sampling a spiral nut from the cluster spread before him . It offered a faint flavor of pepper and celery . He took a second . " I see , " Born replied . He was too polite to add what he knew . Though there had been no talk of material construction , of artificial abodes , Born knew that the giants ' homes were not living , but were dead things , rotten with indifference . For all their wonders , Born would not live in a dead thing , dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . Thoughts of axes and the waning daylight reminded him that the hunters and gatherers would soon return . He would present the giants to them then and perhaps finally someone would venture to say that the hunter Born was a bit more daring and brave and worthy than the average hunter . As he sat and ate and composed what he would say , he noticed toes below the leafleather doorway . He got to his feet , shoved the partition aside . Din jerked back , startled , but Born was too preoccupied with the anticipation of his own triumph to be angry . Instead , he invited the boy in to eat , putting a foot in the face of the cub Muf when it tried to follow . The cub whimpered , but stayed outside . Born found some food for the youth and the orphan consumed it eagerly . So much for his audience : an orphan child and two giants afflicted with inherent insanities . He bit angrily into a tough slab of meat.  | " A number of colony transports , " Cohoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening Home fire , " were reported lost , sometimes in a natural disaster , sometimes through a careless shift in records by an incompetent clerk . " He swallowed , aware he was treading on quasireligious grounds . " It seems likely , " he continued , stressing the word likely , " that you people are descended from the survivors of one such ship and are trapped here . Though considering the inimical nature of this world , I find it incrediblethat any of the misplaced colonists were able to survive after the initial supplies were exhausted . " He sat down again . " That 's our best guess , anyway . " No one seated around the evening blaze said anything . Cohoma and Logan eyed their shorter , better armed cousins a mite apprehensively . " All this , " Chief Sand finally responded slowly , " may be as you say . " Both giants relaxed visibly . " But while we have not the benefit of your peculiar knowledge , we have explanations of our own for our existence . " He glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  was clad in his ceremonial raiment of spotted gildver fur , brilliant brown and red with orange stripes , and the feathered headdress wrought from moltings drifted down from the Upper Hell . And the axe , of course , which he brandished prominently as he rose . Swinging it like a conductor'sbaton , he told the story of how the world happened . " In the beginning there was the seed , " Reader intoned solemnly . The people listened reverently . They had heard the legend a thousand times , yet it still commanded their attention . " And not a very big seed at that , " the shaman continued . " One day the thought of water descended , and the seed took root in the wood of emfol . " That word again , Logan mused . " It grew . Its trunk became strong and tall . Whereupon it put out many branches . Some of these formed the Pillars which dominate the world . Others changed and became the two hells which envelop the world . Then buds appeared , buds uncounted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the furcots another , the peeper that lies still in the hyphae yet another . The seed prospers , the world prospers , we prosper . " Cohoma held his knees up and together . " If that 's so , and if you believe we come from a planet different from this one , how does all that fit into your universe ? " " The branches of the seed tree spread far , " Reader replied . There were appreciative murmurs from the circle.  | " What if one of your branches was transplanted to another part of this tree ? " " It would die . Each blossom knows its place on its branch . " " Then you can understand our situation , " Cohoma went on . " The same is true with us . If we do n't return to our particular branch  --  or seed , or home , or station  --  we will surely die , too . Wo n't you help us ? We would do as much for you . " Logan and Cohoma did their best to appear indifferent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw another rotted section of log onto the fire . It blazed higher , tossing off angry sparks , slim smoke trails rising lazily to curl skyward around the edges of the leaf ( eather canopy . Warm rain dripped down through the smoke . Sand , Joyla , and Reader conferred in whispers . Finally , Sand raised a hand and the muttering subsided . " We will help you return to your branch station , your Home , " he announced in a strong voice that sounded as if it came from a distant loudspeaker and not that thin frame . " If it is possible . " Born held his place in the inner circle and stared groundward so his smile would not be visible to the chief or to Reader or to any of his fellows . He could hardly wait for their response when they found out how far away this precious station of the visitors actually was . No one laughed when Logan told them . " Such a journey is unthought of , " Sand announced when Logan had concluded . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompany you , can not . " " But did n't I make it clear ? " Logan said pleadingly , scrambling to her feet and gazing anxiously around at the silent brown faces . " If we do n't get back to our station we 'll .. . we 'll wither , wither and die . We 'll  --  " The chief cut her off with a calming hand . " I said I could not direct anyone to accompany you . This is so . I would not order any hunter to undertake such a journey , but if one wished to go with you . . . " " This is foolish talk , " the gatherer Dandone commented from her place . " No one would return alive from such a trek . There are tales of places where the Lower and Upper Hells are joined and the world stops . " " You confuse bravery and foolishness , " Joyla countered . " A foolishperson is merely one who does brave things without thought . Would not any among us risk her life to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hazards ? And would we not seek help from whomever we found ourselves among ? " She looked over at the giants . " If these people are like us , they will go despite our entreaties and warnings . Perhaps we have some among us brave enough to go with them . I am no hunter , so I can not . " " If I were a young man , " Sand added , " I would go , despite the dangers . " But you are young no longer , Born thought to himself . " But since I am young no longer , " the chief continued , " I can not . Let this not restrain others , those among you who may be eager to go . " He stared around at the assembly , as did Cohoma and Logan , as did the men and women , as did the wide-eyed children who stared inwardfrom behind shoulders and heads and between calves . No one stepped forward . The only sounds were the brisk crackle of dead wood in the fire , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to think it out , Born found himself saying , " I will go with the giants . " Innumerable stares of varying intent and intensity pinned him in his place . Now , at last , he hoped for some show of admiration and appreciation . Instead , those stares held sadness and pity . Even the two giants gazed on him with expressions of satisfaction and relief , but not of adulation . Bitterly he reflected how that might change in the many seven-days ahead . " The hunter Born will accompany the giants , " Sand noted . " Will any others ? " Born looked around at his friends . There was stirring within the inner circle , but it came from men finding excuses to study the ground before them , to feel the warmth of the fire , to examine the seams in the leafleather canopy overhead  --  anything but meet his eyes . Very well . He would go alone with the giants , and he alone would learn their secrets . " Possibly , " he said coldly , getting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask for some to see to the provisioning of our party . " Then he turned and stalked out of the gathering , back toward his bower . As he did so , he thought he heard someone murmur , " Why waste good food on those already dead ? " More likely , he had imagined it ; nevertheless , he did not stop to find out . Successful hunts , the killing of the grazer  --  all had brought him nothing . When he alone of all the hunters had been brave enough to descend to the giants ' sky-boat he had gained only the accolades of children . Now he would do something so overawing , so incredible ,  |p61that  none would be able to ignore him any longer . He would take the giants to their station-Home and return , or he would die . Maybe that would make them realize his worth , if this time he failed to return . They would be sorry then . In his anger , he stumbled on a protruding rootlet and turned furiously to hurl imprecations at his thoughtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The central fire was well behind him now , and the darkness snuggled close around him . He pulled his cloak down over his head to shield himself from the rain . If the giants felt they could reach their mysterious station , then why should he not feel as confident ? Why not indeed , unless .. . What if there were no station ? What if these two giants were imps of the Lower Hell sent here to tempt him to stray from the Home ? Bah , nonsense ! They were as human as he , despite their great size and strange garb . How else could it be that they spoke the same languageof man ? Though what strange modulations and phrasings they used ! And they did not emfol . Born could not conceive of a person who could not emfol , so he conveniently forgot about it . He parted the leafleather dooring and entered his home , closed it carefully behind him . Untying his cloak , he slung it into a far corner . A muffled sound came from the darkness . Immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hand . A dim figure whimpered . Moving carefully in the blackness , he brought out the little packet of incendiary pollen , sprinkled it over the pile of deadwood in the center of the floor . A touch , and the wood coughed and blazed , revealing the huddled form of Brightly Go . Relaxing , he replaced the knife in its sheath . After a curious glance at the girl , he sat down beside the fire and crossed his legs . Its yellowbrightdepths were soothing , friendly , undemanding . They would leave tomorrow , the giants and he , and he would have liked a long , quiet sleep , but .. . " You come to laugh at me like the others , " he muttered , without rancour . " Oh , no ! " She crawled timidly toward the fire . The light made olivine patterns deep in her eyes , and Born found the attraction of the fire waning steadily . " You know my feelings , Born . " He huffed , turned nervously away . " Losting you like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , Born , " she protested , her voice rising . " I like Losting , yes , but ... I like you as well . Losting is nice , but not nearly so nice as you.  |p62Not  nearly . " She looked at him imploringly . " I do n't want you to do this thing , Born . If you go with the giants you 'll never come back . I believe what everyone says about the dangers so far from Home and what is whispered about the places where the two hells come together . " " Stories , legends , " Born grumbled . " Cub tales . The dangers far from the Home are no different than they are a spear 's throw from this room . Nor do I believe there is a place where the two hells join . But if there is , we will go around it or through it . " She moved around the fire on hands and knees , to sidle close and put one hand on his shoulder . " For me , Born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , he started to lean close , started to agree , started to give in . Then the thing that drove him to lie in wait for grazers and to go down into the depths of wells reached out , interceded , crossed him up . Instead of saying , " I 'll do whatever you desire , Brightly Go , for the love of you , " he whispered huskily , " I 've given my word and said before the whole tribe I will go . And even had I not , I will do this thing . " Her hand slid from his shoulder . She half-mumbled , " Born , I do n't want you to , " then bent over and kissed him before he could draw away . Then she was on her feet and out the door before he could react . The night-rain swallowed her up . He was silent a long time , thinking , as the fire consumed itself and the tepid drops trickled off leafleather roof . Then he mumbled something there was no one to hear , rolled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled , dream-filled slumber . Ruumahum 's left eye opened halfway , cocked sideways . A dark bulk stood on the branch by his resting crevice . He coughed , shook droplets from his muzzle , and snorted in the sibilant rumbling way of the furcot . " Where is your person , cub ? " Muf jerked his head , in imitation of the human gesture , down toward the cluster of enclosed branches below . " Somewhere there , asleep . " " As you should be , nuisance . " The eye closed , and Ruumahum rearranged his massive head on his forepaws . Muf hesitated before blurting out , " Old one , please ? " Ruumahum let out a furcot sigh and lifted his head slightly to facep63the cub , all three eyes open this time . The cub dropped his head and eyed the village sleeping below . " My person , the boy Din , is troubled . " " All persons are troubled , " Ruumahum replied . " Go to sleep . " " He fears for his half-father , the person Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment , " the big furcot mumbled , dropping his head down again . " The cub-person 's emotional reaction is unrea-sonable . " " All cub-persons ' reactions are unreasonable . I fear this time my person 's reaction is reasonable . " Ruumahum 's eyebrows rose . " Offspring of an accident , can it be that you enter into wisdom ? " " I fear , " the cub continued , " the boy-cub-person will do something rash . " " His elders will restrain him , as I would restrain you . I will do worse if you do n't leave me to my rest . " Muf turned to go , looked back over a shoulder , and grumbled defiantly , " Do n't say I did n't tell you of it , old one . " Ruumahum shook his head , wondered why it was that cubs were so questing and inquiring , so disrespectful of an elder 's rest . They rose with questions at all hours and times . The drive to dispel ignorance  --  a drive , he reminded himself , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , but mellowed by experience . Mellowed also by the quiet assurance that death explained everything . He snugged his head back into his crossed paws , ignored the steadilydripping rain , and was instantly asleep again . Born angrily broke off another of the dead branches from the trunk of a tertiary parasite , careful despite his rage not to harm any of the healthy , living shoots . They were four days linear march out from the Home , and his anger at the now distant group of sullen hunters had not abated . But some of the anger was directed inward , at himself for locking himself into this crazy expedition.  |p64Ruumahum  patrolled the hylaea off to Born 's left . He sensed his person 's discomfort and kept his distance . A person made blind by anger was as unpredictable as any of the forest denizens , and one furious at himself the most unpredictable of all . Adding to Born 's discomfort was the initial total incompetence of the giants . They seemed to know nothing of normal walking or climbing . A child held better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , there would already have been some serious falls . What would they do if a brown many-legs or a Buna floater charged them ? Ruumahum moved below them when they came to a more difficult place , but even the furcot 's superfast reflexes might not be enough to stay a fall of several levels . It would take only one such fall to end the expedition . He broke off the last branch , gathered up the wood in his arms , and started back toward the wide section of cubble he had chosen for this evening 's camp . Today it appeared the giants were doing a little better , moving a little less hesitantly through the trees . Cohoma no longer showed the same tendency to slip every time he reached for the next vine , or to overextend his grasp for same . Logan had finally been convinced it was dangerous to reach for each new bloom and plant they passed . Born did not smile as he recalled the incident two days past , when she had sought a drink from the gobletlike vermilliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forearm had kept her from touching it . She had glared angrily at him until he had shown her the minute differences in the vermilliot and the surrounding vermillion plants : the vermilliot had two extra petals , an unusual thickening of the base , a darker red color , and telltale spottingsnear the lip of the cylinder  --  all flaws in otherwise perfect mimicry . Finally he had used the bone knife . Making sure both giants were well clear , he moved above the plant . With the point of the blade he had tipped the green cylinder so that the clear liquid inside spilled free . The vermilliot 's water was clear , but rainwater it was not . The stream struck the meter-thick liana below , splashed , and sizzled , forming a dense cloud that rose into the air . When the mist finally faded , he beckoned them nearer . Cautioning them not to step near the lingering dampness , he showed them the hole the clear liquid had made through a full meter of wood and into the depths beyond . Lastly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bromeliad . They heard the deep , almost metallic bong , utterly unlikep65the soft tap when he struck one of the true vermillions . From that point on neither of the giants so much as brought a finger close to a new growth without first consulting Born . That made him only slightly happier , for innumerable questions slowed them down as effectively as a wound or a broken limb . They moved at perhaps a third of the speed he would have managed alone . With a short jump he dropped down to the huge cubble selected for camp . From the first day , deciding on a camp had proved a problem . It seemed the giants could not tolerate many evenings without shelter from the night-rain . They insisted on protection despite the time and effort it cost , and Born had grudgingly complied . Their excuse was that constant exposure would engender a strange sickness in them , which they called a cold . Born failed to understand . No person could be so fragile . Indigestionwas the only illness he was familiar with , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Home-tree . But the descriptions and assurances of sickness the giants gave him were so horrid he could hardly deny them their necessary protection . " There he is , " he heard Logan say to her companion as he approached . He wondered why they lowered their voices so often , speaking at a less than normal volume . The thought that they might be trying to keep something from him never occurred to him . Anyway , he could hear them clearly enough , even when they conversed in what was called a whisper . Who was he to question the peculiarities of those who could fly through the sky ? Though they might have spent more time , he mused as he dumped the load of wood on the main branch , improving and perfecting their own bodies instead of constructing new artificial ones to shield them from the world . " We were getting a little nervous , Born , " Logan explained with a broad smile . " You 've been gone a long time . " He shrugged , set about constructing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is difficult to find adequate materials for a dry shelter , " he told her . " Most deadwoodand old leaves fall to Hell to be eaten , like all else that falls . " " Eaten 's the word , I 'll bet , " Cohoma agreed , peeling the skin from a large purple spiral . " There should be bacteria down there big as your freckles , Kimi . The amount of dead vegetable matter that must fall to the ground here each day  --  " There was a crash of leaves , and he jumped to his feet . Loganp66hurried to ready the bone spear she had been provided with . It was only Ruumahum . Born smiled as he studied the giants ' expressions . Despite protestations to the contrary , it was clear they would never quite get used to the big furcot 's presence . " Person and furcot come , " the emerald hexapod declared . " Stranger or  --  ? " Born stopped as a tall figure stepped into the light , and his hand moved instinctively for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Ruumahum , was at the man 's side . Losting . The big hunter did not smile as he met Born 's gaze . Logan eyed Born questioningly . He ignored her . Nor did he move his hand from the hilt of his knife . The two furcots exchanged soft growls and moved off to converse on a nearby limb . Losting took a couple of steps forward . " When two lone hunters meet on the trail , " the bigger man said , taking his gaze from Born long enough to study the giants , " it is meet that the one who has made camp invite the latecomer to share with him . " " How come you here , now ? " Born asked sharply , ignoring the question of ritual courtesy for the moment . He looked groundward so Losting could not see the anger in his eyes . " I saw you last standing with Brightly Go as we left the Home . " " That is so , " Losting admitted without gloating . " I think now , as I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , as she will need someone to comfort her and make a life with her when you are dead . " " You did not follow alone for four days to taunt me , " . Born noted tensely . His anger was melting under the illogic of the situation . " Why then did you follow ? " Now it was Losting 's turn to look away . Walking past the two giants , he squatted and rested chin on forearm as he examined the building shelter being built . " I tried to forget what you said that night in council . I could not . Nor could I forget that you alone had gone down into the well in the world , to discover that the blue thing was not a demon , but a thing of axe metal . To discover them . " He nodded at a curiously watching Logan and Cohoma . " I was ashamed I had been afraid , even though the others of our party who had returned are not . They excused themselves by saying you were mad . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Born . " Then when you said you would try to go with these giants to their Home , I too thought youp67mad , Born . And when you left , I was happy , for I had Brightly Go in my arms . " Born tensed , but Losting put up a restraining hand . " I thought how good it would be now , with Brightly Go to myself . How good not to have you around , Born , always to come back with another , greater kill . How good not to have to compete for her with a madman . How good not to fumble with hard words while you always said the soft , proper ones . " The last of Born 's anger vanished . An astonishing thought occurred to him . Could it be that Losting  --  massive , muscular Losting , mighty hunter and warrior Losting  --  could it be that he was jealous of Born ? " I stayed while you left , " the other hunter continued , " but I stayed troubled . When Brightly Go left me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , staring into the world where you had disappeared . Thinking . Ashamed . For , I thought to myself , what if you should reach the giant 's station-Home as you had reached their sky-boat ? What if you should come back with this success on your shoulders ? What then would Brightly Go think of me ? And what , what would I think of myself ? " Losting 's face was twisted . " You persecute me , Born , whether you are near or not . So I found myself thinking , maybe you are mad , but mad and skilled , even still you are no braver than Losting . None is braver than Losting ! So I followed . I will follow to the giants ' home or to the death . You will not have this triumph over me , you will not ! " " Born , what 's this all about ? " Cohoma asked . Logan shushed him . " Ca n't you see it 's personal , Jan ? Something deep between these two . Let 's not intrude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our return , " Cohoma said . " What of this , then ? " Born queried , relaxing a little . " Why do you not continue to follow as before ? Clearly it was the better course of plan . " " And would keep me from your eyes , " Losting finished , without anger . " And you from mine . But we can not go on . " " You 'll not discourage me with  --  " " No , not I , Born . " Losting 's tone was conciliatory . " Not having to pause to construct shelters for the giants , I 've traveled a little ahead of you each day , not behind . I 've only just now come from , " and he named a modest figure , " ahead . What I 've seen prompts me to make contact . " " And what have you seen ? " " Akadi. "  | " I do n't believe you . " " Then keep on this path , and be food for busy mouths . I 've seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about something so serious  --  not even to embarrass Born before Brightly Go . " What 's going on ? " Cohoma finally asked impatiently . " What 's this talk about not going on ? What 's this acoti . . . whatever ? " " Akadi , " Born corrected heavily . " We must go back . " " Now look  --  " Cohoma began , getting to his feet . Logan restrained him , but this time he shook her off . " No , I 'm going to tell these regressivepygmies what I think of ' em . First they make a big show of helpingus . Then they get a little ways away from the home fires , and they have second thoughts . " He turned to Born . " Or maybe you 're getting close to that five-day limit nobody 's ever exceeded and  --  " Suddenly aware he was overdoing his frustration , Cohoma stopped . " You do not know of the Akadi , " Born murmured with quiet fury . " Or you would say only , when do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think that 's  --  " " You talk of delays , and bravery , and intentions . Do you think I 'm risking my life out of the goodness of my heart ? Do you think I 'm doing it for either of you ? I care nothing for the both of you , you huge , cold people ! " He calmed slightly and turned his attention to Cohoma . You are different in size and color and mind . You come to us in a sky-boat of axe metal . I went down the well you made in the world not to save you , but to see what your boat was . To find out things . To please myself . I go to your station for the same reason  --  not to save your lives , but for me , me ! And it is for me that we turn back , for myself and Losting and our people , not for you . You can go on and die , or hide and rot before the column catalogs your scent . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We may never go on again . We must return to the Home . " " Born , " Logan said after a long silence , " we are still ignorant of your ways and much of your world . You must pardon us . What are the Akadi , and why do they force us back ? " " We must warn the Home , " said Losting . " The Akadi may pass it . If so , all will be well . If they do not . . . " He shrugged . " We must try to stop them . " " I believe you , Losting , " Born confessed hesitantly . " But I would have final proof . " He indicated Cohoma and Logan . " And I think itp69would speed our return if the giants were to see the sign of Akadi passing . " Losting nodded agreement and rose . " It is not far , not as far as I would wish . We can be near and return before the water falls . " Both hunters started off down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . Logan stumbled and twisted her way through the clutching thorns and branches and saw-edged leaves . Ruumahum paced below her as a precaution . The first two days had accustomed her to living the death of a thousand cuts every sunrise to sunset , and she was getting toughened . She marveled at how Born never seemed to get cut or scratched despite the thickness of the brambles he led them through . It was positively uncanny . No doubt , she reasoned , it was his smaller size , his lithe build , coupled with the innate knowledge of the hylaea 's construction that enabled him to slip smoothly between the most closely packed webs of leaves and stems and twigs . A bulky green shape appeared next to her . She did n't jump this time , just quivered a little inside . She was growing used to the furcot 's size and silent approach . " Ruumahum , what are the Akadi ? " The furcot sniffed . " A thing that eats . " " One thing , or many ? " " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ruumahum replied . " How can there be thousands and only one ? " Ruumahum growled irritably . " Ask Akadi . " He plunged off the branch and downward . Logan followed his path in her mind 's eye , repeating to herself theatrically , " Into the foliage below ! . . . foliage below . . . foliage below . . . foliage . Fol  --  emfol  --  Empathetic foliation ? Precise terminologyfor an acquired superstition , " she mused . That might explain the term , but not the rationale for the belief 's intensity . She was missingsomething . It would have to wait . Losting had been right , they did not have far to go . Now they were moving through a densely packed thicket of aerial greenery striped with bright yellow . It grew at right angles , forming a living checkerboard . Losting indicated they would have to pass around it , a detour of some dozens of meters . Cohoma put out a hand and grasped the nearest of the interlocking , finger-thick stems . " Why go around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter 's broad-bladed knife . He squeezed the branch . " This stuff isp70herbaceous , soft , pulpy . If we 're in a hurry , why not cut our way through ? " " You consider death with such indifference , " Born told him , eyeing him in much the way Cohoma would study a bug under a microscope . " Can it be that on your own world you are a hunter of sorts , too . " There was a certain unidentifiable stress laid on the word sorts . It was Cohoma 's turn to stare at Born . " It 's just some big succulent . " " It is alive , " Born said patiently . " If we cut through it , it will become not-alive . Why ? To save time ? " " Not only that . If there 's some kind of multiple omnivore around here , I 'd rather not be caught in tight quarters . The more space cleared around me , the better . " Born and Losting exchanged glances . The two furcots waited nearby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , " Born observedwonderingly . " Your priorities are strange , Jancohoma . We will go around . " Cohoma had additional questions , and Logan as well . However , neither Born nor Losting would answer them now . Eventually they rounded the copse of the checkerboard succulents . In another minute they were walking in dense jungle . A turn , cut , and suddenly they entered an unexpected open space , much as Cohoma had wished for , tunneled out of the forest . The tunnel was taller than a man , taller than Logan or Cohoma . It was a good five meters wide , stretching in a straight line to left and right until it merged into green . " Akadi made this . They are mindless and of one purpose . They eat their way through the world , leaving  --  this . " He indicated the clear space . Within that tunnel , life had ceased to exist . It had simply disappeared into . . . what ? " Is the line always so straight ? " Logan asked . " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thicker in another direction , the Akadi swerve and eat in a new path . Once started , nothing turns them but their own hunger . See , " he pointed down the tunnel . " They will eat through anything , consuming anythingliving in their path that can not get out of their way . I have seen them eat through the heart of a Pillar tree and come out the other side . It is said that one can stand by the very edge of their tunnel and , though one could reach out and pull you in , they will not deviate from their chosen path . As those in front are sated , they drop back , letting new members eat themselves full . By the time the last has eaten , the first are hungry again . They stop only to rest and breed . "  |p71Cohoma  looked relieved . " No problem , then , is there ? Do n't tell me you 're concerned because they seem to be heading toward your village ? " Born nodded . The giant spread his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is pack up your kids and furcots and get out of the way until they'veeaten their way through , then move back in , right ? " Born shook his head slowly . " No . The pods will kill some of them , but not very many . You do not understand . We could do what you say , but it is not ourselves we fear for . They are on the village level . They will reach the Home and eat their way through the trunk itself . Once the bark is pierced , they will eat through to the heartwood . The Home will lie defenseless to parasites and disease . It will blacken and die , unless we can stop the column , or turn it . " There was nothing more to be said . They left the tunnel , Logan and Cohoma trailing . " But Born , " Logan persisted , " surely the presence of you two will not make any difference in the defense of the tree ! Two men more . Take us on to our station . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches the Home , devices you ca n't imagine or conceiveof . " " That may be so , " Born conceded , " but we are uncountable days from your station-Home . At their normal speed of destruction the Akadi will reach the Home well before we could reach your station . We must warn the others and help prepare . You will help , too . " " If you think , " Cohoma shot back , " that we 're going to hang around while  --  " " Of course we 'll do what we can , Born , " Logan said soothingly , after a sharp glance at her partner . " We 'll be honored to help after what you 've already done for us . " She put a hand on Cohoma 's shoulder and held him back . They dropped behind Born . " What the hell 's the matter with you , Kimi ? " whispered Cohoma angrily . " If you 'd just let me argue with them a little more I might have convinced them that we 're of no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch and we 'd  --  " " You shortsighted idiot ! We 've no choice but to cooperate . We might as well . If this defense of the tree fails , we 're as dead as if the Akadi had eaten us . Or do you think we can make it through this greenhouse Hades without help ? You 've seen what it 's like . We 'd be dead a dozen times over by now if it were n't for Born . Remember the false bromeliad I thought was full of water that turned out to be full ofp72acid ? We 'll fight , sure . If it begins to look as hopeless as Born makes it sound , why , then we 'll have plenty of time to skip clear . " She stepped carefully over a magenta and blue fungus . " Until then , we 'd better do our best to see that they survive . Unless you 'd prefer to strike out on your own . " " Okay , I was n't thinking , " Cohoma admitted . " I 'll go along as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying for any damn tree . I 'd rather take my chances in the hylaea . " Born would have wondered at this strange talk , but at the moment his mind was filled with thoughts that drowned out any other sound . The Akadi were marching toward the Home , marching toward Brightly Go . He suspected the giants would not fight to the death , if it came to that . He did not bother to tell them that once the Akadi had their scent , they would follow the smell of an enemy until it dropped . Once the conflict was joined and the Akadi senses heightened , all within range of their olfactory sense were doomed to death , unless the Akadi died first . If they somehow managed to stop the ravaging columnand the giants discovered this information , they could berate Born all they wished . Brightly Go had hurried back from gleaning the Home when word of Born 's return reached her . She saw him talking excitedly with Sand and Joyla and started toward him , pleased and surprised at his sudden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them and talking easily with Born as well as with the elders . She slowed , stopped , stared for a long moment . Then she whirled and began walkingslowly back toward the house of her parents . Now and then she would glance back over her shoulder , talk quietly to herself , and shake her head . " How long ? " asked Sand solemnly . " Two days march for a man , " Losting told them , gesturing back into the forest . " No chance they will pass to one side or the other ? " Born shook his head . " None . " " They 'll cut right through the middle of your village . " Born turned as they were joined by the two giants and Reader . " You 're all seeing this cockeyed , " Cohoma continued . " You 're going to sacrifice yourselvestrying to save a tree ? Listen , how long would it take for the tree to die when the Akadi have finished with it , eaten their way through ? "  |p73It  was Reader 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps a hundred years . " Cohoma 's face mirrored his feelings . " You could raise two or maybe three more generations here , be searching safely in small armed groups for a new tree . But if you stay and fight these Akadi , you 'll all die , it seems . What 's the point of that ? " " The Home will live , " explained Joyla with dignity . " Right , " commented Cohoma bitterly . " Throw away your lives for a damned holy vegetable . " He directed his words to Logan . " They 're not human enough to be repatriated to the Commonwealth any more . They 've regressed too far . The normal survival factor 's been bred and cut out of them by this dunghill . " The chief shook his head sadly while both hunters simply studied the giants as they would a new variety of Chollakee . " Giants who claim to come from another world , I do not understand you . It may be as you say , we are more different than we ap-pear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " Joyla and Sand nodded in unison . " We do n't pretend to understand you completely , " Logan admitted in a conciliatory tone , while Cohoma cursed softly . " But some of our ways might be of some help to you . " " We certainly will consider any suggestions you would like to make , " Sand replied politely . " Okay , " she said enthusiastically , " the way I understand it , the only thing these Akadi will turn for is to defend themselves against an attacker , right ? " " That is so , " Born told her . " Well then , " she continued brightly , " why not hit this column from the side . Once they turn to defend themselves , wo n't they continue on the new pathway ? " Sand smiled , shook his head . " The Akadi remember . They would pursue and kill any creature foolish enough to assault them , then return to their original line of march . " " Oh , " Logan murmured , crestfallen . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would gain would be a little time . " " A very little time , " Losting added . " Swell , terrific , " a frustrated Cohoma put in . These regressed midgetswere getting on his nerves . Here they had actually found someonep74to guide them back to the station and safety , and now this ridiculous bit of logic demanded they kill themselves off trying to save a tree for the fourth generation , instead of simply picking up and moving for a day or so . It went against reason ! But despite his earlier outburst , Cohoma had no illusions about their chances in the jungle by themselves . They would end up in the grip of some cyanide-spitting cabbage , or something equally bizarre . He took a deep breath . It was essential , then , that these Akadi be destroyed . To that end , both he and Logan were vocal in volunteering their full cooperation . If the fight was won , they would get credit for great bravery and comradeship . If it were lost , well , they would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akadi 's ability to follow the scent of their enemy down to the last straggler . The two giants willingly helped raise the ramparts of sharpened ironwood stakes that were wedged and then tied with woven vine into place on the side of the Home were the Akadi assault was expected to take place . The bristling poisoned stakes and spines would blunt , not halt , the Akadi surge . The latter would overwhelm such pedestrian defenses by sheer weight of numbers , the living using their dead and impaled cousins as a bridge . But the inhabitants of the great tree had other defenses , defenses which , despite their considerable experience in researching the vegetationof this world , Cohoma and Logan were unfamiliar with . What , for example , was the purpose of the large nuts twice the size of a terran coconut that had been gingerly suspended over the cubbles the Akadi would use to enter the tree ? Unlike the mountain of deadly jacari thorns and tank seed pods which had been gathered , there was nothing in the nuts to hint at concealed deviltry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious , yet brilliant , solution . He overlooked something Logan did not  --  the fact that while Born 's people were primitive , they were not stupid . " Why not , " he suggested to a small group of busy men , " just cut away all the vines and cubbles and lianas leading into the Home tree ? Unless these Akadi can fly , too , they 'll be forced to go around . " By way of reply , Jaipur , an elderly craftsman , handed Cohoma a finely honed bone axe and directed him to try it on the nearest big liana , which was about as big around as a man 's thigh . Cohoma proceeded to do just that , hammering away at the incredible substance for a good ten minutes . The axe blade was finally dulled to the pointp75where it would no longer cut . All he had achieved was a notch barely a couple of centimeters deep in the protective bark . " You might have guessed , Jan , " Logan reminded him , " that none of the natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no chance of success , even a vine . " Jaipur made an expansive gesture , grinning a crooked grin out of one side of his face . The other had been paralyzed by an encounter in childhood with a certain spiny plant . " There are many thousands of such pathways , twining and entwining , leading to the Home from every direction . Many are far thicker than a furcot 's body . There are not enough axes in the Home , or enough time in the world to cut them all , could they be so cut . " Before moving to sharpen yet another ironwood spear Jaipur also showed Cohoma how each cubble had six others supporting it . Cutting one or two without cutting its dozen or more supports would be a waste of time . " You 'd need a tripod rifle to make a start , " Logan observed . " Hell , the undergrowth here is so entangled you 'd have to cut down half the forest to make a decent gap between it and the tree . " Reader passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Akadi could cross considerable open spaces without any supportby forming a living bridge of interlocked bodies . This story of their rending alien limbs engendered a desire in both Cohoma and Logan for a little more instruction in the handling of available weaponry . Both had been presented with ironwood spears , plus bone axe and knife . Logan would have preferred a snu f ? er , but the bazookalike blowguns required time and skill to make . There were n't enough for all who knew how to use them . They would have been abashed to know that one reason they had not been offered snufflers was that Born had convinced the chiefs that in a difficult spot , they were more likely to prick themselves on one of the toxic thorns than kill Akadi . Requests for a more detailed description of the enemy resulted in Born 's displaying an unexpected talent for illustration . Using a white chalklike substance , he drew on a plate of polished black wood . " You must try to strike here , " he instructed them , " between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Born continued , " is about half the size of a man . . . myself . " " About the size of a German shepherd , " Cohoma mused . Born went on . An Akadi had a thick flexible body with no tail ; itp76walked on six thin but very powerful legs , each leg terminating in a single long , curved claw that enabled the Akadi to scurry slothlike along any part of a branch or cubble . The front of the body tapered slightly , ending in double jaws with no neck , surrounded by muscle . The double jaw arrangement fascinated Logan . One set worked up and down in the usual fashion , while the opposing ones moved from left and right . Working in unison they created a biting phalanx which could cut through the toughest wood or bone as neatly as a laser could slice sheet metal . The teeth set in the upper and lower jaws were triangular and razoredged , while those on the side were square , serrated on top , and curved slightly backward to shove food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the head , lay just back of the jaws . There were three tentacles , one on either side of the head and another below that were equipped with jagged , tearing suckers on the tips for holding prey . In color the Akadi were a distinctive rusty orange , eyes and legs bright black . Despite the triple oculars their sight was rumored to be poor . " This is countered somewhat by their sense of smell and of touch , " Born concluded , " which is very good indeed . " " An eating machine in multiples , " Logan declared quietly . " Very well designed , very efficient . " She shook her head , murmured , " God on a seat , I would n't care to tangle with one of them . And we have to fight thousands . " She looked evenly at Born . " You people really think you can stop something like this armed with a few glorified blowguns and spears ? " " No , " said Born , wiping the polished wood clean with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He turned to leave . " There 's no hope for them , no hope at all , " a disgusted Cohoma blurted when Born was out of earshot . " There 's not much left for us , either , Jan . " They heard the sound while they were resting just outside the first ring of the Home 's pod-laden vines . Initially it was only a soft rustlingp77in the distance , like wind moving through far-off branches . It grew steadily louder , became a hum , a buzzing like a billion bumblebees aswarm at a new nest . It intensified , swelled , and resolved into a deafening crackling sound neither Cohoma nor Logan would ever be able to forget . The sound of hundreds of tons of organic matter vanishing down innumerablethroats . A familiar form bounded up from a liana below . " Be ready , giants . The Akadi near , " Losting advised them . Logan 's grip tightened on the shaft of the ironwood spear and she checked to make certain bone axe and knife were still strapped securely to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get close enough to one of the carnivores to use either . They would run before that . Losting moved to go by them . Cohoma gestured at him to pause . " We have n't seen Born for a couple of days now , Losting . I know he 's been busy . Is he manning another part of the line ? " " Born . " Losting 's face went through several changes of expression ranging from satisfaction to disgust . " You 've not see Born for some days because he 's been gone for some days . " Losting clearly relished the shock on the faces of the two giants . " He left the Home one night and has neither been seen nor heard from since . It is certain he did not go toward the Akadi . We have had scouts out marking their progress toward the Home . His furcot has vanished with him . " The implication was clear  --  the hunter had run . " Born , a coward ? " Logan sounded confused . " That does n't make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was the only one who would come down to our skimmer . " " Those who are mad act for reasons of their own , which no man can comprehend , " Losting countered . " Your sky-boat was an unknownquantity , unlike the Akadi , who are known too well . With them , one knows exactly what to expect . Death , most likely . Born is a hunter and a solitary person by habit . If the Home dies and the village dies with it , he could survive alone . There is no doubt he is the cleverest among us . " His expression darkened . " But he has not been clever in this , for if there is any village to come back to , he will not be allowed to live among us . The chiefs and the shaman have ordained this already . " He spun . Gripping the vine nearby , he swung himself up to the branch immediately above to check on the readiness of the defendersthere.  | " I still do n't believe it , " Logan whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider myself a better judge of human nature than that . " " I told you they 'd abandoned their humanity in making concessions to this world , " Cohoma grumbled . " Oh , come on , Jan ! How could they have regressed so much in so short a time ? The earliest colony ships only go back a few hundred years . " She quieted . " I could swear I had that Born figured . " " There 's another possibility , you know , Kimi , " Cohoma ventured after a pause . He eyed her appraisingly . " Even someone like Losting , who does n't like him , admits he 's a smart boy . Maybe . . . maybe he 's figuring on us bailing him out . " Logan looked at her companion curiously . " How do you mean ? " " Well , think a minute , " he said , warming to the subject . " He 's out there somewhere "  --  he gestured back through the palisade of sharpenedstakes toward the other end of the village  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes as badly as everyone expects . We circle clear as soon as the end is in sight . He joins us , we make it to the station , he gets that burning curiosity of his satisfied plus he saves his life . " " That would imply , " she countered vociferously , " that he cares nothing for his Home or his friends . I do n't believe that . I think the tie is as strong , if not stronger , in Born than in any of these folk . I could understand such an attitude in some soldier-of-fortune , the kind of gun for hire you might meet in the back streets of Drallar or LaLa or Repler , but not in Born . " Cohoma grinned . " I think you see a little too much of the noble savage in our stunted cousins . Our friend Born is just resourceful enough to make the break , just iconoclastic enough to  --  " The first line of Akadi broke through the dense wall of green and all conversation died . The column measured seven or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared in verdure . They were packed body to body , so close that the front resembled a single monstroussnake , all woolly orange fur , clawed legs , weaving tentacles . Filteredgreen light shone on orbs like ebony cabochons , dark wells of unsapient malignance . Tiny explosive pops sounded as the ring of carefully positioned hunters let loose with a dozen tank seeds at once . The Akadi crumpled , tentacles and clawed legs digging in blind fury at the prickingthorns , chewing at themselves . Even before the frantic flailings ofp79legs and tentacles ceased , the first row had been shoved aside and tumbled and bounced off branches and epiphytes into the depths below . A metropolis of scavengers was going to form beneath this place , Cohoma reflected . While the first dozen hunters reloaded , the second group fired and more Akadi died . Then the first fired , and the second reloaded . Such elementary tactics were only temporarily effective . It was like fighting the sea , wave upon wave , a living red-orange ocean of suckers and teeth moving forward as though squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firing of the snufflers grew more erratic , less deadly . Now men and women armed with long lances of ironwood moved forward to stab and cut at the furry bodies . Others holding axes and clubs stood ready around the spearmen , prepared to fend off any Akadi that tried to escape the spears on either side , above or below . The blood of the Akadi , Logan noted with the eye of a trained observer , was a dark dirty green , like thick pea soup with streaks of brown in it . The spears were more effective than she would have thought . Each time one of them moved , an Akadi died , clutching briefly with tentacles and claws until the lance was drawn free . Logan had to admire the efforts of the tribe , regressed or not . While the hunters high in the branches used their snufflers to pick off as many of the attackers as possible , the forward rank of the Akadi army , reduced in strength , ran into the wall of spears , were punctured and cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green grave . The spirited defense would have worked but for one overriding factor . There was an endless number of Akadi . The furry killers perished by the dozens , the hundreds . But the river of death never stopped , never slowed or rested , but bored steadily onward . Eventually there would be a pause while a couple of the hunters waited for a fresh supply of thorns and tank seeds to be brought up to them . Now and then one of the spearmen would grow too tired to strike any longer and would have to be replaced by a reserve . Then the Akadi would gain another few centimeters , would press the line of ironwood back a little further . Nor were casualties absent among the defending people . A man or woman might tire and slip on the never-too-certain footing of cubble and branch and would have top80be helped back by companions . Another few centimeters lost , if not the defender . Given an endless supply of jacari thorns and tank seeds , and inhuman reserves of strength , Cohoma estimated the tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could n't prevent the omnivores from gaining ground . Once a centimeter of footing was lost to the invaders , it could not be regained . That living torrent would not be forced back . But the line held , held with the determination of churchmen . Those in the front rank who finally collapsed from exhaustion continued to be replaced . Yet , there were only so many fighters in the village , and now the replacements were growing fatigued as well . Occasionally an Akadi would slip under a faltering spear to grab a leg or arm with steely tentacles . Then an axeman would have to hurry to cut the monster away , for once having a grip they would let go only in death . Steadily the little knot of humans was forced backward , back toward the tree-vines themselves which formed the natural and last line of defense for the Home-tree . Once through the pods , the Akadi would begin devouring the body of the tree itself . Then it would be only a matter of minutes before irreparable damage was done . Logan knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final futile effort to push the Akadi back . For a moment , heads , and arms would rise above the writhing tentacles . Then all  --  men , women , children  --  would be engulfed by the unthinking mass , leaving the tree to perish despite their sacrifice . The fighting raged continuously . It was not as noisy as a war betweenmen would have been , but neither was it silent . Along the line of spearmen , men and women shouted encouragement to each other , defiance at their dog-sized tormentors , while the Akadi pressed blindly forward , chattering like a million castanets . Slowly , grudgingly , the people gave way to the pressure of the untiringAkadi . The army was three or four meters from the first winding pod-vine when shouts traveled up and down the line of defenders . Logan recognized the voices of the shaman and the chiefs Sand and Joyla , that of Losting , and several other hunters . A sudden flurry of thorns from the snuiiers held the Akadi for a moment while the line parted and fell to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living stream moved on , eating as it went . They began to gnaw at the nourishing bark of the tree , eager for the living wood beneath , as others rushed on to the first vines.  |p81Cohoma  felt a hand at his arm , saw one of the hunters pulling at him . The man 's tone was urgent . He followed him into higher branches , Logan with them . Even as they ran , she turned to gaze over her shoulder as a shout rose behind them . She saw the big nuts dropping , to land and burst among the slithering line of Akadi . As they burst , a fine powder gushed forth . It shone iridescent in the light of the receding sun . The Akadi slowed , stopped , began to paw among themselves with legs and thrashing tentacles . They tumbled over and over on each other , fell and rolled on their backs , beating against one another , against the wood of the Home , in a sudden , inexplicable frenzy . Cohoma found himself racing down toward the Akadi with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and stab again . He was amazed at the ease with which it punctured the surprisingly soft bodies . Green blood covered his lance . Nearby he saw Logan stabbing and hacking with her own spear . A violent pain stabbed through his ankle . Looking down he saw that one of the Akadi had somehow slipped clear of the re-formed line of spearmen and had locked three tentacles firmly around his leg . Multipleteeth were chewing at his lower calf . He tried to get his spear around , could n't and found himself falling as his damaged leg gave way under him . Then something cut the creature between the second and third eye , pierced completely through the nightmare shape . " Thanks , Kimi . Jesus , get it off me ! " She stabbed again and green ichor squirted all over them , but the triangular teeth refused to relinquish their grip . Eventually she had to use an axe to cut the tentaclesclear and then pry the jaws apart . Bright red circles covered his calf where the suckers had held . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankle . Using Logan as support , he limped clear of the fight . A small bottle of spray from their one survival kit stopped the bleeding . Coagulation set in immediately . A simple selfadhesivebandage was slapped into place . " Did n't see where the bugger came from , " he told her through clenched teeth . Sweat was standing out on his forehead and he wiped it off . Logan studied the wound beneath the transparent bandage . " You 're going to have a square scar . Going to be fun explaining that . " " I hope I have someone to explain it to . . . " His words were drowned out by a roar that shook the Home-tree it/self . The band of humans redoubled their efforts as they were joined by dozens of powerful green shapes , A massive paw would rise and descend . Every time it did so , an Akadi would die , spine or skull crushed . For once the furcots roused themselves en masse from their daily sleep . For once their services were offered without consideration or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akadi . Logan recognized Geeliwan , Losting 's furcot , among them ; but there was no sign of Ruumahum . One enormous furcot rose up from the midst of the fray with several Akadi hanging from him , their tentacles seeking vainly for a vulnerableplace in that thick fur , teeth snapping and biting futilely . A second furcot appeared alongside the first , began picking the furious Akadi off its companion 's body , and methodically crushing them . Occasionally a furcot would be submerged by the stream , only to rise and dip like a breaching whale . However , thick fur , tough hide , and tremendous strength could not prevail forever against the untiring army . Every so often a furcot would disappear in the orange-red river of death and not rise again . Then , when it happened , it was unmistakable . " Look ! " Cohoma grasped at Logan for support and pointed . " They 're turning back , retreating . They 've been beaten ! " Indeed , the Akadi had ceased moving forward , were in fact movingbackward , back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They took nothing with them , leaving their dead and dying behind and trampling the injured and maimed in their retreat . Now the people of the Home , some too exhausted to move , watched as their more energetic comrades moved about with axes and clubs  --  carefully , lest they slip on the blood-soaked cubbles and branches  --  dispatching those of the killers too crippled to flee . The furcots gathered to themselves , idly killing a still biting Akadi , licking and grooming each other 's wounds . Some hunted through the branches and vines for those of the brethren who would no longer gather with them . The exhilaration was temporary . Logan and Cohoma watched as the human survivors went among the legion of corpses , carefully searching among the mutilated and bleeding for any who still lived . Some were missing arms and legs , others heads or parts of same , while still others lay with their insides strewn over bright green leaves and blossoms , still beautiful in the last rays of the distant setting sun.  | " By the Ordainments , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me regret  --  " " Shussh , " Logan cautioned him , nodding at the big hunter walking toward them . A series of square-edged gashes decorated one side of his chest . Some had been crudely bandaged with long thin strips of a certain leaf . A snuffler rested loosely on his right arm and he carried a club in the other . There was hardly a centimeter of his body that was not covered with the tiny crimson circlets left by the probing suckers of the Akadi . " You beat them . . . in spite of everything , " Logan said , when it appeared the hunter was about to walk past them . " Beat them ? " Losting turned to stare wildly at them , and they recoiled at the naked blood-fury in his eyes . " Beat them  --  no . Do you think they stopped because of our efforts ? " He hesitated . " We slowed them , true . It was a good fight . One I 'd be proud to tell to my children . We slowed them enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But stopped them , no . They stopped themselves . " " Stopped themselves ! " Logan blurted in spite of herself . " Look about you , " Losting advised . " What do you see ? " Both giants turned their attention back to the battlefield . " Very little , " Logan told him . " It 's getting too dark . " " Yes , it is getting too dark . For the Akadi as well as us . They have stopped because the day is at its end . While the night-rain falls they will sleep , to rise again tomorrow and come on with as much determinationas they did today . We have only so many jacari for the snufflers , only so much blood . I do not see us holding them for another night . But we will try . We would not have stopped them today but for the furcots  --  and for this . " He bent and reached down with the tip of the club , apparently slippingits flatter side under something . Logan and Cohoma leaned forward . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight reflected off something tiny and bright as a jewel . " That little thing ? " she wondered , reaching forward with a thumb . " I can squash it like an ant . " Losting moved the club aside before she did just that . " I 'm not fond of you giants , though you fought well enough this day . But I would not allow my worst enemy to touch the seed of the adderut . " Rising , he looked around until he found a severed tentacle of a dead Akadi . He brought it back and laid it before them.  | " Watch . " He tilted the club , shook it gently . The tiny metallichued , multilegged thing slid onto the tentacle . As soon as it made contactit seemed to disappear . Cohoma stared harder in the fast fading light . " Where 'd it go ? " " Look hard . " Nothing happened . Then Cohoma thought he detected a slight swelling under the skin of the tentacle . Several minutes passed , during which the swelling became a bulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lostingtook out his knife and used it to touch the top of the bulge . The taut skin burst and a tiny purple ball popped out . It began rolling , rolling , toward the edge of the branch . He put out the club and stopped it , rolled it back . Cohoma and Logan could just see a tiny , many-legged spot near the base of the bloated globe  --  the original gemlike creature . " That is the dust of the adderut , " Losting explained . " When it bursts , it scatters millions of these , " and he indicated the tiny bug . " If they touch wood or plant , nothing happens . But should they touch flesh , whether of man or furcot or Akadi , they burrow into it and . . . eat . Ah , how they eat ! " This last was uttered with enough relish to make Logan slightly ill . Cohoma was feeling none too well himself . This revelation was enough to make even an experienced , detached observer a little queasy . " See , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the club , " how it moves , tries to run . The flesh under the skin where it burrows is quickly softened and consumed by the dust-bug . When one of these scrambles clear of its host and falls to a soft plant , the legs bury in and become roots . The pulp contained in this gross obscene body turns green as it is converted into food . Eventually the sac bursts and a new adderut plant grows on a new host . " " Fascinating , " admitted Logan , who was turning slightly green herself . She was enough of a scientist to hold on to her last meal . But somehow this botanical marvel nauseated her in a way the day-long carnage had not . She could imagine several of them landing on her own body , digging in , eating . " Are they mobile little plants , " she asked hurriedly , " or insects , or what ? " " Maybe a little of both , " Cohoma suggested . " You 've noticed the preponderance of green in animal life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm beginning to think , Kimi , that the usual clear-cut dividingline between plant and animal may not exist on this world . "  | " Even so , " she replied , " this is one line of research I 'll be glad to let somebody else pursue when we get back to the station . " Losting was not sure of the meaning of all their words . " True , they are dangerous things to fight with . One must work hard to emfol an adderut . If one should burst while being cut clear . . . " He did n't need to finish the thought . " No wonder the Akadi column halted , " Logan observed . " That whole forward section must have been literally eaten inside out in a couple of minutes . " She looked nervously at the wooden ground they were standing on . " What happens to the millions of those things that did n't get anything to eat ? Are we going to find them in bed tonight ? " Losting shook his head . " Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to find sustenance immediately upon release die quickly . All will be dead before the sun is down . You need not fear them . Nor , " he added regretfully , " need the Akadi . We have no more adderuts . They grow far apart and infrequently . Though I wish for a thousand now , I can not honestly say this makes me sorry . " Logan stepped on the pulsating monstrosity . It burst , purple-green dye staining the wood of the branch . They followed the hunter back into the village . " What happens tomorrow , then ? " Logan asked . " Is it completely hopeless ? " " There is always hope till the last is dead , " Losting reminded them . That did not seem encouraging to the giants . " We have our snufflers , " he said as he hefted the green wood weapon meaningfully , " and our spears and axes and our furcots . Then there are still the pollen-pods of the Home itself . After they are gone . . . " He shrugged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He left them . Logan looked after him while Cohoma muttered , " That 's great . . . commendable . I think we 'll do better taking our chances  --  poor as they may be  --  in the forest . I do n't feel quite so indebted to this noble tree . " He looked around at the sheltering trunklets . " At least we 'll die on the way home , not in defense of some stinking vegetable ! " Exhaustion had a single advantage . Sleep was no problem for even the most worried of the humans in the Home . The last drops were still making their way down from the upper levels of the canopy as the tired tribe of humans once more prepared for the Akadi assault . Once again the hunters took up their positions high in the branches , snufflers ready , making quiet promises that eachp86precious jacari would take an Akadi with it . When the toxic thorns were gone , they would lay snufflers aside and move down with axes and clubs to fight alongside their families . And once more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path along which the Akadi army would soon crawl  --  set themselves there knowing that those who should back them up now lay supine in the village , unmoving , asleep . Cohoma and Logan took places well up in the curve of one of the major Home-tree branches . They would have an excellent view of the coming fight , be a little less anxious to throw themselves into battle . If Losting 's pessimism was borne out , they would work their way back into the village , gather what was available in the way of provisions , and circle around the Akadi column . Then they would strike off southwest by compass , toward the distant station . Maybe they would reach it , maybe not , but at least they would have their chance . Logan thought she heard a distant , feathery rustling far back in the undergrowth . The Akadi were rising , shaking off the lethargy of night , getting ready to ravage and destroy and kill again . The giants readied themselves , as did the snuffler-armed hunters . So did the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scouts out to warn of the Akadi 's approach . They were not needed . A few moments of advance warning meant nothing now . It was known where they would come from . Every man , woman , and child hefted a weapon and stared at the green hole in the forest . Logan whispered to her partner , her knuckles around the shaft of the spear turning white . " Remember , if the tribe starts going under , we get out fast . " " What makes you think the vine barrier will open for us ? " " There 'll be some last-ditch fighters going through . Remember , the vines are the tree 's last line of defense . We can always grab a kid from the line and use him . Besides , " she added coolly , " we 've been eating the fruit from this tree for several days . We might have accumulated enough of the appropriate chemicals for the tree to recognize us , too . " The rustling increased , but it seemed at once louder and more distant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as complex as anger , she wondered ? Were they preparing themselves with some furious war cries and speeches ? What kind of brains did those orange horrors possess ? Did all thoughts fuse in a single mindlessmalignancy , or were they capable of emotions beyond desire for killing , eating , and sleep ? She had no way of telling.  |p87Long  moments came and went , and the volume of distant castanetlikesounds neither diminished nor increased , was loud enough to drown out all other forest sounds . Those manning the line of spears before the green tunnel were showing signs of edginess now . The huntersin the branches shifted constantly , nervously into new positions . All the while the sun climbed higher in the green sky . And still that orifice of hell declined to reveal its multiple horror . Then there was a definite , if slight , motion detected at the far end of the tunnel , and shouts sounded up and down the line of defenders  --  shouts almost of relief . For it was the steady , nerve-breaking waiting that eroded the determination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse by far than actual battle . However , there was no mass trembling in the herbaceous fronds fringing the tunnel 's mouth , no swaying of branches under massed weight . A few leaves rustled lightly as the first shape became visible . But it was not the Akadi . A human shout came from the tunnel , rising above the maddening din of the Akadi . A second shape appeared alongside the first , thick green fur matted with rain , triple eyes half-closed in sleep . The hunters slid their snufflers off their shoulders and stared , their eyes widening in shock as Born and Ruumahum walked slowly out of the tunnel . Born 's cautionary cry proved unnecessary . Everyone was too paralyzed to think of prematurely letting loose with a thorn . If the Akadi had rushed from the tunnel then , no one would have raised a hand against them . Then there was a noisy , mass rush , and Born was surrounded by men and women , cursing and questioning him at once . Ruumahum loped off unnoticed . While the humans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Born , the furcot joined his silent brethren and commenced an explanation in his steady , grumbling tones . " What happened . . . We thought you 'd run . . . Where did you go . . . What of the Akadi . . . What of . . . ? " the persons asked Born . " Please , could I have a drink ? " A container of water was passed up to him . Ignoring the continuous babble of questions , he put the wooden cylinder to his lips and drank long and deep . Then he turned it upside down and let the rest of the tepid liquid cascade over him . A deep , commanding voice finally rose above the noise  --  that ofp88shaman Reader . " Hunters , to your posts . Re-form your spear line , people of the Home ! The Akadi  --  " Born shook his head tiredly . " I do n't think the Akadi will bother us again . Not for a long while , anyway . " He smiled softly as a fresh wave of astonishment passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stimulationcame from Ruumahum 's information . " He gestured over to where the furcots were gathered . " He 'd been out hunting , ranging far to the north . I do n't know why , he is n't sure why , but he brought back word of what he 'd found , and that prompted a thought in my mind . I thought it might work . " " What might work ? " several people asked at once . " Why did n't you tell  --  ? " " Why did n't you tell someone you were going , Born ? " came the voice of Brightly Go . She pushed into the circle of people . " Would it have mattered ? There would have been loud objections , arguing , demands that I remain to lend my snuffler to the fighting . I would rather have you think me a coward and mad , and laugh at me . I 'm used to being laughed at . If my scheme had not worked , nothing else would have mattered , would it ? " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been respected in the village as the cleverest of hunters , and simultaneouslyderided as the maddest of thinkers . Now it seemed he might have produced a miracle , so there were some embarrassed stares . " It was not far away , down on the mid-Fifth Level . " " What was ? " Joyla boomed , her penetrating voice not to be ignored . " A way of stopping the Akadi . " " Miracle or no miracle , this truly is madness , " Reader thought aloud . " Nothing stops the Akadi  --  nothing ! " His voice was adamant . " In my youth I saw a column rip apart a herd of grazers . The furcot can not stand before them . It is said even the demons of the Lower Hell respect a wandering column . " There were murmurs of respect from the crowd . " What could you find , Born , on the Fifth Level , or any level , that could stop the Akadi ? " " Come , and I 'll show you , " he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken but a few steps when he realized no one was following . For the first time now , the exhaustion and effort ofp89the past days was forgotten , and his face spread in a wide grin of satisfaction . " Are you all afraid ? " Go into the tunnel ? The tunnel from which the children of hell had poured only the evening before ? On the word of a madman ? It would take more than a little courage . Losting was the first to step forward . He was as fearful as the rest , but he had no choice  --  Brightly Go stood there , watching . Then the crippled Jhelum followed , limping on his injured leg . Almost to the step , Reader and Sand and Joyla joined him . The little knot of humanitymoved down the winding tunnel . They walked down the green tube , its floor and walls and ceiling formed as if by a colossal drill . As they did so the noise of angry Akadi grew louder , loud to the point where one had to lean close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sharp bend in the tunnel , an unexpected bend unlike the usual paths of the Akadi . Born stopped and gave directions . A few chops with axes broke through the roof of saliva-cemented growth , and they emerged into the open forest again . Born beckoned them first upward , and then on again . Finally he went on ahead , alone , then returned with an admonition to the others to be silent and to follow . After carefully and silently crawling along a thick twisted limb , they were staring down at an eldritch carnival , an orgiastic celebration of death unrivaled except in legend . A second roofed-over tunnel , its faintly translucent ceiling snaking back many meters into distant forest , intersected the tunnel they had just come through . Where the two tunnels joined , Akadi precision and order had become chaos . The Akadi column from the north and lower level was composed of slightly smaller , redder horrors . They had dark stripes encircling their abdomen . Where they met the first column the tunnels were shattered , spilling the combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle dozens of meters in diameter . Within that circle , nothing existed save stripped wood and dead , dying , fighting Akadi . Green blood drenched everything . " Ruumahum found the column , " Born told them softly . " And I had the thought . What could stop the Akadi , but the Akadi ? We attackedbefore morning when they were sluggish and slow . We stayed within strong scent range and they followed . Now they will continue to fight till only a few of each column are left . These few will be too weakp90and disorganized to offer any threat to the Home . We can easily kill any who attack , and we have finished with not one , but two threats . " " But how did you get them here so fast ? " Reader wondered . " I was afraid I would not have enough powder , but Ruumahum continued to fetch more and more dry wood to keep the torches going . I stayed close enough to the lead Akadi to keep them awake . They followed and the others blindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept nor rested for two days and nights . I think , " he finished , sitting down on the branch , " I had better rest now . " Joyla and Reader grabbed him as his completely drained body fell from the branch . Born opened his eyes , saw a monster Akadi staring down at him . He sat up like a bursting pod and blinked , rubbing at his eyes . " About time you came around , " Logan commented , stepping back from his mat . " You do n't even recover slowly , do you ? " Born looked around . He was in one of the rooms in the chief 's multi-chambered quarters . " You 've been out , " she added , " for about eighteen hours . " " Hours ? " He eyed her questioningly , his mind still fuzzy with sleep . " A day and a half , and I do n't wonder , with what they tell me you went through . " Born had only one thought . " Have I missed the Longago  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Cohoma was sitting and sharpening a knife . " You know anything about a burying time , Jan ? " Her companion shook his head . Born sat up and grabbed her by the shoulder of her blouse and nearly fell . The tough material did n't tear , supported him . " No , Born , " a strong voice replied . " You have preserved too many lives for us to proceed with the Longago without you . Now that you are returned to us , it can be done tonight . " " What 's this Longago  --  some kind of ceremony ? " Logan asked , glancing behind her toward Joyla , who stood in the portal.  | " It is a returning . Those who were killed by the Akadi must be given back to the world . " She looked over at Born . " There are many who must be returned . It has taken this long to find enough of TheyWho-Keepto take so many . The boy Din is among them . " Seeing the sudden change of expression that passed cloudlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you feel now ? You have slept long , and sometimes  --  " " All right . . . I 'm all right , " Born mumbled , letting go his grip on Logan . He tried to stand , staggered slightly , then sat down hard on the woven mat and held his head in both hands . This did not keep it from spinning , but it helped . " I 'm hungry , " he said abruptly . Since his head was proving uncooperative , he would concentrate on less intractable portions of his anatomy . " There 's food , " Joyla said simply , beckoning him into the next room . " Do you need help to  --  " " For half a Home fruit I would crawl on my belly , dragged by my nails , " he answered . Moving slowly , he rose from the bed . Logan got out of his way . Still weaving , he walked unaided into the room from which a host of smells issued . Joyla held him steady on the other side . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nourishment too soon , " she advised him , and then she grinned . " Or I will have this room to clean yet again . And you will have to start afresh . " Born nodded without really hearing her . He stumbled into the room , where fruit , fresh meat , and preserved pulp was laid out in abundance on the eating mat . Joyla beckoned to Cohoma and Logan , indicating they might as well eat too . " Thanks , " Logan replied . " You can watch him as he eats and restrain him . " " Why do n't you ? " Logan asked , as she sat down at the edge of the mat and selected a bright yellow gourd-shaped fruit with blue striping . Joyla shook her head , studied Born , who was shoving food into his mouth at an appalling rate . " I have already eaten , and there is much to be done now that the Longago can proceed . " Her smile became sad . " Tonight I will return many old friends to the forest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say something else , reconsidered , and left through the leafleather curtain behind her . Logan continued thinking on this Longago that seemed of paramountimportance to these people . She bit into the gourd , found it had a taste like sugared persimmon . How did Born 's people dispose ofp92their dead , anyway , with no earth to bury them in ? Cremation , maybe , in the firepit at the village 's center . She said as much to Born . He mouthed contradictions through mouthfuls of food . " The earth ? Would you offer up the souls of your own friends to hell ? They will be returned to the world . " " Yes , Joyla mentioned that , " she replied impatiently , " but what exactlydoes that mean ? " But Born had returned to his food . She continued to prod him , arguingthat the rest between eating would do him good . Born still showed no inclination to talk , but the giant 's constant pestering compelledhim to satisfy her . " It is plain , " he finally mumbled , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they die . I can not describe the Longago to you . You will see it tonight . " Born had demonstrated a remarkable ability to recover from a totallydebilitating experience , Cohoma mused . He avoided a hump in the tuntangcle , hard to see by torchlight . The tribe was leading them through one turn after another in the black forest . Well , that was the kind of strength you could expect from people who lived in so harsh an environment as Born 's did . Only , such regression seemed impossible . He told Logan as much . " These people , " he said , with a nod at the marching column ahead and behind , " are n't that primitive . They 're the descendants of some long-lost colony ship . Physically , except for those prehensile toes , they 're as advanced as we are , but I do n't see how their proportions could change so much in a few centuries . " He stepped over a tiny dark flower growing in the tuntangcle . It held an explosive , poisonous spine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ten generations , they 've lost a sixth of their size , developed those toes , undergone tremendous expansionof the latissimus dorsi and the pectoral muscles , acquired uniformcoloration of skin , eyes , and hair . Evolution just does n't work that fast ! " Logan merely smiled softly , gestured ahead . " That 's fine , Jan . I agree . So , how do we explain this ? " " I refuse to believe it 's parallel development . The differences are too minor . " " How about rapid mutation , " Logan finally hypothesized , " induced by consumption of local chemicals in their foodstuffs ? " She eyed an exquisite grouping of globular chartreuse fruit surrounded by lavender blooms.  | " Possible , " Cohoma finally conceded . " But the scale , and the speed  --  " " Yes , that , " Logan interrupted , " coupled with the need to adapt rapidly or die , could force some extraordinary physiological accommodations . The body is capable of some remarkable changes when survival is at stake . Though I admit this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  she waved a hand leisurely at the forest  --  " if you 'd seen some of the reports coming out of Tsing-ahn 's or Celebes ' labs . . . " She shook her head wonderingly . " This planet is a googaplex of new forms , unusual molecular combinations , combination proteins . There are structures of local nucleic acids that defy conventional classification . And we 've only scratched the surface of this forest , barely probed at the upper levels . We 've no idea what the surface itself is like . But as we dig deeper , I 'm sure we 'll find  --  " Cohoma silenced her . " I think something 's going to happen . " They were approaching a brown wall , a monolithic trunk so vast as to belie its organic origin . Surely nothing so enormous could grow  --  it had to have been built . The party was beginning to fan out along one of the big emergent 's major branches , torches flashing umber off the meters-thick bark . " The trunk must be thirty meters thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wonder what it 's like at the base . " She raised her voice . " Born ! " The hunter turned from his place in the line of march and waited politely for them to catch up . " What do you call this one ? " She indicated the grandfather growth whose central bole was now behind them . " Its true name is lost to the ages , Kimilogan . We call them TheyWho-Keep , because they hold safe the souls of the people who die . " " Now I see , " she declared . " I was wondering how you disposed of your dead , since you never descend to the surface , to the First Level . And I did n't think you 'd hold to cremation . " Born looked confused . " Cremation ? " " Burning the bodies . " Any of Born 's older associates , Reader , for example , or Sand , would have been openly shocked at this thought . But Born 's mind did not work like those of his friends . He merely regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possibility . Is that how you dispose of those among you who change ? "  | " If by change , you mean die , " Cohoma responded , " yes , it is , some-times . " " How strange , " Born murmured , more to himself than to the giants . " We come of the world and believe we should return to it . I guess there are those among you who are not of the world and therefore have nothing to return to . " " Could n't have put it better myself , Born , " Cohoma admitted . They walked on in silence several minutes more , until the column began to spread out onto a slightly wider section of branch . " We 've come to the place ? " Logan asked softly . " One of the places , " Born corrected . " Each has his place . A proper one must be found for every man . " He looked upward , considered the black branches in the sky . " Come . You will see better from above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vines and lianas , they found themselves looking down on the wide sectionof branch below . Everyone was bunched tightly around a deep crack in the branch . It was several meters across and not many more long . The feeble light from the torches shielded against the rain made it impossible to tell how deep it went into the wood . The shaman was murmuring words too fast and soft for either Logan or Cohoma to interpret . The assembled people listened in respectfulsilence . One of the men who had died fighting the Akadi and a dead furcot were brought forward from the heavily laden litters . " They 're buried together , then , " Logan whispered . Born studied her sadly , a great pity welling up in him . Poor giants ! Sky-boats and other miraculous machines they might possess , but they were without the comfort of a furcot . Every man , every woman had a furcot who joined them soon after birth and went with them through life unto death . He could not imagine living without Ruumahum . " What happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cohoma asked . Born looked at him quizzically . " Ruumahum could not live without me , nor I without him , " he explained to the attentive giants . " When half of one dies , the other half can not long survive . " " I never heard of such a severe case of emotional interdependence between man and animal , " Logan muttered . " If we had n't observed any sign of it , I 'd probably suspect some kind of physical symbiosis had developed here as well . " Their attention was diverted from this new discovery by the actionsp95below . Sand and Reader were now pouring various smelly liquids over the two bodies , which had been lowered into the split in the branch . " Some kind of sacred oil , or something , " Cohoma ventured . But Logan hardly heard him . Emfol . . . mutual burial . . . half of oneself . . . Thoughts were spinning around and around in her head without forming any pattern , refusing to mesh , to reveal . . . what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could understand . But for a man to die of loneliness for his animal , probably Cohoma was right . Born 's people had been forced backward along the path of development by the sheer necessity to concentrate on surviving . This emotional entwining was a symptom of that sickness . One of the pounding thoughts swamping her brain suddenly demanded clarification . " You said men and women , " she whispered , staring downward . " Do furcots and people match up by sex ? " Born looked puzzled . " You know , female furcots to women , male to male ? Is Ruumahum a male ? " " I do not know , " Born replied absently , involved in the ceremony playing to its conclusion below . " I never asked . " As far as he was concerned , that was the end of the question . But it only stimulated Logan 's curiosity further . " And Losting 's furcot , Geeliwan . Is it a she ? " " I do not know . Sometimes we say he , ' sometimes . she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furcot is of the brethren of furcots . That is sufficient for them and for us . " " Born , how do you tell whether a furcot is male or female ? " " Who knows , who cares ? " This woman 's persistence was irritating him . " Has anyone ever seen furcots mating ? " " I have not . I can not vouch for what others may have seen . I have never heard it discussed , nor have I desire to discuss it . It is not meet , or seemly , somehow . " The thought suddenly went out of focus again . It was something to be pursued later . Her attention was directed downward once again . " What are they doing now , Born ? " Leaves , humus , dead twigs , and succulents were heaped on the bodies , filling the crevice . " The Keep must be sealed , of course , against predators . " " Naturally , " Cohoma agreed approvingly . " The oils and mulch speed biological degradation as well as masking the odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady chant rose from the assembly , oddly soaring and unlike a dirge . Reader made several passes with his hands over the tightly packed , filled crack , bowed once , then turned and walked toward the trunk , heading for another , slightly higher , branch . The rest of the tribe followed . They had many , many such interments to perform this night . The subsequent burials grew repetitious , and the drenched Cohoma and Logan used the opportunity to study the design of seemingly crude torches , which burned steadily despite the unceasing rain . Torches of slow-burning deadwood were cut and then treated with the ever-present incendiary pollen . The globular leaf of a certain plant was then punctured through , and the pulp inside cleaned out with a knife . This left a stiff-sided sphere about thirty centimeters in diameter . The sphere was then slid over the top of the torch and a small hole cut in the side . Contact with a finger through this hole served to ignite the powder and then the wood , while providing an exit for smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokeless . The tough fiber of the leaf was highly resistant to heat and flame . The procession wound through the damp darkness like a chanting , glowing snake spotted with flickering dots of yellow-green iridescence . Everyone who could walk , from small children to some older than Sand , joined in that twisting , spiraling column . None complained , none argued when the column turned upward , none wished for a rest or return . Something came out of the forest piercing the normal night-chitters and the lullaby of falling rain . Born came back to them . " Stay here with the column . Whatever happens , do not leave the light . " " Why not , what 's  --  ? " Logan began , but Born was already gone . The schwarzwald , the chlorophyllous sea swallowed him and the sixleggedbulk that shadowed him . They waited with the others in the rain . Then a great crashing and moaning sounded above the column and to the right , echoed by the sound of many voices . The moan rose in pitch , became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a succession of thunderous whoops . It ended with a gurgling , choking sound . Something massive and distant fell to their right with the sound of shattering branches and torn vines . The light from the torches penetrated the forest only faintly . Though given only the briefest glimpse of whatever had stumbledp97on the column in the dark , neither experienced explorer had any desire for a closer look at that monstrous outline . The crashing faded , dimmed , as the gigantic bulk vanished into the dark depths like a pebble down a dry well . There was no definite final crash . The breaking and tearing merely faded to a whisper , then a memory of a whisper , until the rain replaced it . Born returned to their side as the column started forward and up once more . " What was it ? " Cohoma asked softly . " We had only the faintest sight as it fell past . " He was startled to notice that his hands were shaking . " Another species new to us . " It made him feel better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow had fallen from the sky . " One of the big night-eaters , " Born informed him , his eyes never straying from the coal-black walls on all sides of them . " A diverdaunt . They will not come near the Home because of the pods , but a man or two who meet one in the forest will not come Home . It was crossing our line , and hungry . Otherwise it would never have attacked . They are very powerful , but slow  --  no match for a band of hunters and furcotsthis large . " This last was uttered with an unmistakable hint of satisfaction . " Could n't we have waited till it went past ? " Logan wondered . Born was shocked . " This is a burial march . Nothing can be allowed to interrupt a burial march . " " Not even a nest of Akadi ? " Cohoma murmured . Born looked at him sharply , eyes flashing in the torchlight . " Why say that ? " " I 'm evaluating your parameters , " the research scout explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that meant , and reminding him that there were things not even a great hunter could understand . Logan cursed silently at her partner 's lack of tact , hurriedly asked , " I was just wondering how all these creatures came by their names , if they were originally classified by your ancestors ? " Born smiled , back on familiar ground . " When one is young , one asks . An adult points and says , that is a diverdaunt , or that an ohkeefer , or that the fruit of the malpase flower which is not good to eat . " " According to the reports , those first colonists trapped here , " Cohoma muttered to Logan , " were in no mood to engage in standard scientific classification . So the names that stuck were colloquial rather than generic . "  |p98Born  heard this clearly ; he heard everything when the giants engaged in their odd , secretive soft-speak . But as usual , he gave no indication that he had heard . It would have been impolite . Though there were many times when he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column continued onward . Once a series of spits and squeals sounded from directly above . Another time something that thrummed like an unmuffled navigational computer approached from below and to their left . Hunters were sent to ferret out the sources of these threateningsounds , but found nothing . The people were not attacked again . Eventually the last who had fallen to the Akadi were returned to the world . The final words were chanted , the penultimate song sung . They returned to the Home . By what method or signs Born 's folk found their way through the forest neither Logan nor Cohoma could determine . And they were more relieved than they cared to admit when the first flowering vines with their multitude of pink blooms and leathery spore sacs came into view . It was only later , when the entire troop had re-entered the comfortingtrunklets of the Home , when the last slow-burning torches had been extinguished , when the last leafleather curtain had been drawn tight , only then did muffled sobs and the lonely sounds of weeping become audible , held in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , a moist black blanket , and brought the mindlessnessand comfort of sleep . So there was none to see the movement at the fringe of the trees , none to see the long shapes stir from apparent sleep to gather by the topmost curve of webbed branches . A lazy cuff to the side of the head brought a sleeping cub awake and squalling . Triple pupils blinked in the near-absolute darkness . Ruumahum stood before Suv . On Muf 's passing , this new cub had been assigned to his care . There was no twinge of regret , no lingering sadness at the death of the other . He was with his person , and that was the Law . " Old one , what have I done ? " Suv pleaded . " Nothing , as you will doubtless continue to do . " Ruumahum snorted and started to pad up toward the gathering place . The cub started to follow , stumbled over his middle legs , then got all six workingtogether and shuffled along behind . " Then what is it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn . "  |p99Suv  detected an unusual solemnity in his new old one 's voice and decided that this truly was a time for cubs to keep tongue close to palateuntil otherwise instructed . Already he was used to this new elder , though not knowing the Law as well , he still felt an ache for Toocibel , who had died in the great fight . When Ruumahum and Suv arrived , all were gathered . In a column of twos they filed out from the Home , moving through the hylaea with a stealth and silence that belied their bulk . Sensitive nocturnal carnivoreson the hunt detected the mass movement and slinked near , till they smelled or saw what was pacing purposefully through the treepaths . Then they froze motionless , or crept away , or tried to become one with the forestscape until the column had passed . Other meat-eaters in their lairs stirred at the noise of many feet moving and prepared to defend their territories and dens against whateverdared approach . A chance gust of nightwind rustled leaves and petals and brought the scent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or species , no matter how terrible , those who caught that pungent scent gave up their territories , their dens , and took themselves elsewhere . Occasionally a living cloud of luminescent flitters , all glowing crimson and green and azure , would float down between the branches and cubbles to hover curiously over the column . The furcots looked neither left nor right , nor up at the dancing motes performing their chromatic choreography . Now and then a flitter would dip close , brilliant wings flashing gemlike in the night , Colors would dance in triple cat-eyes . A certain tree was reached , monarchical in size , a veritable goliath among local growths . But it was not its bulk which made it significant to the furcots , who arranged themselves according to age around a broad series of interlocking lianas . Leehadoon , who was furcot to the person Sand , took the place in the center of the semicircle . He paused to meet eyes with each of the assembled brethren in turn . Then he threw back his head . From betweenmachete-sharp canines and upthrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part mewling , and part something undefinable in human terms . The rest of the group joined in without instruction  --  just as Suv and the other cubs were able to participate without knowinghow or why , or the meaning of what they howled in the dark . Most animals within range of that nerve-tingling caterwaul fled . But some crept near , curiosity overpowering fear , to stare and wonder animal thoughts at the rite that was at once old and new . It wasp100different this time , more complex than Ruumahum or Leehadoon or any could remember . It would be different the next time and the next , the chorus always building , growing toward some inexplicable , unimaginable end . It was two days before sufficient supplies could be readied for the second attempt to reach the giants ' station-Home . Two days to prepare for a death the Akadi had not achieved , most of Born 's fellows believed . He had proved himself thrice now in a span of time no longer than a child 's dream . This did not alter the belief among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Losting did , that there is a peculiar bravery that is part of insanity . Therefore they exhibited respect toward Born now  --  but not admiration . There is no recompense in admiring madness . Born felt only their indifference , without sensing the attitude that provoked it , since none would admit their belief in his madness to his face . This made him madder , but in a different sense . So he sharpened axe and knife till it seemed there would be little left of either , and he thought private angry thoughts . He had come back from the fight with the grazer . He had come back from the giants ' sky-boat demon . He had come back from the Akadi . And he would come back from the giants ' station and bring all the wonders they promised him ! Maybe , maybe then , at last , Brightly Go would see daring and courage and intelligence whereas everyone else saw only madness ; see that they were worth much more than bulk and strength . Of all the hunters , only Losting , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had Born not saved the lives of the others ? True , they admitted , but all the more reason not to carelessly throw them away . Losting , then , whom Born could go without seeing for the necessaryweeks or months of travel and be blissfully content , would accompany him . He was secretly glad of the aid the big hunter would provide , but publicly taunting . " You think I go to my death . Then why come with me ? " he sneered , knowing the reason full well . " Some say the forest protects the mad . If so , it surely will save you . And I am as mad as you , for is not love a kind of madness ? " " If so , then we are surely both mad , " Born agreed , tightening thep101clasp on his cloak . " And they have been right all along , and I am the maddest of the lot . " " Remember , Born , you 'll not convince me to stay . I 'll see you die or come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two waiting giants , who were talking with the chief . Both had consented to accept a present of water-repellent cloaks , though they still insisted unreasonably on wearing their own tattered clothing underneath . When Born argued the absurdity of retaining such fragments , they countered with their old argument of catching cold . That stopped Born , for who was to say what strange maladies might exist among the giants ? " They have learned much in the days they have lived among us , " he observed , " though each is still as clumsy as a child . At least now they ask before touching , look before stepping . " " What do you think of them , Born ? " Losting asked . " We must watch constantly to see that they do not kill themselves before we reach their station-Home . " " Not that , " Losting corrected . " I meant , do you like them as perThesky-boat had been equipped with a good Mark V ranger , new beacon tracker , tridee broadcast unit , and automatic beam-homingsons ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they claim is true , they can do us good . If not "  --  he made a noncommittal face  --  " it will be a tale to tell our grandchildren . " That simultaneously brought the picture of a certain young female to both minds . The conversation ended by mutual agreement . It would not do to begin a journey longer than any had ever made with fighting . There would be fighting enough in the world before they reached their goal . On that one thing , both were agreed . Many in the village had come to see them off with good wishes and gifts of food , though none would meet Born 's eyes . They had long since returned to the daily business of gathering food and caring for the Home . So they took their leave of the Home , the chief and one lone child watching them go . A fat ball of fur rocked near the child , the cub Suv . The sight reminded Born of another child , another cub , now returned to the world . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much scrap , broken and twisted by gravity and by the sky-demon . Logan took out the tiny black disk with the clear face and once more blessed whoever among their outfitters had seen fit to include the compass in their tiny boot survival packs . She hoped this planet possessednothing in the way of magnetic abnormalities . At least , they had not been told of any . But then , skimmers were supposed to be foolproof , too . Different variations on the same thought had occurred to Born . In that respect this journey was suicidal , for they had only the giants ' word on where they were going . The possibility that they did not have a good idea of where their station lay was something he preferred not to think on . It did his spirits no good . Besides , he reasoned , if they did not have a fairly accurate idea , surely they would not have forsaken the safety and comfort of the Home on the wild chance that they would stumble across the station by searching at random . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mysterious station , he did not know . Handling himself among new people was not a major concern at the moment . Many days had passed since they had left the Home . Though it now lay many rests behind them , the emotion uppermost in Born 's mind was neither homesickness nor apprehension of what might lie ahead . Rather , he felt a peculiar combination of tedium and tension  --  tedium arising from the day-to-day discovery that each new section of the world was identical to that which lay within throwing distance of the Home and tension from the inescapable feeling that tomorrow it might not be . After the first seven-day the giants kept to themselves as much as possible , save for an occasional question whenever they encountered a plant or forest dweller new to them . That left Born with no one to talk to but Losting . Not surprisingly , the expedition proceeded with a dearth of jovial patter . The hunters continued to regard each other with a mixture of hatred and respect . These cancelled each other out and kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that this was neither the time nor the place for a violent settlement of their differences . Mutual slaughter would have to wait until their glorious return . As Born had predicted , the specially designed jungle-resistant fabric of the giants ' clothing began to rot away under the steady assault of ap103forest which had failed to read the manufacturer 's label . Cohoma and Logan were more grateful each day for the green cloaks they had been given . A good cloak offered its wearer concealment from enemies and protection from the night-rain , served as bedding , and had a dozen and one other uses . The giants grew more assured , more confident of their surroundings , as each new day came and went without incident . Considering their still incredible awkwardness in negotiating the treepaths , Born felt the little knot of humans had been exceptionally fortunate so far . The only serious encounter they had had could hardly have been predicted . It nearly cost them Logan . " I 'll be damned , " she had remarked to her companion , pointing up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear sky over there , or am I hallucinating ? " Born and Losting were moving just ahead of them , and neither hunter was paying much attention to the giants ' conversation . Cohoma looked in the indicated direction . He saw what certainly looked like an oval section of blue sky streaked with fluffy white clouds . " Not unless we 're both seeing things . Must be another hole in the forest , like the one our boat made coming down . " They angled toward it . At that moment Losting turned to make sure their charges were safe behind them . " Stop  --  this way ! " Born was slightly ahead of Losting . At the other 's shout , he turned and immediately saw the cause of the hunter 's concern . " It 's all right , " Logan answered confidently . " I know about the skydemonsfrom first-hand experience . " She shook her head , smiled . " We 're too far down in the forest , and this hole 's too narrow to let even the smallest flier descend . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the broad cubble toward the ellipse of clear blue . Losting yelled again and hurriedly tried to explain , even as bothgiants continued walking . Knowing the ineffectiveness of trying to argue with Cohoma and Logan , Born was already running toward them . As he jumped from branch to cubble , his snuffler clattering and banging against his back , he was fighting to untangle his axe from its belt loop . The two blind giants were almost to it now . He could see the slight rippling around the edges of the blue . The axe would be too late . Fortunately , others had also detected the danger . Ruumahum and Geeliwan were there . Powerful jaws closed gently but firmly on tough cloak material . Another function of the multipurpose cape wasp104abruptly demonstrated as the two furcots yanked backward in unison . Logan yelped . Cohoma 's exclamation was more detailed . Born had the axe out and ready just in case , as the two giants were dragged clear of the blue patch . The fluttering around the fringe of that broad blue circle matched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank the Home ! An axe would not have been much good against a clouder , and he would have hated to depend on Losting'sspeed with a snuffler . Either way , the clouder would certainly have killed one if not both of the giants before the jacari poison could take effect . Losting came up alongside him . The big hunter had his own axe out . Together they examined the oval section of sky and clouds , ignoringthe two giants who were now struggling angrily to their feet . Ruumahum and Geeliwan had let loose their cloaks , but rested close by , watching . Born nodded to Ruumahum , once . The old furcot snorted and disappeared with Geeliwan into the brush . The hunter studied Logan as she fought to remove her tangled cloak from between her legs . Her face was flushed . " What 's the harm in letting us have a look at the sky again , Born ? Still afraid of sky-demons ? Maybe it does n't mean much to you , but we 've had nothing over our heads but green for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  even if it 's a bit green-tinged  --  is a visual treat for us . To panic like this just because  --  " " I would risk leaving you a look at your Upper Hell were we high enough for it , " Born replied calmly . " Well , this 'll do since we 're not . What 's wrong with it ? It 's just another well in your world , a natural one , unlike the one we made when our skimmer fell . " Born shook his head . One must force oneself to be patient with these giants , he reminded himself . They could not emfol . " You see no sky and no clouds . That which you see is a clouder resting in killing mode . It was about to make a meal of both of you . " If the situation had not been so deadly serious , Born might have found Logan 's expression amusing . She turned a confused gaze on the circle of " sky , " examined the clouds drifting within it . She eyed Cohoma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't understand . Is there some kind of animal that sits around such openings and waits for something to enter the open space ? I do n't see anything like that . " " There is no open space , " Born elaborated carefully . " Watch . " They withdrew to a position behind some thick succulents andp105waited . Ten , twenty minutes of silence , at the end of which both giants were growing nervous and fidgety . At about the twenty-fifth minute a small brya  --  a four-footed , four-clawed herbivore about the size of a pig  --  wandered toward the patch of blue while rooting in the dense growth beneath it for edible aerial tubers . Again Born detected the fluttering around the fringe of the sky , but did n't point it out to Cohoma and Logan . He did n't have to  --  they saw it for themselves . The brya wandered into the space beneath the sky . When it was in the exact center , the sky fell , clouds and all . The quivering clouder resembled a thick mattress lined on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brya , which squealed only once . The clouder moved jerkily for a minute or two , then relaxed . Five minutes later the fringe of tentacles or cilia extended . The clouder climbed back up to its nesting place , stripping the surrounding vegetation in the process to keep plenty of clear space beneath it . It settled into place once more , four meters above the nearest growth . It was pebbled and green on top . Its underside was shaded so much like a section of sky speckled with clouds that Logan had to blink to make sure it had really moved . A few bones , too tough for even the clouder 's supremely efficient digestive juices , were carefully thrown clear once excreted . " Camouflage , yes . Protective mimicry , yes , " Logan whispered . " But a carnivore that imitates the sky  --  " Cohoma was equally awed , especially when he considered he might easily have gone the way of the brya had not the furcots intervened . Born sighed and turned to lead on . " I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky and a clouder is a clouder . Walk under the last and soon see nothing . " He started back down the cubble . A suitably chastized Logan and Cohoma followed , looking uneasily to their right as they passed the innocent-seeming circle of blue and white . " Just when you think you 've got this ecosystem figured , " Cohoma mumbled , " got the predators and the prey identified and cataloged , something like that nearly snaps your head off . Carnivores that imitate the sky ! Next thing you know , Born 'll be warning us about something that imitates nothing ! " Three days later they encountered the palinglass and again barely escaped being consumed . Weeks had passed . Many nights later they secured an especially good camp in the hollow of a Pillar branch . The wood-walled cavep106was more than large enough to accommodate all six of them comfortably , if it was unoccupied . Born and Losting motioned for the two giants to stay behind when they first saw the orifice . They then approached the cavernous scar cautiously , loaded snufflers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , solid shelter , so spacious , would be devoid of life . Such was the case , however . Neither Ruumahum or Geeliwan had detected any scent . When the hunters entered the hollow , they found only very old droppings , and more deadwood than they could use in a hundred fires . That night a lavish blaze illumined the interior of the branch , reflecting off dark nodules and twisted stalactites of cracked wood and bark . Born studied the giants . Under the soothing effect of the fire and the excellent shelter , he felt more inclined to talk than he had for many days . " I have almost come to believe that you truly come from a world other than this , Kimilogan . " Cohoma 's expression did n't change , but Logan appeared pleased . " That 's a big step , Born , and an important one . I 'm not surprised , though , that you made it . You 're obviously the most perceptive of your people , and the most receptive to change , to new ideas . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coals nearest her with a twisted stick , listened to the ever-steady trickle of night-water outside . " You know , Born , when you and your people and the other tribes here rejoin the family of man they 're going to need someone to speak for them with our company . " She glanced up at him evenly . " I ca n't think of a better candidate than yourself . With what you 've already done for the company in rescuing Jan and myself , I do n't see how you can help but be chosen . Such a position would be very advantageous for you . " Losting listened to this and said nothing . His respect for Born 's cleverness was as great as his dislike for his person . He snuggled back against Geeliwan and listened to what Born , not the giants , had to say . " The world you say you come from does not sound very inviting , " Born replied , and then held up a quieting hand as Cohoma seemed ready to object , " but that is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way toward this world . That is of no matter . " He paused thoughtfully , leaned forward to lend emphasis to his next words . " What I wish to know is  --  if you are so satisfied with your own world and the others you say exist , why come with much trouble andp107difficulty to this one ? " Suddenly , his face shadowed by the firelight , the hunter did not look quite so primitive . Cohoma and Logan exchanged glances . " Two reasons , Born , " she finally replied . " One is simple to understand ; the other . . . well , I think you will , in time . I do n't know if chief Sand or Reader the shaman would . " She toyed with the stick , flicked a glowing coal outwardinto the rain-drenched edge of the cave . It hissed as the tepid drops struck it . " It has to do with the acquisition of something called money , which in turn has to do with commerce . All will be made clear to you at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you 'll see why I 'm reluctant to go into details just yet . All I will say is that you  --  and your people  --  will benefit considerably , just as Jan and I and our friends will . " The other thing is lesser for some men , more important for others  --  curiosity . The same thing that drove you to descend to find out what our skimmer really was . The same thing that 's driving you , against your better judgment , against the advice of all your friends , to try and return us safely to our station . It 's the same thing that 's carried mankind and the thranx from star to star  --  curiosity , and the other thing . " " What are thranx ? " Born asked . " Some folk I think you 'd like , Born . " She stared out at the darkness . " And who 'd like this world very much , more so than my people . " " Are there any of these thranx at your station ? " Losting suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our "  --  she hesitated  --  " company , or group , organization , tribe , if you will . " She smiled brightly . " Everything will become much clearer when we reach the station . " " I 'm certain it will , " Born mused agreeably , staring into the dancing flames . Later , as he rolled himself up in his cloak and over into the softly snoring bulk of Ruumahum , he wondered if he would . He also wondered if he wanted to.  |p108No  one knows how silently a big animal can move until an adult furcot has unexpectedly padded up close to him . Ruumahum moved that way when the odor woke him , rising so muffled-ear quiet even Born , lightest of sleepers , failed to awake . The aroma came from outside and above , so heavy with its distinctive musk it penetrated down through two levels and the still falling rain . Geeliwan stirred in sleep as Ruumahum padded to the front of the cavern . He stuck his head outside , stared upward with triple piercing eyes , which blinked frequentlyagainst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no harm in making sure . He gripped the wood with forelegs , followed with the middle pair and then the hind , and swung out onto the side of the trunk . Closebunchedleg muscles worked in unison as he clawed his way up the trunk . It was harder than finding a spiraling path in the thick vegetation , but time was important if his suspicion was correct . The hair behind his ears bristled as the threatening miasma grew stronger and stronger . Few sensory impressions can raise the hackles of a furcot . Ruumahum was absorbing one of them now . The long vertical climb was tiring , even for him . Then he saw it , still far above , but moving steadily downward , and he knew why their excellentshelter had been empty : This was a silverslith 's tree . It had their scent , that was certain . They were already dead , unless the persons could devise a new thing . Turning , he rushed back down through branches and vines , eating up the meters with prodigious plunges and leaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby , which was the idea . Perhaps one would be foolish enough to investigate . The temporary snack might divert the silverslith for a few precious minutes . They had little time . The silverslith was moving slowly , deliberately , playing with its intended prey . And the giants would slow them further . He burst into the cave noisily enough to wake Born and Losting instantly . Geeliwan gave a warning growl , relaxed at the familiar smell . Ruumahum stood panting before them , wet fur glistening in thep109glow from the coals . " Wake others , " he puffed . While Losting moved to rouse the giants , Ruumahum whispered something in the talk of furcots , which prompted Geeliwan to hurry to the cave entrance . He stationed himself there , staring upward . " What 's going on ? What is it now ? " Cohoma grumbled sleepily as Losting shook him . Logan had already moved to a sitting position and waited to be told . " We must leave here immediately , " Born told them . He fastened his cloak more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . Losting was doing likewise . " This is a silverslith 's tree . It explains why we did not have to fight for this shelter . It is shunned , as we should have shunned it . There was no reason to suspect , none . I feel no better for it , though . " " All right , " Logan asked tiredly , " another pesty beast . What 's a silverslith , Born , and what can we do about it ? " " Leave , " he replied tightly , using a thick fragment of wood to push the glowing embers from the fire toward the cave mouth . The rain would put them safely out . " In the middle of the night ? " " The silverslith dictates this , not I , Kimilogan . We can only run and weave , weave and run . There is a chance it will tire and leave us . " " Something that will follow us , like the Akadi ? " Cohoma wondered . The seriousness of the situation had finally penetrated his sleepnumbedbrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the silverslith , the mind of the Akadi is as changeable as . . . as "  --  he fumbled for a suitable analogy  --  " the desires of a woman . Once having the scent of one who has invaded its tree , the silverslith will follow till the invader is eaten . Nor can it be outrun like the Akadi . And unlike the Akadi , it does not sleep . " " Now that 's got to be legend , " Cohoma insisted , fumbling with his cloak . " There 's no such thing as a warm-blooded creature that does n't sleep , and only a few cold-blooded ones can go without rest . " " I do not know the temperature of its blood , " Born commented , moving toward the cave mouth , " nor even if it has blood . No one has ever seen a silverslith bleed . I will not banter with you now . " Oddly enough , he grinned . " When you are tired from running , I suggest you stop for a nap and see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe you , " Logan confessed , trying to arrange her clothes . " We 've got to , after what we 've seen . A creature whose livingp110cycle runs in weeks instead of days . So many weeks of wakefulness , so many weeks of sleep . " " The silverslith does not sleep , " Born reiterated forcefully . Decidingit was useless to argue with those who refused to accept the truth , he finally made a curt gesture to them to follow . Losting had prepared torches , bundles of torches . But they still had to locate the globular leaves that would shield the flame from the rain , and there was no time to look . They had to get away from the tree . Hopefully they would encounter some of the fairly common growths along the way . Until then they would be forced to make their way in darkness . " Quickly , " Ruumahum growled with furcot impatience . " It senses us . " Geeliwan ! " Losting whispered . The furcot moved to the nearest liana , jumped from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another and another . Then it looked back up , eyes gleaming in the night . They would be the only beacons they had in the forest . Losting went next , followed by Cohoma . Logan looked back up at Born as she was about to move to the liana . " I thought it was too dangerous to travel at night ? " " It is , " he admitted , " but it is death to stay here . " She nodded . " Just wanted to make sure this was n't some kind of test , " she replied cryptically , turning and moving from liana to branch . Born hesitated long enough to murmur to Ruumahum as the furcot stared upward into the rain . " How much time ? " " It will search every niche of cave . Then follow . " " Any chance we could fight it , old friend ? " Ruumahum snorted . " Born dreams . Fight silverslith ? Not even silverslith-young . " His gaze went upward again . " Not young . Old one , big . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had another new thought . It was a frightening thought , but nothing else offered itself in substitution , and there was no time for detailed speculation . They could probably stay ahead of the silverslith . But they could not run away and leave it , nor could they shake it from their trail , or fight it . Eventually fatigue would slow them , stop them , and the untiring killer would finish them at its leisure . Still reluctant to propose the thought , he moved rapidly with the others away from the tree . They had been traveling for some time when faint thunder boomed across the forest from somewhere behind them . It was caused by the abrupt displacement of air , but its source was not electrical in nature.  | " It has discovered our absence , " Born explained to Logan , in response to the unvoiced question . " It will spend a few minutes voicingits rage and then come after . " " Tell me , Born , " she asked , struggling to stay behind the vague shape of Losting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silverslithnever gives up till its quarry is killed , how do you know so much about its habits , and what it looks like ? You do know what it looks like ? " The giant was wasting too much energy on talk . Ever polite , he responded , " There are tales of a party of twenty or thirty being attackedby one . They scattered in as many directions . Not even a silverslithcould follow every scent to its source before some had faded . A few survived to tell of the monster . " " You 're saying not even twenty or thirty of you . . . " " And as many furcots. " " ... and their furcots could fight one of these things ? " " Too big , too strong , " Born told her . " I thought your jacari poison would kill anything . " " Silverslith skin is too thick , " he explained . " Also , jacari poison works on . . . on "  --  he searched his memory for the ancient term  --  " the nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silverslith ? " Cohoma asked . " It 's got to have some vulnerable points . " " When it comes , you show me , " Born muttered . " Anyway , silverslithhas no nervous sytem , the tale says . " Logan 's willingness to credit the creature with the ability to go long periods without rest or sleep did not extend this far . " Oh , come on , Born , " she said with the confidence of superior knowledge , " every animal has a nervous system . " " Has it ? " " An animal could n't live without a nervous system , Born . " " Could n't it ? " " At the very least , " she added , " it must have some kind of rudimentarybrain and central locomotor system . " " Must it ? " She gave up . Cohoma had n't paid much attention . He was still musingon the fact that this thing pursuing them could put thirty furcots to flight . " Look , how much of this is true and how much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party ? Naturally they'dp112want to make out the invulnerability of anything that forced them torun . Born was about to reply , but Ruumahum interrupted him . It was unusual for a furcot to break into a conversation between persons . Ruumahum did so to keep Born 's adrenalin level low until more energy was needed later . " Silverslith tree , " he growled softly , " only thing in world Akadi change march-path for . Big persons shut up now and watch own path . " That information was enough to cause Logan and Cohoma to overlook the fact that they had been given an order by an overgrown pet . They pondered it as they hurried on in silence . Meanwhile Born continued to turn his earlier thought over and over in his head . He tried to argue his way out of it ; it held him tight as a grazer 's arm . He tried to avoid it ; it stood firmly in the way of his thoughts like the silverslith 's Pillar-tree . Temporarily he managed to forget it by cursing himself for failing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry , inviting shelter , so empty , so shunned . Fool ! " Fool 's fool ! " he muttered aloud . " And I with you , " Losting muttered nearby , but Born hardly heard him . " Do n't berate yourself , Born . You said there was no way of telling what it was , " Logan told him . " No . If it had been lower , Ruumahum would have scented it . But it was far , far up the trunk , near the very top probably , hell-hunting . " " Hell-hunting ? " " Fishing the night sky for air-demons , " he explained . " Reaching up to pull down fliers at the treetops , like the one that attacked your skimmer when it fell . " " Oh , " she murmured . Another sobering thought . " It did not sense us till it started downward . That 's when Ruumahum smelled it . " They finally found the globular leaves growing to one side of their treepath . Geeliwan saw them , moved with Ruumahum to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though if the silverslithattacked , they could give the humans only a couple of extra minutes . A little of the fire pollen and they had real light again . It cheered Cohoma and Logan . At least they could see where they were stepping now . At the same time , Logan expressed a new worry to Born . " Wo n't these make us easier to see for any other local predators ? "  | " It does not matter now . The silverslith is too close . No other creature of the night will come near , having scented it . They will run , too . Have you not noticed the silence ? " Logan listened and knew what Born meant . The usual night sounds , the normal whistles and clicks , beepings and hums interspersed with an occasional deep-throated roar , were missing . Only the constant drip , drip of the rain remained , punctuated by a wandering wisp of lost wind . They hurried on in eerie silence . " It nears , " Ruumahum soon rasped . " Slowly , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , Born , " Logan said at the same time , gasping , fighting for breath . " I ca n't keep this up . I do n't know which 'll go first , my eyes or my legs . " " Then , " Born said , sighing heavily , making the decision he had been putting off for hours , " it is better to start now . " " Start where ? " The query came from Losting . " Down . . . to the other levels . " Neither Losting nor the giants cared if the monstrous apparition now close on their trail heard their shouts and yells . " What 's the good of descending to another level ? " " We 'll only lose the daylight when it comes . " " The silverslith will follow us easily , " Losting added . " Follow us forever . You know that , Born . " Born looked at his ally and rival . " Even to Hell ? " That was the first and last time either Cohoma or Logan ever heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too stunned to reply as Born continued . " I will not stay to argue with you , Losting , or with any of you . I am going down to the Seventh Level , if the silverslith still follows . Down to whatever is there . " " Death is there , " Geeliwan sighed . " Death to wait here , sleek friend , " Born reminded . He looked ahead to Losting again . " We know what the silverslith will do when it catches us . At the very least , we may find a new way to die . " " Born , you said yourself that to go to the Lower Hell , the surface , was certain death , " Logan said softly . " Less certain than to stay here . Maybe the silverslith will not follow , for it lives here near the top of the world . It may live equally well among its relations at its bottom , but we do not know that . I think it is a chance , at least . I will not try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do what he thought best , assuming the others would see the wisdom of his ways and follow him . That was what he had always done . It worked now as he began the slow descent to depths unseen , plunging into ever blacker , more ominous darkness . They followed , all of them , but not out of respect for his greater wisdom , as he thought . They followed because in a crisis , uncertain people will follow whatever leader declares himself . In that respect Losting proved himself as human as Logan or Cohoma . Cubbles and lianas came and went . Downward-sloping tree branches , parasitic growths the size of sequoias and greater passed and were left behind . One such tree sprouted a thousand thick air-roots all entwined . They used them to drop with greater speed for many meters . They left the Fifth Level behind and entered the Sixth , moving into a region of brown and white and purple growths that started crowding out the green . Then they were through the center of the Sixth , then through its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world feebly lit by torchlight that seemed to huddle close to its parent wood in fear . A world of Pillar-tree bases with boles as big around as starships . Buttresses , multibladedand massive , rose on all sides . There were glowing fungi the size of storerooms , which thrived and grew in a riotous profusion of obscene , grotesque shapes . Small glowing things crawled in and among them and hid from their torchlight . Here there was no morning and no evening , no day and no night  --  only a perpetual darkness that belonged neither to the sun or the moon . Even though the phophorescent fungi and their twisted relativesgave enough light to see by , the torches were kept lit . It was a cleaner , purer radiance than what shone here . Yellow and red and white light issued from around them , a ghostly , ethereal evanescence , which suggested outlines rather than whole forms , hinted rather than described . At last they came to a stop at the base of one ridge-backed buttress , the final stairway to the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would never know the internal logic  --  magic of photosynthesis . They had surely reached the ground , the Seventh Level , Lower Hell itself . Yet , there seemed even here to be another level below , for nearby the ground turned soft , sticky and wet , thicker than water , thinner than mud . Logan turned , breathing painfully , and stared back up the way they had come . The buttress behind her was like a dark brown-black cliff.  |p115Above  it she could detect only darkness and the faint glow of distant fungi . There was nothing to indicate that a couple of hundred meters above them was a world of light and green life that pulsed and rustled with wind and rain . It was humid here to the point of suffocation , though only an occasionalpersistent droplet from the still falling night-rain penetrated this far . The rest had been absorbed or caught high above by a thousand million bromeliads or other water-holding plants . The rare drop was a reminder that they had not died , that a living green world still existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward along the face of the wood , solid as granite . " Ruumahum ? " " It comes still , " the furcot muttered after testing the air . " But slower , much slower , even cautiously . " " We have no time for caution . " He turned to Logan and Cohoma , indicated the swampy morass which spread around their tiny , dry peninsula . " I know nothing of footing like this . Yet we must leave this spot before the silverslith 's fury overcomes its care . " Long moments , precious moments , came and went while all four humans considered the problem . Logan found herself running a hand up and down the trunk of one of the orange trunks that flared from where the buttress of the great tree entered the water . More than anything else they resembled bright red-orange reeds , though they surely were no member of the reed family . She took out her bone knife and tried the material . It cut , but not easily . The fiber was dense , not pulpy or water-filled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can locate something that would serve as cord . Some kind of vine or something . I think these will make a decent raft  --  a machine for traveling on the water  --  if we stack them crossways two deep . " They worked so fast it was a wonder no one lost an arm or leg in the building . As each orange bole was felled , it exuded a thick odor redolentof stale onion . Construction proceeded apace when Born and Ruumahum returned with loops and loops of some sticky , gray waterplantcoiled around themselves . Logan and Cohoma laid and held the " logs " and instructed Born and Losting on how and where to set the ties . All the while , Ruumahum and Geeliwan kept watch on a ridge above . Their periodic guttural warnings , shouted down from high up on the buttress , indicated that the silverslith was still moving and with that same unnatu/ral slowness . It did not occur to anyone to wonder at the monster 's caution . It did , however , occur to Logan suddenly to ask , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever , of these , did we ? Is n't that against your religion , or moral stance , or something ? " She indicated the felled logs . " They are not of the forest , of my world . " He looked disgusted . " They are a kind of life I feel only distantly akin to . I can not emfol with them . There is nothing to emfol with . " " It 's finished , " Cohoma announced loudly , forcing Logan to stifle further questions . Fascinating as this still unresolved thing called emfolingwas , survival was more important . A shout drifted down to them . " Quickly , Born ! " Ruumahum again . " It sees us . It comes fast now . " Seconds later , it seemed , both furcots had rejoined them at the base of the buttress . The hair was erect on their necks , and they glanced continually upward . Logan stared up also , as did Cohoma , but as yet there was nothing to be seen . Their meager equipment thrown aboard , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space problem . The raft was big enough to hold twice as many men and furcots . Cohoma , Born , Logan , and Losting all shoved , lifted and shoved . The raft refused to budge . " Ruumahum , Geeliwan , " Cohoma directed , " move to the far end of the raft a little ! " The furcots did so , and this time when the humans shoved , the raft slid cleanly into the brown sludge . The first thing Cohoma did was test the depth of the muck . The split section of tapering reed disappeared until his fist was immersed . They would not be wading through this . The thick liquid made for slow paddling , but by the same token , it also helped support the makeshift raft . Everyone pushed furiously , their progress hampered initially by Losting and Born 's ignorance of paddle mechanics . But they learned quickly . With increasing speed they made their way out a considerable distance from the shore . Above them the black sky arched high overhead . It was like rowing silently through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little patches of dry earth and on the trunks of dead or living trees was dense , but there was no furious desire to reach for open space here , since there was no need to compete for the sun . " Where 's the tree we came down ? " Logan asked . She squinted back the way she thought they had come . Everything beyond a certain dis/tance looked the same , since the light from the glowing fungi did not reach very far . Then she saw the thing and knew which bole it was they had come down , and what a silverslith was , and she screamed . It stopped when it reached the base of the buttress  --  at least the front part of it stopped there . The rest of it extended back up the tree , up and up into the blackness beyond for an unknown distance . Its body was a fifth as big around as the Pillar-tree itself . It looked like an animated forest , its cylindrical body bristling with thousands of independentlywrithing cilia the color of polished antimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was a bloated horror , a creationof an aberrant nature . Numerous pulsating mouths dotted the globular head , gray teeth sprouting like helicites in every direction . Tentacles grew around the mouths seemingly at random , and the whole nauseating visage was liberally pockmarked with featureless black blots that may have been eyes . It uttered low mewling sounds , incongruously soft . These rose and shifted to a high , piping titter that sent icy chills through Cohoma and Logan . The head alone stretched out many meters over the water . It swung slowly from side to side as if it were smelling the surface . Then the head lifted . Though those black orbs went in all directions , it felt to Cohoma as if it were staring directly at them . " Oh , my god , my god , " Logan croaked . " It 's seen us . " " Not like this . . . not this way , " Cohoma was moaning . " Be quiet and  --  what do you call it  --  paddle ! " Born growled through clenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fresh sweat dripped from his forehead . They had gained real distance on the raft and were well out on the water . But the silverslith had pursued them into Hell itself . Born sensed that it was not about to be deprived of its prey . It reached out for them , mewling loudly . More of that seemingly endless body flowed in humping motions down the Pillar trunk and along the buttress , and still the tail was not visible . It was not yet trying to swim . Instead it was stretching to the left , reaching for the buttress of the next major growth . Born saw with despair that by moving in this fashion , it would soon be able to pluck them from the false safety of the raft without ever having to touch water . Losting saw it too , and together the hunters began a frantic search for a crevice , a crack in the base of one of the enormous boles where they might hide , though such was the strengthp118of the silverslith that it would rip even those huge boles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded behind them , like a child stepping into a vat of grazer lard . Then the water erupted , vomiting forth a colossal , soulless shape so vast it could not be believed . The thing occupiedthe whole broad basin of open water they had just crossed . The behemoth ignored them just as Born would ignore a leaf falling on his head in the forest . They were not worth bothering with . Long multijointed legs with claws the size of small trees shot out and hooked around the stretching form of the silverslith . A single eye bigger than the giants ' skimmer flashed for a merciful instant between those taloned legs . What they could see of its body , where it emerged from the water , was a mad hybrid of the sacred and the profane . For it was encrusted with jewels  --  emeralds and sapphires , topaz and tormaline , set in weaving patterns and with natural luminescence . It was overpoweringlybeautiful , awesome , terrifying . Everyone fell and held on tightly to the orange logs and gray lashings as the raft began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titanic battle . Born knew nothing of swimming and tried to conceiveof breathing water . He decided he would rather be eaten . Hours later , it seemed , the rocking finally subsided . When Born was able to raise his head , the first thing he saw was Ruumahum and Geeliwan standing side by side at the rear of the raft . The furcots were staring at the water behind them . Born struggled to his knees . There was nothing behind them now but silence  --  silence and the far-off shiningshapes of distorted fungi and lichens lit by their own cold , internal light . And distantly , a soft bubbling sound , which a child might have made by blowing into water . Of the silverslith and the hell-born that had come to meet it , there was no sign . Logan sat up , emotionally and physically exhausted . She wiped the hair out of her eyes and tried to get her heartbeat under control , with little success . Born watched her for a moment , found his paddle where he had shoved it between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jancohoma ? " he asked . There was no reply . " Jancohoma , which way ? " he repeated , more loudly . Cohoma pulled out the compass , found his hand was shaking too badly to take a reading . He grabbed his right wrist with his left hand and stared at the luminous face . " Better . . . better turn us a little to the right here , Born . A little more . . . more . . . Losting , do n't you paddle yet . There , now paddle together . "  |p119They  forced themselves not to think of what they might be paddling over , of what a touch of the paddle might stir to wakefulness . They were almost too tired to care . Logan leaned back , lay down on the smelly logs and stared up at a tiny universe formed by glowing mushroomlike things growing upside down from the bottom of a major branch high above . " You would n't think hell could be so beautiful . " Her expression twisted , and she suddenlylooked over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head between his arms , and he was shaking . " Jan , if we meet another raft , let 's ask its pilot directions , even if he 's got a three-headed dog with him . " " I do n't like dogs , " Cohoma replied flatly . From his tone , one might almost believe he took the suggestion seriously . There was no sunrise to bring peace to the tiny knot of humans and furcots who rode the orange speck between wooden towers , beneath a black sky speckled with pseudostars . On what should have been the morning of the following day , they were attacked twice in the space of fifteen minutes . They saw nothing till they were set upon . Fortunately , neither of the creatures was bigger than a man . They encountered nothing which approached the size of the armored colossus which had attacked the silverslith . The first assault came from the air , in the form of a four-winged flier equipped with a long mouth full of needlelike teeth . It dove silently at them from between the soaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to sound a warning . Its first dive missed completely and it hooked around , wheezing like an old man . Both hunters were readying their snufflers for the second swoop . They never had a chance to use them . Rearing up on hind legs , Ruumahum brought powerful forepaws together . They closed on one wing , and the flier screeched , crumpling to the raft . The long jaws snapped frantically till Geeliwan shattered its skull with a single swipe of a clawed paw . No sooner had the carcass been disposed of than something that resembled a pineapple with sixteen long thin legs tried to crawl onto the deck . Axes rose and fell on articulated limbs until the crippled carnivoreslipped back into the slime . " Internal lights can attract others of the same species for purposes of mating , " Logan mused , " as with certain deep-sea fish on Terra and Repler . They can also draw predators . Born , Losting , put out your torches . "  |p120The  hunters looked doubtful . A man caught at night in the hylaea without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logan and Cohoma managed to persuade them to try it . Reluctantly they removed the protectiveglobes and dipped the torches in the water , but not before two fresh ones were readied just in case . They were not used . With the torches out , their eyes adjusted to the lesser light emanating from the glowing life around them . There was still enough to make out their course between the tree boles which supported the world above . And they were not attacked again . They had been traveling on the raft for several hours when Born discovered he was thirsty . He dropped to his knees and bent his head to the murky water . " Wait , Born ! " Logan yelled . " It might not  --  " She need not have bothered . Born 's nose wrinkled as the noxious smell struck him . He had no advanced degrees , no knowledge of biochemistryto draw on . His nose was sufficient to tell him that the substancethey were gliding on was not fit to drink . He told the others as much . " Hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward . " The bacterial count in this swamp must be nothing short of astronomical . When you consider how many tons . . . tons of already decomposing animal and vegetable matter fall on every square kilometerof the surface every day . . . Then figure the stifling heat down here . " He mopped his forehead . " And the daily rainfall . You can figure this world is built on a sea of liquefied peat and compost the Church only knows how deep ! " " Obviously these trees , despite their enormous requirements , ca n't handle all the rainfall , " Logan ventured thoughtfully . She leaned back on the drifting raft and stared at the bole of the growth passing on their right . It was not quite as big around as an interstellar cargo carrier . " I 'd like to know how some of these half-kilometer-high emergentsdraw water from the surface and pump it to that height . . . . " " I 'd hate like hell to paddle this thing past the station before we climb again , " Cohoma suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've no way of estimating our daily progress . " " Born and Losting know how to judge distance . " Cohoma smiled . " Sure , through the treepaths . Not on this . " He indicatedthe raft , then turned to face Born . " What do you think ? " he asked the hunter . " Do n't we stand a better chance in the canopy thanp121down here , as long as we do n't choose the wrong hidey-hole the next time we feel like a nap ! " " I have been watching for a good way up ever since we left the dwelling place of the surface demon , " he replied . " We must begin our return to the world soon anyway . See ? " He pointed ahead and downwardwhile Losting paddled on grimly , scanning the mammoth roots and buttresses for one the giants could climb . As Cohoma and Logan stared , Born dug down into the orange log with his heel . A shallow groove appeared . Then he drew his leg up and brought his heel down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ankle in the orange punk . When he tugged it free , a **25;2295;TOOLONG oozed from the break . The hole did not fill in . " What was it you said about bacterial action and decomposition here , Jan ? " Logan muttered sardonically . She turned to survey the slowly passing , glowing dreamscape . " Born 's right ; if we do n't find a place to land soon , this raft 's going to dissolve right under us . " The murky , thick soup of the surface was lapping their ankles when Losting finally located a possible stairway leading them upward . A wooden peninsula was formed by the twisting bulk of a great root , which extended horizontally into the water before disappearing . Insteadof shooting a hundred meters skyward in precipitous vertical assault , the root curved gently into the central trunk . Some hard paddling grounded the shaky craft on the hardwood beach . None too soon , for instead of resisting or splintering , the front fifth of the raft collapsed on contact . A quick study showed that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further . Nearly all the logs were rotted at least half through . More damaging was the fact that most of the gray lashings Born had found were completelygone . Had they remained on the raft much longer , they would have come to an abrupt , not gradual , end , as the lashings gave out and the logs came apart beneath them . Once up the easy ramp provided by the great curved root , there were knobs and protrusions which would make climbing manageable . Even so , going up was going to be quite a different proposition from their rapid descent . Cohoma voiced Logan 's sentiments as well as his own . " We 're going to climb that ? " " All men can fly , " Born mused , " but sadly , only in one direction  --  down . I 'm afraid we must . Losting and I will go first and search out the easiest way , so that even a child might ascend in confidence . Youp122will follow . " He turned to the furcots . Geeliwan yawned nosily as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them fall , " he ordered . " Understand , " Ruumahum snorted . " Follow close . Will care for . " The massive skull swung around for a last thoughtful look , white tusks gleaming in the misty phosphorescence that surrounded them . " Go now . Something comes . " If either Logan or Cohoma had entertained thoughts of arguing for another avenue of ascent , perhaps one still less perpendicular , Ruumahum 's curt warning was enough to send them hurriedly up the chosen route . " We 've been left alone since extinguishing our torches , " Logan puffed . " Why would anything suddenly attack us now ? I thought we had made ourselves pretty inconspicuous . " " Your eyes have grown used to the light here , " Born shouted back to her . " Look down at yourselves . " Logan stared down at her protesting legs , and her breath drew in sharply . She was flickering like a thousand tiny lasers . Legs , feet , torso  --  all glittered crimson and yellow with light of their own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of her and even as she watched , the photonic effluence spread to her arms . Then she could feel a faint , feathery tickling spread across her face , and she brushed frantically at eyes , nostrils , and mouth . She fought down the panic when the feathery touch remained no more than that . Born was shining now , too , and Losting . She saw Jan staring at her , his electrified face a mirror of her own . Behind them , Ruumahum and Geeliwan were rippling streaks of light . A spine-quaking moan reverberated in the distance behind them . They redoubled their efforts . Actually the climb was not that difficult from a technical standpoint , merely nerve-wracking and arduous . It seemed to Logan that they had been climbing for days instead of hours . Once it grew darker for long moments as the luminescent fungi and lichen and mosses grew fewer and fewer . Another dozen meters and the first light from above reached them , feeble , tenuous probings of a far distant sun . Their acquired illumination left them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine her glistening palms . The infinitesimallights shifted and flowed , then began fading in a cloud from the skin . Tiny , incredibly tiny fliers , living light specks . That single soulfreezingmoan had now faded behind them , but it was no wonder they had suddenly become quarry for a while . For the billion glowmitesp123that had slowly gathered to them must have turned the moving forms of man and furcot into fiery silhouettes in the darkness , flickering , brilliant beacons beckoning to photosensitive predators . Another symbioticmarriage , she mused . This world offered hundreds and hundreds of such , in places unexpected and unique . They rose into thicker and thicker growth , not fungi now , but the stygian precursors of real plants . The first pale shadows formed by sunlight were like answers to prayers . First they climbed the air-roots that dangled from the larger parasitictrees and vines , then those of the lesser epiphytes and bushes . Eventually they emerged into the first leaves  --  enormous disks barely kissed with green . Some were more than five and six meters wide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fungi still flourished here , but reduced to a friendly , unthreatening size  --  not the nightmare colossi of the Seventh Level . Gigantic ferns , ivies , and unclassifiable bryophytes still crowded out flowering plants . " Please , let 's stop here , " pleaded an exhausted Cohoma , settling down on a wide vine overgrown with a diamond-patterned ivy . " For a minute , just a minute , please . " Logan collapsed alongside him . Born cast a questioning glance back at Ruumahum . The furcot was looking back along their perpendicular path , long ears cocked forward and down , listening intently . Then he turned . " Not climber , not follow . Danger gone . " What seemed to Cohoma only seconds later , Born tested a dangling root . A gratifying tug and he was pulling himself up the helical formation . Losting followed behind , his snuffler clattering against his cape . Cohoma looked at his partner , muttered something else Born would not have understood , and started to follow . Logan sighed , stood up and tried to stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to strains in other muscles . She grabbed the root and began climbing . Ruumahum and Geeliwan chose their own path . Additional hours of hard climbing carried them into something approaching a foggy twilight , where one finally could see without squinting . This time it was Logan 's turn to announce she could not move a step farther . Born and Losting consulted as the two giants collapsed in a bed of rectangular leaves so thick they looked like little boxes . " Very well , " Born told them , " we will stay the night here . " " The night ? " Cohoma wondered aloud . " But when the silverslith chased us out of that tree , it was already night . "  | " You must learn to read the light , " Born told him . " The sun is dying , not budding . We have traveled the rest of that night and run the following day . There is little enough time left for preparing a fire and shelter . " " Wait a minute . How do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Born waved at the surrounding forest . " One has only to emfol . " " Never mind , " Cohoma grunted . " Forget the superstition . I 'll take your word for it , Born . " His expression changed . " Are you and Lostinggoing to hunt , or are we going to have to masticate that boot material you call dried meat again ? " Born was unpacking his axe . " No time left to hunt , unless you would prefer fresh meat to shelter ? " " No thanks , " Logan cut in . " I 'd rather be dry  --  you have enough time ? " " There are many dead branches and dying leaves here , " Born told them . " And as low as we are in the world , drip water will not penetratetill late at night . Besides , this is still a region unfamiliar to us , this Sixth Level . Some of the forest growth is familiar , but some is not . The same is true of the sounds , and probably of the sound-makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . " " We will eat what we brought with us , " Losting said . " Tomorrow we can climb to the Third Level and hunt for fresh game , find fruit and nutmeats . For now , be glad of what you have . " " Look , " Cohoma explained , " do n't get the idea I was complaining or anything . " He remembered that they were here due to Born 's recklessness and curiosity , not Losting 's . " The steady change in our diet these past weeks has been kind of a shock to my innards . " " Do you think this is a feast for us ? " Born reminded him , and he and Losting moved off to search for any of the platterlike green disks they had passed that showed signs of blight or disease . Cohoma leaned back in the foliage until the two hunters had disappeared into the green wall . Then he rolled over and watched Logan , who was busy with the compass . " Still on course ? " She shrugged . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what you said before is true . We have to hit the station dead on . We 've got three chances to miss it  --  by going under it , too far right , or too far left . " He picked at the leaf they were sitting on . " I wish we had not had to make that surface detour , damnit "  | " Could hardly be helped . What 's the matter , Jan , did n't you find it interesting ? " " Interesting ? " He let out a sinister chuckle . " It 's one thing to study alien aberrations from the skimmer in back of a laser cannon . Being eaten alive by an entry in the catalog is the kind of experience I can do without . " " We 're going to have a problem soon , you know . " " Oh , you 're full of surprises , Kimi , you are . " " Seriously . If we 're not going to risk missing the station , we 're going to have to convince our friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of distance thrown off by our little raft ride , the sooner we move up in the world , the better . " " The station 's built only a little ways into the canopy , true . " " And Born and his people , " she continued , " are deathly afraid of the sky . Not as much as they are of the surface , though . " She looked thoughtful . " With that successfully survived now , maybe he 'll be a littleless reluctant to move upward . Remember , he does n't know the station is located at the top of the First Level . He may have come to half believe we do come from a world other than this one . I think that 's more likely to find place in his imagination than the possibility we might choose to live here in his Upper Hell . " Cohoma shook his head . " I still wish I understood what this emfol business is all about . It would seem to be some kind of adaptive worship of the undergrowth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underfoot for succor and supernatural aid ? The bottom of their world is hell , and so is the upper . That leaves them neatly sandwiched in between , with no way out . Naturally their development would proceed along restricted , unorthodox lines . It 's too bad , in a way . Born , the chiefs Sand and Joyla , and several others have a kind of nobility about them . " Cohoma snorted , rolled over . " The biggest mistake an objective observeron a world like this can make is to romanticize the primitive . And in the case of these people , even that 's not valid . They 're not true primitives , only regressed survivors of people like ourselves . " " Tell me , Jan , " she murmured , " is it really regression , or is it progression along an alien path ? " " Huh ? What 's that you said ? " " Nothing .. . nothing . I 'm tired , that 's all . "  |p126The  meal of tough dried fruit and tougher meat was long concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sitting . The hunter was resting close to the fire , his back pushed up against the bulk of the snoring Ruumahum . Losting was already asleep at the far end of the large , crude lean-to . Wrapped awkwardly in his brown cloak , her partner dozed fitfully . There was one important policy question she wanted to resolve now . " Tell me , Born , do you and your people believe in a god ? " " A god or gods ? " he replied interestedly , at least not offended by the question . " No , a single god . One all-powerful , all-seeing intelligence that directs the affairs of the universe , that accounts for and plans every-thing . " " That implies the absence of free will , " Born responded , surprising her as he sometimes did with a very unprimitive reply . " Some accept that , too , " she admitted . " I accept nothing of it , nor do any I know , " he told her . " There is far too much in this world for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you say there are other worlds as complex as this , too ? " He smiled . " No , we do not believe such . " At least she could go to Hansen with that much , now . It was too bad . Belief in the existence of a single god would imply a fixed set of ethical and moral precepts on which to base certain proposals and regulations . Spiritual anarchy made dealings with primitive peoples more difficult . One could n't call on a higher authority to serve as a binding agency . Well , that was a problem for Hansen and whatever xenosociologists the company chose to send in to deal with Born 's people . She started to turn away , then hesitated . If she could at least plant that seed in Born 's mind . " Born , has it occurred to you that we 've had incredible luck on this journey ? " " I do not call sleeping in a silverslith 's tree good luck . " " But we escaped it , Born . And there 've been any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen times we could all have been killed . Yet wep127have n't even suffered a minor injury , beyond the usual nicks and scrapes . " That caused him to think a minute , as she had intended . Finally he murmured , " I am a great hunter . Losting is a good hunter , and Ruumahum and Geeliwan are wise and experienced . Why should we not have been as successful as we have ? " " You do n't think it strange , despite the fact that five days ' journey is the longest any of your people have ever traveled from the Home before and returned ? " " We have not yet reached our destination , or returned , " he counteredquietly . " That 's so , " she admitted , edging back toward her own sleeping place . " So you do n't think this implies the intervention of a guiding , watchful presence , like a god ? One who always knows what 's good for you and watches over you ? " Born looked solemn . " It did not watch over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . " And he turned away from her . She had planted the seed . Satisfied with that and with what Hansen would have to say about it , she rolled up in her cloak and closed her eyes . Not that there were any missionaries at the station who would thank her . The station was hardly a Church-blessed enterprise . The steady drip of rain trickling down to this level through a million leaves and petals and stems formed a lulling rhythm on the lean-to roof , allowing her finally to fall asleep . " We 've got to go up to the top of the First Level , Born , " Logan insisted the next day . Born shook his head . " Too dangerous to travel so much in the sky . " No , no , " she went on in exasperation . " We do n't have to stick our heads out into open air . We can stay a good twenty-five meters , " and she translated that into percentage of level for him , " below the topmost leaves . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get at you . " " The First Level has dangers of its own , " Born countered defensively . " They are smaller than those of the Home.level , but faster , harder to find and kill before they strike . " " Look , Born , " Cohoma tried to explain , " we could miss the station completely if we travel below that point . It 's constructed  --  like our skimmer  --  out of materials set down into the forest top , but not far intop128it . If we miss it and have to try and backtrack , we could get so confusedas to direction that we 'd never be able to find it . We could wander around in this jungle for years . " For emphasis , he grabbed the compass , showed it again to Born and Losting as though they could comprehend its principle . " See this direction finder of ours ? It works best the first time you hunt with it for a place . It grows less useful with each successive failure . " Eventually Born gave in , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two choices  --  take their advice now , or abort the journey . After all they had been through , she did not think he would suggest the latter . So they continued upward . Gradually this time , not in a musclekillingvertical climb , but on a slant . In this manner they moved forward as well as higher , through the Fifth Level , the Fourth , and Third . She could sense their reluctance to leave those comforting , familiar surroundings for the danger and uncertainty of the upper canopy . Both she and Cohoma had grown so hylaea-wise by now , however , that neither hunter attempted to fool them into believing they had reached a higher level . Up they mounted , through the Second Level , where the sunlight was brilliant yellow-green , where it struck most vegetation directly and not with the aid of mirror vines . Where the day was bright enough to resemble the floor of a north temperate evergreen forest on Moth or Terra . Logan and Cohoma expanded , while Born and Losting grew steadily more cautious . Then they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of riotously colored flowers , etched and engraved and painted by a naturedelirious with her own beauty . Logan knew that any of the botanistsrestricted to the station and to studying specimens recovered by the skimmer teams would give an arm to be here with them now . Company policy forbade it , given the inimical nature of this world . Botanists were expensive . All the basic shadings and hues merged together with more exotic coloration . Logan passed a maroon bloom half a meter across , its pigment so intense it was nearly purple in places . The petals were striped with aquamarine blue , and it rested on a bed of metallic gold leaves . Nor was drunken variation limited only to color . One blossom boasted petals which grew in interlocking , multiple spirals of pink and turquoise and almond . Cohoma promptly dubbed it the clown plant.  |p129There  were flowers that grew like a phalanx of pikes , green flowers springing from green stems , and green branches that sprouted green grapes . There were flowers inside flowers , flowers the color of smoky quartz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these were matched in glitter and evolutionary exuberance by a swarming multitude of nonvegetable life , which crawled , hopped , glided , buzzed , and swung about like animated dreams before the spellbound gaze of the two skimmer pilots . Born was right  --  they were smaller and they moved faster , some darting across their pathway too rapidly to be seen as other than a blur . Hunters and gatherers here would have to work four times as hard to gather the same amount of food . There was greater natural competitionhere and , according to the hunters , greater danger as well . Which explained why the survivors of the trapped colony ship had chosen to forego this aerial paradise for the less competitive regions of the Third and Fourth Levels . Having observed the thunderous nightly storms from the comparative safety of the station , Logan assumedthe protection the depths offered from violent weather was another factor in their decision to descend . The noise might have been still another factor . It was deafening here . Much of it seemed to emanate from huge colonies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About half-a-meter long , they were slimly built and moved rapidly through the thinner branches with six-clawed legs . Hard-shelled limbs joined to a furry cylindrical body , one end of which tapered into a long , whiplike tail , the other ending in a snout like an aardvark 's . The familiar triple ocularswere set back of this , and behind them rose a single , flexible ridge of flesh , which appeared to be a sound sensor . They were the mockingbirds of this world , the hexapodal kookaburras , uttering everything from a high-pitched whistle to a tenor cackle . Tribes of them accompanied the party as it made its way through the vinepaths , offering unintelligible insults and suggestions . Occasionally one of the furcots would snarl menacingly at them and they would scatter , only to reappear when communal courage grew strong enough , to berate and admonish once again . Only boredom drove them off . Yet another reason for living lower down offered itself . Even here , many dozens of meters below the crowns of the trees , the branches and cubbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creepers thinned in proportion . More often than they liked , Logan and Cohomap130found themselves using their arms instead of their legs to move from one place to the next . When Born asked if they were tiring and wished to drop to more easily negotiable paths , both gritted their teeth , wiped the sweat clear from eyes and forehead , and shook their heads . Better to expend all one 's reserves here than risk passing below the station . They continued on that way , now and then dipping downward when the forest top thinned too much for Born 's comfort , rising again where the hylaea bulged into the sky . It rained early that night . For the first time since their skimmer had crashed , both giants were subjected to a thorough drenching before the two hunters could erect suitable shelter . Without hundreds of meters of intervening foliage to protect them , they caught the full force of the nightly downpour . The volume and fury they had anticipatedfrom having observed similar storms from inside the station . It was the noise that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had descended a good thirty meters more in hopes of securing a little protection . Even here the forest shook and rattled . Real , steady wind up here , not the lost , dallying zephyr they had encountered at the Home 's level . There was no soundproofing to shut out the lightning and thunder , which rattled their brains in counterpoint to the flogging rain . Logan sneezed , reflected miserably that the first colonists here could have perished from pneumonia had they not chosen to live at more sheltereddepths . It was only a momentary chill  --  the humidity and constantwarmth made it hard to catch the serious cold she feared . But when the sun rose steamily bright the following morning , both pilots remained soaked to their skin . Under the concerned directions of Born  --  and Losting 's more taciturncomments  --  they underwent a reeducation in the following days . This world nearer the sky was as deadly as Born had indicated ; only here the methodology of murder was matched in deadliness by the subtlety of execution . Without the advice and protection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giants would have been dead within a day . The danger which remained sharpest in Logan 's mind was a brilliant yellow fruit . Hourglass-shaped and about the size of a pear , its blossoms exuded a fragrance redolent of spring honeysuckle . The epiphytic bush was top-heavy with this fruit . Born pointed out how tokkers and other fruit-eaters assiduously avoided it . " Bitter taste ? " Cohoma asked  |p131Born  shook his head . " No , the taste is wondrous , and the pulp nourishing and rejuvenating to a tired wanderer . The danger is in separating the fruit from the seeds within . " " That 's a problem with most fruit , " the pilot observed . " It is a particular problem with the greeter fruit , " Born told him , as he reached up and casually plucked one free . After staring silently at the plant for a long minute , Logan noted  --  emfoling again . " No animal of the world has been able to solve the problem , " the hunter continued , turning the attractive , harmless-looking fruit over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He hunted around until he found a long , thin , dead branch growing from a nearby bush . Breaking it off cleanly , he sharpened one end with his knife . Then he slid the point into the fruit , taking care not to pierce the center . Laying the impaled fruit on a branch , he used the knife to make a multiple incision on the side away from the stick . Then he lifted the branch high overhead and began tapping the incised area firmly against the protruding knob of a small cubble . On the sixth tap there was a bang of such unexpected volume that Logan and Cohoma ducked . There was a violent snarl from their left . Ruumahum stuck his head out from a clump of wire bushes . Seeing that no one was injured , he uttered a snort of derision at such foolish goings-on and vanished once more . Born drew the stick downward , showed it to the giants . The whole left side of the fruit , where the incisions had been made , had been blown away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was exactly the case . " This is how the greeter spreads its seed , " Born explained needlessly . Peeling off sections of the remaining undamaged fruit , he extendedthem to Cohoma and Logan . Logan slipped it hesitantly betweenher lips , the recent demonstration having dampened her appetite somewhat . As soon as her taste buds made contact with it , she sucked in the whole piece and rolled it around in her mouth , squeezing the juices free . It was exquisite , sugary , yet tart , like grenadine and lemon . " What finally happens to the seeds ? " she asked , when the last drop was drained , the final scrap of pulp swallowed . By way of reply Born directed them upward and to the left of the parasitic bush . Born studied the trunk of the tree nearby , finally pointed . The pilots stared close . Arranged in a tiny , neat spray pattern on the trunk were a dozen small holes , penetrating the solid wood forp132several centimeters . At the bottom of each hole they could barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protruded from each seed . Each seed was perhaps a half-centimeter in diameter , including spines . With his knife , Born dug one of them out . Logan reached to touch it , and Born had to block her hand  --  had she learned nothing of the world these past many seven-days ? She and Cohoma studied the minute seed with interest . Closer inspection revealed that the edges of the six spines were razor-sharp and lined with microscopic , backwardfacingbarbs . " I see , " Cohoma murmured . " The seeds germinate in the trees . But how do they get spread ? Does the fruit dry up to the point where internal pressure sends them flying ? " " Ca n't be , Jan , " Logan objected . " If the fruit dries out , where 's the source of this kind of pressure ? No , it has to be  --  " Born shook his head . " The greeter does not root in a plant . When an animal which is old or ill has lost its judgment , hunger may drive it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logan paused long enough for another glance at the little spray patternwhere the seeds had bored holes in the thick hardwood , then followed the hunter . " An animal tries to eat one of the fruits , bites through the pulp until it punctures the inner sac and gets the whole barrage right in its face , " Cohoma theorized grimly . " If it 's lucky the seeds kill it outright . Otherwise it probably bleeds to death . Meanwhile the corpse serves as a ready-made reservoir of nutrients . " " Jan , the plants have struck an even balance on this world . No , I take that back . They have the upper edge . The animals are outnumbered , outsized , and outgunned . I wondered how Born 's ancestors could have lost so much technology so fast . I do n't wonder any more . How can you fight a forest ? " The discovery came days later , announced in the usual phlegmatic fashion of the furcots . " Pants , " Ruumahum called back to them . Both furcots were sitting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Born 's spirits rose . " A Panta is a large open space , a depression in the world . Of course , " he added hurriedly , seeing the look on the giants ' faces , " it might be a natural Panta . There are half a dozen within two days ' walk of the Home . " He turned back to Ruumahum . " How big ? " " Big , " the furcot replied softly . " And in middle , thing of axe metal like sky-boat . " Triple eyes stared suddenly at Logan.  |p133Without  knowing why , she looked away , concentrating instead on Born . " The station ! It 's got to be ! " " It is done , then . Quickly . " He turned to jog down the cubble . This time it was Logan who put out the restraining hand . " Not too quickly , Born . There are mechanisms  --  like our compass  --  which protectthe station from marauding forest-dwellers and sky-demons . No creature of the hylaea world can reach it . " " Silverslith ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even a silverslith . " The hunter persisted . " Has your station-Home ever been attacked by a silverslith ? " Logan had to admit it had not , but she was adamant in insisting that even that gigantic animal could not stand up to a gimbaled laser or explosive shell . Both hunters were forced to confess they had no idea what these magical weapons were . Cohoma assured them with a barely suppressed smile that they were more toxic than jacari thorns . " Then the demons of your own worlds must be far , far greater than even those of Hell , " Born surmised , " for you to need such weapons . " " They are , " she admitted , without bothering to explain that the demons in question were two-legged . Besides , now that they were within hailing distance of the station , there was an experiment she had been waiting all this time to try . She looked straight at Ruumahum . " All right , " she said in a commanding tone , " take us to the Panta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , then turned and trotted into the greenery ahead . Born said nothing . Perhaps in his mind the event held no significance . But it indicated to Logan and Cohoma that the furcots would respond to the commands of humans other than those of Born 's tribe . That could be most important in smoothing certain things over . A few more lianas , some two-meter-tall leaves , and a couple of branches eased aside  --  and they were standing on the fringe of what looked like a vast green circle paved with green , beige , and brown . The floor of the Panta was composed of the tops of hundreds , thousands of trees , cubbles , and epiphytes which had been sheared off to provide the station with a protective " moat " of open space devoid of concealment . In the center of the green-walled amphitheater the station itself rose on the cut-off crowns of three Pillar trees grown close together . They supported the whole weight of the station . The structure itself consisted of a single vast metal building with a sloping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
