To South Africa 's 17th century settlers , " going into laager " meant forming a circle with their covered wagons to defend themselves against attacks by native tribes . To their present-day descendants , it means turning increasingly to the repressive strictures of apartheid to protect themselves against the nonwhite majority . Five times since 1948 , the electorate has gone into laager by returning the white-supremacist , Boer-dominated Nationalist government to power , each time with increased majorities . Last week , for the first time in 22 years , South Africa 's voters took a short step back toward the moderate center . <P> Reduced Pension . In the 31 years since he succeeded the assassinated Hendrik Verwoerd as Premier , Johannes Balthazar Vorster has remained true to the goal of apartheid . Only last week , for instance , his government ruled that a retired soldier named Sam Dorkin had been reclassified as a mixed-blood " Colored " after 75 years of life as a white man ; his army pension was reduced from $61 to $29 a month . Nonetheless , Vorster has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He adopted an " outward-looking " policy of establishing trade and diplomatic links with a few black states in southern Africa , and he agreed to allow New Zealand 's rugby team , including some native Maoris , to compete in South Africa . <P> However gentle such maneuvers may seem , they infuriated the Nationalist Party 's extreme right-wingers-especially Dr. Albert Hertzog , 70 . Dropped from the Cabinet in 1968 and expelled from the party last September , Hertzog organized his own verkramptes ( narrow-minded ) group , which became known as the Reconstituted ( or " Purified " ) Nationalist Party . <P> <P> Worried by the extremists and anxious to prevent them from creating an effective organization , Vorster called for elections a year ahead of schedule and geared his campaign almost exclusively to the verkrampte challenge . Moving perceptibly to the right , he barred U.S. Black Tennis Star Arthur Ashe from playing in South Africa . Two weeks ago , he issued a decree prohibiting blacks from holding a wide range of semiskilled jobs . The order was set aside when businessmen pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As expected , the Nationalists won last week 's elections handily , and will have a two-to-one majority in the new Parliament . But they lost nine seats-not to the verkramptes but to the English-oriented United Party , a timid , ideologically sterile organization that favors token African representation . The tiny , anti-apartheid Progressive Party increased its total vote by one-third , and its lone member of Parliament , the spirited and courageous Helen Suzman , nearly tripled her 1966 lead . By contrast , Hertzog 's party failed to win a single seat ; all four of its M.P.s were defeated . Hertzog himself received only 926 votes out of 9,160 in the constituency he had held since 1948 . Observers believe that Hertzog 's fanaticism , which included a demand for suppressing the English language in South Africa , and the absence of any reassurance from Vorster , who was preoccupied with the Hertzog threat , stampeded many English-speaking voters into seeking a more moderate alternative .
