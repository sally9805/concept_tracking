Letters to the Editor On Dating Maps To the Editor : Maybe nobody cares , but I find mapmakers guilty of a great disservice to motorists : I refer to their failure to include the year in which the maps and atlases are published . This is a crime . Some old Esso maps carried the year on the cover , but most road maps ? even city and transit varieties ? omit the year , even when it says " copyright . " I have written Rand about this , and I personally think it is a help to orientation and a convenience as one travels to know instantly , without need to scour , how updated the map may be . All map publishers should take heed . ANTHONY S. MARIANO Levittown , L.I . Conroy V. Erickson , public relations director of Rand in Chicago , replies : We could not agree more with your letter writer . Dated road maps serve a variety of useful purposes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the choice entirely ours , we would date every road map , just as we do our annual " Rand Road Atlas : United States/Canada/Mexico . " The difficulty does not He with map makers , however , and particularly not with Rand . Today , most individual state road maps are no longer given away by oil companies through service stations . They are mostly purchased from map makers like Rand by distributors who in turn market them to retailers for sale " off the shelf " or through vending machines . For a period beginning in the 1960 's and up until about three years ago , we did clearly date maps , even though others usually did not . The nature of the business has changed , however , and distributors today tell us flatly they will buy their maps elsewhere if we insist on dating them . Part of the problem lies with the consumer . Our road maps and our " Road Atlas " are revised at least annually . But the consumer who in January sees the previous year 's date on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retailer " this year 's map . " Consequently , retailers and distributors feel they have fewer problems when dates are omitted entirely . Rail Fare Discrepancies To the Editor : I recently rode Amtrak from New York to Boston and return and , in my spare time aboard the train , examined the fare schedule shown in the current timetable . The fare from Boston to New York is $20.50 and to Newark ( just 10 more miles ) the fare is $22.50 . Why $2 to ride on to Newark on the through Boston-Philadelphia or Washington train ? The fare from New York to Newark is $1 on Conrail or Amtrak trains and on the PATH trains 33 cents . The New York-to-Washington coach fare is $23 for a 225-mile trip : the New York to Boston coach fare is $20.50 for a 223-mile trip . Is Amtrak using " new mathematics " to compute fares ? My complaint to Amtrak about the $2 differential on the Newark-Boston fare went unanswered . My 1938 New Haven Railroad timetable shows the " Merchants Limited " and " Yankee Clipper " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four-and-a-half hours with steam locomotives from New Haven to Boston . The Amtrak schedule today shows the " Senator " scheduled five hours from Penn Station to Boston . Time has been added to schedules because of track reconstruction . EDWARD T. FRANCIS Livingston , N.J. John , Amtrak public affairs officer in Washington , replies : The discrepancy in fares noted by Mr. Francis results from patterns of fare increases effected by Amtrak in recent years , and Amtrak intends to take a close look at them . The $2 difference between New York-Boston and Newark-Boston fares dates back to a November , 1974 , fare increase of 5 percent from which Amtrak exempted the Boston-New York segment of the Northeast Corridor . The difference between the New York-Washington and New York-Boston fares stems from a March , 1979 , fare increase , which was 10 percent for the New York-Washington segment of the Northeast Corridor but 6 percent elsewhere , including New York-Boston . Cross-Country by Train To the Editor : I was surprised to read in the article " Stephen Spender Views Chicago " ( Travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to cross the United States by rail . At present , four Amtrak routes extend from Chicago to the West Coast . Another line links New Orleans and Los Angeles . Even if the passenger train system is pared , as is planned , it will still be possible to journey from the Atlantic to the Pacific by train . CHARLES J. BARAN Queens Irish Spain ' To the Editor : David Alpern 's article , " Galicia , the Magnet for Pilgrims in Spain " ( Travel Section , June 17 ) , referred to the region as " Irish Spain , settled by the Celts . " He seems to imply that Galicia was settled by the Irish , which is not at all true . The Celts came in two waves of migration from central Europe , the first in about 1800-1600 B.C. ( CeltoLigurians ) , the second in 1000-300 B.C. ( Urnfield Celts ) . These peoples spread through most of Europe , and in two streams to the westernmost parts , the British Isles and the Iberian peninsula . There is no suggestion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later waves of migration ? in Britain the Angles , Saxons and Jutes , in Spain the Iberians , Romans , Visigoths and Moors ? successively overran these areas in later centuries , mixing with and displacing the Celts in the more accessible regions . However , the northwestern extremes in each case remained rather purely Celtic . The geographic similarity of Galicia and Ireland may be more than an accident : It may account for the failure of invading peoples to penetrate further , and it may account for the enduring ethnic similarities of these two branches of the Celtic family , despite the separation of so many centuries . ROSEMARY RINDER New York Fast Pace of Auctions To the Editor : A comment on Rita Reif 's article " Riches in Close-Up at Auctions " ( Travel Section , June 24 ) : To call John Marion 's auctioning of 60 lots an hour " fast-paced " is a serious error . Mr. Marion sells close to 90-100 lots an hour usually , but that is actually slow . Sotheby 's London silver sales handled by Richard Came average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misses a bid . Sixty lots an hour by anybody would be deadly dull . MALCOLM STEARNS JR . Haddam , Conn . Rita Reif comments : Of course John Marion can gavel 100 or more lots an hour . But 60 is fast when , as I said , " bidding is heated and there are many vying for an object . " An Open-and-Shut Case To the Editor : Joan Cook 's article , " A Tale of Family Camping " ( Travel Section , June 10 ) , spoke vividly to me since that sport was so much exercised during my growing-up years . I remember a flood similar to the one she described that occurred in a beach camp in southern Italy . But the experience I had that sun . ' passes any other occurred in Yugoslavia , when a gypsy managed to open my tent while I was asleep , climb over me , sneak out with my suitcase and just as quietly zip the tent closed . The police subsequently caught the man , but by this time he had sold half of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourage Miss Cook from camping abroad as I did ? in Oslo , Copenhagen , Corsica and the French Alps ? and I did so with great pleasure . ISABELLE FULLER Bronxville , N.Y . Cyprus To the Editor : It is disturbing to see a partisan political message being conveyed in Andrew Borowiec 's article , " What 's Doing in Cyprus " ( Travel Section , June 17 ) . The average reader may not detect it as such , but it will be clear to anyone aware of developments on Cyprus since the 1974 Turkish invasion . That message is one that has been official Turkish policy toward the Cyprus Question and to which the Republic of Cyprus is irrevocably opposed ? namely , division of the island into two separate states . To quote the article itself : " The two sectors have to be treated as separate countries . . . " " Each side has its own characteristics and the two civilizations have rarely been compatible . " " . . the island is divided into two zones , the southern , predominantly Greek and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The effect here is to polarize the island in the reader 's mind . The current division is as artificial as the MasonDixon Line . Turkish and Greek Cypriots were formerly dispersed throughout Cyprus and did live together with no less harmony , and perhaps more , than do ethnic groups elsewhere . But the subtle drift of the article leads the reader to conclude Cyprus would be better off as two separate states . In other words to perpetuate and legalize the current de facto partition of the island . The article also appears to give evenhanded treatment to both sides . The appearance of fairness is deceptive , implying north and south to be co-equal . But they are not . There is only one sovereign nation of Cyprus recognized by the United States and the world community and that is the Government of President Spiros Achilles Kyprianou . The so-called ( self-proclaimed ) " Turkish Federated State of Cyprus " in the north is a fiction and has absolutely no standing anywhere , including the United Nations . Oblivious to reality , the article actually promotes tourism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied by Turkey and where hotels ? valued at about $300 million ? have been illegally seized from former creek Cypriot owners . Finally , for more information on Cyprus the reader should be directed to the Republic of Cyprus Consulate General , not the Greek Consulate .
