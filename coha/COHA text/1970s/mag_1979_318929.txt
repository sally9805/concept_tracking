A look at the President 's men <P> Part I zinged the President . Now comes Part II , in the June issue of the Atlantic , and the President 's men get their lumps . <P> The White House staff , says former Speechwriter James Fallows , 29 , in the concluding installment of his reflections on " The Passionless Presidency , " functions like a " feudal system . " He adds : " By choosing stability , harmony and order as his internal goals , by offering few rewards for ingenuity and few penalties for dullness or failure , Jimmy Carter created an Administration in which people were more concerned with holding their jobs than with using them . " <P> In his first article , Fallows saw Carter as a man who " fails to project a vision larger than the problem he is tackling at the moment . " Carter 's aides , Fallows says in his second article , have fallen prey to the bureaucratic system that they once vowed to reform . He writes : " Run like a bureaucracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drained of zeal , obsessed with form , full of people attracted more by the side-dressings of their work than the work itself . " <P> Domestic Policy Adviser Stuart Eizenstat , he says , is typical of the Administration mold : " A skilled version of an unimaginative breed . " Georgians Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell , says Fallows , cultivate the laid-back style of " cool guys getting the job done without trying too hard or taking it all too seriously . " One of the few to win a favorable notice is National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , " high-strung and vain , " but also " the one among Carter 's senior associates who tried every day to test the limits of his job and come up with new ideas . " <P> In the White House depicted by Fallows , errors , of which Congressional Liaison Frank Moore 's have been " the most flagrant , " are ignored out of a misguided sense of loyalty . " The goal was orderly performance . The virtues of an organization man-preserving order , preventing errors-were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more imaginative policies , broader sources of information , even better speech drafts would violate these principles of order , it was not likely to prevail . " <P> Despite his criticism , Fallows still clearly admires Carter , and concludes : " Carter is still the best hope for some day bringing the Government under control . " No other potential President , from Kennedy to Connally , " would be more likely to recognize the bureaucratic pitfalls than a re-elected President Carter with four years of painful education behind him ; nor would they offer the stability of character that is Jimmy Carter 's greatest strength . " The final verdict : " I am prepared to vote for him again . "
