The rival cruise missiles vie for a lucrative contract <P> Several thousand feet above a bleak patch of western Utah , a 20-ft. long , cigar-shaped drone dropped from a B-52 bomber , spread its stubby wings and began whipping around an oval course 100 miles long and 30 miles wide at speeds up to 500 m.p.h . So last Tuesday began the great flyoff to pick the first U.S. air-launched cruise missile ( ALCM ) , a weapon capable of carrying a nuclear warhead some 1,350 nautical miles and delivering it on target with near pinpoint accuracy . The weapon is designed to boost the nation 's atomic punch in the mid-1980s . <P> General Dynamics Corp . built last week 's contestant ; its competition , constructed by Boeing Corp. , is scheduled to have its turn this week . Each model will be given ten tests strapped to a B-52 to enable the missile 's guidance system to fly the bomber . Each model will also have ten freeflight tests . Some will be like last week 's exercise , while others will follow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Should an ALCM go astray , an F-4 Phantom jet flying along would take over its guidance system . <P> The tests compare the two models in such categories as navigation , targeting and range . Even more crucial is the ability to survive projected Soviet countermeasures . Explained William Perry , chief of Pentagon Research and Engineering : " We will put these missiles on our radar measurement range and make very detailed measurements of their radar cross sections . The data will be fed into a computer for simulations that predict what kind of performance we will get against different sorts of air defenses . " <P> For Boeing and General Dynamics , the flyoffs payoff is huge . Each ALCM is estimated to cost only $1 million ( vs. $5.8 million for a submarine 's Trident I ICBM ) . However , the Pentagon plans to order 3,000 , making the prime contractor 's share about $2 billion . By early next year , the contest results are to be announced and the first ALCM-armed B-52 could enter the bomber fleet by December 1981 . <P> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SLCM ) . A General Dynamics Tomahawk had its sixth successful underwater firing last week off California . Planned mainly as an antiship weapon , the SLCM can carry a conventional or nuclear warhead about 300 nautical miles . By 1982 , the first of these weapons are to be deployed on U.S. warships .
