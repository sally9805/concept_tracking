Italians like to dramatize an extraordinary occasion by describing it with a singular expression . It happens , they say , ogni morte di Papa - only when a Pope dies . The death of a Pope is indeed a momentous news event , and to cover the death of Paul VI and the beginning of the process to choose his successor TIME took some extraordinary measures . Rome Bureau Chief Jordan Bonfante , detached temporarily to New York , flew back immediately . Rome Correspondent Roland Flamini heard the bulletin of the Pope 's death while packing his bags for a story assignment about crowded European beaches . The bags stayed unpacked , and Flamini put to use the knowledge he had accumulated by writing a just completed book on Vatican diplomacy in the 1960s . London Correspondent Erik Amfitheatrof did double duty , filing first from Canterbury , England , on the Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops , then heading for Rome to make contact with sources he had developed while covering the Vatican from 1975 to 1977 . <P> The three correspondents , plus a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Vatican to gather new data that supplemented the files on Paul 's possible successor , which had been building for three years . In the end , as always , getting the story was a matter of legwork . The correspondents used Vatican sources carefully nurtured over the years . They met and interviewed foreign Cardinals as they arrived in Rome . One good spot for news has always been the exit at the Vatican used by the Cardinals after finishing their daily meetings to plan the conclave . Meanwhile , the top editors of TIME held their own modest conclave in a 25th floor office of the Time-Life Building to decide-with collegial advice from TIME correspondents and a plethora of other sources-which papal candidates should be featured on our cover and in the story . <P> Working with files from Rome and around the world , Richard Ostling , TIME 's Religion editor , wrote the cover story , which was researched by Clare Mead Rosen and Sara Medina . The accompanying story on the papal candidates was done by Associate Editor Mayo Mohs , a former Religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for last week 's issue . <P> All in all , it was a remarkable week-one that had begun the previous Sunday afternoon when we stopped the presses to get the obituary into 95% of our domestic run . Ogni morte di Papa , as the Italians say .
