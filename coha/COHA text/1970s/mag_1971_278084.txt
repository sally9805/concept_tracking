Unfortunately , we live in an age when such men are no longer admired but ridiculed and pitied for fighting bravely for a country in which they believe . <P> SHARLENE MCEVOY Derby , Conn . <P> <P> Obscurity of the Obvious <P> Sir : Mr. Donovan 's statement in " Coming to Terms with Viet Nam " June 14 that " we may well have accomplished more in South Viet Nam than in our present mood we give ourselves credit for " is a repetition of a theme that no one has thus far been inclined , or able , to clarify for the ordinary mind . We are still faced with the " obscurity of the obvious .
