Even before the opening bell rang , the traders , specialists , clerks and messengers who work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange sensed that Wednesday would not be an ordinary day . The Federal Reserve Board 's decision to raise the prime rate had already rocked the stock market , triggering a frenzied sell-off that had sent the market plummeting by a startling 26 points on Tuesday-the worst setback it had suffered in nearly six years . Now , at brokers ' booths and trading stations , everybody was fretting about what worried investors would do next . " We 're going to get sellers , " said one broker as he strode onto the floor . <P> His prediction proved correct . As an unseasonable October snowfall swirled outside , a far fiercer storm began to rage inside the exchange . Only minutes after trading opened , brokers were deluged with orders to sell . By the time trading had been under way for an hour , everyone realized that the rush was on . " It 's almost a total panic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their haste to sell . " More dramatic than anything I 've seen since the assassination of President Kennedy . The institutions and banks are selling , but they are n't as dramatic as the public . The public always seems to overreact . They 're just calling up and saying , ' Sell my stuff ! Get out of my position ! ' " His experience was not unique . At brokerage houses around the city , investors were trying to cut their losses . By 11:30 , only 1 hrs. after trading began , the Dow Jones average was off by 13 points and falling . " I would n't call it panic , " said Steven J. Hyman , an independent , or so-called $2 broker . " Let 's say it 's controlled pandemonium . " <P> Even on a routine and relatively quiet day , the floor of the New York Stock Exchange is like an anthill that has been suddenly kicked open . Men in suits from Brooks Brothers and F.R. Tripler move briskly from booth to trading station , clutching slips of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to keep up with orders . Messengers dart in and out of the trading area , while overhead , in symbols seemingly as cryptic as the writing that appeared on the walls of Belshazzar 's palace , projectors display the quotations off the stock tapes . <P> Under the best of circumstances , the exchange floor contains the makings of enough ulcers and coronaries to fill a good-sized hospital . By noon Wednesday , the circumstances were close to the worst ever . " Better get down here , " one broker telephoned a friend . " We 're going to break some records today . " <P> By early afternoon , the market was down 20 points and the tape , which had already been delayed half a dozen times , was running nearly half an hour behind the trading . As it did so , the tension increased . At one booth , a cheer went up as a stock that had been doing poorly all morning started to rise . The cheer turned to silence and then to boos as the stock , like a plane that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a trading station , a specialist berated a clerk who had just placed a slice of pizza on a pile of papers . " Dammit ! " he shouted . " The bottom 's falling out of the market , and you 're stuffing your face with mozzarella ! "
