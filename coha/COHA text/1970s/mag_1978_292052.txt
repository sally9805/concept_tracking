A game that caused 20 deaths <P> While workers were preparing to transfer 20,000 gal . of liquid propane gas from a derailed tank car to trucks in Waverly , Tenn. , the gas suddenly exploded , leveling 14 buildings . " It was just like you were thrown into a furnace , " said Truck Driver Carl Stokes , who was burned severely . " It was like a power throwing us into the sun . People were walking , their clothes were gone and their bodies were completely burned . " The toll : twelve dead and at least 50 injured . <P> Two days later , as a 140-car freight train rumbled by tiny Youngstown in Florida 's panhandle , all five locomotives hurtled off the track , piling up 47 cars like jackstraws . From one ruptured tanker poured a cloud of deadly , yellowish-green chlorine gas . Engineer Ray Shores grabbed his portable short-wave radio and sprinted 75 yds. to a swamp , where he burrowed deep into the mud and called for help . <P> When the gas spread across nearby Route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuhn , who was driving home to New York from a skindiving vacation in Florida . Then his van stalled and he got a whiff of the searing vapor . Kuhn strapped on his scuba air tank and walked out of the death cloud to safety . Another motorist , Donald Sellers of Tallahassee , a veteran of Army chemical-warfare training , recognized the gas as chlorine and told his wife to get to the floor of the car , where there was still breathable air . " We were both vomiting , " he said . " The car was a mess . Fortunately , we had just eaten . The doctors said the food absorbed a lot of gas . " <P> Ambulance Driver Doug Lister and his partner , Marty Shipman , were the first rescuers to reach the twisted wreckage . Said Shipman : " Suddenly I could n't breathe . I started screaming at Doug to get the hell out of there . " Added Lister : " I was spitting up blood . I felt like I was breathing flames . I thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulance into reverse and rush away . Others were not so lucky : eight people died and 50 were injured . <P> Also last week , a 101-car Illinois Central Gulf train jumped the tracks in Cades , Tenn . Among the derailed cars was one filled with caustic sodium hydroxide . Two days later 33 cars of a 91-car train , including one flatcar with a truck trailer containing 200 cases of flammable insecticide , derailed near Bowling Green , Ky . In neither accident were there any deaths or injuries . <P> Not for nearly a decade have U.S. railroads had such a wretched five days . <P> Federal investigators blamed the Youngstown wreck on sabotage-someone had unbolted two sections of rail . But the other three derailments apparently were caused by mechanical failures : broken wheels in Waverly and Bowling Green , and a broken brake assembly in Cades . Indeed , the tracks and much of the equipment belonging to U.S. railroads have been deteriorating for years , and experts agree that the situation is steadily worsening . Last year there were about 8,000 derailments-3,000 more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank cars leaked dangerous chemicals .
