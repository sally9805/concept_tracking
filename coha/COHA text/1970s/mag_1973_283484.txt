" Just wait until you see us fly , " said Russian Test Pilot Mikhail Koslov . " Then you 'll see something . " Koslov 's pride in his airplane seemed justified . Nearly everyone who attended the Paris Air Show agreed that the Russian supersonic transport , TU-144 , was a more impressive-looking craft than its smaller but graceful rival , the Anglo-French Concorde . The final day of the show last week was mostly devoted to flying exhibitions . The Concorde was the first of the SSTs to perform under the canopy of gray clouds that loomed over Le Bourget Airport . As 350,000 spectators watched , French Pilot Jean Franchi put his big bird through a ten-minute series of brilliantly controlled maneuvers and turns . He ended the performance with a fast pass over the field and a spectacular " zoom climb . " <P> Then it was Koslov 's turn . After a slow flight over the runway , the TU-144 started an even more awesome zoom climb , afterburners streaking yellow flame and turbofans thundering . " My God , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how he can do it ! " At 3,000 ft. , Koslov began flattening his climb . The plane 's needle nose pointed downward , then the craft went into an arrowhead plunge as the pilot struggled to regain control . The stress was too great . At 2,000 ft. , the left wing ripped off first , followed by the tail and right wing . There was a flash of fire , and the plane fell apart . All six crewmen were killed , as well as seven residents of the village of Goussainville , where 20 homes were destroyed by the debris . <P> The exact cause of the crash may never be known unless the Russians can recover more data from the TU-144 's damaged flight recorder . Most experts blame Koslov for trying to force the TU-144 through maneuvers better suited to a fighter than an airliner . The real question , though , was not what caused the disaster but what effect it would have on the development of the SST . The French and British have had scant success in selling their enormously expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians clearly had hoped that the Paris show would boost the TU-144 , which is not only cheaper ( $23 million including spare parts ) but also more economical to operate . That hope went down with the plane . It will take months to determine whether supersonic travel itself is still a dream or a reality for the mid- ' 70s.
