txt Congress wants to know more about the personal financial position of the man who is trying to put the nation 's budget in order . Budget Director Bert Lance , a friendly , open man who stands 6 feet , 4 inches and weighs 240 pounds , appears July 25 before the Senate Government Operations Committee to tell about a$3.4 million loan he got just before joining the administration . Ile got it from the big First National Bank of Chicago . A month earlier , Mr. Lance 's own bank , the National Bank of Georgia , deposited $200,000 in the Chicago bank . The situation leading to Mr. Lance 's testimony on his dealings with the Chicago bank arises from a favor the budget director asked of Congress . In confirmation hearings he pledged to avoid the possibility of conflict of interest by divesting himself of 200,000 sharesof his bank 's stock by the end of 1977 . But news of the prospective sale , together with unsatisfactory real estate loans made by the bank , dropped the value of the shares from $17 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million if Mr. Lance sold now . Accordingly , he has asked Congress for more time to dispose of his shares . Hence the congressional probe of the budget director 's personal financial affairs came as a result of an appeal by // From page 1 . Lance 's chance to explain his loans Mr. Lance himself , supported by President Carter . Mr. Carter has called Mr. Lance " one of the closest friends I have in the world , " and is believed to be influenced by the former 's conservative fiscal outlook , which strongly stresses a balanced federal budget in 1981 . Mr. Carter , too , has feelingly noted the sacrifice of men of affairs who give up large salaries to accept public service ? in Mr. Lance 's case a $100,000-a-year salary for $57,000 yearly to head the Office of Management and Budget . Mr. Lance has substantial resources , as well as debts . In an unusually full disclosure during confirmation proceedings , he listed assets in real estate at $1.3 million , stocks in 146 companies at $5.6 million , and cash holdings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1951 in the Calhoun ( Georgia ) National Bank . Mr. Lance 's rise included an unsuccessful political try at the Georgia governorship in 1974 . On the debit side , Mr. Lance owes $3.4 million to the National Bank of Chicago ; around $1.5 million to four smaller banks ; and mortgages of around $400,000 . This requires annual interest of around $373,000 . In view of these figures , the important question , in the view of many , is whether a government official should be advising on banks and interest rates when he has substantial bank loans himself . Mr. Lance has twice appeared before the Governmental Affairs Committee to discuss hi ? owa loan , and has promised the Senate Banking Committee not to take part in budget decisions on banks . Mr. Lance opposed rises in the prime inter- est rates charged by banks in public statements earlier in the year . It is argued by some that his own debt service payments rise and fall with such interest rates .

But a slashing attack by New York Times columnist William Safire ( " Carter 's Broken Lance " ) , along with Washington Post news reports , have raised some thorny issues . Among them : ? Shortly before the First National Bank of Chicago lent Mr. Lance $3.9 million , his Georgia bank entered into a " correspondent bank " relationship with it and deposited $50,000 in a noninterest-bearing account . There was no connection , Mr. Lance 's spokesmen say . Small banks often maintain such accounts in big banks for handling their paper work ; the Bank of Georgia has 14 such relationships , they note . ? The Lance bank in February , 1976 , received an $18 million trust account from a unit of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , which has been accused in the past of playing politics with its fund . Mr. Lance says he had nothing to do with it . The affable banker and politician is regarded as one of the most influential Carter advisers . He is gregarious , soft-spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He has taken the conservative side , successfully urging Mr. Carter to drop the proposed $50 income tax rebate and repeatedly stating that the President 's " prime goal " is a balanced budget in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 , 1980.
