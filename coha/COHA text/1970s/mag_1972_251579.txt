YOU 'VE never had it so good , " Israel 's prestigious newspaper Ha'aretz told its readers last week as it editorially noted the second anniversary of the Suez Canal ceasefire . Few Israelis would disagree . Not only has there been no shooting along the canal , but terrorism by Arab fedayeen is down sharply , and , most important , the threat of a confrontation with Russia was removed when Soviet forces withdrew from Egypt . For the first time in all of its 24 years , Israel had no challenger in the Middle East-and in many ways was finding the new situation more difficult to cope with than the threat of war . <P> As Israelis looked on last week , relations between Egypt and the Soviet Union deteriorated to what Beirut 's An Nahar called " the cold war stage . " Each country recalled its ambassador from the other 's capital for consultations , and when Soviet Party Boss Leonid Brezhnev sent a note to Egypt 's President Anwar Sadat urging " consolidation " of their " friendship , " Cairo spokesmen publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meantime , top U.S. officials speculated that the Soviet pullout may have gone further than Sadat originally intended-that when he asked the military advisers to leave , the Soviets took their air defense units too . Since those Soviet missiles had stopped Israel 's penetration raids into Egypt in 1970 , the effect was to leave that country at the mercy of the Israeli air force . <P> Sharp Division . Israel thus had an unprecedented opportunity to seek real peace with its neighbors . So far , the government has shown no signs of wanting to seize that opportunity . To be sure , no one expected serious negotiations to begin until after the U.S. elections . Even Egypt 's Premier Aziz Sidky and Foreign Minister Murad Ghaleb have indicated that they see no hope for the mission of United Nations Mediator Gunnar Jarring , which is supposed to get under way again this month . But Israel 's response to the Soviet withdrawal has been to stand pat , publicly calling for direct negotiations in full knowledge that Egypt would refuse ; Cairo considers direct talks tantamount to Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its faade of unity , Israel 's Cabinet is sharply divided on just what terms to offer . At issue is the question of the territories-Egypt 's Sinai and Gaza Strip , Jordan 's West Bank and the Arab quarter of Jerusalem , Syria 's Golan Heights-that Israel has occupied since the 1967 war . Israel has so far refused to budge from those territories on the grounds that it needs secure borders against the Arabs . But what happens when that threat is removed ? Three factions in the Israeli Cabinet suggest different solutions : <P> &gt;One faction is led by Premier Golda Meir and Defense Minister Moshe Dayan . They want to maintain the status quo-in effect to keep all or most of the occupied territories . Last month , at a meeting of Labor Party leaders , Dayan demanded what one critic called " practical annexation . " Dayan would like to create an economic union between those Arab areas and Israel , with a free flow of labor and capital . Arabs would be allowed autonomy on purely local matters .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
