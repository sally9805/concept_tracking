Do wild animals have rights ? Ask a Newfoundland sealer or those who weep for the baby seals . Ask a Japanese whaler or the housewife on Fifth Avenue picketing Sony and Subaru . Rights ? The answer is muddled by different value systems . Now , in Ohio , another battle has been joined . The weapons are a sprinkling of reason and a torrent of trickery . The issue is an amendment to the state constitution concerning the trapping of wild fur-bearing animals , specifically with the leg-hold trap , and whether its use should be allowed . The leg-hold is the only trap that will consistently take fox , Ohio 's most valuable animal , whose pelt sells for up to $42 . But its opponents call the trap " a fiendish instrument of torture . " // The leg-hold consists of a spring and two smooth steel jaws  --  teeth are no longer legal  --  which snap shut when an animal trips a lever between them . Injury is less likely to be caused by the snapping than by the animal 's frantic efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be tended at least once every 24 hours . Trappers say animals do not panic that quickly , and they talk of releasing dogs and house cats unharmed . Opponents , though , say the 24-hour law is not enforced , and they talk of finding feet that have been chewed off in desperation , or of skeletons in neglected traps . They suggest the use of the Conibear trap , which kills instantly , though it would not catch foxes and in the larger sizes could kill cats and dogs . But there is no disagreement about the extent of Ohio 's trapping industry , whose harvest of 1,108,881 pelts in 1975-76 was second only to Louisiana 's 2,258,226. // Last year 50,000 Ohio trappers were paid $9,917,466 for their furs , an average of almost $200 per man . Some made upwards of $2,000 , and whether they will continue to do so depends to a large extent on what happens with Issue 2 in the general election on Nov. 8 . " Yes " is a vote for the animals , " No " for the trappers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foxes , raccoon , muskrat , possums and mink , not to mention the earnings of 50,000 trappers. // " Vote yes on Issue 2 , " say the clever TV spots of humorist-adman Stan Freberg . In one of them , two hunters are walking along a wooded path ; one steps over a log into an open leg-hold trap and  --  snap ! The hunter 's consternation is adequately depicted , but , of course , the ad does not mention that Ohio law requires all traps to be set away from paths used by humans . It also does not say that the trap shown is a No. 4 , which might cause problems to a man , but that any size over No. 2 is illegal in the state . // Freberg 's ads concentrate on the trap itself . The opposition assaults the TV audience with visions of rabies epidemics , claiming that hordes of untrapped foxes will outstrip their food supply and become susceptible to the disease . In one ad , Dr. John Ackerman , director of the Ohio Department of Health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parks and playgrounds may have to be closed . Who knows what to believe ? A 1973 report of the National Academy of Sciences distributed by the anti-leg-trap people says that trapping campaigns as a means of rabies control should be abolished , that there is no evidence they reduce the incidence of the disease . // Another pro-trap ad shows a man and woman relaxing on their porch , a peaceful small town scene . There is then a cut to a swarm of rats , and a voice intones , " Vote against the spread of disease . " Demagoguery ? As the Cleveland Press said in its editorial urging a No vote on Issue 2 , " The amendment is so imprecisely worded that a person could be hauled into court for setting a mousetrap . " That sounds farfetched , but it may not be ; there are animal-welfare people in Ohio who might gladly use a leg trap , a No. 4 , if they could find the person who wrote the amendment . // Section 1 reads : " To prohibit any person from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild birds or wild four-legged animals ( quadrupeds ) and also to prohibit any person from using any trapping device in a manner that will cause continued , prolonged suffering to such birds and animals . " // As the Akron Beacon Journal said in its editorial , " Any trapping device can , in fact , cause continued , prolonged suffering . The trapping people are not raising a false issue when they say the amendment could easily be interpreted as a ban on all trapping . " // But the latter part of the amendment is causing even more concern . It reads : " To provide that any person may bring civil action for an injunction to stop a violation and to recover costs and attorney 's fees . " // This provoked the Ohio State Bar Association to release a statement opposing Issue 2 , although it said , " The ... Association takes no position on the moral issue of using leg-hold traps in capturing animals .... // " This section encourages harassment lawsuits . Issue 2 , if passed , would award attorney fees only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for paying costs of defending such lawsuits , even though the defendants may win the case . The possibilities of abuse are endless . Those wishing to harass others could have everything to gain and nothing to lose in bringing suit . This potential weapon is extremely dangerous in a system of justice based on fairness . " // The various controversies have clouded the issue , which is a pity , because it is fundamental and profound : Are wild animals to be treated as individuals , with kindness , or as a resource to be harvested , like corn ? The trappers are not cruel men . They love their dogs . But their concern is for the welfare of animal populations and not with Rocky Raccoon or Alvin Chipmunk . That is what has come out of numerous debates , such as one held recently in the Cleveland suburb of Avon Lake . The speakers might as well have addressed each other in Greek . // Speaking for Issue 2 was Bill Brown , a 53-year-old NASA research engineer . In 1975 he had tried unsuccessfully to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose members asked him , " Do animals feel pain ? " Because Ohio is one of 23 states whose constitution can be amended by petition , he took that route this year . The International Fund for Animal Welfare ( the group fighting the baby harp seal hunt in Newfoundland ) , of which Brown is a member , contributed $350,000 to the petition drive and campaign , and Brown and his wife Carol led the drive , getting the required 420,000 signatures . Now , in the Avon Lake United Church of Christ hall , Brown was saying , " If we win , fox trappers will lose some money , but it will encourage the invention of more humane traps . And we will be extending the pity and compassion we give to domestic animals to wild animals . " // Clyde Simmerer , a state wildlife biologist , did not respond to Brown 's statement . " These animals , " he said , " are not endangered in Ohio . But their natural enemies are gone , the large predators . The alternative to trapping is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , " I have found no scientific evidence that trapping is necessary to control populations . But I represent the cause of individual animals . They feel pain . Someone has to consider that , and I object to calling the killing of animals a harvest . It makes them sound like grains of corn . " // Simmerer responded , " I see no reason why people should n't profit from trapping , " thus  --  considering what had been passing for debate in Ohio  --  putting the logic of both sides on the line . // In the days following the debate , the campaign began heating up . One pro-trapping group distributed flyers from an organization called Kindness In Nature 's Defense , one of which observed that " mosquitoes are part of nature 's plan , " and urged its readers not to kill them . Another said , " If you know people who just wo n't give up fishing even when you tell them it 's not right to kill anything ' just for fun , ' ask them to use artificial flies instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // These , obviously , were scare tactics designed to link the Kindness organization to the anti-leg-trap people and to convince a wary electorate that if Issue 2 were to pass , fishing and hunting would be the next to go . The election was fast approaching . The voters of Ohio deserved less inflammatory material with which to make up their minds .
