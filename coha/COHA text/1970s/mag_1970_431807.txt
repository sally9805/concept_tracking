 | To take us in imagination to the farthest reaches of our solar system , the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC has teamed its award-winning science writer Kenneth F. Weaver with the noted Czech painter of astronomical subjects , Ludek Pesek . Their work reflects the knowledge gained from American and Soviet deep-space probes . It incorporates the latest thinking of leading U. S. authorities on each of the planets , and for their many contributions to the interest and accuracy of this presentation we are deeply grateful. ?

Sometimes they disappeared for weeks at a time . To some ancient shepherds , who in imagination saw a herdsman in the constellation Bootes , these five mavericks were stray animals . The Greeks called them planetes , or wanderers . The Romans gave them names of their gods : Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn . And from earliest recorded times , astrologers ascribed mystical qualities to these celestial bodies , as well as to the sun and the moon , teaching that they affected the destinies of nations and of kings . The Babylonians , who embraced the notions of astrology , associated the planet Jupiter with the god Marduk , a benign power . Saturn they linked to Ninurta , the god of war . Mars , whose ruddy color suggested blood , was a sign of Nergal , god of the underworld .

Already Copernicus had proved ( in a book published the year of ath , 1543 ) that the sun , not Earth , the center of things .

All that has been changing in the past dozen years . Solar-system astronomy is again in ferment , and the ' 70 's promise to be the decade of planetary investigation . Powerful new tools , such as radar and radio telescopes , sensitive detectors of infrared and other invisible radiations , sounding rockets and spacecraft that climb beyond Earth 's clouded atmosphere , are beginning to produce an avalanche of information and a number of surprises . They have challenged many of our most cherished notions about the planets , and have proved how little we really knew about our neighbors . Venus , for example , once supposed to be a well-watered twin of Earth , is really an inferno . Ridiculously , it rotates backward ! Mercury , which was long thought to keep the same face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a furnace and its eternally dark back side the coldest place in the solar system , embarrassingly does indeed turn its face from the fire . And Mars , the abode of a race of intelligent canal builders in the eyes of Percival Lowell and his followers at the turn of the century , has proved to have no canals and offers no evidence of water in liquid form , or of anything else that would encourage life as we know it on Earth . One of today 's specialists on planets , Dr. Bruce C. Murray , Professor of Planetary Science at the California Institute of Technology , sums it up this way : " We find that most of the ideas we had about Mars were wrong ; in fact , most of the ideas we have about any celestial body prove wrong when we get real knowledge about it .

The Soviet Union has plunged three transmitting space probes into the dense atmosphere of Venus . " This decade , " says NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine , " the entire solar system is the goal . No one knows how ambitious the Russian plans are , but before the end of the ' .970 's the United States hopes to send unmanned spacecraft racing toward every single ale of the planets . " These robots from Earth will take pictures , miff the atmospheres , gauge temperatures and pressures , measure radiations and magnetic fields , and ? in the case of Mars ? look for evidences of life .

What can we learn about the missing chapters in the history of our own planet that will help us to understand better the workings of Earth and to solve the problems of our environment ? Dr. Von R. Eshleman , of Stanford University , echoes the feelings of many scientists when he says , " We need examples from other planets to guide our thinking and to throw new light on our attempts to understand puz : : ing terrestrial phenomena . " Let us take a look at this family of the sun , ; vith its 9 planets and 32 satellites and thousands of asteroids and comets , stretching over a domain at least 8 billion miles across ? so far that light , traveling at 186,282 miles a second , requires half a day to cross it .

Earth Suppose we visit each planet , seeing it as if we were aboard an unmanned NASA spacecraft that will approach it sometime within the next few years . As a base for comparison , let us start with Earth . How would our planet look to men and instruments in spacecraft from another planet , orbiting above and then landing on the surface to make observations ?  | I can imagine that these extraterrestrial astronauts might make brief entries in their log something like this : Blue-and-white planet ? only one in this system .

In reality , even an observer on the surface of Venus could see no such panorama , for the planet 's atmosphere ? about a hundred times denser than Earth 's ? would blind like a thick fog . Brutally hostile , the planet broils at nearly 1,000 ? F. beneath a smothering carbon-dioxide atmosphere that traps solar heat by the " greenhouse effect . " Yet Venus works her charms . For us she glows faithfully as the morning and evening " star . " Light from Venus , the brightest heavenly body except for the sun and the moon , can cause earthbound objects to cast a faint shadow on moonless nights . @# Venus In the autumn of 1973 , if NASA 's plans hold , an Atlas-Centaur rocket will launch a Mariner spacecraft on a voyage to Venus and Mercury , the two planets lying between Earth and the sun .

This mission , like all those planned for the planets in the ' 70 's , will be unmanned . But imagine that you are aboard as the spaceship approaches its first goal , Venus . The date is between February 3 and 6 , 1974 , and your spacecraft has been on the way for more than three months . " Time : One hour before closest approach . We are coming in on Venus 's dark side . Only a sliver of the lighted side of the planet is clearly visible . Behind us , 28 million miles distant , our home planet has shrunk to a brilliant " star " *All flight information in this article is based on tentative plans now being refined by Caltech 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and ( for the Pioneer missions to Jupiter ) NASA 's Ames Research Center . Figures may vary on the actual missions . @# 158 National Geogra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our messages , traveling at the speed of light , take two and a half minutes to reach the 210 foot radio dish at Goldstone , California . The sun , only 67 million miles away , has grown a third larger than it appears from Earth . Now twice as much solar heat and light beat down upon our spacecraft . As we curve around the planet , the glowing crescent rapidly enlarges . At closest approach ? about 3,100 miles away ? a half Venus nearly fills our field of vision , shining brilliantly with a slightly yellowish color . Then the entire dazzling spectacle sweeps into view as we swing on around and head for Mercury ; Venus is more than three times as bright as Earth if seen from the same distance . During the flyby , our cameras are taking pictures of the scene and our instruments are recording temperatures and other information about the planet 's environment . All we can see , however , is an expanse of dense clouds . That is all any man has ever seen of Venus . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what lurks below that veil is an awesome world of unbearable heat and pressures and of terrifying distortions . Back on Earth , scientists have just begun to crack the many mysteries of Venus . By piecing together evidence from earth-based radar , from the Soviet probes ( Venera 4 in October 1967 and Venera 5 and 6 in May 1969 ) , and from our own Mariner 2 in December 1962 and Mariner 5 in October 1967 , they are beginning to find out what makes Venus such a grim place. * Key to the matter is a remarkable atmosphere , now thought to be about 95 percent carbon dioxide , that exerts a pressure of a hundred atmospheres ( that is , a hundred times the pressure of Earth 's atmosphere ) . Equivalent to the weight of water more than half a mile under the sea , this enormously dense atmosphere is believed to have crushed the three parachuting Soviet probes like so many eggshells when they were still 15 miles or more above the surface of Venus . LAYERS OF THICK CLOUDS above Venus reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the highest clouds seldom go above ten miles . ) They may block much of the sun 's light . In addition , molecules in the extremely dense atmosphere scatter light as does a fog . The result , according to some scientists , may be a murky twilight ; others see it as an eerie whiteout , or like living at the bottom of a dust storm or a dense smog . The thick atmosphere that weighs so oppressively on the surface tortures it in another way : It traps the sun 's energy and helps build up the most furnacelike heat vet found on any planet . At least , this is the theory held by marl . scientists , based on the well-known " greenhouse effect . " Solar energy filtering do ? through the clouds is absorbed by the surface , then re-radiated as longer-wavelengt : infrared , or heat . Much of this heat wou : : escape to space and thus cool the planet b ? . : : for the fact that the atmosphere ( like the glain a greenhouse ) effectively blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sufficient to explain the ridc ' . : e of Venus 's ultrahigh temperatures : At the equator they are observed to reach as high as 1,000 ? F. , and , because heat is transferre so efficiently by a dense atmosphere , even t poles probably are not much cooler . At suc temperatures lead , tin , and zinc will mel and any number of compounds vaporize . If you could stand on the surface of Venu few obstacles would block the view . Rece observations with the 120-foot Haystac radar telescope ( opposite ) , operated by t Massachusetts Institute of Technolog. *See " Mariner Scans a Lifeless Venus , " by Frank San well , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , May 1963. 160 National Geogral  | Lincoln Laboratory near Boston , have detected a low mountain range , but in general the surface of Venus is thought to be quite gentle in slope . Bright areas showing up on radar pictures at Haystack , and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 's Goldstone installation , are generally interpreted as local rough spots , not necessarily elevations . But of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Venus and its capacity to bend light rays sharply , just as a prism does . This refraction would make it seem that you were standing in a bowl , with the horizon turning up in every direction . In fact , the light bending is so extreme that , were it not for the low visibility , if you shone an enormously powerful light ahead of you , the light would go completely around the planet , hitting you in the back of the head . That is the whimsical suggestion of Dr. Von R. Eshleman , who has studied the way light and radio waves act in the atmosphere of Venus . Put another way , if such an atmosphere were totally transparent , you could theoretically see all the way around the planet . IN THE LATE I8TH CENTURY , Sir William Herschel , Britain 's Court Astronomer , believed that life existed on all the planets , as well as the sun . What a shock Venus would be for him today ! Although some terrestrial organisms can withstand unbelievably hostile conditions , such as salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know could live on the hot surface of Venus . Nor is water in liquid form thought to be there , and some liquid water seems to be an essential for earthly life , at least . Dr. Carl Sagan , of Cornell University , points out , however , that life on another planet would not in any case require terrestrial conditions ? that it would be adapted to its own special environment . He suggests that microscopic forms of life may exist at some level in the clouds , like plankton in Earth 's seas . At the top layer of the Venus clouds , temperatures have been measured at about - 35 ? F. , and somewhere between the frigid cloud tops and the searing surface must be a " comfortable " temperature . One of the many mysteries about Venus is where its water has gone ? if , indeed , it ever had any . Was Venus made from materials that lacked water ? Or did it outgas or exhale water in large amounts over the ages , just as has Earth , through volcanoes and fumaroles. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure is that recent observations of the planet 's infrared absorption indicate that the amount of water vapor in the upper atmosphere is extremely low ? no more than 1/1,000 the amount in Earth 's atmosphere . Controversy surrounds the question of whether water droplets or ice crystals could exist in the Venus cloud layers . It is an astonishing fact that Earth has nearly as much carbon dioxide as does Venus . even though only a small fraction of a percent is found in our atmosphere . Most of our carbon dioxide has dissolved in the oceans . where it has become locked up in calcium carbonate , such as in sea shells and limestone . If that lock were picked , Earth would have a dense carbon-dioxide atmosphere . very much like that of Venus . THE ROTATION PERIOD of Venus was tocenturies a matter of dispute . Publishe , : guesses varied from 22 hours to 365 dayBut nobody knew for sure , because the . could n't see the surface of the planet itsel : Increasingly sensitive radar observations . which pierce through the clouds , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its axis once every 243 days . To everyone 's astonishment , it turns clockwise . backward to the typical motion of the planets Because of the combination of this slow backward rotation and the 225 days it takethe planet to make one orbit around the sun . Venus " sees " the sun come up in the west every 117 earth days . One of the controversies raging most vigorously in planetary astronomy today centeron the question of what makes up the Vent : - clouds . When I posed the matter to Dr. Donal Hunten , of the Kitt Peak National Observatory , he commented wryly , " We get man : . answers to that question , which means w just do n't know . " Some specialists insist that.they find e-idence of water droplets or ice crystals ; othersee dust . Among other substances that have been suggested are compounds of mercur and a form of iron chloride which might explain the yellowish color so characteristic o : Venus . The truth , most likely , is that the Venus clouds will prove to contain a mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record information . After years of preparation and 5 ' /2 months in flight , we have only two hours to gather all the close-up information on Mercury we will get in this decade . Earth lies 93 million miles behind , still a very bright point of light . The scientists there , at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , wait tensely for the information from our instruments and tape recorders ; the signals take more than eight minutes to reach Earth . The sun , now only 43 million miles away , appears more than twice as large as when seen from Earth ; the solar radiation bombarding us is five times as intense as that striking Earth 's atmosphere . If our spacecraft were truly designed for manned flight , it would require much more radiation shielding and temperature control . The surface of Mercury filling our view is a rare sight , never clearly seen from Earth . Now we can see it with perfect clarity ; no atmospheric effects block the vista . We are only about 600 miles from the surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet across . Everywhere we see evidence that this rocky cinder has been cratered by comets and asteroids , and it is not hard to imagine that it was once scorched by tremendous heat . eteran viewer of the solar system , Dr. Gerard Kuiper has discovered two satellites of outer . anets : Miranda , a moon of Uranus , in 1948 , and eptune 's Nereid in 1949 . Director of the Lunar Ind Planetary Laboratory of the University of rizona in Tucson , he stands beside a balloonriding telescope that records ultraviolet radiation . Mercury Catapulted by Venus 's gravitational field , our spacecraft bends its flight path by some 40 degrees and races on toward Mercury , the polar system 's innermost and smallest planet . On March 30 , 1974 , we reach this second coal . Mercury has only about a third the di , nneter of Earth . We approach it so fast and it rooms so swiftly that we almost feel vertigo . Dr. Gerard Kuiper ( left ) , Director of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solar-system history , I believe , the sun blazed for a short time , maybe ten thousand years , with a luminosity as much as thirty times greater than that of today . Mercury was probably twice as massive then as it is now , but the sun evaporated away half its substance . The lighter , more volatile elements escaped , leaving a heavy planet that is probably about 30 percent silicates , or rock , and 70 percent metals . It is 5 ' /2 times as dense as water . " Even today Mercury bathes constantly in ferocious heat . When the planet is at aphelion , the farthermost point from the sun in its eccentric orbit , the flow of solar energy is five times as great as that reaching the vicinity of Earth . When Mercury comes into perihelion , its closest approach , the searing radiation is ten times as great . Temperatures reach 650 ? F. on the equator , though they probably drop during the long night to - 300 ? F.  | And there is apparently no atmosphere such as our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way Mercury reflects and polarizes light is similar to that of the airless moon . With low gravity ( only a third that of Earth ) and high temperatures , atoms and molecules of most gases would move so rapidly that , over the eons , they would escape to interplanetary space . The pictures telemetered back to Earth in the Mercury mission will arouse unprecedented interest among scientist and layman alike . Astronomers have never seen Mercury really well , even though it is reasonably close to Earth as distances go in the solar system . The planet stays so close to the sun in its relatively tiny orbit that , to the naked eye , it is  | most always swallowed up in the glare . On Earth it can sometimes be seen briefly as an evening star just after sunset , or as a morning star ( the ancients called it Apollo ) just before dawn . But Earth 's thick , haze-and-dust-filled atmosphere on the horizon often blots it out . For the same reasons that Mercury is difficult to see , it is a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates have ever been made showing markings on the surface ( opposite ) . Virtually all these were : aken at the observatory of New Mexico State University , at Las Cruces .

Noi Astronomers alma by the discovery . @# OVER THE DECADES , astronomers who patiently waited for glimpses of Mercury , and laboriously sketched the few bright and dark markings they thought they saw , were convinced that Mercury always kept the same face toward the sun . The widely held theory was that Mercury 's rotation , like the moon 's , was synchronous ? that is , the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took to orbit the sun . That period was 88 earth days . But , in 1965 , Dr. Gordon H. Pettengill , working at Cornell 's huge 1,000-foot radio reflector set in the ground at Arecibo , Puerto Rico , monitored the planet 's rotation at only about 59 days . Now there was a puzzle indeed ! Astronomers almost to a man were astonished by the discovery . 163  | Then it was noticed that 59 was almost exactly two-thirds of 88 . Could that have meaning ? It not only could but does . It means that Mercury spins three times for every two revolutions about the sun , showing astronomers nearly the same face with the same markings each successive time the planet is in the most favorable viewing position . So Mercury 's year is 88 earth days long , and its sidereal day ( as seen from the stars ) is 58.65 earth days . But its solar day ? that is , the period from one midnight or noon to the next ? is exactly twice as long as its year , 176 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strange combination of rotation and orbiting rates , with an eccentric orbit , brings about a most peculiar effect in the apparent motion of the sun over Mercury . If you were on Mercury at dawn just at perihelion passage , you would see the sun come up , hang for a brief time in the sky , drop back below the horizon , then rise again . Because of this strange phenomenon , Professor Bruce W. Hapke , of the University of Pittsburgh , calls Mercury " the Joshua planet . " He refers , of course , to the Old Testament prophet who commanded the sun to stand still over Gibeon during the battle between the Israelites and the Amorites . Could there be life on Mercury ? Conditions do not seem at all favorable , and no one seriously suggests it .

Professor Smith directs planetary programs at New Mexico State University . @# Ten days from now another Mariner exactly like ours will arrive , go into a somewhat different orbit , and for 90 days flash back to Earth findings about seasonal changes . Between these two Mariner 1971 missions , we hope to clear up some of the enigmas of Mars . BEFORE the Mariner 4 mission in 1964-65 , when all we knew of Mars had been painfully gleaned through telescopes , many people believed that Mars was much like Earth . It was the only planet , of course , whose surface we could clearly see . Its solar day lasted only about 40 minutes longer than ours . The tilt of its axis with respect to the orbit was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets much the same seasonal variations . Observations showed that Mars had a thin atmosphere . Surface temperatures , at least at midday on the equator , were comparable to air temperatures on Earth on a spring day We could clearly see polar caps like Earth's. presumably made of water ice , that waxed and waned with the seasons . The spring " wave of darkening , " which some observers discerned , suggested vegetation responding to the advance of a wave of moisture from the polar regions . And of course there were the " canals . " Ever since the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1877 described seeing many straight lines on Mars , people had persisted in construing his word canali ( channels or canalas suggesting that intelligent beings had du them . Percival Lowell , founder of the Lowe : Observatory in Arizona , pyramided Schi. : - parelli 's canali into a full-blown fantasy , intelligent beings on Mars . But the three Mariners ( one in 1964 and two in 1969 ) have demolished most , ' these notions . From close-up pictures sent back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martian surface , and from infrare , ? and ultraviolet studies , we now see a Ma-s that is quite different from Earth and , itdeed , from anything else now known in the solar system . The Martian atmosphere , chiefly carbon dioxide , measures less than 1 percent the density and pressure of Earth 's . You would have to climb more than 20 miles above the surface of Earth to find air so thin . The plan enjoys little protection against the sun 's radi tions , especially ultraviolet , that would quickly  | kill any unprotected Earth organisms . If there is any life on Mars , it clearly must have some kind of shield or filter. * It will also have to be able to endure abrupt and extreme changes in temperature . At midday on the equator , a thermometer might measure as high as 80 ? F. , but that night it could drop to 150 ? below zero .

Some scientists believe that Mars retains water in the form of permafrost , perhaps many feet under the surface . In addition , there is a very small amount of water vapor in the atmosphere . Although the thin haze that seems to hang high in the atmosphere probably consists of fine particles of frozen carbon dioxide , brightenings on the disk , chiefly in the equatorial regions , may be water-ice fog or clouds , or even surface frost . The polar caps in all probability are dry ice ? frozen carbon dioxide ? with a small amount of water ice . As they warm up in spring , they do not melt but sublime , or evaporate . It 's unlikely there is enough water in any form to support vegetation that might produce the " wave of darkening . " IN VIEW of these hostile conditions , I asked Dr. Norman H. Horowitz , Professor of Biology at Caltech , about prospects of finding life on Mars . " Mariner 's observations have certainly not improved the chances , although at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . If life does exist on Mars , it must be something very primitive , like bacteria ; the idea of substantial plants or animals is out . " A few scientists are less pessimistic . In any case , no orbiter or flyby can answer the question , only a landing vehicle . That 's why NASA hopes to send a spacecraft called Viking to Mars in 1976 , landing instruments to scoop up soil and test for life ( pages 172-3 ) . Either way the answer goes , biologists regard it as of the utmost importance in helping to understand life on Earth . " When men first land on Mars ? as they may actually do before the end of this century ? they will find rather uninteresting terrain for the most part , " suggests Professor Robert Leighton ( below ) , of the California Institute of Technology , who was in charge of the Mariner Mars television experiments . " Everything in the Mariner pictures indicates very gentle slopes on Mars . There are no mountain ranges , no great faults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of volcanic activity . You could stand in a crater on Mars and never know it ? even one that appears sharp and clear in the pictures . " Mars does indeed have highlands and lowlands . Using Lincoln Lab 's Haystack radar , Dr. Gordon Pettengill , now Director of the Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory , has found a difference of about eight miles in elevation between the highest and lowest point on the planet . But the changes in elevation are gradual and the slopes are gentle as one climbs from the lowland basins to the highest plateaus. *See " Mars : A New World to Explore , " by Carl Sagan , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , December 1967 . Man behind the Mars pictures , Dr. Robert Leighton , Professor of Physics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , had charge of the successful TV studies of Mars by Mariners 6 and 7 , as well as by Mariner 4 in 1964-5 . KODACHROME BY EMORY KRISTOF ? N.G.S.  | THREE radically different kinds of terrain show up in the Mariner pictures : cratered , " chaotic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon , craters appear prominently , even in the thin south polar cap . But in depth and slope , they vary distinctly from those of the lunar surface , suggesting differences in the geological processes that modify them . Many of the Martian craters appear as though their rims had been sandpapered off , and they show very flat bottoms . A second kind of terrain , essentially free of craters , appears in the region between Aurorae Sinus and Margaritifer Sinus . Its irregular , jumbled topography of short ridges and furrows , covering in one area as much as half a million square miles ? the size of Alaska ? has been given the name " chaotic terrain . " It somewhat resembles the debris of a terrestrial landslide , but nowhere on Earth do formations like this extend over such large regions . The bright circular " desert " of Hellas ( really 174 National Geograi  | a misnomer , since all Mars is a desert ) represents the third kind of topography of Mars . It is called featureless because in a large smooth basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen . Nothing on the moon looks like this , but it does somewhat resemble the great plains of Earth . By contrast , the dark highland region to the west , Hellespontus , is heavily cratered . Geologists scratch their heads when you ask them to explain why . What could allow meteoroids to fall on Hellespontus but protect Hellas ? Or what could erase the craters in one region and not in the other ? Professor Robert Sharp , of the Department of Geology at the California Institute of Technology , proposes the most interesting theory . He suggests that possibly Hellas is floored with some unusually light , porous material ( which he dubs " micro-popcorn " ) . The Martian winds , perhaps occasionally reaching 100-mile-an-hour velocities , could easily move this material , and craters would quickly be filled in and lost . PROFESSOR Bradford A. Smith , Director of the planet-photographing observatory at New Mexico State University ( page 168 ) , offers a plausible explanation for the evanescent lines called " canals . " " Now that we have seen the Mariner pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the classical lines are discovered to be chains of dark-floored craters , some are irregular alignments of dark patches . Most of the rest will be figments ? illusory and misinterpreted . " Two scientists at the University of Massachusetts , Dr. William T. Plummer and Robert K. Carson , report that the reflection spectrum of Mars resembles that of an uncommon substance known as carbon suboxide , a foulsmelling compound with the formula C302 . When ultraviolet radiation hits this substance , it forms polymers , or molecular chains , with an orange or reddish-brown color . Carbon suboxide , rather than iron minerals , could account for the color of Mars , the two scientists believe . This report has aroused substantial controversy . However , a comment by Dr. Leighton becomes quite pertinent : " If you 're planning to go to Mars , better take a clothespin for your nose . They tell me it smells like fermented sweat socks .

An easy assumption would be that the asteroids are the debris of a planet that exploded . But the reverse may well be true . Dr. Tom Gehrels , a long-time student of these objects at the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona , regards them as building stones of the solar system . " The asteroids are probably part of the original record of the nebula , or dust cloud , from which we believe the sun and planets condensed some five billion years ago , " he says . " Asteroids are dust that has been compacted ? accretion products ? or fragments from collisions of such bodies .

At such close encounter its half-mile-thick bulk may become red hot .

Solar cells for energy would be of marginal . se to us now : We receive only one twentyseventh the solar radiation Earth receives . So , on two long booms stretching beyond our big antenna dish , we have generators using radioactive materials to produce power to perate our electronic equipment ( above ) . Mesages to Earth , carrying pictures and information on magnetic fields , ionized particles , temperature , and planet chemistry , now take 47 minutes to travel that great distance one way . There seems no end to the enormous bulk below us .

Only when we were farther out could we view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the poles because of its high rotation rate . Irregular bands of alternate yellow and bluish or brownish gray cover the surface ? and yet perhaps one should not say surface , for all we see are clouds . No man knows at what depth , perhaps thousands of miles down , Jupiter 's enormous pressures have turned its hydrogen to a metallic solid . Two striking phenomena catch the eye : The Great Red Spot , one of the most curious objects of the entire solar system , stands out like a blemish on the southern hemisphere . Its elliptical area , seeming to float " among the clouds , is larger than Earth 's surface ( pages 148 , 176 , and 177 ) . The most likely theory yet proposed suggests that it is a kind of eddy in the atmosphere caused by a depression or a high spot far below .

Eight additional ? and smaller ? satellites give Jupiter a family larger than the sun 's . We know all too little about Jupiter ; it is a series of perplexing questions and riddles . Yet what scientists do know and what they surmise make it in many ways the most exciting , the most provocative , body in the solar system . " We regard this vast ball , so different from any of the rocky terrestrial planets , as a ' deepfreeze sample ' of the original cloud of dust and gas from which the solar system condensed , " says Dr. Tobias Owen , of the Illinois Institute of Technology Research Institute . Cold outer temperatures and high gravitational force ( two and a third times that of Earth ) have most likely prevented the primordial gases from escaping . " Moreover , " says Dr. Owen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only a tle more massive , gravitational contraction ould release so much energy that it would rn into a nuclear furnace , like the sun or v other star , and become incandescent . " Though Jupiter is no more than a " nearr , " something most unusual goes on within deep , turbulent atmosphere : The giant anet gives off substantially more energy an it receives from the sun ? two to three mes as much . No one knows why , although avitational contraction has been suggested a cause . Scientists suspect that temperares rise steadily from - 200 ? F. at the cloud ps to as much as 20,000 ? at the core . And through some mechanism not clearly derstood , the Jovian planet emits random rsts of intense radio energy at long wavengths ( page 178 ) . It is , as radio astronomers rceive it , the most powerful radio object in sky except for the sun . Apparently these fissions are tied to the planet 's powerful gnetic field and radiation belts ( regions of arged particles above the atmosphere ) , mething @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To add to the puzzle , the radiocasts are affected by the position of Io , second closest of Jupiter 's moons . Astronomers analyzing Jupiter 's upper atmosphere with spectrometers conclude that it consists largely of hydrogen and helium , a finding that explains why the planet 's density is only a fourth that of Earth 's . Pioneer F ? and Pioneer G , scheduled to go to Jupiter 13 months later ? will seek to establish the all-important proportions of hydrogen and helium . These two gases , the lightest and simplest of all chemical elements , make up 99 percent of the universe , and their ratio will help indicate whether Jupiter truly is a living fossil of the solar system . Methane and ammonia , simple compounds formed when hydrogen joins with carbon and nitrogen respectively , have also been detected .

We see Neptune dead ahead , a bluish-green sphere whose features have never been photographed from Earth . Farthest out of the giant planets , this twin of Uranus now moves nearly three billion miles from the sun . So intense is the cold that our spacecraft would drop to 370 ? below zero F. , except for the heat from our radio-isotope thermal generators . Radio time to Earth : four hours , six minutes . The data our instruments are now recording , and the pictures being sent to Earth , will add immeasurably to our understanding of Neptune and its moons , for our knowledge is meager indeed . Both Uranus and Neptune have densities greater than Jupiter and Saturn . This fact suggests that the two outer planets are not as rich in hydrogen and helium , but must contain a higher proportion of water and ammonia ices , as do comets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman , working separately , concluded that the gravitational tug of an unknown planet was forcing Uranus to wander from its predicted orbit . The location where the missing planet should be was calculated , and Neptune was found within an hour 's search . But Neptune 's pull seemingly did not fully account for the observed wanderings of Uranus . Two Americans , Percival Lowell and W. H. Pickering , insisted that still another planet would be found , and predicted its path around the sun . In 1929 , Clyde W. Tombaugh , a young astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Arizona , undertook to look for " Planet X. " I well remember the excitement stirred by his discovery of Pluto in 1930 . So I felt more than ordinary pleasure a few months ago when I talked to Professor Tombaugh , now at New Mexico State University , and heard his own account of the search . Tombaugh 's technique was to make two photographs of a section of the sky a few nights apart , then compare the images . He showed me one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an area of 14 by 17 inches . It looked as if it had been spattered with soot . Under a viewing device known as ablink comparator , he examined first one plate , then the other , in rapid succession , studying  | one small area at a time . If any object had moved against the star background in that interval of several nights , it would seem to jump . Asteroids and spurious images complicated this tedious work . But on February 18 , 1930 , after seven months ' painstaking inspection of some six million star images , Professor Tombaugh found his quarry ? a yellowish body with a magnitude of about 15 , only 1/4000 as bright as the faintest star you can see with the naked eye . It was named Pluto , and the first two letters of the name , which also are Percival Lowell 's initials , became its symbol . The outermost planet is so small and so remote that it is exceedingly difficult to measure accurately . Thus we know almost nothing about it , except that it orbits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ( known from fluctuation of its light ) , and appears to be no larger than Mars . It is thought to be solid and not made of gases . Its eccentric orbit brings it inside Neptune 's orbit near perihelion ; in fact , it comes closer to the sun than Neptune ever does . For this and other reasons , some astronomers think Pluto is actually an escaped satellite of Neptune . Following his discovery , Tombaugh continued searching for other planets . Fourteen years of work on 338 pairs of plates with 90 million star images left him exhausted but convinced : " If anyone wants to go out and look for more planets , O.K. , but he 'd better look up what is involved , " declares the man who found Pluto . Ironically , the calculations of Uranus 's deviations on which Lowell 's prediction was based have since been shown to be in error . So the discovery of the ninth planet , although the result of the most tedious systematic searching , was in reality a happy accident . ON MARCH 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that time the little planet , probably a snow-covered rock , is thirty times as far from the sun as is Earth , and the solar energy falling on each square mile is a thousandth of that for Earth . Our long voyage to the planets is ended . The Grand Tour spacecraft moves on to an endless wandering beyond the solar system and into the mazes of the Milky Way . We have traveled farther than any man before us , and have seen such wonders as no eye has ever beheld . With Immanuel Kant , the 18th-century philosopher , we may say : " I have ... ventured on a dangerous journey , and I already behold the foothills of new lands . Those who have the courage to continue the search will set foot upon them .... "
