IT seems quite shocking that white workers earn 50% more than black workers . But we are even more disturbed by the fact that the best paid fifth of all white workers earns 600% more than the worst paid fifth . From this viewpoint , racial inequality looks almost insignificant . <P> Poverty is not primarily hereditary . While children born into poverty have a higher than average chance of ending up poor , there is still an enormous amount of economic mobility from one generation to the next . Indeed , there is nearly as much economic inequality among brothers raised in the same homes as in the general population . This means that inequality is re-created anew in each generation , even among people who start life in essentially identical circumstances . <P> There is almost as much economic inequality among those who score high on standardized tests as in the general population . <P> All school surveys show that children with affluent parents want more education than children with poor parents , even when we compare individuals with the same test scores and grades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> If tracking placing slow learners in slow classes , fast learners in fast affects test scores at all , the effect is too small to be pedagogically significant ... Nobody knows when tracking will produce one effect and when it will produce another . <P> If America were suddenly to create a system in which new recruits to the upper middle class were selected entirely on the basis of test scores , one upper-middle-class child in three would be able to maintain his or her parents ' privileges ... The idea that tests serve mainly to maintain the privileges of the economic elite is exaggerated . <P> If people do not want to attend school or college , an egalitarian society ought to accept this as a legitimate decision and give these people subsidized job training , subsidized housing , or perhaps simply a lower tax rate .
