Once it seemed like an imaginative new way to overcome the faults of inferior schools . Instead of relying on standard teachers and standard routines , a community could sign a contract with outside specialists who would be paid only if they improved the students ' learning . More than 30 cities have experimented with " performance contracting , " and one poll showed that two-thirds of the nation 's school-board members were interested in trying it ( TIME , Oct. 11 ) . <P> The Office of Economic Opportunity decided to organize a major study of performance contracting during the 1970-71 school year . It authorized up to $7.2 million for the project , spread among six educational firms and conducted in 18 school districts in both big cities and rural areas . The subjects of the year-long experiment were 13,000 children in grades one to three and seven to nine . <P> Last week , OEO announced the results of the test-a failure . " The overall differences are so slight , " said OEO , " that we can conclude performance contracting was no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of instruction . " OEO stressed that the findings do not mean that the idea is necessarily wrong , but it added that " an uncritical rush to embrace the concept is unwarranted at this time . " <P> Post-mortems thus far indicate that contractors may indeed have relied too much on computerized teaching machines and programmed reading materials . Cracked David Selden , president of the American Federation of Teachers : " Now the OEO should stick to the poverty business and leave education to teachers . " <P> The trouble with that argument is that teachers are not doing much of a job either . According to the OEO survey , all student-achievement averages , both in the special classrooms and in a control group of ordinary classes , failed to reach the national norms .
