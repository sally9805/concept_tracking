10 Mar . Apr. ' 73 Genius is no snob . Once upon a time an illegitimate son was born to Ser Piero and Caterina , Donna d'Acchattabrigha di Piero del Vacca , in a humble but under the south side of the cliff of the castle of Vinci , facing to the Italian east . The event was so unnoticed that even its date , 1452 , is not quite certain . But the time would come when the boy , grown to manhood , would call on the home of a nobleman in Rome and , finding him out , would merely inscribe with a piece of chalk on the front door in a single magnificent flourish a perfectly formed circle  --  for did not all the world know that such incredible skill could only belong to the greatest artist of the Renaissance , perhaps the greatest of all time , Leonardo da Vinci ? Supremacy was his calling card . A lifetime ago , genius again touched the head of a tiny girl in a farmhouse in upstate New York , as she peeked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day Grandma Moses would be acclaimed for the primitive poetry she brought to a painting of that scene . Not quite so long ago , a tousle-haired choirboy in the handcarved stalls of the towering Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan made sure that no one saw while he doodled in the margins of his hymnbook during the sermon . Today , bidders in the most exalted art salons fall over each other to possess the tiniest sketch with the signature , " Norman Rockwell . " And now , right now , in the very center of the map of America ( give or take a few splinters on your ruler ) is the state of Illinois . Smack in the middle of Illinois is a tiny town , and in the depth of its quiet residential streets , right in the middle of the block , is a yellow brick house . And , in the heart of that family residence , downstairs a boy labors over his easel every day from 5 a.m. to suppertime in a converted coal bin his grandfather built before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio , hardly big enough to swing a cat in , in Mark Twain 's phrase . But it is large enough . Large enough for genius to squeeze in again and steady those young hands . For they belong to a lad you can see in his self-portrait on the cover of this magazine . Norman Rockwell him- self , who has appraised the work of Robert Charles Howe with a characteristic intensity and largeness of spirit , says that Bob " is better than 1 was at eighteen . " If you will , stop for a second and open your heart to what this really means . The master 's works are on tour all over the United States and our greatest museums have had their placid routines joggled and their turnstiles twirled , as unheard-of throngs came to gaze at the paintings of Norman Rockwell . The man who sees things very much with their own eyes , had they only the gift which is his  --  to look where the small , wonderful things of life are hiding , and then to put it forever on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generosity , with an arm across the shoulders of this unknown young student/art ist . Set your fears aside . The American dream still lives , and is in good hands , let cynics say what they will . We shall never know , realty , where to look for genius . But rest assured , it will always be there , in the secret places which are part of God 's plan . Our own faith may have faltered a little at the beginning , when SatEvePost started the Norman Rockwell Cover Contest . We wrote : " Who knows where another such promise may be hidden , waiting to be found ? . . . Who knows where genius lies ? We only know for sure that it is there , somewhere out there . And we aim to find it . " Then the paintings , the sketches . the charcoals , began to flood in . We could see that some were quite good , some merely competent , others merely an indication that art , no matter how diligently pursued , isnot for everyone . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Howe . Could the family drive down to our Indianapolis office and submit his work in the competition ? We swallowed hard and said yes , of course ( one of the burdens of this business is the constant necessity to find a gentle way to turn aside hope , leaving just enough so that , in case we were wrong , all chance of success might not be extinguished ) . So the lad you see here walked in with his father , George . Bob is precisely as he paints himself . He 's medium size . The hair is red , very red in certain lights . He 's quiet , but he 's easy to talk to . There 's plenty of boy still left there : the man is emerging . He had a number of his sketches and paintings with him , and as he and his father began to unwrap them , we hoped against hope that it would n't be too hard to respond . The two of them were all eagerness , close to shaking , but it must be confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they put out for inspection what you can see here . The self portrait in the mirror ? " Holy Cow ! Look , mom , making like Norman Rockwell ! " The beautifully fashioned painting of his father as the eternal salesman  --  shabby , almost defeated but not quite , gamely coming up with just one more stale joke that might clinch the deal . And there stood his father in person , a well-groomed and confident industrial designer . The likeness was perfect , but the young artist had gone beyond copying the outer image and had added his own inner dimension to the figure . Like Rockwell . Like Rockwell ? ? ! ! Next we saw the painting of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew in the familiar mood of the Rockwell painting on the U.N . theme . And there , in the background , Bob Howe had painted in himself as one of the component figures . Just like Rockwell . Like Rockwell ? ? ! ! There was a caricature of Norman Rockwell , similar to the one Rockwell had done of himself .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginnings of a sketch of the street on which Bob lives , Rockwellian in mood , and reminiscent of the hundreds of little streets which have appeared in Post covers and illustrations  --  real streets and real people , captured in a moment of time , for all time . Everybody talked at once . We ca n't expect you to believe this , but you should , because it is the literal truth . Bob is largely self-taught . He has had only a year of formal training , and that was in the art classes of St. Xavier College , near his home . Great credit must go to those teachers . They knew what they had , and they moulded him wisely without changing him . Art students today are often eager for modern modes and techniques . Here was a lad who had opted for the disciplines and representational techniques of the old masters , but especially of Norman Rockwell . There are those in art circles who are jealous enough of Rockwell 's great commercial success to try and deny him the palm of true art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught him , as he says , that " thinking is an important part of painting . " They taught him to read deeply into the history of art , to study the work of the masters . They taught him to study anatomy , and today he is seldom far from his book of complicated drawings of bones , muscles , and the human form . But that was for just a year . What about the rest ? Bob tells it himself . " When I was in first grade , I remember that while the other kids were doing stick figures I was sketching them . " He drew everything . But from the beginning Norman Rockwell was his idol . Bob 's grandfather , the late George Dillon , was a Rockwell fan , and he often summoned the little boy to pore over the pages of the Post for the Rockwell laughter and tears . It was a kind of an art class in itself . And when Bob started to draw the world around him , Grandpa never let the boy take it either too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Michelangelo . The big day in Bob 's life came during a visit with his troop of boy scouts to the Chicago Museum of Art . He knows every painting there  --  the Vermeers , the Van Goghs , the Rembrandts  --  but Bob thinks for himself , and he had already decided years ago that Rockwell has it all . In modelling himself after Rockwell , he was going for the top . Bob is first an artist , but he is a rugged kid besides . Up in his bedroom , otherwise as austere as a monk 's cell , he has three Rockwells on the walls , but next to his bed is a little shelf on which there are three baseball trophies he won in the Little League as a catcher who hit more home runs than anyone else , and who almost made it to the Little League World Series . He can handle himself . So he bought the big hook for himself . It lies now close to the shelf outside his studio where he keeps his other treasures  --  books of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sport , his social life , his life itself . " I do n't mind being a loner , " says Bob . " I even like cloudy days . Maybe because I 'm not tempted to go out , away from my studio . " His light comes from inside . He has help . Bob 's mother and father , Jean and George Howe , have never wavered in their conviction that their youngest son has a special gift . There are two older Howe boys , out in the world on their own now , who are making their way by conventional careers . But the parents discerned at an early date the special attributes of their youngster , and although it is often the way of parents to sacrifice their own comforts and luxuries for the sake of their children , the Howes have managed to do this and more  --  since Bob , who is indeed something special , obviously does n't think he is . He has been brought up wisely , ready to use his great talents , with an understanding of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day , the Howes bundled into the family car and headed for Stockbridge , Massachusetts , the home of Norman Rockwell . They were inspired by Rockwell 's response to a painting Bob Howe had sent him late in November of the previous year . This was the caricature of Rockwell , adapted closely from Rockwell 's own  --  one boy scout to another . Bob had mailed it himself , but when no word came , he concluded that he was getting just what he deserved from the . famous man . Indifference . But . . . on Christmas Eve , as the boy went up the stairs to his room , there was a package on the step at the top . It was the little painting , returned : and on it Rockwell had written , " Very well done , " and signed it . There 'll never be a Christmas like that again in Bob Howe 's life , not quite . So off they went to Stockbridge . Norman Rockwell is a very private person , and he works every day . But all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must parcel out the time he has for others or they will consume him , with so much painting to do , still ahead of him . Rockwell did , of course , consent to say hello to the boy who had sent him the caricature , but only for a moment . Bob confesses to a small bit of diplomacy in asking for the audience . He knew that Rockwell admires Rembrandt above all . So Bob wrote saying that " perhaps if you had the chance to be with Rembrandt in person , you can understand how I feel about asking to visit you . " Not bad for an eighteen-year-old . Bob does not merely copy Rockwell . He idolizes him , as we know , and he has patterned his style after Rockwell . However , " I rank Rockwell as our greatest painter . But I try to learn a little from everybody . I love the Impressionists , but then again I love the Flemish painters too and the Dutch , and I try in some way to put them universally together . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woman in The Red Gown , the little diamonds , the highlights . I want to portray everything as closely as I can to real life , but not to the point where it 's mechanically done . I want to give it a personal feeling . I do n't want to he Mr. Rockwell , I want to be me . I love the scenes he has portrayed , the type of things he has done , and I sincerely feel that I would like to follow him in portraying the American scene  --  if possible , as well as he did , but in my own way , for my own time . To see reality with the artist 's eye . Reality by itself may not be interesting enough to portray , but then you must move something into it , or trigger some emotion . " When Rockwell saw the boy 's paintings , the careful time schedule went out the window . The master and the student talked about things only they could feel . Rockwell is a restrained kind of person , but when George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob , Norman consented , and they posed as you see them with this article , in the center of the great man 's studio . Bob shyly admits that he put an answering arm around the older man , which does n't show in the picture . " He was hard and muscular , " says Bob . The pupil who came to touch the master also found a man . So now the young student is also a man . Nineteen today , he will have the family garage converted into a new studio . His box of pipes ( does n't Norman Rockwell smoke a pipe ? ) , his library of old masters , and his skeleton and the books on anatomy will all go along , to be at his elbow while he forgets everything else at the easel . The coal bin is no more . But that is where it all started , where " Mick " pursued his particular Rockwellian star . Where did this American dream start ? Who can Nay ? His father pretends to no great artistic talent . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packing business , and Grandmother likes music and an occasional Highland fling . But there may be a hint in this  --  the " Howe , " according to George , suffered Anglo-Saxon mutations in England , and can be traced back , if you go far // enough , to a German forebear who was celebrated in his day for the beauty and delicacy of his woodcarving . That fine discipline may have found its way into Bob 's hands , perhaps . No matter . They are there . and they can paint , and that is what matters now . And what of the future ? Well , it began to shape up for Bob Howe when Norman Rockwell graciously consented to judge the entrant paintings in the contest named in his honor , and we journeyed to Stockbridge with a passel of art for his inspection . If you have ever attempted to transport valuable paintings via air , you will understand the dilemma we faced-the tender mercies of airline baggage departments are too well known to seasoned travelers for us to conceive of committing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they may be with more sturdy cargo . So it was necessary to work out a way of carrying them . But airlines do not permit luggage aboard larger than will fit under the passenger 's seat . And we had some biggies . Then came the inspiration . Airlines will permit a passenger to carry with him a garment bag which the stewardess usually manages to stow away in a compartment built for the purpose . The inspiration : pack the paintings in garment bagg . Well , we managed to fill up a couple of them to the brim , and stoked up our courage to get them aboard . While the Lady Editor diverted the attention of the stewardesses and officials with naive questions concerning whether the wings would stay on the aircraft or not , the Mr. Editor moved swiftly up the aisles , bearing the heavy and rigid bags . It must be confessed that once or twice in his headlong flight he bumped into other passengers , so if you hear any rumors to the effect that a couple of people are traveling by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the message-it was us . There were four points at which the deception might have been detected , but thanks to the duplicity of the Lady Editor and the muscle of the Mr. Editor , the paintings made it all the way , and the people who were bumped by the garment bags will never be the same again . Once we were in Stockbridge , Norman Rockwell - who does everything with characteristic care and thoroughness-wanted to view the competing paintings in the proper light , so they were taken over to his studio promptly . The light was just right , and the great painter examined these hopefuls with all the seriousness he might lend to a scrutiny of a new addition to the Louvre . His decisions were positive . Bob Howe'swork won hands down . Rockwell stated flatly that he was way out ahead of others . But the judge was interested in the work of all . The second-place winner , by Gene L. Boyer , caused him to remark on the texture and treatment of the leaves , as reminiscent of Wyeth . But Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not have envisioned in his wildest dreams . His self-portrait-appears on the cover of this issue of the Post , and now he is under contract to the magazine as one of its cherished illustrators and cover artists , so that his career is actively launched and you will be seeing his work again in the future . He is also wading into a highly challenging project-a contemporary version of that famous graphic concept of American masculinity , The Arrow Collar Man . This is the image which in one case reflected the swooned-over profile of John Barrymore , and adorned the bedroom mirrors of millions of sighing damsels in a more serene age . But it also has its particular challenge artistically to Bob Howe , since it was the creation of that fine artist , J. C. Leyendecker , who in turn was the idol of Norman Rockwell . And so now it is only chronologically appropriate that the baton and the brush should be passed on to Bob for him to have a try at that classic profile . His 1973 Arrow Shirt Man ( the detachable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Pine Tree Soap ) is scheduled for a debut in our very next issue . Norman Rockwell views the cycle beginning again , reminiscent of his own career , and remarks that while he wishes the young artist well , the boy will succeed very much on the strength of his own talents . Time will show their emerging forms . One thing is sure-his inspiration will not flag , and his growth has already commenced . There will be trials . but Bob will meet them . Bob Howe has quiet wells deep in him where the real answer lies . When he first decided he was painting well enough to actually merit signing a canvas , he did so with his full name , Robert Charles Howe , the " Charles " being in there for : r favorite uncle who had died young . Since signing canvases might well become a lifelong habit , George asked if he had thought over the matter of signing his entire name . " Yes , " said Bob . " I thought that if things worked out for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more , after all . " So , Uncle Charles , there you are on the cover of The . Saturday Evening Post . And the chances are , you 're going to be there again . rt
