the night ; it would surely have been much more comfortable than this . No , he knew why he had to go . He might never have left the island after that night . Not as his own man . And if he had , Sabrina would never have forgiven him . The very fact that such a night tempted him in retrospect  --  and not merely for the comfort of sleep  --  meant that it was not a night he could have afforded . He reminded himself of that several times before he shivered himself to sleep . Then he dreamed of a diamond-crystal palace , woke with mixed emotions , and had to shiver his way to sleep again . Turning down temptation certainly was n't much pleasure when alone on the open trail . Tomorrow he would search diligently for a blanket tree and some hotsoup gourds . On the third morning of his south-chasm leg , he trekked along a ridge , his only feasible route westward . He had cut himself a new staff , after several tries ; the first saplings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assorted types . He had no doubt there were many suitable trees he never saw at all , because of their passive " do not notice me " spells . One used aphysical repulsion charm directed at cutting objects ; ev- ery time he slashed at it , his knife veered away . About an hour on the way with his new staff , he was still pondering the natural selectivity of magic . The plants with the most effective spells survived best , so became more common , but how many times did stray travelers come by here with knives ? Then he realized that he might make good use of that repulsion spell . Ifhe succeeded in cutting a staff from such a tree , would it repel all attacks against him ? Obviously this magicwas for defense against the depredations of dragons beavers , and such , not actual knives , and he would cer- tainly feel safer with an anti-dragon staff . No ; cutting the tree would kill it , and its magic would abate . Butmaybe a seed from itNo sense consuming time going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . All he had to do wasp103attempt to cut a new staff and note which tree repulsed his knife . He might be able to dig up a small one and take it entire , keeping it alive and effective . He moved down the side of the ridge , testing trees . This proved to be more hazardous than anticipated ; the knife 's approach toward their tender bark brought out the worst in them . One dropped hard fruit on him , barely missing his head ; another exhaled sleep perfume that almost stopped his journey right there . But no cutting-aversion spells , now . One large tree had a dryad , an inhabiting wood nymph , who looked very fetching , about like Iris at fourteen , but who cursed Bink roundly in most unladylikelanguage . " If you want to carve defenseless things , go carve your own kind ! " she screamed . " Go carve the mounded soldier in the ditch , you son of a  --  " Fortunatelyshe balked at completing the rhyme . Dryads were not supposed to know such language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully . Sure enough , there lay a man in militaryapparel , blood crusted on his back , groaning piteously . " Peace , " Bink said . " I will help you , if you permit . " Xanth had once needed a real army , but now the soldierswere mostly messengers for the King . Still , their costumes and pride remained . " Help me ! " the man exclaimed weakly . " I will rewardyou  --  somehow . " Now Bink felt it safe to approach . The soldier was severely wounded and had lost much blood . He was burning with the fever of infection . " I ca n't do anything for you myself ; I 'm no doctor , and if I even move you , you may expire . I will return with medication , " Bink said . " I must borrow your sword . " If the soldier gave up his sword , he was really sick . " Return soon  --  or not at all , " the man gasped , raisingthe hilt . Bink took the heavy weapon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dryad . " I needp104magic , " he told her . " Blood restoration , wound healing , fever abatement  --  that sort of thing . Tell me where I can get them , quickly , or I will chop your tree down . " " You would n't ! " she cried , horrified . Bink hefted the sword menacingly . At this moment he reminded himself of Jama , the village sword conjurer ; the image disgusted him . " I 'll tell ! I 'll tell ! " she screamed . " Okay . Tell . " He was relieved ; he doubted that he could actually have made himself chop down her tree . That would have killed her , and to no real purpose . Dryads were harmless creatures , pretty to look at ; there was no point in molesting them or their cherished tree homes . " Three miles to the west . The Spring of Life . Its waterwill cure anything . " Bink hesitated . " There is something you 're not telling me , " he said , hefting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I may not reveal it , " she cried . " Anyone who tells  --  the curse  --  " Bink made as if to chop at the trunk of the tree . The dryad screamed with such utter misery that he abated the effort . He had fought to protect Justin Tree back at home ; he could not ravage this one . " All right . I 'll risk the curse , " he said . He set off westward . He found a path leading his way . It was not an invitingone , merely an animal run , so he felt justified in using it with caution . It seemed others knew the route to the Spring . Yet as he approached , he became increasinglynervous . What was the catch , and what was the curse ? He really ought to know before he either risked himself or gave the water to the ailing soldier . Xanth was the land of magic  --  but magic had its rules , and its qualifications . It was dangerous to play with magic unless the precise nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal the soldier , it was a most strongly enchanted Spring . For that sort of aid , there had to be a price.  |p105He  found the Spring . It was in a depression , under a giant spreading acorn tree . The tree 's health augured well for the water ; it could hardly be poisoned . But there could be some other menace associated with it . Suppose a river monster were hiding in it , using the wateras a lure for the unwary ? Injured or dying creatures would be easy prey . A false reputation for healing would attract them from many miles around . Bink did n't have time to wait and watch . He had to help the soldier now or it would be too late . So this was a risk he simply had to take . He moved cautiously to the Spring . It looked cool and clear . He dipped his canteen into it , keeping his other hand on the sword . But nothing happened ; no grim tentacle rose from the depths to challenge him . Viewing the filled canteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not poisoned , it was not necessarilycurative . What use to take it to the soldier , if it would n't do the job ? There was one way to find out . He was thirsty anyway . Bink put the canteen to his mouth and sipped . The water was chill and good . He drank more deeply , and found it supremely refreshing . It certainly was n't poisoned . He dipped the canteen again and watched the bubblesrise . They distorted the view of his left hand under the water , making it seem as if he had all his fingers . He did not think much about the digit he had lost in childhood , but such a view of a supposedly complete hand teased him unpleasantly . He lifted out the canteen  --  and almost dropped it . His finger was whole ! It really was ! The childhood injuryhad been eliminated . He flexed it and touched it , amazed . He pinched it and it hurt . No question : his finger was real . The Spring really was magic . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly , it could heal anything !  |p106How  about a cold ? Bink sniffed  --  and discovered that his nose was clear . It had cured his sniffles , too . No question about it : he could recommend this Spring of Life . A true description for a potent magic . If this Spring were a person , it would be a full Magician . Again Bink 's natural caution came into play . He still did not know the nature of the catch  --  or of the curse . Why could no one tell the secret of this Spring ? What was the secret ? Obviously not the fact of its healing properties ; the dryad had told him that , and he could tell it to others . The curse could not be a river monster , for none had struck . Now that Bink was whole and well , he would be much better able to defend himself . Scratch one theory . But this did not mean there was no danger . It merely meant the threat was more subtle than he had thought . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who fled from the obvious menace of a flaming dragon could succumb to the hidden menace of the peace spell of the pines . The soldier was dying . Moments were precious , yet Bink delayed . He had to ferret this out , lest he put both the soldier and himself in greater peril than before . It was said that a person should not look a gift unicorn in the mouth , lest it prove to be enchanted , but Bink alwayslooked . He kneeled before the Spring and stared deep into it . Looking it in the mouth , as it were . " 0 Spring of Life , " he murmured . " I come on a mission of mercy , seeking no profit for myself , though I have indeed benefited . I conjure you to reveal your rationale , lest I inadvertently trespass . " He had little confidence in this formal invocation , since he had no magic with which to enforce it , but it was all he could think of . He just could n't accept such a wonderful gift without trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a price . Something swirled deep in the Spring . Bink felt the potent magic of it . It was as if he peered through a hole into another world . Oh , yes  --  this Spring had its ownp107consciousness and pride ! The field of its animus rose up to encompass him , and his consciousness plunged through the depths , bringing comprehension . Who imbibesof me may not act against my interest , on pain of forfeiture of all that I bring him . Uh-oh . This was a self-preservation spell , plain and simple . But enormously complicated in its execution . Who defined what was or was not contrary to the interests of the Spring ? Who but the Spring itself ? There would obviously be no lumbering in this region , for cuttingtrees could damage the environment and change the climate , affecting rainfall . No mining , for that could lower the water table and pollute the Spring . Even the prohibition against revealing the rationale made sense , for people with minor injuries and complaints might not use the magic water if they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't . But any actionhad extending if diminishing consequences , like the ripples of a stone dropped in a pool . In time such ripplescould cover the whole ocean . Or the whole of Xanth , in this case . Suppose the Spring decided that its interest was threatened indirectly by some action of the distant King of Xanth , such as levying a tax on lumber that caused the lumbermen to cut more wood in order to pay it . ' Would the Spring force all its users to oppose the King , perhaps assassinating him ? A person who owed his life to the Spring might very well do it . It was theoretically possible for this magic Spring to change the whole society of Xanth  --  even to become its de facto ruler . But the interests of one isolated Spring were not necessarily the interests of the human society . Probably the magic of the Spring could not extend to such extremes , for it would have to be as strong as the massed powers of all the other entities of Xanth . But slowly , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this an ethical question . " I can not accept your covenant , " Bink said into the deep swirl . " I hold no animosity toward you , but I can/not pledge to act only in your interest . The interest of the whole of Xanth is paramount . Take back your benefits ; I go my own way . " Now there was anger in the Spring . The unfathomabledepths of it roiled . The field of magic rose up again , enveloping him . He would suffer the consequence of his temerity . But it faded like a dissipating storm , leaving him . . whole . His finger remained healed , and his cold was still cured . He had called the Spring 's bluff  --  and won . Or had he ? Maybe his benefits would not be revoked until he acted specifically against the interest of the Spring . Well , his benefits were minor ; he could afford the penalty . He certainly would not be , deterred from doing what he felt was right by fear of that consequence . Bink stood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strap of the canteen over his shoulder . He turned . A chimera was crawling toward him . Bink whipped his sword around , though he was hardly expert in its use . Chimeras were dangerous ! But in a moment he saw that the creature was in dire straits . The tongue was hanging out of its lion 's head , its goat 's head was unconscious , and the snake 's head at the end of the tail was dragging on the ground . The creature was scraping along on its stomach toward the Spring , trailing blood . Bink stood aside and let it pass . He held no malice even for a chimera in this state . He had never before seen a living creature suffering like this . Except the soldier . The chimera reached the water and plunged its lion head in , drinking desperately . The change was immediate . The goat 's head snapped erect and awake , swiveling from its neck in the middle of the back to glare at Bink . The snake head hissed . No doubt about it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous , for this class of monster hated all things human . It took a step toward Bink , who held his sword tightly before him with both hands ,  |p109knowing  that flight would be futile . If he wounded it , he might escape before it dragged itself back to the Spring for a second restoration . But abruptly the thing turned away , without attacking . Bink sighed with relief ; he had put up a front , but the last thing he wanted to do was to engage in combat with such a monster , in the presence of an unfriendly Spring . There must be a general truce in this vicinity , Bink realized . It was contrary to the interest of the Spring to have predators lurk here , so no hunting or fighting was permitted . Lucky for him ! He scrambled up the slope and headed east . He hoped the soldier had survived . The soldier had . He was tough , as soldiers tended to be ; he refused to gasp out his last until nature ripped it from him . Bink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some over the wound . Suddenly the man was well . " What did you do ? " he cried . " It is as if I never got stabbed in the back . " They walked up the hill together . " I fetched water from a magic Spring , " Bink explained . He paused at the dryad 's tree . " This accommodating nymph very kindly directed me to it . " " Why , thank you , nymph , " the soldier said . " Any favorI can do in return  --  " " Just move on , " she said tightly , eyeing the sword in Bink 's hands . They moved on . " You ca n't act contrary to the interestof that Spring , " Bink said . " Or tell anyone , about the price you paid for its help . If you do , you 'll be right back where you started . I figured the price was worth it , for you . " " I 'll say ! I was doing patrol duty , guarding a patch of the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink of this elixir and the King 's eyes would be perfect without those ferns , would n't they ? I should take  --  " He broke off.  | " I can show you where the Spring is , " Bink offered . " Anybody can use it , as far as I know . " " No , it 's not that . I just suddenly got the feeling  --  I do n't think the King ought to have this water . " This simple comment had a profound impact on Bink . Did it confirm his reasoning , that the Spring 's influenceextended widely and selfishly ? Revived health of the King might not be in the interest of the Spring , soBut , , on the other hand , if the King were cured by Spring water , then the King himself would serve the Spring 's interest . Why should the Spring object to that ? Also , why had Bink himself not suffered the loss of his finger and restoration of his cold when he told the secret to the soldier ? He had defied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere bluff ? The soldier extended his hand . " I 'm Crombie . CorporalCrombie . You saved my life . How can I repay you ? " " Oh , I just did what was right , " Bink said . " I could n't just let you die . I 'm on my way to the Magician Humfrey , to see if I have any magic talent . " Crombie put his hand to his beard , pondering . He was rather handsome in that pose . " I can tell you the direction . " He closed his eyes , put out his right hand , and slowly rotated . When his pointing finger stabilized , he opened his eyes . " Magician 's that way . That 's my talent  --  direction . I can tell you where anything is . " " I already know the direction , " Bink said . " West . My main problem is getting through all this jungle . There 's so much hostile magic  --  " " You said it , " Crombie agreed heartily . " Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The raiders must have magicked me here , figuring I 'd never get out alive and my body would never be found . My shade could n't avenge me in the deep jungle . " " Oh , I do n't know about that , " Bink said , thinking of the shade Donald in the chasm . " But now I 've recovered , thanks to you . Tell youp111what : I 'll be your bodyguard until you reach the Magician . Is that a fair return ? " " You really do n't need to  --  " " Oh , but I do ! Soldier 's honor . You did me a good turn , I 'll do you a good turn . I insist . I can help a lot . I 'll show you . " He closed his eyes again , extended his hand , and rotated . When he stopped , he continued : " That 's the direction of the greatest threat to your welfare . Want to verify it ? " " No , " Bink said . " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to go out and conquer it . Give me back my sword . " Bink gave it back , and Crombie proceeded in the direction he had pointed : north . Bink followed , disgruntled . He did not want to seek out danger , but he knew it was not right to let the soldierwalk into it in his stead . Maybe it was something obvious , like the Gap dragon . But that was no immediatethreat , so long as Bink stayed out of the chasm . He fully intended to stay out . When Crombie found himself balked by thick brush , he simply slashed it away with his sword . Bink noticed that some of the vegetation gave way before the blade actually struck ; if providing a path was the best route to survival , these plants took it . But suppose the soldier hacked into a tangle tree ? That could be the danger he had pointed . out . No  --  a tangler was deadly to the unwary , but it did not move from the place it had rooted . Since Bink had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much of a threat to him unless it was west . There was a scream . Bink jumped , and Crombie held his sword at the ready . But it was only a woman , cringingand frightened . " Speak , girl ! " Crombie roared , flourishing his wicked blade . " What mischief do you intend ? " " Do n't hurt me ! " she cried . " I am only Dee , lost and alone . I thought you came to rescue me. "  | " You lie ! " Crombie exclaimed . " You mean harm to this man , my friend who saved my life . Confess ! " And he lifted his sword again . " For God 's sake  --  let her be ! " Bink yelled . " You made a mistake . She 's obviously harmless . " " My talent 's never been wrong before , " Crombiesaid . " This is where it pointed your greatest threat . " " Maybe the threat is behind her , beyond , " Bink said . " She was merely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could be . I never thought of that . " He was evidently a reasonable man , under the violence . " Wait , I 'll verify . " The soldier withdrew somewhat , stationing himself to the east of the girl . He shut his eyes and rotated . His pointing finger came to bear squarely on Dee . The girl burst into tears . " I mean you no harm  --  I swear it . Do n't hurt me ! " She was a plain girl , of strictly average face and figure , no beauty . This was in contrast to the several femalesBink had encountered recently . Yet there was something vaguely familiar about her , and Bink was alwaysunnerved by feminine distress . " Maybe it 's not physical danger , " he said . " Does your talent differen-tiate ? " " No , it does n't , " Crombie admitted , a bit defensively . " It can be any kind of threat , and she may not actually mean you harm  --  but sure as hell , there 's something . " Bink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That familiarity  --  where had he seen her before ? She was not from the North Village , and he really had not encountered many girls elsewhere . Somewhere on his current journey ? Slowly the notion dawned on him : a Sorceress of illusiondid not have to make herself beautiful . If she wanted to keep track of him , she could adopt a completelydifferent appearance , thinking he would never suspect . Yet the illusion would be easiest to maintain if it corresponded somewhat to her natural contours . Take off a few pounds here and there , modify the voice  --   |p113could  be . If he fell for the ruse , he could be in dire danger of being led into corruption . Only the soldier 's special magic gave it away . But how could he be sure ? Even if Dee represented some critical threat to him , he had to be sure he had identified the right danger . A man who stepped around a venom mouse could be overlooking a harpy on the other side . Snap judgments about magic were suspect . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be thirsty , " he said . " Have a drink of water . " And he profferedhis canteen . " Oh , thank you , " she said , taking it gladly . The water cured all ills . An enchantment was an ill , was n't it ? So if she drank , it might show her  --  at least momentarily  --  in her true guise . Then he would know . Dee drank deeply . There was no change . " Oh , this is very good , " she said . " I feel so much better . " The two men exchanged glances . Scratch one bright notion . Either Dee was not Iris , or the Sorceress had better control than he had supposed . He had no way of knowing . " Now be on your way , girl , " Crombie said curtly . " I am going to see the Magician Humfrey , " she said contritely . " I need a spell to make me well . " Again Bink and Crombie exchanged glances . Dee had drunk the magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to see the . Good Magician on that score . She had to be lying . And if she were lying , what was she concealing from them ? She must have picked this particular destination because she knew Bink was going there . Yet this was still conjecture . It could be pure coincidence  --  or she could be an ogre in female form  --  a healthy ogre !  --  waiting for the expedient moment to strike . Crombie , seeing Bink 's indecision , made a decision of his own . " If you let her go with you , then I 'm comingp114too . With my hand ever on my sword . Watching her  --  all the time . " " Maybe that 's best , " Bink agreed reluctantly . " I bear you no malice , " Dee protested . " I would do nothing to hurt you , even were I able . Why do n't you believe me ? " Bink found it too complicated to explain . " You can travel with us if you want to , " he said . Dee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingered the hilt of his sword . Crombie remained suspicious , but Bink soon discoveredhe enjoyed Dee 's company . She had no trace of the personality of the Sorceress . She was such an average gin that he identified with her to a considerable extent . She seemed to have no magic ; at least , she evaded that subject . Perhaps she was going to the Magician in the hope of finding her talent ; maybe that was what she had meant by needing a spell to make her well . Who was in good shape in Xanth without magic ? However , if she were the Sorceress Iris , her ruse would quickly be exposed by the divination of the Magician . So the truth would be known . - They stopped at the Spring of Life to refill their canteens , traveled half a day , then got caught by a technicolorhailstorm . It was magic , of course , or magicaugmented . The colors gave it away . Which meant that there would not be any great melting or runoff . All they had to do was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be on a barren ridge : no trees for miles around , no caves , no houses . The land went up and down , cut away by erosion gullies , strewn with boulders  --  but there was nothing to shield them effectivelyfrom the storm . Pelted by increasingly large hailstones , the three scurriedin the direction Crombie 's magic pointed : the route to safe shelter . It came into view behind a boulder : a monstrously spreading tentacular tree . " That 's a tangier ! " Bink exclaimed in horror . " We ca n't go there . "  |p115Crombie  was brought up short , peering through the hail . " So it is . My talent never pointed wrong before . " Except when it accused Dee , Bink thought . He wonderedjust how reliable the soldier 's magic really was . For one thing , why had n't it pointed out the soldier 's danger to himself , before he got stabbed in the back and left to die ? But Bink did not say that out loud . There were often complexities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " There 's a hephalumph there , " Dee cried . " Half eaten . " Sure enough , the huge carcass lay near the trunk orificeof the tree . Its posterior was gone , but the front end was untouched . The tree had evidently caught it and consumed as much as it could  --  but a hephalumph was so big that even a tangle tree could not polish it off in one meal . Now the tree was sated , its tentacles dangling listlessly . " So it 's safe after all , " Bink said , wincing as an eggsizedred hailstone just missed his head . The hail was puffy and light , but it still could hurt . " It will be hours before the tree revives enough to become aggressive . Maybe even days  --  and even then , it 'll start on the lumph first . " Still Crombie balked , understandably . " Could be an illusion , that carcass , " he warned . " Be suspicious of all things  --  that 's the soldier 's motto . A trap to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think it tempted the hephalumph in there ? " Telling point . Periodic hailstorms on the ridge to drive prey to cover , and seemingly ideal cover waiting  --  beautifulsystem . " But we 'll be knocked silly by hail if we do n't get to cover soon , " Bink said . " I 'll go , " Dee said . Before Bink could protest , she plunged into the territory of the tree . The tentacles quivered , twitching toward her  --  but lacked the imperative to make a real effort . She dashed up and kicked the hephalumph in the trunk  --  and it was solid . " No mirage , " she cried . " Come on in. "  | " Unless she 's a shill , " Crombie muttered . " I tell you , she 's a threat to you , Bink . If she shilled for the tangler , she could trick dozens of people into its clutches  --  " The man was paranoid . Perhaps this was anotheruseful quality for soldiers  --  though again , it did n't seem to have kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it , " Bink said . " But I do believe this hailstorm ! I 'm going in . " And he went . He passed the outer fringe of tentacles nervously , but they remained quiescent . A hungry tangier was not asubtle plant ; it normally grabbed the moment its prey was grabable . Finally Crombie followed . The tree shuddered slightly , as if irritated by its inability to consume then , and that was all . " Well , I knew my talent told the truth It always does , " he said , somewhat weakly . It was actually very nice here . The hailstones had grown to the size of clenched fists , but they bounced of the tree 's upper foliage and piled up in a circle around it , caught by a slight depression . Predator trees tended to sit in such depressions , formed by the action of their tentacles while cleaning brush and rocks out of the way in order to have an attractive lawn for passing crea- tures . The refuse was tossed beyond in a great circle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thetangle was a highly successful type of tree , and some ofthem formed wells whose rims were fashioned from buried bones of past prey . They had been cleaned outnear the North Village , but all children were instructed in this menace . Theoretically , a man pursued by adragon could skirt a tangier , leading the dragon within range of the tentacles  --  if he had both courage and skillWithin the shielded area there was a fine greensward rising in soft hillocks , rather like the torso of a woman Sweet perfume odors wafted through , and the air was pleasantly warm . In short , this was a seemingly idealplace to seek shelter  --  and that was by design . It hadcertainly fooled the hephalumph . Obviously this was ap117good location , for the tangier had grown to enormous girth . But right now they were here rent-free . " Well , my magic was right all the time , " Crombie said . " I should have trusted it . But by the same token . . . " He glanced meaningfully at Dee . Bink wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the location magic was obviously functional . Had it malfunctioned in Dee 's case , or was she really a bad if obscure threat ? If so , what kind ? He could not believe she meant him harm . He had suspectedher of being Iris the Sorceress , but now he did n't believe that ; she showed no sign of the temperament of the mistress of illusion , and personality was not somethingthat magic could conceal for very long . " Why did n't your magic warn you of the stab in the back ? " Bink asked the soldier , making another attempt to ascertain what was reliable and what was not . " I did n't ask it , " Crombie said . " I was a damned fool . But once I see you safely to your Magician , I 'll sure as hell ask it who stabbed me , and then . . . " He fingered the blade of his sword meaningfully . A fair answer . The talent was not a warning signal ; it merely performed on demand . Crombie had obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bink had reason to feel threatened now . Where was the distinctionbetween natural caution and paranoia ? The storm continued . None of them were willing to sleep , because they did not trust the tree to that extent , so they sat and talked . Crombie told a tough story of ancient battle and heroism in the days of Xanth 's Fourth Wave . Bink was no military man , but he found himself caught up in the gallantry of it , and almost wished he had lived in those adventurous times , when men of no magic were considered men . By the end of that story , the storm had eased off , but the hail was piled so high that it did n't seem worthwhile to go out yet . Usually the meltoff from a magic storm was quite rapid once the sun came out again , so it was worth waiting for.  | " Where do you live ? " Bink asked Dee . " Oh , I 'm just a country girl , you know , " she said . " No one else was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no answer , " Crombie snapped suspiciously . She shrugged . " It 's the only answer I have . I ca n't change what I am , much as I might like to . " " It 's the same answer I have , too , " Bink said . " I 'm just a villager , nothing special . I hope the Magician will be able to make me into something special , by finding out that I have some good magic talent no one ever suspected , and I 'm willing to work for him for a year for that . " " Yes , " she said , smiling appreciatively at him . Suddenlyhe felt himself liking her . She was ordinary  --  like him . She was motivated  --  like him . They had something in common . " You 're going for magic so your girl back home will marry you ? " Crombie asked , sounding cynical . " Yes , " Bink agreed , remembering Sabrina with suddenpoignancy . Dee turned away . " And so I can stay in Xanth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the soldier said kindly . " Well , it 's the only chance I have , " Bink replied . " Any gamble is worthwhile when the alternative  --  " " I do n't mean the magic . That 's useful . And staying in Xanth makes sense . I mean marriage . " " Marriage ? " " Women are the curse of mankind , " Crombie said vehemently . " They trap men into marriage , the way this tangle tree traps prey , and they torment them the rest of their lives . " " Now that 's unfair , " Dee said . " Did n't you have a mother ? " " She drove my worthy father to drink and loco , " Crombie asserted . " Made his life hell on earth  --  an , : mine too . She could read our minds  --  that was her tal-ent . " A woman who could read men 's minds : hell indeedp119for a man ! If any woman had been able to read Bink 's mind  --  ugh ! " Must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bink suppressed a smile , but Crombie scowled . " I ran off and joined the army two years before I was of age . Never regretted it . " Dee frowned . " You do n't sound like God 's gift to women , either . We can all be thankful you never touched any . " " Oh , I touch them , " Crombie said with a coarse laugh . " I just do n't marry them . No one of them 's going to get her hooks into me . " " You 're disgusting , " she snapped . " I 'm smart . And if Bink 's smart , he 'll not let you start tempting him , either . " " I was n't ! " she exclaimed angrily . Crombie turned away in evident repugnance . " Ah , you 're all the same . Why do I waste my time talking with the likes of you ? Might as well argue ethics with the devil . " " Well , if you feel that way , I 'll go ! " Dee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge . Bink thought she was bluffing , for the storm , though abating , was still in force with occasional flurries . Coloredhailstones were mounded up two feet high , and the sun was not yet out . But Dee plunged out into it . " Hey , wait ! " Bink cried . He ran after her . Dee had disappeared , hidden by the storm . " Let her go , good riddance , " Crombie said . " She had designs on you ; I know how they work . I knew she was trouble from the start . " Bink put his arms up over his head and face against the hail and stepped out . His feet slid out from under , skidding on hailstones , and he fell headlong into the pile . Hailstones closed in over his head . Now he knew what had happened to Dee . She was buried somewhere out here . He had to close his eyes , for powder from crushedp120stones was getting into them . This was not true ice , but coalesced vapor , magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they were slippery . Something caught his foot . Bink kicked violently , remembering the sea monster near the island of the Sorceress , forgetting that it had been an illusion and that there could hardly be a sea monster here . But its grip was tight ; it dragged him into an enclosure . He scrambled to his feet as it let go . He leaped on the troll shape he saw through the film of dust . Bink found himself flying through the air . He landed hard on his back , the creature drawing on his arm . Trolls were tough ! He squirmed around and tried to grab its legs  --  but the thing dropped on top of him and pinned him firmly to the ground . " Ease up , Bink , " it said . " It 's me  --  Crombie . " Bink did as much of a double-take as he was able to , considering his position , and recognized the soldier . Crombie let him up . " I knew you 'd never find your way out of that mess , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach , your foot . You had magic dust in your eyes , so you could n't recognize me . Sorry I had to put you down . " Magic dust  --  of course . It distorted the vision , makingmen seem like trolls , ogres , or worse  --  and vice versa . It was an additional hazard of such storms , so that people could not see their way out of them . Probablymany victims had seen the tangle tree as an innocent blanket tree . " That 's okay , " Bink said . " You soldiers sure know how to fight . " " All part of the business . Never charge a man who knows how to throw . " Crombie raised one finger near his ear , signifying an idea . " I 'll show you how to do it ; it 's a nonmagical talent you can use . " " Dee ! " Bink cried . " She 's still out there ! " Crombie grimaced . " Okay . I made her walk out ; if if means so much to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man did have some decency , even with regarc to women . " Do you really hate them all ? " Bink askeep121as he girded himself to wrestle with the hail again " Even the ones who do n't read minds ? " " They all read minds , " Crombie asserted . " Most of them do it without magic , is all . But I wo n't swear a. there 's no girl in the whole of Xanth for me . If I fount a pretty one who was n't mean or nagging or deceitful . . . " He shook his head . " But if any like that exist , they sure as hell would n't marry me . " So the soldier rejected all women because he felt the ) rejected him . Well , it was a good enough rationale . Now the storm had stopped . They went out into the piled hailstones , stepping carefully so as not to take any more spills . The colored storm clouds cleared , dissipatingrapidly now that their magic imperative was spent . What caused such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but the course of this journey had convinced him that dead objects did indeed have magic often very strong magic . Maybe it was in the very substanceof Xanth , and it diffused slowly into the living and nonliving things that occupied the land . The living things controlled their shares of magic , channelizing it focusing it , making it manifest at will . The inanimate things released it haphazardly , as in this storm . There had to be a lot of magic here , gathered from a large area . All wasted in a pointless mass of hailstones . Yet not all pointless . Obviously the tangle tree benefitedfrom such storms , and probably there were other ways in which they contributed to the local ecology . Maybe the hail culled out the weaker creatures , animah less fit to survive , facilitating wilderness evolution . And9 other inanimate magic was quite pointed , such as that of Lookout Rock and the Spring of Life  --  its magic distilledfrom water percolating through the entire region intensifying its potency ? Perhaps it was the magic itself that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was affected by magic , and governed by it . Without magic , Xanth would be  --  the vet ) notion filled him with horror  --  Xanth would be Mundane.  |p122The  sun broke through the clouds . Where the beams struck , the hailstones puffed into colored vapor . Their fabric of magic could not withstand the beat of direct sunlight . That made Bink wonder again : was the sun antipathetic to magic ? If the magic emanated from the depths , the surface of the land was the mere fringe of it . If someone ever delved down deep , he might approach the actual source of power . Intriguing notion ! In fact , Bink wished that he could set aside his quest for his own personal magic and make that search for the ultimate nature of reality in Xanth . Surely , way down deep , there was the answer to all his questions . But he could not . For one thing , he had to locate Dee . In a few minutes all the hail was gone . But so was the girl . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Crombie said . " She knows where we are ; she can find us if she wants to . " " Unless she 's in trouble , " Bink said worriedly . " Use your talent ; point her out . " Crombie sighed . " All right . " He closed his eyes , rotated , and pointed down the south side of the ridge . They trotted down  --  and found her tracks in the soft earth at the fringe of the jungle . They followed them and soon caught up . " Dee ! " Bink cried gladly . " We 're sorry . Do n't risk the jungle alone . " She marched on determinedly . " Leave me alone , " Dee said . " I do n't want to go with you . " " But Crombie did n't really mean  --  " Bink said . " He meant . You do n't trust me . So keep away from me . I 'd rather make it on my own . " And that was that . She was adamant . Bink certainly was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need help or anything , call  --  or something  --  " She went on without answering . " She could n't have been very much of a threat , " Bink said forlornly . " She 's a threat , all right , " Crombie insisted . " But nop123threat 's as much of a threat when it 's somewhere else . " They ascended the ridge again and traveled on . In another day they came in sight of the Magician 's castle , thanks to the soldier 's unerring magic directional sense and ability to avoid the dangers of the wilderness . He had been a big help . " Well , that 's it , " Crombie said . " I have seen you to this point safely , and I think that about squares us . I have business of my own elsewhere before I report to the King for reassignment . I hope you find your magic . " " I hope so too , " Bink said . " Thanks for the throws you taught me . " " It was little enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll really serve . Sorry I got the girl mad at you . Maybe my talent was wrong about her after all . " Bink did n't care to discuss that aspect , so he just shook hands and headed for the castle of the Good Magician . T he castle was impressive . It was not large , but it was tall and well designed . It had a deep moat , a stout outer wall , and a high inner tower girt with parapetsand embrasures . It must have been built by magic , because it would have taken an army of skilled craftsmena year to build it by hand . Yet Humfrey was supposed to be a Magician of information , not of construction or illusion . How could he have magicked such an edifice ? No matter ; the castle was here . Bink walked down top124the moat . He heard a horrible kind of galloping splash , and around from behind the castle came a horse , running on the water . No , not a horse  --  a hippocampus , or seahorse , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dolphin . Bink knew the dolphin only from old pictures ; it was a kind of magic fish that breathed air instead of water . Bink stepped back . The thing looked dangerous . It could not follow him out onto land , but it could pulverizehim in water . How was he to cross the moat ? There did not seem to be any drawbridge . Then he noted that the hippocampus wore a saddle . Oh , no ! Ride the water monster ? Yet it obviously was the way to go . The Magician did not want his time wasted by anyone who was n't serious . If he lacked the nerve to ride the seahorse , he did n't deserve to see Humfrey . It made perverse sense . Did Bink really want the answer to his question ? At the price of a year 's service ? The picture of beautiful Sabrina came to his mind , so real , so evocative that all else became meaningless . He walked up to the hippocampus , waiting at the edge of the moat expectantly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It neighed as it sped around the moat , instead of across it . The steed was jubilant , using the water as a veritable race track , while Bink clung desperately to the saddle horn . The powerful front legs of the hippocampus terminated in flippers rather than hooves , scooping gouts of water back on eitherside , drenching him with the spray . The tail , curled in a muscular loop when the creature was stationary , uncoiled and threshed the water with such vigor that the saddle whipped back and forth , threatening to dislodge the rider momentarily . " Neigh ! Ne-ei-igh ! " the monster sounded gleefully . It had him where it wanted him : right in the saddle , ripe for bucking off . The moment he hit the water , itwould turn and devour him . What a fool he had been ! Wait  --  so long as he remained in the saddle , it couldp125not get at him . All he had to do was hang on , and in time it would tire . Easier thought than done . The hippocampus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then immersinghim in the frothing water . It curled its tail into a spiral and rolled , dunking him again and again . Bink was afraid it would stop with him on the bottom , forcinghim to let go or drown . But the saddle was firmly fixed on its backside , and its horse 's head projected the same direction Bink 's head did , so it had to hold its breath when he held his . The monster was exercising , while Bink was merely hanging on ; it was using more energy than he , and so it had to breathe sooner . Hence it could not drown him  --  once he had figured this out . In fact , all he needed to do was keep his head and he would win , for whatever that was worth . Finally the creature gave up . It flopped to the inner gate and lay still while Bink dismounted . He had conqueredthe first hurdle . " Thank you , Hip , " he said , making a little bow to the seahorse . It snorted and splashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden door . It was closed , and he pounded on it with one fist . It was so solid that his hand hurt , and the sound was minimized : dink-dink  --  dink ! He drew his knife and rapped with the handle , since he had lost his new staff in the moat  --  with no better result . If a hollow partition made the most noise , this was indubitably solid . There was no way to force it . Maybe the Magician was out ? There should still be servants attending to the castle . Bink was getting angry . He had made a long , hazardousjourney to get here , and he was ready to pay the exorbitant price for one piddling bit of information  --  and the damned Good Magician lacked the courtesy even to answer the door . Well , he would get in despite the Magician . Somehow . He would demand his audience . He studied the door . It was a good ten feet tall andp126five feet wide ; it seemed to have been made of handhewneight-by-eight posts . The thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinges , which meant it had to open by sliding to one side  --  no , the portals were solid stone . Lifted out of the way ? There were no connecting ropes to haul it up , no pulleys that he could see . There might be hidden screws set into the wood , but that seemed a lot of trouble and somewhat risky . Screws sometimes let go at inopportune moments . Maybe the whole door dropped into the floor ? But that , too , was stone . So it seemed the whole mass simply had to be removed every time someone wanted access . Ridiculous ! It had to be a phony , a dummy . There would be a more sensible aperture for routine use , eithermagical or physical . All he had to do was find it . In the stone ? No , that would be unmanageably heavy ; if it were not , it would represent a weakened place where an enemy could force entry . No point in building a substantial castle with such a liability . Where , then ? Bink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found a crack . He traced it around in a square . Yes . He placed both hands against the center and shoved . The square moved . It slid inward , and finally dropped inside , leaving a hole just big enough for a man to crawl through . Here was his entry . Bink wasted no time . He climbed through the hole . Inside was a dimly illuminated hall . And another monster . It was a manticora  --  a creature the size of a horse , with the head of a man , body of a lion , wings of a dragon , and tail of a scorpion . One of the most ferociousmagical monsters known . " Welcome to lunch , little morsel , " the manticora said , arching its segmented tail up over its back . Its mouth was strange , with three rows of teeth , one inside another  --  but its voice was stranger . It was somethingp127like a flute , and something like a trumpet , beautiful in its fashion but difficult to comprehend . Bink whipped out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , with a good deal more conviction than he felt . The manticora laughed , and now its tones were the sour notes of irony . " You are not anyone else 's lunch , mortal . You have climbed nimbly into my trap . " He had indeed . But Bink was fed up with these pointless obstacles , and also suspected that they were not pointless , paradoxical as that might seem . If the Magician 's monsters consumed all callers , Humfrey would never have any business , never obtain any fees . And by all accounts the Good Magician was a grasping man who existed principally to profit himself ; he needed those exorbitant fees to increase his wealth . So probably this was another test , like those of the seahorseand the door ; all Bink had to do was figure out the solution . " I can walk back out of this cage any time I want to , " Bink said boldly . He willed his knees not to knock together with his shivering . " It is n't made to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're the prisoner , molar-face . " " Molar-face ! " the manticora repeated incredulously , showing about sixty molars in the process . " Why , you pipsqueak mortal , I 'll sting you into a billion-year sufferingsleep ! " Bink made for the square portal . The monster pounced , its tail stabbing forward over its head . It was horribly fast . But Bink had only feinted ; he was already ducking forward , directly at the lion 's claws . It was the opposite direction from that which the monster had expected , and the thing could not reverse in midair . Its deadly tail stabbed into the wood of the door , and its head popped through the square hole . Its lion 's shoulders wedged tightly against it , unable to fit through the hole , and its wings fluttered helplessly . Bink could not resist . He straightened up , turned ,  |p128and  yelled : " You did n't think I came all the way here just to back out again , did you , you half-reared monster ? " Then he planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lifted tail . There was a fluted howl of rage and anguish from the door . Then Bink was away , running down the hall , hoping that there was a man-sized exit . OtherwiseThe door seemed to explode . There was a thump behindas the manticora fell free and rolled back to its feet . It was really angry now ! If there were no way outThere was . The challenge had been to get around the monster , not to kill it ; no man could kill such a creature with a knife . Bink scrambled through the barred gate as the manticora charged down the hall too late , splinters of wood falling from its tail . Now Bink was in the castle proper . It was a fairly dark , dank place , with little evidence of human habitation . Where was the Good Magician ? Surely there would be some way to announce his presence , assuming that the ruckus with the manticora had not sufficed . Bink looked around and spied a danglingcord . He gave it one good yank and stepped back lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this adorable castle . A bell sounded . DONG-DONG , DONG-DONG . A gnarled old elf trotted up . " Who shall I say is call-ing ? " " Kink of the North Village . " " Drink of what ? " " Kink ! B-I-N-K . " The elf studied him . " What shall I say is the business of your master Bink ? " " I am Bink ! My business is the quest for a magical talent . " " And what recompense do you offer for the invaluabletime of the Good Magician ? " " The usual scale : one year 's service . " Then , in ap129lower tone : " It 's robbery , but I 'm stuck for it . Your master gouges the public horrendously . " The elf considered . " The Magician is occupied at the moment ; can you come back tomorrow ? " " Come back tomorrow ! " Bink exploded , thinking of what the hippocampus and manticora would do to him if they got a second chance . " Does the old bugger want my business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , if you 're going to be that way about it , come on upstairs . " Bink followed the little man up a winding staircase . The interior of the castle lightened with elevation and became more ornate , more residential . Finally the elf showed the way into a paper-filled study . The elf seated himself at a big wooden desk . " Very well , Bink of the North Village . You have won your way through the defenses of this castle . What makes you think your service is worth the old gouging bugger 's while ? " Bink started to make an angry exclamation  --  but cut himself off as he realized that this was the Good MagicianHumfrey . He was sunk ! All he could do now was give a straight answer before he got kicked out . " I am strong and I can work . It is for you to decide whether that is worth your while . " " You are oink-headed and doubtless have a grotesqueappetite . You 'd no doubt cost me more in board than I 'd ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be futile to debate such points . He could only antagonize the Magician further . He had really walked into the last trap : the trap of arrogance . " Perhaps you could carry books and turn pages for me . Can you read ? " " Some , " Bink said . He had been a reasonably apt pupil of the centaur instructor , but that had been years ago . " You seem to be a fair hand at insult , too ; maybep130you could talk intruders out of intruding with their petty problems . " " Maybe , " Bink agreed grimly . Obviously , he had really done it this time  --  and after coming so close to success . " Well , come on ; we do n't have all day , " Humfrey snapped , bouncing out of his chair . Bink saw now that he was not a true elf , but a very small human being . An elf , of course , being a magical creature , could not be a Magician . That was part of what had put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracyof that conjecture . Xanth continued to show him ramifications of magic he had not thought of before . Apparently the Magician had accepted the case . Bink followed him to the next room . It was a laboratory , with magical devices cluttering the shelves and piled on the floor , except for one cleared area . " Stand aside , " Humfrey said brusquely , though Bink hardly had room to move . The Magician did not have an endearing personality . It would be a real chore to work for him a year . But it just might be worth it , if Bink learned he had a magic talent , and it was a good one . Humfrey took a tiny bottle from the shelf , shook it , and set it on the floor in the middle of a pentagram  --  a five-sided figure . Then he made a gesture with both hands and intoned something in an arcane tongue . The lid of the bottle popped off . Smoke issued forth . It expanded into a sizable cloud , then coalesced into the shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's horns were vestigial , and his tail had a soft tuft instead of a cutting barb . Furthermore , he wore glasses , which must have been imported from Mundania , where such artifacts were commonly used to shore up the weak eyes of the denizens there . Or so the myths had it . Bink almost laughed . Imagine a near-sighted demon ! " O Beauregard , " Humfrey intoned . " I conjure thee by the authority vested in me by the Compact , tell usp131what magic talent this lad , Bink of the North Village of Xanth , possesses . " So that was the Magician 's secret : he was a demonsummoner . The pentagram was for containing the demonsreleased from their magic bottles ; even a studious demon was a creature of hell . Beauregard focused his lenscovered eyes on Bink . " Step into my demesnes , that I may inspect you properly , " he said . " Nuh-uh ! " Bink exclaimed . " You 're a tough nut , " the demon said . " I did n't ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's his magic ? " The demon concentrated . " He has magic  --  strong magic  --  but  --  " Strong magic ! Bink 's hopes soared . " But I am unable to fathom it , " Beauregard said . He grimaced at the Good Magician . " Sorry , fathead ; I 'll have to renege on this one . " " Then get ye gone , incompetent , " Humfrey snarled , clapping his hands together with a remarkably sharp report . Evidently he was used to being insulted ; it was part of his life style . Maybe Bink had lucked out again . The demon dissolved into smoke and drained back into his bottle . Bink stared at the bottle , trying to determinewhat was visible within it . Was there a tiny figure , hunchedover a miniature book , reading ? Now the Magician contemplated Bink . " So you have strong magic that can not be fathomed . Were you aware of this ? Did you come here to waste my time ? " " No . " Bink said . " I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been any evidence of it . I hoped  --  but I feared I had none . " " Is there anything you know of that could account for this opacity ? A counterspell , perhaps ? " Evidently Humfrey was far from omnipotent . But now that Bink knew he was a demon-conjurer , that explainedit . Nobody summoned a demon without goodp132reason . The Magician charged heavily for his service because he took a heavy risk . " I do n't know of anything , " Bink said . " Except maybe the drink of magic healing water I took . " " Beauregard should not have been deceived by that . He 's a pretty savvy demon , a real scholar of magic . Do you have any of that water with you ? " Bink held out his canteen . " I saved some . Never can tell when it might be needed . " Humfrey took it , poured out a drop on his palm , touched his tongue to it , and grimaced thoughtfully . " Standard formula , " he said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a keg of similar stuff in my cellar . Brewed it myself . Mine is free of the Spring 's self-interest gels , of course . But keep this ; it can be useful . " The Magician set up a pointer attached to a string , beside a wall chart with pictures of a smiling cherub and a frowning devil . " Let 's play Twenty Questions . " He moved his hands , casting a spell , and Bink realized that his prior realization had been premature . Humfrey did do more than demon-summoning  --  but he still specialized in information . " Bink of the North Village , " he intoned . " Have you oriented on him ? " The pointer swung around to indicate the cherub . " Does he have magic ? " The cherub again . " Strong magic ? " Cherub . " Can you identify it ? " Cherub . " Will you tell me its nature ? " The pointer moved to cover the devil . " What is this ? " Humfrey demanded irritably . " No , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't figure why you spirits are balking . " Angrily he cast the release spell and turned to Bink . " There 's something mighty funny here . But it 's become a challenge . I'mp133going to use a truth spell on you . We 'll get to the heart of this . " The Magician waved his stubby arms again , muttered a vile-sounding incantation  --  and suddenly Bink felt strange . He had never experienced this odd type of magic before , with its gestures , words , and assorted apparatus ; he was used to inherent talents that worked when they were willed to work . The Good Magician seemed to be something of a scientist  --  though Bink hardly understood that Mundane term , either . " What is your identity ? " Humfrey demanded . " Kink of the North Village . " It was the truth but this time Bink said it because the spell compelled him to , not because he wanted to . " Why did you come here ? " " To find out whether I have magic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exiled from Xanth and can marry " Enough . I do n't care about the sordid details . " The Magician shook his head . " So you were telling the truth all along . The mystery deepens , the plot thickens . Now  --  what is your talent ? " Bink opened his mouth , compelled to speak  --  and there was an animal roar . Humfrey blinked . " Oh  --  the manticora is hungry . Spell abate ; wait here while I feed him . " He departed . An inconvenient time for the manticora to get hungry ! But Bink could hardly blame the Magician for hastening to the feeding chore . If the monster should break out of its cageBink was left to his own devices . He walked around the room , stepping carefully to avoid the litter , not touching anything . He came to a mirror . " Mirror , mirror on the wall , " he said playfully . " Who is the fairest one of all ? " The mirror clouded , then cleared . A gross fat warty toad peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a magic mirror ; it had shown him the fairest one of all  --  the fairest toad.  | " I mean , the fairest female human being , " he clarified . Now Sabrina looked out at him . Bink had been jokingat first , but he should have realized that the mirror would take him seriously . Was Sabrina really the fairest girl of all ? Probably not , objectively . The mirror showed her because , to Bink 's prejudiced eye , she was the one . To some other manThe picture changed . Now the girl Wynne looked out . Yes , she was pretty too , though too stupid to be worthwhile . Some men would like that very well , however . On the other handNow the Sorceress Iris looked out , in her most beguilingillusion . " Well , it 's about time you got around to me , Bink , " she said . " I can still enable you to  --  " " No ! " Bink cried . And the mirror went blank . He calmed himself , then faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Of course it could ; otherwise it would n't be here . The mirror clouded and cleared . A picture of the cherub appeared , meaning yes . " Why are we having so much trouble discovering my talent ? " The picture that formed this time was that of a foot , a paw  --  a monkey 's paw . Bink looked at it for some time , trying to figure out its meaning , but it eluded him . The mirror must have gotten confused and thrown in an irrelevant image . " What is my talent ? " he asked at last . And the mirror cracked . " What are you doing ? " Humfrey demanded behind him . Bink jumped guiltily . " I -- seem to have broken your mirror , " he said . " I was just  --  " " You were just asking stupidly direct questions of an instrument designed for subtlety , " Humfrey said angrily . " Did you actually think the mirror could reveal what the demon Beauregard balked at ? " " I 'm sorry , " Bink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you 're worth . But you are also a challenge . Let 's get on with it . " The Magicianmade his gesture and incantation again , restoring the truth spell . " What is your  --  " There was a crash . The glass had fallen out of the cracked mirror . " I was n't asking you ! " Humfrey yelled at it . He returned to Bink . " What  --  " There was a shudder . The castle shook . " Earthquake ! " the Magician exclaimed . " Everything happens at once . " He crossed the room and peered out an embrasure . " No , it 's only the invisible giant passing by . " Humfrey returned once more to Bink . This time he squinted at him , hard . " It 's not coincidence . Something is preventing you  --  or anything else  --  from giving that answer . Some very powerful , unidentified magic . Magician-caliber enchantment . I had thought there were only three persons of that rank alive today , but it seems there is a fourth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trent . But none of these have magic of this type . " " Trent ! The Evil Magician ? " " Perhaps you call him evil . I never found him so . We were friends , in our fashion . There is a kind of camaraderieat our level  --  " " But he was exiled twenty years ago . " Humfrey looked slantwise at Bink . " You equate exile with death ? He resides in Mundania . My information does not extend beyond the Shield , but I am sure he survives . He is an exceptional man . But without magic vow . " " Oh . " Bink had equated exile with death , emotionally . This was a good reminder ; there was life beyond e Shield . He still did not want to go there , but at leastdiminished the specter . " Though it galls me exceedingly , I dare not push the uestion further . I am not properly protected against interferencemagic. "  | " But why would anyone try to prevent me from knowing my own talent ? " Bink asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You just ca n't tell it  --  even to yourself . The knowledge is buried deep inside you . And there , it seems , it is going to remain . I simply am not prepared to take the risk involved for a mere one-year service ; I 'd almost certainly take a loss on that con-tract . " " But why would a Magician  --  I mean , I 'm nobody ! How could it benefit anybody else to stop me from  --  " " It might not be a person at all , but a thing placing a geis on you . A geis of ignorance . " " But why ? " Humfrey grimaced . " Lad , you grow repetitive . Your talent could represent some threat to some powerful special interest . As a silver sword is a threat to a dragon , even though it may not be near that dragon . So that entity protects itself by blocking off your knowledge of your talent . " " But  --  " " If we knew that , we 'd know your talent , " Humfrey snapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can I demonstrate my talent , then , so I can stay in Xanth ? " " You do seem to have a problem , " Humfrey remarked , as if it were of only academic importance . He shrugged . " I 'd answer if I could , but I ca n't . There is of course no charge for my service , since I was unable to complete it . I will send a note with you . Perhaps the King will allow you to remain after all . I believe the bylaws specify that each citizen shall be possessed of magic , not that he actually has to demonstrate it in public . On occasion the demonstration is suspended . I re . member one young man who was able to change the color of his urine at will , for example . An affidavit was accepted in lieu of public display . " Failure seemed to have mellowed the Magician considerably . He served Bink a pleasant meal of brown bread and milk  --  from his private breadfruit orchardp137and deerfly stable , respectively  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waste their questions , " he confided . " The trick is not necessarily to iind the answer , but to find the correct question . Yours , s the first real challenge I 've had in years . The last one was  --  let me think  --  the amaranth . This farmer wanted to know how to develop a really superior plant for greens and grain , so he could feed his family better , and bring in a little income for the comforts of life . I located he magic amaranth for him , and now its use has spread all over Xanth , and beyond it too , for all I know . It is possible to make bread from it that is almost indistinguishable from the real thing . " The Magician pulled out a drawer and brought out a special loaf . " See , this has no stem ; it was baked , not budded . " He broke off a chunk for Bink , who was glad to accept it . " Now that was the kind of question to ask . The answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual . Too many desires are of the monkey's-paw variety , in contrast . " " The monkey 's paw ! " Bink exclaimed . " When I asked the magic mirror , it showed me  --  " " It would . The image derives from a Mundane story . They thought it was fiction . But here in Xanth there is magic like that . " " But what . . . ? " " Do you want to invest a year 's service after all ? " " Uh , no , not for that . " Bink concentrated on chewing the new bread . It was tougher than true bread . " Then have it free . It simply means a type of magic that brings you more grief than good , though it grants what you technically ask . Magic you are better off with-out . " Was Bink better off not knowing his talent ? That was hat the mirror had seemed to tell him . Yet how could he , which would deprive him of it entirely , be better an knowledge ? " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not so many now that I built this castle and hid it.  |p138Only  the really determined find their way here now . Like you . " " How did you build it ? " So long as the Magician was talking . . . " The centaurs built it . I told them how to rid themselvesof a local pest , and they served me for a year . They are very skilled craftscreatures , and did a fine job . Periodically I foul up the routes here , applying spells of misdirection , so as not to be pestered by casual querists ; it 's a good location . " " The monsters ! " Bink exclaimed . " The hippocampus , the manticora  --  they 're serving their year 's service , discouraging idle questioners ? " " Of course . Do you think they 'd stay here for the mere pleasure of it ? " Bink wondered . He remembered the unholy glee with which the seahorse had flung itself about . Still , it would naturally prefer the open sea to a mere moat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as . good as real bread . " With your powers of information , you could  --  why , you could be King . " Humfrey laughed , and there was nothing whining bitter about it . " Who in his right mind would want to be King ? It 's a tedious , strenuous job . I am not a disciplinarian , but a scholar . Most of my labor is in making my magic safe and specific , refining it for greater applicability . Much remains to be done , and I am getting old . I ca n't waste time with diversions . Let those who wish the crown take it . " Disconcerted , Bink cast about for someone who wanted to rule Xanth . " The Sorceress Iris  --  " " The trouble with dealing in illusion , " Humfrey said seriously , " is that one begins to be deluded oneself . Iris does n't need power half so much as she needs a good man . " Even Bink could see the truth in that . " But why does n't she marry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has powers you have not yet glimpsed . She requires a man she can re/spect  --  one who has stronger magic than she does . In all Xanth , only I have more magic than she  --  and I 'm of another generation , really too old for her , even if I had my interest in marriage . And of course we would be a mismatch , for our talents are opposite . I deal in truth , she in illusion . I know too much , she imagines too much . So she conspires with lesser talents , convincing herself that it can somehow work out . " He shook his tread . " It is too bad , really . With the King fading , and no Heir Apparent , and this alternate requirement that the crown go only to a full Magician , it is entirely possible that the throne will be subject to her machinations . Not every young man has your integrity or loyalty to Xanth . " Bink felt a chill . Humfrey knew about Iris 's offer , about their encounter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept track of what was going on in Xanth . But he did not , it seemed , bother to interfere . He just watched . Maybe he investigated the background of specific seekers while the seahorse , wall , and manticora delayed them , so that by the time one won through , Humfrey was ready . Maybe he saved the information , in case someone came to ask " What is the greatest danger facing Xanth ? " , whereupon he could collect his fee for answering . " If the King dies , will you take the crown ? " Bink asked . " As you said , it will have to go to a powerful Magician , and for the good of Xanth  --  " " You pose a question almost as awkward as the one that brought you here , " the Good Magician said ruefully . " I do have a certain modicum of patriotism , but I also have a policy against interfering with the natural scheme of things . There is some substance to the conceptof the monkey 's paw ; magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely no alternative I would accept the crown  --  but first I would search most diligentlyfor some superior Magician to assume the chore . We have not had a top talent appear in a generation ; one is overdue . " He gazed speculatively at Bink . " Therep140seems to be magic of that caliber associated with you but we can not harness it if we can not define it . So doubt you are the heir to the throne . " Bink exploded with incredulous , embarrassed laugh . ter . " Me ? You insult the throne . " " No , there are qualities in you that would honor the throne  --  if you only had identified , controllable magic . The Sorceress may have chosen better than she knew , ' or intended . But evidently there is countermagic that balks you  --  though I am not sure the source of that countermagic would make a good King either . It is a strange matter , most intriguing . " Bink was tempted by the notion of being a potent Magician , becoming King , and ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew , deep inside , that he lacked the qualities required , despite Humfrey 's remarks . This was not merely a matter of magic , but of basic life style and ambition . He could never sentence a man to death or exile , however justified that sentence might be , or lead an army into battle , or spend all day . deciding the altercations of citizens . The sheer responsibilitywould soon weigh him down . " You 're right . No sensible person would want to be King . All I want is to , marry Sabrina and settle down . " " You are a most sensible lad . Stay the night , and on the morrow I will show you a direct route home , with protections against the hazards on the way . " " Nickelpede repellent ? " Bink asked hopefully , remembering the trenches Cherie the centaur had hurdled . " Precisely . You will still have to keep your wits about you ; no route is safe for a stupid man . But two days ' travel on foot will suffice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather liked the castle and its denizens ; even the manticora was affable now that the Magician had given the word . " I would not really have eaten you , though I admit to being tempted for a moment or three when you booted me inp141the . . . tail , " it told Bink . " It is my job to scare off those who are not serious . See , I am not confined . " Itshed against the bars , and the inner gate swung open . My year is almost up , anyway ; I 'll almost be sorry to uve it end . " " What question did you bring ? " Bink inquired somehatnervously , trying not to brace himself too obouslyfor flight . In an open space , he was no possible atch for the manticora . " I asked whether I have a soul , " the monster said riously . Again Bink had to control his reaction . A year 's sercefor a philosophical question ? " What did he tell ou ? " " That only those who possess souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never needed to ask . You paid a year for nothing . " " No . I paid a year for everything . Possession of a soul means that I can never truly die . My body may slough away , but I shall be reborn , or if not , my shade will linger to settle unfinished accounts , or I shall reside forever in heaven or hell . My future is assured ; I shall never suffer oblivion . There is no more vital question or answer . Yet that answer had to be in the proper form . A simple yes or no answer would not have satisfied me ; it could be a blind guess , or merely the Magician 's offhandopinion . A detailed technical treatise would merely have obfuscated the matter . Humfrey phrased it in such a way that its truth was self-evident . Now I need never doubt again . " Bink was moved . Considered that way , it did make sense . Humfrey had delivered good value . He was an honest Magician . He had shown the manticora  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in Xanth . If the fiercest conglomerate monsters had souls , with all that implied , who could condemn them as evil ?  |p142The  path was broad and clear , with no impingingmagic . Only one thing chilled Bink : a region with small - wormlike holes in the trunks of trees and sur- rounding rocks . Holes that wiggled straight through from one side to another . The wiggles had been here ! But he calmed himself . The wiggles had not passed recently , of course ; that menace had been abolished . But where they had infested , it was horrible , for the little flying worms had drilled magically through anything that got in their way , including animals and people . Atree could survive a few neat holes , but a person could bleed to death , assuming he did not die outright from the holing of some vital organ . The mere thought made Bink wince . He hoped the wiggles never spawned again in Xanth  --  but there was no certainty about that There was no certainty about anything where magic was involved . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In half an hour Bink reached the chasm  --  and there , sure enough , was the impossible bridge the Good Magician had told him of . He verified its existence by tossing a handful of dirt and observing the pattern of its fall into the depths ; it guided around one section . Had he known of this on the way over  --  but of course that was the thing about information . Without it , a person suffered enormous complications . Who would have thought there was an invisible bridge all the way across ? Yet his long detour had not been an entire loss . He had participated in the rape hearing , and helped thep143shade , and witnessed some fantastic illusions , and resCuedCrombie the soldier , and generally learned a lot ore about the land of Xanth . He would n't care to do It all over again , but the experience had made him how . He stepped out onto the bridge . There was one thing about it , the Magician had warned him : once he started across , he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the chasm . It was a one-wayp , existing only ahead of him . So he walked acrossIdly , though the gulf opened out awesomely beneath im . Only his hand on the invisible rail reassured him . He did risk a look down . Here the base of the chasm Was extremely narrow  --  a virtual crack rather than afralley . The Gap dragon could not run here . But theremed to be no way to climb down the steep clifflope ; if the fall did not kill a person , starvation and exposure would . Unless he managed to straddle the narrowestpart of the crack and walk east or west to a bettersection  --  where the dragon could then catch him . Bink made it across . All it took was knowledge and confidence . His feet safely on land , he looked back . There was no sign of the bridge , of course , and no obviousapproach to it . He was not about to risk another crossing . The nervous release left him thirsty . He saw a spring to one side of the path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . He looked back toward the chasm , and there was no path . Oh  --  it led away from the bridge , not toward it . Routine one-way magic . He proceeded to the spring . He had water in his canteen , but it was Spring of Life water , which he avoided drinking , saving it for some future emergency . A driblet of water emerged from the spring to flow along a winding channel and finally trickle down into the chasm . The channel was richly overgrown with range plants , species that Bink had never observed before : a strawberry runner bearing beechnuts , and ferns with deciduous leaves . Odd , but no threat to his wel/fare . Bink looked around carefully for predator beasts that might lurk near a water hole , then lay down to puthis mouth to the waiting pool . As he lowered his head , he heard a fluting cry above him . " You 'll be s000rry ! " it seemed to say . He glanced up into the trees . A birdlike thing perched there , possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coiled snake tail . Nothing to concernhim , so long as she kept her distance . He bent his head again  --  and heard a rustle , too close . He jumped up , drew his knife , moved a few paces , and through the trees sighted an incredible thing . Two creatures were locked in combat : a griffin and a unicorn . One was male , the other female , and they were  --  they were not fighting , theyBink retreated , profoundly embarrassed . They we two different species ! How could they ! Disgusted , he returned to the spring . Now he note the recent tracks of the creatures : both unicorn and griffin had come to drink here , probably within the hour . Maybe they had crossed the invisible bridge , as he had , and seen the spring , so conveniently located . So , the water could hardly be poisonedSuddenly he caught on . This was a love spring . Any one who drank of this water would become compellinglyenamored of the first creature he encountered thereafter , andHe glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it , insatiably . Bink backed away from the spring . If he had drunk from it shuddered . He was no longer remotely thirsty . " Aw , go take a drink , " the harpy fluted . Bink swept up a rock and hurled it at her . She squawked and fluttered higher , laughing coarsely . One of her droppings just missed him . There was nothing more hateful than a harpy . Well , the Good Magician had warned him that the path home was not entirely free of problems . Thisp145spring must be one of the details Humfrey had n't ought important enough for specific mention . Once Bink was back on the trail along which he had originallycome , the hazards would be familiar , such as thepeace pinesHow would he get through them ? He needed an enemyto travel with , and he had none . Then he had a bright idea . " Hey you  --  birdbrain ! " he called up into the foliage . " Stay away from me , or I 'll stuff your tail down your filthy throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse . What a vocabulary she had ! Bink threw another rock at her . " I 'm warning you  --  do n't follow me , " he cried . " I 'll follow you to the edge of the Shield itself , " she screeched . " You 'll never get rid of me . " Bink smiled privately . Now he had a , suitable companion . He hiked on , dodging the occasional droppings the harpy hurled at him , hoping her fury would carry her through the pines . After that well , first things first . Soon the path merged with the one he had taken south . Curious , he sighted along the main path both ways ; it was visible north and south . He looked back the way he had just come  --  and there was only deep forest . He took a step back along where he knew he had passed  --  and found himself knee-deep in glow-briers . The weeds sparkled as they snagged on his legs , and only by maneuvering with extreme caution did he manage to extricate himself without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell from her perch . There was simply no path here , this direction . But the moment he faced about again , there it was , leading cleanly through the briers to join the main route . Ah , well  --  why did he even bother to question such things ? Magic was magic ; it had no rationale except its own . Everyone knew that . Everyone except himself , at times . He hiked all day , passing the brook where to drink was to become a fish  --  " Have a drink , harpy ! "  --  butp146she already knew of the enchantment , and reviled him with double fury ; the peace pines  --  " Have a nap , harpy ! " ; and the trench with the nickelpedes  --  " I 'll fetch you something to eat , harpy ! "  --  but actually he used the repellent the Good Magician had provided , and never even saw a nickelpede . At last he stopped at a farmhouse in the centaur territoryfor the night . The harpy finally gave up her chase ; she dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were older centaurs , unaggressive , interested in the news of the day . They listened avidly to the narration of his experiences across the chasm and consideredthis to suffice for his room and board . Their grandchild colt was staying with them , a happy-go-lucky prancing tyke of barely twenty-five years  --  Bink 's age , but equivalent to a quarter that in human terms . Bink played with him and did handstands for him ; that was a trick no centaur could do , and the colt was fascinated . Next day he traveled north again , and there was no sign of the harpy . What a relief ; he would almost have preferred to risk the peace pines alone . His ears felt indeliblysoiled after the day of her expletives . He passed through the remainder of the centaur area without en- , countering anyone . As evening approached , he reached the North Village . " Hey ! The Spell-less Wonder is back , " Zink cried . A hole appeared at Bink 's feet , causing him to stumble involuntarily . Zink would have made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and proceeded toward his house . He was back , all right . Why had he bothered to hurry ? The examination was held next morning , in the outdooramphitheater . The royal palms formed colonnades setting off the stage area . The benches were formed from the projecting convoluted knees of a giant dryland cypress tree . The back was braced by four huge honeymapletrees . Bink had always liked this formation  --  but now it was a place of discomfort . His place of trial.  |p147The  old King presided , since this was one of his royal offices . He wore his jewel-encrusted royal robe and his handsome gold crown and carried the ornate scepter , symbols of his power . All citizens bowed as the fanfare sounded . Bink could not help feeling a shiver of awe as the panoply of royalty manifested . The King had an impressive white mane and a long heard , but his eyes tended to drift aimlessly . Periodicallya servitor would nudge him to prevent him from falling asleep , and to remind him of the ritual . At the start , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He held his palsied hands high and mumbled his invocation . At first there was silence ; then , just as it seemed the magic had failed entirely , a ghostly gust of wind passed through the glade , stirring up a handful of leaves . No one said anything , though it was evident that this manifestation could have been mere coincidence . It was certainly a far cry from a storm . But several of the ladiesdutifully put up umbrellas , and the master of ceremoniesquickly proceeded to the business at hand . Bink 's parents , Roland and Bianca , were in the front row , and so was Sabrina , fully as lovely as he had rememberedher . Roland caught Bink 's eye and nodded encouragingly , and Bianca 's gaze was moist , but Sabrinai 's eyes were downcast . They were all afraid for him . With reason , he thought . " What talent do you proffer to justify your citizenship ? " the master of ceremonies asked Bink . He was Munly , a friend of Roland 's ; Bink knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was duty-bound to follow the forms . Now it was upon him . " I  --  I ca n't show it , " Bink said . " But I have the Good Magician Humfrey 's note that I do have magic . " He held out the note with a trembling hand . The man took it , glanced at it , and passed it to the King . The King squinted , but his eyes were so watery that he evidently could not read it.  | " As Your Majesty can see , " Munly murmured discreetly , " it is a message from Magician Humfrey , bearinghis magic seal . " This was a picture of a fiippered creature balancing a ball on its snout . " It states that this person possesses an undefined magical talent . " Something like fire lighted the old monarch 's ashy eye momentarily . " This counts for naught , " he mumbled . " Humfrey is not King ; I am ! " He let the paper drop to the ground . " But  --  " Bink protested . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was hopeless . The King was foolishly jealous of the Magician Humfrey , whose power was still strong , and would not heed the message . But , for whateverreason , the King had spoken . Argument would only complicate things . Then he had an idea . " I have brought the King a present , " Bink said . " Water from a healing Spring . " Munly 's eyes lighted . " You have magic water ? " He was alert to the possibilities of a fully functional King . " In my canteen , " Bink said . " I saved it  --  see , it healed my lost finger . " He held up his left hand . " It also cured my cold , and I saw it help other people . It heals anything , instantly . " He decided not to mention the attached obligation . Munly 's talent was the conjuration of small objects . " With your permission  --  " " Granted , " Bink said quickly . The canteen appeared in the man 's hand . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , Bink had real hope . Munly approached the King again . " Kink has brought a gift for Your Majesty , " he announced . " Magic water . " The King took the canteen . " Magic water ? " he repeated , hardly seeming to comprehend . " It heals all ills , " Munly assured him . The King looked at it . One swallow , and he would be able to read the Magician 's message , to brew decent .  |p149storms  again  --  and to make sensible judgments . This could reverse the course of Bink 's demonstration . " You imply I am sick ? " the King demanded . " I need no healing ! I am as fit as I ever was . " And he turned the canteen upside down , letting the precious fluid pour out on the ground . It was as if Bink 's life blood were spilling out , not mere water . He saw his last chance ruined , by the very senility he had thought to alleviate . On top of that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he could not be cured again . Was this the retribution of the Spring of Life for his defiance of it ? To tempt him with incipient victory , then withdraw it at the critical moment ? Regardless , he was lost . Munly knew it too . He stooped to pick up the canteen , and it vanished from his hand , returned to Bink 's house . " I am sorry , " he murmured under his breath . Then , loudly : " Demonstrate your talent . " Bink tried . He concentrated , willing his magic , whatever it might be , to break its geis and manifest . Somehow . But nothing happened . He heard a sob . Sabrina ? No , it was his mother , Bianca . Roland sat with stony face , refusing by his code of honor to let personal interest interfere . Sabrina still would not look at him . But there were those who did : " kink , Jama , and Potipher were all smirking . Now they had reason to feel superior ; none of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . It was over . Again he hiked . This time he headed westward , towardthe isthmus . He carried a new staff and a hatchet and his knife ; and his canteen had been refilled with conventional water . Bianca had provided more excellent sandwiches , flavored by her tears . He had nothing from Sabrina ; he had not seen her at all since the decision . Xanth law did not permit an exile to take more than he could conveniently carry , and no valuables , for fear ofp150attracting unwanted attention from the Mundanes . Though the Shield protected Xanth , it was impossible to be too safe . Bink 's life was essentially over , for he had been exiledfrom all that he had known . He was in effect an I orphan . Never again would he experience the marvels of magic . He would be forever bound , as it were , to the ground , the colorless society of Mundania . Should he have accepted the offer of the Sorceress Iris ? At least he could have remained in Xanth . Had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind . What was right was right , and wrong was wrong . The strangest thing was that he did not feel entirely despondent . He had lost citizenship , family , and fiancee , and faced the great unknown of the Outside  --  yet there was a certain quixotic spring to his step . Was it a counterreaction buoying his spirit so that he would not suicide  --  or was he in fact relieved that the decision had at last been made ? He had been a freak among the magic people ; now he would be among his own kind . No  --  that was n't it . He had magic . He was no freak . Strong magic , Magician-caliber . Humfrey had told him so , and he believed it . He merely was unable to utilize it . Like a man who could make a colored spot on the wall  --  when there was no wall handy . Why he should be magically mute he did not know  --  but it meant that he was right , the decision of the King wrong . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him . No  --  not that either . His parents had refused to compromisethe law of Xanth . They were good , honest people , and Bink shared their values . He had refused a similar compromise when tempted by the Sorceress . Rolandand Bianca could not help him by accompanying him into an exile they did not deserve  --  or by trying to help him stay by cheating the system . They had done what they felt was right , at great personal sacrifice , and he was proud of them . He knew they loved him , but had let him go his own way without interference . That was part of his buried joy.  |p151And  Sabrina  --  what then of her ? She too had refused to cheat . Yet he felt she lacked the commitment of his parents to principle . She would have cheated , had she had sufficient reason . Her surface integrity was because she had not been moved strongly by Bink 's misfortune . Her love had not been deep enough . She had loved him for the magic talent she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talented parents . The loss of that potential talent had undercut that love . She had not really wanted him as a person . And his love for her was now revealed as similarly shallow . Sure , she was beautiful  --  but she had less actualpersonality than , say , the girl Dee . Dee had walked off because she had been insulted , and stuck by her decision . Sabrina would do the same , but for a different reason . Dee had not been posturing ; she had really been angry . With Sabrina it would have been more contrived , with more art and less emotion  --  because she had less emotion . She cared more about appearances than the reality . Which reminded Bink of the Sorceress Iris again  --  the ultimate creature of appearances . What a temper she had ! Bink respected temper ; it was a window to the truth at times when little else offered . But Iris was too violent . That palace-destruction scene , complete with storm and dragon . . . Even stupid whatshername  --  the lovely girl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she had feelings . He had , he hoped , enabled her to escape from the Gap dragon . There had not been much artifice in her . But Sabrina was the perfect actress , and so he had never really been sure of her love . She had been a picturein his mind , to be summoned in time of need , just to look at . He had not actually wanted to marry her . It had taken exile to show him his own motives . Whatever it was that he wanted in a girl , ultimately , Sabrinalacked . She had beauty , which he liked , and personality  --  whichwas not the same as character  --  and attractivemagic . All these things were good  --  veryp152good  --  and he had thought he loved her . But when the crisis came , Sabrina 's eyes had been averted . That said it all . Crombie the soldier had spoken truly : Bink would have been a fool to marry Sabrina . Bink smiled . How would Crombie and Sabrina have gotten along together ? The ultimately demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would the soldier 's inherent ferocity constitute a challenge to the girl 's powers of accommodation ? Would they , after all , have fashioned an enduring relationship ? It almost seemed they might . They would eitherhave an immediate and violent falling out or a similarlyspectacular falling in . Too bad they could n't meet , and that he could not be present to observe such a meeting . The whole of his Xanth experience was passing glibly through his mind now that he was through with it . For the first time in his life , Bink was free . He no longer needed magic . He no longer needed romance . He no longer needed Xanth . His aimlessly roving eye spotted a tiny dark spot on a tree . He experienced a sudden shudder . Was it a wiggle wound ? No , just a discoloration . He felt relief  --  and realized that he had been fooling himself , at least to this extent . If he no longer needed Xanth , he would not care about things like the wiggles . He did need Xanth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have it . Then he approached the station of the Shield man , and his uncertainty increased . Once he passed through the Shield , Xanth and all its works would be forever behind him . " What are you up to ? " the Shield man asked him . He was a big , fat youth with pale features . But he was part of the vital net of magic that formed the barrier to outsidepenetration of Xanth . No living creature could f pass the Shield , either way  --  but since no inhabitant of Xanth wanted to depart , its net effect was to stop all Mundane intrusions . The touch of the Shield meant death  --  instant , painless , final . Bink did n't know how itp153worked  --  but he did n't know how any magic worked , really . It just was . " I have been exiled , " Bink said . " You have to let me through the Shield . " He would not , of course , attempt to cheat ; he would leave as directed . Had he been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked ; one villager 's talent was spot location of individuals , and he was now tuned to Bink . He would know if Bink remained on this side of the Shield today . The youth sighed . " Why do all the complications have to come in my shift ? Do you know how difficult it is to open up a man-sized hole without bollixing the whole damn Shield ? " " I do n't know anything about the Shield , " Bink admitted . " But I was exiled by the King , so  --  " " Oh , very well . Now look  --  I ca n't go with you to the Shield ; I have to stay here at my station . But I can make an opening spell that will cancel out one section for five seconds . You be there , and you step through on schedule , because if it closes on you , you 're dead . " Bink gulped . For all his thoughts about death and exile , now that it had come to the test , he did want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The magic stone does n't care who dies . " Meaningfully the youth tapped the boulder he leaned against . " You mean that dingy old stone is it ? " Bink asked . " Shieldstone . Sure . The Magician Ebnez located it nearly a century ago , and tuned it to form the Shield . Without it , we 'd still be subject to invasion by the Mun-danes . " Bink had heard of the Magician Ebnez , one of the great historical figures . In fact , Ebnez was in Bink 's family tree . He had been able to adapt things magically . In his hands a hammer could become a sledgehammer , or a piece of wood could become a section of windowframe . Whatever existed became whatever was needed  --  within certain limits . He could not adapt air into food , for example , or make a suit of clothing out ofp154water . But it had been amazing what he could do . So he had adapted a potent deathstone into the Shieldstone , killing at a set distance instead of up close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a proud achievement ! " Okay , now , " the youth said . " Here 's a timestone . " He tapped it against the larger rock , and the small piece fractured into two segments , each fading from the originalred to white . He handed one fragment to Bink . " When this goes red , you step across ; they 're synched . The opening will be right in front of the big beechnut tree  --  and for only five seconds . So you be ready , and move  --  on red . " " Move on red , " Bink agreed . " Right . Now move ; sometimes these timestones heal fast . I 'll be watching mine , so as to time the spell ; you watch yours . " Bink moved . He ran along the path to the west . Usually a fractured timestone took half an hour or so to heal  --  but it varied somewhat with the quality of the stone , the surrounding temperature , and assorted unknownfactors . Maybe it was inherent in the original piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if one were in the sunshine and the other buried in a well . But , again , what use to seek a rationale for magic ? What was , was . And would be no more  --  for him . None of this had meaning in Mundania . He hove in sight of the Shield  --  or rather , its effect . The Shield itself was invisible , but there was a line of dead vegetation where it touched the ground , and the , corpses of animals that had been so foolish as to try to cross that line . Sometimes jumpdeer got confused and sprang through to the safe ground on the other side  --  but they were already dead . The Shield was invisibly thin , but absolute . Occasional Mundane creatures blundered into it . A detail walked the line each day on the Xanth side , checking for corpses , hauling them out of the Shieldp155when they were partway across , giving them safe burial . It was possible to handle something that lay across the Shield , so long as the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a grisly chore , sometimes assignedas punishment . There were never any human Nfundanes , but there was always the fear that there might one day be some , with all the complications that would entail . Ahead was the spreading beechnut tree . One branch reached out toward the Shield  --  and the tip of that branch was dead . Wind must have made it sway across . It helped identify the spot where he should cross . There was an odor associated with this line of death , too . Probably it was the decay of many tiny creatures : worms in the earth , bugs flying through the Shield , rottingwhere they fell . This was the region of death . Bink glanced down at the stone he held  --  and sucked in his breath in shock . It was red ! Had it just now changed  --  or was he already too late ? His life depended on the answer . Bink launched himself at the Shield . He knew the sensible thing to do was return to the Shield tender and explain why he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been the actual change of the stone 's color that had attracted his attention , in which case hedid have time . So he took the foolish course , and tried for it . One second . Two . Three . He 'd better have the whole five , because he was n't there yet . The Shield seemed close , but it took time to make the supposedly instant decision and abolish inertia and get up speed . He was passing the beechnut tree at a dead run  --  maybe literallydead  --  going too fast to stop . Four seconds hewas crossing the line of death . If it closed on his trailing leg , would all of him die , or just the leg ? Five  --  he felt a tingle . Six  --  no , time was up , stop counting , start panting . He was through ; was he alive ? He rolled in the dirt , kicking up dry leaves and small bones . Of course he was alive ! How could he worryp156about it otherwise ? As with the manticora , concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn'tBink sat up , shaking something dead out of his hair . So he had made it . That tingle must have been an effect of the turned-off Shield , since it had n't hurt him . Now it was done . He was free of Xanth forever . Free to make his own life , without being ridiculed or mothered or tempted . Free to be himself . Bink put his face in his hands and cried . After a time he got up and walked on , into the dread world of the Mundanes . It really did not look much different : the trees were similar , the rocks unchanged , and the ocean shore he paralleled was exactly like an ocean shore . Yet an intense nostalgia gripped him . His prior euphoria had been but the swing of the pendulum , providing a false buoyancy . Better if he had died in the crossing . Well , he could still go back . Just step across the line . Death would be painless , and he could be buried in Xanth . Was that what other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had called his own bluff . He loved Xanth , and missed it terribly already  --  but he did not want to die . He would simply have . to make his way among the Mundanes . Others had surely done it before him . Maybe he would even be happy there . The isthmus was mountainous . Bink sweated as he climbed the steep pass . Was this the counterpart to the chasm , a ridge that rose as high above the land as thep157chasm sank beneath it ? Did a ridge dragon run along the heights ? No , not in Mundania . But possibly such geography did have something to do with the magic . If the magic quality washed down from the height , concentratingin the depth  --  no , that did n't seem to make much sense . Most of it would have washed into the ocean and been hopelessly diluted . For the first time he wondered what Mundania was really like . Was it actually possible to survive without magic ? It would not be nearly as nice as Xanth , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should be some decent places in it . The people should not be evil ; after all , his ancestors had come from Mundane stock . Indications were that languageand many customs were the same . He heaved himself over the rise of the pass , braced for his first real glimpse of the new world  --  and suddenly he was surrounded by men . An ambush ! Bink whirled to run . Maybe he could trick them into plunging into the Shield , and be rid of them the easy way  --  not that he wanted to be responsible for their death . Anyhow , he had to try to escape them . But as he turned , his body responding somewhat slower than his thoughts , he found a man behind him , blocking the way with drawn sword . The sensible thing to do was to give up . They had him outnumbered and surrounded , and they could have put an arrow into his back if they had wanted to kill him outright . If all they wanted to do was rob him , he had almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bink 's strong point . Not when he was under pressure , or surprised . Reflecting after the fact , he was very sensible and intelligent , but that was n't much use at this stage . If only he 'd had a talent like that of his mother , only stronger , so that he could turn time back a couple of hours and replay all his crises to better advantageBink charged the man with the sword , swinging his staff to block the blade . But someone tackled him ,  |p158bringing  him down hard before he took two steps . Bink 's face struck the dirt , and he took a mouthful . Still he fought , twisting about to get at the man who held him . Then they were all on him , bearing him down . Bink had no chance ; in moments he was tied and gagged . A man thrust his tough face close to Bink 's eyes as two others held him erect . " Now get this , Xanth  --  if you try any magic , we 'll knock you out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bink had none he could use  --  or that if he had , it would be no good out here beyond the Shield . But he nodded , showing he understood . Maybe they would treat him better if they thought he could somehow strike back . They marched him down the other side of the pass and to a military camp on the mainland beyond the isthmus . What was an army doing here ? If it were an invasion of Xanth , it could not succeed ; the Shield would kill a thousand men as readily as one . They brought him to the main tent . Here , in a screened enclosure , sat a handsome man in his forties , wearing some sort of green Mundane uniform , a sword , a neat mustache , and an emblem of command . " Here is the spy , General , " the sergeant said respectfully . The General glanced at Bink , appraising him . There 4 was dismaying intelligence in that cool study . This was no bandit thug . " Release him , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , sir , " the sergeant said respectfully . He untied Bink and removed his gag . " Dismissed , " the General murmured , and without a word the soldiers were gone . They were certainly disciplined . Bink chafed at his wrists , trying to rub the pain out , amazed at the General 's confidence . The man was well formed , but not large ; Bink was younger and taller and surely stronger . If he acted quickly , he might escape . Bink crouched , ready to jump at the man and **109;3793;TOOLONG down . Suddenly the General 's sword was in his hand , pointing at Bink . The man 's draw had been a blur ; the weapon had jumped to his hand as if by magic , but that obviously could not be the case here . " I would not advise it , young man , " the General said , as if warninghim not to step on a thorn . Bink staggered , trying to brake without falling on the point of the sword . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sword retreated , returning to its scabbard . The General , now on his feet , caught Bink by his elbows and stood him back upright . There was such precision and power in the action that Bink knew he had grossly underestimated this man ; he had no chance to overcome him , with or without the sword . " Be seated , " the General said mildly . Cowed , Bink moved awkwardly to the wooden chair and sat on it . Now he was conscious of his own dirty Lice and hands , the disorganization of his apparel , in ontrast to the impeccable neatness of the General . " Your name ? " " Bink . " He did not give his village , since he was no longer affiliated with it . What was the purpose of this question , anyway ? He was a nonentity regardless of his name . " I am the Magician Trent . Perhaps you know of me . " It took a moment for the import to register . Then Bink did n't believe it . " Trent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exiled . Twenty years ago . Precisely . " " But Trent was  --  " " Ugly ? A monster ? Crazy ? " The Magician smiled , showing none of these traits . " What stories do they tell of me today in Xanth ? " Rink thought of Justin Tree . The fish of the stream , turned to lightning bugs to harass the centaurs . The opponentswho had been transformed to water forms and left to die on land . " You  --  he was a power-hungry spell-caster who tried to usurp the throne of Xanthp160when I was but a child . An evil man whose evil still lives after him . " Trent nodded . " This is a kinder repute than is nor- i many accorded the loser in a political contest . I was . about your present age when I was banished . Perhaps 1 our cases are similar . " " No . I never killed anyone . " " They accuse me of that too ? I transformed many , but I did that instead of killing . I have no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other means . " " A fish on land still dies ! " " Oh , so that is how they put it . That would indeed be murder . I did transform enemies to fish  --  but always in water . On land I utilized only land forms . Possibly som subsequently died , but that was the doing of predato in the normal course of nature . I never  --  " " I do n't care . You abused your magic . I am not at like you . I  --  had no magic . " The fair eyebrow lifted expressively . " No magic ? E erybody in Xanth has magic . " " Because they exile those who do n't have it , " B ' said , with a flash of bitterness . Trent smiled , and it was a surprisingly winning e pression . " Nevertheless , our interests may be paralle Bink . How would you like to return with me 1 Xanth ? " For an instant wild hope flared in his breast . Return , But immediately he quashed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't say that . To every act of magic then is a countermagic . It is merely a matter of invoking it , You see , I have developed a counter to the Shield . " Again Bink had to take stock of his reactions . " If you had that , you could have gone into Xanth already . " " Well , there is a certain small problem of application. ? You see , what I have is an elixir distilled from a plant that grows on the very fringe of the magical zone . Th magic extends somewhat beyond the Shield , you under . stand  --  otherwise the Shield itself would n't work , for it is magic and can not operate beyond the magic de.  |p161mesnes  . This plant , which seems to be of basically Mundane stock , competes at the fringe with the magical plants of Xanth . It is very difficult to compete with magic , so it evolved a very special property : it supressesmagic . Do you appreciate the significance ? " " Suppresses magic ? Maybe that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that disquieting calculation . So you feel you were wronged by the present administration ? We do have something in common . " Bink wanted no common ground with the Evil Magician , however winning the man 's aspect might be . He knew that Evil could put on an extremely fair face ; otherwisehow would Evil ever have survived in the world so long ? " What are you getting at ? " " The Shield is magic . Therefore the elixir should nullifyit . But it does not , because the source of the Shield is not touched . It is necessary to reach the Shieldstone itself . Unfortunately , we do not know precisely where that stone is now , and there is not enough elixir to blan- ket the entire peninsula of Xanth , or even a significant fraction of it . " " Makes no difference , " Bink said . " Your knowing where the Shieldstone is would not bring it within your reach . " " Ah , but it would . You see , we have a catapult , with a sufficient range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it mounted on a ship that can sail right around Xanth . So it is very likely that we could drop a container of elixir on the Shieldstone  --  if we only had the precise coordinates . " Now Bink understood . " The Shield would collapse ! " " And my army would overrun Xanth . Of course , the magic-damping effect would be temporary , for the elixir dissipates readily  --  but a mere ten minutes would sufficeto get the bulk of my army across the line . I have been drilling the men in swift short-range maneuvers . After that it would be merely a matter of time until the throne was mine . "  | " You would return us to the days of conquest and 11. ravage , " Bink said , horrified . " The Thirteenth Wave , worse than all the rest . " " By no means . My army is disciplined . We shall exertprecisely that force that is necessary , no more . My magic will probably eliminate most resistance anyway , so there need be very little violence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rule . " " So you have n't changed , " Bink said . " You 're still hungry for illicit power . " " Oh , I have changed , " Trent assured him . " I have become less naive , more educated and sophisticated . The Mundanes have excellent educational facilities and a broader world view , and they are ruthless politicians . I will not this time underestimate the determination of my opposition or leave myself foolishly vulnerable. have no doubt I will make a better King than I woul have twenty years ago . " " Well , count me out . " " But I must count you in , Bink . You know where th Shieldstone is located . " The Evil Magician leaned fo ward persuasively . " It is important that the shot be pr cise ; we have only a quarter pound of elixir , and that the labor of two years ' work . We have virtually denud the fringe region of the source plants ; our supply is in placeable . We dare not guess at the location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map that only you can draw . " So there it was . Trent had posted his men to ambush i any travelers from Xanth , so that they could update him on the precise position of the Shieldstone . That was the only piece of information the Evil Magician needed to initiate his wave of conquest . Bink had merely happened to be the first exile to walk into the trap . " No , 1 wo n't tell you . I wo n't help overthrow the legitimate government of Xanth . " " Legitimacy is commonly defined after the fact , " Trent remarked . " Had I been successful twenty years ago , I would now be the legitimate King , and the pres/ent monarch would be a reviled outcast noted for frowning people irresponsibly . I presume the Storm King still governs ? " " Yes , " Bink said shortly . The Evil Magician might try to convince him that it all was merely palace politics , but he knew better . " I am , prepared to make you a very handsome offer , Bink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , authority , women  --  " He had said the wrong thing . Bink turned away . He would not want Sabrina on that basis anyway , and he had already turned down what amounted to a similar offer by the Sorceress Iris . Trent steepled his fingers . Even in that minor mannerismthere was implied power and ruthlessness . The Magician 's plans were too finely meshed to be balked by a willful exile . " You may wonder why I choose to return to Xanth , after two decades and evident success in Mundania . I have spent some time analyzing that myself . " " No , " Bink said . But the man only smiled , refusing to be ruffled , and again Bink had the uneasy feeling that he was being skillfully maneuvered , that he was about to play into the hands of the Magician no matter how he tried to fight it . " You should wonder , lest you allow your outlook to he unconscionably narrow  --  as mine was when I emerged from Xanth . Every young man should go abroad into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two at least ; it would make him a better citizen of Xanth . Travel of any type tends to broaden one . " Bink could not argue with that ; he had learned a great deal in his two-week tour of Xanth . How much more would a year in Mundania teach him ? " In fact , " the Magician continued , " when I assume power I shall institute such a policy . Xanth can not prosper cut off from the real world ; in isolation is only stagnation . " Bink could not restrain his morbid curiosity . The Magician had intelligence and experience that appealedp164insidiously to Bink 's own intellect . " What is it like out there ? " " Do not speak with such distaste , young man . Mundaniais not the evil place you may imagine . That is part of the reason the citizens of Xanth need more exposure to it ; the ignorance of isolation breeds unwarranted hostility . Mundania is in many respects more advanced , more civilized than Xanth . Deprived of the benefits of magic , the Mundanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to philosophy , medicine , and science . They now have weapons called guns that can kill more readily than an arrow or even a deadly spell ; I have trained my troops in other weapons , because I do not wish to introduce guns into Xanth . They have carriages that carry them across the land as fast as a unicorn can run , and boats that row across the sea as swiftly as a sea serpent can swim , and balloons that take them as high in the air as a dragon can fly . They have people called doctors who heal the sick and wounded without the use of a single spell , and a device consisting of little beads on columns that multiplies figures with marvelous speed and accuracy . " " Ludicrous ! " Bink said . " Even magic ca n't do figuresfor a person , unless it is a golem , and then it has really become a person . " " This is what I mean , Bink . Magic is marvelous , but it is also limited . In the long run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably the basic life style of the Mundanes is more comfortable than that of many Xanths . " " There probably are n't as many of them , " Bink muttered . " So they have no competition for good land . " " On the contrary . There are many millions of people there . " " You 're never going to convince me of anything , tellingsuch tall stories , " Bink pointed out . " The North Villageof Xanth has about five hundred people , counting all the children , and that 's the largest one . There ca n't be more than two thousand people in the whole king/dom . You talk of thousands of thousands of people , but know the Mundane world ca n't be much larger thanXanth ! " The Evil Magician shook his head in mock sadness . " Bink , Bink ! None so blind as those who will not see . " " And if they really have balloons flying through the air , carrying people , why have n't they flown them over Xanth ? " Bink demanded hotly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because they do n't know where Xanth is  --  do n't ven believe it exists . They do n't believe in magic , so  --  " " Do n't believe in magic ! " The humor had never seen very funny , and it was getting worse . " The Mundanes never did know very much about magic , " Trent said seriously . " It appears a great deal in their literature , but never in their daily lives . The Shield has closed off the border , as it were , so no truly magic animal has been seen in Mundania in about a century . And it may be to our interest to keep them ignorant , " he continued , frowning . " If they ever get the notion Xanth is a threat to them , they might use a giant catapultto lob in firebombs  --  " He broke off , shaking his head as though at some horrible thought . Bink had to admire the perfection of the mannerism , which was as apt as any his father , Roland , employed . He could almostbelieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Magician concluded , " the location of Xanth must remain secret  --  for now . " " It wo n't remain secret if you send all Xanth youths out into Mundania for two years . " " Oh , we would put an amnesia spell on them first , and revoke it only after they returned . Or at least a geis of silence , so no Mundane could learn from them about Xanth . Thus they would acquire Mundane experienceto augment their Xanth magic . Some trusted ones would be permitted to retain their memories and freedom of speech Outside , so they could act as liaisons , recruiting qualified colonists and keeping us informed . For our own safety and progress . But overall  --  "  | " The Fourth Wave again , " Bink said . " Controlled colonization . " Trent smiled . " You are an apt pupil . Many citizens choose not to comprehend the true nature of the originalcolonizations of Xanth . Actually , Xanth never was very easy to locate from Mundania , because it seems to have no fixed geographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the world , always walking across the land bridge directly from their own countries  --  and all would have sworn that they migrated only a few miles . Furthermore , all comprehended one another 's speech in Xanth , though their original languageswere entirely different . So it would appear that there is something magical about the approach to Xanth . Had I not kept meticulous notes of my route , I would never have found my way back this far . The Mundane legends of the animals that departed from Xanth in bygone centuries show that they appeared all over the world , rather than at any specific site . So it seems to work in reverse , too . " He shook his head as if it were a great mystery  --  and Bink was hard put to it not to become hopelessly intrigued by the concept . How could Xanth be everywhere at once ? Did its magic extend , after all , beyond the peninsula , in some peculiar fashion ? It would be easy to get hooked by the prob-lem ! " If you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into Xanth ? " Bink demanded , trying to distracthimself from temptation by focusing on the Magician'scontradictions . " I do n't like Mundania , " Trent said , frowning . " I merely point out that it is not evil , and that it has considerablepotential and must be reckoned with . If we do not keep aware of it , it may become aware of us  --  and that could destroy us . Right along with itself . Xanth represents a haven , like none other known to man . A provincial , backward haven , to be sure  --  but there is no other place quite like it . And I  --  I am a Magician . I belong in my land , with my people , protecting themp167from the horrors arising , which you are not equipped even to imagine . . . . " He lapsed into silence . " Well , no Mundane tales are going to make me tell you how to get into Xanth , " Bink said firmly . The Magician 's eyes focused on Bink as if only now was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer not to have to employ coercion , " Trent said softly . " You know my talent . " Bink felt a shiver of extremely ugly apprehension . Trent was the transformer  --  the one who changed men into trees  --  or worse . The most potent Magician of the past generation  --  too dangerous to be allowed to remain in Xanth . Then he felt relief . " You 're bluffing , " he said . " Your magic ca n't work outside Xanth  --  and I 'm not going to let you into Xanth . " " It is not very much of a bluff , " Trent said evenly . " The magic , as I mentioned , extends slightly beyond the Shield . I can take you to that border and transform you into a toad . And I shall do it  --  if I have to . " Bink 's relief tightened back into a knot in his stomach . Transformation  --  the notion of losing his lifelong body without actually dying had an insidious horror . It terrified him . But he still could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , his tongue feeling thick in his mouth . " I do n't understand , Bink . You surely did not leave Xanth voluntarily . I offer you the chance to get your own back . " " Not that way . " Trent sighed , with seemingly genuine regret . " You are loyal to your principles , and I can not fault you for that . I had hoped it would not come to this . " Bink had hoped so too . But he seemed to have no choice . Except to watch his chance to make a break for it , risking his life to escape . Better a clean death in combatthan to become a toad . A soldier entered , reminding Bink faintly of Crom-bie  --  mainlya matter of bearing , not appearance  --  andp168stood at attention . " What is it , Hastings ? " Trent in-*uired mildly . " Sir , there is another person through the Shield . " Trent hardly showed his elation . " Really ? It seems we have another source of information . " Bink felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were another exile from Xanth , the Magiciancould get his information without Bink 's help . Would he let Bink go  --  or turn him into a toad anyway , as an object lesson ? Remembering Trent 's reputation of past times , Bink had little confidence that he would be freed . Anyone who balked the Evil Magician , in whatevertrifling manner , was in for it . Unless Bink gave him the information now , redeeminghimself . Should he ? Since it could make no difference to the future of Xanth . . . He saw Trent pausing , looking at him expectantly . Suddenly Bink caught on . This was a setup , a fake announcement , to make him talk . And he had almost fallen for it . " Well , you wo n't be needing me , then , " Bink said . One thing about being turned into a toad  --  he could n't tell the Magician anything at all in that form . He imagined a potential dialogue between man and toad : MAGICIAN : Where is the Shieldstone ? TOAD : Croak ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a last resort . Now Trent returned to the messenger . " Bring the other one here ; I will question him immediately . " " Sir  --  it is a woman . " A woman ! Trent seemed mildly surprised , but Bink was amazed . This was not what he expected in a bluff . There was certainly no woman being exiled  --  and no man either . What was Trent trying to do ? Unless  --  oh , no !  --  unless Sabrina had after all followed him out . Dismay tore at him . If the Evil Magician had her in his power  --   |p169No  ! It could not be . Sabrina did not really love him ; the exile and her reaction to it had proved that . She would not give up all she had to follow him out . It simplywas not in her nature . And he did n't really love her ; he had already decided that . So this had to be a complexruse on the part of the Magician . " Very well , " Trent said . " Bring her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . Not if they actually brought her in . And if it were Sabrina  --  it could n't be , he was quite absolutely positively certain of that  --  or was he projecting , attributing his own attitudes to her ? How could he really know what was in her heart ? If she had followed him , he could n't let her be changed into a toad . Yet with all of Xanth at stakeBink threw up his hands , mentally . He would just have to play-it as it came . If they had Sabrina , he was lost ; if it were an ingenious bluff , he had won . Except that he would be a toad . Perhaps being a toad would not be so bad . No doubt flies would taste very good , and the lady toads would look as good as human girls did now . Maybe the great love of his life was waiting in the grass , warts and all .. . The ambush detail arrived , half carrying a struggling woman . Bink saw with relief that it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen before . Her hair was wild , her teeth gnarled , her body sexually shapeless . " Stand , " Trent said mildly , and she stood , responsive to his easy air of command . " Your name ? " " Fanchon , " she said rebelliously . " Yours ? " " The Magician Trent . " " Never heard of you . " Bink , caught by surprise , had to cough to conceal his snort of laughter . But Trent was unperturbed . " This puts us on an even footing , Fanchon . I regret the inconveniencemy men have caused you . If you will kindly inform me of the location of the Shieldstone , I shall pay you well and send you on your way . "  | " Do n't tell him ! " Bink cried . " He means to invade Xanth . " She wrinkled her bulbous nose . " What do I care about Xanth ? " She squinted at Trent . " I could tell you  --  but how do I know I can trust you ? You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trent tapped his long , aristocratic fingers together . " This is a legitimate concern . You have no way of knowing whether my given word is good . Yet it should be obvious that I should bear no malice to those who assist me in the pursuit of my objectives . " " All right , " she said . " Makes sense . The Shieldstone is at  --  " " Traitor ! " Bink screamed . " Remove him , " Trent snapped . Soldiers entered and grabbed him and hustled him out . He had accomplished nothing except to make it harder for himself . But then he thought of another aspect . What were the chances of another exile coming from Xanth within an hour after him ? There could n't be more than one or two exiles a year ; it was big news when anyone left Xanth . He had heard nothing about it , and no second trial had been scheduled . So  --  Fanchon was not an exile . She was probably not from Xanth at all . She was an agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected . Her purpose was to convince Bink that she was telling Trent the location of the Shieldstone , tricking him into confirming it . Well , he had figured out the scheme  --  and so he had won . Do what he might , Trent would not get into Xanth . Yet there was a nagging uncertainty . . .  |p171Bink  was thrown into a pit . A pile of hay broke his fall , and a wooden roof set on four tall posts shaded him from the sun . Other than that , his prison was barren and bleak indeed . The walls were of some stonelike substance , too hard to dig into with his bare hands , too sheer to climb ; the floor was packed earth . He walked around it . The wall was solid all around , and too high for him to surmount . He could almost touch the top when he jumped and reached up  --  but a lattice of metal bars across the top sealed him in . He might , with special effort , get high enough to catch hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be able to do would be to hang there . It might represent exercise , but it would n't get him out . So the cage was tight . He had hardly come to this conclusion before soldiers came to stand at the grate , shaking rust onto him . They stood in the shade of the roof while one of them squatteddown to unlock the little door set in that grate and swing it up and open . Then they dropped a person through . It was the woman Fanchon . Bink jumped across , wrapping his arms around her before she hit the straw , breaking her fall . They both sprawled in the hay . The door slammed shut , and the lock clicked . " Now , I know my beauty did n't overwhelm you , " she remarked as they disentangled . " I was afraid you 'd break a leg , " Bink said defensively . " I almost did , when they threw me in here . " She glanced down at her knobby knees , showing be/heath her dull skirt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not far off the mark . Bink had never seen a more homely girl than this one . But what was she doing here ? Why should the Evil Magician throw his stooge in the den with his prisoner ? This was no way to trick the captive into talking . The proper procedure would be to tell Bink she had talked , and offer him his freedom for confirming the information . Even if she were genuine , she still should not have been confined with him ; she could have been imprisonedseparately . Then the guards would tell each one that the other had talked . Now , if she had been beautiful , they might have thought she could vamp him into telling . But as she was , not a chance . It just did n't seem to make sense . " Why did n't you tell him about the Shieldstone ? " Bink inquired , not certain with what irony he intended it . If she were a fake , she could not have told  --  but she also should not have been dumped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal to Xanth . But then , why had she said she would tell Trent where the Shieldstonewas ? " I told him , " she said . She had told him ? Now Bink hoped she was phony . " Yes , " she said , looking him straight in the eye . " I told him how it was set under the throne in the King 's palace in the North Village . " Bink tried to assess the ramifications of this statement . It was the wrong location  --  but did she know this ? Or was she trying to trick him into a reaction , a revelation of its real location  --  while the guards listened ? Or was she a true exile , who knew the location and had lied about it ? That would account for Trent 's reaction . Because if Trent 's catapult lobbed an elixir bomb on the palace of Xanth , not only would it fail to disrupt the Shield , it would alert the King  --  or at least the more alert ministers , who were not fools  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic in that vicinity would quickly give it away . Had Trent actually lobbed his bomb  --  and had he now lost all hope of penetrating Xanth ? The moment he threat was known , they would move the Shieldstoneto a new , secret location , so that no information from exiles would be valid . No  --  if that had happened , Trent would have turned Fanchon into a toad and stepped on her  --  and he would not have bothered to keep Bink prisoner . Bink might have been killed or released , but not simply kept . So nothing that drastic had happened . Anyway , there had not been time for all that . " I see you do n't trust me , " Fanchon said . A fair analysis . " I ca n't afford to , " he admitted . " I do n't want anything to happen to Xanth . " " Why should you care , since you got kicked out ? " " I knew the rule ; I was given a fair hearing . " " Fair hearing ! " she exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's note or taste the water from the Spring of Life . " Bink paused again . How would she know that ? " Oh , come on , " she said . " I passed through your villageonly hours after your trial . It was the talk of the town . How the Magician Hnmfrey had authenticated your magic , but the King  --  " " Okay , okay , " Bink said . Obviously she had come from Xanth , but he still was n't sure how far he could trust her. , Yet she must know the Shieldstone 's location  --  and had n't told it . Unless she had told it  --  and Trent did n't believe her , so was waiting for corroborationfrom Bink ? But she had announced the wrong location ; no purpose in that , regardless . Bink could challengeher on it , but that would still not give away the right location ; there were a thousand potential spots . So probably she meant what she said : she had tried to fool Trent , and had not succeeded . So the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Xanth and she had not betrayed it . That was what the available evidence suggested . Howp174complex could Trent 's machinations become ? Maybe he had a Mundane machine that could somehow pick up news from inside the Shield . Or  --  more likely !  --  he had a magic mirror set up in the magic zone just outside the Shield , so he could learn interior news . No  --  in that case he could have ascertained the location of the Shieldstone directly . Bink felt dizzy . He did n't know what to think  --  but he certainly was n't going to mention the key location . " I was n't exiled , if that 's what you 're thinking , " Fanchonsaid . " They do n't yet ban people for being ugly . I emigrated voluntarily . " " Voluntarily ? Why ? " " Well , I had two reasons . " " What two reasons ? " She looked at him . " I 'm afraid you would not believe either one . " " Try me and see . " " First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my problem . " " What problem ? " Bink was hardly in a good mood . She gave him another straight look that amounted to a stare . " Must I spell it out ? " Bink found himself reddening . Obviously her problemwas her appearance . Fanchon was a young woman , but she was not plain , not homely , but ugly  --  the living proof that youth and health were not necessarily beauty . No clothing , no makeup could help her nearly enough ; only magic could do it . Which seemed to make her departurefrom Xanth nonsensical . Was her judgment as warped as her body ? Faced with the social necessity of changing the subject , he fixed on another objection , an aspect of his thought : " But there 's no magic in Mundania . " " Precisely . " Again his logic stumbled . Fanchon was as difficult to talk with as to look at . " You mean  --  magic makes you  --  what you are ? " What a marvel of tact he demon-strated !  |p175But  she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , more or less . " " Why did n't Humfrey charge you  --  his fee ? " " He could n't stand the sight of me . " Worse and worse . " Uh  --  what was your other reason for leaving Xanth ? " " That I shall not tell you at this time . " It figured . She had said he would n't believe her reasons , and he had believed the first one , so she would n't tell him the other . Typically female logic . " Well , we seem to be prisoners together , " Bink said , glancing around the pit again . It remained as dismal as ever . " Do you think they 're going to feed us ? " " Certainly , " Fanchon said . " Trent will come around and dangle bread and water at us , and ask which one would like to give him the information . That one will be fed . It will become increasingly difficult to turn him down as time passes . " " You have a gruesomely quick comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " In fact , it is fair to say I am as smart as I am ugly . " Yes indeed . " Are you smart enough to figure out how to get out of here ? " " No , I do n't think escape is possible , " she said , shaking her head in a definite yes . " Oh , " Bink said , taken aback . Her words said no , her gesture said yes . Was she crazy ? No  --  she knew the guards were listening , though they were out of sight . So she sent them one message while sending Bink another . Which meant she had figured out an escape already . It was now afternoon . A shaft of sunlight spilled through the grate , finding its route past the edge of the rof . Just as well , Bink thought ; it would get unbearablydank in here if the sun never reached the bottom . 11Trent came to the grate . " I trust you two have made your acquaintance ? " he said pleasantly . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanchon muttered . " I apologize for the inconvenience of your quarters , "  |p176Trent  said , squatting down with perfect aplomb . It was 11 as if he were meeting them in a clean office . " If you both will give me your word not to depart these premises or interfere with our activities in any way , I shall arrange a comfortable tent for you . " " Therein lies subversion , " Fanchon said to Bink . " Once you start accepting favors , you become obligated . Do n't do it . " She was making extraordinary sense . " No deal , " Bink said . " You see , " Trent continued smoothly , " if you were in a tent and you tried to escape , my guards would have to put arrows in you  --  and I do n't want that to happen . It would be most uncomfortable for you , and would imperilmy source of information . So it is vital that I have you confined by one means or another . By word or bond , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You could always let us go , " Bink said . " Since you are n't going to get the information anyway . " If that ruffled the Evil Magician , he did not show it . " Here is some cake and wine , " Trent said , lowering a package on a cord . Neither Bink nor Fanchon reached for it , though Bink suddenly felt hungry and thirsty . The odors of spice wafted through the pit temptingly ; obviously the package contained fresh , good things . " Please take it , " Trent said . " I assure you it is neither poisoned nor drugged . I want you both in good health . " " For when you change us into toads ? " Bink asked loudly . What did he have to lose , really ? " No , I am afraid you have called my bluff on that . Toads do not speak intelligibly  --  and it is important to me that you speak . " Could the Evil Magician have lost his talent in the course of his long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package touched the straw . Fanchon shrugged and squatted , untying it . Sure enough  --  cake and wine.  | " Maybe one of us better eat now , " she said . " If nothing happens in a few hours , the other eats . " " Ladies first , " Bink said . If the food were drugged nd she were a spy , she would n't touch it . " Thank you . " She broke the cake in half . " Pick a piece , " she said . " You eat that one , " Bink said , pointing . " Very nice , " Trent said from above . " You trust neiherme nor each other . So you are working out conventionsto safeguard your interests . But it really is unnecessary ; if I wanted to poison either of you , I would merely pour it on your heads . " Fanchon took a bite of cake . " This is very good , " she said . She uncorked the wine and took a swig . " This too . " But Bink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been considering your cases , " Trent said . " Fanchon , I will be direct . I can transform you into any other life form  --  even another human being . " He squinted down at her . " How would you like to be beau-tiful ? " Uh-oh . If Fanchon were nota spy , this would be a compelling offer . The ugly one converted to beauty " Go away , " Fanchon said to Trent , " before I throw a mudball at you . " But then she thought of something else . " If you 're really going to leave us here , at least give us some sanitary facilities . A bucket and a curtain . If I had a lovely posterior I might not mind the lack of privacy , but as it is I prefer to be modest . " " Aptly expressed , " Trent said . He gestured , and the guards brought the items and lowered them through the hole in the grate . Fanchon set the pot in one corner and removed pins from her straggly hair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangular chamber . Bink was n't sure why a girl of her appearance should affect such modesty ; surely no one would gawk at her exposed flesh regardless of its rondure . Unless she really was extremelysensitive , with her remarks making light of what remained a serious preoccupation . In that case it didp178make sense . A pretty girl could express shock and distressif someone saw her bare torso , but privately she would be pleased if the reaction were favorable . Fanchonhad no such pretense . Bink was sorry for her , and for himself ; it would have made the confinement much more interesting if his companion had been scenic . But actually he was grateful for the privacy , too . Natural functions would otherwise have been awkward . So he was full circle ; she had defined the problem before he ever started thinking it out . She obviously did have a quicker mind . " He 's not fooling about making you beautiful , " Bink said . " He can  --  " " It would n't work . " " No , Trent 's talent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my problem  --  even if I were willing to betray Xanth . " This was strange . She did not want beauty ? Then why her extraordinary sensitivity about her appearance ? Or was this some other ploy to get him to tell the location of the Shieldstone ? He doubted it . She obviously was from Xanth ; no Outsider could have guessed t about his experience ' with the water of the Spring of Life and the senile King . Time passed . Evening came . Fanchon suffered no ill effects , so Bink ate and drank his share of the meal . At dusk it rained . The water poured through the lattice ; the roof provided some shelter , but enough slanted in to wet them down thoroughly anyway . But Fanchon smiled . " Good , " she whispered . " The fates are with us tonight . " Good ? Bink shivered in his wet clothing , and watched her wonderingly . She scraped with her fingers in the softening floor of the pit . Bink walked over to see what she was up to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards do n't se , " she whispered . Small danger of that ; the guards were n't interested . They had taken shelter from the rain , and were not inp179sight . Even if they had been close , it was getting too dark to see . What was so important about this business ? She was scooping out mud from the floor and mixing it with the hay , heedless of the rain . Bink could n't make any sense of it . Was this her way of relaxing ? " Did you know any girls in Xanth ? " Fanchon inquired . The rain was slacking off , but the darkness protectedher secret work-from Bink 's comprehension as well as that of the guards . It was a subject Bink would have preferred to avoid . " I do n't see what  --  " She moved over to him . " I 'm making bricks , idiot ! " she whispered fiercely . " Keep talking  --  and watch for any lights . If you see anyone coming , say the word ' chameleon . ' I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to her corner . Chameleon . There was something about that word  --  now he had it . The chameleon lizard he had seen just before starting on his quest to the Good Magician  --  his omen of the future . The chameleon had died abruptly . Did this mean his time was come ? " Talk ! " Fanchon urged . " Cover my sounds ! " Then , In conversational tone : " You did know some girls ? " " Uh , some , " Bink said . Bricks ? What for ? " Were they pretty ? " Her hands were blurred by the night , but he could hear the little slaps of mud and rustleof hay . She could be using the hay to contribute fiberto the mud brick . But the whole thing was crazy . Did she intend to build a brick privy ? " Or not so pretty ? " she prompted him . " Oh . Pretty , " he said . It seemed he was stuck with this topic . If the guards were listening , they would pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her slapping mud . Well , if that was what she wanted  --  " My fiancee , Sabrina , was beautiful  --  is beautiful  --  and the Sorceress Iris seemed beautiful , but I met others who were n't . Once they get old or married , they  --  "  |p180The  rain had abated . Bink saw a light approaching . " Chameleon , " he murmured , again experiencing inner tension . Omens always were accurate  --  if understood correctly . " Women do n't have to get ugly when they marry , " Fanchon said . The sounds had changed ; now she was concealing the evidence . " Some start out that way . " She certainly was conscious of her condition . This made him wonder again why she had turned downTrent 's offer of beauty . " I met a lady centaur on my way to the Magician Humfrey , " Bink said , finding itdifficult to concentrate even on so natural a subject as this in the face of the oddities of his situation . Impris- oned in a pit with an ugly girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a statuesque kind of way Of course she was basically a horse  --  " Bad terminol- ogy . " I mean , from the rear she  --  well , I rode her back  --  " Conscious of what the guards might think was saying  --  not that he should even care what they thought  --  he eyed the approaching light . He saw it mainly by reflections from the bars . " You know , shewas half equine . She gave me a ride through centaur country . " The light diminished . It must be a guard on routinepatrol . " False alarm , " he whispered . Then , in conversa- tional tone : " But there was one really lovely girl on the way to the Magician . She was  --  her name was . . . " He paused to concentrate . " Wynne . But she was abysmally stupid . I hope the Gap dragon did n't catch her . " " You were in the Gap ? " " For a while . Until the dragon chased me off . I had to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I had thought there was a forget spell associated with it , be- cause it was not on my map and I never heard of it untilI encountered it . Though how it is that I remember it , in that case  --  " " I lived near the Gap , " she said . " You lived there ? When was it made ? What is its se-cret ? "  | " It was always there . There is a forget spell  --  I think the Magician Humfrey put it there . But if your associationsare really strong , you remember . At least for a while . Magic only goes so far . " " Maybe that 's it . I 'll never forget my experience with the dragon and the shade . " Fanchon was making bricks again . " Any other girls ? " Bink had the impression she had more than casual interest in the matter . Was it because she knew the people of the chasm region ? " Let 's see  --  there was one Other I met . An ordinary girl . Dee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Crombie . He was awoman-hater , or at least professed to be , and shewalked out . Too bad ; I rather liked her . " " Oh ? I thought you preferred pretty girls . " " Look  --  do n't he so damned sensitive ! " he snapped . " You brought up the subject . I liked Dee better thanoh , never mind . I 'd have been happier talking about plans to escape . " " Sorry , " she said . " I  --  I knew about your journey around the chasm . Wynne and Dee are  --  friends of mine . So naturally I 'm concerned . " " Friends of yours ? Both of them ? " Pieces of a puzzlebegan to fit together . " What is your association with the Sorceress Iris ? " Fanchon laughed . " None at all . If I were the Sorceress , do you think I would look like this ? " " Yes , " Bink said . " If you tried beauty and it didn'twork , and you still wanted power and figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would explain why Trent could n't tempt you with thepromise of beauty . That would only ruin your coverand you could be beautiful any time you wanted to be . So you might follow me out in a disguise nobody would suspect , and of course you would not help another Magiciantake over Xanth  --  " " So I 'd come right out here into Mundania , where there is no magic , " she finished . " Therefore no illu-sion. "  |p182That  gutted his case . Or did it ? " Maybe this is the way you actually look ; I may never have seen the real Iris , there on her island . " " And how would I get back into Xanth ? " For that Bink had no answer . He responded with bluster . " Well , why did you come here ? Obviously the nonmagic aspect has not solved your problem . " " Well , it takes time  --  " " Time to cancel out magic ? " " Certainly . When dragons used to fly out over Mundania , before the Shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fade . Maybe even longer . Magician Humfrey says there are many pictures and descriptions of dragons and other magic beasts in Mundane texts . The Mundanes do n't see dragons any more , so they think the old texts are fantasy  --  but this proves that ittakes a while for the magic in a creature or person todissipate . " " So a Sorceress could retain her illusion for a few days after all , " Bink said . She sighed . " Maybe so . But I 'm not Iris , though Icertainly would n't mind being her . I had entirely differ- ent and compelling reasons to leave Xanth . " " Yes , I remember . One was to lose your magic , whatever it was , and the other you would n't tell me . " " I suppose you deserve to know . You 're going tohave it out of me one way or another . I learned from Wynne and Dee what sort of a person you were , and- " " So Wynne did get away from the dragon ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light was coming . " Chameleon , " Bink said . Fanchon scrambled to hide her bricks . This time the light came all the way to the pit . " I trust you have not been flooded out down there ? " Trent 's voice inquired . " If we were , we 'd swim away from here , " Bink said . " Listen , Magician  --  the more uncomfortable you makeus , the less we want to help you . " " I am keenly aware of that , Bink . I would much pre- fer to provide you with a comfortable tent  --  "  | " No . " " Bink , I find it difficult to comprehend why you A should be so loyal to a government that treated you so shabbily . " " What do you know about that ? " " My spies have of course been monitoring your dialogues . But I could have guessed it readily enough , knowing how old and stubborn the Storm King must be by now . Magic manifests in divers forms , and when the definitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make any difference here . " The Magician persisted , sounding quite reasonable in contrast to Bink 's unreason . " It may be that you do lack magic , Bink , though I hardly think Humfrey would be wrong about a thing like that . But you have other qualitiesto recommend you , and you would make an excellentcitizen . " " He 's right , you know , " Fanchon said . " You do deservebetter than you were given . " " Which side are you on ? " Bink demanded . She sighed in the dark . She sounded very human ; it was easier to appreciate that quality when he could n't see her . " I 'm on your side , Bink . I admire your loyalty ; I 'm just not sure it 's deserved . " " Why do n't you tell him where the Shieldstone is , ' then  --  if you know it ? " " Because , with all its faults , Xanth remains a nice place . The senile King wo n't live forever ; when he dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'll make things much better , even if he does complain about the time it 's wasting him . Maybe some new or young Magician is being born right now , to take over after that . It 'll work out somehow . It always has before . The last thing Xanth needs is to be taken over by a cruel , Evil Magician who would turn all his opposition into turnips . " Trent 's chuckle came down from above . " My dear , you have a keen mind and a sharp tongue . Actually , Ip184prefer to turn my opponents into trees ; they are more durable than turnips . I do n't suppose you could concede , merely for the sake of argument , that I might , make a better ruler than the present King ? " " He 's got a point , you know , " Bink said , smiling cynicallyin the dark . " Which side are you on ? " Fanchon demanded , mimickingthe tone Bink had used before . But it was Trent who laughed . " I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . You have good minds and good loyalty . If you would only give that loyalty to me , I would be prepared to make substantial concessions . For example , I might grant you veto power over any transformationsI made . You could thus choose the turnips . " " So we 'd be responsible for your crimes , " Fanchon said . " That sort of power would be bound to corrupt us very soon , until we were no different from you . " " Only if your basic fiber were not superior to mine , " Trent pointed out . " And if it were not , then you would never have been any different from me . You merely have not yet been subjected to my situation . It would be best if you discovered this , so as not to be unconscious hypocrites . " Bink hesitated . He was wet and cold , and he did not relish spending the night in this hole . Had Trent been one to keep his word , twenty years ago ? No , he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power That was part of what had defeated him ; no one could afford to trust him , not even his friends . The Magician 's promises were valueless . His logic was a tissue of rationalization , designed only to get one of the prisoners to divulge the location of the Shield stone . Veto power over transformations ? Bink and Fanchonwould be the first to be transformed , once the Evii one had no further need of them . Bink did not reply . Fanchon remained silent . After moment Trent departed . " And so we weather temptation number two , " Fanp185chon remarked . " But he 's a clever and unscrupulous man ; it will get harder . " Bink was afraid she was right . Next morning the slanting sunlight baked the crude bricks . They were hardly hard yet , but at least it was a start . Fanchon placed the items in the privacy cubicle so that they could not be seen from above . She would set them out again for the afternoon sun , if all went well . Trent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I dislike putting it on this footing , " he said , " but my patience is wearing thin . At any time they might move the Shieldstone routinely , rendering your information valueless . If one of you does not give me the information need today , tomorrow I shall transform you both . You , Bink , will be a cockatrice ; you , Fanchon , a basilisk . You will be confined in the same cage . " Bink and Fanchon looked at each other with completedismay . Cockatrice and basilisk  --  two names for the same thing : a winged reptile hatched from a yolklessegg laid by a rooster and hatched by a toad in the warmth of a dungheap . The stench , of its breath was so bad that it wilted vegetation and shattered stone , and the very sight of its face would cause other creatures to keel over dead . Basilisk  --  the little king of the reptiles . The chameleon of his omen had metamorphosed into the likeness of a basilisk  --  just before it died . Now he bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have known about that omen , and threatened with transformation into  --  Surely death was drawing nigh . " It 's a bluff , " Fanchon said at last . " He ca n't really do it . He 's just trying to scare us . " " He 's succeeding , " Bink muttered . " Perhaps a demonstration would be in order , " Trent said . " I ask no person to take my magic on faith , when It is so readily demonstrable . It is necessary for me to perform regularly , to restore my full talent after the long layoff in Mundania , so the demonstration is quitep186convenient for me . " He snapped his fingers . " Allow the prisoners to finish their meal , " he said to the guard who reported . " Then remove them from the cell . " He left . Now Fanchon was glum for another reason . " He may be bluffing  --  but if they come down in here , they 'll find the bricks . That will finish us anyway . " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bink said . " They wo n't come down here unless they have to . " " Let 's hope so , " she said . When the guards came , Bink and Fanchon scrambled up the rope ladder the moment it was dropped . " We 're calling the Magician 's bluff , " Bink said . There was no reaction from the soldiers . The party marched eastward across the isthmus , toward Xanth . Within sight of the Shield , Trent stood beside a wire cage . Soldiers stood in a ring around him , arrows nocked to bows . They all wore smoked glasses . It looked very grim . " Now I caution you , " Trent said as they arrived . " Do not look directly at each other 's faces after the transformation . I can not restore the dead to life . " If this were another scare tactic , it was effective . Fanchonmight doubt , but Bink believed . He remembered Justin Tree , legacy of Trent 's ire of twenty years ago . The omen loomed large in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die . . . Trent caught Bink 's look of apprehension . " Have you anything to say to me ? " he inquired , as if routinely . " Yes . How did they manage to exile you without gettingturned into toads or turnips or worse ? " Trent frowned . " That was not precisely what I meant , Bink . But , in the interest of harmony , I will answer . An aide I trusted was bribed to put a sleep spell on me . While I slept , they carried me across the Shield . " " How do you know it wo n't happen again ? You ca n't stay awake all the time , you know . " " I spent much time pondering that whole problem inp187he long early years of my exile . I concluded that I had Brought the deception upon myself . I had been faithlessothers , and so others were faithless ' to me . I was notentirely without honor ; I breached my given word onlyor what I deemed to be sufficient cause , yet  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I did not think so at the time . But I dare say my reputation in that respect did not improve in my abscence ; it is ever the privilege of the victor to present the poser as completely corrupt , thus justifying the victory . Nevertheless , my word was not my absolute bond , and in time I realized that this was the fundamental flaw in my character that had been my undoing . The only way to prevent repetition was to change my own mode of operation . And so I no longer deceive  --  ever . And no one deceives me . " It was a fair answer . The Evil Magician was , in many respects , the opposite of the popular image ; instead of being ugly , weak , and mean  --  Humfrey fitted that descriptionbetter  --  he was handsome , strong , and urbane . Yet he was the villain , and Bink knew better than to let fair words deceive him . " Fanchon , stand forth , " Trent said . Fanchon stepped toward him , open cynicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He merely glanced at her with concentration . She vanished . A soldier swooped in with a butterfly net , slamming it down on something . In a moment he held it up  --  a struggling , baleful , lizardlike thing with wings . It really was a basilisk ! Bink quickly averted his eyes , lest he look directly at its horrible face and meet its deadly gaze . The soldier dumped the thing into the cage , and **28;3904;TOOLONG soldier shoved on the lid . The remaining soldiers relaxed visibly . The basilisk scrambled around , seeking some escape , but there was none . It glared at the wire confinement , but its gaze had no effect on the metal . A third soldier dropped a clothp188over the cage , cutting off the view of the little monster . Now Bink himself relaxed . The whole thing had ob- ' I viously been carefully prepared and rehearsed ; the soldiersknew exactly what to do . " Bink , stand forth , " Trent said , exactly as before . Bink was terrified . But a corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's in on it . They have rigged it to make me think she was transformed , and that I 'm to be next . All her arguments against Trent were merely to make her seem legitimate , preparing for this moment . Still , he only half believed that . The omen lent it a special , awful conviction . Death hovered , as it were , on the silent wings of a moth hawk , close . . . Yet he could not betray his homeland . Weak-kneed , he stepped forth . Trent focused on him  --  and the world jumped . Confusedand frightened , Bink scrambled for the safety of a nearby bush . The green leaves withered as he approached ; then the net came down , trapping him . Rememberinghis escape from the Gap dragon , he dodged at the last moment , backtracking , and the net just missed him . He glared up at the soldier , who , startled , had allowed his smoked glasses to fall askew . Their gazes met  --  and the man tumbled backward , stricken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Bink scooted for the withered bush again , but this time the net caught him . He was scooped inside , wings flapping helplessly , tail thrashing and getting its barb caught in the fabric , claws snarled , beak snappingat nothing . Then he was dumped out . Two shakes , three , and his claws and tail were dislodged . He landed on his back , wings outspread . An anguished squawk escaped him . As he righted himself , the light dimmed . He was in the cage , and it had just been covered , so that no one outside could see his face . He was a cockatrice . Some demonstration ! Not only had he seen Fanchon transformed , he had experienced it himself  --  and killedp189a soldier merely by looking at him . If there had been any skeptics in Trent 's army , there would be none now . He saw the curling , barbed tail of another of his kind . A female . But her back was to him . His cockatrice naturetook over . He did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging in with his talons . She twisted around instantly , the muscular serpent'stail providing leverage . For a moment they were face to face . She was hideous , frightful , loathsome , ghastly , and revolting . He had never before experienced anything so repulsive . Yet she was female , and therefore possessed of a certain fundamental attraction . The paradoxical repulsionand attraction overwhelmed him and he lost consciousness . When he woke , he had a headache . He lay on the ti hay in the pit . It was late afternoon . " It seems the stare of the basilisk is overrated , " Fanchonsaid . " Neither of us died . " So it had really happened . " Not quite , " Bink agreed . " But I feel a bit dead . " As he spoke he realized something that had not quite surfaced before : the basilisk was a magical creature that could do magic . He had been an intelligent cockatrice who had magically stricken an enemy . What did that do to his theory of magic ? " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 've already buried that soldier . It is quiet like death in this camp now . " Like death  --  had that been the meaning of his omen ? He had not died , but he had killed  --  without meaning to , in a manner completely foreign to his normal state . Had the omen been fulfilled ? Bink sat up , another realization coming . " Trent 's tal-entis genuine . We were transformed . We really were . " " It is genuine . We really were , " she agreed somberly . " I admit I doubted  --  but now I believe . "  | " He must have changed us back while we were un-conscious . " " Yes . He was only making a demonstration . " " It was an effective one . " " It was . " She shuddered . " Rink  --  I  --  I do n't know whether I can take that again . It was n't just the change . It was  --  " " I know . You made a hell of an ugly basilisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly anything . But the sheer malignancy , stupidity , and awfulness  --  those things are foul ! To spend the rest of my life like that  --  " " I ca n't blame you , " Bink said . But still something magged at his mind . The experience had been so momentousthat he knew it would take a long time for his mind to sift through all its aspects . " I did n't think anyone could make me go against my conscience . But this  --  this  --  " She put her face into her hands . Bink nodded silently . After a moment he shifted the subject . " Did you notice  --  those creatures were male and female . " " Of course , " she said , gaining control of herself now that she had something to orient on . " We are male and female . The Magician can change our forms but not our sexes . " " But the basilisks should be neuter . Hatched of eggs laid by roosters  --  there are no parent basilisks , only roosters . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're right . If there are males and females , they should mate and reproduce their own kind . Which means , by definition , they are n't basilisks . A paradox . " " There must be something wrong with the definition , " Bink said . " Either there 's a lot of superstition about the origins of monsters , or we were not genuine basilisks . " " We were genuine , " she said , grimacing with renewedhorror . " I 'm sure now . For the first time in myp191life , I 'm glad for my human form . " Which was quite an admission , for her . " That means Trent 's magic is all-the-way real , " Bink said . " He does n't just change the form , he really conventsthings into other things , if you see what I mean . " ' Then the thing that had nagged at his mind before came clear . " But if magic fades outside Xanth , beyond the narrow magic band beyond the Shield , all we would have to do  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she exclaimed , catching on . " In time , we would revert to our proper forms . So it would not be permanent . " " So his transformation ability is a bluff , even though it is real , " he said . " He would have to keep us caged right there , or we 'd escape and get out of his power . He has to get all the way into Xanth or he really has verylittle power . No more power than he already has asGeneral of his army  --  the power to kill . " " All he can get now is the tantalizing taste of real power , " she said . " I 'll bet he wants to get into Xanth ! " " But meanwhile , we 're still in his power . " She set out the bricks , catching the limited sunlight . " What are you going to do ? " she asked . " If he lets me go , I 'll travel on into Mundania . That 's where I was headed before I was ambushed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive out there . But I 'll make sure to note my route carefully ; it seems Xanth is hard to find from the other direction . " " I meant about the Shieldstone . " " Nothing . " " You wo n't tell him ? " " No , of course not , " he said . " Now we know his magic ca n't really hurt us worse than his soldiers can , some of the terror is gone . Not that it matters . I do n't blame you for telling him . " She looked at him . Her face was still ugly , but there was something special in it now . " You know , you 're quite a man , Bink. "  | " No , I 'm nothing much . I have no magic . " " You have magic . You just do n't know what it is . " " Same thing . " " I followed you out here , you know . " Her meaning was coming clear . She had heard about him in Xanth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no liability in Mundania . What better match  --  the man with no magic , the woman with no beauty . Similar liabilities . Perhaps he could get used to her appearance in time ; her other qualities were certainlycommendable . Except for one thing . " I understand your position , " he said . " But if you cooperate with the Evil Magician , I wo n't have anything to do with you , even if he makes you beautiful . Not that it matters  --  you can get your reward in Xanth when he takes over , if he honors his given word this time . " " You restore my courage , " she said . " Let 's make a break for it . " " How ? " " The bricks , dummy . They 're hard now . As soon as it 's dark , we 'll make a pile  --  " " The grate keeps us in ; its door is still locked . A step wo n't make any difference . If just getting up there were the only problem , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she murmured . " We pile the bricks , stand on them , and push the whole grate up . It 's not anchored ; I checked that when they brought us in here . Gravity holds it down . It 's heavy , but you 're strong  --  " Bink looked up with sudden hope . " You could prop it up after I heave . Step by step , until  --  " " Not so loud ! " she whispered fiercely . " They may still be eavesdropping . " But she nodded . " You 've got the idea . It 's not a sure thing , but it 's worth a try . And we 'll have to make a raid on the store of elixir , so he ca n't use it even if someone else comes out to tell him where the Shieldstone is . I 've been working it all out . " Bink smiled . He was beginning to like her.  |p193A  t night they piled up the bricks . Some crumbled , for the scant sunlight had not been sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were surprisinglysturdy . Bink listened carefully for the guards , waiting until they took what they called a " break . " Then he stepped to the top of the brick pile , braced his hands against the edge of the grate , and shoved . As his muscles tightened , he suddenly realized that this was Fanchon 's real reason for demanding the privacycurtain of the privy . It had not been to hide her unsightly anatomy , but to hide the bricks  --  so they would be preserved for this moment , this effort to escape . And he had never caught on . The revelation gave him strength . He shoved hard  --  and the grate rose with surprising ease . Fanchon scrambledup beside him and jammed the privy pot under the lifted edge . Ugh ! Maybe some year someone would develop a pot that smelled of roses ! But it did the job . It supported the grate as he eased off . Now there was room to scramble out . Bink gave her a boost , then hauled himself up . No guards saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ship , " Fanchon whispered , pointing into the darkness . " How do you know that ? " Bink asked . " We passed it on our way to the  --  transformation . It 's the only thing that would be guarded so carefully . And you can see the catapult aboard it . "  |p194She  had certainly kept her eyes open . Ugly she might be , but she was smart . He had n't thought to survey the premises with such an analytic eye ! " Now , getting that elixir will be a problem , " she continued . " I think we 'd better take the whole ship . Can 1 you sail ? " " I 've never been on anything bigger than a rowboat in my life , except maybe Iris 's yacht , and that was n't real . I 'd probably get seasick . " " Me too , " she agreed . " We 're landlubbers . So they 'll never look for us there . Come on . " Well , it was better than being changed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . Bink looked back nervously  --  and saw a light moving toward the pit . " Hurry ! " he whispered . " We forgot to put the grate back down ; they 'll know we 're gone right away . " At least they were both reasonably good swimmers . They shed their clothing  --  what had happened to it duringthe transformations ? again , no explaining the details of magic  --  and stroked silently for the sailboat moored a quarter mile out . Bink was alarmed by the dark depths of the water beneath him ; what type of monsters dwelled in Mundane seas ? The water was not cold , and the exertion of swimminghelped warm him , but gradually Bink tired and felt chilled . Fanchon suffered similarly . The ship had not seemed far , viewed from land  --  but that had been walking distance . Swimming distance was quite another matter . Then the hue and cry commenced back at the prison pit . Lights flared everywhere , moving around like fireflies  --  butsetting no fires . Bink had an infusion of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he gasped . Fanchon did n't answer . She was too busy swimming . The swim was interminable . It drained strength from Bink , making him become more pessimistic . But at last they came up to the ship . A sailor was standing on thep195deck , a silhouette in the light of the moon , peering at the shore . Fanchon drew close to Bink . " You go  --  other side , " she gashed . " I  --  distract . " She had guts . The sailor might put an arrow in her . But Bink stroked laboriously around the keel , moving to the far side . The shin was about forty feet long . large by Xanth standards . But if anv part of what Trent had said about Mundania was true , there were much larger ships there . He reached up and put his fingers on the edge of the hull . He tried to think of the name of this portion of a ship 's anatomy , but could not . He hoped there were n't other.sailors watching . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the name  --  so as not to rock the boat . Now Fanchon , with superlative timing , made a clamor , as of someone drowning . The sailors went to the rail  --  four of them in all  --  and Bink heaved himself up as silently as he could . He scraped , for his muscles felt leaden , unresponsive . His wet body slapped against the deck , and the ship tilted back a bit under his weight  --  but the sailors stood riveted to the other side , watching the show . Bink got to his feet and slunk up to the mast . The sails were furled , so that it offered scant concealment ; they would see him when they turned with their lamps . Well , he would have to act first . He felt ill equipped to indulge in combat , his arms and feet cold and heavy , but it was necessary . He walked silently up behind the four , his heart pounding . They were leaning over the rail , trying to see Fanchon , who was still making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the nearest sailor and caught the man 's trouser ith his right hand . He heaved , hard and suddenly  --  d the sailor went up and over with a cry of alarm . Bink swung immediately to the next , grabbing and oving . The man had started to turn toward his cornnion'sexclamation  --  but too late . Bink heaved , andp196the sailor went over . Almost over  --  one hand caught the rail . The sailor clung , twisting around to face inward . i Bink knocked at his fingers and finally pried them ; loose , and the man dropped into the water . But the loss of time and momentum had been crucial . Now the other two were upon Bink . One wrapped an arm around Bink 's shoulder , trying to choke him , while the other hovered behind . What had Crombie said to do in a situation like this ? Bink concentrated and remembered . He grabbed the man , bent his knees , leaned forward , and heaved . It worked beautifully . The sailor sailed over Bink 's shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last one was stepping in , fists swinging . He caught Bink on the side of the head with glancing but numbing force . Bink fell to the deck himself , and the man dove on top of him . To make things worse , Bink saw one of the others climbing back aboard . He put up his feet to hold off his opponent , but this was only partiallyeffective . The burly sailor was pushing him down , pinning him  --  and the other was about to join in . The standing figure lifted a foot . Bink could not even flinch ; his arms were tangled , his body held down . The foot swung  --  and struck the head of Bink 's antagonist . The man rolled off Bink with a groan . It was not fun , being kicked in the head . But how had the kicker missed the proper target , at such close range ? The lamps had all gone into the water along with their owners ; maybe in the dark a mistake " Help me get him over the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure this ship . " And he had mistaken her for a sailor , though she was naked ! Well , blame the inadequate light again . Moonlightwas pretty , but in a situation like thisBut the remaining two sailors were already rising over the gunwale . Acting on a common impulse , Bink grabbed his erstwhile opponent 's shoulders , and Fanchongrabbed his feet . " One  --  two  --  three  --  heave ! " she gasped.  |p197They  heaved almost together . The man swung up and h to his two companions . All three went over the edgesplash in the sea . Bink hoped they were all lively hough to swim . The fourth one lay on the deck , apparitlyunconscious . " Pull up the anchor ! " Fanchon ordered . " I 'll get a pole . " She ran to the ship 's cabin , a lean figure in the moonlight . Bink found the anchor chain and hauled on it . The thing snagged infuriatingly , because he did not know how to make it let go , but finally he got it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanchon demanded , kneeling beside the fallen sailor . " I threw him . Crombie showed me how . " " Crombie ? I do n't remember  --  " " A soldier I met in Xanth . We got caught in a hailstorm , and I was going back after Dee , but  --  well , it 's complicated . " " Oh yes  --  you did mention the soldier . " She paused . " Dee ? You went after her ? Why ? " " She had run out into the storm and  --  well , I liked her . " Then , to cover up what might have been taken as a slight to his present company , who had shown extremesensitivity about such things before , he said : " What happened to the other sailors ? Did they drown ? " " I showed them this , " she said , pointing to a wickedlookingboathook . " They swam for shore instead . " " We 'd better get moving . If we can figure out the sail . " " No . The current is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd just mess it up , trying to handle the ils when we do n't know what we 're doing . " Bink looked across at the other ship . Lights were on " Those sailors did n't swim ashore , " he said . " They ent next door . They 'll be coming after us  --  under it . " " They ca n't , " she said . " I told you  --  the wind . " But now it was unmistakable . The other sail was spread . They were using the wind.  | " We 'd better find that elixir , " she said . " Yes . " He had forgotten about it . But for that , they could have run across the land and been lost in Mundania . But could he have lived with himself , buying his own freedom while leaving Xanth subject to the siege of the Evil Magician ? " We 'll dump it overboard  --  " " No ! " " But I thought  --  " " We 'll use it as hostage . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll take turns standing on the deck and holding the vial over the sea so they can see us . If anything happens to  --  " " Beautiful ! " he exclaimed . " I never would have thought of that . " " First we have to find our hostage . If we guessed wrong about the ship , if they put the catapult on this one and the elixir on the other  --  " " Then they would n't be chasing us , " he said . " Yes they would . They need the catapult too . An most of all , they need us . " They searched the ship . In the cabin was a chaine monster of a type Bink had never seen before . It was not large , but quite horrible in other respects . Its body2 was completely covered with hair , white with black spots , and it had a thin tail , floppy black ears , a small black nose , and gleaming white teeth . Its four feet had stubby claws . It snarled viciously as Bink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , its mad leapt cut brutally short by that tether . J " What is it ? " Bink asked , horrified . Fanchon considered . " I think it 's a werewolf . " Now the creature looked halfway familiar . It did ram semble a werewolf , fixed in its animal stage . " Out here in Mundania ? " " Well , it must be related . If it had more heads , it would be like a cerberus . With only one head , I think it 's a dog . " Bink gaped . " A dog ! I think you 're right . I 've neverp199actually seen a dog before . Not in the flesh . Just pic-tures . " " I do n't think there are any in Xanth today . There sed to be , but they must have migrated out . " " Through the Shield ? " Bink demanded . " Before the Shield was set up , of course  --  though I 'd thought there were references to dogs and cats and horses within the past century . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems we have one here now . It looks vicious . It must be guarding the elixir . " " Trained to attack strangers , " she agreed . " I suppose we 'll have to kill it . " " But it 's a rare creature . Maybe the only one left alive today . " " We do n't know that . Dogs might be common in Mundania . But it is rather pretty , once you get used toit . " The dog had quieted down , though it still watched them warily . A small dragon might watch a person that way , Bink thought , if the person were just outside its striking range . With the proper break , the person might come within range . . . " Maybe we could revive the sailor and have him tame it , " Bink said . " The animal must be responsive to members of this ship 's crew . Otherwise they could never get at the elixir . " " Good idea , " she agreed . The sailor had finally recovered consciousness , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll let you go , " Fanchon told him , " if you tell us how to tame that dog . We do n't want to have to kill it , you see . " " Who , Jennifer ? " the man asked dazedly . " Just speak her name , pat her on the head , and feed her . " He lay back . " I think my collarbone 's broke . " Fanchon looked at Bink . " Ca n't make him swim , then . Trent may be a monster , but we are n't . " She turned back to the sailor . " If you will give your wordp200not to interfere with us in any way , we 'll help you recoveras well as we can . Deal ? " The sailor did n't hesitate . " I ca n't interfere with you . I ca n't get up . Deal . " This bothered Bink . He and Fanchon sounded just . like Trent , offering better terms to a captive enemy in return for his cooperation . Were they any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's body around the shoulders . " Yow ! " he cried . " I 'm no doctor , " she said , " but I think you 're right . You have a broken bone . Are there any pillows aboard ? " " Listen , " the sailor said as she worked on him . He was obviously trying to divert his attention from the pain . " Trent 's no monster . You called him that , but you 're wrong . He 's a good leader . " " He 's promised you all the spoils of Xanth ? " Fanchonasked , with an edge to her voice . " No , just farms or jobs for all of us , " he said . " No killing , no rapine , no loot ? " Her disbelief was evident . " None of that . This ai n't the old days , you know ? We just protect him-and keep order in the territory we oc- cupy , and he 'll give us small land grants where nobody 's settled yet . He says Xanth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local gals to marry us , so we can have families . If there are n't enough , he 'll bring in gals from the real world . And meanwhile , he 'll transformsome smart animals into gals . I thought that was a joke , but after what I hear about those cocks  --  " He grimaced . " I mean those basks  --  " He shook his head and grimaced again , in pain . " Keep your head still , " Fanchon told him , too late . " It 's true about the cockatrice and basilisk ; we were them . But animal brides  --  " " Oh , it would n't be so bad , miss . Just temporary , untilreal gals arrived . If she looks like a gal and feels likep201gal , I would n't blame her for being a bitch before . I mean , some gals are bitches  --  " " What 's a bitch ? " Bink asked . " A bitch ? You do n't know that ? " The sailor grimacedagain ; either he was in considerable pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . Like Jennifer . Hell , if Jennifer had human form  --  " " Enough , " Fanchon muttered . " Well , anyway , we 'll get homesteads and settle in . And our kid will be magic . I tell you , it 's that last that . ecruited me . I do n't believe in magic , understand  --  or I lid n't then  --  but I remember the fairy tales from when I as a little tyke , about the princess and the frog , and he mountain of glass , and the three wishes  --  well , look , was a metalworker for a crooked shop , know what I mean ? And I really wanted out of the rat race . " Bink shook his head silently . He understood only part of what the sailor was saying , but it did not make Mundania look very good . Stores that were built off balance , crooked ? Rats that raced ? Bink would want to get out of that culture , too . " A chance to have a decent life in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no question about his dedication to his vision . " Owning my own land , making good things grow , you know ? And my kids knowing magic , real magic  --  I guess I still do n't really believe that part , but even if it 's a lie , you know , it 's sure nice to think about . " " But to invade a foreign land , to take what does n't belong to you  --  " Fanchon said . She broke off , evidentlycertain that it was pointless to debate that sort of thing with a sailor . " He 'll betray you the moment he does n't need you . He 's an Evil Magician , exiled from Xanth . " " You mean he really can do magic ? " the man askedth happy disbelief . " I figured all this stuff was sleight of hand , you know , when I really thought about it . Iean , I believed some of the time , but  --  " " He sure as hell can do magic , " Bink put in , becom/ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you how he changed us  --  " " Never mind about that , " Fanchon said . " Well , he 's still a good leader , " the sailor insisted . He told us how he was kicked out twenty years ago because he tried to be King , and how he lost his magic , and married a gal from here and had a little boy  --  " " Trent has a family in Mundania ? " Bink asked , amazed . " We do n't call our country that , " the sailor said . " But yes  --  he had a family . Until this mystery bug went around  --  some kind of flu , I think , or maybe food poisoning  --  and they both got it and died . He said science had n't been able to save them , but magic could have , so he was going back to magicland . Xanth , you call it . But they 'd kill him if he just walked in alone , even if he got by the thing he called a Shield . So he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and heaved his shoulder up onto a pillow . So they had the sailor as comfortable as was feasible , his shoulder bound up in stray cloths . Bink would have liked to hear more of the man 's unique viewpoint . But 4 time had passed , and it was apparent that the other ship was gaining on them . They traced its progress by its sail , which moved laterally , back and forth , zigzagging against the wind  --  and with each pass it was closer . They had been wrong about the capabilities of ships in adverse wind . How much else were they wrong about ? Bink went into the cabin . He was feeling a bit seasick now , but he held it down . " Jennifer , " he said hesitantly , proffering some of the dog food they had found . The small spotted monster wagged her tail . Just like that , they were friends . Bink screwed up his courage and pattedher on the head , and she did not bite him . Then , while she ate , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the vial of greenish fluid he found therein , in a carefully padded box . Victory ! " Miss , " the sailor called as Bink emerged with the vial . " The Shield  --  "  |p203Fanchon  looked about nervously . " Is the current carrying us into that ? " " Yes , miss . I would n't interfere , but if you do n't turn this boat soon , we 'll all be dead . I know that Shield works ; I 've seen animals try to go through it and get fried . " " How can we tell where it is ? " she asked . " There 's a glimmer . See ? " He pointed with difficulty . Bink peered and saw it . They were drifting toward a curtain of faint luminescence , ghostly white . The Shield ! The ship progressed inexorably . " We ca n't stop it , " Franchon cried . " We 're going right through . " " Throw down the anchor ! " the sailor said . What else was there to do ? The Shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trent 's forces . Even bluffing them back by means of the vial of elixir would not suffice ; the ship remained a kind of prison . " We can use the lifeboat , " Fanchon said . " Give me the vial . " Bink gave it to her , then threw over the anchor . The ship slowly turned as the anchor took hold . The Shield loomed uncomfortably close  --  but so did the pursuing ship . Now it was clear why it was using the wind instead of the current ; it was under control , in no danger of drifting into the Shield . They lowered the lifeboat . A reflector lamp from the other ship bathed them in its light . Fanchon held the vial aloft . " I 'll drop it ! " she screamed at the enemy . " Hit me with an arrow  --  the elixir drowns with me . " " Give it back , " Trent 's voice called from the other ship . " I pledge to let you both go free . " " Ha ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ? I 'm afraid to set this thing down while we 're in range of their arrows . I want to be sure that no matter what happens to us , they do n't get this stuff . " " I 'll try , " Bink said . He settled himself , grabbed the oars , and heaved . One oar cracked into the side of the ship . The otherp204dug into the water . The boat skewed around . " Push off ! " Fanchon exclaimed . " You almost dumped me . " Bink tried to put the end of one oar against the ship , to push , but it did n't work because he could not maneuverthe oar free of its oarlock . But the current carried the boat along until it passed beyond the end of the ship . " We 're going into the Shield ! " Fanchon cried , wavingthe vial . " Row ! Row ! Turn the boat ! " Bink put his back into it . The problem with rowing was that he faced backward ; he could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding the S vial aloft , peering ahead . He got the feel of the oars and turned the boat , and now the shimmering curtain came into view on the side . It was rather pretty in its fashion , its ghostly glow parting the night  --  but he recoiled from its horror . " Go parallel to it , " Fanchon directed . " The closer we stay , the harder it 'll make it for the other ship . Maybe they 'll give up the pursuit . " Bink pulled on the oars . The boat moved ahead . But he was unused to this particular form of exertion , and not recovered from his fatigue of the swim , and he knew he could n't keep it up long . " You 're going into the Shield ! " Fanchon cried . Bink looked . The Shield loomed closer , yet he was not rowing toward it . " The current , " he said . " Carrying us sideways . " He had naively thought that once he started rowing , all other vectors ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " Quickly ! " He angled the boat  --  but the Shield did not retreat . The current was bearing them on as fast as he could row . To make it worse , the wind was now changing  --  and rising . He was holding even at the moment , but he was tiring rapidly . " I ca n't  --  keep this  --  up ! " he gasped , staring at the glow . " There 's an island , " Fanchon said . " Angle toward it . " Bink looked around . He saw a black something cut/ling the waves to the side . island ? it was no more than a treacherous rock . But if they could anchor to itHe put forth a desperate effort  --  but it was not enough . A storm was developing . They were going to miss the rock . The dread Shield loomed nearer . " I 'll help , " Fanchon cried . She set down the vial , crawled forward , and put her hands on the oars , oppositehis hands . She pushed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bink , fatigued , was distracted . In the erratic moonlight , blotted out intermittently by the thickening , fast-moving clouds above , her naked body lost some of its shapelessness and assumed the suggestion of more feminine contours .

Fanchon could be a good companion , if onlyThe boat smashed into the rock . It tilted  --  rock or craft or both . " Get hold ! Get hold ! " Fanchon cried as water surged over the side . Bink reached out and tried to hang on to the stone . It was both abrasive and slippery . A wave broke over him , filling his mouth with its salty spume . Now it was black ; the clouds had completed their engulfment of the moon . " The elixir ! " Fanchon cried . " I left it in the  --  " She dived for the flooded stern of the boat .

He suffered a foolish vision : if a giant drowning in the ocean grabbed on to the land of Xanth for support , his fingers would catch in the chasm , the Cap . Maybe that was the purpose of the Gap . Did the tiny inhabitants of this isolated rock resent the crevice that Bink 's giant fingers had found ? Did they have forgetspells to remove it from their awareness ? There was a distant flash of lightning . Bink saw the somber mass of ragged stone : no miniature people on it . But there was a glint , as of light reflecting from ap206knob in the water . He stared at it , but the lightning was long since gone , and he was squinting at the mere memory , trying to make out the surrounding shape . For it had been a highlight from something larger . Lightning flashed again , closer . Bink saw briefly but clearly . It was a toothy reptilian creature . The highlight had been from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cried , terrified . Fanchon labored at an oar , finally extricating it from its lock . She aimed it at the monster and shoved . Thank ! The end of the oar struck the armored green snout . The creature backed off . " We 've got to get away from here , " Bink cried . But as he spoke , another wave broke over them . The boat was lifted and wrenched away from his feet . He put one arm about Fanchon 's skinny waist and hung on . It seemed the fingers of his other hand would break  --  but they remained wedged in the crevice , and he held his position . In the next trough the lightning showed small saillike I projections moving in the water . What were they ? Then another monster broke water right beside him ; he saw it in the phosphorescence that the complete darkness had attuned his eyes to . It seemed to have a .1 single broad eye across its face , and a round , truncated snout . Huge wattles were at the sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the details were really from his imagination . He could only stare at the thing as the lightning permitted . And the lightning confirmed his imagination . It was a hideous monster ! Bink struggled with his terror to form some plan of defense . One hand clung to the rock ; the other held Fanchon . He could not act . But maybe Fanchon could . " Your oar  --  " he gasped . The monster acted first . It put its hands to its face  --  and lifted the face away . Underneath , was the face of Evil Magician Trent . " You fools have caused enoughp207rouble ! Give me the elixir , and I 'll have the ship throw ' Is a line . " Bink hesitated . He was bone-weary and cold , and knew he could not hold out much longer against storm and current . It was death to stay here . " There 's a crocodile sniffing around , " Trent continued . " And several sharks . Those are just as deadly as the mythical monsters you are familiar with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rapidly as it diffuses into the water , so it 's not much help . On top of that , sometimes whirlpools develop around these rocks , especially during storms . We need help now= and I alone can summon it . Give me that vial ! " " Never ! " Fanchon cried . She dived into the black waves . Trent snapped the mask back over his face and dived after her . As he moved , Bink saw that the Magician was naked except for his long sword strapped to a harness . Bink dived after him , not even thinking of what he was doing . They met in a tangle underwater . In the dark and bubbly swirl , there was nothing but mutual mischief . Rink tried to swim to the surface , uncertain as to what foolishness had prompted him to dive here but sure that he could only drown himself . But someone had a death grip on him . He had to get up , to get his head in air so he could breathe . The water had hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the whirlpool  --  an inanimate funnel monster . It sucked them down , spinning , into the depth of its maw . For the second time Bink felt himself drowning  --  and this time he knew no Sorceress would rescue him.  |p208Bink  woke with his face in sand . Around him lay the inert tentacles of a green monster . He groaned and sat up . " Bink ! " Fanchon cried gladly , coming across the beach to him . " I thought it was night , " he said . " You 've been unconscious . This cave has magic phosphorescence , or maybe it 's Mundane phosphorescence , since there was some on the rock , too . But it 's much brighter here . Trent pumped the water out of you , but I was afraid  --  " " What 's this ? " Bink asked , staring at a green tentacle . " A kraken seaweed , " Trent said . " It pulled us out of the drink , intending to consume us  --  but the vial of elixir broke and killed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vial had broken earlier , it would have stopped the kraken from catching us , and we all would have drowned ; later , and we would already have been eaten . As fortuitous a coincidence of timing as I have ever ex-perienced . " " A kraken weed ! " Bink exclaimed . " But that 's magic ! " " We 're back in Xanth , " Fanchon said . " But  --  " " I conjecture that the whirlpool drew us down below the effective level of the Shield , " Trent said . " We passed under it . Perhaps the presence of the elixir helped . A freak accident  --  and I 'm certainly not going to try to reverse that route now . I lost my breathingp209apparatus on the way in ; lucky I got a good dose of oxygen first ! We 're in Xanth to stay . " " I guess so , " Bink said dazedly . He had gradually becomeaccustomed to the notion of spending the rest of his life in Mundania ; it was hard to abandon that drear expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Once the elixir was gone  --  " " It was the decent thing to do , " the Magician said . " I realize you will not appreciate such a notion from my lips , but I can offer no better rationale at the moment . I never had any personal animus against you ; in fact , I rather admired your fortitude and personal ethical code . You can go your way now  --  and I 'll go mine . " Bink pondered . He was faced with a new , unfamiliar reality . Back in Xanth , no longer at war with the Evil Magician . The more he reviewed the details , the less sense any of it made . Sucked down by a whirlpoolthrough monster-infested waters , through the invisiblebut deadly Shield , to be rescued by a man-eating plant , which was coincidentally nullified at precisely the momentrequired to let them drop safely on this beach ? " No , " he said . " I do n't believe it . Things just do n't happenthis way . " " It does seem as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the Evil Magician should have been included . . . " Trent smiled . Naked , he was fully as impressive as before . Despite his age , he was a fit and powerful man . " It does seem ironic that the evil should be saved alongwith the good . Perhaps human definitions are not clwayshonored by nature . But I , like you , am a realist . Ido n't pretend to understand how we got here  --  but I donot question that we are here . Getting to land may be more problematical , however . We are hardly out ofdanger yet . " Bink looked around the cave . Already the air seemed close , though he hoped that was his imagination . There seemed to be no exit except the water through whichp210they had come . In one nook was a pile of clean bones -- the refuse of the kraken . It began to seem less coincidental . What better place for an ocean monster to operate than at the exit to awhirlpool ? The sea itself collected the prey , and most of it was killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weed had only to sieve the fresh bodies out of the water . And this highly private cave was ideal for leisurely con- sumption of the largest living animals . They could be deposited here on the beach , and even given food , sothat they would remain more or less healthy until thekraken 's hunger was sufficient . A pleasant little larder to keep the food fresh and tasty . Any that tried to escapeby swimming past the tentacles  --  ugh ! So the kraken could have dropped the human trio here , then been hit by the elixir ; instead of split-second timing , itbecame several-minute timing . Still a coincidence , but much less extreme one . Fanchon was squatting by the water , flicking dry leaves into it . The leaves had to be from past seasons of the kraken weed ; why it needed them here , with no sun- light , Bink did n't understand . Maybe it had been a reg- ular plant before it turned magic  --  or its ancestors hadbeen regular  --  and it still had not entirely adapted . Ormaybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to be understood about nature . At any rate , Fanchon was floating the leaves on the water , and why she wasted her time that way was similarly opaque . She saw him looking . " I 'm tracing surface currents , " she said . " See  --  the water is moving that way . Therehas to be an exit under that wall . " Bink was impressed again with her intelligence . Everytime he caught her doing something stupid , it turned out to be the opposite . She was an ordinary , if ugly , girl , but she had a mind that functioned efficiently . She hadplotted their escape from the pit , and their subsequent strategy , and it had nullified Trent 's program of conquest . Now she was at it again . Too bad her appearane , fell down.  | " Of course , " Trent agreed . " The kraken ca n't live in stagnant water ; it needs a constant flow . That brings in its food supply and carries away its wastes . We have an exit  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pass through the Shield again . " Bink did n't like it . " Suppose we dive into that current and it carries us a mile underwater before it comes out ? We 'd drown . " " My friend , " Trent said , " I have been pondering that very dilemma . We can not be rescued by my sailors , because we are obviously beyond the Shield . I do not like to gamble on either the current or what we may discover within it . Yet it seems we must eventually do so , for we can not remain here indefinitely . " Something twitched . Bink looked  --  and saw one green tentacle writhing . " The kraken 's reviving ! " he exclaimed . " It is n't dead ! " " Uh-oh , " Trent said . " The elixir has thinned out in the current and dissipated . The magic is returning . I had thought that concentration would be fatal to a magic creature , but apparently not . " Fanchon watched the tentacles . Now others were quivering . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Soon . " " But we do n't dare plunge into the water without knowing where it goes , " Bink objected . " We must be well below the surface . I 'd rather stay here and fight than drown . " " I propose we declare a truce between us until we get free , " Trent said . " The elixir is gone , and we can not go back the way we came from Mundania . We shall probably have to cooperate to get out of here  --  and in the present situation , we really have no quarrel . " Fanchon did n't trust him . " So we help you get out  --  so then the truce ends and you change us into gnats . Since we 're inside Xanth , we 'll never be able to change back again . " Trent snapped his fingers . " Stupid of me to forget . Thank you for reminding me . I can use my magic nowp212to get us out . " He looked at the quivering green tenta- Iles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the elixir isgone , for it voids my magic , too . That means the krakenwill be fully recovered . I ca n't transform it , because its main body is too far away . " The tentacles lifted . " Bink , dive for it ! " Fanchon cried . " We do n't want to be caught between the kraken and the Evil Magician . " She plunged into the water . The issue had been forced . She was right : the kraken would eat them or the Magician would transform them . Right now , while the lingering elixir blunted boththreats , was the time to escape . Still , he would have hes- itated  --  if Fanchon had not already taken action . If she drowned , there would be no one on his side . Bink charged across the sand , tripped over a tentacle , and sprawled . Reacting automatically , the tentaclewrapped itself around his leg . The leaves glued them- selves to his flesh with little sucking noises . Trent drewhis sword and strode toward him . Bink grabbed a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was ineffective . Then Trent 's swordslashed down  --  and severed the tentacle . " You are in no danger from me , Bink , " the Magician said . " Swim , ifyou wish . " Bink scrambled up and dived into the water , taking adeep breath . He saw Fanchon 's feet kicking ahead ofhim as she swam down , and saw the dark tube of thenether exit . It terrified him , and he balked . His head popped through the surface . There was Trent , standing on the beach , parrying the converging tentacles with his sword . Fighting off the coils of the monster the man was the very picture of heroism . Yet the moment the combat was over , Trent would be amore dangerous monster than the kraken . Bink decided . He took a new breath and dived again . This time he stroked right into the somber eye , and feltthe current take him . Now there was no turning back . The tunnel opened out almost immediately  --  into anotherglowing cavern . Bink had gained on Fanchon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been more cautious about navigating the exitHeads turned their way . Human heads , on human torsos  --  very nice feminine ones . Their faces were elfin their tresses flowing in magical iridescence over slende bare shoulders and perfectly erect breasts . But the lowe quarters merged into fish 's tails . These were mermaids " What are you doing in our cave ? " one of the maid cried indignantly . " Just passing through , " Bink said . Naturally , mer maids spoke the common language of Xanth . Hfwould not have thought anything of it , had Trent noremarked on how Xanth language merged with al Mundane languages . Magic operated in so many ways " Tell us the shortest way to the surface . " " That way , " one said , pointing left . " That way , " an . other said , pointing right . " No , that way ! " a third cried pointing straight up . There was a burst of girlish laugh . ter . Several mermaids plunged into the water , tails flashing , and swam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up close , the creatures were even prettier that from afar . Each one had a perfect complexion , resulting from the natural action of the water , and their breast ; floated somewhat , making them seem fuller . Maybe hE had been exposed to Fanchon too long ; the sight of al this loveliness gave him strange sensations of excitemen and nostalgia . If he could grab them all at once  --  bu no , they were mermaids , not his type at all . They paid no attention to Fanchon . " He 's a man ! ' one cried , meaning Bink was human , not merman " Look at his split legs . No tail at all . " Suddenly they were diving under to view his legs Bink , naked , found this distinctly awkward . They begat to put their hands on him , kneading the unfamiliar mus culature of his legs , a great curiosity to them . Yet wh : were n't they looking at Fanchon 's legs too ? Then seemed to be more mischief than curiosity here . Trent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he commented . " We 'll get nothing from them . " So it seemed . It also seemed that the Magician could not be avoided . " I think we 'd better make the truce , " Bink said to Fanchon . " We have to extend some trust sometime . " She looked at the mermaids , then at Trent . " Very well , " she said ungraciously . " For what it 's worth  --  which is n't much . " " A sensible decision , " Trent said . " Our long-range objectives may differ , but our short-range one matches : survival . See , here come the tritons . " As he spoke , a group of mermen appeared , swimming in from another passage . This seemed to be a labyrinthof caves and water-filled apertures . " Ho ! " a triton cried , brandishing his trident . " Skew-er ! " The mermaids screamed playfully and dived out of sight . Bink avoided Fanchon 's gaze ; the ladies had been having entirely too much fun with him , and obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight , " Trent said . " The elixir is gone . With your acquiescence , under our truce , I will change you both into fish , or perhaps reptiles , so that you canescape . However- " " How will we change back ? " Fanchon demanded . " That is the key . I can not change myself . Therefore you will have to rescue me  --  or remain transformed . So we shall survive together , or suffer apart . Fair enough ? " She looked at the tritons , who were swimming determinedlytoward the three , surrounding them , tridents raised . They did not look at all playful . This was obviouslya gang of bullies , showing off for the applauding spectators  --  the mermaids , who had now reappeared on shore  --  taking time to put on a flashy show . " Why not change them into fish ? " " That would abate the immediate threat , could I get them all in time , " Trent agreed . " But it still would not free us from the cave . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point , regardless . And wep215are intruders in their cave ; there is a certain proprietaryethic  --  " " All right ! " she cried , as a triton heaved his three- pointed fork . " Do it your way . " Suddenly she was a monster  --  one of the worst Binkhad seen . She had a huge greenish sheath around her torso , from which arms , legs , head , and tail projected . Her feet were webbed , and her head was like that of aserpent . The triton 's fork struck the Fanchon-monster 's shell  --  and bounced off . Suddenly Bink saw the sense ofthis transformation . This monster was invulnerable . " Sea turtle , " Trent murmured . " Mundane . Harmless , normally  --  but the merfolk do n't know that . I 've made a study of nonmagical creatures , and have developedmuch respect for them . Oops ! " Another trident was flying . Then Bink was also a sea turtle . Suddenly he wascompletely comfortable in the water , and he had no fear of the pronged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would simply pull in his head . It would not retract all the way , but the armor of the shell around it would intercept al- most anything . Something tugged at his carapace . Bink started to dive , trying to dislodge it  --  then realized , in his reptilian brain , that this was something that had to be tolerated . Not a friend , but an ally  --  for now . So he dived , but allowed the dragging weight to persist . Bink stroked slowly but powerfully for the underwa- ter passage . The other turtle had already entered it . Bink did n't worry about air ; he knew he could hold hisbreath for as long as it took . It did not take long . This passage slanted up to thesurface ; Bink could see the moon as he broke through . The storm had abated . Abruptly he was human again  --  and swimming was harder . " Why did you change me back ? " he asked . " Wewere n't to shore yet . " " When you are a turtle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instincts of a turtle , " Trent explained . " Otherwiseyou would not be able to survive as a turtle . Too long , and you might forget you ever were a man . If you headed out to sea , I might not be able to catch you , and so would never be able to change you back . " " Justin Tree retained his human mind , " Bink pointed out . " Justin Tree ? " " One of the men you changed into trees , in the North Village . His talent was throwing his voice . " " Oh , I remember now . He was a special case . I made him into a sapient tree  --  really a man in tree form , not a true tree . I can do that when I put my mind to it . For ait tree it can work . But a turtle needs turtle reflexes to deal with the ocean . " Bink did n't follow all that , but he did n't care to debateit . Obviously cases differed . Then Fanchon reappearedin human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said grudgingly . " I did n't really think you would . " " Reality must intrude sometime , " Trent said . " What do you mean by that ? " she demanded . " I said , we are not out of danger yet . I believe that is a sea serpent on its way . " Bink saw the huge head , and there was no question : the monster had seen them . It was big ; the head was a yard across . " Maybe the rocks  --  " Bink cried , orienting on the outcropping that marked the exit from the tritons ' cave . " That thing 's a huge , long snake , " Fanchon said . " It could reach right down into the cave , or coil right around the rocks . We ca n't escape it in this form . " " I could change you into poisonous jellyfish that theserpent would not eat , " Trent said . " But you might get lost in the shuffle . It also may not be wise to be transformedmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to verify this during my exile , for obvious reasons , but I am concerned that your systems may suffer a shockeach time . "  | " Besides which , the monster could still eat you , ' Fanchon said . " You have a very quick mind , " Trent agreed equa bly . " Therefore , I shall have to do something I dislike  --  transformthe monster . " " You do n't want to transform the sea serpent ? " Binh asked , surprised . The thing was now quite close , it ; small red eyes fixed on the prey ; saliva dripped from it giant teeth . " It is merely an innocent creature going about it business , " Trent said . " We should not enter its waters ii we do not wish to participate in its mode of existence , There is a balance of nature , whether magical or mundane , that we should hesitate to interfere with . " " You have a weird sense of humor , " Fanchon said sourly . " But I never claimed to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect its life style . transform it into a little fish until we get to shore , then transform it back . " " And hurry ! " Bink cried . The thing was now loomingover them , orienting on its specific targets . " That would not work , " Trent said . " The fish would swim away and be lost . I must be able to identify the particular creature I mean to transform , and it must be within six feet of me . However your suggestion has merit . " " Six feet , " Bink said . " We 'll be inside it before we get that close . " He was not trying to be funny ; the monster 's mouth was much longer than it was wide , sc that as it opened to its full aperture the upper front teeth were a good twelve feet from the lower teeth . " Nevertheless , I must operate within my limits , " Trent said , unperturbed . " The critical region is the head , the seat of identity . When I transform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when only the tail was within range , I would botch the job . So when it tries to take me in its mouth , it comes into my power . " " What if it goes for one of us first ? " Fanchon de/manded . " Suppose we 're more than six feet from you ? " " I suggest you arrange to be within that radius , " Trent said dryly . Hastily Bink and Fanchon splashed closer to the Evil Magician . Bink had the distinct impression that even if Trent had had no magic , they would have been in his power . He was too self-assured , too competent in histactics ; he knew how to manage people . The sea monster 's body convulsed . Its head struck down , teeth leading . Spittle sprayed out from it in obscenelittle clouds . Fanchon screamed hysterically . Bink felt an instant and pervading terror . That sensation wasbecoming all too familiar ; he simply was no hero . But as the awful jaws closed on them , the sea serpentvanished . In its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly in one hand and setit on his own hair , where it perched quiveringly . " A love bug , " Trent explained . " They are not good fliers , and they hate water . This one will stay close until we emerge from the sea . " Now the three swam for shore . It took them some time , for the sea remained choppy and they were tired , but no other creatures bothered them . Apparently no lesser predators intruded on the fishing territory of the sea monster . An understandable attitude  --  but probably within hours a host of aggressive forms would converge if the sea monster did not return . As Trent had remarked , there was always a balance of nature . The phosphorescence became stronger in the shallows . Some of it was from glowing fish , flashing in colorsto communicate with their respective kinds ; most of it was from the water itself . Washes of pale green , yellow , orange  --  magic , of course , but for what purpose ? There was so much Bink saw , wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom he saw shells , some lighted around the fringes , some glowing in patterns . A few vanished as he passed over them ; whether they had become truly invisible or merely doused their lights he could not tell . Regardless , they were magic , and thatp219was familiar . Belatedly he realized that he was glad t ( be back among the familiar threats of Xanth ! Dawn was coming as they reached the beach . Thi sun pushed up behind the clouds over the jungle am finally burst through to bounce its shafts off the water It was a thing of marvelous beauty . Bink clung to tha concept , because his body was numb with fatigue , hi ! brain locked onto the torture of moving limbs , over anc over , on and on . At last he crawled upon the beach . Fanchon crawlec beside him . " Do n't stop yet , " she said . " We must seer cover , lest other monsters come , from the beach or jungle . . But Trent stood knee-deep in the surf , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. tired as they were . " Return , friend , " he said , flicking something into the sea . The sea monster reappeared , its serpentine convolutions much more impressive in the shallow water . Trent had to lift his feet and splash back out of the way , lest he be crushed by a hugely swinging coil . But the monster was not looking for trouble now . I1 was extremely disgruntled . It , gave a single honk of rage or of anguish or of mere amazement and thrashed its way toward deeper pastures . Trent walked up the beach . " It is not fun to be a defenseless love bug when you are accustomed to being the king of the sea , " he said . " I hope the creature does not suffer a nervous breakdown . " He was not smiling . There was something funny , Bink thought , about a man who liked monsters that well . But of course Trent was the Evil Magician of the contemporary scene . The man was strangely handsome , mannerly , and erudite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his affinities were to the monsters more than to the men . It would be disastrous ever to forgel that . Odd that Humfrey , the Good Magician , was an ugly little gnome in a forbidding castle , selfishly using hisp220magic to enrich himself , while Trent was the epitome of hero material . The Sorceress Iris had seemed lovely and sexy , but was in fact nondescript ; Humfrey 's good qualities were manifest in his actions , once a person really got to know him . But Trent , so far , had seemed good in both appearance and deed , at least on the purely personal level . If Bink had met him for the first time in the kraken 's cave and had n't known the man 's evil nature , he would never have guessed it . Now Trent strode across the beach , seeming hardly tired despite the grueling swim . The nascent sunlight touched his hair , turning it bright yellow . He looked in that instant like a god , all that was perfect in man . Again Bink suffered fatigued confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what he knew to be the man 's actual nature , and again findingit so challenging as to be virtually impossible . Some things just had to be taken on faith . " I 've got to rest , to sleep , " Bink muttered . " I ca n't tell evil from good right now . " Fanchon looked toward Trent . " I know what you mean , " she said , shaking her head so that her ratty hair shifted its wet tangles . " Evil has an insidious way about it , and there is some evil in all of us that seeks to dominate . We have to fight it , no matter how tempting it becomes . " Trent arrived . " We seem to have made it , " he said cheerfully . " It certainly is good to be back in Xanth , by whatever freak of fortune . Ironic that you , who sought so ardently to prevent my access , instead facilitatedit ! " " Ironic , " Fanchon agreed dully . " I believe this is the coast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Gap . I had not realized we had drifted so far south , but the contour of the land seems definitive . That means we are not yet out of trouble . " " Rink 's an exile , you 're banished , and I 'm ugly , " Fanchon muttered . " We 'll never be out of trouble . "  | " Nevertheless , I believe it would be expedient to extendour truce until we are free of the wilderness , " the Magician said . Did Trent know something Bink did n't ? Bink had no magic , so he would be prey to all the sinister spells of the deep jungle . Fanchon had no apparent magic  --  strange , she claimed her exile had been voluntary , not forced , yet if she really had no magic she should have been banished too ; anyway , she would have a similar problem . But Trent  --  with his skills with sword and spell , he should have no reason to fear this region . Fanchon had similar doubts . " As long as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being transformed into toads . I ca n't see that the wilderness is worse . " Trent spread his hands . " I realize you do not trust me , and perhaps you have reason . I believe your securityand mine would be enhanced if we cooperated a little longer , but I shall not force my company on you . " He walked south along the beach . " He knows something , " Bink said . " He must be leavingus to die . So he can be rid of us without breaking his word . " " Why should he care about his word ? " Fanchon asked . " That would imply he is a man of honor . " Bink had no answer . He crawled to the shade and concealment of the nearest tree and collapsed in the downy sward . He had been unconscious during part of the last night , but that was not the same as sleep ; he needed genuine rest . When he woke it was high noon  --  and he was fixed in place . There was no pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head or hands . They were fastened to the ground by myriad threads , as if the very lawn hadOh , no ! In the numbness of fatigue , he had been so careless as to lie in a bed of carnivorous grass ! The root blades had grown up into his body , infiltrating it so slowly and subtly that it had not disturbed his sleep  --  and now he was caught . Once he had happened on a patch of the stuff near the North Village with an animalp222skeleton on it . The grass had consumed all the flesh . He had wondered how any creature could have been so stupidas to be trapped by such a thing . Now he knew . He was still breathing , therefore he could still yell . He did so with a certain gusto . " Help ! " There was no response . " Fanchon ! " he cried . " I 'm tied down . The grass is eating me up . " Actually that was an exaggeration ; he was not hurt , merely bound to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon they would start to feed , drawing the life proteins from his flesh . Still nothing . He realized she would not or could not help him . Probably something had put a sleep spell on her . It was obvious , in retrospect , that there were plenty of deadly threats right here at the edge of the beach ; she must have fallen into another . She might be dead already . " Help ! Anybody ! " he screamed desperately . That was another mistake . All around him , in the forest and along the beach , things were stirring . He had advertised his helplessness , and now they were coming to take advantage of it . Had he struggled with the grass in silence , he might have managed in time to work his way free ; he had awakened before it was ready for the kilt luckily . Maybe he had tried to turn over in his sleep , and his body had objected to the resistance strongly enough to throw off the stasis spell the grass was applying . If he struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly comfortable  --  just a slow sinking into eternal sleep . Now by his noise he had summonedmuch less comfortable menaces . He could not see them , but he could hear them . From the nearby tree came a rustle , as of meat eating squirrels . From the beach came a scrape , as of hungry acid crabs . From the sea came a horrible kind of splashing , as of a small sea monster who had sneaked into the territory of the big sea monster Trent had transformed . Now this little one struggled to get out of the water and cross to the prey before it was gone . But the mostp223dreadful sound of all was the pound-pound-pound of the footfalls of something deep in the forest , large and far away but moving extremely rapidly . A shadow fell on him . " Hi ! " a shrill voice cried . Ii was a harpy , cousin to the one he had met on the way back to the North Village . She was every bit as ugly , smelly , and obnoxious  --  and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching down , twitching . The other harpy had seen him healthy , so had stayed well out of reach  --  though she might have descendedhad he actually drunk from the Spring of Love . Ugh ! This one saw him helpless . She had a human face and human breasts , so was hi that sense female , like the mermaids . But in lieu of arms she had great greasy wings , and her body was that of a gross bird . And she was a dirty bird ; not only were het face and breasts grotesquely shaped , grime was caked on them . It was a wonder she could fly at all . Bink had not had the opportunity  --  or desire  --  to appreciate the qualities of the prior harpy at close range ; now he had a really excellent nether view . Double ugh ! The mermaidshad represented much that was lovely in the femaleform ; this harpy was the ugly aspect . She made Fanchonlook halfway decent in comparison ; at leasi Fanchon was clean . She dropped on him , claws clutching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrails they were about to rip out of his exposed gut . Some of the nails were broken and jagged . He caught the odor of her , a stink like none he remembered . " Oooh , you big handsomehunk of meat ! " she screeched . " You look good enough to eat . I can hardly choose what to take first . ' And she burst into maniacal laughter . Bink , absolutely horrified , put forth the supreme effortof his life and wrenched one arm free of the grass Little roots trailed from it , and the separation was painful . He was lying partly on his side , one cheek anchored , so he had a very limited field of vision , but his ears continued to bring him the dreadful news of thep224threats about him . He struck at the harpy , scaring her off for the moment . She was of course a coward ; her character matched her appearance . Her wings fluttered heavily . A soiled feather drifted down . " Oooh , you naughty boy ! " she screeched . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a screech ; her voice was so harsh as to be almost incomprehensible . " I 'll goozle your gizzard for that . " And she emitted her horrible cackle again . But now a shadow fell on Bink , from something he could not see  --  but the outline was awful . He heard heavy breathing , as of some great animal , and smelled its carrion-coated breath , which for the moment overrodethe stench of the harpy . It was the thing from the sea , its feet dragging as it hunched forward . It sniffed him  --  and the other creatures stopped moving in , afraid to stand up to this predator . All except the harpy . She was ready to heap vilificationon anything , from the safety of the air . " Get away , argus ! " she screeched . " He 's mine , all mine , especially his gizzard . " And she dropped down again , forgetting Bink 's free arm . For once Bink did n't mind . He could fight off the dirty bird , but this other thing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted . The unseen thing snorted and leaped , passing rightover B ink 's four stout Nowshort legs it : body and tail of a large fish , in flippers , tusked head of a boar , no neck . Three eyes were set along its torso , the middle one set lower than the others . Bink had never seen a monster quite like this before  --  a land-walking fish . The harpy flew up out of the way just in time , narrowlymissing being gored by the thing 's semicircular horns . Another stinking feather fell . She screeched some really disgusting insults in her ire , and let fly with a gooey dropping , but the monster ignored her and turned to concentrate on Bink . It opened its mouth , and Bink made a fist to punch it in the snout for what littlep225good that might do  --  when abruptly it paused , gazin balefully over Bink 's shoulder . " Now you 'll get it , argus , " the harpy screeched glee fully . " Even a fishy lout like you ca n't ignore catoble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or catoblepas but another quake of deep misgiving went through hin He felt the muzzle of the hidden monster nudge him . was oddly soft  --  but such was its power that it rippe him half out of the grass . Then the pig-snouted argus charged , furious that it meal should be taken away . Bink dropped flat agair letting the slimy flippers pass over him  --  and their im pact dislodged more of his body . He was getting freeThe two brutes collided . " Sic ' em , monsters ! " th harpy screeched , hovering overhead . In her excitemer over this mischief she let fall another large squish dropping , which just missed Bink 's head . If only he hai a rock to throw at her ! He sat up . One leg remained anchored  --  but now h had anchorage to rip out of the clutch of the demo weed . It did n't even hurt this time . He looked at th battling monsters  --  and saw the snakelike hair of the ca toblepas twined around the head of the argus , grippin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeballs  --  anything avail able . The body of the catoblepas was covered with rep tilian scales , from its gorgon head to its cloven hooves invulnerable to the attack of the argus . In overall shap it was like any quadruped , not all that remarkable ; bu that deadly writhing prehensile head hair  --  what a hor- ror ! Had he really wanted to return to magic Xanth ? He had so conveniently forgotten its uglier aspect . Magi had as much evil as good .. Maybe Mundania would reallyhave been better . " Fools ! " the harpy cried , seeing Bink loose . " He ' getting away . " But the monsters were now enmeshed their own struggle , and paid her no attention . No doubtp226the winner would feast on the loser , and Bink would be superfluous . She darted down at Bink , forgetting all caution . But he was on his feet now , and able to fight . He reached up and caught her by one wing , trying to get his handsti around her scrawny throat . He would gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Xanth . But she squawked and fluttered so violently that all he got was a handful of gummy feathers . Bink took advantage of his luck and ran away from the fray . The harpy fluttered after him for a moment , screeching such hideously foul insults that his ears burned , but soon gave up . She had no chance of overcominghim by herself . Harpies were basically carrion feeders and thieves , not hunters . It was their fashion to snatch food from the mouths of others . There was now no sign of the other creatures that had rustled and scraped toward him ; they too were predators only of the helpless . Where was Fanchon ? Why had n't she come to help him ? She surely must have heard his cries for help  --  if she still lived . There was no way she could have been unaware of the recent fracas . So this must meanNo ! She had to be somewhere . Maybe down by the sea , catching fish , out of hearing . She had been invaluableduring the past two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without her he could never have escaped the power of the Evil Magician . For intelligence and personality she had it all over the other girls he had met . Too bad she wasn'tHe saw her , resting against a tree . " Fanchon ! " he cried gladly . " Hello , Bink , " she said . Now his worry and speculation translated into ire . " Did n't you see me being attacked by those monsters ? Did n't you hear ? " " I saw , I heard , " she said quietly . Bink was baffled and resentful . " Why did n't you helpp227me ? You could at least have grabbed a stick or thrown rocks . I was almost eaten alive ! " " I 'm sorry , " she said . He took another step toward her . " You 're sorry ! You just rested here doing nothing and  --  " He cut off , losing the words to continue . " Maybe if you moved me from the tree , " she said . " I 'll dump you in the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned over to grab her roughly by the arm , andfelt a sudden wash of weakness . Now he understood . The tree had put a lethargy spell on her , and was starting in on him . As with the carnivo- rous grass , it took time to take full effect ; she must havesettled here to sleep , as careless in her fatigue as he hadbeen in his , and was now far gone . There was no actual discomfort to alert potential prey , just a slow , insidious draining of vitality , of strength and will , until it all was gone . Very similar to the grass , actually , only this was less tangible . He fought it off . He squatted beside her , sliding his arms under her back and legs . He really was n't too weak , yet ; if he acted fastHe started to lift her  --  and discovered that his squat- ling posture had given him a false sense of well-being He could not raise her up ; in fact , he was n't sure hecould stand alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! That would be the end . He dared not yield to it . " Sorry I yelled at you , " he said . " I did n't realize what you were in . " " That 's all right , Bink . Take it easy . " She closed her eyes . He let go of her and backed away on his hands and knees . " Good-bye , " she said listlessly , reopening one eye . She was almost done for . He took hold of her feet and pulled . Another surge of weakness came , making the job seem impossible . It wasas much emotional as physical . There was no way hecould haul her weight . He tried anyway , his stubbon/ness prevailing over even this magic . But he failed . She was too heavy for him here . He backed farther away  --  and as he left the environs of the tree his energy and will returned . But now she was beyond his reach . He stood up and took another step toward her  --  and lost his strength again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never make it this way . Again he hauled himself back , sweating with the effortof concentration . Were he less stubborn , he would not have gotten this far . " I ca n't get you out , and I 'm only wasting time , " he said apologetically . " Maybe I can loop you with a rope . " But there was no rope . He walked along the trees of the edge of the jungle and spied a dangling vine . That would do nicely if he could get it loose . He grabbed it in one hand  --  and screamed . The thingwrithed in his grasp and looped about his wrist , imprisoningit . More vines dropped from the tree , swingingtoward him . This was a land kraken , a variant of the tangle tree ! He was still being fatally careless , walking directly into traps that should never have fooled him . Bink dropped , yanking on the vine with his full weight . It stretched to accommodate him , twining more tightly about his arm . But now he spied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior prey ; he swept it up with his free hand and poked at the vine with it , puncturing it . Thick orange sap welled out . The whole tree shivered . There was a high keening of pain . Reluctantly the vine loosened , and he drew his arm free . Another close call . He ran on down the beach , searching for whatever would help him . Maybe a sharp-edged stone , to cut off a vine  --  no , the other vines would get him . Give up that idea . Maybe a long pole ? No , similar problem . Thisit peaceful-seeming beach was a morass of danger , really coming alive ; anything and everything was suspect . Then he saw a human body : Trent , sitting cross/legged on the sand , looking at something . It seemed to be a colorful gourd ; maybe he was eating it . Bink paused . Trent could help him ; the Magician could change the fatigue tree into a salamander and kill it , or at least render it harmless . But Trent himself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he choose ? Well , he would try to negotiate . The known evil ofthe tree might not be as bad as the uncertain evil of the Magician , but it was more immediate . " Trent , " he said hesitantly . The man paid him no attention . He continued to stare at his gourd . He did not actually seem to be eating it . What , then , was its fascination ? Bink hesitated to provoke the man , but he did not know how long he could afford to wait . Fanchon wasit slowly dying ; at what point would she be too far gone to be revived , even if rescued from the tree ? Some risk had to be taken . " Magician Trent , " he said , more firmly . " I think we should extend the truce . Fanchon is caught , and  --  " He stopped , for the man was still ignoring him . Bink 's fear of the Magician began to change , much as had his attitude toward Fanchon when he thought she was malingering . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent one way or another , whatever the cost . " Lis- ten , she 's in trouble ! " he snapped . " Are you going to help or are n't you ? " Still Trent paid no attention . Bink , still weary from the rigors of the night and un- nerved by his recent experiences , suffered a lapse of sanity . " Damn it , answer me ! " he cried , knocking the gourd from the Magician 's hands . The thing flew six feet , landing in the sand and rolling . Trent looked up . There was no sign of anger in his countenance , just mild surprise . " Hello , Bink , " he said " What is your concern ? " " My concern ! " Bink cried . " I told you three times . " Trent looked at him , puzzled . " I did not hear you . "  |p230The  Magician paused thoughtfully . " In fact , I did not see you arrive . I must have been sleeping , though I had not intended to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bink said hotly . " Now I remember . I saw it lying on the beach , and it looked intriguing  --  " He broke off , glancing at his shadow . " By the sun , that was an hour ago ! Where did the time go ? " Bink realized that something was amiss . He went to pick up the gourd . " Hold ! " Trent barked . " That 's hypnotic ! " Bink stopped in place . " What ? " " Hypnotic . That 's a Mundane term , meaning it puts you into a trance , a waking sleep . It usually takes some time to do  --  but of course a magic-spell hypnosis could be instant . Do n't look too closely at the gourd . Its pretty colors must be intended to attract the eye ; then it has  --  yes , I remember now  --  a peephole . A single glance into its fascinating innards becomes eternal . Very nice de-vice . " " But what 's the point ? " Bink asked , averting his gaze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  " " But the gourd vine might , " Trent pointed out . " Or it may be that a quiescent living body might be excellent food for its seeds to grow on . There are wasps in Mundaniathat sting other creatures , stunning them , and lay their eggs in the bodies . We can be sure it makes some sort of sense . " Still Bink was bemused . " How is it that you , a Magician . ? " " Magicians are human too , Bink . We eat , sleep , love , hate , and err . I am as vulnerable to magic as you are ; I merely have a more potent weapon with which to protectmyself . If I wanted to be entirely secure , I would lock myself within a stone castle , like my friend Humfrey . My chances of survival in this wilderness would be greatly enhanced by the presence of one or two alert , loyal companions . This is why I proposed the extensionp231of our truce  --  and I still feel it is a good idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you do n't . " He looked at Bink . " Why did you help me , just now ? " " I  --  " Bink was ashamed to admit the accidental na- ture of that assistance . " I think we should  --  extend the truce . " " Excellent . Does Fanchon agree ? " " She needs help now . A  --  she is in thrall to a leth- argy tree . " " Oho ! Then I shall repay your favor by rescuing the damsel . Then we shall talk of truce . " And Trent jumped up . On the way up the beach , Bink pointed out the vine tree , and Trent whipped out his sword and neatly lopped off a length of vine . Again Bink was reminded of the skill this man had with his physical weapon ; ifTrent 's magic were taken away entirely , he would still be dangerous . In fact , he had risen to the generalship of an army , in Mundania . The vine twisted into shuddering convolutions like adying serpent , oozing orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tree keened again , cowed . BinK almost felt sorry for it . They took this vine to Fanchon , looped it about her foot , and hauled her unceremoniously away from the tree . So simple with the right equipment ! " Now , " Trent said briskly as Fanchon slowly re- covered her vital energy . " I propose an extended truce between us , until we three escape the wilderness ofXanth . We seem to have problems separately . " This time Fanchon acquiesced.  |p232The  first thing Fanchon did when she recoveredwas fetch the magic gourd Bink had told her about . " This could be useful , " she said , wrapping it in a great leaf from a blanket plant . " Now we must plan the best route out of here , " Trent said . " I believe we are south of the chasm , so that will balk us if we go north  --  unless we remain on the coast . I do n't think that is wise . " Bink remembered his experience crossing the chasm at the other side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach , " he agreed . The Sorceress Iris had complicated things there  --  but there could be equivalent menaces here . " Our alternative is to cut inland , " Trent said . " I am not familiar with this specific locale , but I believe Humfreywas building a castle due east of here . " " He completed it , " Fanchon said . " Fine , " Bink said . " You can change us into big birds , maybe rocs , and we 'll carry you there . " Trent shook his head negatively . " This is not feasi-ble . " " But you changed us before , and we helped you . We made the truce ; we would n't drop you . " Trent smiled . " It is not a question of trust , Bink . Itrust you ; I have no question at all about your basicintegrity , or Fanchon 's . But we are in a peculiar cir-cumstance  --  " " Fancy the Evil Magician paying a call on the Goodp233Magician ! " Fanchon said . " What a scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disappointed , " Trent said . " Hum- frey and I have always gotten along well . We leave each other alone professionally . I should be happy to meet him again . But he would be obliged to convey the news of my return to Xanth to the King , and once he knew my general whereabouts he would use his magic to keep track of me . " " Yes , I see the problem , " she said . " No sense tipping your hand to the enemy . But we could fly somewhere else . " " We can fly nowhere , " Trent insisted . " I can not af- ford to advertise my presence in Xanth  --  and neither can you . " " That 's right , " Bink agreed . " We 're exiles . And the penalty for violating exile  --  " " Is death , " Fanchon finished . " I never thought  --  we 're all in trouble . " " If you had forgotten such details two days ago , " Trent observed wryly , " we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if there wetre some special significance to the remark . Oddly , the ex- pression made her look less ugly than usual . Probably , Bink thought , he was merely getting used to her . " What are we going to do ? " Bink asked . " The whirl- pool brought us in under the Shield ; we 've already agreed we ca n't go back that way . We ca n't stay here onthe beach  --  and we ca n't let the citizens know we'reback , even though we entered only by freak accident . " " We 'll have to conceal our identifies , " Fanchon de- cided . " There are places in Xanth where we would be unknown . " " That does n't sound like much of a life , " Bink said . " Always in hiding  --  and if anyone asked Magician Humfrey where we were  --  " " Who 'd do that ? " Fanchon demanded . " One year 's service just to check up on someone in exile ? " " That is our only present margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humfrey will not bother to check without a potential fee . However , we can worry about such things after we escape the wilderness . Perhaps by then some new avenues will have appeared . I can change you into unrecognizable forms , if necessary , and camouflage myself . It may all prove to be academic . " Because they might never make it through the wilderness , Bink thought . They traveled along the beach until they found a regionof sparse forest and field that seemed less hazardousthan the rest . They spaced themselves out somewhat whenever anything dangerous appeared , so that they would not all be caught together . The selection worked well enough ; at first the magic they encountered was largely innocuous , as if the concentration were all at the beach . There were spells designed to make passing animalssheer off , or color shows whose purpose was unclear . Bink had been through worse on his trip to the Good Magician 's castle . Maybe the wilderness was overrated . Fanchon spotted a fabric plant and efficiently fashionedtogas for them all . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nudity . Had Fanchon been a provocatively proportioned woman there might have been more reason  --  and less desirebodily concealment . Still , Bink remembered how she had professed modesty in the prison pit so as to gain a private section in which to hide the bricks . She probably had her reasons this time , too . There were several patches . of spell-cast coldness , and one of heat ; the clothing would have helped protect against these , but they were easy to avoid . The assorted carnivorous trees were readily spotted and bypassed ; staying off attractive paths was second nature to them all now . One region was distinctly awkward , however . It was dry and sandy , with little apparent nutrient in the soil , yet it was covered by luxuriant waist-high broad-leavedp235plants . The region seemed harmless , so they strode straight through the center . Then all three travelers felta sudden and almost uncontrollable call of nature . Theyhad to scatter , barely getting separated in time to perform . These were very practical plants , Bink abruptly realized . Their spells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soil , greatly promotingplant growth . Fertilizer magic ! Farther along , one animal neither fled their approach nor acted hostile . This was a knee-high , snuffling quadrupedwith a greatly extended snout . Trent drew his sword as it ambled toward them , but Fanchon stopped him . " I recognize that one , " she said . " It 's a magic-sniffer . " " It smells by magic ? " Bink asked . " It smells magic , " she said . " We used to use one on my folks ' farm , to sniff out magic herbs and things . The stronger the magic , the more it reacts . But it 's harmless . " " What does it feed on ? " Trent asked , keeping his hand on his sword . " Magic berries . Other magic does n't seem to affect it one way or the other ; it is just curious . It does n't differentiateby type of spell , just intensity . " They stood and watched . Fanchon was nearest to the sniffer , so it approached her first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See , I have some magic ; it likes me , " she said . What magic ? Bink wondered . She had never shown any talent , and never actually told him what she could do . There was still too much he did not know about her . Satisfied , the sniffer moved on to Trent . This time its reaction was much stronger ; it danced around , emitting a medley of notes . " Sure enough , " Trent said , with a certainjustified pride . " It knows a Magician when it smells one . " Then it came to Bink  --  and frisked almost as muchp236as it had for Trent . " So much for perception , " Bink said , laughing with embarrassment . But Trent did not laugh . " It believes you are almos  --  as strong a magician as I am , " he said , his fingers tap ping his sword with unconscious significance . Then h caught himself , and seemed to be at ease again . " I wish I were , " Bink said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Magician Humfrey had told him he had very strong magic that could not be brought out . Now his curiosity and frustration were increased b this happenstance . What kind of a talent could he have that hid itself so determinedly  --  or was it hidden by some outside spell ? They trudged on . They cut poles with which to poke the ground ahead for invisible barriers and pitfalls and other suspiciously unsuspect aspects of the wild . This made progress slow  --  but they dared not hurry . Ac tually , they had no reason to hurry ; their only purposes , were concealment and survival . Food turned out to be no problem . They did not trust the various fruit and candy trees they saw ; some might be magic , and serve the interests of their hosts rather than the interests of the consumers , though they looked similar to crop trees . But Trent merely turned a hostile thistle tree into a luxuriant multifruit tree , and the ; feasted on apples , pears , bananas , blackberries , and to matoes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magician , for Trent 's talent really embraced that of food conjuration as a mere subtalent . Properly exploited , the reach of his magic was enormous . But they were still heading into the wilderness , no , out of it . Illusions became bolder , more persistent , anc harder to penetrate . There were more sounds , louder more ominous . Now and then the ground shuddered and there were great not-too-distant bellowings . Treesleaned toward them , leaves twitching . " I think , " Fanchon said , " we have not begun to appreciate the potency of this forest . Its whole **25;3934;TOOLONG may have been merely to encourage us to get more deeply in . " Bink , looking nervously about , agreed . " We pickedt the safest-seeming route . Maybe that 's where we went wrong . We should have taken the most threatening one . " " And gotten consumed by a tangle tree , " Fanchon said . " Let 's try going back , " Bink suggested . Seeing their doubt , he added : " Just to test . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More trees appeared , blocking the way they had come ; were they illusions , or had they been invisible before ? Bink was reminded of the onewaypath he had walked from the Good Magician 's castle , but this was more ominous . These were not nice trees ; they were gnarled colossi bearing thorns and twitching vines . Branches crisscrossed one another , leaves sprouting to form new barriers even as the trio watched . Thunder rumbled in the distance . " No doubt about it , " Trent said . " We failed to see the forest for the trees . I could transform any in our direct path , but if some started firing thorns at us we would be in trouble regardless . " " Even if we wanted to go that way , " Fanchon said , looking west . " We 'd never have time to retrace it all through that resistance . Not before night . " Night-that was the worst time for hostile magic . " But the alternative is to go the way it wants us to go , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but it surely is not our best choice . " " Perhaps the wilderness does not know us well enough , " Trent said with a grim smile . " I do feel competentto handle most threats , so long as someone watches behind me and stands guard as I sleep . " Bink thought of the Magician 's powers of magic and swordplay , and had to agree . The forest might be one giant spider web  --  but that spider might become a gnat , unexpectedly . " Maybe we should gamble that we canp238handle it , " Bink said . " At least we 'll find out what it is . " For the first time , he was glad to have the Evil Magicianalong . " Yes , there is always that , " Fanchon agreed sourly . Now that they had made the decision , progress be came easier . The threatenings of the forest remained , but they assumed the aspect of background warnings . As dust came , the way opened out into a clearing , within which stood an old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanchon exclaimed . " Not a haunted cas-tle ! " Thunder cracked behind them . A chill wind came up , cutting through their tunics . Bink shivered . " I think we : spend the night there  --  or in the rain , " he said . " Could you transform it into a harmless cottage ? " " My talent applies only to living things , " Trent said . " That excludes buildings  --  and storms . " Glowing eyes appeared in the forest behind them . " Ii ' those things rush us , " Fanchon said , " you could onl ; transform a couple before they were on us , since yot , ca n't zap them from a distance . " " And not at night , " Trent said . " Remember  --  I have to see my subject , too . All things considered , I think we . had better oblige the local powers that be and enter the castle . Carefully  --  and once inside , we should sleep in shifts . It is likely to be a difficult night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend the night was there  --  but he realized they had come fa : too deeply into the'trap to extricate themselves readily There was powerful magic here , the magic of an entire region . Too much to fight directly  --  now . So they yielded , goaded by the looming storm . The ramparts were tall , but covered by moss and clinging vines . The drawbridge was down , its once-stout timbers rotting in place . Yet there was an ancient , lingering , rugged magnificence about it . " This castle has style , " Trent observed . They tapped the planks , locating a reasonably solid section on which to cross . The moat was overgrown ; ,  |p239with  weeds , and its water was stagnant . " Shame to see a good castle get run down , " Trent said . " It is obviously deserted , and has been for decades . " " Or centuries , ' ; Bink added . " Why would a forest herd us into a derelict edifice ? " Fanchon asked . " Even if something really horrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We were only passing through  --  and we would make it much faster if the forest just left us alone . We intend it no harm . " " There is always a rationale , " Trent said . " Magic does not focus without purpose . " They approached the front portcullis as the storm broke . That encouraged them to step inside , though the interior was almost black . " Maybe we can find a torch , " Fanchon said . " Feel along the walls . Usually a castle will have something near the entrance  --  " Crash ! The raised portcullis , which they had assumedwas corroded in place , crashed down behind them . The iron bars were far too heavy to lift ; the three were trapped inside . " The jaws close , " Trent remarked , not seeming perturbed . But Bink could see that his sword was in his hand . Fanchon made a half-muffled scream , clutching at Bink 's arm . He looked ahead and saw a ghost . There was no question about it : the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a mouthless moan . Trent 's sword whistled as he stepped forward . The blade sliced through the sheet  --  with no visible effect . The ghost floated away through a wall . " This castle is haunted , no question , " Trent said matter-of-factly . " If you believed that , you would n't be so calm , " Fanchonsaid accusingly . " On the contrary . It is physical menaces I fear , " Trent replied . " The thing to remember about ghosts is that they have no concrete manifestation , and lack alsop240the ability of shades to animate living creatures . Thereforethey can not directly affect ordinary people . Thee act only through the fear they inspire  --  so it is mere ) necessary to have no fear . In addition , this particular ghost was as surprised to see us as we were to see it . 1 was probably merely investigating the fall of the porn cullis . It certainly meant no harm . " It was obvious that Trent was not afraid . He had no+ used his sword in panic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was courage of a type Bink had never had ; he was shivering with fear and reaction . Fanchon had better control , now that her initial scream was out . " We could fall into quite physical pits or set off more boobytraps if we tried to explore this place in the dark . We 're sheltered from the rain here  --  why do n't we sleep right here in shifts until morning ? " " You have marvelous common sense , my dear , " Trent said . " Shall we draw straws for first watch ? " " I 'll take it , " Bink said . " I 'm too scared to sleep any-way . " " So am I , " Fanchon said , and Bink felt warm gratitude for her admission . " I have not yet become blase about ghosts . " " There is not enough evil in you , " Trent said , chuckling . " Very well ; I shall be first to sleep . " He moved , and Bink felt something cool touch his hand . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through whatever manifests . If it has no impact , relax , for it is a true ghost ; if it contacts anything material , that threat will no doubt be abated by the thrust . Only take care "  --  and Bink heard the smile in his voice  --  " that you do not strike the wrong subject . " " IBink found himself holding the heavy sword , amazed . " Do not be concerned about your inexperience with the weapon ; a straight , bold thrust will have authority regardless , " Trent continued reassuringly . " When your watch is done , pass the blade on to the lady . When she is done , I will take my turn , being by then well rested . "  |p241Bink  heard him lie down . " Remember , " the Magician 's voice came from the floor . " My talent is void in the dark , since I can not see my subject . So do not wake me unnecessarily . We depend on your alertness and judgment . " He said no more . Fanchon found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " she said . " I do n't want you running me through by accident . " Bink was glad for her closeness . He stood peering about , sword in one sweaty hand , staff in the other , unable to penetrate the dark . The sound of the rain outsidebecame loud ; then he made out Trent 's gentle snoring . " Bink ? " Fanchon said at last . " Um . " " What kind of a man would give his enemy his sword and go to sleep ? " That question had been bothering Bink . He had no satisfactory answer . " A man with iron nerve , " he said at last , knowing that that could only be part of it . " A man who extends such trust , " she said thoughtfully , " must expect to receive it . " " Well , if we 're trustworthy and he is n't , he knows he can trust us . " " It does n't work that way , Bink . It is the untrustworthyman who distrusts others , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how a documented liar and villain and schemer for the throne like the Evil Magiciancan be this way . " " Maybe he 's not the historical Trent , but someone else , an imposter  --  " " An imposter would still be a liar . But we 've seen his power . Magic is never twice the same ; he has to be Trent the Transformer . " " Yet something is wrong . " " Yes . Something is right ; that 's what 's wrong . He trusts us , and he should n't . You could run him through right now , while he sleeps ; even if you did n't kill himp242with the first thrust , he could not transform you in the dark . " " I would n't do that ! " Bink exclaimed , horrified . " Precisely . You have honor . So do I. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that so does he . Yet we know he is the Evil Magician . " " He must have spoken the truth before , " Bink decided . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he figures he 'll need help to get out of this haunted castle in one piece , and he knows we ca n't get out alive either , so we 're all on the same side and wo n't hurt each other . So he 's serious about the truce . " " But what about when we get out of all this and the truce ends ? " Bink did n't answer . With that they were silent . But his troubled thoughts continued . If they survived the night in this dread castle , they could probably survive the day . In the morning Trent might figure the truce was over . Bink and Fanchon could guard the Magician through the night ; then in the morning Trent could slay them both while they slept . If Trent had taken the first watch , he could not have done that , because he would have to slay the people who would protect him for the remainder of the evening . So it made sense to take the last watch . No . He was not ready to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to have faith in the sanctity of the truce . If that faith was misplaced , then he was lost  --  but he would rather lose that way than to win through dishonor . That decision gave him comfort . Bink saw no more ghosts that night . At last he gave the sword to Fanchon . To his surprise , he managed to sleep . He woke at dawn . Fanchon was asleep beside him ; . looking less ugly than he recalled  --  in fact , not reall homely at all . He certainly was acclimatizing . Would it ever come to the point where Trent seemed noble anc Fanchon beautiful ? " Good , " Trent said . He was wearing his sword again.  | " Now that you can look out for her , I 'll have a look around the premises . " He walked on down the dim hall . They had survived the night . Bink was n't sure in retrospectwhether he had been more worried about theghosts or the Magician . He still lacked comprehensionof the motives of either . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her appearance had improved . She could hardly be called lovely , but she certainly was not the ugly girl he had perceived when he met her four days ago . In fact , she now reminded him of someone " Dee ! " he exclaimed . She woke . " Yes ? " Her response amazed him as much as the vague resemblance . He had called her Dee  --  but Dee was elsewherein Xanth . Why , then , had she answered to that name as if it were her own ? " I  --  I just thought you  --  " She sat up . " You 're right , of course , Bink . I knew I could n't conceal it much longer . " " You mean you actually are . . . ? " " I am Chameleon , " she said . Now he was totally confused . " That was only a code word we used , to alert  --  " And an omen . . . " I am Fanchon-ugly , " she said . " And Dee-average . And Wynne-beautiful . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of a month . A lunar month . It 's the female cycle , you know . " Now he remembered how Dee too had reminded him of someone . " But Wynne was stupid ! You  --  " " My intelligence varies inversely , " she explained . " That is the other facet of my curse . I range from ugly intelligence to lovely idiocy . I 've been looking for a spell to turn me normal . " " A spell for Chameleon , " he said musingly . What an astonishing enchantment . Yet it had to be true , for he had almost caught the similarity when he met Dee , so close to where he had lost Wynne , and now he had seen Fanchon change day by day . Chameleon  --  she had nop244magic talent ; she was magic , like the centaurs or dragons . " But why did you follow me into exile ? " " Magic does n't work outside Xanth . Humfrey told me I would gradually center on my normal state if I went to Mundania . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed my best choice . " " But you said you followed me . " " I did . You were kind to Wynne . My mind may change , but my memory does n't . You saved her from the Gap dragon at great peril to yourself , and you did n't take advantage of her when she  --  you know . " Bink remembered the beautiful girl 's willingness to disrobe . She had been too stupid to think through the likely consequence of her offer  --  but Dee and Fanchon , later , would have understood . " And now I know you tried to help Dee , also . She  --  I should n't have cut you off then  --  but we were n't as smart then as later . And we did n't know you as well . You  --  " She broke off . " It does n't matter . " But it did matter ! She was not one but three of the girls he had known  --  and one of those was excruciatinglybeautiful . But also stupid . How should he react to this  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the magic lizardthat changed its color and shape at will , mimicking other creatures . If only he could forget that omen  --  or be sure he understood it . He was sure this Chameleon meant him no harm , but she might in fact be the death of him . Her magic was involuntary , but it dominated her life . She had a problem , certainly  --  and so did he . So she had learned that he was to be exiled for lack of magic and made her decision . Dee without magic , Bink without magic  --  two ordinary people with a commonmemory of the land of magic-perhaps the only thing to sustain them in drear Mundania . No doubt her smart phase had figured that out . What an apt couple they could make , these two demagicked souls . So she had acted  --  but had had no way of knowing about the ambush set by the Evil Magician . It had been a good notion . Bink liked Dee . She wasp245not so ugly as to turn him off , and not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabrina and the Sorceress Iris  --  what was the matter with beautifulwomen , that they could not be constant ?  --  but also not so stupid as to make it pointless . Just a reasonable com- promise , an average girl he could have loved  --  especially in Mundania . But now they were back in Xanth , and her curse was in force . She was not simple Dee , but complex Chameleon , swinging from extreme to extreme , when all he wanted was the average . " I 'm not so stupid yet that I ca n't figure out what 's going through your mind , " she said . " I 'm better off in Mundania . " Bink could not deny it . Now he almost wished it had worked out that way . To have settled down with Dee , raised a family  --  that could have been its own special brand of magic . There was a crash . Both reacted , orienting on the sound . It had come from somewhere above . " Trent 's in trouble ! " Bink said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must be stairs somewhere  --  " Behind his immediate consciousness he realized that this reaction indicated a fundamental change in his attitude toward the Magician . That night with the sword and the sleeping man  --  if evil was as evil did , Trent could not be very evil . Trust compelled trust . Maybe the Magician was only trying to manipulate Bink 's attitude ; regardless , that attitude had suffered a fundamentalerosion . Chameleon followed . Now that it was light , they had no fear of pitfalls , though Bink knew there could be magic ones . There was a grandly curving stone staircase beyond a palatial room . They charged up this . Suddenly a ghost loomed up . " O0000 ! " it moaned. its great eye holes staring like holes in a dark coffin . " Get out of my way ! " Bink snapped , swinging his pole at it . The ghost , nonplused , phased out . Bink ran through its remnant , feeling the momentary chill of itsp246presence . Trent was right : there was no need to fear the insubstantial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no illusions in this old castle , just its harmless resident spooks . That was a relief after the way they had been herded into it last night . But now there was silence upstairs . Bink and Chameleonpicked their way through surprisingly opulent and well-preserved chambers , searching for their companion . At another time Bink would have admired the arrangementsand tapestries of the rooms and halls at leisure , and been glad of the tight roof that had protected them from rain and weathering and rot , but right now his attention was preempted by concern . What had happened to Trent ? If there were some monster lurking in this castle , summoning its victims by magicThen they found a kind of upstairs library . Fat old . books and coiled scrolls were filed on shelves along the walls . In the center , at a polished wood table , sat Trent , poring over an open tome . " Another peephole spell 's got him ! " Bink cried . But Trent lifted his head . " No , merely the thirst for knowledge , Bink . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But the crash  --  " Bink started . Trent smiled . " My fault . That old chair gave way undermy weight . " He pointed to a tangle of wood . " Much of the furniture here is fragile . I was so interested in this library that I was thoughtless . " He rubbed his backside reminiscently . " I paid for it . " " What 's so fascinating about the books ? " Chameleon asked . " This one is a history of this castle , " Trent explained . " It is not , it seems , just another artifact . This is Castle Roogna . " " Roogna ! " Bink exclaimed . " The Magician King of the Fourth Wave ? " " The same . He ruled from here , it seems . When he died and the Fifth Wave conquered Xanth , eightp247hundred years ago , his castle was deserted , and finally forgotten . But it was a remarkable structure . Much of the King 's nature imbued the environs ; the castle had an identity of its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Roogna 's talent  --  " " Was the conversion of magic to his own purposes , " Trent said . " A subtle but powerful asset . He was the ultimate tamer of the forces around him . He cultivated the magic trees around here , and he built this fine castle . During his reign Xanth was in harmony with its populace . It was a kind of Golden Age . " " Yes , " Bink agreed . " I never thought I 'd see this famoushistorical place . " " You may see more of it than you want to , " Trentsaid . " Remember how we were guided here ? " " It seems like only yesterday , " Bink said wryly . " Why were we herded here ? " Chameleon demanded . Trent glanced at her , his gaze lingering . " I believe this locale behooves you , Fanchon . " " Never mind that , " she said . " I 'll be a lot prettier before I 'm through , more 's the pity . " " She is Chameleon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty and back again  --  and her intelligence varies inversely . She left Xanth to escape that curse . " " I would not regard that as a curse , " the Magician commented . " All things to all men  --  in due course . " " You 're not a woman , " she snapped . " I asked about this castle . " Trent nodded . " Well , this castle requires a new resident . A Magician . It is very selective , which is one reasonit has lain dormant for so many centuries . It wants to restore the years of its glory ; therefore it must supporta new King of Xanth . " " And you 're a Magician ! " Bink exclaimed . " Sowhen you came near , everything shoved you this way . " " So it would seem . There was no malign intent , merely an overwhelming need . A need for CastleRoogna , and a need for Xanth  --  to make this landp248again what it could be , a truly organized and excellent kingdom . " " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . " There was a very positive quality to the statement . Bink and Chameleon looked at each other in developingcomprehension . So the Evil Magician had reverted to form  --  assuming he had ever changed his form . They had discussed his human qualities , his seeming nobility , and been deceived . He had planned to invade Xanth , and now " Not ever ! " she flared . " The people would never toleratea criminal like you . They have n't forgotten  --  " " So you do have prior knowledge of my reputation , " Trent said mildly . " I had understood you to say you had not heard of me . " He shrugged . " However , the good citizens of Xanth may not have much choice , and it would not be the first time a criminal has occupied e throne , " he continued calmly . " With the powers of thi . castle  --  which are formidable  --  added to mine , I may not need an army . " " We 'll , stop you , " Chameleon said grimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you terminating the truce ? " That gave her pause . The end of the truce would pua the two of them directly in Trent 's power , if what he said about this castle was true . " No , " she said . " But when it does end . . . " There was no hint of malignancy in Trent 's smile . " Yes , it seems there will have to be a settlement . I had thought if I allowed you to go your way , you woulc extend the same courtesy to me . But when I said the people of Xanth would not necessarily have a choice , did not mean it precisely the way you seem to have . taken it . This castle may not permit us to do other thar its will . For centuries it has endured here , hanging or against inevitable deterioration , waiting for a Magician of sufficient strength to qualify . Perhaps the magicsnifferwe encountered in the forest was one of its rep/resentatives . Now it has found not one but two Magi. cians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here wf may be bound to glory  --  or extinction , depending or our decision . " " Two Magicians ? " she asked . " Remember , Bink has almost as much magic as I do . That was the verdict of the sniffer , and I am not certain it was mistaken . That would place him comfortably in the Magician class . " " But I have no talent , " Bink protested . " Correction , " Trent said . " To have an unidentified talent is hardly synonymous with having no talent . But even if you are talentless , there is strong magic associated with you . You may be magic , as is Fanchon . " " Chameleon , " she said . " That 's my real name ; the others are merely phases . " " I beg your pardon , " Trent said , making a little sittingbow to her . " Chameleon . " " You mean I 'll change somehow ? " Bink asked , half hopeful , half appalled . " Perhaps . You might metamorphose into some superiorform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused . " Sorry  --  that 's another Mundane reference ; I do n't believechess is known in Xanth . I have been too long in exile . " " Well , I still wo n't help you try to steal the crown , " Bink said stoutly . " Naturally not . Our purposes differ . We may even be rivals . " " I 'm not trying to take over Xanth ! " " Not consciously . But to prevent an Evil Magician from doing so , would you not consider . . . ? " " Ridiculous ! " Bink said , disgruntled . The notion was preposterous , yet insidious . If the only way to prevent Trent from  --  no ! " The time may indeed have come for us to part , " Trent said . " I have appreciated your company , but the situation seems to be changing . Perhaps you should attempt to leave this castle now . I shall not oppose you.  |p250Should  we manage to separate , we can consider the truce abated . Fair enough ? " " How nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your books while the jungle tears us up . " " I do not think anything here will actually hurt you , " Trent said . " The theme of Castle Roogna is harmony with man . " He smiled again . " Harmony , not harm . But I rather doubt you will be permitted to depart . " Bink had had enough . " I 'll take my chances . Let 's go " " You want me to come along ? " Chameleon asked hesitantly . " Unless you prefer to stay with him . You might make a very pretty Queen in a couple of weeks . " Trent laughed . Chameleon moved with alacrity . They walked to the stairs , leaving the Magician poring over his book again . Another ghost intercepted them . This one seemed larger than the others , more solid . " Waarrningg , " it moaned . Bink stopped . " You can speak ? What is your warn-ing ? " " D000m beeyonnd . Staay . " " Oh . Well , that 's a chance we 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are loyal to Xanth . " " Xaaanth ! " the spirit repeated with a certain feeling . " Yes , Xanth . So we must leave . " The ghost seemed nonplused . It faded . " It almost seems they 're on our side , " Chameleon commented . " Maybe they 're just trying to make us stay in the castle , though . " " We ca n't afford to trust ghosts , " Bink agreed . They could not exit through the front gate , because the portcullis was firm and they did not understand the mechanism for lifting it . They poked through the downstairsrooms , searching for an alternate exit . Bink opened one promising door  --  and slammed it shut as a host of leather-winged , long-toothed creaturesp251stirred ; they looked like vampire bats . He cracked th next open more carefully  --  and a questing rope twine4 out , more than casually reminiscent of the tree vines . " Maybe the cellar , " Chameleon suggested , spyin ; stairs leading down . They tried it . But at the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were facing , not fleeing , the intruders . The beasts looked too hungry , too confident they surely had magic to trap any prey that enterec their territory . Bink poked his staff at the nearest , experimentally " Scat ! " he exclaimed . But the rat leaped onto the pole climbing up toward Bink 's hands . He shook it , but the creature clung , and another jumped to the staff . He thunked it against the stone floor , hard  --  but still they hung on , and still they climbed . That must be their magic  --  the ability to cling . " Bink ! Above ! " Chameleon cried . There was a chittering overhead . More rats were crowding the beams , bracing themselves to leap . Bink threw the staff away and backed hastily up the stairs , holding on to Chameleon for support until he could get turned around . The rats did not follow . " This castle is really organized , " Bink said as they emerged on the main floor . " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to try . Maybe a win-dow . " But there were no windows on the ground floor ; the outer wall had been built to withstand siege . No point in jumping from an upper turret ; someone would surely break a bone . They moved on , and found themselves in the kitchen area . Here there was a back exit , normally used for supplies , garbage , and servants . They slipped out and faced a small bridge across the moat : an ideal escape route . But there was motion on the bridge already . Snakes were emerging from the rotten planking . Not healthy , normal reptiles , but tattered , discolored things whose bones showed through oozing gaps in the sagging flesh.  | " Those are zombie snakes ! " Chameleon cried with genuine horror . " Waked from the dead . " " It figures , " Bink said grimly . " This whole castle is waked from the dead . Rats can thrive anywhere , but the other creatures died out when the castle died , or maybe they come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong as real living things ; we can probably handle them with our staffs . " But he had lost his own staff in the cellar . Now he smelled the stench of corruption , worse than that of the harpy . Waves of it rose from the festering snakes and the putrescent moat . Bink 's stomach made an exploratory heave . He had seldom encountered genuine , far-advanced decay ; usually either creatures were living or their bones were fairly neat and clean . The stages in between , of spoilage and maggot infestation and disintegration , were a part of the cycle of life and death he had chosen not to inspect closely . Hitherto . " I do n't want to try that bridge , " Chameleon said . " We 'll fall through  --  and there are zombie crocs in the water . " So there were : big reptiles threshing the slimy surface with leather-covered bones , their worm-eaten eyes gazingup . " Maybe a boat , " Bink said . " Or a raft  --  " " Uh-uh . Even if it were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look across the water . " He looked . Now came the worst of all , walking jerkilyalong the far bank of the moat : human zombies , some mummified , others hardly more than animate skeletons . Bink watched the awful things for a long moment , fascinated by their very grotesqueness . Fragments of wrappings and decayed flesh dropped from them . Some dribbled caked dirt left from their over-hasty emergence from their unquiet graves . It was a parade of putrefaction . He thought of fighting that motley army , hacking apart already-destroyed bodies , feeling their rotting ,  |p253vermin-riddled  flesh on his hands , wrestling with those ghastly animations , saturated with the cloying stink of it all . What loathsome diseases did they bear , what gan- grenous embraces would they bestow on him as they fell apart ? What possible attack would make these molderingdead lie down again ? The spell-driven things were closing in , coming across the ragged bridge . Surely this was even worse for the zombies , for they could not voluntarily have roused themselves . They could not retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed into service in this state , instead of remaining in the bliss of oblivion " I  --  do n't think I 'm ready to leave yet , " Bink said . " No , " Chameleon agreed , her face somewhat green . " Not this way . " And the zombies halted , giving Bink and Chameleon time to reenter Castle Roogna . Chameleon was now well through her " normal " phase , which Bink had known before as Dee , and moving into her beauty phase . It was not identical to the prior Wynne ; her hair was lighter in color , and her features subtly different . Apparently she varied in her physical details each cycle , never exactly repeating herself , but always proceeding from extreme to extreme . Unfortunately , she was also becoming less intelligent , and was no help on the problem of escaping the castle . She was much more interested now in getting friendly with Bink  --  and this was a distraction he felt he could not afford at the moment.  |p254First  , his priority was to get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure he wanted to associate himself in any permanent way with so changeable an entity . If only she were beautiful and bright  --  but no , that would not work either . He realized now why she had not been tempted by Trent 's offer to make her beautiful , when they were first captured outside the Shield . That would merely have changed her phase . If she were beautiful when she was smart , she would be stupid when she was ugly , and that was no improvement . She needed to be free of the curse entirely . And even if she could be fixed permanently at the height of both beauty and brains , he would not trust her , for he had been betrayed by that type too . Sabrina  --  he choked off that memory . Yet even an ordinary girl could get pretty dull if she had no more than ordinary intelligence or magic . . . Castle Roogna , now that they were not actively opposingit , was a fairly pleasant residence . It did its best to make itself so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grains , vegetables , and small game ; Trent practiced his archery by bringing down rabbits , shooting from the high embrasures , using one of the fine bows in the castle armory . Some of the creatureswere false rabbits , projecting images of themselves a bit apart from their actual locations , causing him to waste arrows , but Trent seemed to enjoy the challenge . One he nabbed was a stinker , whose magic aroma was such that there was nothing to do but bury the carcass in a hurry , very deep . Another was a shrinker ; as it died it diminished in size until it was more like a mouse , hardly usable . Magic always had its little surprises . But some were good . The kitchen did need some attention ; otherwise the zombies would come in to do the cooking . Rather than permit that , Chameleon took over . Assisted by advice from the lady ghosts , who were very particular about Castle Roogna cuisine , she made creditable meals . She had no trouble with the dishes , since there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p255and  everything sparkled . In fact , having a bath in that water was quite an experience ; it effervesced . The inner partitions of the castle were as solid as the roof ; there seemed to be weatherproofing spells in operation . Each person had an opulent private bedroom with costly draperies on the walls , moving rugs on the floors , quivering goose-down pillows and solid-silver chamberpots . They all lived like royalty . Bink discovered that the embroidered tapestry on the wall opposite his bed was actually a magic picture : the little figures moved , playing out their tiny dramas with intriguing detail . Miniature knights slew dragons , tiny ladies sewed , and in the supposed privacy of interior chambers those knights and ladies embraced . At first Bink closed his eyes to those scenes , but soon his natural voyeurism dominated , and he watched it all . And wished that he could but no , that would not be proper , though he knew that Chameleon was willing . The ghosts were no problem ; they even became familiar . Bink got to know them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on them that first night when the portcullis crashed down ; another was the chambermaid ; a third was the cook 's assistant . There were six in all , each of whom had died inappropriately and so lacked proper burial rites . They were shades , really , but without proper volition ; only the King of Xanth could absolve them , and they could not leave the castle . So they were doomed to serve here forever , unable to perform their accustomed chores . They were basically nice people who had no control over the castle itself , and constituted only an incidental part of its enchantment . They helped wherever they could , pitifully eager to please , telling Chameleon where to search for the new foods and telling Bink stories of their lives here in the Grand Old Days . They had been surprised and chagrined by the intrusion of living people at first , for they had been in isolation for centuries . But they realizedit was part of the imperative of the castle itself , and now they had adjusted.  |p256Trent  spent most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master all of its accumulated knowledge . At first Chameleon spent some time there too , interested in intellectualthings . But as she lost intelligence , she lost interest . Her researches changed ; now she looked avidly for some spell to make her normal . When the library did not provide that , she left it , to poke around the castle and grounds . So long as she was alone , no untoward things manifested : no rats , no carnivorous vines , no zombies . She was no prisoner here , only the men . She searched for sources of magic . She ate things freely , alarmingBink , who knew how poisonous magic could be . But she seemed to lead a charmed existence  --  charmed by Castle Roogna . One of her discoveries was serendipitous : a small red fruit growing plentifully on one of the garden trees . Chameleon tried to bite into one , but the rind was tough , so she took it to the kitchen to chop it in half with a cleaver . No ghosts were present ; they generally appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have warning about the nature of this fruit . She was careless , and dropped one of the fruits on the floor . Bink heard the explosion and came running . Chameleon , quite pretty now , was huddling in a corner of the kitchen . " What happened ? " Bink demanded , looking about for hostile magic . " Oh , Bink ! " she cried , turning to him with woeful relief . Her homemade dress was in disarray , exposing her finely formed breasts above and her firm round thighs below . What a difference a few days made ! She was not at the height of her loveliness , but she was quite adequate to the need . The need ? Bink found her in his arms , aware that she was eager to do any bidding he might make . It was difficultindeed to steel himself against the obvious , for she also had much of Dee in her  --  the aspect he had liked before he understood her nature . He could take herp257now , make love to her  --  and neither her stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he was not a casual lover , and he did not want 1 make any such commitment at this time , in this situ , tion . He pushed her away gently , the action requirir far more effort than he cared to show . " What ha ' pened ? " he asked again . " It  --  it banged , " she said . He had to remind himself that her diminishing met tality was the other face of her curse . Now it was easie to hold off her lush body . A body without a mind di not appeal to him . " What banged ? " " The cherry . " " The cherry ? " This was the first he had heard allot the new fruit . But after patient questioning , he elicite the story . " Those are cherry bombs ! " he exclaimed , compre hending . " If you had actually eaten one  --  " She was not yet so stupid as to misunderstand that " Oh , my mouth ! " " Oh , your head ! Those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milly was the chambermaid ghost . " She was busy . " What would a ghost be busy with ? Well , this was m time to explore that . " After this , do n't eat anything un less a ghost tells you it 's okay . " Chameleon nodded dutifully . Bink picked up a cherry cautiously and considered i1 It was just a hard little red ball , marked only where it stem had broken off . " Old Magician Roogna probabl used these bombs in warfare . He did n't like war , as understand it , but he never let his defenses grow soft Any attackers  --  why , one man on the ramparts with slingshot could decimate an army , lobbing these cherr bombs down . No telling what other trees there are i the arsenal . If you do n't stop fooling around wit strange fruits " I could blow up the castle , " she said , watching thp258dissipating smoke . The floor was scorched , and a table had lost a leg . " Blow up the castle . .. . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why do n't you bring in some more cherry bombs ? I 'd like to experiment with them . But be careful , very careful ; do n't knock or drop any . " " Sure , " she said , as eager to please as any ghost . " Very careful . " " And do n't eat any . " That was not quite a joke . Bink gathered cloth and string , and made bags of assortedsizes . Soon he had bag-bombs of varying power . He planted these strategically around the castle . One bag he kept for himself . " I think we are ready to depart Castle Roogna , " he said . " But first I have to talk with Trent . You stand here by the kitchen door , and if you see any zombies , throw cherries at them . " He was sure no zombie had the coordination to catch such a bomb and throw it back ; wormy eyes and rotting flesh necessarily had poor hand-eye integration . So they would be vulnerable . " And if you see Trent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that pile . Fast , before he gets within six feet of you . " And he pointed to a large bomb he had tied to a major support column . " Do you understand ? " She did n't , but he drilled her on it until she had itICI straight . She was to throw a cherry at anything she saw  --  except Bink himself . Now he was ready . He went up to the library to speak with the Evil Magician . His heart beat loudly within him , now that the moment of confrontation had come , but he knew what he had to do . A ghost intercepted him . It was Milly , the chambermaid , her white sheet arranged to resemble her working dress , her black-hole eyes somehow having the aspect of once-sultry humanity . The ghosts had become shapeless from sheer neglect and carelessness in the course of the past few centuries of isolation , but now that there was company they were shaping up into their proper forms.  |p259Another  week would have them back into people outlinesand people colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bink suspected Milly would turn out to be a rather pretty girl , and he wondered just how she had died . A liaison with a castle guest , then a stabbin by the jealous wife who discovered them ? " What is it , Milly ? " he asked , pausing . He had mined the castle , but he bore no malice toward its unfortunate denizens . He hoped his bluff would be effective , so that it would not be necessary to destroy the home of the ghosts , who really were not responsible for its grandiose mischief . " The King  --  private conference , " she said . Het speech was still somewhat windy , as it was hard for anentity with so little physical substance  --  hardly any ectoplasm  --  toenunciate clearly . But he could make itout . " Conference ? There 's nobody here but us , " he objected . " Or do you mean he 's on the pot ? " Milly blushed as well as she was able to . Though as chambermaid she had been accustomed to the chore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any reference to a person 's actual performance on them was uncouth . It was as if the substance were completelydivorced from the function . Perhaps she liked to believe that the refuse appeared magically overnight , untouched by human intestine . Magic fertilizer ! " No . " " Well , I 'm sorry , but I 'll have to interrupt him , " Bink said . " You see , I do n't recognize him as King , and I am about to depart the castle . " " Oh . " She put one foggily formed hand to her vague face in feminine misgiving . " But seee . " " Very well . " Bink followed her to the little chapel room adjacent to the library . It was actually an offshoot from the master bedroom , with no direct access to the library . But it had , as it turned out , a small window opening onto the library . Since the gloom of the unlil chapel was deeper than that of the other room , it wa. possible to see without being seen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becametougher because of Barbatov 's zeal , Levanter worked harder to soften the impact on the recruits , continuing to reduce the number of students reprimanded . But he worked in total secrecy . Many of the students , jealous of Levanter 's easy life and angered by his apparent complicity with the authorities , were hostile to him . They accused him of devising arduous training exercises while he himself did not take part in any of them . They blamed him for the deaths from overexertion of two students and for the unit 's inadequatemedical care and lack of recreational facilities . Barbatov knew the students resented Levanter , and as he became more and more dependent on his aide-de-camp , he too became petulant and resentful . Often , when he was drunk , he would threaten to send Levanter back to the tent . Levanter did not take Barbatov 's threats seriously ; it was obvious to him that the captain could not run the program alone , and that Barbatov knew it . One morning , Levanter was jolted awake before dawn by the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a helmet and a camouflage coat . A submachine gun dangled from his shoulder , and two heavy antitank grenades hung from his belt . Levanter rose from his bed as Barbatov marched around drunkenly , searching the room as if for missing evidence . Suddenlyhis eye fell on a dirty napkin lying on the floor . With a menacing glint in his eyes , he turned to Levanter . " What is this ? A restaurant ? A hotel ? " he screamed , gesturingIi toward the napkin , his face reddening with fury . " Clean up this mess . Now ! " he bellowed . Levanter jumped forward and bent down to pick up the napkin , but Barbatov shoved him aside . " Not with your hand ! Push it to the wall with your circumcised prick . " His words were slurred , his voice thick with vodka . Pretending not to understand , Levanter stood at attention . " I said , clean up this garbage with your stub of a pecker ! " Levanter did not move . Barbatov clenched and unclenched his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you in full attack gear . On the double ! " Levanter dressed under Barbatov 's scrutiny . There was hardly time for him to button his pants or lace his boots . He grabbed hisp51rifle and pack , clipped on the spade , and sprang to attention . " To the jeep , " Barbatov commanded . When they reached the training range , correctional-unit recruits were scattered all over the pitted terrain . Barbatov ordered all platoons to assemble along the obstacle course for a training demonstration . He shoved Levanter out of the jeep and kept him standing at attention while the troops gathered along the course . Barbatov stood up on his seat in the jeep . " This is Private Levanter , " he shouted into a bullhorn , pointing to the solitary figure . " Like all his people , he got himself a better bargain : he is in charge of planning your exercises , but you have to do them . You see , Levanter thinks he is too smart to do them himself . And because he is so smart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thick lips in a sneer , " Levanter will show you damn peasants how to do the exercises . " He looked down at Levanter and yelled , " Ready ? " Levanter saluted . He made his mind go blank . " Attack ! " screamed Barbatov , jumping out of the jeep . Crouchinglow , Levanter started to run , rifle in hand . " Machine-gun fire ! " barked Barbatov . Levanter somersaulted over the parapet into the wet , freshly turned soil of the nearest trench . His pack and spade slipped off , nearly tripping him , and he barely managed to pick them up before the next command came . " Attack ! " Already panting , Levanter clambered over the top of the trench . Just as he had begun to crawl forward , smelling the new grass , he heard Barbatov shout , " Hit the dirt ! " and he dropped back down into the mud , which spattered into his eyes and clung to his mouth . The rough strap of his new helmet cut into his chin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tanks . Dig in ! " Levanter pulled out his spade , but the blade was locked . The students lining the course hooted raucously , shouting insulting words of advice . Levanter began scooping up the lumpy soil with his hands . Again Barbatov screamed , " Attack ! " Levanter staggered to his feet . He was covered with mud and dirt and was having trouble breathing as his throat filled with phlegm and pain seared his chest . He tried to hurdle a trench but missed and fell into the crater . He scrambledp52out and rolled over into the next one . His head was bleeding now , and as he plunged up against the breastwork his vision blurred . He was attempting to leap over another trench when his legs gave way and he pitched headfirst into the hole . He came to slowly . In the distance he could hear the platoons marching away , the footsteps receding , the singing growing fainter . Filthy and aching all over , he found he was lying on Barbatov 's coat . The captain knelt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , then wiping the mud off his forehead and cheeks with a handkerchief . " There you are , silly boy , " he muttered , his face creased with worry . " All brains but no muscle ! " He grinned and urged Levanterto his feet , steering him toward the jeep . As he drove , he kept glancing apologetically at his passenger . In the barracks , he helped Levanter remove his gear . Then he went to his quarters and returned with several bottles of his best beer . One evening the following week , Barbatov completed the counterfeitingof a pass , winked at Levanter , and drove off to the village . At midnight , Levanter went into the captain 's room . As usual , Barbatov had not taken his service revolver or his Party card , and he had also left behind the large map of the forthcoming divisional maneuvers , marked SECRET . Levanter rolled up the black window shade . To attract the military police , he turned on the light . In minutes , a jeep pulled up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarters , calling Barbatov 's name . Levanter showed them his papers and , with a straight face , explained that Captain Barbatov had gone into town for the evening . One of the MPs immediately phoned regimentalheadquarters and was informed that Barbatov had no authorizationto leave the camp . The MPs confiscated the captain 's revolver , his Party card , the divisional maneuvers map , and several blank passes they found . Then they locked and taped the door and left without another word . The next morning Levanter was notified that Captain Barbatov was no longer in command of the correctional unit . Levanter was to assume the regular duties of a private . When he moved his gearp53to a tent , the other soldiers greeted him with contempt and ridicule , snickering at him because his protector had been caught reentering camp drunk , carrying a false pass , and was to be court-martialed . Later that same day , a sergeant entered the tent , called Levanter'sname , and ordered him to collect his gear . Levanter was sure his falsification of the rosters had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , he was driven to Barbatov 's barracks and ordered to report inside . A slender man stood looking out the window . Levanter announced his presence , and the officer turned to face him . He was a middle-aged major wearing a rumpled uniform . He acknowledged Levanter 's salute with a curt nod ; no expression showed on his lined face . " I ca n't find any correctional-unit training-program files or codes  --  only this cabalistic chart , " he said , gesturing toward the wall . " I am told that you worked closely with my predecessor , Captain Barbatov . " " I did , Major , " replied Levanter . The officer waited . Levanter said no more . " The program must go on , " the major said . " You will provide me with the same assistance that you gave Captain Barbatov . Understand ? " " Yes , sir ! " Levanter responded . " I will need a specific authorizationassigning me to your service . " The major handed him a typewritten document . " I happen to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed by the regimental commander . You need only type your name in the empty space . " Levanter knew he had to leave the East , but he knew also that he would need a profession that could support him in the West , a profession with a universal language . While he was finishing at thep54university after his army service , Levanter enrolled in night courses at a school of photography . Before long , he had built his own darkroom and chemical laboratory . In addition to his classes and darkroom work , he spent hours every week in the school 's library examining the catalogues and magazines that described advancements in photographic art and reproduced the work of well-known photographers . Levanter soon learned that photography by its very nature depended on imitating reality in an imaginative , subjective way , but that usually a photographer'stechnical style could easily be reproduced . To counteract imitations of his artistic methods , Levanter began to evolve his own techniques and a style that could not be readily copied . He used a camera adapted to his experiments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified or emulsions he made himself . Less than two years after he began the course , he was invited to exhibit his work at national and international salons of photography . His photographs were reproduced in art publications , won prizes and awards , and a one-man exhibit of his photographs was organized in the capital . He received offers to work for domestic and foreign manufacturers of photographic products and was invited to exhibit his photographs and to lecture abroad by several Western art societies . Convinced that his work would be the finest form of advertising for the export of domestic photographic products , the authorities granted Levanter a short-term passport for his trip to the West . During his last week in the Soviet Union , he walked through fields in the farthest suburb of Moscow and noticed remnants of the frail fence that had surrounded the tents of the traveling state circus . Now , in winter , the circus was gone , and the fence and field were abandoned . It was snowing . The whirling powder had whitewashed the outlines of the railing . Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black-and-white photograph . Around him , the air was growing blustery ; the winds seemed to have chosen the field as their arena , tumbling over each other , raising clouds of snow andp55puffing them away . He had difficulty holding the camera steady . A passer-by , hugging his coat , made his way along the wooden railing , which wound through the field like a frozen snake . Before the man vanished in the white squall , Levanter took the picture . The cold and wind bit into him . Levanter thought that if he died here , his frostbitten body would not be discovered until spring came and the snows melted . From far away came the sound of a motorcycle plowing through the drifts . Soon a burly state militia officer arrived , stopping his bike next to Levanter . The officer turned off the engine and removed his goggles . " Your papers , please , " he said in an even voice . " What have I done ? " asked Levanter . The officer looked from Levanter 's face to his camera . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of this field . Is that you ? " Levanter nodded . " Then your papers , please . " The officer extended his thickly gloved hand . Without a word , Levanter took off his glove and reached under his coat . After a moment of digging through layers of sweaters , he produced his student I.D . card . The officer glanced at the card , then silently put it in a leather bag hanging from his shoulder . He jerked his chin at Levanter 's camera . " Open your camera , Comrade , and expose the film , " he said . " But why ? " asked Levanter . " Because of what you photographed , " answered the officer patiently . " I photographed this field , " Levanter said , " the fence that crosses it , and an old man who walked past . " " What else ? " " What else is there , Comrade ? " said Levanter . " There is nothing else . Here , take my camera . Whatever you see through the viewer is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer pushed it back to him.  | " You are here , on one of the coldest days of the year , in the middle of a storm , just to take pictures of an empty field , a broken fence , and some old man passing by . " " I am ! " " That 's a lie ! " said the officer . " It 's the truth ! " said Levanter . " Tell the truth , or I 'll arrest you ! " Levanter tried to sound patient . " I took a picture of an old man against the fence and the fence against the field . That 's all . " The officer became very angry . " I wo n't listen to such crap anymore , " he said . " I know you photographed this field . " He paused . " But we both know that such a field , any field , could serve as a landing site  --  " He paused again , this time apparently for effect . " A landing site for , let 's say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would a Soviet judge believe that you did not ? Now , no more trickery . Take out the film ! " Levanter obeyed . Sheltering his camera from the snow with his coat , he opened it , pulling the entire roll off its spool and exposing it to the light . The corkscrew of film dangled from his hand . He let it go ; in an instant it was carried off by the wind and disappeared in the snow . Levanter returned to the field the following day . It was gray and cold . A man dragged himself along the fence , clutching his coat and , every few steps , tugging his hat lower . Seen through the viewfinder , the man 's figure , the fence , and the field already appeared as a finished photo . Levanter took the picture.  |p57As  a student , shortly before he left Moscow for America , Levanter had gone to a private screening of two prewar Soviet films starring a lovely young actress . She was so beautiful that Levanter went to considerable trouble to find her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped during the German occupation of Russia . Now , in New York , he was finally able to trace her through a Russian cultural foundation . As soon as he located the number , Levanter telephoned and told the actress how impressed he had been by her films . He implored her to see him and was thrilled when she agreed . They met several times for lunch or drinks or a stroll in the park . She was in her forties ; over two decades had passed since he had seen her films , but he still found her breathtaking . Levanter was so inhibited by her grace and sexual appeal that he was unable to steer their relationship in any direction ; he merely listened as she spoke her perfectly enunciated Russian . She recounted the episodes of her life , told him about her movie career and how it was abruptly curtailed by the war . She explained that she had never made another film and , ever since she had been in exile , first in France and then in America , she had worked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support her husband , whose deteriorating health had made him unemployable and now kept him housebound . Walking beside her , Levanter fantasized their being together in his apartment . He is crouching before her . Slowly , he is lifting her skirt , gently separating her legs , and then licking her flesh through her underwear until she squirms . He starts to pull down her panties and , with his mouth upon her flesh , guides her toward the bed . Suddenly , in his fantasy , he hears the actress murmuring , " Tell me , what shall I do for you ? " But here his passion ran into an obstacle : the Russian language . Could Onegin possibly tell Tatyana that he wanted to eat her ? Would Vronsky say to Anna Karenina , " I want you to suck me " ? Could Levanter speak such thoughts in the language of Turgenev and Pasternak to this dignified , educated woman ? He could not . In Russian , the language of his childhood and adolescence , he regressed to memories of parents and schoolteachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only in English could he name the nature of his desires ; his new language was the idiom of his manhood . " You do n't mind speaking Russian with me ? " asked the actress as they walked through the park . " Not at all , " Levanter answered , glancing at the outlines of her thighs . " You speak it so melodiously . " He raised his eyes to her breasts . " My English is so crude , so imprecise , " she said apologetically . They walked in silence . Then , in a burst of courage that startled even him , Levanter invited her to his apartment . " What for ? " Levanter caught his breath . " I have a collection of photographs I took in Russia , " he said . " They 're all mounted  --  too big and heavy to carry around . But I am certain you would appreciate them . " At the apartment , the actress sat on the narrow convertible sofa . He perched on a chair facing her . On the floor between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , one at ap59time . The actress studied each picture , occasionally asking him when and where it was taken , and then placed it on the cushion beside her , the growing pile diminishing Levanter 's chances of casually sliding next to her . He grew tense and uneasy , aware of every move he made . He could n't figure out what to do . The convertible sofa was the only bed in his small apartment . Should he go over and take the pile of photographs away ? Could he then ask the actress to stand up so he could remove the cushion she sat on , pull the handle to unfold the mattress , take out the pillows and blankets from under the backrest  --  and all for the purpose of performing an act that thus far had not even been named ? Levanter imagined himself nonchalantly approaching the sofa , leaning against it , just inches from the actress , and saying , " Why do n't you get up for a moment . " She turns to him , an inquiring look on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No thank you . I 'm quite comfortable here . " Then what ? He knew he could no more say simply , " I want to turn this sofa into a bed ; I want to make love to you " than he could tell her what kind of love he wanted from her . The more he searched for the appropriate Russian words and phrases , the more apprehensive he became . The mother tongue had turned into an uninvited chaperone , guarding his passion from getting out of hand . Yet he almost laughed out loud when he remembered that the word for convertible sofa in his native language was " Amerykanka "  --  translation : " American woman . " They sat quietly , from time to time glancing at each other , the actress snuggled in the corner of the couch , Levanter stiff and pensive on his chair . The actress was barricaded by the stack of photographs which she went through for a second time . She gave the last one a long , attentive look . Then she got up . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , inhaling her perfume , escorted her to the door . They exchanged the banalities of a polite good-by . As she walked down the stairs , he caught a glimpse of her hips . In a minute , she was gone . He felt like a schoolboy who had pathetically failed his first blind date.  |p60It  was when he was fifteen . Excellence in many cultural and athletic activities of the Youth Movement over two years had earned him a gold medal , an award that entitled him to a full , state-paid summer vacation at a Youth Movement camp . Located deep in the country on the bank of a river and surrounded by dense forest , the camp gave teen-agers a respite from the cities so recently ravaged by war . As he was boarding the train , Levanter 's suitcase fell onto the tracks and sprang open . Seized by embarrassment and terrified that the train was about to depart , he hesitated about trying to retrieve any of his belongings . Unexpectedly , one of the boys from the YM contingent lowered himself underthe train and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its contentsto Levanter . The boy barely managed to crawl out and climb back into the carriage before the train jerked and started to move . During the five-hour journey , Levanter and Oscar , the boy who had rescued his things , became friends . Oscar was a year older than Levanter and about four inches taller . If Levanter could have magically changed his appearance , he would have wanted to look exactly like Oscar : sandy hair , pale blue eyes , chiseled features . He was pleased that he was assigned to the same twenty-bed bunkhouse as his new friend . The YM camp , one of the largest in the country , accommodated over two thousand boys , with several hundred teen-age girls at the adjacent girls ' camp . The two camps shared the river front and often held joint events . One day Levanter and Oscar strolled past a tall , good-looking girl with blond hair pulled back in a single braid . Oscar remarked that she could be an ideal blind date , and if he encountered her walking alone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breaking the eye was what he called rape , he explained . Noting Levanter 's surprise , he admitted that he had been raping girls and women for three orp61four years , and by now had raped several dozen . Twice within the past year he had been picked up by police as a rape suspect but was released both times because the victims could not identify him positively . He had worked out a fail-safe way to break the eye , he said , and credited himself with inventing a hold to keep the victim at his mercy : the twist , he dubbed it . Thanks to the twist , not one of his victims had ever managed to see his face  --  that was why he called them blind dates . Along with these bits of terminology , Oscar had developed a whole sex vocabulary . A female 's head was a melon , her mouth a lock , hands were grabbers , the back a sun deck , breasts points , nipples contacts , and her belly a plate ; her legs were sticks , the groin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrows . First he would grip her hair from behind , so she could n't turn around , and trip her . Then , with his fingers , he would squeeze and turn the contacts and pull on them ; when she seemed unable to withstand the pain anymore , he would release the contacts but almost simultaneously enter her cut . At this point , she would usually submit without further resistance . Oscar had also worked out a certain philosophy : sex was a spring that nature kept permanently wound , and man 's obligation to himself was to unwind it as often as possible . Rape was a mere short cut to the unwinding ; it was also a sport that required expertise . Since the sex act required physical arousal of the male , and not of the female , nature had arranged for males to break the eye of females . Levanter asked Oscar to show him some of his eye-breaking tricks when they were alone in their bunkhouse . Oscar told him to cross the room . Levanter got up from his bed and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair , immobilizing his head ; a knee pressed into his back . In an instant , he was tripped onto the floor , face down ; in another instant , Oscar wedged himself between Levanter 's legs . A flattened frog , unable to move , Levanterwas helpless . " That 's the twist , " Oscar announced with pride . Oscar showed Levanter a diary he had kept of his past blind dates . For each encounter , he had noted the victim 's characteris/tics , the place where he had first seen her , where he had attacked her , whether she was a virgin , and where he had finally left her . And he kept a list of prospective blind dates , two or three likely candidates , whose schedules and whereabouts he had already established . He was also an expert on the natural environment : he knew the best places to accost a female , where to drag her , where to play with her , and how to get away after he was finished with her . He talked about rape with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good haircut . Often , Oscar said , he could assess the nature of a blind date by the way she carried herself on the street  --  he could guess whether she was timid and fearful , hysterical and resistant , strong-willed or submissive , and he would restrain her accordingly . If he had to stifle her screams , he explained , he would hold her lock until she lost her breath ; if he needed to immobilize her , he would penetrate the narrows instead of the cut and keep her pinned down ; when he required a longer time for his arousal and climax , or if she seemed too powerful or too resistant , he would tie her grabbers behind her back , bind her sticks , and stuff a handkerchief in her lock . Oscar admitted that there was one disadvantage to his method : he took all his blind dates from behind . As he was unwilling to risk being identified , he had never kissed one on the lock and could enjoy their faces only when stalking them , only from afar . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would still be afraid to kiss her on the lock for fear of being bitten on the lip or cheek and , thus branded , being recognizable to the police . Furthermore , in one of his recurring dreams , he confessed , he was giving a blind date a deep kiss , his tongue flicking back and forth inside her lock , when she suddenly clamped her teeth down and , like an epileptic having a fit , bit off his tongue , spitting the spongy scrap straight into his face . Blood gushed from his mouth and he could see the severed tongue tumbling down his chest . Thanks to this dream , he said , he had perfected the twist . To notice a blind date , to follow her unseen , nurturing his thoughts of what he would do with her , teasing his desire as if itp63were a dog about to be unleashed , then , in one spontaneous moment , to break her eye  --  this was for Oscar the essence of his blind dating . And blind dating  --  along with other occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it started moving  --  was all that interested him in life . At coeducational events , Oscar would point out a girl he found attractive . The girl , responding to what she took for a sign of his interest , would smile at him and he would smile back at her as if he were simply too shy to approach her . In a low voice , he pondered the girl 's reaction when , in the woods or on a street , behind a bench in the park or in a niche in a basement , he would trap her and command her to obey him . He described in great detail what he would do to her when he had ripped her clothes off and subdued her again and again , until he was exhausted . At first Levanter had listened to Oscar with mixed fear and curiosity , eager to know more about his friend 's adventures . But after a while , when Oscar went into his erotic speculations , Levantergrew sexually aroused , always thinking of the blond girl with the long braid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , one of the counselors who knew Levanter from the city and was particularly fond of him warned him about Oscar . Oscar 's YM membership had been suspended twice for misconduct , the counselorsaid ; he had been in trouble with the law , and he was known to be emotionally unstable . Levanter listened attentively , agreed to be less dependent on his friend , but immediately put the whole conversationout of his mind , and went right back to Oscar and their imagined blind dating . Oscar told Levanter that he had found a short cut through the forest to the girls ' camp and that it was an ideal place for blind dating . The forest was dark , the foliage above would mute any screams , and the mosses underfoot offered nice soft padding . He could stalk his blind date even before twilight , safely break her eye , and return to camp unnoticed in time for supper . Once the two boys bicycled along the short cut . Oscar stopped midway and they dragged their bikes out of view and hid in thep64underbrush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional camper go by . When they saw a girl , Oscar started to outline how he would reach for her hair , shove her into the woods , and force her to kneel . He would tear off her clothes , then grasp her pillows , and for a moment hold her , all tense , with his groin pressed hard against her until she began to writhe and thrash under him , and then he would spread her apart even more and pump into her with all his force , one hand over her lock , smothering her scream , the other holding her sun deck as she bucked back and forth , in pain and fear . Levanter was captivated . What his friend envisaged was to him an adventure , a thrilling game of hide-and-seek . The girl would be hurt , but Levanter tended to agree with Oscar , considering the bruises and scratches of the forced entry as the only sources of her pain . He rationalized that a virgin making love for the first time , even willingly , had to suffer some pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reasoned , it approximated rape . He argued with himself that , in the manner of an ordinary virgin being deflowered , the blind date would not be visibly crippled or mutilatedand might even become aroused . The distance between talking about a rape and actually performingone still seemed enormous to Levanter . He argued with Oscar that , unlike a city , a vacation camp could not assure one of anonymity . But Oscar dismissed his caution as naive . Fear is the same everywhere , he said , and everyone is blinded with panic when jumped from behind , no matter where , no matter when . Oscar stopped taking Levanter to the path . Levanter began to suspect that Oscar was annoyed by his apprehension and did n't want him around anymore . One morning , browsing in the sports shop that serviced the two camps , Levanter saw the blond girl with the long braid . He was too shy to approach her , even to attempt to strike up a conversation ; all the chats he had rehearsed in his mind became useless the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter . He heard a salesman tell her to return at five o'clock to collect the table-tennis nets that she had brought in for repair . The girl left thep65shop . Levanter followed her discreetly until she entered the forest short cut . Suddenly , he knew what he was going to do . After lunch , Levanter feigned a headache and was sent to his bunk . He remained there , under the covers , eyes closed , until the last of the boys had come in to change for the afternoon swim . Then he slipped out through the rear exit and picked up a bike left there by a counselor who had gone to town and was not expected to return until the next day . Levanter pedaled around the camp and soon was in the forest . Halfway through the short cut , he veered into the bushes and stopped . He hid the bike near the place Oscar had evaluated as the best spot for a blind date and sat behind the large bush , waiting . He checked his watch : four-thirty . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set . It still brightened the highest trees , keeping the birds away , but below , where Levanter waited , twilight descended . A uniformed YM janitor pedaled his bike along the path . He puffed and panted , trying to ride over the roots that swelled out from little patches of sand or moss . Finally , he disappeared from sight . Levanter found himself almost hoping the girl would not show up . Then he saw her . She walked fast , with a firm stride , as if training for a parade . Her long single braid swayed from side to side . He felt neutral , neither aroused nor afraid . He expected his body to act when the time came but could not think about it now . The braid was all he concentrated on . The girl was a few feet away . She passed the mark he had fixed for striking . As he was about to sprint toward her , he remembered another of Oscar 's rules : once you start running toward your blind date , run as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller the chance that she will have time to hear your footsteps and turn around to see you . To the police , once you grip her she has been assaulted , so you might as well continue and make the best of it . He started to his feet , then lunged forward . In an instant he had the braid and , using all his strength , held the girl 's head fromp66moving . She screamed , but when he put his other arm around her neck and tightened it as a threat that he could choke her , her voice faded completely . His arm tilting her head up to the sky , his knee pushing into her thighs , Levanter steered her off the path and into the bushes . Only when he had her behind the thicket , safely away from the path , did he catch his breath . The girl was pleading with him to let her go . Terrified that she detected a weakness in him , Levanter panicked and shook her by the hair . She stopped begging and sobbed quietly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at her back , where her dress was soaked with perspiration . Slowly he removed his arm from under her chin while increasing the pull on the braid . The girl made no sound . Then , with his free hand he ripped her dress and , as she began to moan and whine , he pulled her panties down around her feet . Following Oscar 's lessons , he tripped her , and , as she stumbled , he kicked her pantiesaside and guided her body by the braid , lowering her to the ground . Completing the twist , he fell upon her . She was now immobilized , her face pushed into the leaves and moss , her breath coming in staccato gulps . With one hand , Levanter pulled down his pants and placed himself between her legs . When he felt his flesh against hers , he slid his hand beneath the torn dress , found her breast , and began pinching the nipple . He licked her neck , his tongue gathering the droplets of sweat that surfaced like sap on her skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as he maintained his grip on her there was no danger she would ever know who he was . He was safe . Dusk continued to fall . In the dense bushes of the hollow , he was as safe as the little lizards that had scurried away when he pushed the girl through the thicket . He began to think about her . He recalled how she had stood in the shop , smiling , talking , glancing around , unaware of what she meant to him . And he remembered seeing her once on the riverbank , with a tall , handsome boy , a YM swimming champion ; every time the boy had inclined his head toward her , her face had lit up with such admiration and joy that Levanter had been filled withp67envy and had to look away . If she were a thing , he thought , one day he could own her . He began to think about her body as he had thought of her all those times ; he could remember the filtered rays of sun upon her corn-silk hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under him . He was preparing to sink into her with all the force of nature 's spring unwinding . He was fully aroused . Gently , he kissed her neck . Listening to her sobs , he moved his hand down , stroking her , pushing aside the moss and leaves that stuck to her . Her body eased a bit , and when he detected that , in one smooth motion he planted his flesh in her , guiding it with his hand until it was firmly in place , deep and hard , breaking through a delicate inner barrier that seemed no thicker than a leaf . She screamed , and he thought that , without having spoken a single word to her , he had just become her first lover . The thought quickened his movement . She tensed and lay whimpering . He did not want to rush , reminding himself that as long as he was behind and inside her , pinning her down with his weight , she could not see him , and he could do as he wished for as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , his thought separated from his body ; and he stiffened , ready to scream , his hand pulling her hair harder , almost against his own will . Then , his entire body seemed to let go , suddenly free of the inner pull . He collapsed , but the physical release did not bring about the release of his need . He became conscious of time and glanced at his watch : only a few minutes had passed . The girl moaned under him . He became tender , kissing the soft skin on the nape of her neck , sniffing its fluffy hair , tasting the salty sweat , his fingers lightly stroking her temples . He rested . Then a wave of excitement came again . He felt more in commandthis time , less at the mercy of his flesh . She seemed to sense that her attacker was not through with her and began pleading with him to let her go . He pushed her face deeper into the earth , and when she gasped and coughed , he entered her again , more forcefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steadily breaking it . When , at one moment , she tensed and he slipped out , she started to thrash . He grew impatient and angry ; hep68spread her flat . She let out a high-pitched scream and strained to pull away from him . He remembered another of Oscar 's lessons ; he slowly moved his legs , first one , then the other , until they were over her shoulders and he was sitting upon her with all his weight . As his feet forced her face harder into the ground , he thrust into her once more , but not where he had entered her the first time ; her moans turned into a piercing shriek . There was something unnaturalabout the sound . He imagined an inner spring had snapped inside her , and even though he thought of withdrawing , he once more succumbed to his own need . His body grew taut and he pushed into her with all his might , no longer able to withdraw . He felt his neck tensing , his fingers involuntarily digging into her skin . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaned , her body splayed under him like a grotesque puppet with its limbs dangling ; all he wanted was to see her face . Her body alone could not tell him what he wanted to know . Only on her face would he be able to read what she felt . Both his body and his mind were empty . Slowly he lifted himself from her , reflecting that his blind date was not over yet . He kept her pinned down with one hand , and with the other used her torn dress to wipe the blood off his groin , thighs , and hands . He stuffed the panties into her mouth , then ripped strips of fabric from her dress and bound them loosely around her feet and hands so it would take her some time to get free . He remembered to tie one strip over her eyes so she could not see him as he left . He was finished now and ready to get away . It was almost dark and he was not afraid . He dressed slowly , as if to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the bike and rode back toward camp , ready to slip into the bushes if anyone approached from the opposite direction . He replaced the bike and quickly entered the bunkhouse through the back door . No one was there . He crawled into his bed and pretended to be asleep . The smell of her lingered on his hand . His memory randomly protracted or compressed images of her in the forest ; he was astonished that he could recall so much without having made any effort to remember . Soon the other boys returned . He opened his eyes and told themp69his headache was almost gone . He took a shower , but even when he was dry , the scent of her flesh persisted on his body . Oscar came in . Levanter was at first tempted to tell his friend about his blind date . But he was feeling possessive about the girl and did n't want to share the details of his encounter with her . Instead , Levanter complained about his headache and the lost afternoon . In the middle of the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the lights were turned on and , as Levanter and the other boys watched , two uniformed policemen , accompanied by the camp director and two camp counselors , marched in and took Oscar and all his belongings away with them . The lights were turned off , but Levanter could not sleep . Even before morning roll call , the whole camp seemed to have heard of Oscar 's arrest . As Levanter was known to be Oscar 's closest friend , he was besieged with questions . Levanter shrugged and said that he too was astonished by the arrest . After the routine morning ceremonies , the camp director , lookingquite angry , addressed the two thousand boys lined up before him . He announced in a stern voice that the previous afternoon a vicious sexual attack on a girl camper had been committed and that police authorities had already arrested the perpetrator . It was a boy who had confessed to similar crimes in the past : Oscar . Levanter felt overcome by a horror he had never experienced before . He realized for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl and Oscar . He stood paralyzed by panic . He knew only one way to end it . The director had finished and was ready to give the signal to dismiss the campers . Levanter stepped out of line . " Sir , " he called . He felt his knees begin to buckle under him and summoned all his strength to stand straight , before the whole camp . In the past , he had been called forward to receive praise . Now he was stepping forth to turn himself in . He felt numb again , as he had before he sprang upon his blind date . He could no more step back into line than he could undo the rape . He waited.  |p70The  director recognized him instantly . " There is Levanter , our gold medalist , " he announced , his voice turning cheerful . " What is it , my friend ? " Levanter 's mouth was dry . His tongue moved sluggishly as he started to speak . " I raped that girl , Oscar did n't , " he heard his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A frightful silence fell . Levanter heard the wind snap the flag around its pole . The director looked at him baffled . " We appreciate your motive for making this statement , Levanter , because we know Oscar has been your friend , " he said firmly . " But we know Oscar is the only culprit . " He was about to end the roll call . " As I 'm making this statement officially , sir , " Levanter interrupted , his voice now clear , " I insist that my admission be formally entered in the record of the investigation . " " Let it be in the record , then , " the director said indulgently . " Come to my office in an hour . " After roll call , the boys surrounded Levanter . " You could n't have raped her , " said one of Levanter 's bunkhousemates . " You were sick and slept the whole afternoon . I saw you ! " he exclaimed . " We all saw you in bed , " added another , and two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raping a girl , " said one boy , and others laughed . " There 's not much any of us can do for Oscar now , " one of them said with a snicker . Levanter did not know what to say . " What if you 're all wrong ? " he finally asked . " What if I did do it ? " " But I saw you sleeping " another boy yelled . " And I saw you going to the shower after you woke up , just before supper , " shouted another . At the director 's office , he was introduced to a young police lieutenant , who patted Levanter on the shoulder and directed him to a chair . " There 's no use , Levanter , no use at all in what you 're trying to do , " he said . " When the local police summoned us last night , we already had our suspicions . Then , early this morning , faced withp71the evidence , your friend Oscar admitted that he has raped many girls before , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one . " He paused and looked hard at Levanter . " Could it be , Levanter , that he asked you in advance to take the blame for it ? " Levanter did not respond . The lieutenant continued in an even voice . " What 's more , we found his diary , in which he describes , in his own handwriting , dozens of his past assaults . These rapes match the police files . What more can we ask for ? " The director handed the lieutenant a sheet with Levanter 's statement . The lieutenant glanced at it , then , to indicate that he refused to accept it , gently pushed it across the table to Levanter . " Oscar might have raped other girls , " said Levanter . " But I raped the one yesterday . I can identify the girl and the exact spot where I did it . " The lieutenant appraised him thoughtfully . " Of course you can , " he said . " Oscar might have pointed her out to you . He might even have showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the details of how I did it , " said Levanter insistently . " I can show you exactly what I did to make this girl  --  " " Of course you can , " the lieutenant cut him off softly . " But you do n't have to . You see  --  " He paused . " We know all this already . There 's no doubt that the poor girl who was raped yesterdaywas attacked by the same man who raped a dozen others in our town . In each case he used the same tricks  --  grabbing the victim 's hair from behind and wounding her in the same perverted way . " The lieutenant spoke in an even , controlled voice . Levanter leaned on his hand and breathed in the girl 's scent that still lingered under his nails . " But I can give you a precise recollection of what went on in the forest , " he argued . " Minute by minute . Where I stopped her , how I shoved her . What and how I touched . I can tell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . " The lieutenant gave him another thoughtful look . " Let 's leave this girl alone , Levanter . She 's suffered enough ; she 's still in the hospital and , as a friend of the man who raped her , you 're the last person in the world she would want to hear from . " He looked atp72the director . " They say she 's going to need surgery , you know , " the lieutenant said quietly . The director nodded . " I 'm sure Levanter realizes that his claim , however honorable his motives , is an attempt to obstruct justice , " he said . Without allowing Levanter to say anything further , he got up . The lieutenant and Levanter followed . The director took Levanter by the arm and gently led him to the door . He embraced him at the threshold . " You 're a good man , Levanter , a good YM medalist , too . But there 's a limit to friendship . I 'm glad you wo n't be seeing Oscar for a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case alone . " The following spring , Levanter attended his school 's annual citywide dance . Each time the band took a break , Levanter and his friends gathered in a knot . One time , a group of students from another high school joined them , and introductions started . When Levanter turned to one pleasant-looking girl and said his name , another girl , a tall blonde with short hair , who had been looking the other way , wheeled around , quickly , as if startled . Levanter looked at her . For a moment he had the feeling he had seen her before , but he could n't place her . As the others paired off to dance , the blond girl spoke to him . " So you are George Levanter ? " she said , looking at him curiously . " Sorry to disappoint you , " Levanter joked . " Yes , I am . " They started to walk away from the dance floor . As they moved toward the side door of the gymnasium , he could hear the tapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was told you were a friend of someone I met once , " she said . " Someone you met once ? " " Someone I met only once , " she corrected . " Who is it ? " They had left the gymnasium and began to walk more slowly in the corridor outside . It was empty , lit only by a few bare bulbs . " A boy . " She said it without feeling . " And you say he was my friend ? "  | " I said you were a friend of his , not the other way around . " Levanter was confused . " What 's his name ? " They reached the end of the corridor and stood next to the large window , looking out at the schoolyard . A solitary lamp lit the basketball backboard ; the net swung in the breeze . " Will you promise never to repeat what I 'm about to tell you ? " she asked . She turned around and leaned back against the window , facing Levanter . " I promise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The boy 's name was Oscar . He raped me last summer , " she said flatly . Levanter felt the blood rush to his face . In seconds he was covered with sweat . He stepped backward , uncertain of what to do or say . Now he recognized her . But the braid was gone . She was more shapely , more womanly . He wanted to see her eyes , but they were obscured in the shadows . " The police told me Oscar had a friend named Levanter , who claimed to have done it , " she said . " I 've never understood why you would claim that . " Levanter did not say anything . She kept on . " Of course , since several boys in the dormitory saw you asleep that afternoon , you knew all along nobody would believe you . You had nothing to lose . " She paused , offering Levanter time to speak . He said nothing . " Still , why would anyone want to pose as a rapist ? " She tried again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now whether it was Oscar or somebody else who hurt you then ? " he asked . She shrugged . " I 've never doubted it was Oscar . He raped girls before , you know . No one saw his face , true , but he did the same things to them as he did to me . You were his friend , he probably told you . " Levanter detected some anger in her voice . " Do you really want to talk about it ? " he asked . " Not about it . About him . "  | " All right , " said Levanter . " I met Oscar by chance on my way to camp . Once we became friends , he told me he had raped girls before we 'd met . But I never saw him doing it , and I was never sure he was telling the truth . " Levanter felt the heat emanating from her body . " Ironically , I remember seeing you at camp , but not Oscar , " she said . " Do you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more at ease now . " Yes , I saw you two or three times . The last time was at the sports shop  --  actually , that was the day it happened , my last day at camp . " She sounded plaintive . " You were picking up sunglasses or postcards or something . I stared at you : you looked lost . " " And I saw you and stared at you many times , " said Levanter . " I recall everything about you . You see , I followed you every chance I got . " " Pity you were n't following me that day . You might have preventedhim from  --  " She stopped . Levanter no longer felt intimidated . He moved closer to her . As he spoke , he looked out at the empty yard . " In my thoughts I called you Nameless . " " That 's kind of romantic , " she said , " but now you can call me by my real name  --  " " I know your name , " Levanter interrupted her quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I inquired about you the first time I saw you at camp . But you 'll always be Nameless to me . " He had straightened up , away from her , and stood staring at his feet . " Why did n't you ever talk to me ? " she said softly . " Other boys did . " Levanter did not look up . " I know , " he said . " But I was too frightened . I saw you with a tall , good-looking guy , that swimming champ . You laughed at everything he said , and he looked at you as if he owned you . I was jealous . I would have given anything to be as close to you as he was . " When he raised his head , he could just make out that she was smiling.  | " I remember him , " she said . " He was funny . But I only talked to him a few times . " " I watched you every time the two camps were together , " Levantersaid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it to you . I know that 's a terrible thought , but it 's the truth . " She listened in silence . " You see , Nameless , I was in love with you . Maybe I still am . " He did not move . He felt his pulse beating in his temples . She did what he could not bring himself to do . She moved close enough for their faces to touch , but Levanter was reluctant to put his hands on her . They could see each other 's eyes . A cold shiver ran through him . She reached up and folded her hands behind his neck . Tentatively , he ran one hand lightly over her back , sliding it down her silk blouse , feeling the brassiere , then the panties under her tight skirt . The hand lingered there for a moment , then he brought it up to rest gently at the back of her neck . With his other hand , he raised her chin until her eyes caught the dim light from outside . He looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face as he had memorized the rest of her . Slowly , Levanter pulled back . " Are you afraid of hurting me ? " She hesitated . " Because of what he did to me ? " " I am afraid of losing you , Nameless . Of losing you again , " said Levanter . " Do n't be afraid , " she whispered . " You wo n't lose me unless you want to . " He saw Nameless every day , right after school . He waited impatiently , afraid that she would not show up , until he saw her jump off the streetcar as it slowed at the corner . They went to the public library and sat together at one of the large tables doing their homework . Each evening , as they stood across the street from her home , about to part , Levanter already began to fear , even while he was still with her , that she might notp76want to see him again . Perhaps during the night , pondering the events of the day , she would come across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to bind her to him . Under various pretexts he avoided introducing her to his parents , and postponed meeting hers . She had told him he was her first boyfriend ; he argued that meeting him might make her parents unnecessarily apprehensive about their only child . Levanter had not kissed her and avoided every opportunity to make love with her . He remained genuinely shy , fearful that he would do something that would make her leave him . Summer came . On the first hot weekend the two of them rode their bicycles out of town . Nameless said she was tired , and they stopped at a lake in a nearby forest and lay down on the still , grassy shore . " It 's so peaceful here , " she said once she had caught her breath . " So private , so safe . " Levanter looked into her face . He marveled at the perfect symmetryof her features . She studied him , her eyes moving from his lips to his eyes , then back to his lips . She reached toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She rolled over and rested her head on his thigh . He felt reassuredand ran his fingers lightly over her back . He looked down and saw the nape of her neck . It was white and frail , barely covered with delicate , thin fuzz . Tenderly , he framed her head between his hands , kissing the spot and licking the little drops of perspiration . Involuntarily , in their own remembrance of the past , his fingers started to stroke her temples . Nameless sprang up with such force that he was thrown backward . " What happened ? " Levanter scrambled to his feet , confused . Her face , so wholesome and calm just seconds before , was now disfigured with rage . " It was you . Now I know it . It was you ! " she screamed , covering her face with her hands.  |p77Levanter  turned away from her . Behind him , he heard her climbing onto her bicycle . When he dared to look around , Namelesswas far away , pedaling as fast as she could . He found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could own her . Levanter never telephoned the Russian actress again . She presented a dilemma that he could not solve . For years , he ceased to be aware that the language buried under his American experience was still strong enough to trigger an unexpected emotion . The language itself kept surfacing at the most unlikely moments . One morning , as he was walking to a meeting at a New York hotel , Levanter passed an old woman and overheard her mumbling to herself in Russian as she plodded slowly down the street . He turned to get a better look at her . Peering through her old-fashioned bifocals , she noticed his curiousstare . " Look at this stupid one ! " she said out loud . " Staring , as if he 'd never seen an old woman before ! " Addressing her politely in Russian , Levanter said , " Forgive me , Madame , I did not mean to stare at you . I merely heard you speaking Russian . This is America . People do n't understand you . " " How do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retorted angrily , then tottered away , murmuring to herself , " Another smart one , ready to speak for everybody . " Levanter was invited to teach a course in investment and had to rent a place to live in Princeton . " We 've found a marvelous house for you , " the real estate agent announced cheerfully . " Right next to Khrushchev 's daughter ! " " Khrushchev 's daughter ? " Levanter asked . " Who ? " He thought for an instant . " You must mean Stalin 's daughter . "  | " Khrushchev 's daughter , Stalin 's daughter , what 's the difference ? " The man shrugged . Levanter was overwhelmed by the extraordinary quirk of fate . He knew that Svetlana Alliluyeva had come to America and that she lived in Princeton . But he had never imagined how it would feel to be near her . Apprehensive , he agreed to rent the house . Weeks later , when some American friends actually invited Levanterto meet Svetlana Alliluyeva , he still found it difficult to accept the knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surreptitiously , silently repeating to himself that this woman was indeed Stalin 's daughter . The thought of her proximity to Stalin paralyzed him . Even though he knew he was responding irrationally , he could not bring himself to speak Russian . From the start , Levanter addressed her in English , apologizing for being out of practice with the language of his parents . In the months that followed , they met several times . Their conversationranged from events in recent European history and the Soviet Union 's role in shaping the world today to a letter from one of the many readers of her books . But the two of them never exchanged a word in Russian . Her name alone , even over the telephone , was enough to call up visions of his Moscow past , and for him she became a direct link to the awesome power that Joseph Stalin had wielded . Levanter had to remind himself again and again that he was a lecturer in Princeton now , not a student in Moscow , and that he was talking with a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of Stalin . Later , in Paris , Levanter told Romarkin about his acquaintanceshipwith Svetlana Alliluyeva , and his friend was overwhelmed . " Can you imagine ? " he thundered at Levanter . " Can you imaginemeeting her in Moscow when her father was still alive ? Suppose in the late forties you had come to one of those university social events . You noticed an average-looking woman . And when you asked , Who is that woman ? ' you were told , That is Svetlana , the daughter of Joseph Stalin ! ' Can you imagine how great your astonishment would have been then ? "  |p79Levanter  showed him a few photographs of Svetlana Alliluyeva . Picking up the snapshots reverently , as if he were handling fragile and irreplaceable heirlooms , Romarkin carefully spread them out on the cafe table and studied each one . " It ca n't be , " he whispered . " The daughter of Stalin an American . It ca n't be . " He shook his head . " If within a quarter of a century you or I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and meet his daughter as an ordinary next-door neighbor , well , I guess that means anything can happen . " Levanter could no more part with his language than he could forget about his cultural heritage , as he was often reminded . One of his European professors , who had just immigrated and knew very little English , asked him to dinner at his apartment . When Levanter arrived , he found the professor in the kitchen . The air was filled with the pungent scent of spices , herbs , and freshly cooked meat . The professor , impressed with the variety of Americanfoodstuffs , was surrounded by fresh vegetables and an assortment of open jars and bottles . He told Levanter he was preparing a special Ruthenian beef goulash . As they chatted in Russian , Levanter noticed several empty cans , each with a picture of a dog 's head on the label . He edged over to the counter and looked more closely . The cans , clearly marked DOG FOOD , seemed to have just been opened . " Where is the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The professor was stirring the goulash , inhaling the aroma . " Do n't you have a dog here ? " " Heaven forbid ! " exclaimed the professor . " Animals are a nuisance . What gave you that idea ? " " Americans love dogs . I thought you had gotten yourself one . " " I will never be that much an American ! "  |p80Nonchalantly  , Levanter looked around the kitchen . " What meatdo you use for such a succulent goulash ? " he asked guardedly . His host beamed . " Beef , my friend , only canned beef , " he said , gesturing with his chin at the cans . " Canned beef ? Fascinating ! But why canned ? " asked Levanter . " Better quality . Tastier and tenderer . " " Why this particular brand ? " asked Levanter , pointing to the empty cans . " I was in the supermarket , and when I saw the picture of the smiling dog , just like in the old country , I knew it was the choicest American canned beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you remember our Smiling Dog ' brand beef ? You 've been away too long . " As they sat down to eat , the professor breathed in the scent of the goulash , an expression of bliss on his face . During the meal , he praised the high quality and tenderness of American meat , assuring Levanter that it was superior even to the " Smiling Dog " beef he remembered so fondly . Levanter said he was not hungry that evening and accepted only one small helping . Another European immigrant , a respected poet , invited Levanter to a reception at his home following the wedding of his son , a graduate student at Yale . The bride , a Yale coed , was from an old banking family , and the guest list of two hundred was composed predominantly of " natives , " as the poet called them  --  the New England relatives and friends of the bride 's family . During the reception many of the guests admired an antique , cast-iron , muzzle-loading mortar cannon , about the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the living room . At one point , the poet urged the guests to gather more closely around the cannon and , in a voice heavy with emotion that exaggerated his accent , explained that the cannon had been built for his ancestors in the second half of the seventeenth century , for only one purpose : to be fired in celebration of every wedding in the family . The last time it had been used was when the poet himself was married , just before the start of World War II , and the cannon was the sole familyp81heirloom that had been salvaged after the war . He and his wife had recently arranged to have it shipped to them from Europe . And now , he said , to celebrate the marriage of his son the old cannon was to be fired again , for the first time on American soil . As the curious guests formed a circle around the cannon , the poet assured them that he had loaded it with a blank charge . He then grouped his wife , the bride and groom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wedding photographer readied his camera . A single spotlight shone on the cannon 's shiny muzzle , angled upward , over the guests ' heads ! The band played the national anthem , then the anthem of the poet 's homeland . The poet and his wife embraced , weeping . Many of the guests were moved by the pomp and the outburst of feelings , but most fidgeted , waiting for the finale , eager to get back to partying . The band stopped . With a shaking hand , the poet lit the long wooden match . He stretched his other arm around the newlyweds . Everyone was silent as the flame touched the fuse . There was a sudden flash . A powerful blast shook the room , the cannon jumped , and dense smoke billowed from its barrel . From the other side of the room , a woman shrieked , " My God , I 'm hit ! " Everyone turned calmly in the direction of the voice , apparently assuming that it was all part of the Slavic ritual . Near the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was covered with blood and her gown was ripped open , revealingstrips of skin hanging from her thighs . The guests , now in an uproar , gathered around her . She fainted . Leaning over the victim , Levanter realized that her wounds must be superficial , as they were caused only by the wads of cotton and shredded denim that the poet had used as a blank charge . But the poet panicked at the sight of the blood . He rushed to the phone to call for an ambulance . Levanter followed , explaining to him that , as a firearm was involved , he had to call the police . His fingers trembling , the poet dialed the police emergency number . The police operator answered quickly and asked for his name and address . So nervous that he mispronounced the words , the poet finallyp82managed to spell it all out in a quavering voice . Then the operator asked him what had happened . He stammered . " A woman shot . " Levanter heard the operator ask , " Shot by whom ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barely audible . " By what ? " the operator asked . " A cannon , " repeated the poet . " Please spell that , " said the operator , evidently uncertain that he had understood . " C-a-n-n-o-n . " " Cannon ? " the operator repeated . " A cannon , " said the poet . " How many others injured or killed ? " asked the operator matter-of-factly . " One woman wounded . " The poet moaned . " Property damage ? " " None . " He sighed . " What kind of cannon ? " " One of a kind . An antique . " " Is this a museum ? " asked the police operator . " A private home . " " A cannon in a private home ? " " Yes . A family cannon , " the poet whimpered . " Who fired the cannon ? " asked the operator . " I fired it , " said the poet , lowering his voice . " Your profession ? " " Poet . " " Poet ? But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ambulance is on the way , " announced the operator.  |p83Only  when he was with Romarkin did Levanter feel that the languageand heritage of his past were not out of place in his new life . Their reminiscences seemed to justify the break both of them had had to make with the very past that held them together . Whenever Levanter was in Paris , the two old friends spent countless hours talking . One evening when the cafe they were in was about to close , Levanter and Romarkin went next door to a small nightclub , where business was just beginning . Only a few tables were occupied , and a handful of solitary drinkers lounged at the bar . The waiters hurried around officiously , checking and adjusting the cloths and settings . A couple of prostitutes strolled back and forth between the cloakroom and the tiny lobby , keeping an eye on the entrance . Four musicians , presumably unwilling to start playing for so few customers , clustered around the piano , listlessly tuning their instruments , while the maitre d ' fiddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he and Romarkin were led to the remotest corner of the room , diagonally across from the bar . As soon as the waiter brought the champagne that was the price of admission , Levanter and Romarkin settled back comfortably . " Tell me , Lev , " said Romarkin , " have you found that people are good in the West ? Are they better than where you and I came from ? " The club was beginning to fill up ; a boisterous party took the five front tables . The band started to play , and two couples got up to dance . " I have found people to be good everywhere , " Levanter answered . " They turn bad only when they fall for little bits of power tossed to them by the state or by a political party , by a union or a company , or a wealthy mate . They forget that their power is nothing more than a temporary camouflage of mortality . " One of the prostitutes , who had been eyeing Levanter and Romarkin from the moment they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , tucking in her blouse to accentuate her breasts , and smiled at Romarkin . He smiled back , and the waiter immediately brought her a glassp84and filled it with their champagne . The woman raised her glass to both men and quickly drained it . Levanter ignored her and leaned toward Romarkin to continue their conversation in Russian . The woman listened for a few minutes , then interrupted them . " You speak a beautiful language . What is it ? " she asked in French . " It 's Eskimo , " Levanter replied . He turned back to Romarkin , hoping she understood that her services were of no interest to them . She laughed . " Eskimo ? Come on , do n't be silly . What are you ? " Levanter made himself look angry . " I resent your laughter and attitude , Mademoiselle , " he said . " We are Eskimo , and we are proud of it . " The woman continued to giggle . " But , Monsieur , Eskimos look like this , " she said , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like frozen Chinese ! But you  --  " She stopped , as if to search her memory . " You two could be Italian or perhaps Greek . But not Eskimo . " " Mademoiselle , " Levanter said harshly , " we Eskimos are a proud race , and we are no more frozen Chinese ' than the French are marinated Italians ' or the Swedes mummified Germans . ' " In a final attempt to send her away without insulting her , Levanter spoke to her in a confidential tone . " You see , my friend here and I are in Paris to secure your government 's aid in our revolutionary struggle to free ourselves from American and Canadian colonialism . We have just met with your Minister of Foreign Affairs . " She was no longer laughing . " So now , Mademoiselle , we must go back to discussing our business undisturbed . " The woman flushed . " Please forgive me , Monsieur , " she pleaded . " I 'm ignorant about Eskimos because I do n't have much education . But I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't afford to be prejudiced . " She stood up and , without even straightening her skirt , quickly slipped away . A little while later , a resounding drum roll interrupted themp85again . The proprietor of the club hurried onto the stage . He had opened his doors at the end of World War II , he announced , and since then his club had welcomed many distinguished and exotic guests . But tonight was truly special . For the first time ever , he said , he had the privilege of welcoming two real Eskimos , **28;3991;TOOLONG of their esteemed nation . He spread his arms and solemnly bowed toward Levanter and Romarkin . The spotlight was turned from the stage onto their table . Everyone  --  the loners at the bar , the prostitutes and the waiters , the handholdingcouples at the tables  --  turned to see the two Eskimos and started to applaud fervently . The band struck up the " Marseil-laise . " Levanter hunched down in his chair , his head lowered . Romarkin , however , seemed to enjoy the sudden attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . The proprietor called for silence and , all smiles , addressed Romarkin . " One of our charming hostesses had the pleasure to hear you speak your beautiful Eskimo language , " he said . " For the rest of us who have not had the privilege , may I prevail upon you to say something to us in Eskimo  --  a poem , a phrase , a word , anything ? " The guests began to applaud again . Romarkin bowed to the audience . Levanter suddenly felt he was back in that auditorium in Moscow . He tugged on Romarkin 's jacket , trying to force his friend to sit down . He was too late . As though about to deliver a prepared speech from a dais , Romarkin puffed up his chest , then , in a loud , clear voice he began to swear in Russian . It was the juiciest vocabulary of obscenities Levanter had heard since his Barbatov army days . Romarkin finished with a theatrical flourish that drew enthusiastic applause from his listeners . But not from all of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Romarkin started his harangue , they had straightened as if prodded by red-hot pokers . When he finished , they angrily smashed their glasses on the floor and began to yell at Romarkin in Russian . They could tell by his obscene Soviet lingo , they shouted , that he was one ofp86Stalin 's bully boys . But this was France , they screamed , storming toward Romarkin through the clutter of tables , and he had no right to assault them with his filthy tongue just because they were old Russian emigres and he was , no doubt , a Soviet agent posing as a tourist . Incensed , raging and ranting , they pushed chairs and people aside in their mad scramble to reach him . The proprietor seemed unable to move . The waiters stood by helplessly , perplexed to see other Eskimos in their club and baffled that one Eskimo 's remarks should have offended his countrymen . Levanter and Romarkin barricaded themselves behind two tables , hurling glasses and bottles at their attackers and defending themselves with chairs . Soon the police arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not arrested he would immediately pay for the damaged property . Pleading with the police to release Levanter and his friend , the proprietor explainedthat Eskimos , like the French , were often known to clash over their political views . The day after his friend 's nightclub speech , Levanter went to see Jacques Monod , the French biologist and philosopher , whom he had first met when Monod was on a research trip in the United States . Levanter recounted the story of Romarkin , beginning in Moscow . " Even now , in France , " Monod said , " your friend Romarkin does n't dare to admit that blind chance and nothing else is responsiblefor each random event of his life . Instead , he is searching for a religion that , like Marxism , will assure him that man 's destiny is spelled out in the central plot of life . Meanwhile , believing in the existence of an orderly , predetermined life scheme , Romarkin bypassesthe drama of each unique instance of his own existence . Yet , to accept a notion of destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm reading , or pulp novels , all of which pretend that one 's future is already set and needs only to be lived out . As Monod reached for a cup of tea , Levanter noticed a slight tremor in his hand . " Are you not well ? " asked Levanter.  | " I have n't been for some time , " said Monod . He managed to restrain the trembling long enough to pick up the teacup . " What is it ? " Levanter asked . Monod named the condition . " It was diagnosed at the onset , a few months ago , " he said , sipping his tea . Levanter was stunned . Monod , who had contributed so much to the world 's knowledge of how the living cell manufactures the substance of life , was being deprived of this very substance ; he had a disease for which there was no known treatment . He was only sixty-six years old . He looked healthy and was continuing to conduct his research , attend scientific conferences , and on weekends sail his boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Levanter found it inconceivable that Jacques Monod would soon die . Levanter struggled to remain calm . " Is anything being done ? " " Increasingly frequent blood transfusions . " Monod dismissed the subject . He mentioned that he would be leaving for Cannes and suggested that Levanter go there too so they could spend some time together . " Wo n't you find the trip rather tiring just for the weekend ? " Levanter asked . " I 'm not going just for the weekend , " Monod replied . " But the transfusions ? Can they be done there ? " asked Levanter . Monod said nothing . Levanter felt his throat constrict . " Why wo n't you remain in Paris ? All the life-support equipment is here . " Monod looked at him steadfastly . " To be hooked up to life through a machine ? " he asked abruptly . " The flame is n't worth the candle . " At any given time in history , Levanter 's father once claimed , civilizationis the result of sheer chance plus a thousand or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom know or have heard of each other . If you were one of them and wished to become acquainted with any other , you needed no more than two or three consecutive introductions . Levanter had discovered that , regardless of the field in which they excelled , all these men and women were , at least at some time in their lives , small investors , people who risked their personal energy and means to achieve certain unpredictable ends . One day , after a meeting at a large New York publishing house , Levanter stopped by unannounced to see a friend who was an editor there . She was going over a set of galley proofs with an imposing , gray-haired man , whom she introduced to Levanter . It was Charles Lindbergh , the aviator . To Levanter , Lindbergh was heroic but tragic : a man who achieved international fame , only to become , as a result of the media 's obsession with a crime against his family , one of the world 's most hounded public figures . Levanter apologized for interrupting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're almost finished . " Levanter and Lindbergh left at the same time . It was a clear fall day , and Lindbergh proposed they walk for a few blocks . As he steered Levanter up Fifth Avenue , he affected a slight stoop and tugged the brim of his hat down over his face . Levanter surmised that this public posture had become second nature to Lindbergh after years of trying to avoid recognition . " I know you flew over Eastern Europe before the war , " Levanter said . " A few years later , during the war , when I was six , I was separated from my family and wandered alone through the same villages you saw from your plane . " Lindbergh recalled his flight very well . He was on his way to visit the Soviet Union , flying his plane over the Ruthenian flatlands , the narrow rivers , lakes , and marshes that seemed never to end . He remembered the small villages and how from above they had appearedlike islands in the midst of swamps , the poor peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haystacks scattered about.  |p89Levanter  said that when the flight of The Spirit of St. Louis bridged the two continents , Levanter 's family had considered Lindbergh one of this century 's greatest heroes . But later , when Lindbergh received the Order of the German Eagle from Goering , its citation signed by Adolf Hitler , Lindbergh had dealt a frightful blow to their faith in human wisdom . Later , Levanter 's parents were distressed and baffled by Lindbergh 's participation in the America First movement , which was dedicated to keeping the United States out of the war . " When the war was over , " Levanter said , " my parents felt that we had survived because America finally entered and helped to win the war . And they felt that the rest of our family  --  sixty of them  --  had died because America First was a great influence in keeping America out of the war for so long . " They walked for a while without speaking . Then , almost as an afterthought , Lindbergh said that when he went to Germany and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good-will missions , just as his flight had been . He had sensed , he explained , that the Germans , who were themselves obsessed with ethnic origins , were relieved that Lindbergh bore them no ill will because the convicted kidnapper of his baby was of German origin . The Soviets , on the other hand , he said , invited him to inspect their aviation industry in the hope that he would praise it . When he did not , their propaganda soon labeled him a fascist . At the entrance to Central Park , a short woman in a mink jacket approached them , displaying lipstick-smeared teeth behind a gushingsmile . Lindbergh cringed and began to back away , but it was Levanter the woman was after . " I know you . I 've seen you on TV ! " she exclaimed in a highpitched voice . Levanter , who only occasionally appeared on television on behalf of Investors International , turned away . He took Lindbergh 's arm and started to walk on , but the woman dogged their steps . " Have n't I seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be confusing me with someone else , " said Levanter emphatically . Disappointed , she walked away . About a year later , Levanter was traveling in Switzerland and visited Lindbergh at his chalet there . Lindbergh invited him and his friends for a meal at a nearby inn . During dinner , Levanter suddenly realized that he had forgotten his attache case under a chair in the lobby of his hotel . In the case were not only his passport , credit cards , and money but also the only copy of the unpublished results of a pilot study that he had spent the past months compiling . He was afraid that if he called the hotel , the person sent to look for it might steal the case , simply claiming that it had n't been there . Yet the longer he waited , the greater was the likelihood that he would lose it . Nervous and uncertain about what to do , he stopped eating and fidgeted in his chair . Lindbergh leaned toward him and asked quietly , " What 's wrong ? " Levanter told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the manuscript in it . " Come , I 'll drive you to the hotel right now , " Lindbergh said . " But your dinner  --  " " I do n't need to finish . Let 's go . " As they drove , Lindbergh praised his small automobile as a marvel of German engineering . With only simple reconditioning of the engine , he said , his car had gone well over a hundred thousand miles . Levanter said he had been surprised to find so many expressions of positive interest in the Germany of the Third Reich in Lindbergh'sbook . Lindbergh explained that , compared to other countries he had visited before the war , Germany seemed to him to strive for a more efficiently organized means of production and had achieved admirable technological progress in aeronautics . He thought of the German state as an airplane and of its racial hatred , persecution , and aggression in the early thirties , as a temporary flight aberration caused by the pilot 's misreading of the plane'sp91control panel . Later , he realized he was wrong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from life . Mass atrocities , he said , like acts of individual heroism , often appear unthinkable before they occur . " And inevitable only after , " said Levanter . " What is your manuscript about ? " Lindbergh asked . " A study of individuals , " Levanter explained , " who through chance accidents have been propelled into national prominence and become important investors . " From the black shroud of sky , a snowstorm was spreading a white mantle over the earth . Lindbergh 's small car plowed slowly against the icy wind . He drove with steady hands , looking unwaveringlyahead . The car , engulfed in a blanket of moving snow , was like an airplane lost to everyone but its pilot , steadily pushing through the clouds , ice , and wind . They found the attache case , untouched , under the chair in the hotel lobby . They started back . The storm had passed , and the night was cold , the sky clear . Unexpectedly , Lindbergh stopped the car and turned off the engine . He got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of a jet plane , its drone growing more and more persistent as it moved closer . Lindbergh listened . When the plane 's flickering lights came clearly into sight , he pointed toward it . " Another 747 , right above us ! " he exclaimed . " One of the safest planes ever built ! " He looked up at the sky , listening to the sound of the jet engines reverberating in the air long after the plane disappeared into the darkness.  |p92It  was Levanter 's fifteenth Christmas in his new country . He hailed a cab . The driver , an older man , was voluble and friendly and they struck up a conversation . The man mentionedthat he had come to the United States from Eastern Europe after World War II . He named the town he was from . " That 's the very town where some of my relatives once lived , " Levanter said . The driver was clearly delighted . " Can you remember their address ? " he asked . Levanter named the street . " Small world ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned a grocery right in the neighborhood . It was a tiny street , with only three private houses . I delivered groceries to all of them . " " Then you knew number nine ? " asked Levanter . They were stopped at a traffic light . The driver turned around . " I sure did . Nine  --  the last house on the left . It was like a villa . A couple lived there , an old professor and his young wife , a pianist . They had a boy who was sick in the head . " He glanced at Levanter in the rearview mirror . " Were those your relatives ? " " Yes , " said Levanter . " Why do you say their boy was crazy ? " The driver pondered for a while . " I saw him myself . Hep93could n't speak . Never smiled or laughed . Just kept staring at you . Their own maid was afraid of him . She told me he would sneak out alone at night and stay away until morning , then sleep during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he drove on . " After the war a lot of children could n't speak , " said Levanter , " or smile or laugh or play in the daylight . " The driver shook his head . " This one was not like other kids , " he said . " I saw him . He was crazy . No doubt about it . " " As I remember him , " Levanter said , " the kid was quite nor-mal . " For a few moments the driver was silent , concentrating on the traffic , and Levanter thought he had dropped the subject . " Believe me , he was crazy , " said the driver as he pulled up at Levanter 's destination . " But that 's almost thirty years ago . You could n't have been more than a kid yourself , " he continued , taking another look at Levanter . " Perhaps I was too young to know this kid when you knew him , " said Levanter as he paid the fare . " But when we got older , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you or I. " " What do you mean ? " asked the driver . " That story 's for another ride , " said Levanter , leaving the cab . Levanter often reflected that his European upbringing was probablyresponsible for his tendency to pay far more attention to forms , questionnaires , letterheads , and rubber stamps than most nativebornAmericans . And he never sent an envelope without extra touches  --  self-adhesive mail stickers : FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY , RUSH , HANDLE WITH CARE , UNCLASSIFIED , SPECIAL ATTENTION  --  which he knew would attract attention and distinguish his letters from all other mail . An American business friend told him that any time one of Levanter 's envelopes arrived , his secretary was certain that the letter should not wait a minute longer and delivered it to her boss immediately , even if it meant dispatching it to his home by messenger . One day Levanter ran into one of his current correspondents , a friend who had spent the summer at his family 's home in the South.  |p94He  seemed a bit uneasy when he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I keep marveling at the care you give your mail , " he said after a moment . " Your letters really create a great stir . " Levanter looked at him quizzically . His friend went on . " All those colorful labels stuck on each envelope , " he said . " Even the mailman was intimidated . A couple of times he made separate trips to bring your letters , as if they were special delivery , even though all the stickers said was EXPEDITE orVERY URGENT Or CONFIDENTIAL . " Levanter felt like a prankster praised for playing a practical joke on a superior . " But some of your letters  --  I mean stickers  --  caused a major event in my family , " the man murmured . " An event ? " " That 's all I can call it . You see , one of my sisters has been an epileptic since childhood , " he said . " She 's in her forties now . Because of her illness , she never married and never worked away from the house . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . " Levanter squirmed . " She 's the one who collects the mail every day , " the friend went on . " A few months ago , she picked up your letter with a stickerproclaiming EPILEPSY  --  UNDERSTANDING IS HALF THE TREATMENT . She disregarded it at first , she said , but your next letter arrived with another slogan : HELP EPILEPTICS LIVE AND WORK IN DIGNITY . " Embarrassed , Levanter listened in silence . " Where do you get such stickers and stamps ? " his friend asked . " I got those from a foundation that I occasionally contribute to , " said Levanter lamely . " I see , " the man said . " In any case , by then my sister was convinced that I had put you up to sticking all those messages on your mail to prod her into getting a job . When a letter arrived with EMPLOY EPILEPTICS , she ran away from home , leaving a note that she had taken the hint and did not want to be a burden to thep95family anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . We found her in pretty bad shape , but she 's back home now. , , " It never occurred to me  --  " Levanter stammered . The other man shook his head . " It had never occurred to us either that she was so sensitive about her condition . No film or TV play about epileptics had ever upset her ; she never took them personally . Yet she really took off over that EMPLOY EPILEPTICS sticker . Amazing what the printed word can do ! " Like many other Europeans living in America , Levanter was awed by the effect the size of the country and its large population could have on one 's sense of freedom and enterprise . An acquaintance of his , an elderly man from Belgrade who had settled in Minneapolis , was full of stories about emigre investors . " For instance , take this fellow from Galicia , " he said to Levanter one day . " Came to this country a poor immigrant . No English , no profession to speak of , no relatives . Works nights sweeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day , just for fun , he places an ad in two newspapers , one on the West Coast and one in the East : TICKLE HER FANCY  --  THREE ORIGINAL TICKLERS FOR A DOLLAR ONLY . He lists a post-office box . If he gets any answers , he figures he 'll send every customer three ordinary goose feathers for their buck . After all , where he comes from men have other things to worry about than tickling the fancy of their women . " In a few days , the post office calls him to say he has received several thousand letters . He picks up his mail and starts opening the letters . Out pour orders from all over the country . Some with one dollar , some with several dollars . Before he knows it , he is investing in the mail-order business . He buys thousands of goose feathers , envelopes , and postal stamps , hires three sweet young things to help him fill the orders . He places more newspaper ads in papers throughout the nation , hires more employees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . But this is a large country , and a lot of people are willing to part with ap96mere dollar to tickle the fancy , or whatever else is ticklish , of their beloved . The orders keep coming . Today that guy is a millionaire . Over the mantelpiece in his Malibu Beach house hangs a plaque  --  a solid-gold relief of three goose feathers ! " After a few glasses of wine , the man admitted to Levanter that he had been forced to leave Yugoslavia when the whole capital seemed to know of his eccentric sexual proclivity . " How many people like me are there in the world ? " he asked . Levanter shrugged . The man answered himself . " A fraction of a fraction of one percent , " he said . " In a small country like Yugoslavia , that 's no more than a dozen people at most . They hide like animals , even from each other . But in America , a country of two hundred twenty million , " he continued , " a fraction of a fraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people with my preference , like people with various political views , are free to advertise , to communicate with each other , and even to congregate in public places . When I learned about it , I felt like a left-handed person discovering a whole town of left-handers . " He reached into his desk drawer and brought out a thick book . " Our most recent directory , " he said , handing it to Levanter . " It lists thousands of people who like the same thing I like : names and professions , addresses , telephone numbers , even photographs of some of them . In fact , it seems that in America there are more men and women with my taste than there are inhabitants in the whole city of Belgrade . Imagine that ! There I was a freak . Here I am one of the multitude . Nothing to be ashamed of anymore . " A few years after Levanter 's arrival in America , a New York-based booking agent for conventions mentioned that he had just arranged a three-day meeting of the newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People of America , it was anp97organization made up of unusually short men and women , both midgets and dwarfs . Small Americans , the agent said , tried to avoid convening in big cities . In subways and buses , their faces were pushed into other people 's thighs , bellies , and bottoms . Most public telephones were hung too high for them to reach . In general , dwarfs or midgets in trouble were afraid to ask for help , because most people of average height assumed they were also mentally handicapped . It was not uncommon for little people to be sexually abused and molested by those who saw them as mere children , though they were endowed with the minds and appetites of adults . The meeting had been booked in the Midwest , in a place called Impton . The agent told Levanter that when he went there to inspect the facilities and to reserve rooms in hotels and motels for the conventioneers , none of the managers had ever heard of the Alliance of Small Americans . Thus , when he requested only hand-held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chairs , the managers assumed that Small Americans were Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts . The agent laughed as he told Levanter that he had done nothing to disabuse them . " I 'd like to be there in Impton , " he said chuckling , " to see all their faces when these assorted dwarfs and midgets start descending upon them . " Curious about how such things went in his adopted country , Levanter landed at the airport that serviced Impton and two other neighboring townships , rented a car , and drove to the center of town . He went straight to the Taft , the largest hotel , which advertiseditself as " unconventionally superconventional , " and took a room . The desk clerk handed him a guest registration card . Levanter looked up at the huge banner suspended from the ceiling : THE TAFT WELCOMES ALLIANCE OF SMALL AMERICANS : THE SCOUTS OF TODAY , THE LEADERS OF TOMORROW . " Who are these Small Americans ? " Levanter asked the clerk while filling in the card.  | " Just boys and girls from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " said the clerk . " How many are coming ? " " A few hundred . Some might arrive tonight , the rest tomorrow . " He glanced at Levanter inquisitively . " You here on busi-ness ? " Levanter smiled . " Looking for business . " " It 's all the same , is n't it ? " The man returned the smile . After dinner at the hotel , Levanter strolled over to the registrationdesk and leaned against the far end . A number of people were milling about the lobby : a couple with five children waiting for their luggage so they could depart , two businessmen who had just arrived , and several elderly men and women of the sort always found in the lobbies of respectable hotels , sitting , drowsing , reading , or just idly watching each other and the people who pass through . Suddenly , a tiny man came through the revolving door . He was less than three feet tall , fat and pursy , his head nearly as big as his torso , his arms so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbows . He approached the desk and , in a squeaky voice , asked the clerk to send a bellhop out to collect the luggage he had left outside with his wife . He then reached up , took a registration card , and , using his knee for support , began filling it in , writing with his left hand . " Did you see what I just saw ? " the clerk whispered to Levanter when the short man walked away . " It 's a big country , " said Levanter . " A lot of left-handed people . " The clerk looked puzzled . " Left-handed ? A lefty is one thing , a freak is another . Why , this fellow is shorter than my six-year-old kid . " " Will your kid grow any taller ? " asked Levanter . " That is n't funny , Mister , " said the clerk . Just then the little man returned , accompanied by a fat woman , an inch or two taller than he . She had a round face , double chin , full bosom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room stared at the newcomers . The departing family clustered together , the five kids peeking out from behind their parents , mocking the waddle of the little couple . A few senior citizens who had dozed off in easy chairs woke up and , adjusting their glasses , blinked at the spectacle . The two businessmen stood dumfounded , dangling their room keys . The couple went up to the desk . Standing on tiptoe , they called out their names and asked for their room . The man said the reservations for the conventioneers had been made for the whole group , but he and his wife had arrived early . " What convention ? " asked the clerk . The little man proudly pointed to the identification tag on his lapel . " Small Americans ! What else ? " he said . " Are your kids the delegates ? " the clerk asked . " We do n't have any children , " said the woman . " We are the delegates , " the man said emphatically . The clerk glanced toward the cashier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately looked in n't click right away that some grownups would be accompanying the kids , " he said cheerfully . " Not grownups ' ! " the small man corrected him with a smile . " Adults ! " " I did n't mean it that way ! Adults , of course ! " Sheepishly the clerk handed the room key to the bellhop . The little couple went to the elevator , followed by the bellhop , who could not restrain his snickering . Levanter was still standing next to the desk . " In this line of work you have to expect anything , " said the clerk , rubbing his forehead . " How was Ito know that these two worked with the Scouts ? Adults , indeed ! " he chortled . " It 's a big country ! " Levanter said once more . The clerk had just settled down behind his desk when the revolvingdoor spun around again . Three little women and four tiny menp100came through and advanced toward the desk . The clerk , engrossed in his work , did not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Levanter . The clerk stood up . When he saw the group , an expression of utter disbelief crossed his face . Open-mouthed , the cashier stared at the midgets . Everyone in the lobby turned toward the registrationdesk . The new arrivals were barely as tall as the desk . All wore convention identification tags . " Are you all delegates to the Scout convention ? " the desk clerk asked , nodding toward the banner over the entrance . " Do you mean to the Small Americans convention ? " asked one woman . " Yes , that 's the one . " " We are . What do Scouts have to do with it ? " asked one of the men . " It 's their convention , that 's what , " answered the clerk , handing the group registration cards . " If you mean the Alliance of Small Americans , then it is ours , " another man said . " Scouts have nothing to do with it . " " I do n't believe there are very many Scouts in the Alliance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean there are n't many Scouts ? " The clerk was now on the verge of panic . " We 've prepared the whole place for them . Why , we even installed additional bunks in a number of rooms so that many of the kids could be together ! Look at that ! " Once again he gestured toward the banner . " It 's your banner , not ours , " said one man . " Maybe the Scouts are having a convention at the same time , " said one of the women . The clerk did not answer . By now he seemed to have grasped the hotel 's misunderstanding . Word that the little people had come spread to other parts of the hotel . Soon cooks in white hats , waitresses in aprons , and patrons with napkins tucked under their chins crowded into the lobby to get a good look . As the new guests marched off to the elevator throughp101the throng of spectators , two hotel technicians , trying to be inconspicuous , started to take down the banner . Levanter walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hotel came rushing in . Laughing so hard he could barely speak , he tried to tell everyone what he had seen . " What 's going on ? " Levanter asked . The waiter 's shoulders were shaking . " Would you believe there 's a busload of freaks over there ? " " It 's a big country , " said Levanter offhandedly . The waiter ignored his remark . " Would you believe they 're all little pygmy people no taller than that ? " he went on , bringing his hand to the level of the barstool . By now all the patrons had left the bar for the Taft . Levanter decided to take a drive through town . It was only nine o'clock but the main street was already almost deserted . A few teen-agers drove by , the finish on their polished cars reflecting brightly lit shop windows , the roar of their superchargedengines competing with blasts of music or chatter from their Citizens Band radios . Levanter passed the town hall , two department stores , a bowling alley and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three banks , a shopping mall , the police station , and the bus and railroad terminals . Within fifteen minutes , he had crossed downtown Impton twice . He stopped for gas on the outskirts of town . The station attendantpeered closely at Levanter , then at the car , as he filled the tank . " The wheels are local , but you 're not , " he said with a friendly smile as he wiped the windshield . " I 'm not , " Levanter said . " By-passing Impton ? " " Passing through . For a day or two . " " You 'll never guess who stopped here for gas ten minutes ago , " said the man , leaning through the window . " How about some midgets ? " said Levanter , looking up at the sky.  | " I 'll be darned ! " he exclaimed . " How did you know ? " " It had to be someone you do n't see very often , " said Levanter . " Good thinking ! " the attendant agreed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circus : Seven Dwarfs in one small car . Bet I do n't see a sight like that again for the next twenty years ! " " Do n't bet on it , " Levanter said as he paid for the gas . " You might see some more small miracles before the night 's over . " " That 'll be the day ! " The man was chuckling as Levanter pulled away . Back at the hotel , Levanter found a small table in a far corner of the crowded , noisy bar . He ordered a drink and settled back to observe the scene . The Taft bar was the best in town , and most of the patrons , all prosperous-looking , seemed to be locals who knew one another . A group of Small Americans  --  five men and three women  --  appeared at the door . The room immediately became quiet . Everyone turned to look . Several couples at the back of the room stood up , straining to get a view of the little people , who did not seem to mind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one of them , a man with a flattened nose and exaggerated chest , asked a startled waiter to seat them , but not on the high barstools . The waiter led the group to two side tables , which , with some effort , they helped him push together . Seated there in a bunch , with their round faces , bulging necks , fatty arms , and stubby hands and fingers , they could have served as models for a human still-life theme  --  a bowl of plums , doughnuts , and bonbons . The hum of voices started up again . But the Small Americans remained the focus of attention . Many of the patrons could not take their eyes off them and lost interest in the sedate conversations at their own tables . Only one person in the entire room , a woman at the bar , seemed unaffected by the presence of the Small Americans . She had glanced at them indifferently and then had resumed talking to the two men she was with . A brunette , with subtle features , a shapely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her midtwenties . Every time she laughed , men and women at nearby tables drew their eyes away from the Small Americans and glanced furtively at her . By midnight , when the little people got up to go , the brunette and her two companions were among the few patrons left . All three seemed tired and a bit drunk and were not speaking much to each other . The expression on the woman 's face was one of boredom as she scanned the almost empty room . When she noticed Levanter , her eyes showed a flicker of interest . As her companions watched , she picked up her drink , walked over to him , a bit unsteady , smiling as if they were acquainted . Before Levanter could offer her a chair , she sat down at his table , her back to the bar . " Please do n't mind my doing this , " she said , her speech a little slurred . " Can you smile ? Pretend you know me . I want to get rid of those two at the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-by to the two men she had been sitting with and watched them walk out . " I 'm Jolene . One of Impton 's foremost beauties , in case you have n't noticed , " she said . " I 've noticed . I 'm George Levanter . " " Do you mind if I have my drink at your table ? " she asked . " With me or alone ? " he asked . She laughed . " With you of course . " She took a sip , then sat quietly for a few moments . " Did you see the Lilliputians ? " Levanter nodded . " They 'll freak this town out , " she said . " What are you doing here ? " Levanter told her about the New York booking agent and how he had decided to visit Impton because of the convention . He could n't tell whether Jolene believed him . " This is a scared town , " she said . " Recently , for example , a sick guy was beating and raping women hitchhikers . The newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept right on hitchhiking and kept right on getting into this guy 's car . I heard a radio interview with one of the ones who was raped . She said it was her fault because she had hitchhiked , and now she was trying to be lessp104paranoid about it . " Her voice rose . " Can you believe it ? Here 's a girl who was raped and beaten , yet she blames herself for it and says she 's trying to be less paranoid . That 's Impton for you . " " And what is it for you ? " asked Levanter . " My hometown , " she said with a shrug . " I was born here , the only child of Anglo-Saxon parents . Very distinguished Scottish stock ! Descendant of a proud line of local embalmers , auto technicians , wholesalers , food processors , and low-rank military . " She lit a cigarette , inhaled deeply , then , in the same self-deprecating but jocular tone , asked , " The rest of the picture ? " Levanter nodded encouragement .

She put out the cigarette she had just lit . Bluntly , Levanter suggested they go upstairs to his room . Withouta word , she stood up . As they walked through the bar , Levanterfelt the bartender and waiters watching their exit . Crossing the lobby , they passed one of the hotel guards , who recognizedp105Jolene and bowed to her but pretended not to see Levanter . " It 's not often that people here notice anything , " said Jolene as they waited for the elevator . " Last week , a fourteen-year-old kid who had driven a car only once before stole an airport bus from downtown . He drove straight to the arrivals terminal , picked up a full load of passengers , collected their fares , and headed back to town , dropping passengers off at stops along the way . Then , somewhere on the highway , he sideswiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kid jumped out of the moving bus . Luckily , the truck driver pulled in front of the bus and after a small crash made it stop . Only then did the passengers realize something was wrong . So much for our observant townsfolk ! " She laughed . " Still , they seem to know you here , " said Levanter , feeling a bit uneasy . " My hometown , remember ? " " And you do n't mind that they know what you 're doing ? " " What do I care what they think ? They do n't pay my bills . " Holding her head high , she looked around the lobby defiantly , but there were no more witnesses . When they entered his room , she quickly took off her dress and slip . Next , she kicked off her shoes . Then , lying back on the bed and lifting her hips , she hooked her thumbs under the top of her pantyhose and smoothly slid them off . Underneath was a G-string . She sat up , piled her hair on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders . Levanter undressed in the bathroom . When he came back in his robe , she was still wearing her brassiere and G-string . Jolene asked for a drink . He poured one for each of them , then sat on the sofa across from the bed and watched as she slowly sipped hers . She noticed Levanter eyeing her bra and G-string . " It 's called a grope suit . They 're easy to get anywhere in the country  --  in sex boutiques in big cities or by mail order in small ones . " She stared up at the ceiling . " The patch in front is covered with human hair . The main feature is the rubber rod inside . It stimulates you everyp106time you move . The bra too . Each cup has a snug hollow on each side that massages your nipple and little rubber things all over that gently rub your breast . A lovely sensation . " She paused , waiting for Levanter 's reaction . When he did not respond , she kept on talking . " Whenever I visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to say hello . While we were talking , I 'd look them straight in the eye and then , right there , I would just move or bend slightly or press deeper into my chair , and I would come , over and over again . The best part was the fun of seeing if I could control the expression on my face so no one would know what was going on inside me . " Her gaze lingered on the threadbare rug at the side of the bed . " When I was a little girl , I 'd play with myself , but never in front of anyone . Now I do it with people watching me , and they never know what I 'm doing . " She sat quite still . They could hear a faint buzz of voices from the hotel corridor . Levanter refilled her glass . " I began wearing my grope suit everywhere , " she continued . " Even under my bathing suit . I wore it to go shopping , to dinners with my in-laws , to picnics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often find myself talking politely about this or that with Impton 's finest . Then , out of the corner of my eye I 'd see this type giving me an obliging smile  --  you know , one of those guys who 's so proud of his hairy chest , the kind who pretends to take life and women as they come . I 'd encourage him by smiling back . And as he was walking over to introduce himself , I 'd turn toward him , and the rubbing of the rod and the bra would arouse me like crazy . I 'd be all heated up and come even before I could tell him I was married . And the jerk would never know how well I was doing without him . " Levanter listened without stirring . " I once wore my secret to church , " she said . " Even there , with Greg and his family , I could not resist the temptation . But every time I knelt , I felt a little damned when that drive took hold of me. "  |p107She  finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm wearing my secret tonight , Mr. Levanter . Are you willing to compete with it ? " Without waiting for an answer , she unhooked her brassiere and took it off . After a slight delay , she removed the G-string . She did not display her costume , but as she stood up , naked , and carried it across the room on her way to the bathroom , Levanter could see that her description was accurate . When she came back into the room , Levanter was ready for her . Without warning , he grabbed her by the waist and forced her down onto the floor . She did not resist . For a moment , he lay still on top of her , feeling her cool skin . Then he pinned her down , wedging his legs between hers , spreading her wide apart . He flung her arms over her head with one hand and held her wrists still until she was flat and taut . To make certain she was pinioned , he first trailed his other hand idly over her body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could n't free herself from his hold . He sank into her suddenly . She strained and twisted , but he rammed into her , battering her with all his weight , smacking her loins , each butt tearing the tender tissues of her flesh , pounding her back against the floor . She began to scream . Levanter covered her lips with his , stifling her sounds . He exhaled his breath into her mouth , pressing her throat with his hand ; throttled , her excitement accelerated , swelling the veins in her face and neck . Starved for air , she ripped her hands free , clenching and unclenchingthem convulsively as if trying to grasp the air itself . A shudder rippled through her . Levanter removed his mouth from hers , and , like a hysterical child on the verge of both laughter and tears , she screamed , trying to wrest herself away from the weight of his body . She opened her mouth , struggling for breath , and in her exertion arched her body , gasping . Then she went limp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for air , and his eyes blurred . For a moment , everything went black . When she came to , she wearily ran her hands through her dishev/eled hair . Her expression was soft , and she looked as if she were trying to smile . She traced her fingers listlessly over her body , gently cupping her breasts , raising her knees . Drops of perspiration glistened on her belly . She reached for him , and drew him close to her . After a few moments , she squatted with her back to his outstretchedbody . Her feet were between his thighs , her hands pressingon his knees . She started swaying and her buttocks grazed and stroked his flesh until he could stand it no longer and wanted to pull free of her . Then she slid back over him , until her damp flesh was over his face . He could hardly breathe . As she leaned forward , her breasts rubbed against his belly , her hair fell over his thighs . He felt her mouth around his flesh ; like a rampant growth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his parched mouth and intense thirst , and no longer willing to fight her , he gave in to the tension that swelled within him . They woke up late the next morning . She was bruised and moved with difficulty . They went downstairs . The hotel lobby was swarming with Small Americans . A new banner , STAND TALL AND BE COUNTED , announced the opening of the convention . They drove through town in her open convertible . Levanter noticed several passers-by staring at the two of them with obvious hostility . He asked Jolene what angered them , and she said it was simply the unthinking reaction of the townspeople who had known her for a long time and were unaccustomed to seeing her openly consorting with a stranger . She took Levanter to lunch at the Impton Inn , the best restaurant in town . The hostess who escorted them to their table was polite to Jolene but curt with Levanter . While they were eating , a group of well-dressed men and women arrived and were seated at a table nearby . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when his eyes fell on Jolene his jaw tightened . He looked searchingly at Levanter.  | " Who is he ? " asked Levanter . " That 's Greg , " she answered , unperturbed . " My click-click Greg . Remember ? " " And the others ? " Levanter asked . She turned to look at them again . " Friends , acquaintances . " " What do they do ? " " They 're all in business . " Levanter looked puzzled . " I thought you told me Greg was a lawyer ? " She played with her salad before she answered . " He gave up law when his father died and he inherited the family business . Now Greg is head of Impton Consolidated , one of the largest companies in the state . " " You were the wife of a very important man , " said Levanter , all at once aware of how little she had actually told him about herself . " I was , " said Jolene . " That 's why you 're being stared at . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , and Greg owns the company . Now that I 've left Greg , everyone thinks there 's no longer a place for me here . They think they can disown me . And they certainly do n't want you ! " She laughed , reaching for his hand and squeezing it in full view of the people at the other table . Levanter was comforted by the thought that he could fly back to New York as soon as he wished . " When did you leave Greg ? " he asked . " A few months ago . " " Is the separation legal ? " She let go of his hand . " It may not be legal , but it sure is clear-cut , as far as this town is concerned . " " But technically you 're still married to Greg , are n't you ? " Levanterpersisted . " Only technically . So what ? " She looked at him with a defiant expression . " Would n't you be better off leaving Impton ? " Levanter asked . " There was a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ,  | " to start a new life . But , like so many others before me , I discovered that in this country we belong to our families , our families do not belong to us . Only newcomers , like you , know how to change their lives overnight , how to develop new interests , take up differentprofessions , generate fresh emotions . " Levanter made no comment . She looked at him with an ironic smile . " I read in a magazine that the average American housewife does n't run away until she 's past thirty-five , has been married for at least fifteen years , and has one or two kids . And , quite likely , within a year she is traced by detectives solely because , in her new surroundings , she betrays herself by wearing the same hairdo , clothes , jewelry , and make-up . What 's more , she is likely to date a man who physically and professionally resembles the one she ran away from . " She took a few bites of her lunch . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I find strangers , as I found you . " She paused . " But something significant happened to me last night . " " What do you mean ? " he asked . " For years , I 've been hiding in my private maze , cut off and isolated . I did n't even know who I was anymore , " Jolene said with a nervous smile . " All the men I 've been with before you have been from around here . They 're as local as I am , and I knew the standards they judged me by  --  those are my standards too , after all . With you I should feel apprehension , since I do n't know what your standards are . But I do n't feel cautious at all . I am not afraid to say or do anything that might displease you , as I have been with other men . I 'm myself  --  it 's the ultimate risk . " " I 'm planning to leave tomorrow , " Levanter said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small Americans appeared in the doorway of the restaurant , lingering a moment on the threshold before they wandered uncertainly into the room . Again , as in the bar the night before , everyone looked at them and the voices in the room dropped to soft whispers . The hostess beckoned them haugh/tily to follow her and placed them in the farthest corner . As Levanter glanced about the room , he observed that in the Impton Inn today it was he , not the midgets , who got all the attention . After lunch , Jolene went home to rest . Levanter walked along the main street . He stopped in front of the window of a large general store , startled by the array of handguns , rifles , shotguns , ammunition , and holsters . Then he realized that the sale of guns was legal in the state , and no permit was required to own a weapon . Only a visitor would be startled by such a display . He entered the store , walking past magazine racks , shelves of personal-hygiene products , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man had just bought a rifle and two boxes of ammunition . The salesman placed two more boxes beside his purchase . " That 's on the house , " he said , as he wrote up the order . The customer paid , picked up his package , and left . The salesman turned to Levanter , smiling . " What can I do for you ? " Levanter studied the pistols and revolvers in the glass case . The salesman looked down at them also . " These are just a fewsamples of what we carry , " he said . " Tell me what kind of gun youown , and I 'll tell you what others you might still need . " " I do n't own a gun , " said Levanter . The salesman looked surprised . " Do you want something for defense or for a hobby ? " he asked . " Defense as a hobby , " said Levanter , smiling . " Nowadays , the only hobby a man needs , " the salesman agreed . He reached into the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mini-derringer ? A real five-shot beaut . Easy to load , easy to shoot , easy to conceal . " Levanter contemplated the revolver . With it , one 's creativity at the moment of danger was reduced to the crude squeezing of the trigger . He shook his head . The salesman leaned over the counter and said in a confidential tone , " Did you know that an awful lot of violence is committedp112against strangers ? Last year , over one third of those killed did not know their assailants . " He put the mini-derringer back in the case . " What line of business are you in ? " " Investing , " said Levanter . " Travel a lot ? " Levanter nodded . " Then how about this Bulldog forty-four ? " He pulled out another revolver . " An ideal featherweight , easy-to-hide gun . The best investment you can make these days . " Levanter pretended to be unconvinced . The salesman tried another tack . " Are you married or single ? " he asked . " Single . No children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , city or country ? " " Big cities . " The salesman pulled out two longer pistols . " One of these might do . The fifteen-shot Parabellum . Custom-made for mixed neighborhoods , you might say , if you know what I mean ! " He winked . " But for sure speed , here 's a true beast , " he said , passing another handgun to Levanter . " A real savage ! " he said . " Eleven shots in a single second ! As they say , it aims to please , it pleases to aim . " He looked proud of his wit . The gun felt cold and smooth in Levanter 's hand . " The other day a man comes in , " the salesman said . " He 's a black , a neat dresser , and speaks with an accent . So I think he 's one of those darky diplomats who do business with Impton Consolidatedfor one of those safari-land countries where the blacks kill each other like flies . " Levanter did not comment . The salesman went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns I handle : Browning , Beretta , Smith and Wesson , Winchester , Colt , Charter Arms , you name it ! He picks up a Mossberg twenty-gauge shotgun and pats it and feels it like a girl , and he aims it at the street like a toy . So I say , Sir , I 'll give you the best deal in town if you want a few hundred of these for your people ! ' And he smiles real sweetly at me and says , My people would sure love to use themp113every day ! ' So I ask , What country are you from , sir ? ' And he gives me this scary look and says , Harlem , New York ! ' " The salesman chuckled , his heavy belly bouncing up and down . Apologizing for not being able to make up his mind , Levanter put down the handgun . The salesman was close to giving up . It was a rare customer who did not find a gun that pleased him , he said . He put his elbow on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked up at Levanter as if seeing him in a new light . " Say , do you mind if I ask you a personal question ? " he asked . " Shoot ! " The salesman failed to notice Levanter 's little joke . He kept on . " Do you go out with a lot of women ? " Levanter nodded . The salesman recoiled . " Mostly with other men 's wives , I take it , " he said , a disapproving look on his face . " It was you this morning in Jolene 's car , was n't it ? " " It was , " said Levanter . " I knew it . I thought you looked familiar when you walked in here . Do n't you cross Greg that way again , " he whispered . " What if I do ? " asked Levanter with a smile . The salesman backed away from the counter . " Let me give it to you straight : if you do , you do n't need a gun  --  you need a tank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the counter . Levanter walked back to the Taft . As he was about to enter the revolving door , he was stopped by a solid-looking police officer , tall , with closely cropped gray hair . Wearing a well-fitting uniform , puffing gracefully on his pipe , he introduced himself courteously as the Chief of Police . He recognized Levanter , he explained with a polite smile , from a description given him by one of his deputies . He suggested that Levanter accompany him to the police station to discuss what he termed " a delicate matter . " Levanter got into the police car . At the station house , the Chief led Levanter into a small office and shut the door . They were alone . The Chief gestured Levanter to a chair and sat down opposite him.  | " You could have refused to come here with me , Mr. Levanter , " he said , " but you 're reasonable and so you did not . Now I hope you will listen to me and continue to be reasonable . " He placed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Levanter slowly shook his head . " If you are about to tell me I ought to get out of Impton , " he said , " I can spare you the trouble . I 've already made plans to return to New York tomorrow . " The Chief nodded sympathetically . He pulled his chair closer to Levanter 's . " Now why do you think I want you out of town ? " he asked . " Because of Jolene . " The Chief got up and walked to the window . He stared out at the street for several seconds , then spun around and made a sweeping motion with his hands , as though brushing away Levanter 's remark . " The truth is , " he said , stressing each word , " that I want you to stay in Impton . About a month will do . " " Why on earth would I stay in Impton for a month ? " asked Levanter . The Chief picked up his pipe and tapped the bowl . " Because you 're needed here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom ? " The Chief plucked at the creases in his trousers , then looked at Levanter mildly , as if to placate him for what he was going to say . " Let me begin by saying you 're needed by me , needed by Greg , and needed by the folks of this town . " " I still intend to leave tomorrow , " Levanter said sternly . The Chief thought for a moment , then said , " And I 've got the means to make sure you do n't slip away when my back is turned . " A faint smile crossed his face . " Under county regulations , members of the police force are allowed to moonlight in uniform during off-duty hours and can hold security jobs for private employers . You know , like guards for nightclubs or apartment houses , banks , and so on . As for me "  --  he pushed out his chest and drew in his belly  --  " I moonlight by hiring out off-duty police as security guards for all branches of Impton Consolidated . They wear their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives thep115boys a nice extra income and cuts down on the temptation for graft ! And so , " he said with a grin , " I hope I can persuade you not to leave Impton . " " A real guns-for-hire setup , " said Levanter . " Would any one of these guys act if he saw his generous employer doing something wrong ? Has anybody in this town or in the state ever complained about conflict of interest ? " he asked . " Would you like to be the first to try ? " the Chief asked sarcastically . Then , his voice becoming slightly sharper , he said , " In any case , Greg wants an uncontested divorce from Jolene . She 's nothing but a whore . She refused to give him a divorce and thought she could force him into a financial settlement by openly carrying on with out-of-towners every weekend . But her blackmail has n't worked . Not only that . Because of her filthy behavior she has lost any right she might have had to their daughter . " " Jolene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Levanter said . " They have the sweetest little girl in town . There are probably a lot of things Jolene did n't tell you , George . But when she picked you up , even she did n't know she had picked up the one lover who was going to be her undoing . " Levanter squirmed . " How am I so different from all the others ? " " You 're the first real stranger , and an alien too : no business or political connections , no family , no church , no community around here to claim you . You do n't even have a decent reason to be in Impton . " " You 've certainly done your homework , Chief . How did you find out all this ? " The Chief shrugged , giving Levanter a disarming smile . " On the telephone , " he said , pleased with himself . " I started with the car rental . You gave some references there . I followed those leads and ended up talking with that ass of a booking agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the real kids we were expecting . " He paused , as if deciding whether to tell Levanter the rest . Then he continued , " And just before you and I met , my deputy radioed me that you were about to buy yourself a handgunp116but could n't find one to your liking . " He pointed to the gun riding in his holster . " Customized Magnum Blackhawk . Six-and-a-halfinchbarrel . Hundred-and-fifty-yard range ! Six seconds to reload , " he boasted . " Last year it sure helped me to win the State Police Combat Championships ! " Levanter glanced at the gun . " Would you use it to prevent me from leaving Impton ? " he asked . " Glad you asked , " the Chief snapped . With one of the keys on his large ring , he unlocked a drawer in the desk . He pulled out the drawer , placing it on top of the desk , right in front of Levanter . In it , Levanter saw a pistol equipped with a silencer , a snub-nosed revolver , a Swiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug vials . The Chief moved closer to Levanter , towering over him . " A teacher at the Police Academy who spoke with an accent a bit like yours , " he said , " once explained to us that in this nation people in fifty states are governed by over a million different laws , and they defend themselves against these laws with over a hundred million guns . " Looking attentively at Levanter , he paused . " And so it is only our Constitution and our television that bind us together . " He grinned jovially . " With the exception , of course , of aliens and criminals , who are first bound together by the FBI that fingerprintedthem all . " Like a card player about to make his final bid , he grew serious . " You are an alien , George , a member of that special clan of the fingerprinted . I would like you now to pick up all the objects you see in this drawer , one at a time , and then put them back ! " He pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uncalled-for threat . " What if I refuse ? " he asked . " You know the odds . I 'll make sure you pick them up anyway . " The Chief laughed softly , patting his holster again . Reluctantly , Levanter picked up and replaced the articles , one by one . When he finished , the Chief carefully wrapped them in paper , replaced the drawer , and locked it . He looked hard at Levanter . " Ip117reckon you 'll make a perfect witness for Greg , " he said , nodding . " With you and your accent on the stand , that bitch , that used-up piece of trash , wo n't have a chance in court . " He opened the door for Levanter . " Right before might , " he said , smiling . Driving back to the Taft , the Chief turned to look at Levanter . " So many trailer parks around here "  --  he spoke slowly and distinctly  --  " there 's always some crime being committed by hoods we do n't know , felons from out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . " If you leave this town before I tell you to , any one of the gismos you just fingerprinted will be found near the scene of a crime : a nice proof that you committed it during your stay here . Even a fancy lawyer from New York ca n't help you here . So you see , George , I have stuck you to the cross without nails ! " Evidently pleased with this conclusion , he drove without speakingfor a few minutes . Then he turned again to his passenger . " Last year , one of those American Nazi Party lunatics went on trial here for beating up a decent man of the Jewish faith who was attending a convention . Well , the judge and the lawyers reckoned that with a Nazi against a Jew , with all the public knowledge of what the Nazis did to the Jews , they did n't have a prayer of finding an unbiased jury ! " He gave a hearty laugh . " I 'll tell you , they could n't have been more wrong ! Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazis and Jews during the Second World War could tell what exactly went wrong between them ! The only people in these parts who hate Nazis are the ones who put Nazis and Communists in the same bag . Now you "  --  he paused  --  " you went to a Communist university down there , in Moscow . You were a Communist , were n't you ? " " In a Communist country , all the universities are Communist . But I was not , " said Levanter . The Chief listened absent-mindedly , then continued . " Imagine yourself on trial . Let 's say , for murder . A jury here would no more believe what you say about why you came all the way to Impton than they would believe that you were not a Communist , or that youp118were fingerprinted ' by Impton 's Chief of Police ! " He chuckled . Levanter shrugged and took a small mirror from his jacket pocket . " What are you doing ? What 's that ? " he asked . " It 's a mirror , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished glass backed by silver coating to form images by the reflection of rays of light . Also known as a looking glass . " " I know what a mirror is ! " the Chief cut in . " But you just asked what it was ! " The Chief was annoyed . " Why do you carry a mirror ? " " To see myself . I ca n't think of any better way . " As the Chief watched him scornfully , Levanter looked at himself in the mirror and combed his hair . " I do n't like to see you do that to yourself , " said the Chief , grimacing . " Just keep in mind that at Jolene 's trial you 'll testify as a ladies ' man , not a men 's . " They arrived at the hotel , and Levanter stepped out of the car . The Chief gave him a long , searching look . " Now you behave yourself , George , you hear ! You do n't , and I 'll find you a bride right here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then you 'll never leave Impton ! " Bored and restless during his unexpectedly prolonged stay in Impton , Levanter would flip through the local newspaper for interestingitems . There was a famous research laboratory just outside of town , and one day , Levanter spotted a reference to the man in charge , a scientist he had met with Jacques Monod a few years before . He decided to take a ride out . The scientist remembered him and was delighted to have the opportunity to show the complex of laboratories to a visitor . When most of his staff had left for the day , he took Levanter on a tour of the research facilities . Levanter had been educated in the humanities and had little background in science . Even though his host tried to avoid technicalterminology , to Levanter his explanations of various instruments and installations sounded like pure science fiction.  | " This , " said the scientist , pointing through a window at a giant structure , " contains a linear accelerator . The energy used just to turn it on would dim all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What would happen if such a mechanism blew up ? " asked Levanter . Mildly amused , the scientist waved his hand . " For a layman , there is , of course , a certain degree of strangeness in all this , " he said , " but I can assure you it 's all as safe as a baby 's cradle . " They entered another lab . " This is an ultra-centrifuge rotor , " he said . " The rotor is balanced on a flexible wire . If the wire should snap , the rotor would spin off like a projectile  --  with enough force to go through a thick wall of concrete . " Again Levanter asked , " What are the chances of such an acci-dent ? " The scientist dismissed his fears . " Practically zero , " he said . Levanter was shown a number of scientific achievements : tanks that stored liquid nitrogen at minus one hundred and ninety degrees ; an electron microscope through which one could view the atoms in a speck of gold ; rows of rooms with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slicing matter into sections thinner than wavelengths of visible light ; and many other scientific marvels the uses of which he did not understand . Then he took Levanter to his own microbiology laboratory , where he handed him a white lab coat to put on . They went through two sets of heavy doors , separated by an empty vestibule , and entered a large room . " This is the core of our research on immunology and cell culture , " he said . He switched on the lights . Every side of the room was filled with stacked cages full of mice . As Levanter looked around , he saw a mouse run across the floor to hide under a stack of cages . The scientist did not see the animal . " The temperature of this room is automatically monitored , " he said . " To prevent even the slightest indirect contact between mice in various test groups , the air , spread in linear sheets , is replaced in the room one hundred and sixty times an hour . That 's why "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet there are two thousand of them , in more than a hundred cages . " Levanter shook his head in amazement . The scientist went on . " We inject each group of mice with a particular serum , " he explained . " The crucial element is keeping the mice in every cage totally separate from all the others . That 's why the air does n't mix in here ; why it flows vertically , in sheets . " " Could a mouse escape from a cage ? " Levanter asked casually . The scientist smiled . " These cages are specially designed to make it impossible , " he said . " As you see "  --  he drew Levanter over to the cages  --  " the cage grillwork is so narrow that not even the smallest mouse could possibly squeeze through . " " But could n't a mouse escape when it is being put in or taken out of its cage for inoculations ? " asked Levanter . " Not a chance ! The mice are handled one at a time by a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed to be amused by Levanter 's skepticism . Levanter bent down as if to tie his shoelace . Under the stack of cages he could see the small white mouse , its nostrils twitching , its whiskers quivering . He straightened up . " Assuming the impossible , " Levanter persisted , " what would happen if , let 's say , one mouse managed to escape and to move about the room unnoticed for a while ? " " Assuming the impossible , " the scientist said , humoring his visitor , " the mouse would probably sniff and touch other mice through the grillwork , thereby contaminating all of them . Since our research is based on collecting tissues from mice in strictly separated test groups , this would render the entire project invalid . That 's why it 's unthinkable . " Clearly considering the matter closed , he reached for the light switch , ready to leave the room . Levanter stopped him gently . " What if I told you , " he said slowly , " that when we entered this room I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scientist looked at him . " I 'd know that you were suffering from a momentary illusion . "  | " And if I insist I saw a mouse ? " " That you are a victim of hallucination ! " " If I swear I saw it ? " " That you are paranoid ! " He laughed . " How certain are you that at this very moment a mouse is not loose in this room ? " Levanter persisted . The scientist turned to Levanter as if to open a formal debate . " Absolutely certain . I know how this lab is run . This stage of our research has been specifically devised to avoid such slip-ups . Only the most reliable and responsible scientists handle the mice , and their research  --  in immunology , cell culture , and fractionation , for example  --  depends on what originates here , on accurately injecting the mice in one test group with serum , and on careful control against mishap . We are meticulous and vigilant in this lab . " He scrutinized Levanter 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to give up . " Still and all , what is the probability of finding an escaped mouse in this room now ? " he asked with a grin . " It 's zero , " said the scientist . " After all , a mouse is not an atom , " he added . " Here , where we 're accustomed to dealing with the tiniest particles of matter , a mouse would loom larger than an elephant . " " Would you stake your life against such a possibility ? " " I certainly would . " " And this laboratory ? " " Certainly . " Levanter got down on his knees and looked under the stack of cages . The mouse still crouched there , staring at him . He reached toward it , and the mouse ran straight out into the middle of the room . There , encountering the scientist , it backed a foot away from him . Motionless , the scientist and the animal stared at each other . The blood drained from the man 's face , his eyes went blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both men remained still , scurried across the room and hid once again under the cages . Ap122long moment passed . The scientist regained control of himself and pressed an alarm button . A young research assistant rushed into the room . The scientist could barely control his rage . " There 's a mouse loose in this room ! " he snapped . The young man was incredulous . " That 's just not possible , sir ! " he said . " I saw it ! It 's hiding under the cages ! " exclaimed the scientist . " It 's an illusion ! " said the assistant mildly . " You know as well as I do that no mouse could ever escape . " " I tell you I saw it ! " the scientist repeated with emphasis . Clearly unconvinced , the young man nonetheless apparentlywanted to accommodate his superior . " I once thought I saw amouse too , " he said . The scientist was on the verge of losing his temper . As he stepped toward the cages , the mouse ran out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cages on the opposite side . Flushed and stricken , the young man stared at the floor . " I do n't understand how  --  it just could n't  --  " he mumbled . Without a word , the scientist left the room . Levanter followed . " Well , worse things happen , " said the scientist when they were outside . " Oil tankers break in half . Jumbo jets collide . Flu vaccinesparalyze . General competence and individual responsibility are on the decline , you know . " Thinking aloud , the scientist went on . " Now all the mice will have to be replaced , and everything based on the data we supplied to other research centers must be declared invalid . So will most of the findings we released for presentation at scientific congresses , seminars , and other conferences . A wipe-out . " Levanter could n't think of anything to say to him . " A human error , " the scientist said , " and we 'll probably never know whose . Still , Impton Consolidated will continue to pay the bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What luck that you offered to stay and be a witness for Greg at his unfortunate divorce trial . "  |p123Both  sides of the busy New York street were filled with cars , so Levanter had to double-park . But before he could turn off the engine , a police squad car came along on the other side of the street and pulled up across from him . A sergeant rolled down the window and leaned out . " No double-parking . Move ! " he shouted . " I ca n't , " Levanter called back . The sergeant stepped out of his car and crossed over , hands on his hips . " What do you mean ca n't ' ? You just move ! " Levanter took his wallet from his back pocket . He opened it and slowly removed his driver 's license and a laminated card . The card identified him as a member of the American Council for Global Security , Washington , D.C. The Council was a small educational society which regularly polled its members for their views on such issues as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength and reported the results in its monthly mimeographed newsletter . Membership in the Council was open to the general public for an annual fee of five dollars , which included the newsletter subscription and a membership card . Levanter had joined as soon as he returned home from Impton . He handed the sergeant his driver 's license and , purposelyp124hesitating , the membership card . " You guys do your job , we do ours , " he said indifferently . The sergeant glanced at the license , and then examined the membership card . Levanter watched him study the Council 's symbol : an American eagle , clutching theglobe , with the credo PEACE THROUGH VIGILANCE above it , bracketedby two military insignia stars . Just as Levanter had hoped , the sergeant , sharing the confusion caused by a series of public disclosures about the White House , the CIA , and the FBI , assumed that the Council was yet another of the government 's elitist intelligence units and that Levanter was one of its agents . He scanned the surrounding buildings , then bent closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whispered , furrowing his brow in an expression of complicity . " As you see , " Levanter assured him . Without further question , the sergeant returned the license and card . " Are they really in this crummy block ? " He shook his head in disbelief . " They are everywhere . But so are we , " whispered Levanter , winking . " Right you are . " The sergeant saluted , returned to his car , and , waving at Levanter , drove away . Levanter turned off his engine . He picked up two bundles of shirts from the rear seat and carried them into the laundry . As Levanter placed the bundles on the counter , the Chinese shopkeeperreached for them . Levanter stopped him . " The shirts in this pile are just to be washed , " he said . " Only the ones in the other pile are to be starched . Please be careful not to mix them up . " The muscles in the face of the Chinese tightened . He grabbed both mounds of shirts and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he handed Levanter a receipt . Levanter took the ticket from him and carefully placed it in his wallet . " Too bad you 're disregarding my instructions , " he continued in an even , calm voice . " I 'll pick them up tomorrow , and I hope there 'll be no mistake . " He leaned slightly toward the man in exaggerated politeness . The man turned around , picked up thep125bag , and , almost running , disappeared into the back room . When Levanter came back the next day to collect his shirts , the Chinese took his ticket without looking at him or saying anything . He handed Levanter two packages and turned away . Levanter put down an envelope he was carrying and tore open both packages . Almost immediately he saw that one of two shirts of identical fabric had been starched . Summoning the shopkeeper , he pointed to the starched shirt . " I warned you not to mix up my shirts , " he said firmly . " And now look what you 've done ! " The man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Levanter . " Even a child could see that these two shirts are made of the same delicate fabric , which must not be starched . But you could n't see it and used starch on one . Now that shirt is damaged . Do you expect to charge me for such inferior work ? " The Chinese became apoplectic ; the veins swelled in his forehead , his eyes bulged in their sockets . He backed away from the counter and started to stamp on the floor , hitting his thighs with his clenched fists . He gasped , apparently searching for English words , but instead ranted something in Chinese . " It seems you have forgotten not only how to launder shirts and how to speak English , " said Levanter coolly , " but also how to behave like a true Chinese . " He began to gather up his shirts . The man stepped forward again , close to the counter . He had found his English . " I can forget America , " he said . " I can forget English . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  " He seemed to be planning a decisive verbal attack . " You , " he repeated slowly , pointing at Levanter , " you can not forget what you do not know . " As if proud of his logic , he laughed hysterically . " You can not forget China because you have never been there , " he repeated . " The Chinese people are very proud . They would never let your kind in , " he declared triumphantly . He leaned against the counter . " Now go out of my Chinese store . " " I am about to leave , " said Levanter calmly . " But I knew your thoughts in advance , so look what I have brought to show you . " He reached for his envelope and drew out an eight-by-ten black/and-white glossy press photograph of himself surrounded by Chinese officials , standing under a large poster of Mao Tse-tung in front of Peking 's Great Hall of the People . The man took the picture , glanced at it , then brought it closer to his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny scraps and , screaming incoherently in English and Chinese , scatteredthe pieces like confetti around the shop . A black worker came running from the back room . When she saw her boss jumping around in a rage , her mouth dropped open . The Chinese was throwing the last scraps of the photo when he noticed her . Suddenlyhe sat down , quivering , his face in his hands , quietly sobbing . Levanter left his payment on the counter , picked up his shirts , and walked out . Returning home from a late dinner with friends , Levanter spottedan attractive prostitute standing in a knot of six Japanese men with attache cases in their hands and cameras around their necks . The woman was taller than all the men and her voice easily carried to Levanter , who stopped a few feet away from the group . " A screw 's a screw , " she was saying , sounding annoyed and impatient . " And if all you guys are with me in one room , you pay once for the room , but six times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily accented voices , the men argued that since she had to undress and dress only once , they would n't take as much of her time as six separate men . " A screw 's a screw , " repeated the woman . " Six screws is six screws . Take it or leave it . " But the Japanese men continued to bargain . She would save on taxi fares to and from her hotel , one reasoned . " Six screws is six times the money . That 's how I count , " she said . She began to lose her temper . " I 've had enough of your kind anyway . " A disagreement broke out among the men . Looking away from them , the woman saw Levanter . " Are you with them ? " she shouted accusingly at him . Levanter assured her he was n't . She turned her back on the Japanese andp127came to him . " Are you going out ? " she asked in a stern but inviting tone . She was young and fresh-looking , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " said Levanter . " Do n't you want to know if I 'm going in ? " She laughed , tossing her long , shiny hair . " Do you or do n't you want company ? " " Not company , " said Levanter . " You . " She told him her price . " There 's this place two minutes from here . " She named a midtown tourist hotel , took Levanter by the arm , and walked beside him , matching his long stride . As soon as they entered the brightly lit hotel room , she took his jacket and felt in all the pockets . Then she patted his pants pockets . Evidently confident that Levanter carried neither a weapon nor a detective 's badge , she began to stroke his hips more gently . Levanter handed her the money . " I can tell you do n't mind the light , " she said as she bolted the door . " Some guys do n't want to see what they do . " She stood in the center of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , examining herself in the large mirror across from the bed . Conscious of every gesture , she removed each article of clothing in a deliberate fashion until she was naked . As her gaze wandered over the mirror , her hands trailed down her belly , her fingers alternating with the palm of her hand in making long curved strokes , squeezing and kneading her flesh , then gliding back over her body . She extended her arm toward Levanter and pulled him beside her . As he watched the two of them in the mirror , she rubbed and pressed her body against his , flinging her arms around him , licking his neck all the way up to his ear while she unbuttoned his shirt and loosened his belt . As his hands stroked her thighs , Levanter saw her eyes in the mirror . Her gaze seemed to be directed beyond the reflection in the mirror ; he began to wonder whether she was performing for the benefit of someone else , whether he and the woman were being watched from the other side of the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hep128reached behind him and picked up an ashtray . Then , in a single motion , he pushed her aside and swung his arm as if to hurl the ashtray at the mirror . From behind the mirror came the muffled crash of an overturned chair and the sound of scrambling , of someone rushing away . Levanter sped out of the room into the corridor and forced open the door to the next room . He discovered that he was right . A movie camera , mounted on a tripod , was aimed at the back of the mirror , and he could see the woman dressing hastily in the room he had just left . All at once , two middle-aged men rushed forward and placed themselves between Levanter and the camera . " I want this film exposed right now , " said Levanter calmly . " Listen , you good-for-nothing creep ! " one shouted , stepping toward Levanter with clenched fists , as the other edged behind Levanter to cut him off from the door . Levanter did not move . He reached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security membership card , and pushed it under the nose of the man who had just shouted at him . " Take a look at this , " he said . The man took the card , scrutinized it carefully , then cautiously handed it to the other . Neither said anything as they returned the card to Levanter . They were clearly no longer in a fighting mood . In the next room the woman finished dressing , grabbed her bag , and , without a backward glance , ran out . " I 'm here on assignment , " said Levanter , putting the card back into his wallet . " And there are others like me in the hotel at this moment . Now , " he said in the most officious tone he could muster , " you have a choice : either you expose the film or we expose you . " The men looked at each other . Without a word , one opened the camera and pulled out the cartridge . " My gift to the Feds , " he said , handing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

"  |p129Ronsard-Thibaudet  Samael , President of the African Republic of Lotan , was a world-renowned essayist and the author of numerous works on the nature of language . Investors International had decided to honor him with its prestigious Humanitarian Award . Levanter , one of the organizers of the event , went to the New York hotel where President Samael 's entourage was staying . He had an appointment with the State Department official serving as Samael 's adviser during his visit and was given a careful security check by three United States Secret Service agents both before entering the elevator and as he stepped out of it . A tall , red-haired woman , with full breasts and unusually white skin , was waiting for Levanter at the door . Levanter mentally nicknamed her Oklahoma : a lot of everything but no detail to speak of . She introduced herself as President Samael 's adviser . Inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa , desk , and table , explaining that these were the detailed security plans for the InvestorsInternational dinner . President Samael was to be honored as a thinker and humanitarian . But since many Afro-Americans in the United States were fanatically opposed to his administration 's domestic reforms and foreign policies , his visit had turned into a political event , necessitating elaborate security measures . The State Department adviser was the liaison for the various federal and city agencies involved . Levanter looked over the list of notables invited to the dinner ; then he and Oklahoma started working on the final seating plan . There was a knock at the door , but Oklahoma made no move to answer it . Assuming that she expected him to respond , Levanter went to the door and opened it . He faced a handsome , slender man whose dense silver hair contrastedwith the black skin of his youthful face . The man was naked except for a pair of unusually narrow briefs . Such a tight ,  |p130s|parse  garment , Levanter thought with amusement , could go a long way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starched white shirt hung by its collar from the man 's forefinger . The man did not express any surprise at encountering a stranger at her door . Stepping past Levanter without speaking , he entered the room and went straight to the woman . He embraced her and whispered something in her ear . Levanter , ill at ease , remained at the door and looked away . But the man left as quickly as he had arrived , passing Levanter on his way out , still dangling his shirt . Levanter turned back into the room . Oklahoma , flushed , made no comment , and the two of them went on with their work as if nothing had happened . A few minutes later there was another knock at the door . This time Levanter ignored it , and the woman went to answer . The same man entered . He was wearing a tailored dark blue suit , starched white shirt , fashionable wide tie , and shiny , pointy-toed shoes . Levanter , who had seen many photographs of President Samael , although he had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose to greet him . Oklahoma led him over to Levanter and introduced them . PresidentSamael extended his hand and Levanter shook it . The Presidentstepped back , looked at him , then turned to Oklahoma . With a straight face , he said , " Mr. Levanter and I have met once before , but it was some time ago and we have both changed . " Addressing Levanter , he said , " You , Mr. Levanter , might even have forgotten our first meeting ! " " Indeed , Mr. President , " said Levanter with an equally solemn expression , " it was , after all , so long ago . " Samael smiled . Assuring Levanter that he was looking forward to the dinner , he kissed Oklahoma on her cheek and left . As Levanter and Oklahoma settled down to work again , Levanter remarked that President Samael was a very charming man . The adviser raised her head and nodded . " A fine gentleman , " she said . After a moment , she added solemnly , " And always smartly dressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended a gala , where he was introduced to an Arab diplomat , a former Interpol official . A handsome man with dark , intense eyes , the Arab carried himself with an air of detachment . He offered to take Levanter for a ride in his new , custom-built Italian sports car . They drove slowly through the crowded suburbs of Tunis , then moved onto an open highway , past giant billboards displaying life-sized portraits of the country 's president , and turned off at a dirt road . Passing through peasant villages , the diplomat honked the horn to clear a passage through the crowds of half-naked men , women , and children who crawled out of their huts to stare at the car . The long gleaming hood kept brushing against villagers who failed to jump out of the way in time . In one village , a camel stubbornly blocked the road , and the diplomat was forced to stop . A crowd of onlookers pressed closer to the sleek machine . An old beggar , his hand outstretched , hobbled over to the car on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sores , his trousers were in shreds , his feet bare . One eye was barely visible in a pool of oozing pus . He wore a wreath of fresh lemon-blossoms over his matted gray hair . He brought his face close to the window and fixed his good eye on Levanter . When Levanter made no move to open the window , the beggar began to twitch and placed his gnarled hands on the glass , his crooked fingers crawling over it like leeches . Levanter reached into his pocket for some coins and pressed the window control button on his door , lowering the glass . A hot steaming odor filled the car . Levanter offered the money to the beggar , who jerked his hands off , refusing to take it . The diplomat started to press the button to close the window , but Levanter restrained him.  |p132The  beggar put his head next to Levanter 's . Spittle drooled from his toothless mouth and a dry rattle came from his throat . Finally , in halting French , he managed to say , " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levanter in suspense , waiting for an answer . Levanter nodded ; a smile crossed the man 's face . " When I was young , Cecil Beaton knew me well . He photographed me . He said I was the most beautiful boy he had ever met . " His sighted eye blinked ; he watched Levanter 's face as if expecting some response . Just then the camel moved off the road . Obviously annoyed , the diplomat sent the window the rest of the way up and stepped on the gas . As the car took off , the rear fender grazed the beggar , and he fell to the ground . Back at Levanter 's residence , the diplomat politely escorted Levanterto the door . " Have you had a chance to visit the new baths in Hammamet ? " he asked . Levanter replied that he had n't . " You must . " The diplomat placed his hand on Levanter 's . " There you can enjoy some of the most stunning creatures nature has devised , " he said , lowering his voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He smacked his lips in appreciation . " I 'll be glad to take you there , " he added in a whisper , his fingers pressing Levanter 's wrist . " That 's most kind of you , " said Levanter . " Where do these girls come from ? " The diplomat looked at him with unabashed amazement . " Girls ? " he said , chuckling and patting Levanter 's forearm . " Who mentioned girls ? " He glanced at Levanter as if seeing him for the first time . " My dear George , you are a fetishist , are n't you ? " He was still laughing as he left , calling out , " I guess I 'll see you when we 're both back in New York . " A New York hostess invited Levanter to a party at which the United States Secretary of State and a Soviet poet whom Levanter had known at the university in Moscow were also to be guests . At one point in the evening , Levanter saw the poet talking with the Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet urging the Secretary to do the same . Exchanging watches , the poet explained , was a Russian custom carried out in the spirit of friendship : one man 's watch times his friendship for another . Aware that other guests were watching him , the Secretary , always the consummate negotiator , removed his Tissot and reluctantly gave it to the poet , accepting the poet 's Pobyeda in return . When Levanter returned home from the party , he had hardly walked in the door before the phone rang . It was the Arab diplomat , who was one of the guests , calling on behalf of the hostess . He told Levanter that the wife of the Secretary of State had just called the hostess to say her husband wanted to renegotiate the wristwatch exchange . The hostess did not feel she knew the Soviet poet well enough and had asked if Levanter could tactfully persuadethe poet to take back his generous gesture of friendship . The relative monetary values were apparently not at issue , the hostess assured the diplomat , although the Tissot was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reason the Secretary wanted to retrieve his own watch was that it had been given to him during his youth in Germany , and there was a lot of sentiment attached to it . The next morning , Levanter picked up the Pobyeda and went to see the poet to collect the Tissot . When he explained his mission , the poet went into a rage . He shouted that during his poetryreadingtour in the United States he had traded many Soviet-made Pobyedas for the watches of some very distinguished Americans , many of them Harvard colleagues of the Secretary of State , and no one had ever reneged on the exchange . As evidence , he brought out an impressive collection of Rolexes , Omegas , Pulsars , and Seikos . He plucked the Tissot from the collection and handed it to Levanter . " Who does he think he is ? " the poet ranted in Russian . " Just because he was born in Germany and speaks with a German accent , he does n't have to behave like a German ! " He shouted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it certainly did not mean the victory of pettiness over friendship . The Arab diplomat was relieved and grateful . " This was ap134delicate incident , " he said , " and I knew I could count on you to handle that poet . " He paused . " Although , by coincidence , I learned that the Secretary of State just bought his Tissot on a recent junket to Geneva . " At another time , Levanter was invited to a small dinner party at the New York home of an American businessman and his wife . The guest of honor was Madame Ramoz , wife of the President of the Republic of Deltazur , a small , underdeveloped country of many islands that depended on tourism and American economic and military assistance . Madame Ramoz often represented her husband abroad , and it was said that at home she commanded greater power than all the other government figures put together . Madame Ramoz arrived in the company of several heavily armed bodyguards , who waited outside the apartment during the party , and an aide , a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . She was strikingly elegant , and Levanter was pleased to be seated beside her at dinner . Madame Ramoz explained that she had come to New York on behalf of her husband , the President , to address a Press Club luncheon the following day . American newspapers had been publishing articles and editorials highly critical of the President , she said , reporting that on the pretext of fighting Communist rebels he had established martial law and that he was suppressing political opposition to his dictatorial rule through merciless arrests . As the economy of her country depended on American investments and its safety on American militaryaid , Madame Ramoz admitted one of the main purposes of her visit to the States was to present the truth and to counteract what she termed the antagonistic , Communist-inspired , liberal attacks on her husband , who had made the Republic of Deltazur a bastion of democracy and freedom . Madame Ramoz spoke coolly , charmingly , and Levanter found himself staring at her . She was one of the most beautiful Eurasian women he had ever seen.  |p135When  she finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of American concern over the political situation in her country , the audience at the luncheon would be listening to her speech most attentively . Madame Ramoz told him that she had taken precautions against being misquoted or misrepresented by preparing her speech in advance and providing copies for distributionbefore she spoke . He said he regretted that he was not a member of the Press Club , and asked how he could obtain a copy of her speech . After dinner , Madame Ramoz casually handed Levanter a copy of her prepared text . As she went off to talk with some of the other guests , Levanter quickly read the speech . He waited until Madame Ramoz returned to where he was sitting . " Is this the final text of your speech ? " he asked her . " Yes , " she replied with confidence . " Why do you ask ? " " I 'm afraid there 's a serious error in it . " " An error ? What sort of error ? " " One that might cause you , Madame , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quietly . " However , the error can easily be corrected . " Madame Ramoz looked at him with anxious curiosity . " Tell me about it , " she said . " If I point out the error to you , Madame , will you , in good faith , tell me if you intend to correct it ? " She looked at him intently . " Of course I will . " " Then , " Levanter continued , " if , thanks to me , you recognizeand rectify this error , will you do something for me in return ? " Madame Ramoz gave him a reproachful look . " That depends onwhat you want me to do . " Levanter watched her eyes as he spoke . " Through my role in Investors International , " he said , " I have learned that two prominentreporters for an opposition newspaper in your country have been in prison for months without trial , on vague charges of subver-sion . " She did not react.  | " There was some evidence of torture , " he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from an error in your speech , will you intervene on their behalf ? " Madame Ramoz looked away , toward the handsome colonel , who stood across the room watching . Then her gaze moved back to Levanter . " I am merely the wife of the President , Mr. Levanter , but I promise to use whatever limited influence I have on the Ministry of the Interior . Now tell me about this error . " Levanter opened the speech to a page with a bent corner and indicated a passage he had marked with pencil . He moved closer to Madame Ramoz so she could read it with him . " And so my husband , the President , ' he read , " took upon himself the arduous task of hatchet man to his country . ' He paused . " As it stands now , " he said softly , " this passage suggests that President Ramoz became a vicious killer . " Madame Ramoz stiffened . Leaning over Levanter 's arm , she examined the text closely . " Surely you did n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that Mr. President took upon himself the task of trailblazer for his people . " " But of course , " exclaimed Madame Ramoz . " Everyone who has known and loved him through all these difficult years knows that ! The speech was originally written in our language , " she said . " The error must have been made when it was translated into English . I will make the correction . Thank you for your assistance to me and the President . " " Then I have been of some help , after all ? " " Yes , you have , " she said . " Now , who are these two supposedly innocent reporters ? " Levanter scribbled the names on the back of his calling card and handed the card to Madame Ramoz , who took it and held her hand out . The colonel strode over from across the room and , bowing , took the card from her . The two reporters were released from prison soon after Madame Ramoz 's return to her country . Presumably under instructions from their government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dropped and they were reunited with their families . A subsequent inquiry by Investors Internationalconfirmed that they were free . Levanter had nearly forgotten about the incident when one day , some months later , a middle-aged , poorly dressed , Eurasianlookingwoman stopped him as he was leaving the Investors **25;4021;TOOLONG . " Are you George Levanter ? " she asked , shaking . " I am . " The short woman edged closer . Her hair was matted and smelledof grease . " If I could , I would kill you , " she stammered , her facepale and her movements jittery . " I swear I would , " she whispered . Levanter was startled . " Why ? What have I done to you ? " " You have put my brother in prison , " she snapped . " He wastortured . " Her face twitched and she started to cry . " You 're wrong , " said Levanter . " I have never put anyone in prison . " The woman grabbed his arm . " But you work for that bitch , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The woman spat up at him . Her saliva dribbled down his chin , but Levanter did not move . " You 're wrong , " he said slowly . " Utterly wrong . I merely pleaded with Madame Ramoz to set two men free . Nothing else , I assure you . " The woman looked up at him . " My brother was a translator . Now he 's imprisoned for sabotage , kept in a safe house , ' the government interrogation center . They put him on cushions of air '  --  his feet on one bed , his head on another , his body suspended in midair . And whenever he dropped , they gave him ' falanga '  --  beating on the soles of the feet . The person who wrote to me about him learned from someone in the Palace Guards that it was George Levanter , from Investors International , who denounced my brother to the Ramoz woman at a party in New York . "  |p138Levanter  was driving from Switzerland to France . He passed the Swiss border guards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highway separating the two borders . It was there that he saw a young woman standing next to a car , its hood open , its emergency lights flashing . She wore a tapered T-shirt with FOXY LADY printed in large block letters across the front and back . He pulled up beside her and asked whether she needed any help . She said she was waiting for a mechanic and needed only someone to wait with her . She told him she was from the Middle East but had gone to school in the States and now lived in New York . Levanter remarked that anyone would assume she was an American . She wore skin-tight jeans and had thick black hair , evenly cut to shoulder length . Her make-up had been applied with such skill and care that her complexion appeared quite natural even in the glaring sunlight . Her T-shirt displayed a smooth neck and large breasts . She had a slim waist , gently rounded hips without a fold of fat , and long , slender legs with small , narrow feet ; and she carried herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocative . On both sides of no man 's land , customs inspectors and border guards were eyeing her with delight.  |p139As  Levanter chatted with Foxy Lady , the Swiss mechanic finally arrived . He took one look at the car 's engine and announced that he could not fix it on the spot . He hitched it up to tow it to his garage in the small border town . Levanter turned his car around and , accompanied by the friendly cheers of the border guards , followed with Foxy Lady in his car . He invited her to have lunch with him while she waited for her car . As they ate , she mentioned that she had just come from a Swiss clinic . The second time the clinic came up in their conversation , Levanter asked her why she had been there . At first she hesitated ; then she said she had just undergone surgery for the removal of a tumor in her uterus . Her lids shyly lowered to half cover her eyes as she explained that , even though the tumor was not malignant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to be restricted for some time . Levanter found her frankness enticing . The mechanic was unable to repair the car before the garage closed . Levanter assured Foxy Lady that his business in Paris could wait and offered to keep her company . They took adjoining rooms in a motel . That evening they were the only dinner guests in the motel 's restaurant , and the manager , a hospitable , elderly Swiss woman , treated them to a rare white wine . This wine , the woman explained , was made of grapes from the vineyards high in the glacial region of the Alps . The vines had been planted centuries ago by religious sects that had settled among the inaccessible peaks to escape persecution . She offered the glacier wine , she said , in honor of the beauty of Foxy Lady . She stared at her , repeating again and again that many chic people passed through this border area , yet she had never seen such a beautiful woman . Foxy Lady appeared to be excited by the compliments . Her cheeks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quivered . As the woman spoke , Foxy Lady nudged Levanter under the table with her foot . Gently , she pushed his legs apart and he felt her toes on his calves . After dinner he and Foxy Lady retired to their rooms . Later , Levanter knocked on her door to say good night , expecting to find her ready for bed . Instead , she was dressed , her makeupfresh and immaculate . He assumed that she wanted to go outp140again . But when he said that the motel bar was still open , she said she wanted them to stay in her room to get to know each other better . She surveyed herself in the mirror and hastily adjusted her clothes . She looked at Levanter with her expressive , shiny eyes ; then she came to him and very softly began to stroke his hair . She kissed him , nibbling his neck , her tongue plunging into his ear . She pressed her breasts against him , then quickly unbuttoned his shirt and started to kiss his chest , her tongue caressing his nipples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aroused but he pulled away , afraid he might hurt her . She pouted . He explained that he was concerned about her operation . Without a word , she began to undress , scattering her clothes and sandals around the floor with abandon . Her breasts were full and firm with small aureoles and short nipples . As if to tease him , she paused before removing her panties . Then she slipped them off and moved toward Levanter , exposing her flesh and a pad of white gauze , the final remnant of her visit to the clinic . She lay down on the bed and reached for him . In her lovemaking that night , she was very inventive , eager to compensate for the part of her body that still had to remain dormant . They returned to New York together . Foxy Lady adored dancing . Each time she entered a new nightclub or disco , she told Levanter , she felt as if she were on a high diving board , about to take her first jump before a crowd of spectators . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to introduce Foxy Lady to the best dancer in the place . She would always select the table that gave her the best view of the floor and offered others the best view of her . Then she and Levanter would screen the dancing couples , looking for a partner who could keep up with her frenetic energy without trying to upstage her . When the two of them had agreed on which man qualified as a candidate , Levanter took Foxy Lady to the floor . There , in the first few steps , they would veer toward the unsuspecting couple , making certain that the candidate could get a good look at Foxy Lady . Once he began to stare at her , Foxy Ladyp141knew she had him . Feigning clumsiness , she would bump into the man and his partner . Levanter always promptly apologized , but in the process made sure to introduce himself and Foxy Lady , casually remarking that , after his mishap , he was through dancing for the night . Amicably , he proposed to Foxy Lady that if she wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would chat with the couple until they volunteered to join him and Foxy Lady at their table . Soon the candidate would ask Foxy Lady to dance . Within minutes , she and her new partner were the center of attention . After each high-diving-board evening , Levanter and Foxy Lady returned to their hotel suite . For Foxy Lady the night had not yet ended . In the nightclub she had once again proved to Levanter that the world was in love with her ; now she needed proof from him that he was completely hooked on her . Still elated , she would reach for the glacier wine to which she had become almost addicted and which he had taken great trouble to procure for her . She quickly bathed , and came to Levanter radiant . She would stand before him , slowly exposing her body , which she knew mesmerized him . It was a perfect , sculptured body zealously cared for each day by experts , its hairless skin glowing without a blemish , its muscles tightened and toned by the experienced hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down through the peaks of frenzy , was to Foxy Lady a final tribute to her own beauty . Every time Levanter returned from a short business trip out of town , Foxy Lady would tell him , with her accustomed candor , what she had done in his absence . As if to remind him of her desirability to others , she related in great detail descriptions of evenings spent in male company while he was away . There were other times , she said , when she wanted to be among women , who found her as beautiful and desirable as men did . For many , she became their first female lover . Foxy Lady would spin out the stories of her encounters one after another and Levanter would listen , trying not to feel threatened by her erotic exploits with others . He recognized that this was thep142stuff of her life : she was just as beautiful for everyone else as she was for him . To appreciate her beauty did not require special taste or unusual insight . Thus , his own desire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another man , who might at any time replace him . Levanter could no more ponder what her loss would mean to him than he could imagine ever possessing her entirely . He could think of her current lover as a rival , he could be jealous of two or three of her intimate friends , but how could he be envious of that stranger whom Foxy Lady had not yet met ? He knew that in the constellation of her erotic adventures he was one of many stars . For her , dancing and sex were her only means of making contact with other people , just as caring for her body and her appearance constituted her only sense of herself . To be seen , to please and dazzle with her looks were her only motives . She hated any activity that required being alone ; but she would rather not go out at all than go out and not be noticed and admired . When she saw someone 's eyes resting upon her , she seemed to come to life as if she were being touched by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself as the source of Levanter 's desire , she willingly gave herself to him ; she submitted to pain , if inflicting pain was what he needed to make him feel he finally possessed her . But as soon as he was about to give in to the release of his own excitement , she regained control over him ; then it was she who was the instrument of his satiation and he who was her slave . He felt possessive of her beauty ; still her sexuality was ambiguous to him . He could not pin down exactly what she wanted from their lovemaking , yet she seemed to understand everything he wanted . Whereas other women had at times responded as if his urgings were odd , she accepted his needs as if they were to be expected . She seemed to be proud of her ability to bring out all his secret lusts and longings . In a sensual vigil over his flesh , she monitored every detail of his release , anxious to know the duration and intensity of each spasm . In an effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to capture her expressions , her gestures , her smiles.  |p143As  the stack of prints grew , he would look at them , one after another , secretly hoping to discover in her looks what it was that both held and disturbed him . But just as the photographs failed to reveal her to him , they offered no insight into his compulsion . He started to photograph her on transparencies . The slides would rotate in the projector and , as images of Foxy Lady flashed on his portable screen , he felt as if the beauty they conveyed was coming from someplace in his brain , imprinted by an artist who chose to remain unidentified . He had known her for only a relatively short time , and whenever he mentioned his concerns about her sexuality , Foxy Lady answeredthat the tumor surgery had traumatized her body , upset her menstrual rhythm , and threatened to make her barren . Her body had not yet healed , and she had to have weekly examinations and injections . Midway between medical appointments , she grew depressedand unsure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident . He had no reason to think that she fabricated the stories of her adventures , but he did suspect that what she knew about her own sexual life was incomplete , and perhaps unconsciously falsified . He had also developed a conviction that she was not truthful about the nature of her orgasms with him , that , at times , she claimed to have had them when she had not . He took this to be the aftermath of her operation ; to him , she still remained sealed by gauze , and he kept wanting more of her . The time they spent together seemed to expand his life , the time away from her to shrink it . Foxy Lady became his habit . Levanter returned from one of his trips two days earlier than he had planned . It was late ; Foxy Lady was not in their suite . He felt restless and went to the hotel lobby to buy the next day 's morning paper . On the off chance that he could find Foxy Lady , he asked the doorman whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that , as it was raining and there were no cabs , the young lady had left in the hotel limousine about two hours earlier . Levanter said he was supposed to join her but had lost the address of the place where they were to meet and asked for the same car.  |p144The  hotel driver took him straight to the club where , he said , he had dropped the young lady . Levanter had never been to that club . He opened the door and was scrutinized by a young , tough-looking bouncer . As he went through the crowded entrance hall on his way to the cloakroom , Levanter was greeted by a young woman in a short leather skirt with tight laces along the sides . Her eyebrows were plucked to fine lines and she pushed out her chest to show off the shapely breasts beneath her flimsy chiffon blouse . " I know you , " she said in a low , well-modulated voice . " I saw you once at a disco . You were with my friend . " " Your friend ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing with her that night and a couple bumped into you two on the dance floor . My friend told me you call her Foxy Lady . She 's here tonight , you know . " " I know , " said Levanter . " I 've come to join her . " He checked his coat and started walking along the corridor to the rooms that opened in the rear . The young woman strutted beside him on her high heels , clearly determined to keep him company . " She told me how the two of you met in Europe , " she whispered . " Between two countries . Very romantic . Like in an old Garbo movie . " The woman was so close he could smell her heavy perfume , and she brushed against him with her hips . " You were her first man , you know . " " Her first man ? Could n't be ! " Levanter exclaimed . " Yes . Her first man after the change ! " " After what ? " " You know after what . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The girl squeezed his arm . She laughed , covering her mouth with her delicate hand . " That 's a good one . I like what you call it : her tumor ' ! " She batted her long eyelashes , flipping her hair off her cheeks and shoulders . Levanter was annoyed . " And what do you call it ? " he asked . She just laughed . She took his hand and , guiding it , she pressedp145it under her skirt , pushing hard until she was sure he felt what she wanted him to feel . " I 'll call it whatever you want to call it , lover , " she said in a throaty whisper . " Soon I 'm going to have my tumor ' removed too , you know ! Why do n't you look me up sometime ? " Levanter pulled his hand out from under the skirt and walked toward the sound of dance music . In an instant , the entire length of his relationship with Foxy Lady coursed through his mind ; his infatuation with her physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt ashamed of what he had done with her in their lovemaking . He could n't help imagining how she thought of him . Levanter was no longer simply the lover of a beautiful and mysteriouswoman . Rather , he was a sexually spoiled partner demanding easy gratification from another man , a man who had all along understood his needs so well and satisfied him so easily . Levanter looked around . Many of the women were beautiful , though none was as striking as Foxy Lady . Now that he knew who they all were , he felt cheated . Foxy Lady was dancing . When she saw Levanter , she stopped abruptly and pushed away from her partner , a tall , muscular man . Out of breath , her hair mussed , she ran to Levanter , kissed him , and took him aside . " How did you find me ? " Foxy Lady asked him in a hushed voice . " The hotel driver brought me here . " " I saw you talking to my friend . " " Yes . She told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So she told you . Now you know , " she said . " Yes , I know , " said Levanter , " about your tumor . ' " " It wo n't make any difference , will it ? We will stay together , wo n't we ? " she asked , looking at him anxiously . " We wo n't , " said Levanter . " I must leave you . " Foxy Lady pleaded . " You have n't given me enough of a chance . I do n't even know myself yet . In a week my gauze will be removed , " she said . " You wo n't be able to tell the difference be/tween me and any other woman . " She paused . " I 'll be the only woman you 've ever known who gets her orgasm entirely from inside , " she joked . " I was hooked on the mystery of you , " he said . " And now it has been solved . " " But I have n't cheated you . No woman could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want me to have a baby . " She looked at him attentively , then gently steered him to another corridor . Muted voices came from above a staircase . She stopped him before they reached it . " As a child , I knew nature had made a mistake , " she said . " I felt I was beginning to look like a girl and to be driven by needs I did not understand . By the time I was twelve , I would spend at least a few minutes each day in front of my mirror dressing up in girls ' clothes or putting on make-up or a wig . I wondered about altering my sex . But in a Moslem country women are owned like animals . " She laughed bitterly . " It 's bad enough to be born a female . It 's utterly unthinkable for a sane male ever to change into one . " Foxy Lady led Levanter over to a bench and urged him to sit down beside her . She took a deep breath . " My family , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most influential in our country , and my father was a distinguished diplomat . As his only son , I was my father 's pride , and the sole successor to his wealth . " She thought a moment , then spoke in a detached voice . " When I was about sixteen , my father became alarmed as he realized I was losing my masculinity , so he summoneda team of French doctors , who spent weeks injecting me with male hormones . But Allah was not to be bested . " Levanter touched her hand , thinking how delicate and feminine it looked . She kept on as if nothing could stop her tale now that she had finally begun it . " Despite these treatments , my breasts grew , as my body seemed to be insisting I was a woman . I felt there was no one I could turn to . My mother had died when I was small , and I had never felt close to either the young woman my father married soon after or their two daughters . Thus , I was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later did I realize why she did it . " Levanter looked at her questioningly . " I was still the only legitimate successor to my father 's wealth , " Foxy Lady explained . " She had not borne my father a son , but here was her chance to get rid of the only obstacle between herself and her daughters and a vast inheritance . While I was studying in America , my stepmother came to see me and secretly arranged for me to see an American doctor who specialized in transsexuals . He suggested psychological therapy to prepare me for an operation  --  and for life as a woman . Of course , he did n't know I was already preparing myself by coming here , or going to other clubs like this , every evening . Without my father 's knowledge , my stepmother transferred a substantial amount of money to my Swiss bank account . I went through the psychotherapy and hormone injections , and soon I was ready to go to Switzerland for the final transforma-tion . " She gazed at Levanter . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still in the clinic , an anonymous caller , no doubt hired by my stepmother , told my father that I had been disfigured in an accident . Within hours , he was at my side , anxious about my injuries . The doctor lifted the covers and told him proudly that the surgery was successful , his son was now a woman . My father ran out of the room , screaming that he had no son . " She paused , as if to swallow the pain in her voice . " Before I left the clinic , an embassy clerk came as an emissary from my father to tell me that I was to be prevented from discrediting my father , his family , and his post in the service of the King . My passport was no longer valid ; I had no further right to use the family name , for my father said his son was irretrievably lost . The emissary informed me that my father had secured testimony from various medical authorities to have me declared insane . If I ever returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental defective and dumped into a mental asylum . And if ever , anywhere in the world , I publicly reveal who my father is , his men will make certain that I wo n't live to slander him again . " It was clear to Levanter that she did not doubt her father 's threat.  | " My banks immediately informed me  --  " Foxy Lady stopped , then began again . " The day I met you , in fact , my banks had just notified me that I was deemed legally unfit to be responsible for my share of the family 's oil revenue left to me by my grandfather , all my foreign and domestic bank accounts were closed , my weekly allowance was stopped , and all my savings and income reverted to my father . " She touched Levanter 's arm and looked up at him . Her eyes were as sad as her voice . " That 's how it all happened , " she said , sounding as if her story were as much of a shock to her as it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation was complete : Once a man , I was now a woman . Once rich , I was rich no more . Along with my manhood , I had lost both my father and my country . I had become a vagrant whose residence in any nation is secure only as long as I can support myself and pay for the medical treatments that I continually need . " A good-looking young woman , slender and long-legged , her breasts set high on her chest , walked toward them . Foxy Lady stood up , and they greeted each other with a kiss . Levanter rose , and Foxy Lady introduced him to the other woman , who gave him a whimsical , teasing smile and walked away , swinging her hips . Levanter glanced at Foxy Lady . He was crushed to think of the hopelessness of her condition , yet he knew that at this moment he must consider only himself . " Same breed ! " Foxy Lady exclaimed when the woman was out of earshot . " I do n't think there is a God-made woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a big city bank . " She laughed . " Half the time behind the counter , a man in a business suit . Nobodyin the bank knew about the other half of his time , spent as a grand lady here . Finally he left the bank , took hormones , grew breasts and long hair . All the lady needs now is a bank loan for her final cut . And they say only secret agents live in disguise ! " She saw that Levanter was looking around , making no effort to hide his discomfort . " We think of ourselves as ideal lovers , " said Foxy Lady , " eachp149one a sum of passions both of a man and of a woman . But in fact , all we combine are the vanities of both . After all , if not the vanity , what else could sustain us , except maybe the fun . All kinds of things happen here , " she said . " Occasionally , an unsuspecting out-oftownerdrifts in , thinking he 's showing his wife the big city . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and there they 'll all be  --  a troop of man-made women in high heels , skirts hitched up at a row of wall urinals , or comparing breasts , cosmetics , fancy stockings , and , reluctantly , their not-so-atrophied tumors . ' The out-of-town lady takes one look at them and , shocked out of her skull , rushes away as fast as she can . Meanwhile , at the bar , her all-American husband is being conned by a young thing showing off her brandnewboobs . " She paused . Then she moved toward Levanter , nuzzling his neck , kissing his cheeks and eyes . " During those in-between years , " she said , " whenever a man or a woman made love to me I kept wondering whether I was wanted as a woman or as a man . Or was I merely being used to help other people make up their minds ? Even when I knew my lover wanted the woman in me , the male part of me stood in the way , denying who I was and mocking what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dead end and I took it . " She stopped again . Upstairs a glass crashed to the floor . The voices rose , then quieted again . " You , George , were the first straight man who knew me only as a complete woman . I was a virgin with you , " she said . " When you first came to me in that no man 's land , you personified the whole of manhood which I had cut myself off from forever . You were the challenge I had to meet from then on . " She looked at him . Levanter saw once again how beautiful she was , the skin on her face radiating light ; her eyes , like her hair , appeared jet black ; her breasts felt firm against him . He put his arms around her , but for the first time he felt no desire to touch and possess her . It was strange not to want the body that he had enjoyed for so long , but Foxy Lady now seemed incapable ofp150providing him with the view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her . " I do wish you would stay with me , " Foxy Lady whispered . " Even if I did n't tell you the whole truth , I did n't lie to you . And , after all , what 's important in sex is to be excited and to stay excited  --  to be yourself . With you I always am . " Levanter felt the warmth of her breath on his neck . He was silent for another moment . Then he asked , " What will happen to you now ? " She disengaged herself and pulled him toward the staircase . " Come upstairs with me . " They entered a large , dimly lit room . Several waiters , young effeminate men in white sailor uniforms , navigated between the tables carrying trays of drinks . Dense smoke from tobacco , hashish , and marijuana filled the air . Levanter noticed that most of the tables were occupied by older women dressed in gaudy gowns , or leather jackets and short skirts , with black silk stockings suspended from satin garter straps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customersalso seemed old . Many of the people in the room already appeared to be in a state of drunken or drugged dreaminess , preventedfrom falling asleep by the loud music blasting from two corner speakers . Foxy Lady pulled Levanter into the room . Several women looked up , arching their plucked-out , penciled-in eyebrows . They called to Foxy Lady , admiring her dress and hairdo but paying no attention to Levanter . In the hazy light of the room , the women seemed old . Yet when he looked into their faces , he discovered they were barely middleaged . No joy showed in their eyes . Under the thick make-up , their skin was coarse and wrinkled , their dyed hair was thin and scanty with balding patches , which some tried to cover with wigs . Almost all of them were obese , with fleshy necks , fatty shoulders , shapeless thighs and overdeveloped calves . Their artificially overblown breasts had become soft , and flapped like pancakes on their barrel chests . Their hands , covered with brown spots , were unnaturallyp151broad , nearly square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed uniformly thick . Slowly , Levanter turned and left the room . Foxy Lady followed . " That 's what we call the Menopause Room , " she said . " It 's where we pause after being men  --  the only menopause we get . And those are some members of our self-made generation , " she said , forcing a matter-of-fact tone . " Hormonal imbalance . Metabolic disorders . Mental impairment . No sex drive . And no money for doctors or a decent life . Sleeping most of the day in their cold-water flats , drinking most of the night here to wash down an endless supply of uppers and downers . Their only salvation is that the club owner remembers them as foxy ladies , young and fresh and lovely , and gives them dinner every night without charge . Then , of course , " said Foxy Lady , " in a country as large as this , there are still some customers willing to go on a blind date with them . " They went downstairs again . As she was helping him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloakroom leering at her . She saw them too . " Let them look , " she said . " They 've known all along what you 've learned only tonight . They want me , yet they think I 've made the worst sacrifice a man can make . And for what ? For no more than a short appearance just for them . Until I end up upstairs too ! " Alone , missing the company of Foxy Lady , Levanter turned for company to his old friends . JP was one of them . In the world of sport , JP was a legendary figure . Three-time world fencing champion , Olympic gold medalist , winner of scores of other international meets , JP ranked as the greatest saber fencer of all time . As was customary for star athletes in Eastern Europe , JP was given the pro forma rank of lieutenant colonel in the army and assigned to a Ministry of National Defense troop-training program.  |p152He  had come to a competition in New York and invited Levanter to his hotel room . JP sighed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials had proposed that he act as military attache in his country 's Brussels embassy , using his social and sporting connections in Western Europe to penetrate the high command of NATO . " They want me to become a spy for the Warsaw Pact military forces , " JP said . Levanter was astounded . " When they first spelled it out to me , " said JP , " my mouth went dry . I could n't say a word . " He stopped for a moment . " Fencing is my whole life , you know that . The saber is the national symbol of my country , and at home I am a hero to every man , woman , and child , a source of national pride . Why is n't that enough ? " " What did you say to them ? " Levanter asked . " I said I only know how to fight in the open . Then a general present at the meeting shouted that I would be ideal for the job because in the West they worship me so much they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General , ' I said . I 'm a fencer . If they worship me , it 's because they do watch my hands . ' And I stormed out of the interview . " " What happened then ? " " Nothing at first . Then my address books and notebooks would disappear for a while , only to turn up later in places I would never have put them . Some of my friends were interrogated . One time I was fined a third of my salary for arriving late at a training session . " He laughed bitterly . " As there 's no one better  --  or even as good as I am  --  for a sparring partner , I fence against my own reflection in a specially constructed triple mirror . And several times they fined me for being late to train against myself ! " JP stood up and walked across the room . " Then this , " he said , taking a book from the top of a bureau , " was the biggest blow . And it happened right before I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levanter . It was a copy of The Olympic Gold , his newly published autobiography.  | " Fresh from the State Publishing House , " he said wistfully . " Delivered to me just as I was boarding the plane to New York . " He paused , obviously upset . " Without my knowledge , unidentifiedstate censors have deleted many passages from the book and seriously altered many others . The name of my fencing coach , whom I had mentioned dozens of times , now does n't appear even once . The man taught me all I know . I guess they took him out because he 's Jewish , " JP said . " Things have been added also  --  attacks on high military and sports officials , dragging me into their political infighting . " Anxious to help JP , Levanter called on his friend , the Arab diplomat . " What would you like me to do ? " the diplomat asked . Levanter did not hesitate . " Can you find out whether JP will be in danger if he returns home ? " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet him at a men 's public baths in mid-Manhattan . At first he was surprised that the Arab would choose such a place . But once he was inside , it occurred to him that the diplomat probably frequented such establishments for sexual purposes , and possibly used them for the privacy they afforded for secret political activities . Wrapped in towels , they walked along the dark corridor without speaking . Music seemed to flow from every corner  --  slow and sentimental , it combined with the dim light and the scent of marijuana to create a sense of insistent intimacy . The doors to most of the rooms they went past were open ; inside each room , under weak blue lights , lay naked men , some sleeping , some posing , some sniffing drugs from small atomizers , and others blatantly gesturing to them to enter . They went downstairs , passing a large showerand-bathroom , with large bottles of red mouthwash and stacks of paper cups piled high over each sink . A younger man approached from the opposite direction , and just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched the diplomat 's groin . The Arab patted the young man 's cheek . " Not now , not now , " he said . Smiling , the young man walked away.  | " It 's too bad , " said the diplomat , " that you Westerners , when pressed by desire , rely on the gesture . In my culture , men first talk about their sexual wants in great detail ; words carry no shame . You must visit us sometime , " he said to Levanter as the two of them entered the dormitory , a large room with dozens of cots . Men cruised the aisles , watching each other , their limbs posed as invitingly as their faces might be in ordinary daytime encounters . Every now and then , one would edge closer to another , seeking the other 's flesh , first with his hand , then with his mouth . In the far corner of the room , two naked men lay in a tight embrace . There , sitting together on a cot , in the eerie light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hum of whispers and sighs , Levanterand the diplomat discussed JP 's fate . The diplomat told Levanter that JP had voiced his opposition to certain methods of troop training adopted by the military , claiming they were too harsh and inhuman . Because of his status as a national hero , his views attracted many supporters . The Party , fearing the growing role of the military , was clearly setting the stage for JP 's arrest . Consequently , the diplomat told Levanter in hushed tones , East European intelligence agents were spreading rumors in Western sports circles that the fencer was a member of a gold-and-antiques smuggling ring . And more recently they seemed to be working up a charge of Zionist conspiracy . The diplomat also explained that several hotels in Paris , London , and New York were indirectly owned or controlled by East Europeanstate security agencies . Certain suites reserved for important guests were equipped with sophisticated monitoring devices so that the authorities could keep track of the activities and contacts of traveling officials , scientists , sports stars , actors , and writers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , their trips abroad served not only as a reward for loyalty to the state but also as a further test of this loyalty . It was from the New York hotel where JP often stayed that his government had obtained the most incriminating evidence against the fencer , the Arab diplomat said . They had complete recordings of all JP 's conversations with his Western friends , including onep155with the man they considered an open enemy of their state : George Levanter . The diplomat strongly advised that JP not go home . Whenever the state went to such lengths to find evidence to incriminate a man , he said , it always found that evidence without difficulty . In fact , JP 's government had already prepared its lists of national world sports record holders for distribution at the forthcoming World Championships  --  and JP 's name was not on it . Levanter wasted no time . He had JP meet him in a park near his hotel . When JP heard what Levanter had learned from the diplomat , he appeared stunned . JP thought for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Of all people , why a national hero ? " " You must not go back , " said Levanter . " You belong to fencing , not to the government . Stay in America . Fence here . Teach fencing . Write . " JP reflected . " I never considered defecting , " he said . " I belong to my nation ; my saber helps shape my people 's national pride . Everybody in the government knows that . They ca n't touch me . I am going back . " Some weeks later , the Arab diplomat got in touch with Levanter to give him the news about JP . As the fencer stepped off the plane from New York , he had been arrested and held incommunicado in a military fortress . For a while there was silence about his fate . Then the first ominous sign appeared . In one of the country 's official publications , a well-known Party hack published a cartoon showing JP as a hooded , trench-coated , saber-rattling spy , superimposed on a graph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a ball . The word was soon out that JP had refused to cooperate and play into the hands of his accusers . With some sense of relief , Levanter reflected that in a small country of soulless bureaucrats , no secret can be kept , not even in a fortress . From various leaks and rumors , the following picture of JP 's interrogation had reached Western intelligence : JP had been seatedp156in a chair in a large , stark room , the diplomat told Levanter , and had been grilled under glaring lights . After a long session of loaded questions clearly designed to wear him down , the fencer had pointed to his arm and shouted , " You ca n't destroy what this arm stands for . It belongs to the people ! " The officer in charge got up from behind his desk and entered the circle of light to stand behind the fencer . " Is this the arm you speak of ? " he asked calmly , tapping JP 's right shoulder . JP swung around in his chair to face him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , extending it with pride . The officer looked at the outstretched arm . Swiftly he grabbed it with both hands and , putting all his weight on one leg , pushed the chair away with the other . Like a peasant breaking a twig in two , the colonel bent the fencer 's arm over the back of the chair , then pressed down . The elbow snapped with a loud crack , and the arm went limp . JP howled and tried to pull free , but the colonel twisted the broken arm sideways and brought the wrist down over the back of the chair . Now the wrist cracked , and the hand went as limp as the arm . Moaning , JP slid from the chair onto the floor . " So much for the arm of the people , " said the colonel , returning to his desk . A military tribunal , meeting in closed session , decided to deprive JP of property and all civilian rights for life as punishment for acting against the highest interests of the state . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison . Levanter was filled with outrage . Twenty-five years for JP the fencer , he thought , while most of the leaders of the Third Reich received shorter sentences from the international tribunal at Nuremberg . He determined to conduct a systematic survey of the hotel in New York where JP had stayed . With the diplomat 's aid , he obtained a long list of JP 's compatriotswho had been booked into the same hotel and were punished when they returned home : a novelist who failed to recount his meeting with an American intellectual had his forthcoming book withdrawn before publication ; an actress who saw her uncle in Newp157York but had never admitted having a relative in the United States was not allowed to travel abroad again ; an architect who overlooked mentioning a professional fee he had received from his American colleagues for an industrial design was assigned to work on collectiveprojects only . There were dozens of other such victims . Several times , under different names and wearing various disguises , Levanter rented rooms in the hotel . He was looking for surveillance devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel employees responsible for selecting and assigning the rooms , he narrowed his search to a senior clerk , the man in charge of booking visitors from Eastern Europe . The clerk , Levanter learned , had worked in the hotel for over ten years . After observing him for some time at his job , Levanter followed him one evening to his house in the suburbs . Then , when the man and his wife went away for a weekend , he broke into their home and found a large basement workshop filled with electronic equipment . Several of the components matched those Levanter had discovered in the hotel suites regularly assigned to guests from behind the Iron Curtain . Levanter checked with the Arab diplomat , who confirmed a few days later that , according to his sources , there were sufficient indications that the senior clerk was one of the minor East Europeanoperatives active in North America . Levanter telephoned the man at the hotel one morning and , in a rehearsed stutter intended to make his speech unforgettable , introduced himself as a well-to-do retired businessman from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clerk 's name from a travel agency whose clientele included many East Europeans . He was concerned about the fate of certain men and women from behind the Iron Curtain , he said , some of whom might wish to defect to the United States . He pointed out that these visitors were often advanced in age and not fluent in English , and that they might therefore hesitate to take such a decisive step without aid and encouragement . Levanter explained that several freedom-minded American businessmen  --  he mentioned half a dozen names thep158clerk would be sure to recognize  --  had just established a special tax-deductible fund for long-range assistance to potential defectors . He and his associates needed someone trustworthy and knowledgeableto cooperate with them ; for obvious reasons it could n't be anyone too visible who might put such a clandestine human-rights project in jeopardy . Would the clerk be interested in helping them ? Or did he know of anyone who might ? There would be substantial remuneration for any professional risk incurred , and financial arrangementscould certainly be worked out to their mutual satisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levanter to discuss the matter further . Levanter apologized for not having a private club in New York where he could take his guest , but said he had thought of a convenientspot where they could meet privately . Besides , he said , he had a bad lower back and needed a sauna . Could they , therefore , meet at the Cavalier Baths , in midtown , where they could enjoy a measureof seclusion and anonymity ? As he had to fly home the next morning , Levanter said , he hoped the clerk could meet him that day , perhaps after lunch , when the baths would not be crowded . The clerk eagerly agreed , and Levanter , who remembered the layout of the baths from his previous meeting there , outlined a plan . To save them both time and insure that they did not miss each other , he suggested , the clerk should rent a room at the baths , prepare himself for a sauna , and then come to the room Levanter had reserved , number lot . Then they could proceed together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just two hours to prepare himself for the meeting . He put on a pair of chamois gloves and picked up a saber he had bought some weeks earlier and a heavy household hammer with a thick leather protective cap over the iron head . Wrapping each in a woolen scarf , he put them into a strong shopping bag , added a coil of rope , took off the gloves , and threw them into the bag . In the strong light of his bathroom , he carefully fitted a gray theatrical wig over his hair and glued on false eyebrows , a mustache , and a short beard . In minutes , he had become unrecognizable.  |p159He  left his building through the service entrance , hailed a taxi , and arrived at the baths , his raincoat draped casually over the shopping bag . He approached the cashier , a sleepy old man with a sallow complexion and puffy cheeks , and , in a low voice , said he had reserved room tot . Scarcely raising his eyes from his newspaper , the cashier handed Levanter a bracelet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of the room covered twelve hours of rental time . Room lot was located upstairs , at the farthest end of the corridor , next to the central air-conditioning unit , which was so noisy that Levanter was sure that anyone cruising the corridor would turn back before reaching the end . Levanter put on his gloves before opening the door and then locking it behind him . Lit only by one dim bulb , which barely dispelled the darkness , the room contained a wooden bunk with a mattress , a sheet and two pillows , a chair , a locker , and one small bed table . Levanter slipped the saber under the bunk and put the hammer on the table . He undressed , hanging his clothes in the metal locker next to the bunk , taking off the gloves only after unlocking the door . Then , wrapped in a towel , he went downstairs , leaving the door slightly ajar . He sat in the area where customers came to cool off after the sauna . From here he could watch the main entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and rented a room . Levanter went upstairs after him and returned to tot . He hid his room key in his raincoat pocket and put on the gloves , then lay on the bunk , listening to the music from the corridor . In a few minutes there was a gentle knock at the door . Levanter rose , picked up the hammer with his right hand , and , holding it behind his back , opened the door with his left hand . Stuttering , he greeted the clerk and invited him in . The clerk seemed uncertain , self-conscious , and timid in his towel , and said he would rather wait in one of the lounges downstairs . Levanter explained that he had just come up ; there were too many unsavory types downstairs , he said , old men openly trading pep pills andp160snorting coke . He himself , he added , did not like to be exposed to such goings-on , but if the clerk was interested , he was certainly free to go . That remark did the trick . The clerk denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garland floated in from the corridor speaker , he fumbled in the semidarkness to the chair beside the bunk . Levanter pushed the door closed with his left hand while with his right he hit the man 's head with the leather-covered hammer . Stunned , the man slumped , his towel fell off , and he collapsed onto the edge of the bunk . Levanter grabbed him by the legs and lifted his entire length onto the mattress . He pried the man 's mouth open and gagged him with a towel , then removed his room-key bracelet and put it on his own wrist . He turned the body face-down and , twisting the rope around the man 's neck , waist , knees , and ankles , he tied it securely around the length of the bunk . Levanter dressed carefully , making sure that he forgot nothing . He put on his raincoat , wrapped the hammer in the scarf , and placed it in the shopping bag . He bent over the clerk and pinched him : a shudder ran through the man 's trunk ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter a sound . Levanter reminded himself that what he was about to carry out was impersonal revenge , as simple as the verdict of a military tribunal . He slid the saber from beneath the bed . Weapon in hand , its polished blade glistening in the blue light , Levanter stood at the foot of the bunk . He reached over the naked man and brought the tip of the saber to the narrow passage that , like a shadow , divided the man 's rump . He inched the end of the sword down the passage , until its tip touched the larger opening in the flesh . Levanter leaned over ; supporting himself with one hand , he thrust forward and , as if sheathing the weapon , plunged the blade deep into the opening . An intense spasm convulsed the body , followed by a shudder . When the entire blade had penetrated , the corpse lay motionless . Levanter covered it with the sheet . He turned off the light and pulled the door tightly shut as he left the room . He put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the corridor . A few men stood embracing in doorwaysor inside dim rooms , their doors left open.  |p161On  the way out , he dropped the bracelet from his wrist onto the counter . The cashier , still absorbed in the afternoon tabloid , did not even raise his head as he mumbled a perfunctory response to Levanter 's quiet good-by . Walking home through the park , Levanter slowly peeled off the wig , then the eyebrows , mustache , and beard , and threw them , one by one , into the bushes . He thought about the public consequences of his personal deed . Both the authorities and the media would demand a direct connectionbetween the crime committed and the reason for it . They would keep looking for a plot , and to look for a plot in this killing would be as useless as grooming a bronze horse ; no one would be able to untangle the web of circumstances and motives that had led to the clerk 's death . Back in his apartment , Levanter felt safe and secure . Scarcely an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the baths . But what had taken place there had already receded into a remote corner of his memory . It was nothing but an old Polaroid snapshot ; no negative , photographer unknown , camera thrown away.  |p162Knowing  Jacques Monod did not have much time left , Levanter decided to go to Cannes to be with him . When he arrived in town , Levanter discovered that the annual Cannes Film Festival was taking place at the resort . Although Monod had been born and raised in Cannes and in later years spent most of his vacations there , he told Levanter he had never been to the Festival . As Levanter spent part of every day with Monod , he persuaded him to attend a few film events ; and he introduced his ailing friend to some filmmakers , hoping they would provide amusing distraction . After a film screening one afternoon , Levanter noticed a starlet staring at Monod . She approached them and asked guardedly whether Monod was one of the famous stars , like Charles Boyer , who were said to have come to Cannes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of fragments from their old films . Monod was about to introduce himself when Levanter cut in and said that Monod was indeed a famous star , but from another galaxy . " Another galaxy ? " asked the wide-eyed young woman . Levanter nodded . She apologized for not having seen Another Galaxy yet , but assured him that she would as soon as it was released . Later a distinguished French movie director saw Monod on the hotel terrace and recognized him instantly . He greeted him re/spectfully and introduced himself . " We do n't see many Nobel Prize winners here ! " he exclaimed solemnly . Then he introduced Monod to his companion , a statuesque brunette . " This is Doctor Jacques Monod , " he said , " the author of a book that influenced me tremendously . " The woman smiled coyly but said nothing . " You know Chance and Necessity , that book you saw on my night table ? " said the director in a tone of reprimand . The woman extended her hand . " But of course ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , placing the other hand on her hip and leaning slightly toward him . " Are you in Cannes because of the film based on your book ? " she asked , obviously pleased with herself for thinking of the question . Monod , visibly amused , was prepared to answer . But the director , rolling his eyes in frustration , grabbed the woman by the arm and yanked her away . At a gala after one of the films , two starlets asked Levanter who his handsome friend was . Levanter asked them to guess . " He 's handsome enough to be a movie star , " said one , glancing at Monod coquettishly . " Could n't be , " the other argued . " He 's too distinguished-looking . " " The head of a film studio ? " the first guessed . " Too self-assured , " commented the second . " Studio heads only try to look self-assured . He really is . " " A director ? " " Too natural and too well dressed . " She looked at Monod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said after a pause . " Why would you think that ? " asked Levanter . " He looks at you with such analytical eyes , " she murmured . They talked and joked in the afternoon sun on the verandah of Monod 's family home . Levanter picked up his camera to photographMonod . Only from behind the viewfinder did he dare to focus on the barely perceptible evidence of Monod 's illness . There was no startling change , yet certain physical clues , **29;4048;TOOLONG , suggested that the disease had made further inroads on his health . Later in the day , Monod escorted Levanter to his car . " Until tomorrow then ? " said Levanter from behind the wheel . Monod stood beside him but did not answer . Levanter raised his eyes . The two men looked at each other . Levanter knew it was for the last time . " Farewell , my dear boy , " said Monod , finally breaking the silence . Levanter could not speak . Mute , dispirited , he started the engine . Without pausing to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb the steps to the house , the last rays of the setting sun wrapped him in their glow . The dark-haired woman stepped off the boardwalk and strode through the sand to the last empty lounger , just next to where Levanter sat . She untied her robe and slipped it off as she lay down . Like most women on the hotel 's private beach , she was going to sunbathe naked . Her body was evenly tanned ; her skin was smooth , unbroken by fat or wrinkles . She raised her head toward the sun . Levanter looked at her face . A slight thickening at the top of her nose made her face familiar . He moved his lounger closer and leaned toward her . " Forgive me , Signorina , " he said , overlaying his French with an exaggerated Italian intonation to mask his own accent . She turned her head in his direction . He could see that she was annoyed . " Yes ? " She opened one eye . " I ca n't help admiring your face . Your nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As she opened the other eye , he noticed that her irises were as dark as they had seemed in the **28;4079;TOOLONG he had seen years ago . He knew who she was . " Here I lie naked , Signore , " she said , " yet all that fascinates you is my nose ? I should be offended . " She closed her eyes once again . " There is drama behind that irregularity at the bridge , " Levanter went on . " Perhaps your nose was injured in a lovers ' quarrel ? " She did n't respond . " When I look at you lying near me , " continued Levanter , " I can almost see this handsome , strong man  --  your boyfriend , perhaps  --  as he enrages you . I see you fighting him , scratching his face . He slaps you hard . You fall , bleed . Then the hospital . They fix the bone  --  but leave a small bump . Charming , really charming . " He waited for her to react . Still , she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose wanting to leave you . And you do n't want him to go , even though he hurt you . You cry . You make love . You fight again . He gets letters , many letters , urging him to leave . Then he leaves . " Levanter paused . " I see him among tall buildings and villas and beautiful people  --  then I do n't see him anymore . He vanishes . Maybe he is dead ? Now I see you alone . " Slowly she sat up and turned to him . " You are the first fortunetellerI 've ever known who reads not from the palm but from the nose , " she said . " Unless my nose is only a pretext ? " She caught him glancing at her body . " What else do you see ? " Levanter closed his eyes and pressed his fingers against his brow . " I see another man , in America . You never knew him , but he saw pictures of you . I see him writing to your lover , begging him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  behind . I see you in another fight , angrily tearing up these letters . I see him leaving you , and I see that man greeting him in New York . " Levanter paused and glanced at her . She was lying down again . Her eyes were shut , but her head was twisted in his direction . He closed his eyes once more . " Ten years have passed . I see you sunbathing naked in Cannes . I see the man who wrote the letters . He sits beside you on the beach . " She sat up again and faced him . She put on her sunglasses and studied him . " Then you must be that man : George Levanter , " shep166exclaimed . " Levanter ! " she repeated . " How I once hated that name ! " " Only the name ? " asked Levanter . They were both speaking their native Slavic language now . " That was all I knew . " She turned and lay down on her front , her chin resting on one hand . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I met this handsome , strong man '  --  Woytek  --  you had been in America for years . " " Woytek often told me you were the most beautiful girl he had ever seen , " said Levanter . " He said you were still in grade school when he met you and that he started sleeping with you right away . Was that true ? " he asked . She shrugged . " It was and it was not . Who cares ? He was my first lover . Later , you started writing to Woytek , urging him to defect to the West . Your letters turned our life upside-down . Suddenly , all Woytek talked about was Levanter  --  his closest friend , already settled in America , while he was wasting his time with me . He imagined himself with you in Paris , London , New York , Los Angeles . With a successful investor for a friend in the West , how could he fail ? And how could I , simple flesh , compete with such a vision ? So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that American heiress you found for him . And look how it all ended ! " She took her suntan lotion out of her bag and handed it to Levanter . " Could you put some on my back ? " He took the tube , stood up , and leaned over her . He squeezed the cream onto her shoulders and began spreading it . Her skin felt warm and smooth . When he reached her waist , she looked back over her shoulder at him . " There was a time , " she said , smiling , " when if any man touched me , Woytek would take him apart . " As Levanter spread the lotion over her hips and thighs , he found himself thinking back to the time when securing Woytek 's future in America was his main concern . Levanter had telephoned Gibby and told her he had to see her alone to talk about Woytek . They met at a cafe near Central Park.  | " How is Woytek 's English coming along ? " he asked . " It 's improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask me to meet you to talk about Woytek 's English . " " I did n't . It 's about the two of you . " Gibby looked apprehensive , almost panicky . " Did Woytek ask you to talk to me ? " " No . " " What is it then ? " She stared at him , her eyes magnified by the thick lenses of her glasses . Levanter was having difficulty beginning . " I know you and Woytek have no secrets from each other , " she encouraged . " You 're his only close friend in New York . You can be direct with me . " " Ever since I introduced you to Woytek , " said Levanter , trying to sound casual , " you and he have lived in the same tiny West Side studio . Yet you have unlimited charge accounts at all the best shops in town , your wardrobe is made by the finest designers , and your jewelry is worth thousands of dollars . Woytek does n't have a penny . If he wants to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it from his friends . He 's wearing the clothing he arrived in from Eastern Europe because he ca n't afford anything new . It looks to me as if you 've suddenly turned into a penny-pinching shrew , acting as if you were on your own . " Gibby shifted in her chair . " What 's wrong with being on your own ? " " Nothing . But you are n't exactly on your own . You come from one of the richest families in the country and have a trust fund that yields a great deal of money . On top of that , there have been large financial gifts and inheritances over the years . Still , with all your wealth , you wo n't help Woytek , the man you love . " " I wo n't give Woytek money , if that 's what you mean . I do n't want people to think that the one man I want is the one I have to pay for , " she said stubbornly . " Are you going to live your life with Woytek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levanter.  |p168Gibby  looked away . For a moment , Levanter thought she was n't listening . He grew impatient . " If you 're so concerned with what people think , why do you tell them everything about yourself ? Why do you say that before you met Woytek your life oscillated between drinks and sweets , with pot in between ? That , intellectually , Woytek is the first man you have n't had to talk down to ? That only with Woytek can you be open and honest ? " Gibby interrupted . " Woytek loves me for what I am . What I do with my money is my own business . " " But not what you do with Woytek , " said Levanter . " I feel responsible for him . I arranged a blind date for you and Woytek so he could have someone intelligent to speak French with , since that was the only other language he knew then . I did n't expect him to be destroyed . With you , he 's vegetating , but he loves you too much to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of you from enjoying your money and the life it could offer : the world of travel , of new experience , of ideas , of people . " " I do n't want Woytek to be known as a man without a profession , living off my money , " said Gibby . " I do n't care what kind of work he does , as long as he supports himself like everybody else . " " But he 's your lover , and you 're not like everybody else , " Levantersaid sharply . " You are unusually rich . You and your lover are thereby excluded from the fate of the ordinary . Woytek was once a wealthy and educated man . Then he became a refugee . He 's been here only a year  --  half of which he 's lived with you . He does n't know English well enough yet to pursue his profession . You quit your own job when you fell in love with him . Why do you want him to work ? Do n't you understand that getting a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you suppose he could do ? Do n't try to answer me , " said Levanter . " Just listen for a minute . " Gibby glared at him . " All Woytek is suited for at the moment is menial labor : parking cars , scraping paint off ship decks , cleaning bars , something likep169that . He could earn about as much in one month as you spend in one week on restaurant tips when you take your rich cousins to lunch . And it costs you more to pay your monthly phone bill for long-distance calls to your college chums than Woytek would make in an entire year . " Levanter paused . Gibby did not speak . " What is your reasoning ? " Levanter asked . " Do you believe that as long as he 's penniless everyone will think Woytek stays with you for yourself , whereas if you give him money , everyone will think he loves you just for the money ? " Gibby remained silent . Levanter went on . " Woytek was a superb athlete . He used to play soccer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his country . He loved company and enjoyed being surrounded by creative people . Now he 's cooped up in your ground-floor apartmentwhere he ca n't even see daylight , and he ca n't afford to go out . You 've made him your prisoner . " " Maybe I should take him to California , " Gibby said , more to herself than to Levanter . She went on without waiting to hear Levanter 's opinion . " My family is there , and Woytek knows people in Hollywood . There are also those film directors he knew in Europe , " she mused . " Near them , Woytek might regain his own sense of accomplishment and pride  --  and possibly find work . " She looked at Levanter , expecting some response , but now he said nothing . Levanter was in Paris one summer researching the prospects for the marketing of a new American-made ski safety binding . Just before he was to return to New York , he received a long letter from Woytek . He and Gibby were staying in California with their friend Sharon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levanter , whom she had n't seen for a long time , to join them for the rest of August . New York would be every bit as hot and empty as Paris , Le/vanter knew , and Sharon 's house , a large Beverly Hills estate overlooking the center of Los Angeles , offered an inviting escape . He reserved a seat on a flight from Paris to New York , with a connecting flight to Los Angeles , and he cabled Woytek : ARRIVINGFRIDAY AFTERNOON STOP ANXIOUS TO SEE YOU ALL . At the airport he asked the airline clerk to arrange for three of his bags to accompany him and three to be unloaded in New York and held for his return at the end of the month . The clerk handed him a baggage form , which he filled out and returned to her . " You 've made a mistake here , " she said . " You wrote a New York address , but we need your return address in Paris , in case your luggage is not claimed . " " My home is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where the luggage should be sent if something happens to me and I am unable to claim it . " " But you have to claim it , " the clerk insisted . " What if I die ? " " Death finds you without a return address , " the woman said impatiently . " Your luggage does not . " " I can only repeat that my return address is New York . " " As you wish , Monsieur , " she said with a smirk . During the New York stopover , a stewardess checking his ticket for the Los Angeles flight looked at Levanter 's baggage stubs . " I see that all your luggage has been unloaded in New York , " she said . " Are you continuing to Los Angeles without any baggage ? " " I have a lot of luggage , " said Levanter . " Three of my bags were supposed to be transferred to this flight . " " There must be some mistake , sir , " the stewardess said . " All your luggage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfer has been indicated . " She phoned the baggage dispatcher . " Your suitcases are already on their way to the inspection ramp , " she said . She checked her watch . " I 'm sorry , sir . You wo n't have time to go through customs before this flight takes off . " Levanter realized that he should not have argued with the airline clerk in Paris . Once again , he thought , he had been defeated by the French character , as once again the French had somehowp171confused logic with the facts of human existence and emotion . He went through similar ordeals each time he was in France , and each time strove to defend himself against the French bureaucracyof the mind . His comprehension of the French language far exceeded his ability to express himself in it . Consequently , the French treated him in one of two ways : if he succeeded in making himself understood , he was just a foreigner treated with contempt for not having been born French ; if he failed , he was a mental invalid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day , he decided to by-pass altogether the dilemma of language . As an investor , Levanter was required to retain all receipts and bills as proof of his business expenses for the United States Internal Revenue Service . Therefore , each time he bought stamps at a French post office , he would politely ask for a receipt . And each time the French postal employee would routinely refuse , claiming that at the time of purchase he had to submit two copies of a letter of request on his firm 's official stationery , addressed to the specific post office . But there was no room in Levanter 's life for filling out forms in duplicate . Stumbling and jerking , he entered a crowded post office in the center of Paris that day , going straight to the front of the line . As he twitched past the men and women who stood waiting their turn for service , he peered at them defiantly ; they looked at him , then , uncomfortable , dropped their gaze , as if ashamed to be staring at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alarmed clerk raced over . Mumbling incoherently , and spitting saliva through his twisted mouth , Levanter managed to communicate his need for a pencil and paper . Then , his left hand grabbing his right as if to guide it and prevent it from shaking , Levanter wrote that he wanted three dozen air-mail stamps . He pushed the money toward the clerk , who averted his eyes from the cripple 's distorted face and promptly slid the stamps to him . His left hand once again guiding the right , Levanter scribbled down his request for a receipt . The clerk hesitated . Levanter again banged the counter with his fist.  |p172The  supervisor approached , glanced at Levanter 's note , motioned him to calm down , and , whispering that the man might be a French war invalid , ordered the clerk to issue the receipt . Now it occurred to Levanter that he should have thought about this , and many other such experiences he had had in Paris , before engaging the French airline clerk on the subject of his return address . Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his luggage was in New York . Dispirited , he left the plane , claimed his luggage , cleared customs , and went to his New York apartment . He would fly to Los Angeles the next day . He tried to phone Woytek , but there was no answer at Sharon 's house . Exhausted from the journey and the mix-up , he fell into a sound sleep . The next day , Levanter 's phone rang , waking him . A man 's voice said , " Los Angeles Police Department , Coroner 's Office , " and asked to speak to the next of kin of one George Levanter . " There are no relatives , " Levanter told him . " How well did you know this Levanter ? " " Better than anyone else , " he said . " I am George Levanter . " " Are you the George Levanter who sent a telegram about arriving yesterday in Los Angeles ? " " I am . " A long silence . At the other end people were talking in muffled voices . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " My luggage was misdirected . I 'm flying out today . " Another silence . Again a chorus of faraway voices . " Were you coming to Los Angeles to visit friends ? " " That 's what I 'm going there for , " said Levanter . " Have n't you heard the news ? " asked the man , his voice hushed and uncertain . Levanter thought perhaps Sharon 's baby had been born prematurely . " What news ? " The man hesitated . " There was a tragedy here , " he said . " Sharonand her houseguests are dead . They were all murdered lastp173night . " Mechanically , he listed all their names in full . " Also killed was a stranger , a man whose identity we still do n't know . He must have driven up at the time the others were being killed . When your telegram was found , we assumed he was George Levanter . " Levanter felt his heart lose its rhythm . He fought for breath . His mind was in chaos . All he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , " Woytek ? " The man seemed to know what Levanter was asking . " Shot twice . Struck on the head thirteen times . Stabbed fifty-one times . " " And Gibby ? " Levanter murmured . " Twenty-eight stab wounds . No more questions , please , " the man added quickly . " I should n't even have told you this much . You can hear the rest on the news . " As he listened to the radio reports , Levanter stared at a stack of snapshots Woytek had sent him recently of himself and Gibby with Sharon and other friends . Then he looked at the collection of college diaries that Gibby had given him , and reflected that from now on her clean , slightly square handwriting remained his only connection to her . Levanter thought back to the first time he had met Woytek . Several boys were playing " Name the Jew " in the schoolyard . In that game , one boy stood in the center while the others slowly circled around him . He was " the Rabbi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designated " the Jew . " Each time the Rabbi guessed wrong he was fined a penny or a possession . The sooner the Rabbi found the Jew , the fewer fines he had to pay . Everyone had a chance to be Rabbi , and the Rabbi with the fewest wrong guesses won all the fines lost by the others , becoming " the Greatest Taker of Them All . " As Levanter was walking past the group , the Rabbi spotted him and called him into the circle . He refused to play the game , and the Rabbi ordered him to be brought over by force . Three or four boys rushed toward Levanter . He pushed the first one away and had almost managed to escape from the others when two more boys cutp174him off . Suddenly a tall boy whom Levanter did not know came along ; although he was not a Jew , he said , he found the game disgraceful . Single-handedly , he knocked down two attackers , the rest backed off , and the game was over . This tall boy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first moved to Los Angeles . One afternoon , the two men went for a drive in a car Woytek had borrowed from one of his wealthy friends . They drove through Beverly Hills on their way down to Sunset Boulevard , passing the lavish bungalows and sprawling villas . Shiny automobilesstood in the curved driveways , apron-clad gardeners manicured the grounds , strings of invisible sprinklers sent up fine sprays that turned sunlight into rainbows . No sound broke the serenity of the hills and the private enclave . In minutes they were in Hollywood . Groups of haggard young men and women in shabby jeans , many barefoot , strolled aimlessly along the crowded sidewalks or lounged on the pavement . Vacant looks on their faces , they seemed to have little to say to each other , nothing to do , no place to go . " In other countries , " said Woytek , " people like these would be starving , and they would join the Party to fight the rich . " Levanter was suddenly aware that his friend 's English had improvedso greatly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . " Here they 're not hungry , " Woytek continued , " so they have no need to join anything . They sleep through the day and in the evening crawl out to the streets . I call them Crabs of Sunset . But they 're not like nature 's crabs , because Crabs of Sunset are out of balance with their world . I think they may be the missing link between man and robot . " Woytek steered the car through the traffic , stopping from time to time to watch the sluggish mass crossing in front of them . Levanter noticed with some amusement that Woytek looked pleased when several young men and women enviously eyed the expensive custom-built sports car he was driving . " Had California been an independent country , " Woytek said , " itp175would long ago have gone fascist  --  Left or Right , it would n't matter . For the Right , Crabs of Sunset would become the fuel for the draconic measures that would be used to get rid of them ; for the Left , they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it is , the State of California has become the embodiment of their mental state : neither Right nor Left , with no shape or direction , a giant amoeba . Here everything stretches  --  nature and people . " They turned around , heading back toward Beverly Hills . " You know , " said Woytek , " one night , when they are hungry , these Crabs of Sunset may stretch out as far as their neighbors in the hills . " " Why do you suppose that has n't happened already ? " asked Levanter . " They simply have n't had time to stretch that far yet . " " And the people in the hills ? Do n't they fear the Crabs might come ? " " Those are rich people , " said Woytek . " They think they always win . But in fact they 're losing twice : once while they 're alive , because with so much to lose they never really take chances ; and once when they die , because being rich they lose so much . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes stretched on all sides . " Some of these people take only the most naive precautions , " Woytek said . " This house , for example . " He pointed out of his window . " It 's probably equipped with every conceivable electronic safety device , and every person on the staff may be armed  --  even those two little spaniels might be wearing sound transmitters on their collars . " Levanter chuckled . " Is n't that sufficient security ? " he asked . Woytek shook his head . " I once asked a man who lives near here , What if Crabs of Sunset stop you in your car , outside your fancy fortress ? These hills of yours , ' I said , have everything but pedestrians who would hear your screams and rush to the rescue . You might not have time to activate your Citizens Band radio . ' The man said he thought I had a sick imagination . "  |p176Levanter  asked , " What about the police ? " " They do n't have homes in the hills , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect the bodies and fingerprints , and to talk to the reporters about the supposed motive . " " Yet you and I are not afraid here , " said Levanter . " We are not , " said Woytek , " because we 've known greater fear in other places . " The news reports went on all day . Levanter kept imagining it was the night before and he was with his friend . Woytek is alone in the living room , looking out the window . Way below , as far as he can see , the boulevards and freeways of Los Angeles stretch like a thousand runways of a giant airport . It is twilight ; he is waiting for Levanter to arrive . The blinking lights of the city are beginning to fuse with the blinking of the stars . Perhaps , Woytek thinks , that 's why the city was named Los Angeles . From here on Cielo Drive , the drive of the sky , it almost seems one can look down on the angels . He thinks of Levanter ; his departure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes . Paris , he muses , Left today , Right tomorrow , or the other way around . It is getting darker . Gibby is in a bedroom reading . Sharon is resting in her room . Jay , an old family friend , is elsewhere in the house . Levanter is on his way to Los Angeles , the city he likes so much . Woytek stretches out on the sofa . All is quiet . A peaceful house on Cielo Drive , he thinks , a peaceful hill , far above the caves of the scruffy hordes of Crabs of Sunset . He dozes off . He is awakened by unfamiliar voices . He opens his eyes . A gun is pointing at him . It is in the hand of a pale young man who has a solid swelling under his cheekbone . Three teen-age girls stand next to him , each holding a knife and loops of rope . In their limp cotton skirts and loose hanging blouses , they seem lost in the room , unsure , and they glance occasionally at the solid walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare at Woytek vacantly . Crabs of Sunset , Woytek thinks.  | " What can I do for you , sir and ladies ? " asks Woytek sarcastically . The man motions with his gun . " Do n't move , pig . We 're here to kill you all . " His stare remains fixed and indifferent . " What are you , ghosts from a Boris Karloff movie coming to meet your maker ? " says Woytek , stretching up slowly . " This is Cielo Drive . Old Boris 's ghost lives on Bowmont . " Like a stiff-jointed dummy , the man steps forward and hits him on the head with the butt of his gun . Woytek hears the crack and for a moment loses his balance . He wants to jump at the attacker , but the man holds the gun to his head . Woytek lies down again , feeling a trickle of blood from his forehead . His gun still trained on Woytek , the man turns to one of the girls . " Tie him up , " he snaps . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he orders the other two girls , who trot off like trained retrievers . The one assigned to Woytek tucks her knife into her skirt and edges toward him , a stubborn look in her eyes . As she leans over him to tie his wrists behind his back , he smells her unclean body and sees her face covered with blemishes , the pus ready to be squeezed out . Woytek 's blood smears onto her , but she ignores it . Under the gaze of the pale young man , the girl goes to the other end of the sofa and starts to bind Woytek 's ankles . He watches her ; she seems to be following a script prepared by an invisible agency monitoring her from afar . " What is it you people want ? " asks Woytek . " Money ? Love ? Fame ? " He is suddenly conscious of his foreign accent . The man with the gun turns away and , without a word , leaves the room . The girl has finished her job ; she looks at Woytek with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is soaking through her blouse and Woytek wonders whether it is seeping onto her small breasts . She catches his gaze . Suddenly , she grabs her knife and stabs Woytek in the leg , then , rapidly , in the chest and belly . In sudden pain , Woytek jerks away , howls , and almost rolls off the sofa . Sneering , she pokes him back into place with the knife.  |p178Blood  oozes from the wounds , clinging to his jaw , wetting his clothes , staining the sofa . The girl stands over him . His bleeding and pain make no impact on her . He tries to reassure himself that women are accustomed to the sight of blood because they menstruate , and that the girl is only trying to intimidate him . His leg goes numb . Still , behind his back , he is trying to wiggle his wrists free . To distract her , he turns his head to the side and looks at her bloodied skirt . It could almost be her own blood , he thinks . Again , the girl catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and drops her hand , digging into his chest . As the shriek tears out of his throat , Woytek feels the blade hitting a rib , which stops it from sinking farther . His legs kick spasmodically , and she withdraws the knife . Fresh blood gushes out . He no longer doubts that she intends to kill him . Woytek weakens and for a moment feels weightless . He is about to give in to this sensation when he hears Gibby scream . He turns , raising his head , and sees her on the staircase , being urged down by one of the girls , who keeps jabbing her with a carving knife . Gibby 's face is bruised and pale , her glasses have been knocked off . There are red marks on her white robe . Does Gibby have her period ? He ca n't remember . There was a time , he recalls , just after they became lovers , when she could n't bring herself even to talk about it . She was ashamed of her body , ashamed of going to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask for it . But that is all past now . She has learned to give generously of herself . Her body is free ; she is not afraid to receive pleasure or to give it . Their love has survived its harsh beginnings : they are finished prompting each other with hard drugs ; at last they are at ease together . Gibby is shaking and crying . The girl behind her swings her hand down and , pitching forward , stabs her ; the red marks on Gibby 's robe grow larger and blood is streaking down her legs . Gibby is falling down the stairs . She crashes against the railing , then gets up and tries to run , but she falls again . The long knife isp179flashing in the girl 's hand . She brings it close to Gibby 's neck to show she is ready to slash her throat . The redness spreads all over Gibby 's robe . Woytek hears Gibby offering the girl money and credit cards . He hears the girl 's cackling laughter . She says she does not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he shouts , his voice tearing through his body as the pain mounts in his chest . Spinning violently , the girl beside him rams him with her knife again . It sinks deep into his groin . There is so little time left , he thinks , howling . He closes his eyes , pretending to faint . Gibby should try to bluff her way out . She should tell the attackers who she is  --  they must have seen her name in thick bold letters on cans in every supermarket they 've ever been to . She should tell them they can gain nothing by killing her ; she is rich , among the richest in this rich land , and she can give them money if they will let her go . She should tell them who she is , tell them about her money . Anything to stop them . He thinks of shouting all this at them himself , but his mind is tired , clutching at the thought : one wrong phrase and Gibby may again think he 's trying to use her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused : his thoughts drift back and forth from his native tongue to English ; he can not anchor them in one language or the other . As he writhes , he feels the rope loosening on his wrists . He has one chance only ; he waits for the appropriate moment to make his move . He keeps his eyes closed , even when he hears the screams of Sharon and Jay and the sounds of a scuffle . He hears the man with the gun order one of the girls to keep watch outside . He hears Gibby scream again , then Sharon pleading for her baby . Jay yells for Sharon and Gibby to get out if they can . Woytek finally looks . He sees Gibby tied to a chair . Sharon and Jay are tied together , lying on the floor . Jay 's entire face is a red raw mass , yet he struggles free of his ropes and manages to get up , when the man points the gun at him . A shot explodes . Jay 's head lolls to one side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent ,  |p180shrinking  into himself , his neck squeezed between his shoulders , a froth of blood on his mouth . Gibby and Sharon shriek . Jay 's body folds into the pool of blood and does not move . The man plays with his gun and smiles . He threatens to shoot the rest of them if they are not quiet . Then he and the girl who has been guarding Woytek ponder aloud whether to shoot him ; they decide to save the bullets for later . The man points at Woytek and says to the girl , " The big pig is yours . Finish him off . " He strides over to Sharon and Gibby . The girl stands next to the sofa . She still holds the bloodied knife . Behind his back , Woytek 's hands are now free . He is ready to spring up . Just then he hears a car pull up to the main gate . For a moment , the killers panic ; the man with the gun runs out . Levanter must have arrived , thinks Woytek . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . The girl beside him fidgets . Rocking from side to side , she raises her knife . Woytek suddenly sits up and butts her in the chest with his head , knocking her to the floor . Grabbing her by the hair , he holds her on the floor with one hand while he unties the rope around his ankles with the other . He feels dizzy ; blood pours out of his body with each move , but he keeps pulling her head by twisting her hair around his wrist . She yells to another girl to help her . Gibby and Sharon start to shout and throw themselves about , and the girl guarding them begins to stab them randomly . Woytek increases his pull , and the girl strains and jumps . The blood from the wounds on his head blinds him for a moment . Kicking herself away from the sofa , the girl pulls Woytek down onto the floor . He pounces at her throat . They roll together , knocking over chairs , gripping each other in a tight embrace . Woytek 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads and knees and elbows bang against each other in the frenzied wrestling . He feels his fingers in the girl 's mouth , and he pushes his hand deeper , tearing at the slippery mucous surfaces . Yet , even with his hand at her throat , she keeps on stabbing him , and he can not stop her . Woytek sees Gibby suddenly wrench herself free of the chair and run across the room toward the door to the garden . Her captor catches her , blockingp181the door with a knife . Panicking , the other girl pushes Gibby outside and follows Woytek to the garden door . As he crosses the threshold , the girl overtakes him , stabbing him time after time in the back . Fresh blood warms him like sweat . He hurls himself outside . The girl falls upon him , stabbing and stabbing . As they grapple on the mist-wrapped lawn , she yells and screams for help . Woytek scrambles up and breaks away from her , running toward the fence , across the lawn , falling , getting up , falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sees the other girl stabbing Gibby and sees Gibby collapsing onto the dewy grass . Woytek strains to call out into the darkness for help , but his breath whistles in his throat . The man with the gun steps out of the dark and hits him over the head repeatedly . The girl stumbles over and , with a downward motion of her arm , sticks her knife into him again . He feels no more pain . The man points the gun at him ; Woytek falls to his knees . As he crawls over the lawn , two bullets hit him in the leg . Something snaps inside his chest . Quivering , he can feel only the clumps of earth on his lips . He looks up and sees four silent figures bent over him , but he no longer knows who they are or what they are doing so near him , so close to the sky that spreads behind them like a black fan . Woytek 's final image , is of himself as a boy making an anonymouscall to the Secret Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woytek says he has an important tip for them . In an old abandoned factory on the outskirts of town , on the top floor near the elevator shaft , some young people have stored a cache of arms and explosives . An agent takes his message and he hangs up . Hours later , Woytek waits on the top floor , hiding near the elevator shaft . An unmarked car arrives . Through the window he sees two agents in gabardine raincoats running toward the entrance , guns in hand . He hears them on the decrepit staircase . They reach the top , they are near him . He holds his breath . As they look into the shaft , he jumps from behind and , arms spread , gathers the two men against each other , pushing them into the open shaft . They fall screaming  --  a long double howl , then silence . He must vanish from the factory . He runs . As he is running , he is older , and a beautifulp182girl is running beside him , but he is faster , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high above Los Angeles , he is finally safe . The shaft of the abandoned factory . The girl behind . All this was and was not . Who said that to him ? It was and it was not . The death of his friends was incomprehensible to Levanter . He tried to make himself believe that they had all died in a crash in a sports car or were buried in a house in one of the landslides so common in the area . He was too restless to stay home alone , too restless even for company , yet he had a need to be among people . He walked the city streets , stopped for a drink at a bar , rode a bus or subway , and he kept looking into the faces of strangers , considering how impenetrablethey were , asking himself whether these were the faces of victims or oppressors , whether they were people capable of murder . In every place , there were always several people he wished he knew , several he wanted to talk to , to learn about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would they be amused by the games he had seen in some European cities ? Would they enjoy the colorful ducks tapping a frenetic dance on a metal platter if they knew the platter was connected to a battery that sent electric shocks through the bird 's body each time the webbed feet stepped on it ? Would they be entertained by the man who tucks his trousers into his boots , then slips two fierce-looking rats into his baggy pants , buckles up , and waits while blood begins to seep through the fabric ? The bystanders move away in horror , sure that his flesh is being eaten away by the rats . He bleeds more and more , and when everyone around appears convinced that he will bleed to death , he smiles and opens his fly : two dead rats fall out , and behind them jumps a little ferret , its jaws still full of hunks of rat meat . Staring into the faces of strangers , Levanter regretted that in his profession individuals were perceived only in relation to the grand schemes of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive . He should have been in a profession which allowed him to analyze one single human being at a time . For this ,  |p183he  was envious of one of his friends , a famous plastic surgeon . The surgeon spoke about all his operations as if they were routine . For each patient , however , the surgery might be the major event of his or her life  --  whether it was correcting a harelip , rebuilding a nose or hand , tightening facial skin , giving new contoursto breasts , hips , buttocks , or thighs , or smoothing over scars left by diseases or accidents . Levanter watched several operations : steel penetrating living tissue , cotton sponging up blood , chisels sculpting bone , scalpels etching in skin . He marveled at the surgeon 's skill , his ability to remold features , lifting the skin so far off the muscles of the face that his gloved hand could vanish inside it as if slipping into a pocket . Levanter observed as open veins were cauterized and droplets of hot fat spurted out ; as globs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pried away ; and as rows of tiny threads were knotted by fingers moving faster than those of a seamstress . Levanter spent hours in this operating theater , elated , curious , fascinated , watching the surgeon respond to physical reality . His friend 's investment required no explanation ; the motive was implicitin the result , and the result was obvious for everyone to see : the defeat of blind nature by rational man . In order to close a complex deal that involved companies on both coasts , Levanter rented a house in the canyons of Beverly Hills , not far from Cielo Drive , and commuted between it and his New York apartment . He was reluctant to become part of the busy social life of Los Angeles , still preferring to rely on chance encounters . One day , in a UCLA bookshop , Levanter noticed a young woman . She walked between the shelves of paperbacks , scanning them as she went by , slowing down now and then to read a title . Walking behind her , Levanter felt there was something indefinably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a university student . She stopped to pick up a book . He was passing her when she turned and looked him straight in the eye . " Are you following me ? " she asked . Levanter was taken aback . " Yes . That is "  --  he hesitated  --  " I 've been watching you . " She did not look away . " Why ? " she asked . " I want you , but I do n't know why . I am sorry you are not forsale in this shop . I 'm trying to find out the source of my need . " She looked at him quizzically . " And have you found out ? " " Not yet . It takes time , " said Levanter . She replaced the book and glanced at the clock over the cashier 's counter . " You have almost three minutes before I leave , " she said playfully . " May I follow you ? " asked Levanter . She turned back to him , smiling . " You may not . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But one day , when I 'm free , perhaps I 'll call you . " " I might be in New York . " " I might be there too , " she said . Levanter wrote his name and telephone numbers on both coasts on a piece of paper . " I have answering services for both numbers , " he said . " I do n't leave messages , " she said , putting the paper in her purse . " What 's your name ? " Levanter asked . " Serena . " " Serena who ? " " Serena ! How many Serenas do you know ? " A car horn honked twice . She walked out of the bookshop toward the chauffeur-driven sedan . Levanter noticed how gracefullyshe slid into the rear seat . She did not look back at him as the car made the turn onto Sunset Boulevard . Several days later , when he was in New York and had begun to doubt that he would ever hear from her , she phoned.  | " Have you found out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Found out what ? " " The source of your need . " " I have , " said Levanter . " You are . " " How do you know ? " she asked . " You resemble a girl I made a pass at in a summer camp once . " " Then she is your source , not I. " " You are , " said Levanter . " When can I see you ? " He could hear no sound at the other end and was terrified that she had hung up . Just then she said , " What 's your address ? " Serena called about once a week , and only when she was ready to see him . He might have been planning to go to the theater that evening with some friends who were soon to pick him up . But his decision was always instantaneous : for Serena he was available at any time . When she summoned him , he would telephone his friends and say that urgent business had come up and he could n't join them for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might have invited a date for him . He would apologize : here he was an investor , he joked , who wanted to be master of his fate yet could n't even master his leisure time . When the house intercom buzzed and the doorman announced a young lady on her way up , Levanter 's heart would quicken . By the time she entered his apartment , he had usually managed a semblance of calm . There was an air of confidence about her . She never wore make-up and her clothes were selected with care ; she appeared to be the well-bred coed dressed for a date in the big city . When she came to embrace him , she always seemed fresh , unspoiled . Each time , like a curious child , she would flip through the business letters on his desk , take a look at the pile of books on his bed table , turn the tape recorder on and off , examine the photographs of him skiing that hung on the walls . She 'd go toward the bathroom , Levanter close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath.  |p186Then  she would study herself in the mirror and check his medicine cabinet , picking up some of the vials and reading aloud the names of the drugs and the doctors who had prescribed them . As she climbed into the full tub , she would ask Levanter to plug in the whirlpool machine , which she set between her legs . Levanter remained in the bathroom , watching her until she stood up and handed him the bottle of scrub granules . He poured some into his palms and let his hands slide slowly over her back , her belly , her breasts and nipples , until all the sandy granules had worked up into suds . To keep her balance , she clutched the shower-curtain rod , facing him , her lips parted , eyes closed . Her body would be taut , her legs spread wide . He kept stroking her , first gently , then harder and rougher ; the lather foamed on her skin , hiding her flesh and his fingers from view . Her body , stirring under his touch , seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , letting his fingers play and circle and wander over her , until the foam subsided . Levanter would help her out of the tub and , with a fluffy towel , rub her until she was dry and cooled off . After her bath , holding his robe tightly around herself , she sat in his rocking chair , waiting for him to put a mood into her , as she called it . She loved to be aroused by listening to a man talk , she claimed , and she knew that her arousal would then excite him . She insisted he tell her things about himself , stories that would break the routine of her life . Sometimes he would be telling her about an incident that took place a few years earlier at the time of some headlined public event and Serena would draw a blank , reminding him that she was too young to know of this . She was just a little girl when some of these things happened , she would say , rocking back and forth and looking at him as if he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would never tell him anything about herself . Not a passing reference to her family , her school , or her friends . Levanter had examined her belongings and found out that she carried a lot of cash but no driver 's license or any document that could identify her.  |p187She  refused to answer his questions about her life away from him , dismissing them as utterly irrelevant to their sporadic meetings . For a while Levanter thought that , like Gibby , she came from a wealthy and distinguished family and did not want her origins to affect her relationship with him . Later , it crossed his mind that she might be kept by a rich , older married man who was a public figure . But though she would reveal nothing about her private life , Serena always wanted to know about him , his friends , his business acquaintances , his interests in things other than herself . Soon he began taking her to cocktail parties and dinners , and all his male friends were delighted with her . One night , after a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he was interested in her when he had so many more fascinating contacts . " To friends who have known me for years , " he told Serena , " I try to be what they want me to be . Only with strangers like you am I what I really feel myself to be . " Serena was a good listener , and as she sat spellbound she remindedLevanter of a game he had participated in as a student in Moscow . One autumn , Levanter and several other students were assigned by the university to give lectures at a collective farm near the capital , traveling to and from the farm by train . There were always peasants taking the train to a farmers ' market on the way , and they invariably listened in on the young people 's conversation . A studentwho was a good storyteller would begin a tale ; as the train approached the market station , the drama would mount , with the narrator piling incident upon incident of comedy and tragedy , of betrayal and passion , of happy reunions and incurable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , laughing or crying or gasping with terror . The train would stop at the market , but they were so engrossed , so afraid to miss a word , that they never moved . As the train pulled away from the platform and began to pick up speed , the story would end abruptly . Thep188peasants would then suddenly become aware that they had missed their stop . But they were never disappointed and never failed to thank the student for his story . The farmers ' market would always be where it was , they said , but a storyteller took their minds to places where they could not travel . Each day a different student would tell the story , luring another group of peasants , who would also miss their station . At the end of the week , the student whose storytelling had caused the largest number of peasants to miss the market stop won the game . Serena had contempt for any predictability in lovemaking . She was upset when she triggered Levanter 's orgasm too soon . To her , an orgasm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to the body , desire was to the mind : all she wanted was to sustain the passion , to make desire flow incessantly . Often , when her body wriggled under his tongue , she seemed so engrossed in sensation that he thought she would not even feel it if he bit into her flesh . For Serena , just as passion was demonstrated by gesture , desire was expressed by language . She would ask him continually about his feelings and responses . When his mouth was on her flesh , she wanted to know whether he felt that his tongue was shaping her . When she kept him aroused , she asked if he was aware of her giving him pleasure , or of himself , or only of the pleasure . And each time they were together , she kept demanding that he tell her what it was that made him want her so much . Levanter could not link his need for Serena to any particular attitude , to any particular yearning . When she was not with him , he was an objective witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to another man . When she was with him , he was devoted to her , like a criminal who could not part company with an accomplice . He wondered whether it was her body that he wanted or simply her way of perceiving him , of giving him a sexual reality that he had lacked before . He recalled a young woman he had once met inp189Switzerland . Then , as with Serena , he did not understand the nature of his desire . He had just walked into a drugstore in ValPina . A nurse was pushing a large pram toward the exit , and he peeked in . Only a face showed above the blanket . Levanter was surprised to see that it was the face of a woman in her early twenties . He thought it was a special kind of wheelchair and tried to see how her body was fitted into it . The body outlined under the blanket was no bigger than a baby 's . The woman seemed to be conscious of his curiosity and smiled at him . He smiled back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nurse cleared her throat to get his attention , then threw him a look of reprimand as she pushed the carriage out of the shop . The proprietor of the drugstore , who had observed the encounter , told him that it was a woman in the baby carriage . She was twenty-six years old , the child of a well-known , prosperous foreign family . As an infant , she contracted a bone disease that left her grossly deformed ; the doctors did not expect her to live , but the family was able to provide the best possible care and she had survived . Her head was of normal size , but the rest of her body was stunted and she had no legs . Thus she had to be fed and cared for by others . Even though she was so greatly handicapped , the proprietor said , the young woman was intelligent and had been living a rewarding life . She went to school , spoke four languages , and was about to receive an advanced degree from one of the best art schools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; as an investor , he explained , he was interested in the concrete predicamentsthat life set for each of us . The proprietor agreed to introduce him and the next day telephoned to ask him to a party given by a friend 's son , who went to the university with the young woman and had invited her . It was a crowded party ; she arrived about an hour after it began . Wrapped in a short blanket , she was carried in without much effortp190by a young man , who propped her on the sofa between two pillows . As most of the guests knew her , her arrival caused no unusual commotion . Several students came over to say hello ; two or three sat around her on the sofa , others came and went . Slowly , Levanter made his way toward her . Soon the person who had brought him to the party introduced them . The girl smiled and , in an even , soft voice , said she recognized him from the drugstore . Levanter was struck by the scope of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unbending , barely mobile , fingers , stuck from her tiny torso like the forelegs of a baby toad . Under the blanket , her body appeared to be not much larger than the head it supported . " I understand you are a student , " said Levanter . " What do you study ? " " History of art , " she answered . " Any particular period ? " " A particular subject , " she said . " The role of the human head in Christian art . " She smiled thoughtfully . " As you can see , I have a vested interest in my studies . " " I 'm sorry I stared at you yesterday , " said Levanter . She laughed . " Do n't be sorry . I like being noticed . I 've spent years trying to persuade my nurse that the only unkind ones are those who do n't want to look at me . But she still disapproves of the staring . " She paused , then laughed again . " She should see the stares I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he had misunderstood her . " When you what ? " he asked . " Hitchhike , " she said . " Each summer a friend takes me to the main highway and thumbs a ride for me . Of course , I always have money and my papers with me . Eventually , someone  --  a man or woman , a couple , or even a family  --  comes along who does not mind picking me up . After that , I 'm on my own  --  passed from hand to hand , from car to car , traveling across Europe . " " Are n't you afraid ? " asked Levanter . " Afraid of what ? " " Of strangers . Someone could hurt you . "  |p191She  looked at him . " Hurt me ? " She seemed surprised . " Most of the people I meet are protective of me . They are even reluctant to let me go , afraid that people they pass me to wo n't take care of me as well as they have . " Her voice was weak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate that had mangled her body took nothing away from the wholeness of her face . The features were singularly expressive , giving trace to the nature and intensity of her thoughts and feelings . " When I first began hitchhiking , " she said , " my parents were afraid I might be kidnapped and held for ransom . But that never happened . I 'm sure even professionals could n't bring themselves to kidnap just a head . After all , is n't it the head they threaten to send back when their demands are not met in time ? " She laughed again . The young man who had carried her in approached them . She introduced him to Levanter as her boyfriend . He carried her off to the buffet . Levanter realized he had been imagining himself as her lover . He examined the feeling carefully and found nothing morbid about his craving . What fascinated him about this young woman was that she had incorporated her deformity into the totality of her life . She was a woman , and her view of herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as mysterious and exciting to him as that of any woman he had ever desired . He wanted to become an object of her emotions and her passions , to enter her world and be given her knowledge of it . Later in the evening , Levanter asked the girl for a date . She told him politely that she was too emotionally committed to her boyfriendto see anyone else . Levanter 's New York apartment was in mid-Manhattan , on a high floor , with a terrace overlooking one of the city 's busiest intersections . Occasionally , to amuse themselves , he and Serena would aim his powerful garden hose over the high wooden fence on the terrace and shoot a stream of water down onto the avenue below , trying to hit hansoms carrying tourists from the big hotelsp192toward Central Park . The perfect score was to strike the passengers but not the horse and the driver ; when the passengers were soaked , they would scream , and the driver , uncomprehending , would instinctivelystop the carriage ; by the time he started up again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not know where it came from . One summer night , a Hollywood studio held a giant reception for the New York premiere of a film in the new marble mezzanine of the subway station under the intersection . A crowd of spectators , press photographers , and a television crew had gathered on the sidewalk . The entrance to the subway was directly under Levanter'sterrace , and he and Serena , their hose ready , were able to see the event both in immediate view and , as the event was nationally televised , in close-up on the television set Levanter had moved out to the terrace for the occasion . First , an actor known for his macho performances stepped from a long black limousine , waving to the crowd , which roared in response . Just as he was blinded momentarily by the floodlights , Levanter and Serena turned the hose on . In seconds , they could see their torrent on TV , washing over the man 's rugged features , upsetting his smooth toupee . As his make-up began to dilute right in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the subway . A famous Hollywood golden-youth couple emerged from their sleek auto and embraced before the cameras . They were just about to kiss for the benefit of millions of fans when the first dose of water blasted their perfect profiles . Dripping wet , they scurried to the subway , colliding at the entrance . Levanter and Serena accomplished several successful dousings before the police , the cameramen , the press , and the crowd , all laughing , looked up to see the source of the stream ; nothing was visible in the dark but endless rows of indistinguishable windows and terraces . Once , after they had soaked several carriages , Levanter and Serena noticed the doorman from a building across the way point/ing to the pool of water in the middle of the street . He kept motioning toward the sky as he talked to a group of curious passers-by . Levanter and Serena went down and walked over , pretending they had just noticed the puddle . " It has n't been raining , has it ? " said Levanter to the doorman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorman looked at him and Serena . " I can tell that you folks do n't live here in the city , " he said with a wise grin . " No , we do n't , " said Serena . The man gestured at the surrounding high-rise apartment houses , hotels , and office skyscrapers . " It 's quite a place down here , as you can see , " he said solemnly . " All these tall buildings generate a lot of magnetism . Every few days that magnetism makes a little cloud , right about here . " He pointed straight above the pool of water . " A small cloud , it 's true , but it produces enough rain to make this puddle and sometimes to sprinkle on hansom cabs going by . " Proud of his explanation , he looked at his listeners for some sign of appreciation of his knowledge . Levanter and Serena nodded thoughtfully . " On different days , that little cloud may move just a couple of feet to the left or maybe to the right , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mysteries , " he concluded as another knot of people gathered around to hear his theories . Serena phoned . She was flying into Los Angeles and was free to spend the night with him , she said . He immediately canceled his other plans and agreed to collect her in three hours at the airport . Almost automatically , he asked where she was . " There is no message , " she whispered . Levanter took a taxi to the airport . He was half an hour early and dismissed the cab . He wandered through the lounges , watched the departing passengers lined up to pass through the gates of the electronic surveillance gadgetry , had a cup of coffee , and finally went to stand at the entrance of the terminal , where he was to meet her.  |p194She  appeared , looking pleased to see him there . Behind her , a porter carried a dress bag and a soft fabric suitcase . Neither piece had an airline baggage tag . Outside the terminal , the dispatcher was trying to hail a yellow cab for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looked far more spacious and comfortable and appeared to be for hire . He gestured to the driver , a short , middle-aged man , who quickly jumped out and came to pick up Serena 's luggage . Opening the trunk , the driver tossed both pieces inside . Serena saw that he had thrown the suitcase on top of the dress bag and spoke to him sharply about crushing her dresses . He glanced at her and , without saying anything , rearranged the luggage . Then he closed the trunk , got behind the wheel , and waited for his passengers to get in . Levanter gave the driver the address , asking whether he knew the way to the spot high up in Beverly Hills . The man looked at him in the rearview mirror and , again without a word , started the engine and drove off , accelerating as he reached the freeway . Serena moved closer to Levanter . She put her leg over his , and he felt the pressure on his groin , the force of her hip against his . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caressing her , until she stretched over him , tense and excited . He put his left arm around her , and as she rested her head on his shoulder , he traced the outline of her breasts , then began stroking her through the thin fabric of her dress . Under his hands , she shivered and pressed against him . The car turned off the freeway and sped along an empty road . Levanter saw that they had taken the wrong exit . He disengaged himself from Serena and leaned forward to tell the driver that he had left the freeway too soon and would have to go back and continue to the Beverly Hills exit . But the driver seemed to be in a daze . He did not answer , did not even look up into the rearview mirror . Instead , he accelerated suddenly , screeched across Sunset Boulevard , and started to climb along one of the dark roads of the canyon . The sudden turns and speed seemed to agitate Serena.  |p195Visibly  frightened , she was about to say something when Levanter squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he sat , Levanter could see three fourths of the driver 's face . The man 's hair glistened with perspiration , droplets of sweat streaked along his cheeks and neck and dripped from his eyebrows ; Levanter wondered why he was wearing a heavy woolen jacket over his shirt . The driver made another rapid turn ; one tire mounted the sidewalk and the front fender scraped the embankment . They were still going up the steep hill , and the engine , throttle fully open , was straining , its whine alternating with the screech of the tires . At an intersection , the driver speeded up and barely avoided running into a car making a turn . At another intersection , he slowed down so suddenly that the car behind almost smacked into them . Pushing herself rigidly against the backrest , her feet on the back of the driver 's seat , Serena clutched Levanter 's arm . She held her breath and , staring over the driver 's shoulder , kept her eyes glued to the road . Assuming an even , almost joking tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that the constant slowing down and speeding up was making him and his companion dizzy . But the man did not respond . Gripping the wheel tighter with both hands , he made another rapid turn . For an instant , two tires lost their hold on the road ; in reaction , the driver jerked the steering wheel the other way and the tires banged back onto the road . As they soared over the crest of the hill , Serena screamed and started to shout abuses at the man , but he only went faster . Frantically , she tried to open the car door as they sped down the other side of the hill , but Levanter restrained her . She trembled and cried . The man had made no threats ; he had waved no weapons and did not seem to be concerned about whether his passengers had any . Still , Levanter felt he had to stop him . He could grab the driver from behind and choke him , but there was the danger that , fighting back , the driver might press even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crash.
