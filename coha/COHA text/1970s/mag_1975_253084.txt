THURBER by BURTON BERNSTEIN 532 pages . Dodd , Mead . $15 . <P> <P> To some extent a great man can control his autobiographer . With biographers he must trust to luck , and James Thurber has not been lucky . A couple of years ago , an academician named Charles Holmes produced a solemn literary biography called The Clocks of Columbus , in which he discerned , for instance , three levels of language in the 2,500 words of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty . Now comes New Yorker Writer Burton Bernstein with a drink-by-drink analysis , or bibulography , of the humorist 's sometimes agonizing life . <P> Holmes ' book was merely plonking and dull , and thus ludicrously inappropriate ; Bernstein 's is plonking and offensive . What offends is not the old news that Thurber had sexual problems , drank a lot and toward the end was often outrageously abusive at parties . That description fits half the writers listed in Books in Print . No adult should expect a humorist , or anyone else for that matter , to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thurber 's life , which was his subject matter , has been smeared with tedium . It is little service to Thurber or the reader to print windy , dozen-page letters of no high literary quality when a few quoted phrases and a sentence of summary would have conveyed the nature of most of them . Bernstein prints them , almost without excision . Bernstein , moreover , is the kind of writer who tries for breeziness by referring , for instance , to New York City as " Gotham , " to England as " Albion " and to Hollywood as " the fabled Tinseltown . " He sees nothing wrong , either , with writing " his scrupulously guarded virginity , hidden for so long on that same lofty pedestal where American Womanhood dwelled , was surrendered to a semiprofessional demimondaine , a Folies-Bergre dancer named Ninette , and was continued with another . " ( What , exactly , was continued ? ) <P> Another lapse may or may not have its source in the fact that this is an authorized biography . The author 's view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration and necessary candor . But Thurber 's first wife Althea , a campus beauty at Ohio State during his years there , appears as an unpleasant caricature-by no coincidence closely resembling her ex-husband 's caricature of the engulfing Thurber Woman . Second Wife Helen Thurber , who shared his life through his years of dimming eyesight and blindness ( and who did the authorizing ) is treated with warmth . Clearly she deserves it , but the disparity between the two portraits nevertheless smacks of the dreary side-taking that follows any suburban divorce . <P> For those who want to disassemble Thurber as an eight-year-old would a broken alarm clock , the gears and springs are all here : the bow-and-arrow accident that cost him one eye at the age of six , the loopy Columbus boyhood , the insuperable Midwestern chauvinism , the sexual shyness , the days as a code clerk at the U.S. embassy in Paris , the two dozen straight rejections by The New Yorker , the friendships with Playwright-Actor Elliot Nugent and E.B. White , the odd adversary relationship with New Yorker Editor Harold Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
