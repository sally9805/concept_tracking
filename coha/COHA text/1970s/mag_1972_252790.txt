DELIVERANCE <P> Directed by JOHN BOORMAN Screenplay by JAMES DICKEY <P> For three of the four men , the trip into the wilderness is something of a lark . For Lewis ( Burt Reynolds ) it is a ritual and a trial . He tells his best friend Ed , played by Jon Voight : " Machines are gon na fail . The system 's gon na fail . And then-survival . " <P> As the men leave their safe city homes for a weekend of canoeing down a wild Georgia river , Lewis says : " They 're raping the whole goddamned landscape . " It seems that the unspoiled countryside gliding past their car windows will soon be gone , after engineers dam the river and change it into a broad , still lake . Haphazard at first , the expedition soon becomes a horror . It is nature in all its untamable force that finally rapes man . <P> There is a sense of uneasiness from the outset . Bobby ( Ned Beatty ) , fattest and least fit of the group , takes one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think this is where everything finishes up . " The country folk are suspicious , violent , many inbred to the point of idiocy . They watch the city men like weasels guarding a burrow . <P> The river , nature itself , is seen as a malign force . At first , shooting some easy rapids gives the men a small sense of triumph . " We beat it , we beat it , did n't we ? " Ed shouts . Lewis knows better . " You do n't beat it , " he says evenly . " You do n't beat this river . " Next day , the river separates the men for a time . Ed and Bobby go ashore and are set upon by two mountaineers . Ed is tied to a tree , Bobby sodomized at gunpoint . They are only saved from further humiliation by the arrival of Lewis , who kills one of the mountain men with a bow and arrow while the other runs off . <P> The canoeists have grown gradually more isolated from their smug idea of civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain . Drew ( Ronny Cox ) , the most rational of the four , wants to bring the murdered mountaineer downriver to the police . He believes that they will all be pardoned for justifiable homicide . The others doubt it , finally overrule him , and bury the body in the woods , which along with the rest of the area will be flooded for the dam project . <P> As they set off again , Drew falls from his canoe and is lost in the roiling water . Then Lewis spills out in rapids and suffers a bad break in his leg . It is up to Ed , the most hesitant of them , to save Bobby and the crippled Lewis . To do this , he must become an animal , beginning by scaling a high cliff and killing the mountaineer who may be waiting for them in ambush . <P> The film that John Boorman has fashioned from James Dickey 's novel is a magnificent visual experience and an assault on the senses fully as brutal as the river trip .

Deliverance is splendidly photographed ( by Vilmos Zsigmond ) and edited ( by Tom Priestley ) . Images sweep by the eye in great , violent cascades that transcend Dickey 's prose renderings of the same terrain .
