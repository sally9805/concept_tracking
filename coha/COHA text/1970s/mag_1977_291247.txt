UNIONS U.S.W. Brawla , U.A.W. Harmony <P> The leadership posts in major unions are among the most powerful positions in the U.S. , coveted by a host of aspirants . But there is no one way to win them , as the diametrically opposed situations in two giant unions illustrate . The 1.4 million-member United Steelworkers is enmeshed in a mudslinging , red-baiting election campaign , while the United Auto Workers , also 1.4 million strong , last week effectively chose a new chief in an atmosphere of total harmony . Details : <P> Sadlowski v. McBride <P> Both are Steelworkers , and both are running for the presidency of the United Steelworkers of America , the largest union in the AFL-CIO . There ends all similarity between Ed Sadlowski and Lloyd McBride . Sadlowski is 38 , a scrappy Pole , a third-generation " mill rat " who feels that U.S.W. 's leadership is too close to employers and too distant from the rank and file . McBride is balding , 60 , grandfatherly , a lackluster speaker , a defender of the status quo-and the apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sadlowski does not : the backing of I.W. Abel , who retires in June as the union 's $75,000-a-year president . <P> Not since 1965 , when Abel defeated David McDonald by a gossamer 10,000 votes , has the contest for the 1.4 million-man union 's top job been so embittered . Since last fall , when Sadlowski announced his candidacy ( TIME , Sept. 20 ) , both sides have traded vicious verbal blows , and sometimes physical ones : a Sadlowski volunteer was shot through the neck while handing out leaflets in Houston . The battle has spilled over into the courts . Three weeks ago , McBride filed a suit charging that Sadlowski had received illegal campaign contributions from employers in other industries ; last week Sadlowski countered by filing a libel suit against McBride . <P> The contest will end Feb. 8 , when the union 's members cast ballots in 5,360 U.S.W. local halls in the U.S. and Canada . Officials of the U.S. Department of Labor will tally the vote in Pittsburgh and announce the winner . That falls short of Sadlowski 's demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraud . His fear of chicanery is understandable ; in 1973 he ran for the job of U.S.W. district director in Chicago and Gary and was originally declared the loser . But under Government supervision the election was rerun and Sadlowski won by 2 to 1 . <P> The Abel-McBride forces charge Sadlowski with radicalism . McBride is careful not to call Sadlowski a Communist . " I do n't really know whether he is or is n't a Communist , " McBride said at a Pittsburgh rally last week . " But I do know he 's in bed with left-wingers . " <P> Sadlowski has the backing of Ralph Nader , Victor Reuther ( brother of the late Walter ) , liberal Economist John Kenneth Galbraith and General Motors Heir Stewart Mott , who gives money to liberal causes . Most established labor chiefs , like George Meany , head of the AFL-CIO , oppose Sadlowski.
