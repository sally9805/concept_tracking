When Billy Adler and John Margolies were growing up in suburbia , their fathers wanted them to go into law or business . But Billy and John , now 26 , decided : no way . Why ? It was because of TV , Margolies says . TV turned them off anything that involved reading and on to entirely new ways of looking at life that their fathers never knew . Billy and John did read Marshall McLuhan , however , and earned their master 's degrees in communications . They dabbled in teaching , ad copywriting , architecture criticism and still photography . <P> Eighteen months ago the two found their real calling . Convinced that the " visual reality of commercial television " had become " the most important force in the country , " they formed a company called Telethon to document that reality off the TV screen . Telethon 's first big project is a traveling show called The Television Environment-a thoroughly engaging , nonstop bombardment of slides and live TV that is currently playing at art museums in Vancouver , B.C. , Berkeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore . <P> Trivia Games . Basically a twelve-projector magic-lantern show , Television Environment flashes freeze frames of evocative TV vignettes round the walls of the gallery : Arlene Francis blindfolded . A masked Lone Ranger . Premier Kosygin . Indistinguishable beauty contest winners . Teddy Kennedy delivering his Chappaquiddick apologia . Truth or Consequences . David Susskind . Moon shots . Spiro Agnew cooking linguini with Dinah Shore . Mr. Ed . Fulton Sheen . A sportscast logo . Truman Capote . General Westmoreland with Ed Sullivan . Perry Como . U Thant , Joe Namath , and so on , for a total of 1,000 slides that are continuously seen on the walls from museum opening to closing . Simultaneously , four TV sets in the corners of the gallery carry live local channels to relate the " art " to " life . " <P> The show may be less pop art than pap art , but it does for TV what Andy Warhol did for Campbell 's soup . " Museums have the responsibility of helping us to understand the visual environment around us , " explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in visual perception-letting you look at the same thing you have seen before but in a different way so you can think about yourself and how you perceive it . " Children and museum guards tend to cluster in the corners to watch the on-the-air programming . Adults are variously befuddled , bemused or transfixed into playing trivia identification games ( " Dammit , who was Jackie Gleason 's wife in the original Honey-mooners ? " ) . Some visitors consider the show out of place in a museum , but most have to admit that this is their life .
