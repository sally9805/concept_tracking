Mark snaps on slide of Cheryl : young , fragile , thin , hair flowing , quintessentially innocent . MARK This is a picture of my wife before . ( Lights up on Cheryl , six months pregnant , heavy , rigid . ) This is her now.She 's been through a lot . ( Mark snaps on photographic portrait of himself . Face gentle . Halo of light around head . ) This is a portrait Nadine made of me . ( Lights up on Nadine . ) This is Nadine . ( Lights out on Nadine . Snaps on slide of marine boot and leg just below the knee . ) This is a picture of my foot.I wanted a picture of it because if I ever lost it , I wanted to remember what it looked like . ( He laughs , Fade-out . ) II CHERYL If I thought about this too much I 'd go crazy.So I do n't think about it much.I 'm not too good with the past.Now , Mark , he remembers.That 's his problem.I do n't know whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know.Divorce means a lot of nasty thingslike it 's over.It says a lot likeOh yeah . I been there . I 'm a divorcee Geez.You could go on forever about that thing. I gave up on it . No.You know , I was n't willing to give up on it , and I should have , for my own damn good . You look:It 's all over now , it 's everywhere.There are so many men like him now . You do n't have to look far to see howsucked in you can get . You got a fifty-fifty chance . p. 3 III NADINE When I first met Mark , it was the big stuff.Loss of ego , we shared everything . The first two hours I spent with him and what Ithoughtthen is what I think now , and I know just abouteverythingthere is to know , possibly . He told me about it all the first week I met him.We were discussing alcoholism.I 'm very close to that myself.He said that one of his major projectswas to face all the relationships he 'd been inwhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so honest he does n't hide anything . He told me he beat her very badly.He does n't know if he can recover that relationship . I 've met his wife. I do n't know her . I sometimes even forget He 's the greatest man I 've ever known.I 'm still watching him . We 're racing . It 's very wild.No one 's gaming.There are no expectations.You have a foundation for a lifelong relationship.He ca n't disappoint me . Men have been wonderful to me , but I 've never been treated like this.All these  --  yes , all these men  --  businessmen , politicians , artists , patriarchs  --  none ofthem , no one has ever demonstrated this to me . He 's beyond consideration.I have him under a microscope.I ca n't be fooled.I know what natural means.I know when somebody 's studyingI 've been around a long time.I 'm forty-three years old.I 'm not used to being treated like this . I do n't know . I 'm being honored , cherished , cared about.Maybe this is how everybody 's treated and I 've missed out . ( Laughs. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life was How I would act under combat ? That would be who I was as a man . I read my Hemingway.You know The point is , you do n't need to go through it . I would break both my son 's legsbefore I let him go through it . CHERYL I 'm telling you  --  if I thought about this , I 'd go crazy.So I do n't think about it . MARK ( To Cheryl ) : I know I did things to you , Cheryl.But you took it. I 'm sorry.How many times can I say I 'm sorry to you ? ( To audience ) I 've , uh , I 've , uh , hurt my wife . NADINE He is incredibly gentle . It 's madness to be treated this way . I do n't need it . It 's great without it . CHERYL He blames it all on the war but I want to tell youdo n't let him . MARK My wife has come close to death a number of times , but uh NADINE Maybe he 's in awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do n't know if you 're supposed to , but I do.Maybe I 'm too against his artist world , but Mark just gets into troublewhen he 's into that art world . p. 5 NADINE ( Laughing ) : Maybe he 's this way to his mother . CHERYL One day I went into the basement to take my clothesout of the washer , Jesus I have to clean out that basement , and I came across this jar NADINE Especially from a guy who 's done all these dastardly deeds . CHERYL He had a naked picture of me in there.cut out to the form , tied to a stake with a string.And there was all this broken glass , and I know Mark.Broken glass is a symbol of fire . ( Thinking ) What else did he have at the bottom ? NADINE I accept everything he 's done . CHERYL Yeah , there was a razor blade in there and some old negatives of the blood stuff , I think.I mean , that was so violent.That jar to me , scared me.That jar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've done.He 's burning me at the stake like Joan of Arc.It just blew my mind . NADINE Those jars he makes are brilliant , humorous.He 's preserving the war . I 'm intrigued that people think he 's violent.I know all his stories.He calls himself a time bomb.But so are you , are n't you ? p. 6 MARK I do n't know what it would be for women.What war is for men.I 've thought about it A lot.I saw women brutalized in the war . I look at what I 've done to my wife . CHERYL He keeps telling me : He 's a murderer.I got ta believe he can be a husband . MARK The truth of it is , it 's different from what we 've heard about war before . NADINE He 's just more angry than any of us.He 's been fighting for years.Fighting the priests , fighting all of them . MARK I do n't want this to come off as a combat story . CHERYL Well , a lot of things happened that I could n't handle . MARK It 's a tragedy is what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHERYL But not too , you know , not anythingdangerous or anything like that  --  just crazy things . NADINE I guess all my friends are angry . CHERYL But , uh , I do n't know.It 's really hard for me to bring back those years . p. 7 NADINE Mark 's just been demonstrating it , by picking upweapons , leading a group of men . CHERYL Really hard for me to bring back those years . MARK My brother He has a whole bunch of doubts now , thinking , " Well I wonder what I 'd doif I were in a fight . " And you do n't need to go through that shit.It 's bullshit.It just chews people up . NADINE Leading a whole group into group sex , vandalism , theft.That 's not uncommon in our culture . MARK You go into a VFW hall , that 's all men talk about.Their trips on the war . NADINE I do n't know anyone who cares so much about his parents . He 's trying to save them.Like he sent home this bone of a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to listen , about the war . MARK I ca n't talk to these guys.There 's just no communication.But we just know.We look and we know . p. 8 NADINE See , he 's testing everyone all the time.In very subtle ways.He ca n't believe I 'm not shocked.I think that intrigues him . CHERYL Oh . I do n't know. I want it suppressed as fast as possible . NADINE He laughed at me once.He 'd just told a whole raft of stories.He said : " Anyone who understands all thisnaughtinessmust have been pretty naughty themselves . " Which is a pretty simplistic way of saying we can alldo it . MARK I thought:If I gave you the information , I could n't wash my hands of the guilt , because I did things over there.We all did . CHERYL I would do anything to help suppress it . MARK ( Quietly to audience ) : We all did . NADINE You know what war is for women ? A friend of mine sent me this line:I 'd rather go into battle three times than give birthonce.She said Medea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark . He laughed for days . p. 9 MARK When Cheryl , uh , my wife and I first met , I 'd just come back from ' Nam.I was so frightened of her.She had this long hair and she was really thin.I just thought she was really , uh , really American . NADINE Do you know I never talked with my husbandabout being pregnant ? For nine months there was something going on downthereand we never mentioned it . Ever . MARK You know , it was like I could n't talk to her . I did n't know how to respond . NADINE We completely ignored it.We were obsessed with names.We kept talking constantly about what we wouldname it. I gained fifty pounds . It was sheer ignorance.I was a good Catholic girland no one talked about such things . I never knew what that part of my body was doing . CHERYL It was my naivety.I was so naive to the whole thing , that his crazinesshad anything to do with where he 'd been.I mean , I was naive to the whole worldlet alone somebody who had just come back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we merrily got in the carand went to the hospital.They put me immediately into an operating room.I did n't even know what dilation meant.And I couldn't.I could not dilate . CHERYL See , I 'd hear a lot from his family.I worked for his father as a dental assistant.And it was all they talked about  --  Mark  --  so I had tomeet the guy . NADINE I was in agony , they knocked me out . CHERYL And I saw , I mean , I 'd open a drawer and I 'd see these pictures  --  NADINE My lungs filled up with fluid . CHERYL dead men . Men hanging . Things like that.Pictures Mark had sent back . MARK Yeah . I kept sending everything back . NADINE They had to give me a tracheotomy.My trachea was too small.They went running out of the operating room to get the right equipment.Everyone thought I was going to die . CHERYL Once he sent back a bone of a man he killed . To his mother . p. 11 MARK To my brother , not my mother . CHERYL Boy , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the room in apanic.He thought I was gone . CHERYL Now it does n't take much for that lady to freak.Very hyper . I think I 'd 've gone nuts.I think I 'd wan na take itand hit him over the head with it.You just do n't do those things.What the heck is happening to you ? I 'd say.They never asked that though.I do n't think they wanted to knowand I think they were afraid to ask . MARK I know . I really wanted them to ask . CHERYL I think they felt the sooner forgotten , the better off you 'd be . NADINE I remember leaving my body . MARK I 'll never forget that . CHERYL They did n't want to bring up a bad subject . MARK I came home from a war , walked in the door , they do n't say anything. I asked for a cup of coffee , and my mother starts bitching at me about drinkingcoffee. p. 12 NADINE I looked down at myself on that operating table and felt so free . CHERYL Your mother could n't deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember anything else . CHERYL My memory 's not as good as his.It 's like I put bad things in one halfand in time I erase them . NADINE I woke up in the hospital room with tubes in mythroat , stitches in my belly . I could barely breathe.My husband was there . He said : Have you seen thebaby ? What boby , I said.Can you believe it ? CHERYL That 's why I say there 's a lot of things , weird things , that happened to us , and I just generally put themunder the title of weird thingsand try to forget it.And to be specific , I 'm real vague on a lot of things . NADINE I never knew they were in thereand so I guess I did n't want them to come out . CHERYL I mean , my whole life has turned around since then . I mean , gosh , I got a kid and another one on the way.And I 'm thinking of climbing the social ladder.I 've got to start thinking about schools for them , and I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had to I 've wanted to change anyway . It 's really hard to bring these things back out . p. 13 NADINE For my second child , the same thing happened.By the third time aroundthey had to drag me out of the car.I thought they were taking me to my death for sure . MARK Cheryl is amazing.Cheryl has always been like chief surgeon.When the shrapnel came out of my head , she would be the one to take it out . CHERYL It 's no big deal . NADINE So when people ask me about the birth of mychildren , I laugh . MARK Just like with Danny.She delivered Danny herself . NADINE My children were extracted from me . CHERYL It 's no big deal . Just like pulling teeth.Once the head comes out , there 's nothing to it . VI MARK I want to tell you what a marine is . NADINE : CHERYL : I have so much to do . Just to keep going . See , I got kids now . Just to keep my kids going . I do n't sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got to be looking out . When my kids complain about supper . For the next five years at least . I just say : I know it 's crappy food . Well , go upstairs and throw it up . When I 'm ready to look in , look out . I was in a cafe today . God , do n't get into the kid routine . It 'll do it to you every time . Because you 're getting their best interests mixed up with your best interests . And they do n't go together . I heard the funniest comment : They go together because it should be your best interest , and then their best interest . So what are you gon na do to them in the meantime ? She must be married . She spends so much money . You 're talking head trips . MARK There was this whole trip that we were really special.And our training was really hard , like this whole Spartan attitude . p. 14 CHERYL The war is the base of all our problems.He gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopno matter what he 's doing to the people around him . MARK And there was this whole thing tooI told Nadine about that really knocked me out.There was this whole ethic:You do not leave your man behind on the field.I love that . CHERYL Well , he 's usually talking more than they can handle . NADINE You know , we had two months of foreplay . MARK I came to a point in there:Okay , you 're here , there 's no escape , you 're going toget taken , it 's all right to commit suicide.And it was as rational as that . We came across a hit at night , we got ambushed , it was a black guy walking point , and you know , bang , bang , bang.You walk into it . It was a surprise . Well , they got this black guy.And they took his body and we found him about aweek later CHERYL People start getting really uncomfortable , and you can see it in his eyes , the excitement . p. 15 NADINE The first time I met Mark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think anything about him at first . ( I 've never been attracted to younger men . ) But he seemed to know what he was doing . CHERYL It 's almost like there 's fire in his eyes . MARK And they had him tied to a palm tree , and his balls were in his mouth.They 'd opened up his stomach and it had been pulledout.And I knew NADINE I saw some of his work . MARK Nobody was going to do that to me . NADINE Some of the blood photography I think . MARK Better for me to rationalize suicidebecause I did n't wantthat.I do n't know . CHERYL It bothers me because it 's better left forgotten.It 's just stirring up clear water . NADINE We talked and I left . But I felt strange . MARK R. J. was my best friend over there . He and I got into a whole weird trip.We found ourselves competing against one another , setting up ambushes , getting people on kills and things , being the best at it we could . p. 16 NADINE All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said : " You want a cup of tea ? " I was in a hurry , ( I 'm always in a hurry ) but I said , " Sure , " and we went to a tea shop . ( Laughs . ) MARK R. J. is dead.He got killed in a bank robbery in Chicago . ( He was one of the few friends of mine who survivedthe war . ) NADINE Two hours later , we got up from the table. I 'm telling you , neither of us could stand up.We were gasping for breath . MARK See , I got all these people involved in a Far East smuggling scam when we got back , and then it all fell apartand we were waiting to get arrested . The smack got stashed in this car that was being heldin a custody lot.Everyone was afraid to go get it.So I decided to get it. I did this whole trip Thanksgiving weekend.I crawled in there , stole the tires off the car that were loaded with the smack.I had R. J. help me.We were doing the war all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 17 NADINE We had said it all in two hours.What I thought then is what I think nowand I think I know everything there is to know . We must have looked pretty funny staggering out of there . MARK I heard from one guy on a regular basis , maybe oncea year.He was green to Vietnam.We were getting intosome real heavy contact that Christmas.It was late at night , the VC went to uswhile we were sleeping.They just threw grenades in on us.The explosion came , I threw this kid in a bush.All I did was grab him down , and he got a medical out of there. But he feels I saved his life . NADINE When we got out onto the street we said good-byebut we both knew that our whole lives had changed . CHERYL I know he has other women . I do n't know who they are.At this point I do n't really care.I have a child to think aboutand just getting by every day . NADINE We used to meet and talk.We 'd meet in the plaza and talk.We 'd go for rides in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of times people break up.And then the man goes on to the next one.And you hear the guy say : " Oh , my wife was crazy . " Or something like that . " She could n't take it . " NADINE Sometimes we 'd be driving , we 'd have to stop the car and get our breaths.We were dizzy , we were gasping for breath , just from being together . CHERYL But the important question to ask is : Why is she crazy ? MARK So he wants to see me.I have n't been able to see him . CHERYL My brother is a prime example.He nearly killed his wife a number of times.She was a real high-strung person.She snapped.The family keeps saying , oh , poor Marge , she was socrazy . MARK He was only in the bush maybe five , six weeks , but it did something to him. He spent two years , he wrote me a letter , in a mental institution.I do n't know . I knew he knew what I knew . CHERYL My brother 's now got one little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother p. 19 MARK I know who 's been there. And they know . CHERYL And then saw her mother come after her . MARK But in a sense we want to be as far awayfrom each other as possible.It 's become a personal thing . The guilt.There is the guilt.It 's getting off on having all that power every day.Because it was so nice.I mean , it was power NADINE You know they 're doing surveys now , medical research on this . MARK I had the power of life and death . NADINE They think something actually changesin the blood or the lungs when you feel this way . CHERYL I 'm sorry . They were married too longfor it just to have been Marge . MARK I 'm sitting here now deep down thinking about it NADINE You watch . Soon there 'll be a science of love , and there should be . CHERYL When someone goes so-called crazy in a marriage , I always think:It takes two . p. 20 MARK It 's like the best dope you 've ever had , the best sex you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was the most beautiful feeling of my life . CHERYL My brother 's on to a new woman now . MARK You never find anything better.And that 's not something you 're supposed to feel good about . CHERYL If Mark and I split up , I pity the next one . MARK I have n't told you what a marine is yet . CHERYL Women should warn each other . ( Pause . ) NADINE Everything Mark did was justified.We 've all done it.Murdered someone we loved , or ourselves . MARK I mean , we were trained to do one thing.That 's the one thing about the marines.We were trained to kill . NADINE This is hard to say.I have been in the jungle so long , that even with intimates , I protect myself.But I know that Mark felt good killing.When he told me that I did n't bat an eye.I understand . p. 21 CHERYL Look , I think Mark and R. J. were close only because they both got off on the war.And I think they were the only two over there thatdid.Does n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men do n't talk like that , when they get together to reminisce.They do n't talk about getting laid and dope.Imagine getting together with your best girlfriendand talking about what it was like the night before inthe sack.That grosses me out . NADINE I judge everyone so harshlythat it is pretty ironicthat I 'm not moved by anything he tells me.I 'm not changed . I 'm not shocked.I 'm not offended . And he must see that . MARK I had the power of life and death.I wrote home to my brother.I wrote him , I told him. I wrote:I dug it . I enjoyed it. I really enjoyed it . NADINE I understand because I 'm convinced that I am even angrier than Mark.I went off in a different direction , that 's all . CHERYL Now I do n't think Mark and R. J. were rare.I think the degree is rare.I mean men would not be going on fighting like thisfor centuries if there was n't something besideshaving to do it for their country.It has to be something like Mark says.I mean he said it was like orgasm . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can take that remark.But what better explanation can you want ? And believe me , that is Mark 's definition of glory.Orgasm is glory to Mark . p. 22 MARK I talked with R. J. about it. He got into a hit once at about 8:30 at night.And there was this " person " laying down , wounded , holding on to a grenade . ( It was a high contact . ) We watched R. J. walk over and he just shot the person in the face . He knew it.As incredibly civilized as we are in this room , these things go on . NADINE Until you know a lot of Catholicsyou ca n't understand what hate means.I mean I 'm a I was a Catholic.And Catholics have every right to hate like they do.It requires a whole lifetimeto undo what that training does to them . MARK It 's getting hard to talk.Obviously , I need to tell it , but I do n't want to be seen as a monster . NADINE Just start talking to Catholicswho allow themselves to talk.It 's unspeakable what 's been done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their table mannersto their sexuality . It 's just terrible . MARK I 'm just moving through society now . ( Pause. ) p. 23 VIII NADINE I mean my definition of sophisticationis the inability to be surprised by anything . MARK I look at my face in a mirror , I look at my hand , and I can not believe I did these things . CHERYL Mark 's hit me before . MARK See , I see the war now through my wife.She 's a casualty too.She does n't get benefits for combat duties.The war busted me up , I busted up my wife CHERYL He 's hit me more than once . MARK I mean I 've hit my wife . NADINE Have you ever been drunk for a long period of time ? MARK But I was always drunk . NADINE Well , I have . MARK We were always drunk . It would boil out , the anger , when we were drunk . NADINE I used to drink a lotand did vicious things when I was drunk.And until you 're there , you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found out what I 'd done to her.It was I just could n't stop . CHERYL I was really into speed  --  oh , how many years ago ? I 'm not good with the past.I mean Mark knows dates and years.God I do n't know . MARK It 's like I feel terrible about it.The last time it happenedit was about a year ago now.I made up my mind to quit drinkingbecause drinking 's what 's brought it on . CHERYL We got into some kind of argument about speed.And he pushed me down the stairs.He hit me a couple of times . NADINE Yeah it 's there and it takes years.My husband and I weregrooving on our fights.I mean really creative.And five years ago we got down to the count.Where we were batting each other around.Okay , I hit my husband . A lot.See , I 'm capable of it . MARK I dropped out of AA.I put the cork in the bottle myself . NADINE Okay  --  I really was drunk , really mad.And I beat him up and do you know what he said tome ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I did n't know you cared that much . " It was the most incredible thing.And he stood there and held his faceand took itand turned around in a state of glory and said : " I did n't think you cared . " I 'll never hit another person again . p. 25 CHERYL I went to the hospital'cause my ribs I think , I do n't know. I do n't remember it real clearly.It had something to do with speed.The fact that I was n't , I was , I was n't rational.No , I must have really tore into him. I mean I can be nasty.So anyway that was hard because I could n't go toworkfor a couple of weeks . NADINE And I see Mark.The fact that he beat his wife. I understand it. I do n't like it.But I understand it . MARK I 've been sober so long now , it 's terrifying . See , I really got into photography while I wasdrunk.Got involved in the art program at the U.I mean I could be fineand then the wrong thing would come upand it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark . MARK I 'd space out and start talking about the war.See , most of these peopledid n't have to deal with it.They all dealt with the other side . NADINE I was " antiwar , " I marched , I was " nonviolent . " ( Laughs. ) p. 26 MARK I brought some photos.This is a picture of some people who at one point intimewere in my unit . That is , they were there at the time the photo was taken.Some of them are dead , some of them made ithome , ( Pause. ) some of them are dead now . NADINE But I 'm capable of it . MARK After I was there , I could never move with people who were against the war in a real way . It took a part of our life.I knew what it was and they did n't . NADINE We all are . MARK They could get as pissed off as they wanted toI did n't fight with them.I did n't bitch with them.I just shut up . Excuse me . ( Looks at audience . Sees or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moment of murderous anger . He shuts up and exits . ) IX CHERYL I 'm scared knowing that I have to keep my mouthshut.I do n't know this for a fact , but I meanI fantasize a lot.I have to.I 've got nothing else to do.See , I 've got no real line of communication at all , on this issue.If I ever told him I was scared for my life , he 'd freakout.If I ever said anything like that , how would he react ? Would he get angry ? What do you think ? Do I want to take that chance ? I got too much to lose.Before , you know , when we were just single together , I had nothing to lose . I have a little boy here . And if I ever caught Mark hurting meor that little boy again , I 'd kill him.And I do n't wan na be up for manslaughter . Danny means more to me than Mark does.Only because of what Mark does to me.He does n't realize it maybe , but he squelches me . God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of my lifewith two kids . And I ca n't rob my children of whatlittle father they could have . p. 27 NADINE I 've always understood how people could hurt each otherwith weapons . If you 've been hurt to the quick , and a weapon 's around , WHAP . I signed my divorce papers becauselast time he came over , I knew ifthere 'd been a gun around , I'd'vekilled him . ( Mark enters ) @x ( Laughing ) : I told him his face is a dangerous weapon.He ought to be real responsible with it . CHERYL All his jars NADINE I think we 'd only known each other for a week and Isaid:You should really have a license for that face . MARK That 's my friend , that 's R. J.My friend R. J. used to carry a machete.I do n't know why he never did it.But he always wanted to cut somebody 's head off . p. 32 NADINE You know why they went crazy out there ? It 's that totally negative religion.It makes you fit to kill.Those commandments MARK He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a village . NADINE Every one of them " Thou shalt not . " MARK It was an abuse of the dead.We got very sacred about taking the dead . NADINE Take an infant and start him out on the whole worldwithThou shalt notand you 're perpetually in a state of guiltor a state of revolt . MARK There 's a whole Buddhist ceremony . R. J. , everybody  --  got pissed off.He wanted to let them know . CHERYL But he 's got an imagination MARK I never saw our guys rape women . I heard about it . CHERYL And it 's usually sexually orientated somehow . MARK But you never took prisoners , so you 'd have to getinvolved with them while they were dyingor you 'd wait until they were dead . p. 33 CHERYL Everything Mark does is sexually orientated . MARK The Vietnamese got into that.There was this one instance I told you aboutwhere R. J. shot the person in the face it was a woman . CHERYL I do n't know why we got together . MARK The Vietnamese carried that body back.It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHERYL When I think back on it , he was weird , off the war . MARK It was their spoils.They could do what they wanted . NADINE So you send these guys out thereall their lives they 've been listening to nuns and priestsand they start learning to kill . ( Mark snaps on picture of him with medal . Full dress . ) MARK This is a picture of my first Purple Heart . NADINE Sure Mark felt great . I understand that.His senses were finally alive . CHERYL His Purple Hearts never got to me.I was never impressed with the fighting man , I do n't think . p. 34 MARK A lot of people bullshitted that warfor a lot of Purple Hearts.I heard about a guy who was in the rearwho went to a whorehouse.He got cut up or something like that.And he did n't want to pay the womanor something like that.He ended up with a Purple Heart . CHERYL Well , drugs helped , a lot.We did n't have much in common . MARK I do n't know . We were out in the bush.To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were wounded and you bled.You were hurt during a contact.I did n't feel anything getting it.But I wanted a picture of it . CHERYL I mean , I 've got to get that basement cleaned out . MARK Actually , I was pissed off about getting that medal . CHERYL My little boy 's getting curious . MARK There were South Vietnamese who were sent out with us , fought with us .

She 's come through timeswhen I got to the very edge of suicide.She 's helped me through a couple of timesthat without her help I 'd be dead.Now , I 've been very honest with Nadineexcept when she asked me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even think about suicide . IV THE SPAGHETTI STORY CHERYL I hate to cook.Probably because he likes to cook.I hate to cook.I do n't know how to cook , and I hate it . Mark does this spaghetti dinner once a year.Has he ever told you about that ? Holy Christ ! MARK Excuse me . ( Leaves. ) p. 66 CHERYL Every day before ThanksgivingMark does a spaghetti dinner , and thisis a traditional thing.This is the one traditional bone Mark has in his body , and I 'd like to break it . He has twenty to forty-five people come to this thing.He makes ravioli , lasagna , spaghetti , meatballs , three different kinds of spaghetti sauce:shrimp , plain , meat sauce.Oh , he makes gnocchi ! He makes his own noodles ! And it 's good.He 's a damn good cook for Italian food.But you can imagine what I go throughfor three weeks for that partyto feed forty people.Sit-down dinner.He insists it 's a sit-down dinner.So here I am running aroundwith no time to cook with him. I 'm trying to get enough shit in my houseto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did not have enough room to seat fortypeople.And I run around serving all these slobs , and this is the first year he 's really charged anyone.And we lose on it every year.I mean , we lose , first year we lost three hundred dollars.This dinner is a five-hundred-dollar deal.I 'm having a baby this November , and if he thinks he 's havingany kind of spaghetti dinner , he can get his butt out of here.I ca n't take it . Pizzas ! He makes homemade pizzas.You should see my oven.Oh my God ! There 's pizza shit everywhere.Baked on.And when it 's over with , he just gets up and walks out.He 's just done.The cleanup is no big deal to him. He wo n't even help.He rolls up the carpets for this dinner.People get smashed ! He 's got wine everywhere , red wine.It has to be red so if it gets on my rugs , my rugs are ruined and my couch is ruined.I 've just said it so many times I hate it. He knows I hate it . My brother brought over some speedto get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitalist  --  intelligent  --  makes me sick.Never got into drugs . Was too old.Missed that whole scene.But he now has speed occasionallyon his bad day , you know , drink , two drinks onenight , speed to get him through the day.Businessman . He brought me some speed to get me through thenight'cause he knew what a basket case I 'd be . And then Mark goes and invites my family.And they 're the last people I want to see at this.Sure , they love it . I mean , they all sit around and theystuff themselves to death.I 'm not kidding ! It is one big stuffing feast . The first time , the first spaghetti dinner we had was right after Danny was born.Danny 's baby book got torn up. I had to start a whole new one.Mark 's crazy friends.Drunk.Broken dishes everywhere.I 'm not kidding.It 's just a disaster . Spaghetti on the walls.Spaghetti pots dropped in the kitchen.Spaghetti all over the sink . That 's why I ask him. I go : " Why ? " " It 's traditional . I have to do this every year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm telling you. I mean , he wonders why I ca n't sleep with himsometimes.Because I just work up such a hate for him insidethat ( Mark enters . ) I 'm a perfectionist.My house has to be this way , and before I go to sleep , I 'll pick up after him. I 'm constantly picking up after him.Christ Almighty ! In the morning , if he comes in late , he 's read the newspaper and there 's newspaper all over the room.He throws it when he 's done with it. I 've broken toes on his shoes.I broke this toe on his shoes.He always leaves his shoes right out in walking space.Every morning I trip oneither his tennis or his good shoes.Whichever pair he does n't have on.He 's so inconsiderate of other people.He 's so selfish , he 's so self-centered.And this is what I tell him. I 'm just tired of it. He 's so selfish.Because this spaghetti dinner just ruins me.Baby or no baby , it just completely ruins me.And he 's showing off his , his wonderful cooking that he does once a year.And I suppose this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows us slide of wounded children . MARK This is a picture of some kids who were hurt.I used to take care of them , change their bandages and shit.I loved these kids . Oh , God VI CHERYL What am I gon na do ? I mean , someday Danny 's gon na have to see Markfor what he is.And that just scares the piss right out of me . NADINE How do you tell your children their father is an asshole ? CHERYL I do n't wan na be here when Mark tells Dannyabout the war . I do n't trust him . NADINE How could I tell my children that their father isin town and has n't called ? CHERYL I do n't trust what he 's gon na tell the kid.And the way I wan na bring the kid up , you ca n't tell him anything . NADINE You ca n't tell your kidsthey ca n't have something they wantbecause their father has squandered their money . CHERYL You 're just better off not saying anything . p. 68 NADINE What 'm I going to do , tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them ? CHERYL I 'm just , you know , when that sort of thing comes along , I live from day to day . NADINE The counselors tell me and my lawyers tell me that I should stop protecting them from him. But it 's hard enough , do n't you think ? They hurt enough already . CHERYL Later on , you know  --  there might not be a war going on.I might not have to deal with that.And maybe someday I can explain to him . NADINE One time I told them he was in townbecause I could n't find a wayto cover up the fact that I knew.They were depressed for weeks.I have to protect them . CHERYL ( Angry ) : See , why do I have to do all this ? ? ? ? And I do. I find myself doing everything.Covering for him NADINE I do n't protect Mark.He does n't need it. He judges himself all the time , he 's devoted to his son . p. 69 CHERYL Sure Mark plays with him. But when it comes to discipline , that kid 's a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to discipline . NADINE He works hard at his shop . He is supporting his family . CHERYL He 's never around . NADINE He is working his way back into society . He 's beginning to believe in himself and do his work . CHERYL I 'm past the sixties.I want to go back to the Church.And Mark just will not understand the importance ofthis for me.I mean , when there 's no father around , the Church shows some order , you know . NADINE He told me he 's discoveringwho he always thought he was.I think of him as an artistand a lifelong friend . VII Mark is holding the picture he has framed of the children . MARK I 'm terrified I have a son There 's another child on the way I 'm terrified for what I did now p. 70 CHERYL The war is the base of all our problems . MARK It 's guilt it 's a dumb thing it makes no sense logically but I 'm afraid there 's this karma I built upof hurting there are children involved like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . CHERYL I get so scared when he says that.I mean , I never did anything . MARK There 's no logic to it but it 's there.I try I 'm really intense with my boy . I think what we 're beginning to see here isthat it was a different world I was in.I 'd like to be real academic about this closed case but this is an ongoing struggle . NADINE Mark ! MARK I do n't know. I just do n't know.Sometimes I look at a news story.I look at something someone goes to prison for here , I think about it.There 's no difference.It 's just a different place.This country had all these rules and regulationsand then all of a sudden they removed these things . Then you came back and try to make your lifein that society where you had to deal with them.You find that if you violate them , which I found , you go to jail , which I did.I sit back here sometimes and watch the news , watch my mother , watch my father.My parents watch the news and say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there and started shooting and killed all those people.They ought to execute him . " I look at them.I want to say , " Hell , what the fuck , why did n't you ever listen You want to hear what I did ? " It 's real confusionI 'm guilty and I 'm not guilty.I still want to tell my folks.I need to tell them what I did . p. 71 VIII CHERYL There was a time when a man would confess to me , " I 'm a jerk , " at a private momentand I would smilesweetlyand try to comfort him . Now I believe him . IX THE CONFESSION MARK I I killed three children , a mother and father incold blood . ( Crying . ) CHERYL Do n't . MARK I killed three children , a mother and father ( Long pause . ) NADINE Mark . MARK I killed them with a pistol in front of a lot of people . I demanded something from the parents and thensystematically destroyed them.And that 's that 's the heaviest part of what I 'm carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowabout it , my wife knows about it , Nadine knows about it , and nobody else knows about it.For the rest of my life I have a son He 's going to die for what I 've done.This is what I 'm carrying around ; that 's what this logic is about with my children . A friend hit a booby trap.And these people knew about it. I knew they knew.I knew that they were working with the VCinfrastructure.I demanded that they tell me.They would n't say anything. I just wanted them to confess before I killed them.And they would n't . So I killed their childrenand then I killed them . I was angry.I was angry with all the power I had.I could n't beat them.They beat me . ( Crying . ) I lost friends in my unit I did wrong.People in the unit watched me kill them.Some of them tried to stop me.I do n't know. I ca n't . Oh , God A certain amount of stinkwent all the way back to the rear.I almost got into a certain amount of trouble . It was all rationalized , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew had a part in it.There was enough evidence , but it was n't a very good image to put outin terms of the marines overseas , so nothing happened . I have a child a child who passed through the agethat the little child was.My son my sonwould n't know the difference between a VC and amarine . The children were so little . I suppose I could find a rationalization . All that a person can do is try and find wordsto try and excuse me , but I know it 's the same damn thingas lining Jews up.It 's no differentthan what the Nazis did.It 's the same thing . I know that I 'm not alone.I know that other people did it , too.More people went through more hell than I did but they did n't do this . I do n't know I do n't know if it 's a terrible flaw of mine , then I guess deep down I 'm just everything that 's bad . I guess there is a rationale that saysanyone who wants to live that badand gets in that situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , I really strove to be good.I had a whole set of values.I had ' em and I didn't.I do n't know . I want to come to the pointwhere I tell myself that I 've punished myself enough . In spite of it all , I do n't want to punish myself anymore.I knew I would want to censor myself for you . I did n't want you to say:What kind of a nut , what kind of a bad person is he ? And yet , it 's all right. I 'm not gon na lie . My wife tries to censor me from people , from certain things . I ca n't watch war shows.I ca n't drive.Certain things I ca n't deal with.She has to deal with the situation , us sitting around , a car backfires , and I hit the deck . She knows about the graveyards , and R. J. and thewoman.She lives with all this still hanging out. I 'm shell-shocked. p. 72 X NADINE Well , I 'm going to look forward to the rest of my lifebecause of what I know. I ca n't wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to feel hopelesspolitically.And I 've known what it is to plungepersonally.But Mark has become a conscience for me.Through him  --  I 've come to understand the violence in myself and in him , and in all of us.And I think if we can stay aware of that , hold on to that knowledge , maybe we can protect ourselvesand come out on the other side . MARK ( Mumbling ) : I 'm just a regular guy.A lot of guys saw worse . NADINE If anything I 'm on a continuum now . MARK See , I did n't want to see peoplegoing through another era ofbeing so ignorant of the fact that war kills people . NADINE And I do n't know if it 's cynicism or just experience , but I 'm sure I 'm never gon na plungein the old way again. I 'm not saying that trying to sound tough.I know about that . I know all about that . p. 73 MARK I feel protective of our children.Once you 're out there , you know there is no justice.I do n't want the children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you have none , you 're really free.And you do n't ever plunge.What do you plunge for ? MARK It will happen again . NADINE I 'm just going to work so hard because of what Iknow.I do every day . Did I tell you about not going to sleep at nightbecause I ca n't bear to stop thinking about it all ? I 'm just going to be so busy for whatever 's left . ( But I 'm not mad at anyone . ) I do n't blame anyone.I 've forgiven everyone.God , I feel my house is in order at last . MARK I dedicate this evening to my friends I 'd like a roll call for my friends who died . NADINE There 's one other thing.When we all sit around together with our friendsand we tell womenthat no man can do it for you , we all know it 's true , but I guess for some of usit never works that way.At this point in my life , this curtain has dropped . p. 74 MARK Anderson , Robert . NADINE And we see MARK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here , questioning themselves and judging themselves  --  and us  --  like Mark . MARK Dawson , Mark . NADINE I love Mark . MARK Fogel , Barry . NADINE Well , so The material has been turning over and over . MARK Grant , Tommy . NADINE Where is it at now ? MARK Gunther , Bobby . NADINE You see . MARK Heinz , Jerry . NADINE What do you see , just a cast of characters ? MARK Jastrow , Alan.Lawrence , Gordon.Mullen , Clifford . ( Roll call continues through Cheryl 's speech , ending with a conscious decision on Mark 's part to name R. J. among the casualties of Vietnam. ) p. 75 XI CHERYL The men have it all . MARK Nelson , Raymond . CHERYL They 've had it for the longest time . MARK Nedelski , Michael . CHERYL There 's another thing I believe.There 's a lot more peoplethat are messed up because of the way we werebrought up . MARK Nevin , Daniel . CHERYL Not brought up , but the things we 've been throughsince we were brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our generation , MARK Rodriguez , Daniel . CHERYL the hippie generation , shortly before and after , are gon na be the ones that suffer . MARK Rogers , John . CHERYL Because ninety percent of the men neverstraightened out . p. 76 MARK Ryan , John . CHERYL But what I also believeis that for every woman that has her beliefs , there 's a man that matches . MARK Sawyer , Steven . CHERYL Whether you find him or not , is , is like finding a needle in a haystack . With our population , I mean , that 's the odds you have . MARK Simon , Jimmy . CHERYL And there 's the Women 's Libs.And there 's a man for them too . MARK Skanolon , John . CHERYL See , what we 're doing is crossing.We 're meeting the menthat should be with the other ones.And I truly believe that , that there is an equal balance.Even though our group is so fucked-up.And we are . MARK Spaulding , Henry . CHERYL You 'll look , you 'll go in college campuses nowand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should stay there . p. 77 MARK Stanton , Ray . CHERYL I do n't wan na see that shit come back. I did n't even get that involved in it. I got involved in it in my own little niche.But I did n't , you know , get into itin the school matter.I went two years and I had it up to here.And sure I would like to have gone on to school , but I was competing with Mark.And I 'm not , I do not like competing with someone . MARK Vechhio , Michael . CHERYL I 'm a happy-go-lucky person.I used to be anyway , before I met Mark , where you could n't depress me on the worst day.And I had a good day every day of my life . MARK Walker , ( Pause . ) CHERYL And that is the way life was gon na be for me . MARK R. J. ( Pause . ) XII Mark points to his photograph of two grapefruits , an orange , a broken egg , with a grenade in the center on a dark background . Also some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away it looks like an ordinary still life . MARK My unit got blown up.It was high contact.We got hit very , very hard.The Marine Corps sends youthis extra food , fresh fruit , bread , a rewardwhen you 've had a heavy loss . What can I say ? I am still alive  --  my friends aren't.It 's a still life.I did n't know what I was doing . ( The women 's eyes meet for the first time as lights go down. )
