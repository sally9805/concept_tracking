" There are no bad boys , " said Father Edward Flanagan as he set about building Boys Town on a swatch of Nebraska prairie back in 1917 . His goal was to establish a refuge for homeless boys , many sent to him by state welfare agencies . Over the years a stream of tattered urchins found their way along U.S. Highway 6 , which cuts through nearby Omaha , to Boys Town . In 1938 , a wind-battered waif in the movie Boys Town made the place part of American folklore . Arriving at the doorstep with an injured lad slung on his back , he announced to Father Flanagan ( Spencer Tracy , of course ) : " He ai n't heavy , Father . He 's m ' brother . " <P> Boys Town has been a legendary human success story ; what few knew until last week , however , is that it has been financially successful beyond Father Flanagan 's wildest dreams . Today the institution has more money than it knows what to do with . One measure of its wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks and bonds managed by Morgan Guaranty Trust , and is estimated to be worth at least $200 million . Compared with the endowments of universities , Father Flanagan 's Boys Home Foundation Fund would rank No. 8 , behind Harvard , Yale , Stanford , the University of Chicago , Princeton , Columbia and Cornell . Boys Town has about $286,000 in endowment for each boy ; the university with the highest endowment/student ratio is Cal Tech , at a mere $96,000 . <P> Boys Town is land rich too . Its campus is on 1,300 acres , now estimated to be worth $8,000,000 . Near by it owns another 120 acres , plus an office building in downtown Omaha ; in Iowa it owns a summer camp ; in Wyoming some ranch land . Boys Town ended 1970 with total assets of roughly $192 million . If it were an industrial corporation , these assets would rank it 372 on FORTUNE 'S list of the top 500 . <P> Where did Boys Town get all its money ? Mostly from $1 and $2 donations solicited twice a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized mailing campaign . Roughly 34 million letters go out each year explaining that Boys Town is a " City of Little Men " and that a small contribution " can help bring happiness to other homeless and unwanted boys . " It is a simple poverty-pitch appeal , hardly consonant with Boys Town 's present wealth . It was originally devised by Ted Miller , a membership solicitor for the Loyal Order of Moose , who joined Father Flanagan 's staff in 1939 after seeing the Boys Town movie . Admits Henry Lucas , Miller 's successor and a 24-year veteran of Boys Town fund raising : " We 're the envy of organizations around the country . " <P> Well they might be . In 1970 , donations to Boys Town totaled $ 17.7 million . It cost considerably less to operate the institution : many staff members are low-paid priests or nuns , building maintenance is minimal , and expansion is currently limited to one new $3,000,000 grade school . As a result , 1970 expenses for Boys Town totaled only $9,000,000-more than one-third of it spent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $6,000,000 to operate the institution . On its present basis , Boys Town no longer needs the fund-raising campaigns , since interest from the endowment is now running in the neighborhood of $6,000,000.
