If everyone eligible to compete in a PGA tournament showed up to play , it would look like Times Square on New Year 's Eve . There are 450 card-carrying eligibles who can appear at any tournament . Yet most events provide for only 156 golfers . That is bad enough , but with more players coming out of college each year and more assistant professionals eager to try the tour , a second circuit ( or even a third and a fourth ) may be needed to ease the crush . // From last January until April , when it ran out of cash , the American Golf Tour , founded by Eddie Susalla , gave the young pros hope . So anxious were they to compete that when this " mini-tour " foundered , the players pooled their money to eke out another month of play . The caravan stalled on a May afternoon in Missouri when a tornado interrupted play , and the AGT died the following week in Indiana . // In contrast , J. C. Goosie 's Space Coast mini-tour has endured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopscotching across the country , Goosie , a former PGA tour regular , decided in 1973 to schedule weekly events on the public and private courses in and around Orlando , Fla . Goosie began his fifth season on Oct. 24 ; his tournaments will run until mid-March . Goosie has produced such a golden egg that another old pro , Doug Ford , plans to go into the same business in the same area this month . Already well established in the Southwest is the National Golfers of America , which is currently holding tournaments in Scottsdale . Its tour concludes in February . Just getting underway is the circuit sponsored by the PGA of America  --  not to be confused with the PGA tour  --  which has announced that it is putting up $1 million in purse money for 24 tournaments to be held nationwide for club pros and " registered PGA apprentices . " // These tours are catering to the likes of Barry Fleming , who is 25 , blond , tanned and confident he can be a world-beater . He has financial backing . What he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big tour . // Fleming 's father managed a country club in Parkersburg , W. Va. , and at seven Barry started belting golf balls . He has n't stopped . He was a good golfer in high school and received a golf scholarship to his state university . Because he wanted to pursue the sport in earnest , he transferred from West Virginia to Florida State . " The Northern schools have a short schedule and a lot of rain , " Fleming says . " You never get to play much . I had to sit out a year but got a full scholarship at Tallahassee and played in my senior year . I got a degree in hotel management , which will be a good fallback if I start making a lot of bogeys. // " I still was n't good enough for the tour when I graduated from college , " he says , " so I chose the pro shop route . You give a few lessons , hit golf balls and play every day without spending any money . " Fleming worked at Hilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years as an assistant pro he wanted to play competitively . He has twice failed to win his PGA tour credentials , but he remains undiscouraged . He looks at the ages of pros who are still winning , men in their 40s , and is sure he has time to improve . When he found a sponsor a year ago , he left Hilton Head and played on a now-defunct Florida mini-tour . He won the first tournament he entered , taking home $800 . Then he picked up the American Golf Tour in February and played in 11 events . Although he did not make enough to cover expenses , " I was right behind the guys who were the leading money winners , " he says . " You had to finish in the top 10% each week to make expenses because the purses were so low . When the AGT went bust , we played for the $150 entry fee each guy put up . You were n't going to get rich , even if you won two or three tournaments , but I became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of conditions . As an amateur , I would be nervous on the first tee . There 's none of that now . This is a job . " // Fleming and 381 other aspirants for PGA tour cards failed last June 's test at Pinehurst , N.C. , and they make up the bulk of the group that has joined the Space Coast mini-tour in Orlando . " If they want to play , they got to come see the Goose , " J.C . says . " I got the only place where they can win and get paid immediately . " He operates by collecting entry fees , taking a small percentage and letting the pros play for the rest . The first 64 finishers earn money , with the 64th collecting $300 , which is his entry fee . Goosie rents the courses on which the 36-hole tournaments are held . He has no trouble lining up layouts ; in fact , the events are held on some of the best courses in central Florida . The reason is simple . The club is guaranteed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays for carts , practice range and clubhouse . In a two-day tournament , a club can net from $4,500 to $6,000. // A pro must sign up for a series of five tournaments and pay $1,500 . Goosie runs off four series ( or 20 tournaments ) and then pauses only long enough to gather a new group of competitors . " I got to looking at the guys going to the tour qualifying school , " Goosie says . " Most of them did n't make it . I figured if we got a small percentage of them , say 25 , and added a few other players , we had a cinch . We not only got the pros  --  and a lot more than we expected  --  but also high school kids who came down to test themselves . Figure it out . If you had a son 18 years of age , you could send him to us , give him $4,000 to sleep and eat , and send us his $6,000 entry fee . You could tell in 20 weeks if the boy could play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results , whether he should go to college , get a job in a pro shop , practice his game or whatever . This is a fine proving ground . // " When a player gets out of here , he is not a finished product , but it gives him some idea whether he 's got it or not . We have had 42 or 43 pros who have played with us and graduated to the PGA tour . We have had two or three winners on that tour in each of the last few years , men like Gary Koch and Bruce Lietzke. " // In the 1973-74 season , Goosie had trouble filling his fields , but by the second fall his events were crowded . Now there is a waiting list until January . // Goosie is the most successful mini-tour operator because he does n't shoot for the moon . Some of the scores that win money in Goosie 's tournaments are astonishingly high . A fellow in one tournament shot 159 and collected $265 . Goosie immediately sent out a mailing , advertising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a payday . " Nearly everyone in the world thinks he can shoot a pair of 80s , " Goosie says . " One-third of our field never makes a check . They would n't earn a nickel if we paid 30 places and there were only 28 players . They 'd find some way to blow . // " We bring a million dollars in cash to the Orlando area every year , yet we have a hard time getting scores in the local paper . When the American Golf Tour came here , it got headlines . The paper said it was the greatest thing in the world for golfers . " // When he started out , Eddie Susalla believed that . He gathered together investors who put up $75,000 , and the tour got a $300,000 line of credit . All of that is gone . But Susalla is undaunted . " I owe $180,000 , but that 'll be a drop in the bucket once we get going , " he says . " There is a need for another tour . " // The AGT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mo. ; and Amarillo , Texas . The players needed $300 a week to pay expenses ( never mind their entry fee of $150 ) and that took ingenuity  --  inexpensive rooms , doubling and tripling up and dining on fast food . They had to pay for carts and most of them had to buy their golf balls because only the better prospects had an arrangement with a manufacturer . // Typical was the tournament last May at River Oaks in Grandview . The Ramada Inn was headquarters and charged the golfers $13 a night for a room . The carts were $10 per two men and the lunch was free , courtesy of a local merchant and host pro Johnny Goodman , who donated $50 each . The wives took the cash to the supermarket to buy the makings for sandwiches . // Only cash was accepted for entry fees . There were no spectators except for the wives . All rulings were made on the honor system . You played the original ball , then played a provisional and later explained the circumstances to one of the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The players were undismayed by the conditions . They just wanted to play . // For all its apparent glamour , what the PGA tour is all about is Jack Nicklaus , Lee Trevino , Arnold Palmer , Tom Watson and Ben Crenshaw  --  pros whom people identify with and can root for . Tom Weiskopf is an attraction , if only to watch him walk through a sand trap or get a free drop and have it land in the water . If you were to stage an exhibition with some of the other good tour players , men like Charles Coody , Lou Graham , Jim Colbert , Andy Bean and Rik Massengale , the crowd would n't overflow a telephone booth . Let 's face it , most of the pros on the PGA tour are n't much better than the guys who missed making it . // Instead of running a school to qualify , the PGA ought to have courses in how not to be as uncharismatic as Al Geiberger . The PGA tour was there first and therefore dictates by the divine right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doug Ford believes so . " I have no idea when or how , " he says , " but there are just too many players around who want to play . And I 'm going to join Goosie in this mini-tour business . I ran a few tournaments last year as a lark and broke even . This year I 'm sure it will work . // " I figure Goosie takes 20% off the top and pays everything . He has to clear more than $25,000 a season . And , with all the work he does , it 's a fair break . The idea is to stay in one town like Orlando and not travel . The pros can live cheaper  --  get an apartment for four guys  --  eat cheaper and they are not in south Florida where everything is expensive . // " I do n't think I 'll have any trouble filling fields . Goosie has barred the PGA tour players . I think that 's wrong , but I ca n't knock Goosie ; nobody can . His fields are bigger since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a need for another tour in places we used to go to 12 or 14 years ago  --  Boston , Baltimore , Wilmington , Pittsburgh , Akron , Detroit . " // Even should the mini-tour business expand , it 's going to be increasingly tough for a kid coming out of college to make a living playing golf . Stan Wood , the longtime golf coach at USC and former president of the College Golf Coaches of America , says , " The players start younger , get better coaching in high school and in college . Ten years ago golf was a minor sport ; now it 's a major sport in college , and scholarships are plentiful . // " They play on better courses than most of the tour stops and often year round . Everyone in college golf probably wants to play on the pro tour . There are 500 schools in our program , so that adds up to 2,500 players and approximately 1,000 graduates each year . Of these , about 100 are going to make an all-out effort to play professionally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 40 good prospects each year . But they have no place to go but the PGA tour . " // Tour Commissioner Deane Beman is equally blunt . " We are in the entertainment business , " he says , " furnishing the highest level of players for the public , which pays a lot of money to come and watch . We 're not running a business to teach someone how to play the game . We furnish the opportunity for a player with skill to have a place to practice his profession . // " We have tried to subsidize the less skilled player with satellite tournaments . One year , we had 24 satellite events and it cost more than $100,000 to run these . Nobody came to watch them and we lost money . The PGA tour is for the accomplished players . We have simple rules about how to get on the tour . A second circuit would n't help us , it would only help the player . // " I think the best solution is the mini-tours . They provide a place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers and get ready to try and qualify for the tour . It costs money but so does everything else . " // So Barry Fleming and the other 381 pros who missed qualifying at Pinehurst in June will keep chasing the rainbow that ends for a few in the PGA 's pot of gold . But they are undismayed . " There is a place for a second tour , " Fleming insists , " and there are other places to go . Some of us will go to the Canadian tour . Some will go as far as Australia . And some will go back to Orlando . One way or the other , there will be casualties . " ( Goosie has a 55% turnover. ) // Just how far novice pros will go to compete was obvious the day the tornado blew through Grandview , ripping up homes and throwing buildings into the sky . Out at the River Oaks Country Club , where play had wisely been called , golfers excoriated officials about the postponement . When the temperature fell to 26 ? and the winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not one of the 100 men scheduled to play missed his tee-off time . They want to succeed even if they die trying .
