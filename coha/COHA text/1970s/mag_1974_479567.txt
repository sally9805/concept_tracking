THE BATTLE of Wounded Knee is Lilo longer Indian against white , but Indian against Indian in a civil war of murders and beatings in desolate places . Since last spring , the village of Wounded Knee has been utterly destroyed , several people have been killed under unexplained circumstances , and the violence romanticized by the American Indian Movement has fanned like brush fire across Pine Ridge Reservation , disfiguring the South Dakota landscape with the wreckage of what was once a Cause . The white- steepled church in Wounded Knee burned to the ground last July 4 . When I arrived on the reservation late in January of this year , I found its charred foundation being used as a garbage pit . Down the hill a corroded metal roof lay crumpled on the frozen ground , crushing under its weight what was left of the Wounded Knee Trading Post and Museum . Across the mud street the wind drifted through broken and abandoned houses . I had come to report on the election for the presidency of the Tribal Council , and everywhere I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become a military as well as a political campaign . Since the long siege of last spring , the Indians on the reservation had divided into opposing camps , and each faction had suffered heavy casualties on behalf of its beliefs . The conservative , so-called " law and order " faction supported the candidacy of Dick Wilson , the incumbent president and an advocate of the colonial policies of the Bureau of Indian Affairs . The revolutionary faction , associated with AIM and the staging of last year 's siege , supported Russell Means . On the wall of a back room used as a hospital by AIM , I noticed a sign that read : " The bleeding always stops if you press it hard enough . " Next to 30 this was written a formula for cleaning wounds ? one teaspoon salt , one pint water , one pint peroxide ? and next to that a diagram of the Eustachian tube , the trachea , and the stomach . I had arrived in Wounded Knee a week before the election , and I was told by Del @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that assaults with deadly weapons lately had increased by 200 percent . " And I can tell you why , " he said , leaning across a desk on which stood a statue of a man with a pot belly , a gold star , and the words " Our Marshal " printed across the base . " We made more than 2,000 arrests during the siege , and how many people do we have in jail ? Zero . Hell , if I were an Indian on this reservation I would n't worry about committing a crime . " Eastman is an Indian on the reservation , but , like many Oglala Sioux who work for the BIA , he sometimes refers to other , non-BIA Indians , as " them . " The term usually refers to AIM sympathizers , whether the radical young seduced by ATM 's violent Terri Schnitz covered last year 's siege at Wounded Knee for the Chicago Daily News and Harper's. rhetoric , or the tribal chiefs and nu icine men attracted by AIM 's call the old ways and the old tree rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turn brother against brother , motf against children . In the Crazy Ho ) Cafe , across the street from Eastma : office , AIM supporter Louis B Wound said , " We 've had a killirq week here for the last couple months . I ca n't even tell who is sho ing who anymore . " T HE NIGHT BEFORE the electio the reservation village of Pori pine , Russell Means sat among supporters in the village hall , slur banging a tribal drum . Six men around the drum with him , th Stetsons and wool-brimmed h pulled low , tooled boots with point toes tapping the wooden floor . Th chanting began in the backs of th throats , a high keen that traveled the listener 's spine . It plunged into throbbing moan and rose again , urating the smoky room . Mellie F Owl , an old Indian woman , stood fringed shawl hugged close , and gan to move in place . She beat foot twice and the movement sprc up through her body like a sw : mer rising to the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle around the roc Others joined her , until the center the room was filled with the mot of golden bodies swaying like wh in a wind . The dance was soothi rocking , hypnotic , and the faces the dancers were peaceful and pro When the dance was done , Me stood to speak . He is a tall mat over six feet ? with broad should and a sharp profile scarred by kr and bottle fights . He wore a brc leather jacket , ripped under the ri arm , and his hair , parted in the n dle , fell in two pomaded braids that he had worked on carefully that morning , using for a mirror the cracked front-door window of Siebert Young Bear 's shack . Means 's speech , read from a worn sheet of yellow paper , changed little from place to place . He promised fifteen minibuses from Detroit to provide free transportation on the reservation ; moral , financial , and legal support from foreign countries " that I ca n't name now " ; tribal cattle and a slaughtering plant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective liquor ban . All this if AIM runs the reservation . He lifted his arm with the beaded watchband and pointed at his audience : " We drink because the wacisu white man makes it hard for us . Alcoholism is a protest against white society , and an escape from tyranny and oppression . " In the eleven months since I had seen him last , his speeches had be-On to smack of the white man 's typewriter . Where he was once mute , sullen , repetitive , he now made tempting promises and grand phrases . His platform had also become schizophrenic ? a Third World rhetoric combined with programs , such as the creation of a tribal cabinet , which were embarrassing imitations of white colonial governments . What 's more , he planned to fill all the posts himself , and his first appointment , he said , would be his brother , Ted , for the position of public-relations man . But to most Indians who approved of him it did n't matter what Means said or did . To the younger Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , he had become a symbol of the old ways . That night in Porcupine , after her dance was done , Mellie Red Owl said : " We full bloods are having a hard time . Once I had a garden with corn , potatoes , wild turnips , cherries , plums , carrots , raspberries , wild tomatoes , and fresh peppermint for tea . Buffalo , moose , prairie dogs were on our land , and we cut our own fence posts and firewood . I 'd like to go back to that . AIM made me remember . I miss my house and my land . I do n't have to prostitute myself , my dance , my beliefs , my practices , for a few tourists . I am Oglala Sioux . " She tapped a finger against her chest . " We judge ourselves by what we give away , not by what we accumulate . But before AIM I almost forgot . I almost gave away my soul . " 32 T O ADHERENTS of the opposing fac- ion the dreams of Mellie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , driving on the road to Martin . Dick Wilson phrased the conservative argument with brutal clarity . " The buffalo are gone , " he said . " The fifteen yards of calico and seven long dresses are gone , the teepees are gone . I do n't want to go back to 1868 . " He drove a blue Ford pickup at ninety miles an hour , a cigarette dangling from his right hand , brown Stetson low over his eyes , bulging pink-and-tan shirt hanging over faded blue jeans . The road through the reservation was straight and fiat . Wilson sucked on his cigarette . " If radicals like Means ever got control of this reservation , " he said , " the tribal government would fall apart . The reservation would be terminated , and the state would have our land for back taxes in thirty days . " Four impeachment attempts have been made against Dick Wilson by the tribal council , mostly for misuse of funds . But he has survived them all . He has a lot of power on the reservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pine Ridge , and Dick Wilson created 500 of them . He likes to have his clout compared to that of Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago , whom he describes as " a strong leader who knows what he 's doing and holds it all together . " " Now us Indians do n't enjoy the system , " Wilson said , " hut it 's the best we got . Face it , we lost the war . It 's time we admitted it . How many nations that lose a war are given water rights , land rights ? " Throughout the week , the arguments on both sides of the election were clouded by the uneasiness of recent violence , and each faction could tell its favorite tale of probable murder . Wilson 's supporters most frequently mentioned the death of Leo Wilcox , found in his burning car on Highway 40 just beyond the Cheyenne River Bridge . When police arrived at 9:20 P.m. , they found the car , its gears in park , the driver 's window rolled down , and Leo Wilcox charred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everyone agreed , a most unusual case . The day before his death , Wilcox had talked on KOBH radio in Hot Springs , South Dakota . He had accused Russell Means of being a sec ond Fidel Castro , and AIM of beii " like a bunch of children followii someone for an all-day sucker . " W cox , fifty-one , was an ex-Marine , Indian , an administrator for the fe eral government 's food program , member of the tribal council , and strong supporter of conservative t bal president Dick Wilson . Arson investigator Joe E. Brow an Indian , took photographs of t highway area where Wilcox 's c was found . Over dinner in his apa ment several months later , he plained that by the time he arriv at the scene the Pennington Coup Sheriff 's Department had towed cox 's car seventy miles to Rapid Ci with the body in it , a mistake th has hurt the investigation . " Any ( idence of foul play was so disturb there is no way any of it could taken into court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strange fire . There vs a hell of a lot of heat in the drive seat area ? the roof was caved Yet the heat was n't nearly as inter in the back of the car . The spare t still had some air in it . Now , if y dumped an accelerant like gasoli on the driver , and then lit it , tl would create a similar effect . " Leo 's widow , Lenora , says FBI has never questioned her abc her husband . But , just in case . buried him in a waterproof cask In the living room of her comfc able home she emptied the conte of a small plastic bag onto her li out fell a copper key chain , an Ac Iron watch with the face broken gold wedding ring with two hcqshaped leaves , a broken left lens fr a pair of sunglasses , and some ash They are the debris collected fr her husband 's car . Of Russell Me : she said : " He 's mooched all his life , try to get something for nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing in a r. around a coyote . He is doing sor thing terrible to his people . If I I known how he was going to turn c I would have choked him to death his crib . " HE SUPPORTERS of Russell Me. preferred to talk about the de of Pedro Bissonette , an AIM si pathizer who was killed last Octo while resisting arrest . Bissoni grew up in a shack on Cheyei Creek , and , like many young Ind MASSACRE AT WOUNDED KNEE The sky turned deep blue , but tI clouds stayed silver . Toward dawn woke up shivering . Wilson won t election by a vote of 1,709 to 1,53 a margin close enough to guarant continued bitterness and killin When the results were announced Pine Ridge , the largest settlement the reservation , an Indian drunk wi victory and whiskey stood shoutii in the street : " I 'm one of Wilson 's goons , a I 'm proud of it , and you people the press better write about us I once , instead of about AIM . " A woman crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him : " You told me if Dick Wilson we you would n't drink anymore , a look at you . And you insulted Rt in front of everyone , just because s voted for Russell . I 'm your moth , and I 'm telling you , if things eN get cleaned up around here , I 'm t ing to be one of those on the bon of the reservation with a gun ke ( ing the whiskey out of here . " In a room filled with televisi cameras a victorious Dick Wils spoke to the assembled reporters , c of whom asked him if he felt a differently about Means now that had defeated him . " No , " Wilson said , " I 'd still F to challenge him to a fistfight . " The room fell silent , and when ; other reporter finally said , " W0 thank you , Mr. President , " eve body laughed .

Inside the coffin th was a young girl with long shiny bl ; hair . I asked a woman in the b ; room who the girl was , and the we an said the girl was fourteen years and had died of an overdose , pr ably of TB pills , and that she die know the girl 's name .
