Refitting Ph.D . ' s for the world of business <P> A Ph.D . in philosophy was once a oneway ticket to an ivy turret . No more . With declining college enrollments , fewer faculty openings , low starting salaries and little chance for tenure , college teaching has lost much of its allure . Even worse , a Mellon Foundation study estimated that by 1990 the U.S. will have a surplus of 60,000 Ph.D . ' s in the humanities . <P> What are the good doctors to do ? Dorothy Harrison , New York State Assistant Education Commissioner , and Ernest May , Chairman of Harvard 's History Department , hit on an idea : why not refit Ph.D . ' s for the business world ? " Here are a group of people with highly developed analytical skills , " says Harrison . " They can deal with all kinds of problems . " <P> So they can . Last month , 50 carefully selected Ph.D . ' s and A.B.D. 's ( all but dissertation ) completed the Careers in Business project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department of Education . The 31 men and 19 women , ages 26 to 45 , spent seven weeks attending classes at the New York University School of Business Administration , just one block from Wall Street . For many of them , teachers or students until now , the crash courses in accounting , finance , economics , law and marketing were a first exposure to the world of business . Notes Randy Lewis , 31 , a Ph.D . from the University of Texas , " What we 've all gained is confidence . " <P> They have also gained a foot in the corporate door . More than 50 companies have been interested in the program since its inception . Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities , with grants from such corporations as A T &; T , Exxon and General Motors , the program has established strong links between business and academe . Part of the mission has been to smash stereotypes . Says one Ph.D. : " It works both ways . Businessmen see us as people with no feet on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups seem to have benefited . Each program participant has had about seven job interviews , and offers are already coming in . " They are strong person- alities with leadership qualities , " observes William Machever of Sun Chemical . " This kind of wasted talent is a disaster for the United States . " Adds Morton Darrow of the Prudential Insurance Co. , " A corporation today needs people with a greater sensitivity to the world . " <P> This is exactly what many humanists want to hear . Some of the Ph.D . ' s plan to take hard-core business jobs , with the understanding that they will have to pick up technical skills . Others hope to bring their special perspectives to corporate decision making . " I 'm interested in a company 's social responsibility to its employees , its stockholders and the community , " says one woman who still has a high school teaching job . <P> All the scholars have high aspirations . " I love teaching , but being a junior administrator and lecturer is not a viable long-term career , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has taught at Harvard for the last two years . " We see ourselves with a taste for power and money . " The project supports those goals . " We want mainstream jobs for these people in channels that will take them to the top , " says Co-Director Harrison .
