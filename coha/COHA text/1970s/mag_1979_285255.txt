Sugarplums , humbug ! After covering the pre-Christmas offerings at some of the world 's finest auction houses for this week 's cover story on the " collectibles " craze , several TIME collectors had visions of something more elaborate dancing in their heads . Their Christmas lists follow . <P> Senior Writer Michael Demarest , who wrote the story on the growing rage to collect everything from Bruegels to Barbie dolls , is a traditionalist in these matters . " A Louis XV marquetry cabinet would be nice , " he says , " though I would be quite content to receive a second painting by Jack Yeats Poet William Butler Yeats ' brother to go with the one I have . " Demarest began covering the auction scene-and , inevitably , acquiring some treasures for himself-while stationed in TIME 'S London bureau from 1958 to 1961 . " It was convenient , " he says , " and I got very good advice . Sotheby 's was around the corner from our offices , and its chairman , Peter Wilson , used to lunch at TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewed the owners and patrons of Manhattan 's top auction houses , shares Demarest 's taste for fine art . " Chinese lacquer chests interest me , and so do impressionist paintings . I would n't mind getting a Renoir for Christmas . It can be a very small one . " <P> Some of those who worked on the story were knowledgeably specific in their selections . " An intact Jaipur vase to replace one cracked en route from the Far East , " requests Chicago Orientalia Buff Pat Delaney , who covered the Midwest auction scene . Erik Amfitheatrof , who interviewed directors of Sotheby 's and Christie 's in London-and who began buying Japanese art while reporting from Tokyo in the 1960s-dreams of finding the Hiroshige print White Rain at Shono under his Christmas tree . " Alas , my chances are slim , " he admits . " It was auctioned at Christie 's New York this year for $13,000 . " But no art , thank you , for Art Critic Robert Hughes , who wrote this week 's Essay on collecting . Says Hughes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Picassos : " I 'll accept anything anybody chooses to give me , except unsolicited artwork . " <P> Meanwhile , we at TIME hope you find the objects of art you dream of when you open your Christmas packages-and wish you the best for the holiday season .
