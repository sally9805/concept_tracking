Where he came from nobody knew or at first cared . Older heroes of other generations had darkened the walls of the poolhalls long before Cody got there ; memorable eccentrics , great poolsharks , even killers , jazz musicians , traveling salesmen , anonymous frozen bums who came in on winter nights to sit an hour by the heat never to be seen again , among whom ( and not to be remembered by anyonebecause there was no one there to keep a love check on the majority(47)of the boys as they swarmed among themselves year by year with only casual but sometimes haunted recognition of faces , unless strictly local characters from around the corner ) was Cody Pomeray , Sr. who in his hobo life that was usually spent stumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat in the same old bench which was later to be occupied by his son in desperate meditations on life . Have you ever seen anyone like Cody Pomeray ?  --  say on a streetcorneron a winter night in Chicago , or better , Fargo , any mighty cold town , a young guy with a bony face that looks like it 's been pressed against iron bars to get that dogged rocky look of suffering , perseverance , finally when you look closest , happy prim self-belief , with Western sideburnsand big blue flirtatious eyes of an old maid and fluttering lashes ; the small and muscular kind of fellow wearing usually a leather jacket and if it 's a suit it 's with a vest so he can prop his thick busy thumbs in place and smile the smile of his grandfathers ; who walks as fast as he can go on the balls of his feet , talking excitedly and gesticulating ; poor pitiful kid actually just out of reform school with no money , no mother , and if you saw him dead on the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hurry , in silence . Oh life , who is that ? There are some young men you look at who seem completely safe , maybe just because of a Scandinavian ski sweater , angelic , saved ; on a Cody Pomeray it immediatelybecomes a dirty stolen sweater worn in wild sweats . Somethingabout his tigerish out-jutted raw facebone could be given a woedownmelancholy if only he wore a drooping mustache ( a famous bop drummer who looked just like Cody at this time wore such a mustache and probably for those reasons ) . It is a face that 's so suspicious , so energetically upward-looking like people in passport or police lineup photos , so rigidly itself , looking like it 's about to do anything unspeakablyenthusiastic , in fact so much the opposite of the rosy Coke-drinking boy in the Scandinavian ski sweater ad , that in front of a brick wall where it says Post No Bills and it 's too dirty for a rosy boy ad you can imagine Cody standing therein the raw gray flesh manacled between sheriffs and Assistant D.A . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the culprit and who is the law . He looked like that , and God bless him he looked like that Hollywood stunt man who is fist-fighting in place of the hero and has such a remote , furious , anonymous viciousness ( one of the loneliest things in the world to see and we 've all seen it a thousand times in a thousand B-movies ) that everybody begins to be suspicious because they know the hero would n't act like that in real unreality . If you 've been a boy and played on dumps you 've seen Cody , all crazy , excited and full of glee-mad powers , giggling with the pimply girls in back of fenders and weeds till some vocational school swallows his ragged busses and that strange American iron which later is used to mold the suffering man-(48)face is now employed to straighten and quell the long wavering spermy disorderliness of the boy . Nevertheless the face of a great hero  --  a face to remind you that the infant springs from the great Assyrian bush of a man , not from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Simon Bolivar , Robert E. Lee , young Whitman , young Melville , a statue in the park , rough and free . The appearance of Cody Pomeray on the poolroom scene in Denver at a very early age was the lonely appearance of a boy on a stage which had been trampled smooth in a number of crowded decades , Curtis Street and also downtown ; a scene that had been graced by the presence of champions , the Pensacola Kid , Willie Hoppe , Bat Masterson re-passing through town when he was a referee , Babe Ruth bending to a sidepocket shot on an October night in 1927 , Old Bull Balloon who always tore greens and paid up , great newspapermen traveling from New York to San Francisco , even Jelly Roll Morton was known to have played pool in the Denver parlors for a living ; and Theodore Dreiser for all we know upending an elbow in the cigar smoke , but whether it was restaurateur kings in private billiard rooms of clubs or roustabouts with brown arms just in from the fall Dakota harvest shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in any case the great serious American poolhall night and Cody arrived on the scene bearing his original and sepulchral mind with him to make the poolhall the headquarters of the vast excitement of the early Denver days of his life becoming after awhile , a permanent musing figure before the green velvet of table number one where the intricate and almost metaphysical click and play of billiard balls became the background for his thoughts ; till later the sight of a beautifully reverse-Englished cueball leaping back in the air , after a cannonading shot at another ball belted straight in , bam , when it takes three soft bounces and settles back on the green , became more than just the background for daylong daydreams , plans and schemes but the unutterable realization of the great interior joyful knowledge of the world that he was beginning to discover in his soul . And at night , late , when poolhalls turn white and garish and eight tables are going fullblast with all the boys and businessmen milling with cues , Cody knew , he knew everythinglike mad , sitting as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard onlooker 's bench and yet noticing the special excellence of any good shot within the aura of his eyeball and not only that , the peculiarities and pitiful typehood of every player whether some over-flamboyant kid with his eleventh or twelfth cigarette dangling from his mouth or some old potbellied rotation wizard who 's left his lonely wife in a varnished studio room above a Rooms sign in the dark of Pearl Street , he knew it all . The first to notice him was Tom Watson . Tom was a **25;14284;TOOLONG with the great moon blue eyes of a saint , an extremely sad character , one of the smartest well-known shots of the younger generationin the locality . Cody could n't have been more than fifteen years old when he wandered in from the street . It was only that many years before , in 1927 , that Cody was born , in Salt Lake City ; at a time when for some Godforsaken reason , some forgotten , pitiably American , restless reason his father and mother were driving in a jalopy from Iowa to L.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orange grove or find a rich uncle , Cody himself never found out , a reason long buried in the sad heap of the night , a reason that nevertheless in 1927 caused them to fix their eyes anxiously and with throat-choking hope over the sad swath of brokendown headlamps shining brown on the road . . . the road that sorrowed into the darkness and huge unbelievable American nightland like an arrow . Cody was born in a charity hospital . A few weeks later the jalopy clanked right on ; so that now there were three pairs of eyes watching the unspeakable road roll in on Pa 's radiator cap as it steadfastly penetrated the night like the poor shield of themselves , the little Pomeray family , lost , the gaunt crazy father with the floppy slouched hat that made him look like a brokendown Okie Shadow , the dreaming mother in a cotton dress purchased on a happier afternoon in some excited Saturday five-and-ten , the frightened infant . Poor mother of Cody Pomeray , what were your thoughts in 1927 ? Somehow or other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road ; somehow or other nothing worked out right the way they wanted ; without a doubt they had a thousand unspecified troubles and knotted their fists in despair somewhere outside a house and under a tree where something went wrong , grievously and eternally wrong , enough to kill people ; all the loneliness , remorse and chagrin in the world piled on their heads like indignities from heaven . Oh mother of Cody Pomeray , but was there secretly in you a lovely memory of a Sunday afternoon back home when you were famous and beloved among friends and family , and young ?  --  when maybe you saw your father standing among the men , laughing , and you crossed the celebrated human floor of the then-particular beloved stage to him . Was it from lack of life , lack of haunted pain and memories , lack of sons and trouble and humiliated rage that you died , or was it from excess of death ? She died in Denver before Cody was old enough to talk to her . Cody grew up with a childhood vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is no different than the light of today or the light when Xerxes ' fleets confused the waves , or Agamemnon wailed ) in some kind of livingroom with beads hanging from the door , apparently at a period in the life of old Pomeray when he was making good money at his barber trade and they had a good home . But after she died he became one of the most tottering bums of Larimer(50)Street , making futile attempts to work and periodically leaving Cody with his wife 's people to go to Texas to escape the Colorado winters , beginning a lifetime swirl of hoboing into which little Cody himself was sucked later on , when at intervals , childlike , he preferred leaving the security of his Ma 's relatives which included sharing a bedroom with his stepbrother , going to school , and altar-boying at a local Catholic church , 91 for going off to live with his father in flophouses . Nights long ago on the brawling sidewalks of Larimer Street when the Depression hobo was there by the thousands , sometimes in great sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsreels , men with sober downturned mouths huddled in old coats waiting in line for misery , Cody used to stand in front of alleys begging for nickels while his father , red-eyed , in baggy pants , hid in the back with some old bum crony called Rex who was no king but just an American who had never outgrown the boyish desire to lie down on the sidewalk which he did the year round from coast to coast ; the two of them hiding and sometimes having long excited conversations until the kid had enough nickels to makeup a bottle of wine , when it was time to hit the liquor store and go down under ramps and railroad embankmentsand light a small fire with cardboard boxes and naily boards and sit on overturned buckets or oily old treestumps , the boy on the outer edges of the fire , the men in its momentous and legendary glow , and drink the wine . " Wheeoo ! Hand me that damn bottle ' fore I knock somebody 's head in ! " And this of course was just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all the poor lonely woe of the likes of Pomeray having to count pennies on streetcorners with the wind blowing his dirty hair over his snarling , puffy , disgruntled face , the revulsion of bums burping and scratching lonely crotches at flophouse sinks , their agony waking up on strange floors ( if floors at all ) with their mad minds reeling in a million disorderly images of damnation and strangulation in a world too unbearably disgusting to stand and yet so full of useless sweet and nameless moments that made them cry that they could n't say no to it completely without committing some terrified sin , attacked repeatedly by every kind of horrible joy making them twitch and marvel and gasp as before visions of heart-wrenching hell penetrating up through life from unnumberable hullabalooing voices screaming in insanity below , with piteous memories , the sweet and nameless ones , that reached back to fleecy cradle days to make them sob , finally bound to sink to the floor of brokendown pisshouses to wrap around the bowl and maybe die  --  this misery with a bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pomeray 's brain and the tremendous joy of the really powerful drunk filled the night with shouts and wild bulging power-mad eyes . On Larimer Street Cody 's father was known as The(51)Barber , occasionally working near the Greeley Hotel in a really terrible barbershop that was notable for its great unswept floor of bums ' hair , and a shelf sagging under so many bottles of bay rum that you 'd think the shop was on an oceangoing vessel and the boys had it stocked for a six months ' siege . In this drunken tonsorial pissery called a barbershop because hair was cut off your head from the top of the ears down old Pomeray , with the same tender befuddlement with which he sometimes lifted garbage barrels to city disposal trucks during blizzards or passed wrenches in the most tragic , becluttered , greasedark auto body shop west of the Mississippi ( Arapahoe Garage by name where they even hired him ) , tiptoed around a barber chair with scissor and comb , razor and mug to make sure not to stumble , and cut the hairs off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat stiffly at attention for this big event for a whole hour . Cody , Sr. was a fine gentleman . " Well now say , Cody , how 've been things in the hotel this summer ; anybody I know kick the bucket or which , or seen Dan up at Chilean Jack 's ? " " Ca n't talk right now Jim till I get the side of Bob 's head done  --  hold on just a second whilst I raise up that shade . " And a great huge clock tocked these dim old hours away as young Cody sat in the stove corner ( in cold weather ) reading the comic pages , not only reading but examining for hours the face and paunch of Major Hoople , his fez , the poor funny easy chairs in his house , the sad sickening faces of his hecklers who always seemed to have just finished eating at the table , the whole pitiful interesting world in back of it including maybea faint cloud in the distance , or a bird dreamed in a single wavy line over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking up whole sections of the visible world for speech ; that and Out Our Way , the ragdoll rueful cowboys and factory workers who always seemed to be chewing wads of lumpy food and wrapping themselves miserably around fenceposts beneath the great sorrowful burdens of a joke ; yet most blazing of all the clouds , the clouds that in the cartoon sky had all the nostalgia of sweet and haunted distance that pictures give them and yet were the same lost clouds that always called Cody 's attention to his immortal destiny when suddenly seen from a window or through houses on a June afternoon , lamby clouds of babyhood and eternity , sometimes in back of tremendous redbrick smokestacks that were made to look like they were traveling and toppling on the first and last day of the world and its drowsy butterflies ; making him think , " Poor world that has to have clouds for afternoons and the meadows I lost " ; sometimes doing this or looking at the sad brown or green tint pictures of troubled lovers in sensual living rooms of True Confessions magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend useless hours looking at nudist magazines at the corner newsstand ; sometimes , though , only fixing his eyes on the mosaic of the tiles on the barbershop floor where he 'd long imagined each little square could be peeled back endlessly , tiny leaf by tiny leaf , revealing in little microcosmic encyclopedia the complete historyof every person that ever lived as far back as the beginning , the whole thing a blinding sight when he raised his eyes from one tile and saw all the others like the dazzling crazy huge infinity of the world swimming . In warm weather he sat on the sidewalk on a box between the barbershop and a movie that was so completely beat that it could only be called a C- or a D-movie ; the Capricio , with motes of dusty sunshine swimming down past the slats of the boxoffice in drowsical midafternoon , the lady of the tickets dreaming with nothing to do as from the dank maw of the movie , cool , dark , perfumed with seats , where bums slept and Mexican children stared , there roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American West represented by baggy-eyed riders who drank too much in Encienega Boulevard bars galloping in the moonlight photographed from the back of a truck in California dirt roads , with a pathetic human plot you sometimes think is worked in to make everybody overlook who the riders really are . What disappointment little Cody felt never having a dime , or eleven cents to see the show ; not even a penny sometimes to spend all the time he wanted selecting a chocolate candy from a lovely becluttered counter in a poor dim candy store run by an old Syrian woman in a shawl where also there were celluloid toys gathering dust as those same immortal clouds passed over the street outside ; the same disappointment he felt on those nights when he sat amidst the haha-ing harsh yellings of those bums under the bridge with the bottle , when he knew that the men who were rich tonight were his brothers but they were brothers who had forgotten him ; when he knew that all the excited actionsof life which included even the pitiful getting of the night 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when suddenly beyond the freightyards towards the mountain darkness inhabited by great stars , where nevertheless and amazingly in a last hung dusk a single flame of the sun now making long shadows in the Pacific lingered high on Berthoud'smighty wall as the world turned silently , he could hear the  --  Denver &; Rio Grande locomotive double-chugging at the base of a raw mountain gap to begin the train order climb to the dews , jackpines , arid windy heights of the mountain night , pulling the sad brown boxcars of the world to distant junctions where lonely men in mackinaws waited , to new towns of smoke and lunchcarts , for all he knew as he sat there with his ragged sneakers stuck in the oily yard and among the sooty irons of his fate , to the glittering San Francisco fogs and ships . Oh little Cody Pomeray if there had been some way to send a cry to you even when you(53)were too little to know what utterances and cries are for in this dark sad earth , with your terrors in a world so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramming down to crown your head with anger , pain , disgrace , worst of all the crapulous poverty in and out of every splintered door of days , if someone could have said to you then , * nd made you perceive , " Fear life but do n't die ; you 're alone , everybody 's alone . Oh Cody Pomeray , you ca n't win , you ca n't lose , all is ephemeral , all is hurt . " Old Bull Balloon ( speaking of loneliness and the diaphanous ghost of days ) a singularly lonely man , and most ephemeral , along about one of these years went broke and became so poor that he went in on a ridiculouspartnership with Pomeray . Old Bull Baloon who usually went around wearing a poker-wrinkled but respectable suit with a watch chain , straw hat , Racing Form , cigar and suppurated red nose ( and of course the pint flask ) and was now fallen so low , for you could never say that he could prosper while other men fell , that his usually suppositious half-clown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and the twisted mouth , his utter lovelessness in the world alone among foolish people who did n't see a soul in a man , hounded old reprobate clown and drunkard of eternity , was now deteriorated down to tragic realities and shabbiness in a bread line , all the rich history of his soul crunching underfoot among the forlorn pebbles . His and old Pomeray 's scheme was well nigh absurd ; little Cody was taken along . They got together a handful of greasy quarters , bought wire , screen , cloth and sewing needles and made hundreds of flyswatters ; then in Old Bull 's 1927 Graham-Paige they headed for Nebraska to sell door to door . Huge prairie clouds massed and marched above the indescribable anxiety of the earth 's surface where men lived as their car belittled itself in immensity , crawled eastward like a potato bug over roads that led to nothing . One bottle of whiskey , just one bottle of whiskey was all they needed ; whereas little Cody who sat in the rattly back seat counting the lonely pole-by-pole throb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you buy in a grocery store all fresh in a happy red wrapper that reminded him speechlessly of happy Saturday mornings with his mother long dead  --  bread like that and butter , that 's all . They sold their pathetic flyswatters at the backdoors of farms where farmers ' wives with lone Nebraska writ in the wrinkles around their dull bleak eyes accepted fate and paid a nickel . Out on the road outside Cheyenne Wells a great argumentdeveloped between Pomeray and Old Bull as to whether they were going to buy a little whiskey or a lot of wine , one being a wino , the other an alcoholic . Not having eaten for a long time , feverish , they leaped out of the car and started making brawling gestures at each other which were supposed to represent a fistfight between two men , so absurd that(54)little Cody gaped and did n't cry . And the next moment they were embracingeach other , old Pomeray tearfully , Old Bull raising his eyes with lonely sarcasm at the huge and indefatigable heavens above Colorado with the remark " Yass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because everybody was in a hole during the Depression , and felt it . They returned clonking up Larimer Street with about eighteen dollars which was promptly that night hurled downward flaming in the drain like the fallen angel  --  a vast drunk that lasted five days and was almost humorousas it described crazy circles around town from the car , which was parked on Larimer at 22nd , little Cody sleeping in it , to an old office over a garage in a leafy side street that Old Bull had once used as headquarters for a spot remover venture and where pinochle at a busted dusty rolltop desk consumed thirty-six hours of their fevered reprieve , to a farm outsidetown ( now abandoned by some family and left to Old Bull ) and where drinking was done in barns and ruined living rooms or out in cold alfalfa rows , finally teetering back downtown , Pomeray migrating back to the railyards to collapse beneath Rex in a pool of urine beneath drippingramps while Old Bull Balloon 's huge pukey tortured bulk was finally reposed on a plank in the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke up in the car on a cold clear October morning and did n't know what to do , Gaga , the beggar without legs who clattered tragically on his rollerboard on Wazee Street , took him in , fed him , made him a bed on the floor like a bed of straw and spent the night thundering around in bulge-eyed sweat trying to catch him in a foul hairy embrace that would have succeeded if he 'd had legs or Cody had n't lowered himself out the transom . Years of hopping around with his father like this and on freight trains all over the West and so many futilities everywhere that he 'd never remember them all , and then Cody had a dream that changed his life entirely . It was in reform school , after the theft of his first car and when he had n't seen his Pa for a year . He dreamed he lived in an immense cosmicflophouse dormitory with the old man and Rex and other bums , but that it was somehow located in the Denver High School auditorium ; that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , carrying a mattress under his arm ; all up and down the street with its October night lights glittering clear swarmed the bums , with his father off somewhere doing something busy , excited , feverish . In the dream Cody was thirty years older ; he wore a T-shirt in the brisk weather ; his beer belly bulged slightly over the belt . His arms were the muscular arms of an ex-boxer growing flabbier . His hair was combed slick but it was thinning back from bony frowns and Mephistophelean hairlines . His face was his own but it was strangely puffed , beaten , the nose in fact was almost broken , a tooth was missing . When he coughed it sounded harsh(55)and hoarse and maniacally excited like his father . He was going somewhere to sell the mattress for wine money : his exhilaration was due to the fact that he was going to succeed and get the money . And suddenly his father wearing his old black baseball hat came stumbling up the street with a convulsive erection in his baggy pants , howling hoarsely " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ? Huh , Cody , did you sell the mattress yet ? "  --  and ran clutching after him with imploration and fear , a dream that Cody woke from with a repugnance that only he could understand . It was dawn ; he lay on the hard reformatory bed and decided to start reading books in the library so he would never be a bum , no matter what he worked at to make a living , which was the decision of a great idealist . At fifteen this child had the regimen of his life worked out in a confused and still and all pathetically practical way . He rose at 7 A.M. from Old Bull Balloon 's rolltop desk ( his current bed ) ; if the office was filled with poker players he slept in the bathtub of the Greeley or other hotels . At 7:15 he rushed downtown , washed at barbershop sink , if it was not available he used the YMCA sink . Then he delivered his paper route . Around nine he went to the Smith residence , where he knew a near-idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after which she always fed him a big meal . If this friendship with idiot maid sometimes failed he ran to Big Cherry Lucy 's at the Texas Lunch ( ever since thirteen Cody was able to handle any woman and in fact had pushed his drunken father off Cherry Lucy Halloween night 1939 and taken over so much that they fist fought like rivals and Cody ran away with the five dollar stake ) . At ten he rushed to the library for the grand opening , read Schopenhauer and magazines ( sometimes when he was n't reading funnies as a child he 'd get areal book off the old Greeley Hotel shelf and read down over the first words of every line Chinese style in childly thought , which is early philosophizing ) . At eleven o'clock he asked to wash cars and sometimes asked to park cars at the Rocky Mountain Garage ( already he could drive better than any attendant in Denver and in fact had stolen several other cars to try his skill since his time in the " joint " and parked them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , noon hour he used a paper route friend 's bike to ride five miles out to friends ' families for big meals , then helped with chores till two . Back to library for afternoon reading , history , encyclopedias and the bloody sad amazing Lives of the Saints , and making use of the library toilet ; four o'clock rest and meditationand connections in poolhall till closing time unless semipro twilight ballgame or other spectacles of interest sprung around town ; eleven o'clock he stole nickels off newsstands for a Bowery beefstew and found the place to sleep. ( 56 ) IT WAS A SATURDAY AFTERNOON in Denver , October , 1942 , when Tom Watson first saw pure-souled Cody sitting on that bench with his lower lip jutted up habitually in unconscious power that Watson thought was a gesture of profile power , a pose for somebody , when actually Cody was only dreaming there ; wearing Levi dungarees , old shoes without socks , a khaki Army shirt and a big black turtleneck sweater covered with car grease , and carrying a brand new toy accordion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the road , perched among the usual great numberofSaturday onlookers half of whom were waiting for tables and talking about everything that had happened during the week , the kind of things that made Cody feel like a sheepish fool with no news of his own and marveled to see them all curling their mouths in the derisive telling of interesting tales , even while Watson said to himself " Must be some young new punk . " Cody sat there , stunned with personal excitement as whole groups of them shouted across the smoke to other fellows in a tremendous general anticipation of the rapidly approaching almost unbearably important Saturday night in just a few hours , right after supper when there would be long preparations before the mirror and then a sharped-up city-wide invasion of bars ( which already at this moment had begun to roar from old afternoon drinkers who 'd swallowed their bar egos long ago ) , thousands of young men of Denver hurrying from their homes with arrogant clack and tie-adjustments towards the brilliant center in an invasion haunted by sorrow because no guy whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocksman could ever find the center of Saturday night in America , though the undone collar and the dumb stance on empty streetcorners on Sunday dawn was easy to find and in fact fifteen-year-old Cody could have best told them about it ; the premonition of this oncoming night together with the dense excitement of everything around the tables in the shadowy hall nevertheless failing to hide certain hints of heartbreaking loss that filtered in with chinks of daylight from the street ( October in the poolhall ) and penetrated all their souls with the stricken memory not only of wild wind blowing coalsmoke and leaves across town , and football games somewhere , but of their wives and women right now , with feminine purposes , with that ravenous womany glee trotting around town buying boxes of soap , Jell-o , floorwax , Dutch Cleanser and all that kind and placing these on the bottom of their wagons , then working up to apples at the fruitstand , containers of milk , toilet paper , half crushable items like that , finally chops , steak , bacon pyramiding to eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new toys , new socks and housedresses and lightbulbs , eagering after every future need while their men-louts slammed around with balls and racks and sticks in the dimness of their own vice . And there in the middle(57)of it stood melancholy Tom Watson , the habitue , the one always ready to take anybody on for a game , hunchbacked , meek , dreaming at his uprightcue-stick as naturally as the sentry with his spear or the hull-bump of a destroyer that you see on the horizon with its spindly ghost of a foremast , a figure so familiar in the brownness of the room that after awhile you did n't see him any more like certain drinkers disappear the moment they put their foot on the brass rail ( Old Bull Balloon , Julien Love , others ) , just for the most part standing there chalking his cue in the gesture of poolhall nonchalance he and all the others always used for quick look-sees , reassured . When he saw Cody he raised his eyebrow  --  he was interested in this wild-looking kid , but like an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placidly , dumbly surprised . Tom Watson on this lonely earth was a crippled boy who lived in unostentatious pain with his grandmother in a two-story house under great sidestreet trees , sat on the screened porch with her till poolhall time , which was usually midafternoon ; en route made the rounds of downtown streets , mild , sincere , dropping a word in the shoeshine parlor , another into the chili joint where his boys worked , then a moment on the sidewalk with that watchful , spitting , proprietary air of all young men of American daytime sidewalks ( there 's more doubt of it at night ) ; and then into the poolroom like a man going to work , where you could best judge his soul , as Cody did , seeing him standing stooped at his cuestickwith that unfathomable patience of an old janitor awaiting a thousand more nights of the debris of rotation , snookers and pinochle in the same brown meeting hall , his huge round eyes once they were fixed on you persisting like a baby 's who 's terrorstricken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk . Then again you saw that he prowled like a fox in his atmospheres , a weirdy , a secret wise man , making his living at pool ; if you looked closer you saw that he never missed a difficult shot once he finally got down to it ; that when he did go down and propped his thin artistic hand with forefingertip and thumb joined in a lean , architectural rest for cue 's smooth passage , unfolding his sculptured fingers below for ornament and balance on the green , a gesture so sophisticated in America that boys see it in their dreams as soon as they 've seen it once , at these times he was even less noticeable at work than when standing loafing in bunchy balled-up gloom at the ricketypylon of his cue-pole . Raggedy Cody sitting there watching this Tom Watson was the enactment of the drama of an American boy for the first time perceiving the existence of an American poet , this Tom Watson so tragically interesting , so diseased and beautiful , potent because he could beat anybody yet be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd , sometimes flashing a languid sad smile in answer to the shouts of dishwashers and dryclean pressers but usually just endur-(58)ing eternity on the spot he occupied , his Pepsi-Cola unattended on the ballrack , his eyes dreaming upon sorrows that must have been as deep as an Assyrian King 's and notwithstanding that when Cody grew up learned they were nothing but the pure dumb trances of a sweet crippled poolshark . At the moment when this strange love for Tom Watson and the great American Image of beautiful sadness which he represented was leaping in Cody 's imagination , and Watson himself understood from the corner of his eye that this boy was n't only interested in learning pool from him but everything he knew and would use it for purposes of his own which were so much vaster than anything Watson had ever dreamed that he would have to plead for Cody 's guidance in the end , Cody immediatelyjumped up , ran over and made the first great conman propositionof his life . It had to be a fantastic proposition ; the moment Watson looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact embarrassed pain because what was he expected to do with a kid rushing up to him and saying " Do you want to learn philosophy from me ? " with a wag of the finger , sly eyes , neck popping with muscles like a jackinthebox straining at the void of the world for the first time with a vigorous evil spring , Cody , his position established , leaped in . " Now further than that yet , and of course omitting to discuss the fact because already almost understood , i.e. , you teach me how to beat pool " ( pointing at himself ) " and I teach you " ( socking Watson in the chest with his forefinger and really hurting him ) " I teach you further into psychology and metaphysics " ( Cody mispronounced it " metafsicks " only because at this time he just had n't carefully looked at it yet and when he did several weeks later it caused him tremendous private grief to remember this ) " and further beyond all that and in order to cement our relationship and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only if you agree , as I do  --  in fact to establish a blood brother loyalty of our souls , if you wish to use clitchay expressions at this time or any other , and again just as you agree , always as you agree " ( jabbing the iron finger again but this time careful not to touch , just holding it quivering powerfully within the tiniest fraction of an inch from Watson 's chest ) " I propose now and without any further shillyshallying , though " ( rubbing his hands busily , rocking back and forthwith one foot in front of the other , his head down but watching Watsonwith an underlook that was very arrogant , cocky , suddenly sarcasticallysuggestive , the rocking deliberate not only like a boxer getting ready arranging his skip rope or a pitcher on the mound rubbing up the ball with a half-sarcastic expression on the catcher 's preliminary sign but almost hypnotic in the way it attracted Watson who watched entranced and j ust barely seemed to be wonderingly rocking with him )  --  " though I can whip a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old tin and I know buddies for free greasejobs plus where to steal cans of oil and even one(59)tankful during the ballroom dance at eleven tonight on Broadway when I go a round the cars parked in my boy ' s lot with my siphon and mouth-suck up into cans on the average a half a gallon gas per car which is unnoticeablebut awful hard work , etcetera on , I still have to find the car , you see , huge troubles natcherly as I consider energy and every and all contingencybut listen carefully to me ( and I will , no fear , to compensate , find , or steal a car , any time you agree , or say , whatever ) if you want to go to the Notre Dame game this Saturday in South Bend , Indiana and REALLY want to see it and not just loafing the idea  --  stop a moment to understand ! " he commanded Watson who 'd started to speak . " All week I heard you and all the other fellows bettin , saying Well now I sure would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talking like people often do whose wish-plans never crystallize see because of lazy blocks that multiplyon the back road of old delays yet I 'm offering a real ji-nu-ine chance and I repeat if you really want to see it I 'll go get my Uncle Bull 's old Graham-Paige ( ! ! ! ) if necessary " ( this was such a tremendous concessionCody showed a stagger ) " see ? Which he wo n't miss not only because it does n't run hor hor , but right now he 's freezing his assets in Montany ha ha ha hee hee hee " ( staggering back with a high silly-gigling laugh for what he thought in those days was a tremendous joke and in fact bumpingagainst others , one of them a gloomy C.B. &Q.; brakeman who was just then bending down for an easy straight shot and missed completely on account of Cody in his foolish kid stupid excitement to be noticed , a sentiment that the brakeman , chewing his gum as fast as he could go while aiming now expressed by not removing his cue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jaws chewing slowly ) " and positively I can take you to the game and back in record time through chill winters and U. S. mails and all things and really blow the road wide open so long as you provide your ticket of course , after all , whoo ! " ( wiping himself in a parody of adroitness with a dirty handkerchief ) " see ? Whereas you watch the game but I 'll wait outside either in the car or in a diner listening on the radio or better try to see panoramic touchdowns from a roof or tree , or even better I 'll hustle around town while you 're enjoying and see if I can find some girls for us , money we can borrow with the promise we 're cousins say from Oopla , Indiana next door and come in every Saturday to attend the fair you see and tell them we usually have a lot of money but not this time on account Pa 's hard time with the hayin this fall and the pumpkins did n't sell etcetera and then we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or someplace where maybe they get money from their aunt or cousins , anybody . See ? All that and most of it simple except as I say omigosh a ticket , a ticket to the Notre Dame football game one thousand miles away , six million feet deep with telephones and luminaries I ca n't begin to even(60)imagine , pity poor me and the big tickets to world stadiums , so I leave it to you ... you ... and also type of car , also anybody you want to bring . I be your chauffeur , you teach me pool , snookers , anything else comes in your mind , be my big brother , I be your helper . So it be ! So it be ! What say ? " It was too completely mad for flabbergasted dumb old Tom Watson , one of the kindest fellows in the world , who in any case could never be expected to even have the energy to face a thousand miles of deliberately absurd travel in a clonking old heap , no , Watson 's first , real , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My land , " he said to himself , " he 's practically crazy from being hungry I bet ! " He took him home that afternoon to his grandmother 's house . They had a big snack from the icebox , Cody drinking two and a half quarts of milk in fear that he 'd never see that much for several more years , and making sure not to tear the bread when he folded it over the butter , clutching his chest , actually clutching his chest when he realized Watson'sgrandmother was only standing over them to refill their glasses from a fresh bottle of milk , not pleased or displeased but just a nice old woman with a rosy moon face , glasses , white hair , wearing cotton stockings over her piano legs that supported her so firmly and unmovablyin the halos of her bright linoleum and a housedress that in the course of tender chores around the house which was as comfortable as an old pillow , had taken on the kindly , almost dear shapelessness of her herself , the simplicity and sadness of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he bent to his supper , her grandson whom she served and honored , enough to make Cody feel like crying for his own mother whom he was positive now would have been something like Watson 's grandmother , just as calm , plain , humble , like old women who run rickety grocery stores in dumpy backyard neighborhoods of trees and woodfences . In Watson 's bedroom upstairs the boys spent a quiet hour facing each other at a folding cardtable set near the window where the lace curtains puffed in with the breeze and played over the flowery wallpaper and knickknacks of windowshelf , the mere sight of this graceful drowsy phenomenon making Cody marvel and enjoy life ( always high at fifteen ) to be in a real home that had lace curtains and little feminine lonely frills in it to beat harsh nature , as Watson , not realizing that Cody was thinking these kinds of thoughts , proceeded in a thorough explanation of the various first steps in cheating at cards . " First off you see Cody you mark ' em best with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , to designate face cards , acies and deucies . " " Yes ! " cried Cody . " Yes indeed ! " ( 61 ) From a closet next to a dark wood dresser with carved iron grips that swung on little hinges in rich significant clicks , and next to the right front bedpost of Watson 's fourpost manorial boxspring bed in which Cody imagined Watson slept like the little boys in fleecy nightgownsin mattress advertisements of the Saturday Evening Post , which he realized now he was confusing with a rubber tire ad that shows a little boy wandering out of bed with a candle on New Year 's Eve but expresses the same tender comfort of angels and vision of American children ( ah poor Cody who 'd seen this vision in those soaked magazines that have been dried by the sun and stand on tattered edges among weeds and cundrumsof backlots ) , from that closet that seemed too rich because it was next to these things and inside had the luxuriant darkness of suits all flashing dim from starry moth crystals ( and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson pulled out a fairly good brown tweed suit and , with a slight bow like a Viennese nobleman , like the Bela Lugosi vampire Count bowing to the young hero at the door of the rainy castle , he presented it to Cody to keep , Cody in turn offering his toy accordionas collateral anyway , with a smile and still bowing Watson saying he 'd keep it for him . It was Cody 's first suit : he bulged out of the new clean underwear ; bulged out of the starched white shirt that was handed to him with a laundry cardboard brace in the collar that made him wonder if he had to fiddle with it like irascible millionaire husbands tugging before last minute mirrors in B-movies , he bulged out of the necktiethat wound foursquare around the pillars of his neck , but out of the suit he exploded , the buttons were in danger of popping , the trouser creases were stretched flat out of sight on his thighs , the back seams of the coat showed connective spinal threads , the sleeves took the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Popeye 's . " Damn ! Do I look sharp ? " He looked alright but strange . So awed by these new clothes that he could hardly turn his head when Watson talked to him , but only nodded up and down , his long hair bushy and uncombable , his thoughts all pompous sweaty astonishment like the cartoon characters they draw with bewildered perspirations raining from their heads , just as ludicrous as that , and yet as that bright afternoon that had shed its radiance unaskedfor so long now showed itself to be turned into old red afternoon when they stepped forth from the house , and piteous remorse among men , birds , and trees that had transpired while they were dressing still haunted the air with that hung silence that makes people ask themselves sadly " Oh what happened to the afternoon ? " and later when the general autumn dying quietly like a brave soldier overwhelms them , " Oh what happened to the year ? " , Cody , very like an Episcopalian farmer boy going to church the Sunday morning before his wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him that characterizes all mortal persecuted breath beneath this hugeness , literally had to be led stupidly and stiffly down the street by Watson as they hurried back to the pool parlor to meet the entire gang . It was going to be a big night , suit and all . It did n't take long for Cody to quicken his steps with Watson 's and soon they had pinpointed downstreetand were swinging around the corner to a big trolley line thoroughfare , hurrying for the big-traffic , ever-more-exciting , **34;14311;TOOLONG night , both of them with the same bright fresh gleam in their eyes that you see on the shiny fender of a new automobile when it turns in from the darkness and outskirts of town and immediately reflectsSaturday night Main Street neons where before it just sat black in a dark garage or else in the driveway collecting dim dressing lights from the upstairs of the house , vanishing like a comedy team rightward in a vision of ankles twinkling in the dusk with regardant bending figures pointed downtown plunging through the same pocket of excitement which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fogs from their mouths as they yaketty-yakked along ( with lone envy Cody used to watch other guys cutting along like this , sometimes from Mission reading-room windows on nights when it was so cold he thought he could read what the buddies said before their intense voluminous talking-fogs whipped back to dissolve in wintry eternity ) ; Cody finally forgetting he was wearing a suit , forgetting the high entrapment of the collar and the woolly stifling around his armpits and the unfamiliar scuffling cuffs out of which he soon in fact resumed telling Watson further things and all things about himself , gesturing out of the shiny round starch his big grimy cracked hands that were not at all the hands of an absorbed banker in the street but more like a dirt farmer 's at a funeral and worse like horny toads in a basket of wash . " Now in Gaga 's barbershop in back and setting way up high behind the water heater I have a bag of clothes , harkening to clothes , but to go and pick it up involves terrible divisions with Gaga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just old pants and belts and polkadot shirts , but further I have an extry pair of fairly good workshoessettin way up high so nobody can notice on top of a locker in the Y and my plan , actually and no lie , was getting down to Colorado Springs or Raton or some such to freeze m'fingers off in construction camps or whichever "  --  and soon as Watson assured him he had plenty of clothes for him and not to worry . Excitement of hurrying downtown on foot for the big night reached a supreme peak when suddenly as they rushed armin-armand came to cross Broadway the light instantly changed for them and they did n't have to wait but just hustled right straight on across the street for the poolhall , that light that would n't allow lulls in the rhythm of their joy holding up whole avenues of traffic exactly for them to sweep(63)along , profound , bowed , bumping heads together ; Cody so singing in his soul now that he had to talk on several levels to express himself to Watson : " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here and why even go to Fort Collins where it 's so c-o-l-d ( whee ! zoom ! look at that new Cadillac ! ) and I did n't further finish about earlier speaking of Gaga and all the things I want you to know  --  " ; his arm around Watson , tight armpits or no tight armpits , he the only one who 'd ever put his arm around the hump of Watson 's sorrow ; similarly in the moment , seeing , just as they reached the other curb , in the exciting shadows of a five-andtenawning and to his deeper and simultaneously running amazement , a beautiful girl fixing on him from her casual one-leg-forward hand-onhipposition by the weighing machine waiting for the bus a cold arrogant look of sensuality done with misty eyes and something suggestive , impatient , almost too personal to understand , astonishing him in the realization that he was wearing a suit for the first time in his life and this was the first official sex-appeal look from a regular high-heeled downtown socialitehoney ( still finding room to yell " Watson watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reflecting : " So this is what these damn dames and big guys been doing , giving each other turble personal glances of angry snaky love that I did n't know about in my previous boy days beatin around the sidewalk with my eyes on the gutter looking for nickels and dimes wearin goldang cockin old pants . Damn ! Lessgo ! " In the poolhall the hour was roaring . It was so crowded that spectatorswere standing obscuring everything from the street and somebody had the backdoor open simultaneously with the alley door of the Welton Street parlor so that you could see a solid city block of poolhall from the north side of Glenarm to the south side of Welton interrupted only by a little tragic alley of shadows with a garbage can , like looking down a hall of mirrors over a sea of angrily personalized heads and islands of green velvet , all in smoke . To Cody it was a vision , the moment of his arrival that everybody was waiting for , yet even though he stood in the door at the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wearing not only his clothes but the same gorgeously sophisticated robe of their afternoon 's adventure which was already undergoing a rich change to evening and the lazy explorations that were to come , a decadent refinementthat all the dumb bastards in this dimness would have to struggle to understand to know anything hereafter even about pool , nobody made a move to notice or even gave much of a crap and Cody would have immediatelyfelt drowned again except suddenly for the saving memory of a hunch he used to have in boyhood which was whenever he turned his back on the people who were involved with him and even others who happened to be standing nearby , perfect strangers sometimes , they immediatelygathered with the speed of light at the nape of his neck to discusshim voicelessly , dancing , pointing , until , jerking his head around(64)for a quick look or just slowly to check , it turned out they 'd always twanged back in place with all-to-be-expected fiendish perfect hypocrisy and in exactly the same bland position as before . Remembering anyhow his father when in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place howling " Hallelujah I 'm a bum , bum again " Cody as he came in , very carefully digging everything through shrewd half closed eyes so he could size up and savor the scene for everything it had , jazzing on the balls of his feet in that thing Americans do instead of pinching themselves , now repeated the song to himself , " Hallelujah I 'm a bum , bum again , " in a secret , sly , interested whisper of his own he always used to refer back to sad factors of the past . While Watson was busy looking around , Cody directed his attention to a spot on the floor near table numberone where , after he had got tired looking at people on those long watchful nights , he used to spend stranger further hours on the onlookers ' bench absentmindedly studying the reality and vying with the existence of cigarette butts and spit by estimating exactly how it got there on the floor , wondering why for instance a particular calm spit gleamed like it did even though it had been rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the clock ) two and a half minutes earlier by a bluejowledconductor who had to spit and would n't have spat otherwise but came apparently to think of something completely different at the button wire counting the score and scratching his chin ( all as voices of the fellowsreverberated around the walls of the hall and moaned in his absent not-listening ear ) , so that as far as the spot of this conductor 's own spit was concerned it no longer existed for him , only for Cody ; Cody then estimating exactly how he himself got there , not only the world but the bench , not only the bench but the part of the bench he filled out , not only that but how he got there to be aware of the saliva and the part of the bench his ass filled out , and so on in the way the mind has ; at all of which now because it was n't his best idea of what to do in a poolhall , in Watson'scompany he made his ceremonial sneer and official revenge , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet he could n't quite see the exact spot he had studied , though he knew there were new cigarette butts and spit on that spot now , like little brothers and sisters following in the stead of others long ago studied and swept away , in any case doing all this so that the first full-fledged moment of his poolhall charactership would not be spoiled in fevers and forgetful excitement like running up to people to talk , but instead he would take advantage of his big chance to keep his attention disciplined on his good luck , and so do so in the roots of previous well-considered sorrow of October in the Poolhall . " What are you doing Cody ? " asked Watson when he noticed how pensivehe was . Oh ragged sailing heart !  --  it was far from time for Cody to be able to(65)even want to explain his craziest secrets . " Actually and no lie , Tom , I was thinking to myself what a wonderful guy this Tom Watson fellow is really truly indeed . " Slim Buckle , Earl Johnson and Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . They were grouped around a rear table in the usual ritual get-together game of rotation that they had every Saturday evening as a kind of preliminary tactical conference on the night 's action and for starting and a Coke . The program tonight featured two girls who were baby-sitting for the weekend in a house up near the Wyoming line . But this night without knowing it they were grouped around with that hotheaded dumbness the purpose of which is always to be ignorant of what 's about to happen , the only sure thing you can remember when you look back to see what people were doing during an important historical moment , sore , sullen , sighing from the drag of time , inattentive as always , impatient not only with life but always exactly the life unfolding in the immediate vicinity , the miserable here , the lousy now , as though all the blame was on that , and yet the poor souls actually sitting in that mysteriousgodlike stuff that later makes them say , " Listen , I was there the night Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1942 , Autumn , they had the Army-Columbia game that day I bet on it and heard it on the radio too , we were all playing pool me and Slim Buckle who just got haircuts and Earl Johnson and Jackoff and I du n no who the hell else , Christ we all drove to Wyoming that night , sure , it was a great mad night ! " Cody was introduced around . " Here comes Tom Watson ; who 's that kid with him ? What 's that , your cousin ? What happened to you and Jackoff Friday night ? Cody is it ? Hiya boy . " And Cody with that strange little feeling of pleasedness that shivers deep in your chest and makes you want to hug yourself and explain everything to the man next to you , found himself standing at one table among all the others roaring with what he could now almost call his own gang as exciting shadows outdoorsfell and they played eightball  --  Cody and Watson versus Buckle and Johnson with goodnatured Evans kibitizing . And everything they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the Sandwich Shop I know her , if she had as many rods stickin out of her as she had in she 'd look like a porcupine , yah , do n't laugh I stole it from Tony "  --  and everything they did  --  one reaching up to slap over the score and another reaching down to carefully place his Coke and another lookinghorizontally along his cue to see if it was too curved  --  was all part of one great three-dimensional moil that was all around him now instead of just flat in front of his face like a canvas prop , he was up on the stage with the show now . So he stood there with his weatherbeaten face growingmore excited and redder by the hour , his big raw hands gripped(66)around a cue , looking bashfully at his new friends and planning deep in his mind from everything they said and did the positively best , in fact only way to begin completely , helplessly impressing everyone and winningover their favor so conclusively and including their souls that eventually of course they would all turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually did run the gang , who was now just being merely coy quiet knowing instinctively the best way to start despite the fact that he never knew a gang before and the only thing he 'd done was grab some poor kid by the arm in the junkyard or a newsboy in the street or some of the bicyclists on the paper route and make long strange speeches to them like the great speech he made to Watson that afternoon but they were too young to understand and frightened . So he stood stiffly at attentionat the table side , sweaty in his suit , or made stupid hilarious shots laying out his big hand flat and flaccid for a cue-rest as if a baby was trying to shoot pool , and the boys laughed but only because Cody was so seriously absent-minded in his hilarious dumbness ( trying to learn , they thought ) and not because he was inconsequential . Right away the biggest fellow in the gang took a liking to Cody , six-foot-four Slim Buckle all shiny handsome in his Saturday night suit , who was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half comical because it seemed to come from the loneliness of his great height which prevented him from being on a level with other faces so that he dreamed up there his own special juvenile dreams all the less realistic because they were so far from his feet where the ground was , the others had to stare dumbly at his vest most of the time , a fate that he accepted with immense and tender satisfaction . This goodnatured long tall drink of water took a liking to Cody that soon became hero worship and later led to their rambling around the country , buddies  --  a thing that Earl Johnson noticed and resented from the start . He was almost instantly jealous and immediately proclaimed next day in Watson 's ear ( when it was too late ) Cody was n't everything he seemed to be . So when the gang gave up the precious table and let their empty Cokes plop in a floorbox with a " So long fellers " and left the hall to jump in the car , a ' 37 Ford belonging to Evans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sun just then going down in vast unobserved event above the madding souls of people , and Cody above the objections of everyone else insisted on drivingto show his skill , but then really fantastically wheeled the car right clear out of town with beautiful spot-shot neatness and speed , the guys who were prepared to criticize his driving and give pointers or stage false hysterical scenes forgot they were in a car and fell to gabbing happily about everything  --  Suddenly out on East Colfax Boulevard bound for Fort Collins Cody saw a football game going on among kids in a field , stopped the car , said " Watch " ran out leaping madly among kids(67) ( with noble seriousness there wearing those tragic lumps like the muscles of improvised strongmen in comedies ) , got the ball , told one blondhaired boy with helmet tucked underarm to run like hell , clear to the goalpost , which the kid did but Cody said " Further , further , " and the kid halfway doubting to get the ball that far edged on back and now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass that dropped beyond the kid 's most radical estimate , the pass being so high and powerful the boy completely lost it in eyrieal spaces of heaven and dusk and circled foolishly but screaming with glee  --  when this happened everyone was amazed except Johnson , who rushed out of the car in his sharp blue suit , leaped around frantically in a mixup of kids , got the ball ( at one point fell flat because of his new shinybottomshoes that had only a half hour 's poolroom dust on ' em ) and commandedthe same uncomplaining noble boy to run across the field and enragedly unfurled a long pass but Cody appeared out of nowhere in the mad lowering dusk and intercepted it with sudden frantic action of a wildfaced maniac jumping into a roomful of old ladies ; spun , heaving a prodigious sky pass back over Johnson 's head that Johnson sneered at as he raced back , he 'd never been outdone by anybody ( " Hey whee ! " they yelled in the car ) ; such a tremendous pass it was bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on East Colfax , yet Johnson ran out there dodging traffic as mad red clouds fired the horizon of the mountains , to the west , and somewhere across the field littler tiny children were burningmeaningless fires and screaming and playing football with socks , some just meaninglessly tackling one another all over in a great riot of October joy . Circling in the road , almost being murdered by a car driven eighty miles per by Denver 's hotshot ( Biff Buferd , who tooted ) , Johnson made a sensational fingertip sprawling-on-knees catch instantly and breathtakingly overshadowed by the fact that dramatic fantastic Cody had actually gone chasing his own pass and was now in the road yurking with outstretched hands from the agony that he was barely going to miss , himself sprawling as terrorstricken motorists swerved and screeched on all sides . This insane scene was being beheld not only by Biff Buferd laughing like hell as it receded eighty miles an hour out of his rearview window , but across the wild field with its spastic fires and purple skies ( actually an empty lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , the goalposts just sticks the kids " put up with believing crudeness of primitive Christians " ) was propped all by itself there an old haunted house , dry gardens of Autumn planted round it by nineteenth-century lady ghouls long dead , from the weatherbeatengreen latticed steps of which now descended Mr. behatted beheadedJustin G. Mannerly the mad schoolteacher with the little Hitler mustache , within months fated to be teaching Cody how to wash his ears , ( 68 ) how to be impressive with highschool principals  --  Mannerly now stopped , utterly amazed , halfway down , the sight of Cody and Earl Johnson furying in the road ( almost getting killed too ) , saying out loud " My goodness gracious what is this ? " ; same who in fact that afternoon , at the exact moment Cody was approaching Watson , sat in a grave of his own in his overcoat in an empty unheated Saturday classroom of West Denver High not a mile across town , his brow in his hand as blackboard dust swam across October fires in the corner where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chalk from yesterday 's class ( in American Lit . ) When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom 'd , sat there in a pretense of thinking for the benefit of any teachers and even kids passing in the hall with some of whom just before he 'd in fact been joking ( threw a feeble lopsided pass across the afternoon lawn as he hustled from Studebaker to business ) , sat now moveless in a pretense of remembering , with severe precision , the exact date of something that was bottleneckinghis entire day , left wrist raised for a quick look at how much time was left , frown of accompaniment already formed , drawer pulled with letterheaded memo paper ready to fly the instant he smacked the desk deciding , but actually choking over loss , choking over loss , thinking of the love , the love , the love he missed when his face was thin and fresh , hopes were pure . 0 growing old ! 0 haggard ugly ghoul is life 's decay ! Started life a sweet child believing everything beneath his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that mask of disgusted flesh called a face but not the face that love had hoped for and to that soul of a gruesome grieving ghost that now goes shuddering through nightmare life cluttering up the earth as it dies . Ah but well , Earl Johnson wanted to throw a pass to Cody and Cody challenged him and said " Run with the ball and let 's see if I tackle you before you reach that Studebaker where the man 's standing " ; and Johnson laughed because he had been ( absolutely ) the outstanding runner everywhere ( schools , camps , picnics ) , at fifteen could do the hundred in 10:9 , track star speed ; so took off not quite realizing what he 'd done here giving Cody these **26;14347;TOOLONG and looking back at him with taunts " Well come on , come on , what 's the matter ? " And so that Cody furiously , as if running for his life , not only caught up with him but even when Johnson increased his speed in wholehearted realizing race caught up with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented raw athletic power he could run the hundred in almost ten flat ( actually and no lie ) , and a sad , remote tackle took place in the field , for a moment everybody saw Cody flyingtackling horizontally in the dark air with his neck bulled on to prove , his head down almost the way a dead man bows his head self-satisfied and life-accomplished but also as if he was chuckling up his coat sleeve at Johnson about-to-be-smeared , both arms outstretched , ( 69 ) in a tackling clamp that as he hung suspended in that instantaneous fix of the eye were outstretched with a particular kind of unspeakable viciousness that 's always so surprising when you see it leaping out of the decent suits of men in sudden sidewalk fights , the cosmopolitan horror of it , like movie magnates fighting , this savagery explosively leaping now out of Cody 's new suit with the same rage of shoulderpads and puffy arms , yet arms that also were outstretched with an unspeakablemute prophesied and profound humility like that of a head-down Christ shot out of acannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnsonwas tackled ; Justin G. Mannerly called out " Why did n't you try that in the road I have a shovel in the car " nobody noticing , even as he drove off ; and Cody , like Johnson with his knees all bruised and pants torn , had established his first great position of leadership in Tom Watson 's famous gang . Long ago in the red sun  --  that wow-mad Cody , whose story this is , lookout . A WHOLE BUNCH OF SAD and curious people and half morose kicked around the weeds in the ordinary city debris of a field off East Colfax Avenue , Denver , October 1942 , with semi-disgruntled expressionsthat said " There 's something here anyway . " Crap in weeds was an old map , Cashmere Soap paper , bottom glass of a broken bottle , old usedoutflashlight battery , leaf , torn small pieces of newspaper ( someone had saved a clipping and then torn it ) , nameless cardboards , nameless mats of hay , light bulb cardboards , old Spearmint Gum wrapper , ice cream box cover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rousseau-like but October rusted leaves  --  old cellophane  --  old bus transfer ticket , the strange corrugated cardboard from egg crates , a rock , pieces of brown beerbottle glass , old Phillip Morris flattened pack  --  the roots of weeds were purplish borscht color and left the matted filthy earth like tormented dog cocks leave the sac  --  sticks  --  coffee container  --  and an empty pint bottle of Five Star brand California Sherry drunk by an old wino of the road when things were less grim . What actually had happened a miscarriage was discovered by some children in the field and reported to a cruising cop who 'd now sent his partner back to call up a morgue wagon . There was something tremendouslyembarrassing about it because you wanted to see it and yet if you did you had to be conspicuous , had in fact to pick out the spot where it was supposed to be and even if you found that had to crane over others and giveaway the fact which is tremendously painful that you with your personal embarrassed also disgruntled face want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come snooping around to see it  --  probably knowing all the time what it was  --  Cody was embarrassed therefore till(70)the other fellows ( Tom Watson , Slim Buckle , Earl Johnson ) joined him from the car and then it was easy to talk  --  But now : what a forlorn thing it is and frightening that the nameless soul ( the thing created by the terribleness of a womb which when it does halfway work or even complete work takes the melted marble of man 's sperm which is a kind of acceptable substance , say in a bottle , and transforms it by means of the work of some heinous secret egg into a large bulky piece of decayable meat  --  ) that this nameless little would-have-been lay , spilling out of that grocer 's bag , grocer 's wrapping , under a tree that by dry Autumn had been turned almost the same shade of red , turned thus instead of by wet and secret wombs  --  Girls are frightening when you see them under these circumstances because there seems to be a kind of insistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out that personal thing about you which is probably the thing that you expect and burn and kill to find in them when you think of penetrating their thighs  --  that secret wetness of the woman is as unknown to you as your eyes are to her when they 're confronted by a miscarried whatnot in a field under dark and mortal skies  --  Thus Cody ponders . Whatever he says ( in the tragic dusk of this field , bareheaded ) , he says nothing nowThe roads that Cody Pomeray knew in the West and that I rode with him later were all those tremendously frightening two-lane bumpy roads with those ditches on both sides , that poor fence , that rangefence next , maybe a sad cut of earth , a hair head of grass on a lump of sand , then endlessrange leading to mountains that belong to other states sometimes  --  but that road always seems destined to bounce you in the ditch because it humps over each way and the feeling is of the car rolling on a side angle , inclined to a ditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as a consequence of this Western roads are lonelier to ride than any . Long hauls straight ahead and on a Saturday night you can see maybe five cars in the next five miles coming your way each headlight smaller and creating that illusion of water on the road when they 're so far the lights are absorbed probably by the night mist entire or whatever it really is  --  the mirage of night driving across great flat spaces  --  Cody like everybody else to drive this has that elbow over the window and he particularly with his thick muscular noble efficient ( like necks of great busdrivers ) neck looks calm and relaxed and perfect at the wheel as you look over his shoulder at that road which at night only shows part of itself , the most conspicuous being the five-mile headlights coming your way  --  coming into Denver for Saturdaynight  --  and the swath , the side-wash swath of the car lights catching the side ditches and a part of the range that jacks over , inlaps the fence like a sea past a breakwater towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead earth flashing by in the night in swift blurrily fanning succession and just beyond you know there is , or(71)are , ends of the earth swinging out across the plain , thunderset , the desert , over gopher holes , over brush , sticks , rocks , tiniest pebbles reflectinglargest stars ( which are in reality galaxies ) till the inevitable mesas that terminate Western horizons give some kind of indication that the world has contours and the flatness 's got to stop  --  this is flashing by , the stars are distant , if you put out the lights of the car you would see what you sense  --  Cody drove this that night eighty miles and drove it many other times too , north , south , east , west , and was perfectly still at the wheel for an entire hour and averaging an almost pure 80 m.p.h. in the trafficless wilds except for a town while the fellows gabbled and drank beer and sent cans banging after in the black abyss . Now girls . The house was located on the Union Pacific railroad track under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking buildings including one spare ( the Anglo North and its fool Norwegians have captured Moby Dick ! captured him a hundred years after ! ) vertical board church and a huge heavengoing creamy white silo with the name of the junction on it , a desolate place not even fit for a brakeman 's piss when the train 's stopped and watering , re-coaling , tanks , coal chutes . The house was somewhat sooty from railroad and therefore deliberately painted bright red window frames  --  brown sandpaper shingles over walls and on roof , those on roof pale green  --  weatherbeaten antique gray brick chimney protruding from peaked roof  --  wooden porch made into an extension out front , gray wood , full of bicycles , chairs , storm doors with lift hooks not knobs  --  and behind with adjunct wings getting smaller and beater in a graduating series , places to put overshoes , rubbers , umbrellas , addition-sheds , also gray wood but last little outhouseone has cheap English lamp hanging  --  In yard an old decrepit dresser facing house , shoved up against it with bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on house  --  junk in yard , including an old water-heater tank in high grass , pieces of sodden dog biscuit  --  and one old sunken ancient car collapsed on timbers as if on display , decapitated , emptied of all except flaps of leather , twang of seat springs , the inner hay of seats , old red rust dials , a steering wheel cracked so you can cut yourself on it , blind headlamps , a back trunkwhere birds have nested and snow and spring combined to raise a small green crop  --  old potatoes dumped from a sack rotting next to the right front wheel hub  --  the kids ' playplace  --  the dog 's pissery  --  the trough of moony cows in the summerrain . It was a Saturday night and if a train happened to crash by you would have to hold up everything you 're doing to freeze and wait . The two girls were not exactly the usual American girl team of the pretty one and the ugly old one because in this case the older one was extremely attractive herself only you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if **25;14375;TOOLONG was what you wanted tonight , real gnashing passion in the black , this older one  --  who looked away resolutely from everybody as if she was a schoolteacher who had orders to do so but with exactly that kind of sternly imposed self-discipline that was so pathetic and so tight you knew it was bound to explode and when it did it would be good for a man to be there to catch the contents of the act  --  Now Cody although he was only fifteen at the time noticed this about her the first thing because it was his habit to make his judgments as immediately as possible so as not to waste preliminaries on ordinary hello how are you I 'm Joe he 's Bill hee hee ignorance  --  the moment he stepped off the dark curb of the car , stood in the muddy yard ( it had rained in that part of Wyoming ) and saw the two girls standing in the face of the onslaught they knew would come from such a carload hemade his decision  --  simply , who 's best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute little sexy fleshpot of honey , gold and shiny hairs that you see in illustrations of Coca-Cola girls at fountains with equally pretty rosy boys and so much so , so startlingly what the guys wanted that immediately they were terrified to see it staring them in the face , the bird in the hand  --  with her pudgy arms that gave promise to the genuineness of two beautiful tits protruding from a deliciously soft cashmere sweater and her arched eyebrows and plump little foolish assy mouth . But I 'll start again . THEY GOT TO THE HOUSE where the girls were at nine o'clock sharp . It was located practically under a watertank of the U.P . railroad that passed right by and left that dark dirt which is like the concoction of an artist 's palette after a short rain , the black color artists use to depict night , gloom , maybe evil  --  and it had just rained when the boys pulled up and Cody cut off the motor in a kind of a driveway covered with this dark railroad snotground . A fitful moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light ( poolhall chinks of light , miscarriage field purples and iron file skies ) and now nobody could see anything except the shape of the house , a few brown lights in it , and the hanging pendant globe of a streetlamp not across the street but across a whole plaza of dirt which might have represented a crossroad , a soccer field , a square , because at the other end of it just barely seeable was an old wood church with verticalboards and gingerbread eaves , behind it even more vaguely in the lunar underground a crazy huge uplilting wheat silo painted wild aluminumand glowing like a June worm in the darkness of the plains that seemed to begin behind it but actually surrounded everything I 've been talking about  --  house , clearing , watertank , tracks , lamp , and a few furtherindications of a townlet beyond the road 's lamp  --  in one hollow misty carrousel of wild black space horses so close to one another that the only time you could see between them was when a faroff light indi-(73)cated it , a railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other county or the topmost glimmer of an antenna in a Cheyenne or whatever radio station . Johnson who 'd picked up one of the girls in Cheyenne a few weeks before and scored tried the storm door first while all the others stood around carrying the beers , the whiskey , the whatnot like altarbearers but with considerably more guilt and with a stirring in their gut that you feel in a whorehouse when you 're told to wait for the girl and suddenly you hear high-heel steps coming down the hall and envision the legs , the garters , the thighs , the panties , the breasts , the throat , the face , the hair of the woman coming  --  This was exactly the way they felt when Johnson unhooked the storm door with that delicacy of thumb and forefinger you need for such gadgets and as though he was unfastening a brassiere from the bulge-back of the house . Wild children opened the door ; there was a lot of stumbling over things on the porch floor but Cody never dreamed that one of the crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open up while they brush up the last wave was Joanna Dawson his future wife . In America it 's always two girls and one is always older and uglier than the other , except in this case it was more accurate to say that one was younger and prettier than the other because the older girl  --  Vivian , a sort of taut redhead with fairly short hair , in dungarees , the chaperone of the two and anybody looking at the younger girl could tell she needed one  --  Vivian was really pretty and to Cody who was only fifteen offered the most promise of passionate kicks as he came in and sized up everything in one second ( back ) " you had to look twice " or rather , here , again , he saw that she was supposed to watch out for everything and because of that and maybe had to that all her life was accustomed to acting stern like a teacher among irresponsible elements that element year by year now becoming lif a in general so that he instinctively realized she was a plum to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became an old Lesbic maid . Besides the dungarees Vivian was wearing moccasins and a blue man 's workshirt washed and re-washed and now faded and made to look feminine only by the crucifix that dangled over a freckle in the little throat-hole at the base of her frightened neck : an outfit that showed she did a lot of chores around the house and yard all day and rode horseback somewhere but also on this night seemed to be a concession on her part to the wild necking party her youngercousin had arranged via Johnson . Marie , the younger , was a vivaciousblond who habitually wore broad shiny leather belts , usually red , that emphasized the place where the finest part of her waist gave way to the swing of two white hips that must have looked like columns from there down to the toes if you could have looked under her skirt while the belt was on . Better than that , best of all , and for a reason that none of the(74)guys knew or even tried to form in their minds , Marie wore glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rosy natural lips with but just a tiny down of sideburn wisping down the cheekbone a price they could afford , without them she would have scared them off into the formal camps of complete ego-approach the kind American boys use for their Lana Turners in the rosy ballroom of the land , use for their idea of what it 's like to make Lana Turner and Ava Gardner and such . The same kind of approach they use on the boss when they go out to find their first whitecollar job . Marie was a wild little thing who read books and Dostoevsky and enough of D. H. Lawrence to make her ten times more aggressive than any shambling shy boy she could meet in this forlorndistrict of the world whether they came driving from Denver or lived a couple of telephone poles away . These two girls were cousins ; Vivian was the daughter of the thin countrified woman in glasses whose picture was on top of the player piano ; Marie was staying for the month , visiting from Killdeer , N. D. One of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose father , a cop in Santa Fe , was waiting for her annual visit from the general matriarchal Colorado . Big Slim Buckle sat on the couch among the others , Watson on one side , Johnson on the other , with a great beautiful sincerity that made Marie change her interior plans for the night , because it had been the prettiness of Johnson that attracted her and decided her to arrange this party no matter what happened , a prettiness that Buckle had in greater and tenderer proportions  --  These imaginings lead me backwards to my one and original poipose . DIRTY OLD VOYEURS . On Times Square all these dirty old men we all hate some of whom try to make boys as well as girls and are the ugliest old lechers , make you think of the Arabian proverb " A young woman flees an old man "  --  they wear hats , why all the time wear hats !  --  hang around subway entrances , little bookstores , library parks , chess arcades  --  prowl up and down  --  some so innocuous you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you ( say as you lean against building ) trying to look casual but somehowwith their dirty old hardpants pointed straight at you like a hex , a hoodoo pointed at the man goin down Dauphine Street to die  --  Nevertheless Cody and I have the same soul and we know what they do , we stood with them at dirty-picture windows from coast to coast  --  So here goes , all this was just defensive preamble , and I will add ( at least my own ) food kicks : ( anchovies with capers in olive oil is so rich it stuffs the throat , so salty it chokes you , so strong it seems to permeate and flavor the tin of the can itself until the tin tastes saltier than any salt , a metallic salt , the salt of Armageddon )  --  ( this is a food example )  --  ( 75 ) Cody and I are continually interested in the pictures of women 's legs  --  little black and white books nudged among many in a Times Square or Curtis Street bookstore window draw us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than color , in black and white the thigh is all the whiter , the background all the darker and evilCody used to say " Have this picture , I 've used it . " I have here a pix of Ruth Maytime ( the famous Hollywood actress ) and Ella Wynn and I love it  --  what tremendous lovely tits Ruth has , one shoulder strap of her suit is down , the other is flimsy , they reach very low because her breasts are low , heavy and way out thus stretching strap even further ( ah me strap ! )  --  her left breast occupies me for five nameless unconscious minuteson the sidewalk of Times Square and not her breast , just a pix of it , it is so vast , heavy , three-fifths concealed which is better than any other percentage , the nipple is in no danger of showing , what 's in danger is the point at which the soft yearning bulge might plop up , almost out  --  Ella 's is conventionally concealed , you can see the rich delicious soft living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy contours we all know  --  but Ruth 's is as if Ella was a stripteaser who started the act and Ruth went next step  --  pulled cloth down but only one end so that instead of one-fourth upper left of a breast showing ( with valley ) now we see three-fifths full upper breast with valley expanding  --  Ah those gorgeousbreasts  --  I stand here among the religious dirty old men of the world , chewing gum , like them , with a horrible beating heart  --  I can hardly think or control myself  --  I even know this is infinitely more deliciousthan touching Ruth 's breast itself ( though I 'd do anything for the chance )  --  But more , more about the breast itself  --  all my life I 've dreamed on breasts ( and of course thighs , but now we 're talking of breasts , hold your Venus , we 're talking about Mars , and your water , we 're talking about milk )  --  the dirty magazines of boyhood become the religious publications of manhood  --  to stop joking  --  one pull on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the thing that is holding me here and all these lechers , some of them ninety , holding us captive and especiallybecause we know it 'll never happen , it 's only a picture , but IF IT DID !  --  If so , a magnificent bouncing jelly-like white-as-snow warm strange Ruth-personal breast with a nameless but revealing nipple which would tell us everything we need to know ( the exact nipple will tell us more than Ruth 's entire life story , " Around the beauty parlors of Brooklyn during World War II a strange energetic young lady began to be noticeable to the characters who frequented the places afternoon and night and even to the casual visitors ... "  --  the first glimpse of it and we 've finally seen her soul , its perfection and its imperfection , its confession , its secret girlish shame , which is best of all what we want ) and everything we 've all our lives wondered about Ruth speaking of Ruth as(76)a woman who 's come across our attention only through her fame , pixes , husbands , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask her to have three-fifths of her living breast that I want to nudge between my lips photographed , she offered it herself and I 'm sure God will reward her for doing it  --  Ah that breast ! it is such a casual breast , it just went swimming with her , her hair 's wet , she 's cutting a cake on Orrin Wynn 's yacht , Edgar Bones the idiot is husbanding cutely at her side  --  her mouth is done up into what is supposed to be a smile but is really a great bit of desire and shuddering sensual bitterness ( she 's really cutting the cake ) and her teeth are like my teeth when I bring a little kitty 's nose next to mine  --  This pix is black and white , this breast is gray  --  there is more reality in gray for me ( and for Cody too ) because I was brought up in the balconies of B-movie theaters . Ah the holy contours all we men know  --  Now , not to leavethat , but let 's turn to knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a towel . Now all we lechers turn our vast , rumbling attentions in a body but with no military music and no salute and no flag except the Cross and Bones to the knees of Ella Wynn  --  they 're crossed , which would be unfortunate except by so being a little lovely dimple was formed on the back of the uppermost knee  --  I mean under the leg ( sweet smooth underleg like the belly of a warmblooded fish but much better ) . This dimple , which is just a crease between some back knee flesh and the inner bottom thigh smoothness is especially notable because it emphasizesas nothing else could the main feature which is the lowermost knee , the knee that 's crossed on  --  the great thing about that knee is the glossiness , indicative of the texture of that gal 's flesh and of the further textures inward from the glossiness ( my heart beats again ! ) to the thigh areas , deeper , more dazzling , dizzier , like climbing a mountain , till the gardens of her soul are within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along and among the mountains to see what expression it wears alongside the long beautiful hair in a big ribbon  --  we lechers by now really raping the poor girl whereas tough Ruthy did n't give us half that chance and subdued us and we jumped on her friend in cowardly revenge . We glance at Orrin Wynn as though we 'd known him forever and recognize him with a smile , that is , recognize that his eye is on the sparrow , i.e. , Ruth 's tit , not on Edgar as you might think if you do n't look close and Ella unsuspecting of this is smiling at the cake knife although that in itself is strange and perhaps infinitely more sadistic than Ruth and her gritting teeth  --  but Ella generally is a sweet little thing and althoughwe 've all just raped her , at least threatened to do so , we do n't want to harm her . We also wonder if there have been orgies and switchoversin this foursome and earnestly hope so as we might hope , as an example , for World Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner(77)newsstands make us hold up sidewalk traffic day and night . My next stop must be France ( postcards on the boulevard ? )  --  but further and later . SO IT WAS AS THOUGH CODY POMERAY 'S early life was haunted by the sooty girders and worn old black planks of railroad bridges behind warehouses , by cinder yards where great concentrations of cardboard crates that were a nuisance to foremen of factories became the sly opportunityof bums  --  the backplaces of what we call downtown , the namelesstunnels , alleys , sidings , platforms , ramps , ash heaps , miniature dumps , unofficial parking lots fit for murders , the filthy covered-withragsplazas thatyou seeatthe foot of great redbrick chimneys  --  the same chimney that had bemused Cody on many a dreaming afternoon when he looked at it toppling forward as clouds upswept the air in readiness for the big disaster  --  it was as though these things had been the  --  ( and of course many more , why list any further , and besides we shall come back on other levels and more exhaustively )  --  these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its furniture , just as the little rich boy in a blue playsuit in some swank suburb outside St. Louis stands , in November , beneath the bleak black branches , staring at a universe which is necessarily and unalterably furnished with things like half-timbered English style housefronts , circular wooded drives for avenue blocks , forests of birch , the wire fencing in back of Tudor garages , boxer dogs , bicycles , sleek autos reposant at dusk before the warm lights that shine behind the drapes of a Spanish style house worth twenty-eight thousand dollars bought by an insurance broker who cuts along the narrow redbrickdowntown streets of St. Louis near the markets by day , where you can see the river between box factories , earning his living among the trappings of the poor and of bums of all kinds but is incapable of stretching his home bones anywhere twenty miles away , inland from the river and the unclean city in private parks , quiet neighborhoods  --  Cody 's life , with the coming of the suit and consequently the beginning of some kind of different adult existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winter topcoat from Watson or one of the others in the gang and that nameless gesture that men have , became his , when they reach for something in their pants pockets and flapshroud the coat away , elbows bent , head to one side , like a theater manager coming out at midnight in a hurry checking to see if the keys are all there . With the coming of the suit and this adult gesture , Cody 's life in Denver entered a second phase and this one had for its background , its prime focal goal , the place to which he was forever rushing , the place his father had only known as a bum in meek stumbling uplooking approach or had more vigorously known in his youth but that was Des Moines and long ago , ( 7g ) nothing less and nothing more than the redbrick wall behind the red neons : it was everywhere in Denver where he went and everywhere in America all his life where he was . It was in the secret dusty place around the corner of the frontwall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , actually in the alley or area between buildingsno more than a foot wide or floored by anything but the most darkeneddebris of the city but it was illuminated by a nearby red neon and some from the poolhall below , it showed every furrow of the brick , it clicked sadly on and off with the lights  --  in the beauty parlor itself you could see the interior with its fathead shapes haunted by red and empty now , see through it in through the around-the-corner window that , like the wall , hid , as so many things in America on Main Streets and now even on bleak suburban streets that have chiropodists ' and lawyers ' offices near rectories and old houses with hooks over a defunct second-story door without stairs which is the old hayloft door and maybe a man in a roundpeak nineteenth-century hat was hanged from that hook , these things also hid behind the red neons of our frontward noticeable desperatelyadvertised life . The new loneliness that came to Cody with the coming of a suit and a topcoat was the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saturday morning on Saute Fe Drive , near the unbelievably exciting crossing of the D. &; R. G. railroad tracks that nudged a long smooth corridor through the lean and ticket of dumpbacks , junkpiles and hangbrowed fences for a solid mile , a place at least of wild playful promise where all you had to do was wear overalls ( like the can jungle place My Man Godfrey wanted to go back to after he got his fill of Park Avenue in a tremendously Hollywoodian naive Depression movie that was nevertheless naively true , the unspeakablevisions of the individual ) , the railroad track that swooped from the smear of dumpsmokes in the blue morning air cleanly and swiftly to the mountains of the mist , the green banks of another El Dorado , another Colorado , which was a loneliness that could be diverted by the actions of one hundred interesting grimy j unkmen laboring with tragic heavy importance among the skewered wrecks and rustpiles  --  the difference between this and standing in the middle of the winter night on a sidewalk that is not your home beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still summer but now on a redbrick wall which eschews a humid and perforated iciness of its own , corrupted , dank with winter , not the place to lean a lonely back and in spite of all this grimness inherent in it suggesting more than it ever could suggest in the summer and with infinite greater adult excitement than the dump a joy , but a joy so much stronger than the j oy of the dump that it was like the man 's need for whiskeysupplanting the boy thirst for orange soda and took as much troub1eand years to develop , the joy of the downtown city night . Great sign(79)posters set on top of low graveled roofs of bowling alleys and shining fiercely against the bare bald backs of windowless warehouses , or maybefilling the windowed eyes of a hotel with their sheens , the glitter and yet the hidden beyondish gloom of this drove Cody in his secretest mind as it has myself and most others to further penetrations into the interiorstreets , the canyons , the ways , so much like the direction music takes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make dreaming a tragic mystery ; and so seeking rushing all dreams into the heart of it , always the redbrick wall behind red neons , waiting . Something was there that Cody and I saw together in an alley in Chicago years later , when we parked a Cadillac limousine in an unobtrusiveblack corner , pointed it to the street ; that Cody saw a thousand times in the walls of towns of Iowa , Virginia , or the San Joaquin Valley ; something , too , that was namelessly related in his poor tortured consciousness to the part of the redbrick wall he had always seen from the smooth old waitingroom bench of the County Jail when his father had been arrested for drunkenness on Larimer Street probably with five or six others taken en masse from a warehouse ramp , waiting for his appearance before the judge to appeal to the court for some mete of mercy for his father , swearing he had n't drunk for a month before and soon making great childly speeches that sometimes astonished peopleand later was brought to the attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beast to aid the Beauty : the brickwall , always dully glowing from dark red to gray bleak red as a neon somewhereflashed , seen through a little barred window on the inside wall and where calendars depicting Indian maids in the moonlight with beads and exposed breasts drove Cody to wonder about the world that spoke of beautiful piney islands and Indian love calls and Jeannette MacDonald yet had nothing to show for it but jailhouses , arrested fathers , distant moanings , clocks tocking , and the one spike-driven sorrowof that red wall besmirched with lights that were intended for the streets for official passersby , but hid something behind for some sad and dishonest reason faintly related to what his father sometimes complainedabout ; and yet had the ability like any old brickwall of a factoryif you put a white unloading light on it instead of red of shining as forlorn as brown snow . Reaching into his pocket with that gesture , the topcoat flying behind him , see Cody hurrying into the heart of Denver with the same gleam in his eye you see on the fenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house-light reflecting garage but now wink to the wild neon of Main Street ; see him , sometimes in such a big hurry that it seemed the traffic light clicked green just for him and whicheverbuddy arm-in-arm with heads knocking in talk he sweeps along(80)with , twinkling ' round-corner in a vanish of heels , so they do n't have to stop at all but cut right along to the poolhall , levels of conversation to match the exciting joy , wham , barn , those voluminous talking-fogs whipping back like dialog balloons dissolving in wintry air , a sight ( again ) little Cody oft dug from that lonely Skylark winter window of his poor bumfather 's creaking in old chairs behind his watchpost dusty glass ; maybe as he rushes a bus-waiting girl , ( again ) , legs akimbo , watching him suddenly with that snaky sexy lovelike look and the kid 's saying to himself " So that 's what they been doin all this time the big guys and girls ( damn , damn , look at that Cadillac beat the light ! ) , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with dark glasses , a regular highheel downtown Denver broad ; see Cody Pomeray trying to hurry into the heart of the great Denver evening that to him will find its obvious focus in the poolhallwhere sometimes the hour is so roaring that with the Tremont parlorbackdoor open you can see a solid block of poolhall through the two joints like looking down an endless mirror all cuesticks , smoke , green ; hustling to stab the heart of the night or be stabbed but always missing because it is not in the poolhall , or downtown further where the redbrickwalls lead further , glowing from blackracked neons into unspeakablesecret glittering centers where everything must be happening or at least give modified indication of where to go for it , show down what long dark lane and boulevard with its nameless forlorn corner ( the Fox and Hunt Bar ! ) where a neon light hidden behind further buildings is sending an aura of invitation and calling men to come and make their mothlike approach ( like the heroes of Dreiser whom he has hurtling like beetles against summer screendoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , umalum , umalum ) , and instead the whole night and everything it 'll ever give anybody besides death and absolute loss is to be found twelve , thirteen feet above Cody 's head as he rushes all eyes into the poolhall , either with Watson the big Virgil of the Pool hall Night with whom he shares the same robe of refined dissipatedexcitement everyone else 's dumb about , the shark and his boy , the stars of loungey interviews at midnight , like Miles and Lee Konitz cutting into a bar together , or , say , Ike and Harry Truman , or me and my boy into the union hall three thousand miles from home , or alone hankering ; twelve , thirteen feet up the redbrick wall and barely around the corner into the between-buildings alley , so tragic and hidden from the city , right there , the vision , what you get , what there is . To emphasize that it 's Saturday night some people bring boxes of chocolate that they buy in poor beat drugstores that have bedpans and jockstraps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian maid with beads but this time ( because dealing with ladies ' tastes and(81)palates , not rough crotches of cops ) no breast , makes it Saturday night truly ; Saturday night , which makes it entirely different that , as you walk by a drugstore with nothing to do and maybe a glum lack of interest , you see an ad for chocolate candy in the window  --  those selfsame boxes that used to have even more ornate Indians on them and women with longer beads framed in silverer moonlight  --  even the names are Saturday night sad , " Page and Shaw , " " Schrafft , " etcetera and all this is as connected to the meaning of Saturday night as those old syphilis movies of the Twenties showing a couple all dolled in evening clothes rushing uptown in a mad glitter of lights to a party ( where they get the clap or the syph and later , after Saturday night is over , they have a suicide pact in ordinaryweeknight clothes  --  ) ( this was an actual pix I saw and it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even then , aged twelve , wondered about the oldness of the film ) . Candy in fancy boxes , chocolate , it 's the only thing a drugstore that sells nothing else to eat will sell , the serious drugstores without sodafountains sell chocolate candy ; ice cream sodafountains , the fancy kinds that make their own ice cream and candy and have tile floor and jars of hard candy all spick and span and intricate like you might imagine old Vienna looked , they also sell boxed candy , have big displays of it , all brands and the boxes with their golden arrangement and ribbons and fancy lettering catch at my heart as I say with this unspeakable realization that it 's Saturday night  --  not only because the beau might tip his cap at the dismal door and present such a box , or because in a drugstore window otherwise made up of pans and rubber a lavender candy box sits humanly , sweetly , God-knows-whatly , dearly , dismally and the only person who 's aware of drugstores on Saturdaynight is necessarily alone and lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the special kind that makes iron fire escapes of the sides of theaters particularly bleak ) boxes of chocolate candy signifystaying at home in spite of festivities everywhere so-called , signify the speechless yearning to reach a hand across the abyss and in gentle self indulgence like that of the opium man across town behind drawn shades plop rich chocolates one by one into the mouth , listening , I 'd say , not to the Hit Parade but the Saturday night dance parade remote bandbroadcastsmost networks have ( while the woman of the house is ironing the fresh fragrant wash ) , in your bathrobe and slippers , preferably Chinesestyle , with the funnies . But Saturday night is to be best found in the redbrick wall behind the neons , it 's now infinitely bleaker than ever , like the iron fire escapes at the blind wallsides of those great fat movie auditoriums that squat like frogs in businesslike real estate are so much bleaker on Saturday nights , they cast more hopeless shadows . Saturday night is when those things that haunt us beyond our speech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crying to be(82)seen and noticed all around and we ca n't do anything about it and neither could Cody ; and to this day he , older and after all this time , goes now haunted in the streets of Saturday night in the American city with his eyes torn out like Oedipus who sees all and sees nothing from the agony of having lived and lived and lived and still not knowing how to conjure from the pitiful world and the folks around some word of praise for something that makes him grateful and makes him cry but remains invisible , aloof , delinquent , complacent , not unkind but just dumb , the streets themselves , the things themselves of life and of American life , and the faces and hopes and attempts of the people themselves who with him in gnashing map of earth pronounce vowels and consonants around a nothing , they bite the air , there 's nothing to say because you ca n't say what you know , it 's a void , a Demosthenes pebble would have to drop way long down to hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say miles out on East Colfax , Cody , waiting for a bus , or a ride , would see the distant rust glow of downtown neons and be so impatient to get there at once that with his chin lifted to his goal he would walk fast in such intense get-there preoccupation ( in his topcoat pockets his fists pressed against his thighs for speed ) he 'd be like a man riding a wheel , a flat wood doll you hold in your hand and give the legs a blurry spin becausemiles from downtown was like the sudden tragedy I felt one Thanksgiving in Lowell when the family decided to go to the movies and though it was the biggest event that I could 've wished for I said I 'd stick to my regular Thursday night YMCA exercise gymn class and yet when I got to the Y steps , even before my father 's old Plymouth was vanishing in a wink of red light as exciting as the red neons up against the Kearney Square buildings and Chin Lee Restaurant five blocks down and around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I realized it was Thanksgiving and there was no gymn class ( and so ran through shortcut railroad canal bridges among cardboard crates and mountains of millrags blue with dye , straight for the red walls of movie street as though , clutching my throat , only there I could ease the horror which had suddenly lifted me in the air in a dreamy realization that I was going to die ) , Cody feeling that way on lesser impulses most likely and maybe wasting his , dissipating his last dime on a wild promiscuous trolley ride that plummeted him in , and he ran to the poolhall , and nobody was there , it was closed for repairs or Thanksgiving , and always as he stood there on the sidewalk beneath the redbrick neon wall , thinking , unthinking , a cop cruiser came around the corner in a flash of evil two-toned black and white with shiny antenna and the growl of the radio and he turned away , he moved along , he had hurried for this and always for nothing more than this . His father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows of hotels that had red neons , in fact with that same grave careful floppyhat adventurous sorrow beneath the redbrick glow wall looking straight ahead with his eyes moist in the moon , but Cody was ambitious to conquer the world of men that existed up there in the shadowsbehind the swarming gloom in back of the neons that spread like brickdust softly exploding red and then dark again . . . and somewhere on the main drag a man hurrying across the street to serious business . When on rainy nights Cody happened to have fifteen cents for a bowl of noodle soup with rye bread and one pat of butter in some diner downtown , and sat there by the window with a stolen newspaper , and saw , through mediums and worlds of dark steel , concrete , and wetsplashed tar , through populations of parked cars beaded silver in the light from the diner and passing buses and Railway Express trucks and iron fences , through arches of nameless overpasses that for all he knew through the diner 's silver reflecting window were the overpasses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in a dream suddenly fished from loving infancy , he saw , barely saw , two blocks away , the deep bloodred neons of some bar and restaurant winking against the distant brownbrickof its building with subsidiary blue moons of neons that said Sea Food , Steaks , Chops , saw the thing agitating in otherwise gloomy city darkness more like the darkness he knew in the backass bridges and meatpacking porches of Wazee and the railroad tracks and agitating with a comfortable little message of joy to anybody who had the money or knew the people there to come on in and enjoy the shelter , the sea food , music , the waitresses , the hot hissing radiators , he wanted to go and be with it and go gabbling among humanities and not just meander in a blind chagrin like his Pa . It was like he wanted to penetrate and know the poolhall . Leaning his head on his hand at two o'clock of Monday morning in that diner and staring that neon , he thought , " And now , unlike Satnite when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sausages at thirty-five , and the fried onions with order at five , then the cream cheese sandwich at fifteen , and that gal with the marcelled hair in the green coat was making googoo eyes at me and I thought by gawrsh it was going to be one big dinger of a night and so and so but now , now , now , now and time has flown and rolled ah me and this pair of rubbers developed a hole sinst , now it 's Sunday night or should I say Monday morning ( yawn ) and now for me to cut over there and eat the blue chops only the ops of which I can see in blue thar with the gaspump hiding the ch and my rubbers leaking I go over that pattering shiny rain that ai n't interessed in my mother or me and never has to do with anything but where it falls and maybe I slide in oilslick and go off that high curb , jump over the puddle as only I can , on tiptoe , zoom across the middle island , zoom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulbs and down through that part that I ca n't see to that bar that starts town with a bloody(84)light separatin this edge from general restaurants and bars of Denver as I go along , but here really if I 'm going to die why do I get to feel so good and how come I feel so good so often anyhow , I do n't even figure with any exactness what my next shoes will be bought out of , it 's all fine and good to sit in a diner and enjoy soup and papers and looking out the window but sonofabitchgoddamn if that coat had n't been given me I 'd be freezin this winter and where the hell have they put my father with all their lousy systems of lopping and laying away people , I 've got a long long ways to go before I get to that hard bed in Johnson 's buddy 's attic , and a climb to boot , and in the rain , and my eyes are hot , and I ai n't got ta belt , and finished my soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops of chops right now .

"  --  outside his windows , which are gleaming red in the mad Denver afternoon , young assistants of state senators and pretty mink secretaries of 17th Street are rushing by and suddenly one pitiful raw ranch hand , to some nameless point that all the whole city twenty square miles of it squeezes and contracts in one speechless huge star-shaped bat-ribbed air nerve to locate and centralize  --  there , and there alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important dinnertime in Denver  --  but not only the most important , the one most reminding of the joy of the crib , the answer to all the countrified American crying in the wilds .

It was years later before he found(86)the answer in the little nameless second when , after meeting Joanna in a sodafountain and taking her to the Ouray Hotel , Tremont corner fifth floor room , and turning from his pants on the chair to go on with what he was saying to her his future wife as she spread her thighs experimentally on the faded pink bedcover , a beauteous creature of the first order with long ringlets and curls and only incidentally fifteen at this time he saw in the act of swinging his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing on the redbrick wall just outside the window , saw this in a fraction through the little dirty thin muslin curtain that billowed in the drafts of steam from the silver radiator which was also slightly roseate from the neon , the dirty sooty sill also almost rusty lit from the glow , a scrap of paper one hundred feet off the snowy ground suddenly swirling past in the January nightwind , the whole big flat window rattling , the neon coming and going on the brick , the poor hidden brick of America , the actual place that you must go if you must bang your head to bang it at all , the center of the grief and what Cody now saw and realized from all that time the center of the ecstasy . SLIM BUCKLE WAS A GREAT BIG figure going down those Denver alleys between the rickety backs of houses that were completely suburbanand respectable out front with lawns and sprinklers because the heat of the plains sun turns the grass brown , striding with bowed head in some kind of tremendous concentration of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that once you 've seen them you wonder why they did n't have them in your neighborhood they 're so exactly like home , they remind you of Saturday mornings when you were six and knew the day was young and blue just by lookingover the fence through pale smokes of whoever it is is always burningsomething on Saturday morning ( and hammering on nails in the afternoon ) . In fact Buckle went through these alleys ( en route to the poolhall ) with his hands in his pockets like Sad Sack but whistling like Genet 's Alberto at his gayest , a way of walking and whistling when he was a little kid and scrabbled after others in a calm universe of his own that he carried around to wherever they wanted to go , spitting silentlythrough his teeth and probably like Lousy over the waving grasses of afternoon in some occasion when the gang had fainted under a tree and was too lazy to play jackknife or call others over beyond the fence .

Assured by the basement I went out into cold night and cut ( deep in thought of something till I crossed Seventh Avenue ) then , as usual , turned to look at Danny 's window and imagined everybody in apartment which is so eternal , we 've all seen it so many million times in death , everybody watching me , curling their lips " There he goes now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk and stupid .

So I packed all night , just desk papers , and that 's the horrible sad thing  --  my dark glasses of the hospital , okay ( given to me by jovial veterans ' committees ) ; my reading glasses twelve dollars when I sold my book ; my machine shrouded now for good , I ca n't take it with me , I remember the day it came home on Sarah Avenue when Pop lost his business and I started right in with stories about Bob Chase owner of the New York Chevies and typed up the summer league ( Gulf , Tydol , those namelessly sunlit names on purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissipating in the refinement of sunlight in the entire operation of the league ) ; that machine , that the poor spastic flayed , and now everybody knows it fromH from the C , that machine my father himself wrote on , editorials , letters ( the trouble with life is that it has its own laws and controls the souls of men without regard for their least wish , and this is slavery ) ; my Harcourtad that Deni Bleu proudly wants and will see tomorrow ( and how will Deni receive me now ? ) ; my little erasers , the round one which I 'll bring , the soft straight one which I 'll leave , all this matters to me like State , it 's vaster than Assemblies ; the poor pipe ( Pop 's ) and pipe rack I can never use again , which is reminder of change ( no more smokes ) more than anything else in my tragic coffin of a desk tonight : 0 the child of the Phebe livingroom with his first vision of the marbles , did he come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old Faulknerian desk from a Southern mansion , Nin and Luke birthday gift 1950 , when birthdays were birthdays and not anniversaries of guilt and culpritude ) ; the sales slip , Ma had just bought me new crepesole shoes for home here and nowI have to lay them down on foreign ground when she had intended them for Radio City or her first pitiful sight of U.N . building ; Lord please protect your tender lambs ! if you ca n't do that then bless them , bless them  --  my blue Eversharp pencil also from hospital , with which I started that great diary that temporarily saved me and started the internationalspectral and now lost Duluoz of the Dolours ; a bundle of recent letters , tied , with pathetic messages from the good hearts of the world including June and it 's as though I was battling black evil birds tonight and not anything human , something that the Devil sends , not the world , and the great black bird broods outside my window in the high dark night waiting to enfold me when I leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully by sheer animalism and ability and even exhilaration , so goodnight(94)And to go on and I meant to tell everything about my departure , only way to do it one by one the haunting things of this breathing life  --  Roy Redman of Clyde Lines , who is a curly colored guy working as attendant at Kingsbridge V.A . Hospital and reminds me not powerfully etc. but exactly of my sister in his every bemused method of , say , watching television , forgetting what you just said , the same lips too ( nothing feminine ' bout him at all and especially nothing Uncle Tom Negro ) and who was one of the hardtime organizers of the N.M.U. back in the Depression when seamen were bums to be attacked by cops on old inky waterfronts of early Path &; Newsreels and you saw clubs flying , well you saw this Roy Redman , he signs his name " Red " with quotes , and in parenthesis , like this , ( Clyde Line )  --  he wrote me a letter of introduction to the VPpresidentof N.M.U. , beginning " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of mine , Jack L. Duluoz . I will consider it a personal favor to me if you can see your way clear to extend any courtesy or considerationwithin your power to him .

Everybody believed and trusted in Red at the hospital , just to see him sometimes you 'd shiver joyfully in your chest especially if it was night and the fights were coming on in Televisionand everybody sat around , with Red , only for a moment off work , saying , " Who 's oan tab to-night ? " with that very nameless drawl that he developed and took with him probably round the world ten times in the great night of ships and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and one dewy morning I observed him in a new light from the window of my ward by watching not him but other colored men coming in to work where they lost their Negro street personalities and became attendants , trying to imagine Red on the street in Harlem or wherever or even in Ralph Cooper 's hip nightclub , how he would carry himself in that great challenging parade which is the American Negro Sidewalk of the World . So there 's that letter of intro  --  and I 'm taking with me the little tiny handsizedBible I stole from that Fourth Avenue bookstore in the used religiousbook section at the back because I thought the guy was a cheat in his bargainings with me over the exchange of new textbooks for used books , the Bible that I read only once or twice the print is so small and the big occasion was in Mexico City when in the incredibly warm glow of my lovely checker-cloth beside the soft goof lovely bed , well fed with midnightcheeseburgers from the Insurgentes lunchroom or just newly high , sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeps that in MexCityon T were never equaled in sheer sweetness and LOVE except on(95)sleeping pills recently at Kingsbridge ( in fact I dug Red Redman on goofballs , that is , just watched his face , many anight before I fell asleep in fleece ) , I was on that bed-edge maybe with a smidgin of sweet vermouth , maybe Sherman was high in his room or gone , but I happened to pick up this midget New Testament Bible and in my huge-hearted state of high love I saw the great words ( at eight thousand feet above sea level ! ) and was so amazed with almost every sentence or that is line I saw that I felt attacked by words , overtaken by great blows of consciousnessI should have absorbed a long time ago , realizations of Jesus I 'd never dared before , Jesus as a prophet and his political necessities and positions as a prophet , including charmed and awed interpenetrations of the mystery of the Bible and especially of ancient Jewish need in rote , till I fell asleep , in balms , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of the wide wide water and of strife , but then I thought about the fleecy lulls of the Eternal Lamb and so perhaps one stormy night in the Indian Ocean that I read about in old Argosy magazines of 1933 when I thought the sea had shrouds and heroes only , I 'll look at my little hand Bible , holding it over my face on the bunk , and a newer further diving into the awfulness and beauty of the Great Bible will happen to me  --  ( Behold , your house is left unto you desolate )  --  Oh so !  --  I 'm taking that with me , and the little tattered red French dictionary sitting under it in my poor rolltop cubbyholes , I 'll need it in Marseilles and Le Havre and Algiers and to read Genet  --  What kind of journey is the life of a human being that it has a beginning but not an end ?  --  and that it gets worse and worse and darker all the time till time disappears ?

I 'm going to present Den his scarf . 0 reader just follow me blindly into the hell and gone !

EN ROUTE TO STATEN ISLAND in the rainy dawn I walk rapidly on balls of my feet like a Cody heading for work and remembering Washington1942 and other dawns when workmen stand in doorways , nothing else could have reminded me of a special series of going to work hot-eyes dawn and general strange manly sensation  --  passed Crossbay Boulevarda rainy green alley towards the sea , only saw it last minute looking up from Daily News , Ah me  --  Oh Lord  --  Now the gray rooftops of Brooklynas I head for the ship that has been flying towards me in the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rickety outer Brooklyn  --  We make the same big famous curve ( on El ) that I first made June 1943 at a time when , twenty-one , I should have kept on going to sea , at a time when I thought I was old and had syphilis ( warts )  --  When Pop was alive and would have been proud of my manly seagoing which only now almost nine terrible years later I acknowledge to his grave which is also under this great rain that extends in mist to the tragic rainfields of Nashua where my brother 's lost wails sleep and new autos roll in the slick road that I saw the day of his funeral 1926 , year of Cody 's birth  --  The big ship at eight is due to be warped in at Pier 12 Army Base , the Pres. Adams  --  Tall , French , sad , whooping Deni Bleu will be standing among tangles of wires in the engine room when they inform him that chagrined J.

STATEN ISLAND , six million things inundating my brain  --  Sitting in the little diner outside Army Base , watching sharp Negro cats with suitcases , and Puerto Ricans with coats , taking quick shot drinks at bar , who 're cutting off the ship for kicks , maybe the Adams  --  a gray exciting Atlantic day again but now a wild one connecting me namelessly with Oakland and the time I went there on Bay Bridge train for a reason I ca n't remember  --  also when I was with Den , at Golden Gate track , back across the land to here , Staten Island , to which I just arrived in the wild ferry where I chatted with a tanker seaman and dug planks and flotsam in water remembering the danger I faced foolishly in summer 1943 when I dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool  --  the same waters where corpses floated  --  a ferry in the grayness making you realize what a mad mind Jack London had ( strictly as a guy )  --  sitting in the window(97)of diner across gate to make sure Den does n't slip into New York  --  the Puerto Rican left , headed for two days of kicks in East Harlem fucking gone girls on Oriental bedcovers and eating yellow rice and beans con polio , the colored guy he 'll whoop at the Palm Cafe , these guys the sharpest workers in the world , more , say , than Cody , because traveling , and I am here in same moodway as Cody , fast , talk to everybody , no " dignity , " speed , kicks ( I only know , that is , I strictly know what I know and that 's why sketching is not for my secret thoughts  --  my own completelife , an endless contemplation , is so interesting , I love it so , it is vast , goes everywhere  --  ) And this gray day as I wait and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolded in Ozone Park and Brooklyn as I came over  --  but now it has gulls , wild hungers , voices of workers , figures crossing rainy supply dumps with umbrellas , black wires , poles , masts of ships , black forms of all kinds , a call from across the world and from the great gray mist of America and American things and wild smoke of boy headed for prepschool but so much more . BROWN HALLS OF MEN  --  now by God many hours and events later I am finally entrenched in the vision that I re-discovered my soul with , the " crowded events of men " only now it 's me , myself smack in it  --  at the moment , flush because I 'm going to start earning within a matter of hours I 'm having a huge fifteen cent beer in a bar off the waterfront but a brown businessman 's bar and at the hem of the financial district with Emil-like fathers and men drinking at long bar  --  I say " brown " bar not in jest , red neons or pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browned panels , the beer is brown , tabletops , the lights are white but embrowned , the tile floor too ( same mosaics as the barbershop in which I had visions of Cody staring ) . Now what I 'm going to do is this  --  think things over one by one , blowing on the visions of them and also excitedly discussing them as if with friends as I did last night joyously drunk in the West End ( see actually I 'm not old and sick at all but the maddest liver in the world right now as well as the best watcher and that 's no sneezing thing )  --  signs for Guinness Stout are namelessly brown  --  I 'm sitting in the backroom so as to think but I 'm in the whole brown bar and one of the men  --  All day I 've been amazed by the fact that I 'm a man and have the right to work for a living and spend my money as I see fit  --  I guess I 'm finally growing up  --  amazed with for instance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially the big mad colored cat cook who got up and blew a crazy speech that was like a tenor horn in its wild jump and pitches but of course compared to other speeches infinitely more real and joyous especially when he kept saying " Frisco , Frisco " and that is my mad dream , I want ( I 'll do anything ) to be on a ship that sails out of Frisco that supra-marvelous city of brown(98)bars and smoke and men and S.I.U. white-capped seamen 's halls and Cody and Buckle , the principals of the Denver poolhall , and Frisco poolhallsthemselves , the whole wild world of men in crazy smoky places includingthe M.C.S. Puerto Ricans who take us back past Adam and Eve to meetingplaces of the great Latin night that I dug in MexCity  --  Now , I 'm going to be interested in these things all my life but in order to really involve myself as a man on the other level of man-to-man communication I 'm also going to talk about these things with people if I can , like for instance Deni 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the Adams and is now replaced by wonderful goodnatured simple Joe-like guy ( a few beers gives a man the power to think like I 'm doing but too many robs you of the rest )  --  I 'm going to talk about these things with guys but the main thing I suppose will be this lifelong monologuewhich is begun in my mind  --  lifelong complete contemplation  --  what else on earth do I really know unless I 'm depriving myself of kinds of knowledge that would bring out those qualities in me which are most valuable to others ; not me , although I keep thinking what 's good for me is equally good for any of my intelligent friends  --  Last night in the West End Bar was mad , ( I ca n't think fast enough ) ( do need a recorder , will buy one at once when the Adams hits New York next March then I could keep the most complete record in the world which in itself could be divided into twenty massive and pretty interesting volumes of tapes describing activities everywhere and excitements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shape but a crazy big shape yet just as logical as a novel by Proust because I do keep harkening back though I might be nervous on the mike and even tell too much ) . These two days  --  well first , Deni did come out to meet me ( after those last thoughts in the lunchcart across the wire fence , recall ? ) ( now hear this Jack : the S.S.Pres . Adams has red lifesavers on a white rail , at night the water is dark behind them as you look from an eventful cabin of smoke , drink and talk through the porthole , and the lifesavers say San Francisco against these dark piers of the world , for Frisco and as I say about that Negro cook , is really the port of ports and for this therefore I 'm almost ready to decide to sail at least one four-month run on deck , as ordinary seaman , though I have a job waiting for me in the morning as bedroom steward on another ship , West Coast company but bound for France ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course I ca n't keep up but worse they 're as though they were fond memories that from my peaceful hacienda or Proust-bed I was trying to recall in toto but could n't because like the real world so vast , so delugingly vast , I wish God had made me vaster myself  --  I wish I had ten personalities , one hundred golden brains , far more ports than are ports , more energy than the river , but I must struggle to live it all , and on foot , and in these little(99)crepesole shoes , ALL of it , or give up completely . Now , outside this bar is a little park , I shall sit there , high ( on myself ) watching the last of the Wall Street blue lights in high windows , remembering the dream of me as a seaman walking right by these nameless lights where a man bends over a blueprint to visit a girl that I fuck , and actually I did that exact thing in 1944 when getting my Coast Guard pass for the run to Italy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beautiful soft , wet between-legs slam of Cecily Wayne and coming with a bulging head . Now life is great and tremendous and beautiful ; here at twentynineI feel like an old sick man ; but time has come for me to build myself up again ; and I will ; and I am happy for the first time in a long time . Picked up my last sixteen dollars at work today , phooey . I can make one run round the world on the Adams as O.S. deck ( the same dark ship that to me came flying in the night like Blake 's worm ) and then somehow , in Frisco port , switch to messman if I can , if not , switch to mess on another ship . The true story of merchant seamen is not only their drunks in ports , and adventures , and their work , but the huge universe of their complicatedconversations in Union Halls about ships in , ships out , papers , ferries , validations , dues , wives , beefs , passes , tricks , being late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ) But HOW am I going to keep my mind filled like this and incidentally also talk about everything with everybody first of which is Deni  --  by sober energies in the gray morning off gray Seattle . O BROOKLYN , Brooklyn where I have lived all these yearsDid they build a bridge straight into your heartAnd past that spectral stupid SquibbRaise airs of rosy night all for nothing ? but now to Brooklyn , this is like the night I watched Boston Harbor , same situation , and same distant lights but New York , vaster , seaward , with spectral rosy Brooklyn across the way but now I 'm stuttering like Tony  --  O sad night  --  0 waterfront ! PIER 9 , the Pres. Adams is my ship of destiny , it must be , I keep knowing everything about it ahead of time  --  I 'm waiting here in New Jersey before it 's even arrived and I know that a mountain of Four Roses whiskey is going on the Pres. A. to Yokohama and glassware to Hong Kong and machinery to Frisco and other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be picked up for the Venices and Triestes of the return swing round the world  --  but more of this later , i.e. , the cargo , the shed at Pier 9 , the enormous Erie railyard of the world , the truck ramps . Just now , in the Erie railroad waiting room ( same railroad that had such a rainy wilderness sound when that Old Ghost of the Susquehanna listed it among all the others in Harrisburg Peeay and the actual stops of which the announcer with a W. C. Fields lilt is now announcing but all the little New Jersey stops with names like Arlington and Montclair , not interesting wild names like Erie itself )  --  here in the station on a bench with arms I suppose to prevent bums from stretching out , I took a nap after calling Blackie , but of Blackie in a second . In my nap-waking I suddenly remembered that beautiful whore from Washington Mildred who stayed at Danny 's with sixty-year-old Madame Eileen that I screwed all night , and the morning Mildred came back from a night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took off her clothes , sat in the chair in her slip as I watched from Eileen 's couch ( smoking and just having had a morning marijuana forced on me by Danny ) lifted up the slip , which was black , grabbed her own cunt which Danny says is the greatest in the world because it squeezes your cock like a soft fist , and said " Old raunce need a ride . " If it had n't been for that T which only allowed me to goof and stare I would have done either of two things as I look back on it from my bench here in the Erie Railroad waiting for the Singapore-bound Presiden tAdams and my meet with Blackie the Bosun for my last chance to get on board the dark ship of destiny  --  Iwould have said to Eileen who 's her madame and old buddy , " Eileen fix me up with Mildred , " loud , with their peals of laffter rising , or I would have kneeled at Mildred 's feet and said " If you stroke that pussy too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuck did n't I do that !  --  how could I have passed up such a piece of ass !  --  what effeminacy , what narcolepsy has come over me from overstaying my " leave in Manhattan " from 1943 or even 1944 or worse 1939  --  a cunt like that and then we would have fucked sweetly in Danny 's red bedroom , I would-have said " 0 my God what a perfect saddle " and she 'd have said " Iffff , 0000 , drive it in daddy " and do n't you think I would ?  --  with old sinister Eileen , naked , sixty , white all over , tall , bellied but well breasted , watching closely every movement of interlocked limbs and with a look like that look of madames in dirty books ( in fact we 'd been lookin at dirty books all morning , photos of Paris 1910 the best one beinga guy in spats and hat ramming his finger into a woman 's cunt as he bends her back , dress up , over an ironing board ) , that careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensualyou can come just by looking at them . So I vow to hit Washington next go round the world ( if I get on theAdams and if I do n't all this waiting(101)will have ironic uselessness although I will be managing to get round the world in a less direct way , ship by ship willynilly ) and look up Eileen and Mildred , dig gone whorehouses of congressmen , fuck , eat , drink and see my former landlord and maybe even introduce Mildred to him just for kicks and as if I was pimping so as to surprise him and make him think that 's how I get my dough because he would tell her whatever he knew about me . These were my thoughts as I woke from this refreshing little nap and I needed it . Last night at home I talked with Ma , promised to take her to a show and dinner ( I pick Sweets for this ) before I leave ( if I can ) and hit sack at eleven , woke up at four restlessly , hurried to Jersey City in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable whitecollar Queens commuters who swoon in stuffy trains not only going but coming from work , five days a week , all for comfort and habit while I endure it only once ( it was my very first morning ride on the citybound E , and this after two and half years in Richmond Hill ) for the sake of Singapore  --  then , at Chambers Street , I dashed out to hit the nine o'clock call in Marine Cooks &; Stewards and there was no Adams job so I dashed back , hit the Tube , got off at Exchange Place , mistake , re-routed in a complicationof tokens and refunds with refund slips , elevators , ramps , got off at Erie Station , followed signs through the waiting room halls to the footbridgethat 's just like the one in This Gun For Hire with Alan Ladd ( a pix incidentally that I saw the afternoon before I signed on for Arctic Greenland in 1942 , when I lay in the grass of Boston Common thinking of death because then it was torpedoes and war and certainly no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in his smoky newspaper office ) , a footbridge over a solid halfmile of ( almost ) tracks with boxcars that Alan Ladd jumped into and are from all over the raw American land lined up facing North River with all its barges , tugs , piers , smoke and ships and theone huge green shed of the American President Lines that says " Far East " on it , boxcars that say " Route of the Phoebe Snow " and " Canadian Pacific " and remind me of Cody , his old man , Nebraska , gray day in Denver right now and raw men with big hands standing under foggy trees right now in the Far West or just soogeeingRailway Express cars in the railyards of Portland , Oregon or Kansas ( as I think this , to my left is a big sign the kind that advertises plays and Radio City in railroad stations clear to Boston and Lowell , and this one tells of AFFAIRS OF STATE with June Havoc , written by none other than Louis Verneuil , the same I met at age eighteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shortly before I worked for New York Central R.R. dragging mailbags across le grand plancher sale . . . the big dirty floor . . . and French is so simple , a job I remembered so vividly last spring when we left Ma alone and I began reviewingall the jobs I ever had in this earth of labor and sorrow , thinking(102)to myself " The night is my woman , " the same Verneuil who was in his dressing gown , had dark rim glasses and apparently since then has been going along successfully for they call it a " comedy smash ! " ( according to Garland of Journal American , the same I read during hamburg-sizzlingsuppers of home in New York that are now no more ) and so while I struggle in the dark with the enormity of my soul , trying desperately to be a great rememberer redeeming life from darkness , he calmly goes along filling in forms like plays and making name and money and with same Gallic coolness he displayed when I delivered that envelope to his apartment with the glittering Gershwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York which flared briefly then and also at Marshell 's party in a penthouse on Central Park West near Winchell 's but never to flare up again ) ( and Marshell being that New York hero who takes two girls to the nightclub with " Daoulas " in the abortive attempt to resume the writing of the Vanity of Daoulas back in the city of desires ) and since then banking down a flame of dreams into this bottomdark night from which at the last possible minute I now make my EXCAPE back to the sun of decks and the dewy mornings under Guam trees like the trees of the Marine base in Portsmouth , New Hampshire with Joe and the French-Canadians building a fence , back to the sense of life I had as a child uncomplainingly getting up at seven in the morn to go to school and on Saturdays joyously to go play , back to the open air of the world , out from dark enfer New York where , if a pine tree stood it would only stand in Rockefeller Plaza with bulbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or galley from rosy morn or from piney dews . The footbridge overlooks miles of railyard and some of it is overgrown with brown weeds , unused tracks , nameless smoke-puffings far off at the other side , sooty mudground , views of New York across the Hudson , then the Pier and the place where the stevedores are waiting by the adjustable gangway one hundred feet spectrally over the water of the slip for the President Adams to come in at one , as soon as barges are gone , a platform I leaned out of to check the river to see if P. A. was coming but found out , calling ship at Staten , it was n't even shifted yet , a platform like something I dreamed and I kept thinking of diving off , continually , till at one point ( all the time positive I could handle the dive and live , easily ) I thought the frantic secret thought over a barge and as I pictured myself falling through the air I tried to fight the air , squirm , so as to fly off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the futility of that ! , this platform reminding me I dun no why of the dream of the enormous apartments in the ParamountBuilding , I guess the hugeness of it , who ever heard of a warehouseplatform one hundred foot off water and of a shed a quartermile long . It took me ten minutes to penetrate the shed ; lines of trucks were(103)winding up the ramp and going in , some of them the huge trailer trucks of Georgia , one said " Ruby S.C . and Atlanta " and I said " South Calina aa-haa ! ! " Big crates everywhere , for instance veritable mountains of Chianti crates ( just got in )  --  and most of the crates , barrels , boxes , bags , rolls , etc. said Pres. Adams on them with the destinations , and they were as I say , " S.F. , Yoko , Kobe , Manila , one Malayan port I ca n't even pronounceor recall , Hong Kong , Singapore " and that 's all , no sign of further ports like Karachi or Suez , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on and if as deckhand , well , I 'll keep thinking of William Faulkner , make myself a man , like him the boiler factory , work the lard off my belly and lines off my pasty cheek . If I do n't make it , goodby Singapore and Den and the red lifesavers , the same lifesavers that struck me so deeply like a dream that only they alone now seem to be assurance from my pyschic future-sense that I will get on ! Blackie sounded like a real friendly intelligent guy on the phone , he 's bosun or carpenter , the delegate on the ship , S.I.U. , I will make friends , work hard , I meet him , or that is yell for him from the gangway at one o'clock in the huge green pier over the footbridge from here . . . the pier of the world , at the foot of the railyard of the world , across the great Wolfean river from the World City , and huge spectral awe in the early morning air and workmen who do n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely conspiracy to enjoy life as much as they can . En route I 'll watch from the footbridge : ( but further events ) . MISSED IN NEW YORK , I missed the boat , the O.S. and the B.R. jobs were both snapped up by bookmen and I stood there in the pier watching the Adams warp in with a feeling that I 'd miss . So now Deni says I must stick it out and follow the President Adams overland to San Pedro , Calif. where it arrives Christmas Eve and the Chief Cook Antonio writes me a letter to the union agent so I can snap up the fireman 's mess or anything else in steward 's department  --  and so the plot thickens for now I 'm going to follow the dark destiny ship and do so ON THE ROADThinking this on cardboard boxes that are stenciled for Hong Kong .

" The drowsy shed , the racket of winches , the smell of cinnamon and oil , the whine of trucks , the smell of coffee beans ( a mad Iongshore truck going backward among cities of produce thirty miles an hour )  --  Almost four , everybody 's knockin off and I 've missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and am sunk , doomed again for the goddamn road , Den will lend , I go to Cody'sOn footbridge , and now the sun 's going down on another mad day of mine at the hem of the Adams , going down in a big red ball that blinds over the boxcars ( Boston &; Albany , M.D.T. , a faded khaki wood car , Chesapeake and Ohio , El Capitan ) , over hundreds of boxcars on tracks extending from the impossible smokes of intown Jersey City where I can see a big white neon frame Davis Baking Powder to where the sun is setting over black grimes and further entanglements and gatherings of steel that are lost in a rosy distance behind the sun , including one faint crazy **25;14402;TOOLONG steeple  --  white smoke , black smoke , hundreds of cars of workers everywhere parked , the huge scene of Erie , the old buswagon hotdog trucks , two of ' em , below , men with grimy caps coming up the footbridge steps , the footbridge extends along the waterfront , the actual oily wet waters which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozed and beyond which I am now going in this mad immense dusk toget two cases of Budweiser in cans to be drunk tonight in Den 's cabin with cook , first engineer , etc .

So , ah , and one day somebody came up to  --  somebody was sittin there  --  and it 's started RAINING . . . THAT 'S WHAT IT IS ! When he came in the room , and everybody was high , and he 's staring into space ? It started to rain and thunderCODY . Oh y-e-s , phew ! JACK . Thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctJACK . He said " Wal , I guess I brought the rain with me . " CODY . Oh man , like that guy in " Lil Abner , " Gloom , goes around , with the rain comin down on him ? Irwin told you about that ? about an actual happening ? JACK . That 's the story he told meCODY . I never could remember it at allJACK . He said June told him thisCODY . Oh yes , " I guess I brought the rain with me .... " JACK . The type June would have remembered , see ? And I remembered the other story about a horse ? And old Bull was practicing with a shotgun ? CODY . Yeah , . I was there JACK . " Hey , the redcoats are comin ! "  --  and he sticks his gun out the window and shootsCODY . Yeah , I was there , yeah JACK . Why  --  why did he shoot ? CODY . He did n't stick it out the window , we was all sittin on the porch , Huck is playin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bull 's sittin there on the porch with his rifle ' cross his knees , see , sittin there like this , and we 're  --  I 'm sittin there , and that 's  --  so when he says . . . somethin like that , he did n't say that at all , what he does , I do n't remember that , he might have said somethin , but , the horses , I 'm sittin there stoned , and I look up , and here 's Bull , C-R-O-W-S-H , at a dead treestrunk , which he thought see , for kicks , he 'd shoot the treetrunk , see , there was a big treetrunk , it was about a hundred yards away , fifty yards , seventy , about fifty yards , yeah , seventy , sixty yards , and , ah , it was rotten , see the treetrunkwas rotten , you know the rest of the story , you know , the ball went through the treetrunk , it was rotten like paper ( baby cries ) JACK . YeahCODY . See , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it at that time . Of course Bull ca n't SEE , what really happened the horses were fifty yards away , you know by now , when the report sounded , but Bull ca n't see and he thought he hit the horse , or he knew he came damn close you see with this aimin at this trunk , so he goes " Hey I hit the horse ! " and he jumps up , you know , says " Oaiy ! " and he jumps off the porch , hee hee , the horses are trottin right along , he has n't touched nothin see .... Here 's this Bull , he 's so high , he 's just sittin there with his bad order high , see he ca n't see a hundred yards , y'know , that sonofa-(122)hitch , no wonder he hit June and killed her , imagine , no shit , he ca n't see with them glasses . . . . Why we drove to New York , it was so awful , a truck or anything would be anywhere near him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd put on the brakes like this see and pull over to the right hand side of the road , just like an old woman , not because he ca n't drive or nothing  --  but he ca n't SEE , no kidding ! I dug that ! So we made an agreement that I 'd drive all night and everything and if he ever wanted to drive or anything why sometimes he 'd drive in the afternoon an hour or two .. . so . . . that 's what he did . . . but , he 's , ah , crazy , man , that Bull , hee hee hee . . . . Phew ! naw , but man , what I 'd tell you is , I did n't know that I 'd appreciate remembering these things more , so therefore when I was there I did n't pay much attention to any of this , I was hung up on something else , you know , so I ca n't remember , say , like for example , I can remember NOW for example , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , because ... man ... I ca n't get it down . You know . . . I just remember it , I can remember it well , what happened ' cause I 'M not doing nothin , see ? JACK . You do n't have to get it downCODY. ( demurely downward look ) But I ca n't remember what happenedthere , man , except I remember certain things .... But I 'm sayin like Huck , me and Irwin goin out in the middle of the Louisiana bayou on a particular New York kick  --  now this is one time , now I 'm really  --  Huck , you remember how he is ... so Huck 's sayin " Come on , man , I want to show you something "  --  he 'd  --  and Irwin  --  he and Irwin were that way a great deal , Irwin would say " You 've got to see this piece of cloth , " and II uck 's sayin " Man you 've got to see something , ever since you been down here I been telling you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because what had happened , Huck ... had gotten high one day and we were cuttin through this forest vine place , it 's only about oh a half-mile behind the house , really , about a mile , no one ever goes over there you see , and it was an impassable bayou that he 'd dug the flowers and the gone colors and he was so high , see , jungle stream , and everythin comin down , and crocodiles and everything in this goddamn swamp that 's right beside . So he 's going to take Irwin over there , so we go on over there , and we lit up , you know , to make it just like we 'd do , we 'd be sittin there , " Come on , I 'm gon na show you this now , " you know ... " Well alright . " And so we all blasted and we went there and we sat there , so what happened , you know , as far as happenings go , but I remember that , Old Huck wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on those bayous , whereas , really it was about fifty yards from where we 'd bathed every day . And we did see a corner of the thing , whatever he was talking about , anyhow , every day . . . we 'd go down and bathe . One day June said " Well come on(123)if you 'll take us down to bathe , " Bull sittin there and he looks up over his glasses , you know , the way Bull looks up to June . Man , relationship completelya stone wall between me and June , as far as that goes , see , although I do n't want to be that way , naturally , but I mean I 'm not , ah  --  so like a young schoolkid I say " Well now , I 'll leave you down there , then I 'll come back , say , then I 'll go down and pick you up say in twenty minutes or something , " like a stoop see but man there 's nothing I can do , and June did n't say yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why we sat and talked for a few minutes , and I say " Well I guess I 'd better get back , " why , ' cause she 's startin to go down and get undressed there , in the pond , you know , and the pond is right there every day , you lay up there in the pond with the fishes hittin you in the ass , y'know , man they 're a terrible feelin when you 're high , you got ta get in this muddy old swamp water , see , and you got that little embankment there , see , but there that mud on the bottom in some places there , it 's pretty bad you know , and so you 're trying to relax , you know , set yourself down a little bit , and you just about get halfway settled , you know how sensitive you are , and here these fishes start biting at you , little fishes , man , just little things , you can see ' em , sometimes you ca n't ' cause you kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a sonofabitch , we 've all got bites all over  --  JACK . Who 's goin in there with you ? CODY . Oh me and Irwin , every day , we 'd goof off  --  JACK . What 'd Irwin  --  do  --  what 'd HE say about the fishes ? CODY . Oh he 's just sitting there squatting , he 's sitting there talking all the time JACK . He does n't notice those things  --  CODY . Yeah , and I 'm trying to lay down , you know , and so , Jesus Christ man , that 's a fuckin high place , that Texas , that 's high , you know , it 's not low , down there , sonumbitch , phew ! Ah man , Old Bull I said to him , " Well Bull " I said " maybe I better go out and get a job here , " you know , imagine , there 's no jobs , you have to work in the fields like a nigger , man , with the heat so hot , man , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alright Cody , you do n't have to go to work , " so , I 'm there , that 's wonderful , I say to him " That 's fine , I wo n't go to work . " JACK . Jesus Bull 's wonderful , huh ? CODY . Yeah , shit , sonofabitch he  --  he do n't do that no more , I do n't know what 's the matter with that guy , man , every day we 'd have to drink one case at least of Coke , half a case or more of Seven-Up , and about a half dozen bottles of various little punches , sodas , see . . . June was drinking all the time . . . like that , and Huck , June and Huck both ( swinging drinks in ) ( 124 ) JACK . Really blasting it , huh ? CODY . Yeah , blast punches , that 's right , and , of course , every day , speaking about other things , that was n't what I was going to talk about , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we 'd got all the gin out of the local stores so we had to go into another town to the BIG drugstore and liquor store to buy . . . the gin and the rum and all that stuff that Bull drankJACK . And tequilaCODY. ( temporarily hearing " Nakatila " ) No ... Oh , yeah , terrible !  --  that guy , he 'd  --  phew !  --  just sit there and drink ( both laughing , high ) , man . . . he would n't do NOTHINGJACK . Why that sonofabitch , he was in Berlin once ! CODY . About ten-thirty A.M. , man , he 'd show up out of his room , see , he 'd retire early about eight-thirty , then about ten-thirty A.M. he 'd come out of his room all dressed complete with tie and everything , he 'd come and he 'd sit down , " Good morning , any mail yet Cody ? " and I 'd say " No I did n't go for the mail yet , " and so , and he 'd say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair , man , right there a minute and he 'd start reading his mail , first thing in the morning , reading a newspaper or something , and if he felt good why he 'd be talking to June " Well I see Peaches Browning got another divorce here , " and June 'd be " Yeah yeah " in the kitchen , you know , right over the embankment is what it was , see the kitchen 's there and there was just a little half wall , so they 'd be lookin at each other , and , but if he was n't feeling so good he 'd just sit there JACK . And he would n't say nothing ! CODY . In the meantime Old Huck , he 's been out gathering firewood cause he 's used all the firewood everywhere around so he 's packing it , man , from a quarter half-mile away , here he is , Old Huck , Bull would  --  building himself up , see , and he 's got this terrible disease of his skin , man , what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and holes everywhere , no one knew what it was , even the doctors did n't k now , he 'd been to a doctor twice and they did n't know what it was , some kind of skin disease , never heard of , but , imagine , so everybody 's leery of Huck , see , poor Huck , nobody'Il go NEAR him and he 'd go bathe by himself down in the crick ' n ' everything . But I do n't know if that 's the case but it seems to me , it does n't seem like it 's usually been now as I rememherbecause I was n't thinking about those things , I certainly was n't hungup on that , but it seemed to me June was the instigator of all this , " Better watch out for Huck , " you know . . . JACK . YesCODY . " He 'll give you that fungus bungus you know , " it 's a fucking ( 125 ) thing , but what I 'm saying is that Huck he 'd have the firewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was getting dark , you know , he had to have plenty of firewood to get good and hot , oh he was alwayshungup on his firewood you know , he was always talking about firewoodJACK . Huck ? CODY . Huck wasJACK . What it LOOKED like ? CODY . No , he was always TALKING about it , " Oh got ta go git some firewood , " complaining about it , you know JACK . Just had the word firewoodCODY . Well yeah , you know , he had to get all this damn wood . . . what I 'm saying , that , I can remember him several times distinctly walking a long distance under his wood . . . and also complaining about it .. . and also feeling a big release and relief when he got to go into Houston and I got to drive him in . That 's sixty milesJACK . HmmCODY . Man , and he 'd sit down and he 'd be talking about this and that , man , he 'd be happy as a little kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' cause we had stripped all the Benzedrine out of every store everywherearound including Huntsville the state pen and everywhere , you know man , and so we had to go , we finally got a place in Houston , drugstorewhere we 'd get a gross of it , a hundred and forty-four Benzedrine tubes , so we had to do that every two weeks , go into Houston and get a gross of benny for June , man . Oh Jesus Christ what a trip . . . . And pick up some Nembutals , man , that 's what that Huck was hungup on then , he was vicious too on that stuff  --  JACK . What he do ? CODY . Oh he was , ah , ah , how would you say it ?  --  vililifying everybody ; you know he was , ah  --  well him and June really were in the heights of a great feud , no shit , I really think so , because June was always " That Huck "  --  In fact it got so bad , I can remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supper table Huck would get hysterical , you know that never happens , and he 'd throw up his dish and go away , and Bull , he 'd " Ah , Huck , " you know .... But I 'm not digging any of this so much , I 'm on other things somewhere . . . JACK . What were you doing ? CODY . Oh I do n't know what I was doing , I ca n't remember man , it 's a terrible feeling not being able to remember what I was doing ( laughing ) . . . Jesus was I there , I do n't remember where I am but I think I(126)was there , sh  --  one time or another , damn that , Oh Christ , mmm ... . That 's an interesting question , what WAS I doing ? ( laugh ) What I was doing I think  --  the reason I do n't remember too wellJACK . All I know is what Irwin told me CODY . What 's that ? JACK .

( reading ) Yoohee , it 's like a line of poetry . Is that what you said , " bad order high " ? CODY . Yeah , meaning , no goodJACK . I put that in CODY . YeahJACK . But I did n't know that when I put it in CODY . Yeah JACK . Now go onCODY . Bad order , with his bad order not high but eyes . . . see , he 's got bad order eyes , he ca n't see , that 's what I 'm telling you , see JACK . Oh yeah ? CODY . I say ... " he ca n't SEE " JACK .

OkayCODY . Same thing though , it is here JACK . That son of a bitch . ( Cody laughs ) Look at that sonofabitchCODY . Yeah ( 132 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look " CODY . I seem to remember that myselfJACK . Although it was n't really CODY . NoJACK . It was my ideaCODY . YeahJACK . About the look you hadCODY . Well yeah . . . it was kinda of aJACK . But it apparently was n't . . . what you were really doing .. . CODY . That 's what it really amounts to , thoughJACK . Why , because lookit . . . the talk is far way from demure .. . CODY . Well , the reason for the demure is . . . any approach to the words like , as I remember like what I said . . . here , ah , " I ca n't get it down , " for example , you know , " I ca n't get it down "  --  Well , I approached that very terribly , I was talking you know about something you know , that  --  it 's goin on  --  You know what I 'm trying to say ? JACK . Hey ? ( suspiciously ) CODY . See ? Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now man , " ca n't get it down , " you know , and even as I say it it sounds awful , then also it sounds like struggling to get it down , and also sounds like whatever approach a young kid would , ah , approach with definite talk of getting it down , or in other words it might be an idealist who is no longer idealistic , and so he no longer wants to talk about ideals , y'know , and he does n't want to , you understand what I 'm sayin though do n't you . . . . And , so  --  that 's what I say when I say " I ca n't get it down , " and then ... " two minutes "  --  but you picked up on that , of all the different things I was sayin , and so you said , " But you do n't have to get it down , " you know , that 's what you said . . . and so the demure downward look . . . was simply in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as my reaction and feeling was when I said the words " but you ca n't get it down " you know JACK . Ah . . . you were demure when you were saying those words CODY . No , I said thisJACK . I do n't know why you were demure if you were demureCODY . I was demure simply because of the same reaction of those words , ' cause you chose " I ca n't get it down , " and I approached it with a hesitancy , you understand what I 'm sayin ? What I 'm saying is  --  JACK . I thought you were bein demure because when I said " You do n't have to get it down " . . . CODY . Yah ? ( 133 ) JACK . . . . you thought it meant , ah , that I was saying ... ah , you do n't have to write , see , I 'll write . You looked away demurely , guy 's saying " I got bigger muscles than you have " CODY . Yeah yeah , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I did n't dig it personally , I dug it , as a , like I say . . . ah , a remembrance of my own past , my own , you understand  --  it was all an inward thing  --  not outward , you understand . . . . So when I looked down demurely it was the same way as . . . ah  --  in my own self . . . I approached a word , just like when you hear a bad word , or see a poor word , or dislike some particular phrase . . . like some guys are hungup on disliking phrases . . . you know , like for example I can remember , the Okies , in this country , especially out herein California when they say something , like instead of saying it 's either one or the other , or something like that , they 'll say " Man ( cough ) I was either gon na shoot that guy , or beat him up , one ! " See , they use the word " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was either gon na do this or that . . . one way or the other but they always say " Man I 'm gon na hit him this or do that , one ! " JACK . So ? CODY . Well I 'm sayin , like when you come to dislike that phrase , the same way here , I come to dislike any concern about talking with the facts of " I ca n't get it down "  --  meaning ... generally , writing . . . or , whatever it is the object that JACK . You do n't like the phrase ? CODY . Not only the phrase in terms of phrase , but I mean the  --  in my own self when I approach the word ... or I 've come to dislike the phrase only ' cause it 's associated with the fact that ... I 'm talking about something I no longer want to approach , or am approaching properly . . . or , what I 'm saying is , you know . . . you have certain things inside your mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . . . what the way you want to be . . . caught talking JACK . Yeah yeah yeah ! CODY . Well that 's what I 'm meaning to say that when i say a word like that , or a phrase of that particular nature , so therefore when you picked upon that and said " But you do n't have to get it down , " half consolingly ... and also , still it 's kicks enough in itself . . . and so on . . . that 's MY interpretation . . . at the moment of when you said that , what you meant ... and so when I demurely look down there ... the concern ( cough ) was the remembrance of the reaction , ah , the thing that I had , ah , the same feeling that I had in me when I said the words " I ca n't get it down " came out in the downward look of half disgustingly . . . really having to approach a problem , or a concern  --  or something , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also that you 're not sure is exactly  --  in other words you know you 're a long way away from the problem , that 's what I 'm trying to say . . . . You know you 're out there someplace else where you really do n't want to be . . . you feel half disgusted at having to be out there . . . at the same time the demureness that comes into your expression is the  --  you know , it 's too  --  you just feel very  --  ah strangled , do you know what I 'm sayin , you feel veryJACK . Are you sure ? ( joking ) CODY . You know what I mean , you 're a long way out and . . . the demurenessis the , ahJACK. ( imitating Lionel ) How can you be so suah ? CODY.  --  is the opposite side of , ah  --  the demureness is the opposite side of , and the reverse feeling from , ah , and anger , demureness is a kindliness cast as a cloak over anger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shell for the inward frustration . . . which the anger is , you see , the anger is the internal anger , and the weariness that comes into the heart , unless you know that Jesus is always on your side . Now remember that ( paternally ) JACK . ( laughing ) I was trying to find Billie Holliday 's record of " Body and Soul " and put it on that jukebox there , plugged in  --  CODY . Damn thing , could n't find it JACK . Could n't find it CODY . Well you just played it an hour ago , two hours ago , three hours ago ( inhale ) JACK . Yeah , but purpose . . . of playing it at this moment was to evoke the musical soundCODY . Oh yes .. . JACK .  --  of the Texas that we were talking about last night CODY . Texas , whyJACK . See , that 's what I was doing over thereCODY . Yeah man , I know you were , you 've been  --  see , all the time I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this subject , why you 've been picking up and putting down those records and you went through the entire case of fifty . . . three times ! So that means lookingon both ( laughing with Jack ) sides of the record . . . three times would be a hundred and fifty times two , is three hundred times you moved your arm up and down and cast your glance up and back to manufacturesomething by finding  --  what if you have to do that all day , countless-ly twelve hours a day sun-up until sun-down with children that is with objects which have to be taken care of , see , automatic , and so you(135)have to go up and down three hundred times like that you know .. . every minute ' cause you 're always supposed to be doing somethingJACK. ( interrupting ) Oh if I really wanted to find it I 'd take them all out and stack ' em upCODY . Yeah ? JACK . No , I 'd go one by one but it 's not there CODY . YeahJACK . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you played it three hours ago , remember ? Hee hee . So it 's a mysh-tery . . . where could it have gone ? You would n't have unconsciously put it in an album ? But since you 've nevertheless  --  JACK . No I did n't do thatCODY . None the less I 'll do something like this , watch , I 'll just pull one out and I bet it 's Billie Holliday just to be vain , see ? Now I have n't looked at it you can tell , have I  --  and certainly I do n't intend to look at it , I 'm just trying to put this plug in , see , I 've been watching with my eyes , so you can see I 'm not cheatin and lookin . Awright . See . . . damn thing .. . ah I know , it 's too loose . Now I hope I  --  I hope it 's Billie Holliday ( both laughing ) Huh ? After you made three hundred motions .. . JACK . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready ? Wait till the volume gets a little loud . Because the best part about Holliday records  --  for example you know that " Them There Eyes " ( sings it , the riff intro , with little Texas up flip ) And then , you know after they do that twice , three times really , why then she starts singing ... but you know that opening ? Remember the opening ? The first eight bars ? Ready ? Billie Holliday ... ( MUSIC starts ) . I do n't know the name of it JACK . " Good Morning Heartaches " CODY . " Good Morning Heartaches , " yeah . ( laughing ) Good morning heartaches ! BILLIE SINGING : Good morning heartaches .. . JACK . What do you think of that ? BILLIE SINGING : . . . you old gloomy sight . . . CODY . Man , she just sits there . . . BILLIE SINGING : . . . good morning heartaches . . . JACK . WowBILLIE SINGING : . . . thought we said goodbye last night . . . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sittin on the porch with his rifle acrosshis knees ? Now where is that ? CODY . Yeah , yeah , well it 's back there .. . JACK . Wherever it is  --  ' course I know where it is  --  at that moment-hmmCODY . What are you doing ? I know where it is  --  I say here  --  JACK . Where is it ? CODY . Right here , " settin with his rifle ' cross his knees " .. . JACK . Yah . Now see these big questions ... " yeah , I was there , yeah "  --  I say " Why did he shoot ? " Cody  --  " He did n't stick it out the window , we was all sitting on the porch "  --  the moment you said that I feel the outdoorsof TexasCODY . YahJACK . Huck is playing his Billie Holliday , see , right here , naturally the guy 's pointing to that part of the porch , and that Huck plays Billie Hollidayoutdoors in the middle of Texas is  --  see , " And Bull 's sittin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees " ... as that is playing in TexasCODY . Yeah , yeah , now you 're talking JACK . Sittin there like this , and where " I 'm sittin there , " and that 's the way it  --  see , then " C-R-O-W-S-H ! " CODY . Yah that was crazyJACK . " A dead tree strunk , he thought , see , for kicks , he 'd shoot the treetrunksee ? " ( reading on to " baby cries " ) CODY. ( laughing ) See , " it hit the treetrunk awright " . JACK . See , " Billie Holliday  --  " CODY . Oh . Yeah man . . . . Now here 's somethin you wo n't believe . Now here 's somethin  --  I 'm gon na tell you somethin you really wo n't believe , now I 'm gon na lay something down to you and you 've got to really think about it in the same sense like we talked about " I ca n't get it down " or somethin , see ? But not about that subject , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . Just as I can talk there for twenty minutesabout the reaction that made me give the demure downward look or the feeling of the " I ca n't get it down " you understand , in the same sense of those phrases you must understand that at the moment that I said these words " sitting on the porch " I chose those and thought of those because I had the same reaction of the outdoors of feeling like the outdoors , that was the very word  --  in fact it was the very reason that I began to speak . . . because you said  --  you know often , I do n't even answer . . . ( blurred tape , talking about Jack saying Bull Hubbard shot " out the(137)window " ) ... and then I said " Yeah , I was there " and I just lifted my mind up and said that  --  I had to say that for another reason , which I do n't want to tell you , man  --  what I 'm sayin , is the reason I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason which  --  what I 'M sayin , what it really was , was , with the tape record , you know , well I said " Yeah I was there , " ordinarily ( Jack laughs ) I would n't have picked up on that and talked about it see , you know , but the fact that we are recording . . . so it was a kind of a lifting yourself up to say " Yah I was there . " Now then , ah , on about two three seconds later and when you said they were inside the window immediately my mind visualized that window as impossible , you know , it was , window , he could n't have shot out a window unless he was trying to sniper , you know , it was like this , the windows were all  --  you know what I 'm sayin , and , so , but . . . sitting on the porch so , because we were always sittin on the porch and the porch where we were sitting it 's all an open front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said " sitting on the porch " I thought that would show that it was outdoors . . . just like you say . . . and then , ah , but instead , my mind then got hungup on the fact that he could n't shoot through the . . . porch .. . because it was screened in , so Bull actually was sitting on the front steps is where he was sitting ! Because the whole thing was screened except the door , yeah , and he 's sittin down there on the front steps  --  but it seems to me he was in a chair .. . JACK . Where 's this thing play , inside the screen ? CODY . Off in the corner  --  yeah inside the screen , yeah JACK . On the porch or in the house ? CODY . Yeah and I 'm sittin , on a bench  --  I 'm sitting on a Somerset Ttypebench all by myself , and Huck 's  --  JACK . Yeah . Where were the washtubs ? CODY . The washtubs were on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's over there in the washtubs . And Huck 's kneelin down and sittin on a small chair by the phonograph record to keep the music goin all the time JACK . What 's he sayin ? CODY . Yeah . Nothin . He 's just sittin there ( laughing ) , he was there blastin , that 's all . . . he 'll pass it to me and I 'll pass it to him , and we 're just sittin there like that , we were n't talking about nothing ever hardly ... but I mean he was , once in a while he 'd talk , you know , when we were alone driving together we 'd talk , just about like we are now see . But Huck at that time was very worried and hungup kind of guy , you know , he was living under a lot of pressure , he really was , see , you understand , and , but he and I dug each other all the time real fine , everything real smooth . But(138) p JACK . What would Irwin be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only there three days , I never told you the great  --  . toryof the bed , about  --  you must have heard about it though , the bed , the symbolic bed ? that Irwin and I were gon na build man ? I did n't tell you about that story ? man I got to tell you about that story . You mean you  --  we 've only played this once ? ( at phonograph ) JACK . No , you played it twiceCODY . " You played it twice " ( repeating ) JACK . YeahCODY . TwiceJACK . Yeah . Well . Play a little  --  little blue eyes there  --  dem there eyesCODY . This is n't blue eyes JACK . Dem dere eyes ( swiftly ) ( MUSIC STARTS ) CODY . Hee hee hee . And the needle . This is the way it was in Texas , the needle 's ruined , see , and this kinda music , and of course Bull would say " Play some Viennese waltzes " and Huck 'd have to play ' em , Bull was deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CODY . Yes ! ' cause Huck 'd say " Aw man , you do n't wanta hear Viennese waltzes , " and he 'd say , " Oh , I really do "  --  and he was n't just making an issue one afternoon . . . . But Huck told me a long time before that had begun , and Huck said " Naturally I thought the guy was just kiddin , " but he really meant it , and he asked it , so every afternoon he 'd play Viennese waltzes for Bull , see JACK . Of course Bull insistedCODY . And here  --  I do n't know  --  and here , with an awful needle like this and a poor machine but very loud , the music was coming out b-r-r-r , scratchy , and it was Viennese waltzes comin out real awful , you know like a tinny phonograph , and here in this  --  and it was sunlight , and hot man , out in the  --  this outdoors , just like we was saying man , it was  --  you understand , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and take a piss or something and I could just hear a little bit of this noise you know , comin off this porch , see , way down in this Texas place ( all laughing ) , real crazy . . . ' Cause it was so hot all the time , it really was n't ... outdoors or anything  --  but what I 'm tryin to say is that Irwin got . . . after  --  now the understanding that Irwin and I had was not any  --  coming back to understanding about anything , but we were just  --  we 'd been high together all of three days , see we 'd been together and we both were still young enough that we would talk and talk and talk every **28;14458;TOOLONG THE CHINESE AGENDA " Sergeant Rodek was the Soviet Army cross-country champio0 two years ago , " Dmietriev answered solemnly . " He is an excellent skier . " " All right . " Jones nodded . " If both of you go , you can spell oM another and get some rest . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved you a long climb back . " Leycock shrugged . " It 's not so far and with the snowshoes , wl should make pretty good time . " " Do n't forget to drag your tracks , " Stowe said suddenly , a without another word turned and walked over to his tent . Jon watched him for a moment , started , as if to say something , but thought better of it . Only Gillon noticed the slight head shaltt# that Jones gave before he too stood up . A few minutes later , Leycock and Rodek had marked th maps to show the location of the rendezvous in case they beca separated from the main party , shouldered their packs and appeared into the trees . Dmietriev , Jones and Gillon watched th go , then separated to set up their own tents . Chapter gCillon finished rigging his one-man tent and crawled inside toa range the sleeping bag , admitting to himself as he did so that heally did not envy Leycock and Rodek the long hike back to themmit of the pass ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quickly . Sitting on the edge of theg , he tied the tent flaps shut , leaving a small opening for ventilaon , pulled off his boots and slipped them between the nylonolhcct ground cloth and the bag , near the foot , beat the snow fromouter clothes and slipped under the down cover . He wasausted , more so than he would have believed possible after allthe rest he had gained during the previous two days . Aircraftpilots required oxygen at ten thousand feet and for all intentsand purposes , they were sitting still . He downed more aspirinballets , recalling his advice to Jones a few minutes before and theargument that had ensued before he would take them . Over Jones'sobjections , he and Stowe had forced an examination of his head . But , beyond a nasty-looking purple and black bruise that extendedbelow the hairline , there was nothing to be seen . Only X-rayscould show if there had been a bone fracture but he was certain that Jones had suffered a fairly severe concussion at the very least . Between them , they had overriden his objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow Jones theMaximum rest possible . Stowe had volunteered to take the firstwatch , Dmietriev the second and he the last  --  and part of thentry duty was to make sure that Jones stayed inside his sleepingg until they were ready to travel again . Jones had finally conledafter a lengthy argument , but with , Gillon remembered , 106 THE CHINESE AGENDAbarely concealed relief . The three of them had then gathered out of earshot of Jones 's tent to discuss his condition . Stowe began , not callously , but with a hardheaded appraisal of their predicament . " If I had to guess , " he said softly , " I would say that his skull is fractured . It 's obvious that he is concussed from the way he moves . The way he dragged us up that damned pass should have killed him . " " Should have , " Gillon agreed , " but did n't . As far as I know , there is nothing that you can do for a concussion except bed rest . And he sure as hell is not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us could stay behind with him , " Dmietriev suggested hesitantly . " The plan calls for us to go back out over this same pass . " Stowe swore loudly and added , " Nonsense ! With the search parties the Chinese will throw into this area as soon as they spot the wreckage , you ca n't believe we 're going to be able to come back out this way ? Hell , there 's not a chance , " he answered his own question . " We have to go deeper into the back country and hope to hell that a pickup aircraft can find us . There is n't a chance that we can come back this way , " he repeated for emphasis . Gillon knelt down and spread out his map and began to study it closely . There was twenty miles yet to the rendezvous . Most of it seemed to be downslope and he guessed that it would be either snowshoe or ski work , although he did not relish the idea of skiing unknown territory by moonlight . But Stowe was probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and return through the pass to the drop point on the plateau , where an aircraft had been scheduled to return in three days to pick them up . He shook his head and looked up at Dmietriev . " Stowe is right . We have to go on farther into the mountains . " Stowe looked smug at that and turned to stare in the direction that Rodek and Leycock had taken . " We should n't have stopped here either . We should have kept on as long as we had the forest for cover . I do n't like waiting here . . . if they come after us , this is a damned bad spot to be trapped . " Gillon snorted . " That 's why Jones sent Rodek and Leycock back up to the top of the pass . " At this challenge from Gillon , Stowe spun around , a sharp rebuke ready , but Gillon stared at him challengingly until he flushedTHE TEEN SHAN 109tude exertion always engendered in him was enough to cause him to wolf the food down . Gillon washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck them away in the pack . At these temperatures about the only thing he did not have to worry about was dysentery from greasy pans . He stuck a few candy bars into his pocket and pulled the sleeping bag outside , turned it inside out to air while he struck the tent and in a few minutes had everything repacked . Jones awoke an hour later and stuck his head out of the tent . Gillon went over to him immediately . " Back inside , " he grinned . Jones grimaced , struggled out and got shakily to his feet . Gillon could not be sure in the fading light , but it looked to him as if Jones was worse . His face did have a definite grayish tinge and his eyes were screwed up with pain . What little he could see of the whites was badly bloodshot . Involuntarily , Jones brought a hand to his forehead , wincing . " Have Rodek and Leycock come back yet ? " His voice was steady enough but Gillon grasped his arm and forced him back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the first-aid kit and handed him the packet of aspirin . " You get two of those down you before we talk about anything else . " Jones started to argue , then changed his mind and accepted the packet . Gillon handed him the canteen and watched him down the pills . As Jones handed the canteen back , he grabbed his hand and forced it open . Two tablets were resting on his palm . " For God 's sake ! You are a baby . Take those damn things before I cram them down your throat . " Gillon broke into laughter and handed the canteen back . Jones grinned sheepishly , took the canteen and washed the tablets down . This time he opened his palm and showed it to Cillon , then opened his mouth and stuck out his tongue . " See , Daddy . . . all gone like a good boy . " Gillon chuckled. 110 THE CHINESE AGENDA " All right , now that you 've played doctor answer my question . Did they come back yet ? " Gillon shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more hours to go . " " Everything else quiet ? " " Yes , " Gillon answered with exaggerated patience . " If not , we would have awakened you and asked what to do . " " Yeah , I guess so . " Jones laughed . " I suppose , too , that I ought to take what rest I can . The next two days are going to be pretty damned rough . " Gillon studied him for a moment , noting that his eyes were so red , they appeared inflamed . " Do you really think that you can make it ? " he asked seriously . " I 'm betting that you 've got a concussion and possibly a fractured skull . " " I do n't doubt the concussion , " Jones said soberly . " My head feels like it 's stuffed to the splitting point . I got a concussion once playing football when I was a kid and my head feels now just the way it did then . " But I 'm certain it 's not a skull fracture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lot of worse if it was . " Gillon shrugged doubtfully . " How about the others ? What do they think ? " " Think about what ? " " Damn it , stop playing games . You know what I mean . " " What makes you think they think anything at all ? " he countered . " Because , " Jones growled , " they would have to be damned stupid not to ! Look , the only thing that I 'm worried about right now is finishing this thing up and getting us all back in one piece . " " If you do n't get back inside that tent and get some more sleep , you wo n't get anybody anywhere . Look , I 'll make a deal . If you take it easy now , I 'll go over the situation with you . " Jones thought for a moment , then nodded and , wincing at the pain , crawled back into the tent . Gillon spread open the flaps and hunched down in the snow . " Stowe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concussion and wo n't be able to make it . " Jones snorted . " Hell , that bastard just wants to run this operation . " THE TIEN SHAN 111Gillon carefully refrained from agreeing and went on to describe e conversation they had held earlier in the day and Stowe 's obrvation that they must head deeper into the mountains and callfor the pickup aircraft to follow them in . Jones nodded soberly and illon knew that he had been thinking along the same lines . He fined with his own conclusion concerning Dmietriev . Jones showed surprise at that . " Dmietriev is supposed to be and-in-command of this idiot 's delight . The Russians tried to Id out for direct command , but the Agency was n't buying . If u 're right , that sure does n't sound like the kind of man they uld send along . " " Well , I do n't know about the politics involved , but from whats shown me , not only does Stowe have him buffaloed , but he uld n't lead his way out of a paper bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillon thought for a moment , then added , " Of course , could be the altitude . . . maybe another day will make the difence . " Jones glanced at him sideways and muttered an obscene exple- . " We 'd better keep an eye on him in case he is cooking upething on his own . Anyway , it does n't make a hell of a lot of difnce , because I do n't have a fractured skull . " Cillon watched as he shifted to a more comfortable position inthedim tent . Any movement obviously caused him a great dealpain , because he moved stiffly , carrying his head in such a wayt as little strain was transmitted as possible . After a moment he ed : " Just out of curiosity , why did you decide to come along ? After Saw you bringing in that beat-up barge I would have bet anydint of money that nothing could have dragged you along . You ked like the orneriest bastard I 'd ever seen . " Cillon chuckled . Around them the trees were blending into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy still- . He could almost feel the temperature plummeting , as he had wn it would . After he had resigned from the service , he had never discussed incident with anyone  --  he still carried the scars on his legs and , supposed without much heroics , on his mind as well . He knew112 Tim CHINESE AGENDAnow that it was not as simple a matter as having something to hate ... Communism versus the American way . To him , it was the idea that certain groups of men were able to direct the activities of other men , were able to gain such power that they could manipulate people as if they were numbers , playing pieces in some cosmic game , completely repressing or ignoring the humanistic considerations , the fears and sufferings , the essence of humanity in short . Perhaps it was that more than anything else that had led him , as a mercenary , always to the ranks of those fighting to overthrow an established government , in some unconscious search for a better way to govern . He really did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the narrow trail in Laos , he had shied away from thinking about it too deeply , and so it had settled immovably into the suspicion that all governments , of any kind , were innately untrustworthy . He owed a debt to Jack Liu , that was beyond question . Liu had asked his help and he was bound to give it . But beyond , he was not really sure himself . Ignoring his own intense dislike of Communism , Jones 's request  --  and Liu 's too , for that matter  --  could also be reduced to the struggle between competing power groups . Gillon was sufficiently a realist to know that such power groups , no matter what they were labeled , had always and would always exist . He had also deduced that allowing the United States and the Soviet Union to obtain the information Liu claimed to have would assist in maintaining a balance of power between three of the five strongest powers on the globe . Whatever else may have beeamong his faults , Metternich had logically foreseen the con sequences of powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still to see that both sides  --  or in this case , the three sides  --  were evenly balanced . Allow one to gain the upper hand , and war was the result . But he did not know if he wanted to tell Jones that or not . Jones would probably believe him , but his job was to make sure the United States got the information first and foremost . Then , if circumstances permitted , the Russians would be brought into the balance pan . Dmietriev certainly must realize this , and if not , then his bosses in Moscow did . If he wanted Jones 's trust  --  and he had a feeling that that trust was going to be of overriding im  --  THE TIEN SHAN 113portance before they were through  --  then he would only tell him about Jack Liu .. . Jones sat on the end of his sleeping bag , watching him , half lost in the darkness inside the tent . Although Jones had promised himself that he would find out why Gillon had changed his mind so quickly that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillon then and there . As he sat in the semi-darkness , watching the play of emotion across his face , he knew that he was going to hear Gillon 's reasons or , he amended to himself , what Gillon thought were Gillon 's reasons . Perhaps he needed to , Gillon was concluding . The psychiatrist that had talked to him in the hospital in Japan had said that someday he would have to and , when Gillon had laughed at him , he had merely grinned back , a grin full of knowing . As he had told Gillon that day , sitting on the end of the hospital bed with the room full of early summer sunshine , one of those rare days in Tokyo when Mount Fuji was not hidden in the smog and dust : " What has happened to you is neither unique nor that disastrous . You spend a few clays going the rounds in here with me and I 'll show you cases where , although they look perfectly sane and healthy on the outside , they 'll never leave a Veterans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just kids , too , most of them not even old enough to drink . But , out there , one wrong word , one negative response in the wrong situation and they 'll either go catatonic or turn into murderous maniacs . You 've got it good , buddy . Your legs will heal , and the scars will disappear in a few years . But you 've got to let it out someday before it tears you apart . Are you a Catholic ? " he asked suddenly . " What ? " Gillon replied , startled . " Are you a Catholic ? " the psychiatrist repeated patiently . " No . . . not since I was a kid anyway . " " Too bad . The confessional is a clever gimmick . . . gives you a chance to bare your soul in relative anonymity . Sometimes you even get lucky and there 's a sympathetic listener on the other side of the curtain . Maybe you ought to try it again . . . it 's good therapy if nothing else . " Gillon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's up to you . But when the occasion arises , let it out . " And so he told Jones what had happened to him on that day , while the arctic wind whipped about them and flapped the sides of the tent . Gillon no longer felt the cold , only the heat and the dust and the pain in his legs as he talked , not sparing any detail , and when he finished , Jones was silent . Gillon stared down at the snow for a while and then stood up and wandered through the trees a few yards in the direction of the pass . He was grateful that Jones had said nothing ; at the same time he was surprised to find that he did not feel relieved of a terrible burden . At i800 , Rodek stumbled into the camp . In the light of Stowe 's flash , his face was whipped and bleeding with the effort of the desperate dash down from the pass and through the forest in the darkness . Gillon helped him to Stowe 's tent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primus going to brew tea . Jones had fallen asleep again but the commotion awakened him and he joined them in the small circle of light pressed out of the darkness by flashlights . Through chattering teeth Rodek spoke to Dmietriev in Russian for a long time . He waved away the tea Stowe brought until he was finished and as he talked , Dmietriev 's face grew longer and longer . There was no hope for Gillon , Stowe and Jones ; they had to wait out the end of the story . When he had finished , Rodek gulped the tea and sank back , exhausted . Dmietriev poured himself a cup of hot water with shaking hands and sipped at it before starting ; then he took a deep breath . " Sergeant Rodek reports that a large force of Chinese ski troops are moving toward the pass . Leycock went down the pass to investigate . From what Sergeant Rodek tells me , Leycock almost ran into them but does not think he was caught or seen . He is sure that they will pick up our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swore viciously . " Damn it , " he finished . " Would n't youknow . All year long they blow . . . except when we need them . " " Rodek came down to warn us , " Dmietriev continued , " and LeyTHETIEN sHAN 115cock stayed behind to keep watch . They estimate that the Chinese will be over the pass by midnight . " " Are you sure it 's not just that damned caravan they saw ? " Stowe muttered . Dmietriev started to retort , took a deep breath and asked Rodek another question instead . " He says , " Dmietriev translated when Rodek had answered , " that these were definitely soldiers and there were no animals with them . They saw the caravan march off to the east . They did not come up the pass . " " Moonrise is at 2330 tonight , " Gillon said thoughtfully , ignoring the exchange between Dmietriev and Stowe . " That means they will pick up our tracks just below the summit . In this pea soup darkness , they probably wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if we are in the area , we 've got to cross the pass . " Dillon stood up and paced around a moment . The others watched in silence until he stopped . " Look , " he said , emphasizing his words with repeated stabs of his gloved hand at the air . " They must just be guessing that we are in here so far . It looks like they searched the wreckage sooner than we expected . Now they know we were n't killed when the plane crashed . That plateau is the only sensible place to land if you come in by parachute , which we had to do since we were n't in the wreckage . " " " But why up the pass . . . ? " Stowe demanded . " The wind must have cleared off our tracks down there . . . " " Yeah , it would have . But once you stand on that plateau , the only way off , unless you are a mountain goat , is up and over the pass . Those ridges are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up the pass , guessing that as soon as it gets light , they 'll spot Our trail . They must be figuring to camp for the night at or just be-low the summit . " " Okay , hot shot , so you got them psyched out . Where do we go from here ? Sometimes . . . " " Shut up , Stowe , " Jones commanded absently . " What have you got in mind , Bob ? " Dillon squatted down and took Stowe 's flashlight and shone it116 THE CHINESE AGENDAdown onto the snow . With his gloved hand , he drew a picture of the pass , approximating the shoehorn shape as seen from above . To the left , he sketched the northward-trending ridge and on the right , the southern ridge . " All right , it 's this . When we started down this morning , I noticed a ledge of snow along the face of the left ridge . It 's been undercut by the wind and thaw and it 's about ready to come down . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in spite of himself . " Between college and the Army , I spent two winters in the ski patrol at Mammoth . We used to go out in the mornings before the skiers hit the slopes and clear out dangerous snow packs . After two winters , I 'm pretty sure I know when a snow ledge is ready to come down . " " " Ah , " Dmietriev breathed . " I see what you are getting at . You mean to blow down that ledge and block the pass . " " Almost right , " Gillon corrected . " I 'm suggesting that we blow the ledge down right on top of that bunch of ski troops . There 's more than enough snow there to do the job effectively . It must be two hundred feet high if it 's an inch , and by the time it gets through dragging all the snow that 's already on the pass along with it , not only will it block the pass until the spring thaw , but it will take those ski troops out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " What a ridiculous pipe dream . Do you seriously think you can get those troops out of the way with an avalanche ? Nonsense . " " I do , " Gillon replied softly . " There is no chance that anyone caught in that pass with all that snow coming down on them will get away . And if they do , so what ? The pass will be closed coin . pletely . " " Yeah , " Stowe shot back . " But if they do , we 're the ones who'vehad it . If you want to take them out , then we set up an ambushat the top . . . and hit hard . That way we 'll make damned certain ! " " And let the Chinese know for sure we are in here , " Jones put inquietly . " Right now , they are guessing where we are . . . at best . Ifwe ambush and shoot them up , we might as well hang out a sign . " " I think you are right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHAN 117an accident ... well , then they may be inclined to treat it as such . . . " " Oh hell , " Stowe snorted , but Jones interrupted him . " I say that Bob is right . Bloodthirsty as it might seem , if we leave those troops alone , they are bound to catch us sooner or later . If we start shooting , some of them may get away and , in any event , to-morrow when the spotter planes are out , if they see bodies all over the slope , the whole country and half the world will know in a mat-ter of hours that we hit them . If they see an avalanche , chances are they wo n't find any bodies until spring . " Jones studied each one of them for a moment before he said , " All right , then we do it Bob 's way . Sorry , Chuck , but the avalanche makes more sense to me . " Stowe started to protest again but , realizing that Jones 's mind was made up , subsided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . " Gillon took a deep breath . " It wo n't take more than two or three small charges to loosen that ledge and drop it straight down the pass . Andre , what explosives do we have ? " Dmietriev got to his feet , went to his tent and returned with several wax-paper-wrapped cubes of plastic material and handed them to Gillon . " They are frozen , but that does not matter . " Gillon took the cubes and laid them on the sleeping bag . " Gelignite ? " he asked . Dmietriev nodded . " A very special type . " Gillon stared at the paper-wrapped cubes . " Hell , the temperature must be near zero . This stuff is too unstable to carry around . " Dmietriev grinned and shook his head . " We do not have to worry about patents , so we changed the formula by reducing the amount of collodion cotton from four to two and a half per cent . This makes the nitroglycerin much more stable and prevents exudation . " Gillon nodded doubtfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use three to be certain and connect them with a fuse . What kind of igniters do you have ? " Andre reached into his parka and pulled out a handful of metal tubes , pointed at one end , with a terminal at the other to attach the118 Tim CHINESE AGENDA " They are very sensitive and can be ignited electrically by screwing the lead into the bulb socket of a flashlight . " " Clever . " " All right then , take what you have to and get going , " Jones ordered . " You should be able to reach the pass well ahead of the Chinese . How about climbing the ridge ? " Gillon thought for a moment , going over the shape of the north-western ridge in his mind . " There is a sharp hogback just above the pass , " he answered slowly . " I think we can get up that way . If not , we can go straight up under the snow ledge . It 's riskier that way , but it can be done . " He paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was no help for it . " I 'm going to need help . Rodek is exhausted and Ley-cock will be too tired to climb . I 'll send him down as soon as we get up there . Stowe , you and Dmietriev will have to come with me . " Dmietriev nodded but Stowe started to shake his head , then changing his mind , shrugged and got up , walked over to his pack , pulled the carbine out of its case and slung it across his shoulders without a word . Gillon nodded approvingly . " That 's a good idea , just in case there is a surprise waiting for us . The moon should be up in a few hours , so we 'll take the skis as well and on the way back , we can ski to the tree line . " He turned to Jones . " If you hear the avalanche go , get Rodek up and be ready to go . " Jones nodded . " All right . If you get back before dawn we should still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gillon walked over to his pack , picked up his carbine and strapped his ski case on . With the snowshoes in one hand , ho walked back over to where Jones stood beside Stowe 's tent . " Look , " he said , keeping his voice pitched low so that the other could not hear . " There 's no need to keep a guard now . You get back into your tent and sleep until Leycock gets back . " Jones shook his head and Gillon gave him a disgusted look . " All right , Doctor , " he relented . " Just be careful up there . Andwatch out for our independent friend . Do n't take any nonsense fromhim . There just is n't room for two super chiefs on this crew . THE ' LIEN SHAN 119 " I do n't intend to . He and I have had one set-to and if it comes to that , we 'll have another . Sooner or later , he 'll learn . " Jones clapped him on the shoulder and watched as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily on the forest by the time the three men moved out for the pass , each using his flashlight carefully to avoid stray flashes of light that might betray them to the aircraft they could hear droning above . The low-branched spruce trees with their short , stiff needles lashed at unwary faces in the misleading light from the torches , and within minutes all three of them had pulled ski goggles and wind masks on for protection . It took them nearly three hours of heavy going in the darkness to break out of the trees . There , Gillon found that the sky had misted over , dimming the stars that ordinarily would have been bright enough to allow them to travel quickly over the open snow . But a high ice layer had moved in to suffuse and dim the starlight enough to mask uneven spots and depressions in the snow , forcing them to a cautious pace . Here in the open they did not dare risk the use of flashlights . By 2200 hours , they were in sight of the top of the pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blot in the blurred sheet of snow . Gillon stopped several hundred feet short of the summit and whistled softly . Receiving no reply , he whistled again . They glanced at one another . Dmietriev nodded and they separated to provide a more widely spaced target as they moved closer to the top of the pass . On the south side , the side from which they were approaching , the last several hundred yards were up a fairly steep incline and in the dim starlight it reared above them like a pale cliff . Gillon whistled again , his imagination pinpointing the spots on his body where Chinese carbines were zeroing in . This time Leycock heard them and whistled back . As they trudged the last few hundred feet to the summit , muscles screamingTHE TIEN SflAN 121with the agony that Gillon had anticipated that morning , he stepped from the concealment of a snow bank and stood waiting for them . As they came level with him , Stowe curled his gloved hand around his flashlight and shone the yellowish beam into Ley-cock 's face . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was exhausted . His face was gray and pinched with the cold and he shivered uncontrollably . Together , they completed the last few paces to the top . Gillon and Stowe went forward a few more feet to examine the sweep of snow below for any sign of movement while Dmietriev questioned Leycock . There was nothing moving below as far as they could tell in the darkness , and they listened carefully as Leycock described his trek down the pass that morning and the long back trail that he had made before he stumbled onto the Chinese ski troops . " Where was that ? " Dmietriev demanded . Leycock slung his carbine . " About six miles below the pass . Rodek and I saw an aircraft , a two-engined transport , circling way off to the north . We guessed that it was about over the southern end of the plateau . It dipped down below the ridge and then we did n't see it again until it flew over that ridge just east of that peak over there . " He pointed into the gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , it looked like it was taking off , but we could n't be sure . So we flipped a coin to see who went down to take a look . I lost . " He chuckled . " So then , I went straight down the pass after the aircraft disappeared and then to the left into the trees along the west end of the glacier . It was a longer route , but I did n't want to stay in the open ... Anyway , about two hours after I started , I cleared a small ridge and spotted a line of troops heading in the direction of the lamasery . I was n't sure about that ; even with the glasses they were too far away . Anyway , I figured that they would n't find anything on either the plateau or at the lamasery and would make for the pass sooner or later . So I cut across that small valley at the north end of the glacier below the plateau and that 's where I almost ran into them . There were about fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell of a hurry . " Gillon dropped the glasses , letting them dangle on his chest . Rub-122 THE CHINESE AGENDAbing his eyes against the bitter cold , he asked , " What was the wind like up here today ? " " The wind ? " Leycock repeated stupidly . He massaged his face and took a deep breath . " Oh . . . yeah , the wind . A good steady blow until about 1500 . Then it died away to nothing . But I doubt if there are any tracks left to find , if that 's what you 're thinking . Anyway , I stayed well west of the trail that we took last night . Unless they are going to cross clear over , they wo n't find tracks , even if the wind left any to find . " " How many did you say ? " Stowe asked . " I 'd guess about fifteen altogether . I did n't stop to count them because they were strung out and I was worried that they might have some point men out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Stowe nod in the darkness . " Then we had better get busy on your damned avalanche , " he murmured , pulling back his parka cuff to peer at his watch . " It 's going to be risky as hell since we do n't know how many are out there . " " Have you seen anything since you got back up here ? " Gillon asked , ignoring Stowe . Leycock nodded . " Just once at sunset . About two miles below the base of the pass . I saw them just after I reached the top and Rodek went down . It looked like they had stopped to eat , because I thought I saw a flashlight . " Gillon stared hard through the glasses once more but the darkness was so intense that they could have been a hundred yards from him and he would n't have seen them . Moonrise was still an hour away and if Leycock was right , he estimated that it would be a close race between the moon and the Chinese troops . At best , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At worst , they would arrive together . Behind him he heard Leycock ask , " What avalanche ? " Stowe described what they had come to do and then in a brusque voice ordered , " You had better get down below to the camp and get what sleep you can . " Gillon opened his mouth to protest , then thought better of it . There was just the faintest hint in Stowe 's voice that he was expecting Gillon to disagree . THE TIEN SHAN 123 " All right , get going then , and be careful , " he said . " That overcast makes it damned hard to see . " Leycock nodded . " If I was n't so tired , I 'd stay here with you . . . " Gillon thought for a moment . . . there was a graceful way out , he thought , one that would n't give Stowe an opening . " Look , it would take you just as long to get back down to the camp if you started now in the dark as it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like it is going to thicken any more than it already has , so why not stay here until then ? You can spread your sleeping bag here and get some sleep . " Leycock agreed heartily . " Great idea . I think I will . I do n't fancy that stretch through the trees in the dark . " Abruptly Stowe turned away without a word and shrugged out of his pack . " Let 's get busy , " he snapped . Gillon smiled to himself and went to work . Fifteen minutes later , they had laid out and carefully fused the three charges of gelignite taken from Dmietriev 's pack . He was worried about the length of wire they would need , but it was much safer and surer than using timed or burning fuses . Together , the three of them circled back down the pass several hundred yards , using their flashlights freely once they had dropped below the top . If there were any search aircraft still out in the overcast , they had had it , but Gillon judged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . They found that the northwestern ridge above the pass presented a long , gentle slope behind that enabled them to climb up almost to the overhanging snow ledge . They were completely shielded from the troops advancing up the far slope by the pass itself and Gillon did not hesitate to use his flashlight to study the final portion of the steep ascent . " Okay , " he said , " let 's go . " Occasionally , Gillon was forced to stopand cut steps into the steeper portions , but the ascent up the final rtion of the eight-hundred-foot-high ridge was completed easily ough by the time the moon 's upper edge began to show fuzzily er the eastern line of peaks . As they trudged forward across the p of the ridge , testing the snow 's firmness with their axes , the cep of moonlight seemed to precede them , changing the dull , THE TEN sn 107and glanced away . Perhaps , Gillon thought , he remembered the incident on the plane or perhaps he had just decided to bide his time for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looked more and more to him that Stowe was pushing hard to take over now that Jones was seemingly incapacitated and Gillon did not know if he liked that idea at all . If anyone , Dmietriev was the more senior and the most likely candidate if , in fact , Jones was really so badly hurt that he could no longer lead . But ever since the landing , Dmietriev had been curiously hesitant , not at all the same strong-willed man he had seemed after taking over the aircraft , and he wondered what had happened to him . Gillon shrugged and stood up . Those were all problems for some other time . Right now , what he wanted more than anything else was some sleep . " Well , we can wait until tonight to see how Jones is . It might not be a fracture after all . The size of that bruise shows that he got hit pretty hard , but that 's all it shows . A blow like that would be enough to shake anybody up . The altitude and exertion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . It may be that all he needs is a few hours ' sleep and he 'll be okay . " " Yeah , maybe , " Stowe answered doubtfully , and turned away . Dmietriev glanced from one to the other and then with a shrug went to his tent . Gillon lay in the sleeping bag staring at the vague sunlight that penetrated the tightly woven nylon , thinking back over the conversation . Jones 's face had had a grayish tinge as he crawled into his tent but Gillon was n't sure whether it had been the light , his imagination or what . Either way , he knew that there was nothing to be gained by rushing Jones into total incapacity . He was the only one with a detailed briefing , and as far as Gillon was concerned , there was a hell of a lot more to what was facing them than he , at least , had been told . He only hoped that nothing had been deliberately concealed from Jones . Outside the tent he could hear the restless crunch of snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gradually , the sleeping bag warmed and he fell asleep . When he awoke to Dmietriev 's call , the tent was deep in gloom and , wondering if he had overslept , he fumbled for his boots and108 THE CHINESE AGENDAchafed and rubbed them back into some semblance of softness , then slipped them down into the bag for a moment to rid them of their chill . The interior of the tent was icy cold and he shivered violently as he struggled out of the encumbering warmth of the sleeping bag and tugged on and laced up his boots . Outside , he found that the sun had slanted so far to the west that it had dropped beyond the distant line of peaks . The cathedral-like atmosphere of the trees had disappeared , leaving behind a deep , all-pervading gloom that seemed half haunted . He slid back a parka sleeve to expose his watch and found that it was close to i600 ; he had been asleep for almost nine hours . Dmietriev came up to him and nodded and they stood for a moment without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lengthening shadows . Finally Dmietriev shivered , said good night and trudged off toward the snow-colored nylon mound of his tent Looking around the tiny clearing , Gillon thought that anyone coing upon them would have to look hard to see the tents ; bleache white as they were . He stared about him once more , then crawled back into his ten and rummaged through the outside pockets on his pack for the Primus stove and the day 's rations . Within minutes , he was sittin on the foot of his bag , crouched under the rain flap of the tent and watching the stove 's almost colorless flame bring the double cup water to a boil . He added the soup mixture , then sprinkled the con-tents of a package labeled beef stew into it . The soup was chicke noodle , or so the label read , but alone , or mixed with the beef stew it would taste terrible . Gillon had yet to encounter a dehydrat food that tasted the way the label promised ; all seemed to chronically undercooked . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water boiled at lower temperatures and wh might taste fine in a sea-level laboratory was only so much ovc spiced , half-cooked mush at high altitudes . He put a second , double-sized cup of water on to boil as soon as the stew mixture had cooked to an edible , but lumpy paste and added a double portion of tea . That at least would make the meal worthwhile . And in spite of the taste , the appetite that high-aid-124 Tim CHINESE AGENDAfrozen surface to a softly glowing opalescence as it drove through the high ice cloud . The snow ledge itself reared above them another two hundred feet and , as they climbed closer , Gillon spotted a jutting ledge of rock barely visible immediately below the base . The entire incredible weight of the snow mass rested its forward surface precariously on this thin rock outcropping . Above the ledge , the snow leaned out and over the five-hundred-foot or more drop to the northern slope of the pass . Gillon could picture the spring sun growing stronger and stronger until it melted away the underpinning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke loose and roared down the pass to block it completely until at least early summer . Below the snow and the rock outcropping , a shelving snow-covered expanse of rock ran below the base of the snow mass from where they stood . Wider at their end , it sloped at a thirty-degree angle for fifty yards and then fell away abruptly to the pass . Gillon had Stowe and Dmietriev stop while they were well back on the ridge and he went forward carefully on snowshoes . He shuffled forward until he dared go no further , then turned to study the underpart of the snow ledge . It reared above him in the moonlight , a harsh white cliff now that the moon had risen high enough to clear the peaks . He could see where the snow rested on the rock and the-wide melt channels that had already been carved by the sun . Two one-pound charges of gelignite equally spaced along the base of the ledge should certainly be enough to break it loose as one mass to bring it down into the pass . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in getting in underneath to the rock ledge without triggering the avalanche . Fortunately , the intense night cold would help to stabilize the mass , although where the melt had run , the snow would be as slick as glass . Nevertheless , he thought , he should be able to reach it by climbing up the slope to the rock ledge . If he placed the charges well back into the snow , the rock ledge would lend added compression to the powerful explosive and muffle the sound until the snow was well on its way . But he did not like the look of the slope below his feet  --  the frozen melt water and the steepness of the runoff . He shrugged . There was nothing for it but to try . He turned carefully by shiftingTHE TIEN SHAN 1255his snowshoes a few inches at a time and trudged back to where Stowe and Dmietriev waited for him . He chose Dmietriev to plant the first charge , the one nearest the ridge on which they stood , basing his decision on the fact that Dmietriev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience than Stowe . He gave Dmietriev careful instructions on how and where to plant the charge and then went to work to lay out his own climbing ropes , showing Stowe how to anchor the line with his ice ax . " Yeah , yeah , " Stowe nodded with a trace of impatience , but Gil-Ion continued remorselessly until he was certain that Stowe under-stood exactly what he wanted . If he slipped , he would go straight over the rock ledge . There would be only the line and Stowe 's strength to save him . Gillon led them both down to the start of the snowfield . He indicated a spot , well back from the start of the ledge , had Stowe anchor his ax , then looped the line around it once and tied a double bowline in the forward end , through which he slipped his legs , and took a turn around his waist , fastening it into a crude belt . He stepped out of the bindings and jammed his snowshoes upright into the snow . Stowe took his position behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward crabwise across the slope on his stomach , spreading his weight over as wide a surface as possible . After a few hundred feet , he risked a quick look behind to where Stowe and Dmietriev stood watching him . A trick of perspective seemed to curve the snowfield so that it appeared as if they were standing on the rim of a shallow bowl . It took Gillon fifteen minutes to cross the thousand or so feet to the rock ledge , using his ice ax to chop hand- and footholds in the icy surface . The snow melt was a greater problem than he expected . It must flood down from the snow during the brief warm period around noon , he thought , creating the damnable glassy smooth surface . Once it caused him to miss a handhold when his glove slipped , but he managed to lash out with the ax , levering his arm from the elbow , to smash the pick end through the crust . He rested for several minutes , waiting for his heartbeat and respiration to return126 THE CHINESE AGENDAto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was at a slower pace , never shifting now until he was doubly sure that at least one foot and hand were both secure . The trip was not as bad as some rock climbs that he had made . The surface being more nearly horizontal relieved some of the tearing weight on his arms and the balls of his feet , but the icy wind that eddied about him , clutching and tearing with frozen , plucking fingers to drive the pain of restricted circulation into his extremities , was more severe than any he remembered . His ax finally struck rock after what seemed like an interminable period of climbing and he paused for a moment before pulling him-self up the last few feet to the rock ledge . Then carefully , an inch at a time , he drew his feet up under him and , using the ice ax as a crutch , stood up . The rock ledge was only a few inches wide and the snow pack curved outward until , seven or eight feet above the ledge , it leaned beyond , forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He was sure that he looked like some old-time movie hero stuck on the ledge of a skyscraper , Harold Lloyd perhaps ; only here , there was no window to duck into ; only the thin nylon line that stretched behind him in a long curve to where Stowe knelt in the snow , keeping it taut . If he slipped or fell , he would slither two hundred feet in a long arc down the glassy snow pack and the jolt when he reached the end would not only break bones but would probably snatch the rope right out of Stowe 's hands . Savagely , he thrust the thought from his mind and concentrated on inching along the ledge until he judged that he had reached the two-thirds point . The narrowness of the ledge posed yet another problem . It had widened for a space but then had narrowed again until he found that he could barely move a foot an inch at a time . He did not dare risk a look at his watch , but the steady climb of the moon above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he had reckoned . Unless he planted the charges , and soon , the soldiers would be over the pass . Abruptly , the rock ledge gave out and his foot tipped over into emptiness and he lost his balance . Gillon scrabbled hard at the icyTHE TIEN SHAN 127surface , arching his back against the front of the snow pack until he could jam his ice ax in to provide a tenuous hold . He rested a moment , gasping in the thin air until he regained his breath and looked around . He was short by several hundred feet of the point where he had planned to lay the first charge . As well as he could reconstruct the face of the snow mass in his mind , he was sure that he was about two thirds of the way across . That was far enough , he decided , and backed up several steps to firmer ground . The narrowness of the ledge and the overhang of the snow pack made it impossible to swing the ice ax with enough force to carve out a hole for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kicked what snow he could away from the base , an inch or so above the ledge , until he had a shallow hole . Carefully , he stooped down , clutching the handle of the ice ax . It would not hold him if he fell , he knew , but just holding onto something gave him a feeling of steadiness . He fumbled the packet of explosive out of his parka with his left hand and pushed it into the hollow , wishing to Cod that he had something that would serve to anchor it . He thought of his knife but its thin , sharp blade would never hold in the snow . He studied the packet , turning it into the moonlight to make sure that the igniter was still in place and that the single wire led out properly from the packet . To make sure it would not be yanked loose from the charge , he wrapped several turns around the packet , then with the spool of wire in one hand , he began to inch back along the ledge , hoping that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing loose . He backed for what seemed like an eternity , moving one foot to his right to feel for the ledge , plant down securely , dig his toes into the soles of his boots and hope . The trek was made worse by the fact that he could not turn his head to see where he was going . When he could no longer see the point where he had laid the first charge , he stopped , took a deep breath and leaning as far out from the wall as he dared , turned his head , scraping his chin across the rough ice . The ledge was a bit wider here , allowing enough room to use the Ice ax . He cut the hole deep , tunneling back as far as he could reach , and scraped the snow carefully out into a pile on the ledge. 128 THE CHINESE AGENDAHe checked the second charge as carefully as he had the first , stooped down and thrust it into the hole , then packed the snow back in until it was filled . Breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how firmly the charge was planted , found it satisfactory and began inching back along the ledge until he could see the snow pack three feet below . He inched backward another few feet until , with the ax resting on the ledge for sup-port , he could ease down onto the snow . He rested there for a moment . Far to his right , Dmietriev was working his way along the snow ledge to where Stowe waited . The explosive on that end of the ledge had been completed , he realized . Taking a deep breath , Gillon eased himself down onto the snow and began the crawl back , using his boots to kick holds . After several minutes , the line began to go slack and Gillon muttered curses at Stowe for his inattention . He stopped , balancing precariously on the steep slope , and gave the line several hard pulls , but it failed to attract Stowe 's attention . Still cursing but with more feeling now , he kept on , but within a few minutes , the line had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dare shout at Stowe to attract his attention . . . the sound could very well carry all the way down the pass and warn the approaching soldiers . He gathered the line into coils and slung it over his shoulder ; hardly a satisfactory solution but better than becoming so entangled that Ile lost his grip . Just as he reached the lower limit of the arc , the hold that he had kicked into the snow a moment before collapsed . He felt himself begin to slide and feverishly he dug in hard with his right hand and stiffened his left foot , but under the sudden weight that hold col-lapsed as well . His hand plowed the thin crust of ice and he began to slide backward at a faster rate . The slack line looped around his shoulder snapped taut and he lost his grip on the ice ax . 1In slid down toward the dark edge of the snow pack , gaining speed with each second . He dropped the spool of wire , wondering idiotically that he had had enough presence of mind not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges loose . Far up the slohe heard Dmietriev 's thin cry and saw Stowe 's shadow racing doTHE TIEN SHAN 129the slope . Good God almighty , he groaned , that bastard had lost the line . His apprehension exploded into fear that verged on the blind edge of panic and he lunged forward with his right arm to retrieve the ice ax , fastened to his wrist by a nylon thong . But encumbered by the coil of rope around his shoulder , he could not reach it . He rolled hard onto his right shoulder and managed to turn over onto his back , from where he could pull his arm down until the ax was in reach of his left hand . In desperation , he grabbed the wooden stock , rolled again and swung the ax high in an overhand arc to bury the blade deep in the snow . The ice crust was extremely thin , almost a glaze this near the edge and the ax ripped through it as if it were so much paper . Gillon managed to kick his boots into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost to the waist but at the same time , slowing him enough to grapple the ax head down under his chest . The chisel blade dug deep into the snow , the pressure of his body forcing it deeper and deeper until just as his feet thrust out over the edge of the snow pack , the ax head brought him to a stop . A moment later , the nylon climbing line snubbed up sharply , then wrenched at his arm painfully . The temptation to lie still a moment with the stiff feeling of the hard snow and the painful jab of the pick side of the ax head pressing Into his chest to remind him that he was still alive was great , but the rope was insistent and he struggled until he could crawl for-ward up the slope . As soon as he was well away from the edge , he waved his hand above his head and the line slacked free . Grunting with pain , Gillon freed the tight coils from his shoulder . As he climbed back up the slope , he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to the near fatal incident turned quickly to anger . He remembered Stowe 's barely concealed impatience as he went through the instructions with thepe , explaining in detail the importance of keeping proper tension on the line at all times . It was Stowe 's carelessness , inexcusable carelessness , that had almost cost him his life . The snow surface grew firmer as he drew away from the edge . Ion got to his feet and , kicking steps with his heels , climbed . fully until he reached the point where the slope flattened. 130 THE CHINESE AGENDAHe stopped here a moment to rest and saw that Stowe was gazing off down the pass as if completely unconcerned by the fact that he had nearly killed him , and suddenly that anger exploded and Gillon rushed across the snow . He vaulted the low ridge that separated the snow pack from the firmer ground of the ridge and dove at Stowe , smashing into him in a flurry of snow . Stowe just had time to turn and see him coming before he went down . Gillon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Stowe 's face . Stowe deflected the punch and struck back , but Gillon followed through with an elbow that caught him on the side of the head , knocking him flat . Then Dmietriev was between them both , pistol in hand . He drove Gillon , still raging , away from Stowe . " Stop it , both of you . " Dmietriev hissed through clenched teeth . " If either of you ever does that again , I 'll kill him . . . kill him . Do you understand ? " Gillon started forward but Dmietriev cocked the pistol . " Stop or I will kill you . . . " he warned , and from his voice Gillon knew that he would and without hesitation . He stepped back , breathing hard , and stared at Stowe . " You almost . . . killed . . . me . " " It was an accident , " Stowe replied coldly . " The line slipped . through my hands when you fell . " " Accident hell . Just plain rotten carelessness and stupidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped . " You will both be silent ! This is neither the time nor the place to debate accident or carelessness . " Gillon knew he was right and , with an immense effort of self-control , choked back his anger . He turned without a word , picked up the rope and handed it to Dmietriev . Stowe climbed to his feet . " If he goes near that line , shoot him . " Gillon jerked a thumb at Stowe . " Where are . . . ? " To get the fuse . " Without another word , Gillon walked down to the ridge and climbed over onto the snow pack . He edged out onto the icyTILE TIEN SIHAN 131part of the pack and , using his ice ax , chopped a series of parallel steps across the shallowest part of the slope . If he was guessing right , the fuse would have unrolled its full length and should be somewhere straight ahead . The moon had risen higher until it was now well clear of the peaks . Its bright light flooded the snowfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was nearly ten minutes before his groping hand brushed the wire . He dug his feet in securely and took a turn in the line around his wrist , leaving plenty of slack so that he would not accidentally pull the charges free . A gentle tug told him that at least the second charge was still secure . With a smooth overhand motion , he began pulling in the loose end of the fuse line . It came freely enough and he coiled it around his hand and elbow until the free end snaked up . Breathing easier , he recrossed the slope . Gillon , Stowe and Dmietriev crouched beneath a rock out-cropping fifty feet above the pass and well away from the path the avalanche would take . The position provided an uninterrupted view down the pass in both directions . On the southern side , he could just make out Leycock 's form through the glasses , as he zigzagged down the slope toward the trees to warn Rodek and ones to be ready to move . On the north slope , the Chinese troopsre visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the pass . towe nudged Dmietriev and pointed . Dmietriev raised his glassesd stared in the direction of the pointing finger , then nodded , uttering to himself in Russian . Stowe and Gillon had maintained a strained silence throughoute past half-hour during which they had circled down the ridge to e top of the pass . They had awakened Leycock , and Gillon d sent him down to warn Jones and Rodek . Then they hadsed the top of the pass and climbed the north ridge to the ge on which they were presently sheltering against the stiff wind t had arisen in the past hour . Try as he might , Gillon had been unable to fathom Stowe . was certain that Stowe realized that his carelessness had almost t him his life , yet his attitude suggested that he was totally132 THE CHINESE AGENDAunconcerned . Gillon debated the problem in his mind as they waited . Was Stowe really lacking in concern , or were his actions deliberate ? If , in fact , he really did not care , then Gillon wanted to be rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he felt right now , he might even volunteer to shoot him . And , if his actions were deliberate , then Stowe was a plant , pure and simple . Yet he could not reconcile that possibility with Stowe 's apparent concern for Jones after the Chinese general had hit him with the pistol . He shrugged and went back to studying the pass . The problem would have to be ironed out with Jones , and soon . The Chinese troops , obviously fresh and used to the high altitude , were making excellent time . Through his glasses , he could make out the tiny dots that were the soldiers against moonlit snow . His plan was to set off the charges after the soldiers had passed the halfway point . There would then be no chance that any of them could reach the bottom and safety on their skis . Any higher and the pass narrowed to such an extent that they might be able to reach the high ridges along the sides . He said as much and Dmietriev grunted acknowledgment ; for once Stowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men looked at one another ; then each , knowing what had to be done , turned away . Dmietriev attached the fuse to the flashlight , working slowly and deliberately , and when he had finished , glanced expectantly at Gillon . Gillon watched the soldiers for a moment , until he knew he must delay no longer . " Ready ? " he asked . " Ready , " Dmietriev repeated . Stowe shifted position , but sa nothing . Gillon nodded and continued to watch through the binocula The troops were spread out in a line approximately seventy f long . They were not roped together but trudged steadily on , hea down and concentrating on their footing . Each man carriedpoles , which he used to aid himself in the climb . Skis strapped their backs appeared as outlandish feathers above their cowl heads . " What are you waiting for ? " Stowe muttered . The lead m was almost even with the rock projection to the right sideTHE TIEN SHAN 133the pass that Gillon had selected as the marker . He took a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some extrasensory feeling , the lead man stopped and raised his head to scan the top of the pass . " Now , " Gillon exhaled , and Dmietriev pressed the button . For an instant nothing happened and Gillon looked at Dmietriev as he calmly pressed the button a second time . Snow erupted in triple fountains above them and three distinct booms rolled down the pass . Gillon pressed his eyes to the glasses again and caught the trapped figures in the circle of moonlight . The lead man was staring wildly around him , pointing at the snow pack that had just begun to shift . As if in slow motion , the troopers began to run , some back down the pass , some toward the nearer , right-hand side . Gillon knew they would never make it . One figure , more clear-headed than the rest , was already fastening skis onto his feet . Gillon swung around in time to see the leading edge of the snow mass dissolve into a vast spray . It hung for an instant in midair , then with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , it began to fall in a long curve of ice until it touched the slope below . There it rebounded high into the air to touch down again further downslope , until within seconds , e whole snow pack was flowing downhill as if it were a giant unami , sweeping all before it . Gillon followed it until the leadingge gathered in the first of the fleeing figures and boiled themder . Only the man on skis , now well ahead of the raging wave , d any chance at all . Gillon watched in an agony of doubt , r , guilt and at the same time , a fierce elation at the thought themight survive , might outrace the deadly mass of snow fillingpass with thunder . The trooper was losing ground but still there was a chance . uictriev was already sighting his carbine , even though it was impossible shot ; then the soldier made the mistake that killedIle should have waited a few seconds more before starting turn to the side of the pass but the thunder of the snow behindt have driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high a speed . His downhill ski pole turned under the impact134 THE CHINESE AGENDAand he went down in a flurry of snow . The avalanche roared over him in an instant , leaving behind only a vast sea of moving snow . A moment later , the avalanche spilled out into the wide entrance as avalanches had done for millions of years and the immense sound died away . Gillon stood up , shaking violently , aware of the sound and its power only now that it was gone . Chapter 1 1 111Sunset of the third day in the Tien Shan . Jones held up his hand and brought the party to a halt just inside a thick stand of trees lining the rim of a well-hidden , narrow canyon . Gillon glanced over his shoulder to see Stowe raise his hand to signal the two Russians and Leycock , who were out of his sight in the trees . Overhead , he could barely hear the distant aircraft . All day the persistent whine of searching aircraft had been with them but the dense spruce and pine forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it possible for them to move by daylight . Consequently , they had made up the time lost at the pass , and the rendezvous , set for dawn on the fourth day , would be kept . Jones swept the canyon and the forest beyond with binoculars and while he was thoroughly engrossed in his examination , Gillon took advantage of the moment to study him . If ever a man had traveled on sheer willpower alone , Jones surely had . Following the long hours of rest , he seemed to have recovered somewhat and for two days now he had pushed them on , resolutely ignoring all appeals to consider his own health . Although they had covered nearly thirty miles through the high mountains on snowshoes and skis in the two days since the avalanche , Jones had become progressively weaker , stumbling several times in the late afternoon . For the last mile of travel , he had leaned heavily on Gillon for support , cursing his own weakness over and over under his breath until Gillon told him to shut up . Gillon shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pack and plodded across the knee-deep snow carrying his own glasses to where Jones stood . The slope , falling away steeply at136 THE CHINESE AGENDAtheir feet , was relatively free of vegetation , but for scattered underbrush thrusting branch tips above the snow blanket . The bottom of the canyon showed a thin depression running through its center . Probably a small stream , Gillon thought , long since frozen and covered over with snow . Aspens lined either bank in thick stands and straggled up the eastern slope to blend with the spruce and fir that reached to the rim . The aspens were so dense that in places it was difficult to see the snow in the fading light through their bare branches . Gillon traced the stream 's course upstream to where it curved sharply and disappeared around a bend . Somewhere beyond that point , he knew , was the rendezvous . Jones had confided to him last night that they were to march along the stream bed for three miles , then wait for Jack Liu in a stand of trees , a stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hardwood , the only one of its kind along the stream bed . " Let 's get a camp set up , " Jones said abruptly , as if to cut off the discussion of his health that he knew Gillon and Stowe , trudging up behind , were about to begin . He turned away and shuffled back to the clearing , where Leycock and Dmietriev were just coming in . Gillon and Stowe stared after him for a moment , then both shook their heads and followed . A quick , hot supper , cooked over Primus stoves , was eaten in silence . Without allowing any argument Jones set the watches , took the first one himself and built a small fire for warmth . They all knew that it was useless to argue with him by now and within minutes , all had turned in while Jones began to pace slowly through the camp . Gillon awoke an hour later . He lay still , his fingers curling around the butt of his pistol beneath the rolled-up parka that served as a pillow , wondering what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The whisper was repeated again , this time with a ferocity that surprised him . In his half-awake , half-asleep condition , it was several seconds before he realized that Jones was outside the tent . " Jones . . . ? " he whispered back . THE 11rN SHAN 137 " Yeah . . . get dressed and out here , quick ! Bring your snow-shoes . " Gillon needed no more urging than that and a few moments later , he pushed open the tent flap and wriggled out . He glanced at his watch , illuminated by the feeble light of the fire ; z000 hours , he shook his head . What the hell was Jones up to ? he wondered . Gillon slipped around the side of the tent , taking care to be certain that Dmietriev did not see him . Jones saw him coming and motioned to him to be quiet and follow . Once away from the firelight , it was pitch black . Gillon banged into a tree and , cursing under his breath felt his way along , wondering what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hand grasped his wrist and a tiny circle of light showed at his feet . " Get your snowshoes on , " Jones whispered . He knelt and snapped on the snowshoes , completely puzzled now by Jones 's actions . Jones grabbed his wrist again and for the next half-hour , they moved quickly through the forest , the narrowed beam of the flashlight leading the way until finally , Jones edged into a small clearing and stopped . " We should be safe enough here , " he said quietly , and dropped down onto a fallen log . The fast pace Jones had set through the trees coupled with the grogginess of insufficient sleep had left Gillon irritable and exhausted . Nevertheless , he sat down , laid the carbine across his lap and unfastened the snowshoes so that he could sit comfortably . " What 's all this nonsense . . . ? " he started . But Jones held up a hand . " Wait now . . . give me a chance to catch my breath . " He flicked off the flashlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in silence while the thin noises of the forest gradually became audible around them . Distant cracks as live wood contracted in the cold ; a faint stirring of wind among the snow-laden branches and occasionally , a soft plop somewhere as a branch dropped its burden of snow . Gillon was impressed with the absence of animal noises . There were no animal sounds at all ; any that could survive nine-thousand-foot altitudes in winter were usually hibernating animals. 138 THE CHINESE AGENDAJones finally broke the silence . " I wanted to get you out here so that I could fill you in on what 's happening , " he began , keeping ' his voice low , barely above a whisper . " I figure that I can trust you more than any of the others . " Startled at the unexpected admission , it took Gillon a moment to recover . " Why ? " he asked flatly . " All right , if you want to know why , I 'll tell you , " Jones answered without hesitation . " Dmietriev I ca n't trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has his own set of orders that supersede any of my instructions if things should get tight . That 's a fact of life , like it or leave it . Same for Rodek , and besides , if he speaks English , he is n't letting on . Stowe , never ! Stowe is a born troublemaker and if we ever get out of this thing , I 'm going to fix it so that he never leaves a desk again . Dmietriev told me about the trouble you two had up in the pass . Stowe has been around long enough to know better . " " Seems like we have two troublemakers then . . . " Gillon interrupted . " If you mean Dmietriev , forget it . He told me because he 's worried about his neck , naturally . You were in charge , Stowe should have obeyed without question . I do n't know if he lost that rope accidentally or not , but when we get out of this , I 'm going to find out . " Both of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a moment . " Leycock would normally be my second choice . His record is damned good . " " If it 's that good , then why me ? " " Because without you this mission does n't stand a prayer . If you are n't along , Liu does n't hand anything over but trouble . And if you think there is a chance of shooting it out with them , forget it . We would n't stand a chance . " " Glad to see you recognize that . Liu is one of the most careful men I 've ever met . " " So I picked you for that reason and for one other . . . " Jonespaused a moment , as if trying to decide whether or not to continue . " I do n't mind telling you , " he said after a moment , " that thisTHE TIEN SHAN 139damned head of mine is about to split . Look , let 's get this over with in a hurry . There 's something else we need to talk about and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gillon heard a rustle of papers and Jones turned the flashlight on again , shielding the bulb with his gloved hand so that only a glimmer of light showed on the map . Using his finger , Jones traced the long route they had followed from the plateau on which they had landed , up and over the pass and down through the forest to their present camp . " There is a chance that Liu and his people wo n't make the rendezvousi tomorrow . If they do n't , we have an alternate setup , here , fifteen miles southest . " Jones drew a wavering line across the steep ridge on the far side of the canyon , then over several more lower ridges northwest to where it met a small valley less than twenty miles from the plateau . " We make a circle . . . the idea is that from the alternate site , we can go back to the plateau , where the Russians can get an aircraft in to pick us up . Otherwise , if Liu and his people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information he has , we march due east for eight miles "  --  he indicated the route on the map  --  " to this area in the foothills of the Khalik Tau , above the Yakanash River . " That radio contact with Ala Kul last night indicated that the Russians expect to have no trouble in getting a plane in at Khalik Tau or onto the plateau . So if Liu is n't waiting for us tomorrow , we radio Ala Kul and make tracks for the alternate point . " " And if Liu is n't at either one ? " " Then the Chinese have got him , " Jones said with finality , " and we get out as fast as we can . . . to either one of the landing sites . If we find we ca n't reach either one , then we are on our own and we run for the border as best we can . " Jones paused . " There is one other thing you ought to know about as well . The information that Liu has for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and instrumentation data on the nuclear warhead test series . " " Well , how about that ? " Gillon 's tone was sarcastic but Jones140 THE CHINESE AGENDAignored him . He was not in the least surprised . Since the trouble at Ala Kul , he had begun to suspect there was more to their mission than he had been told . " The data actually contain the locations and targets of the nuclear missile hard launching sites which the Chinese have set up in the past year along the Mongolian border . " Gillon whistled . " Do the Russians know ? " " Let 's say they have n't exactly been told that much , but I 'd be damned surprised if they did n't know . Incidental to the targeting information is the nuclear test data that the United States wants . It 's in our interest to see a power balance maintained between China and Russia ... one of the basic reasons behind the Sino-American talks , although neither side will ever admit to it . We want the locations of these missile sites in Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , " Jones stated rather than asked . " If one side gains a preponderance of power over the other , then they will always be tempted to capitalize .. . if you 'll pardon the pun . . . on it , which in this case could mean pre-emptive strikes resulting in all-out nuclear war . Nuclear war in Central Asia could be just as destructive to civilization as a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union . " " So now we 're saviors of mankind , " Gillon answered sardonically . " Look , I agree with you , it would be downright dangerous to let China and Russia sling H-bombs at each other . But except for raising the radiation levels a bit , they are n't going to really hurt anyone but themselves . . . unless one of the other nuclear powers is stupid enough to take a hand . " " Or either China or Russia figures they are about to and decides to hit first . " " Yeah , " Gillon replied after a moment , " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position on the log , suddenly troubled by what Jones had said . All of a sudden his carefully cultivated and very comfortable cynicism had been cut to pieces . He had n't thought that far along about the consequences of a nuclear war between Russia and China . " You started to say that there was another reason you picked me ? " Jones played with the flashlight a moment as if gathering hisTHE TIEN SHAN 141thoughts , then laid it on the log to illuminate the map . " Yeah , there is . As far as we know , the Red Chinese have no active interest and no agents involved in that two-bit war you left a few days ago . The decision to contact you was made minutes after Liu 's message naming you as the contact . I was at Orly in Paris waiting for a flight to Moscow when the call came through to go and get you and six hours later Phan and I were waiting on that dock for you to come in . Except for an hour or so in the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't been out of my sight since . " " Meaning ? " Gillon was puzzled . " Meaning , I think you are the safest . . . " A branch snapped close by and Jones grabbed for the flashlight . A single shot cracked out of the dark forest and the flashlight went spinning into the snow . He had just enough time to see Jones lean forward as if completely exhausted and fall forward into the snow before he instinctively threw himself backward off the log into the under-brush . A moment later , a spray of bullets swept the clearing . He crawled madly into the trees for several feet , jumped to his feet and took four long steps to his right and stopped . He pressed hard against a tree trunk and let the night surround him , straining above the sound of his own convulsive breathing to hear the soft swish of branches or the sharper crunch of snow . After a moment , his mind began to work again . He judged that he was less than twenty yards from where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left of the point from where the shots had been fired . Jones had been the first target and that had saved his own life and whether it was because Jones was the leader of the expedition or had been holding the flashlight , Gillon did not know . He had been scared before , scared many times , but never this badly . He had to fight to hang onto his sanity , fight to prevent himself from being overwhelmed by panic and racing away into the forest as every muscle , every nerve in his body was urging him to do . And he could n't stay here ; already there were sounds of brittle tree branches snapping as if someone were moving closer to him . If he stayed where he was , they would find him sooner or later . if he tried to run for it , he knew damned well that without142 THE CHINESE AGENDAhis snowshoes , which were still stuck in the snow beside the log , he would only flounder helplessly in the deep snow until run down . And besides , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which direction to run . Gillon ground his teeth together in an effort to control his ragged breathing and forced himself to think . What had Jones been carrying ? A rifle , maps ? Probably nothing more . The maps were not worth going back for . . . he could remember the place names and his own map was a duplicate and there had been nothing on them to indicate their route of march or the two rendezvous points . Anything else that Jones knew about the mission that Gillon did not , was locked away in his mind  --  a mind that was no longer in existence . Whoever it was , might as well have those maps too , he thought . They seemed to have everything else . Moving cautiously , careful to stay well back into the shadow of the tree , Gillon peeled back his cuff and looked at his watch . About five minutes had passed since the shots were fired . Whoever had shot Jones was either endowed with superhuman patience or else was gone and Gillon really did not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp ? he wondered , and decided not . They were at least two miles away and the trees would have suppressed the sounds over that distance . Also , a new thought occurred to him ; if the killer had been one of the team , he would never have risked the shots within hearing of the camp . The killer would have been too readily identifiable by his absence . His dilemma was compounded by the fact that he had not the slightest idea where he was in relation to the camp . Jones had taken a roundabout way through the forest to confuse anyone following . But it had also thoroughly confounded him . Gillon was not even sure in which direction the camp lay . He could , he knew , find their tracks in short order with his torch , but that would only invite a quick rifle bullet . The soft squeak of snow beneath a boot sole snapped him instantly to full alert ; even his breathing was suspended to a shallow draught . Years of fighting in the jungles of Africa and Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations likeTHE TIEN SHAN 143this and , except for the snow , it was no different now than the many jungle ambushes he had led in the past . He listened with his whole body for the next footfall . Instead he heard a soft voice speaking a high , singsong language . . . Chinese . My God ! he thought . Of all the damned luck . Chinese troops . They must have been in the area and heard them talking or had seen the flashlight . Gillon unslung his carbine , crouched and moved quickly to his right , then as quietly as he possibly could , retraced his steps toward the clearing . A few moments later , he gently pushed aside the underbrush . What he saw chilled him to the bone . Four Chinese ski troopers were shining flashlights down onto Jones 's body while a fifth man , an officer , examined a blood-streaked map . As he watched , a sixth soldier pushed out of the trees and joined them . He said something and pointed to Jones 's body . They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hood , had skis strapped to his back and was wearing snowshoes . Each carried an AK-47 carbine and one man wore a radio . As Gillon watched , the officer spoke to the man with the radio and he took the handset and pressed a button . Without seeming to hurry in the least , Gillon edged his carbine through the branches and shot the man with the radio through the chest before he could speak the first words . The others looked up , startled at the sound of the carbine , and Gillon sprayed the area with the carbine set on full automatic . Two other soldiers went down under the onslaught and a third , turning to run into the trees , stumbled as one leg buckled under him . The officer sprinted for the trees and disappeared . The sixth man had flopped down into the snow and Gillon saw him snatch at something inside his jacket . Guessing what it was , he threw himself headlong out of the thicket and rolled beneath the protection of a fallen , snow-covered tree . Something crashed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundly with the concussion as several pieces of shrapnel thudded into the wood . Gillon thrust himself away from the protection of the tree and scrambled to the edge of the clearing . One of the flashlights had fallen into the snow , 40 THE CHINESE AGENDAwas meant as a joke or an insult . Stowe 's manner provided no clue and he decided that , this early in the game , the benefit of the doubt was in order . He nodded . " Yeah , I do . I understand that both of you know your way around in the mountains . " " He noticed that Leycock had stopped work and was watching Stowe . " You do , huh ? " Stowe grinned . " My kid brother does a lot of hiking in the Cascades . But I sure as hell do n't count that as knowing how to use this equipment . " And now he knew . Gillon stepped quickly across the aisle . " Look , friend . We 're going to be together for quite some time . We need to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart talk and I 'll tear your head off . " Gillon 's move was so quick and unexpected that Stowe stepped back involuntarily . Leycock sat back on his heels and laughed . " Chuck , I do think that you 've met someone who 's not going to take any nonsense . I 'd leave him alone , if I were you . " Stowe considered Gillon for a minute , as if deciding which tack to take . Gillon waited patiently , watching his face for any sign of a quick move . Finally , Stowe grinned . " All right . I apologize . If you say you know , then you know . " " Darned right , Stowe , " Jones said quietly . " Gillon cut his teeth on the Swiss Alps when he was a kid . Not only that , but he took the cross-country silver medal in the 1964 Winter Olympics . " Stowe shrugged . " All right , then I apologize . I 've had to work so long with stumblebums like these that I 've come to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't run with anyone , " Gillon said flatly . " Yeah . . . I can see now that you do n't . Anyway , I do apologize . " Stowe stuck out a large hand . " It is certainly nice to have an expert who is an expert along for a change . " With some misgivings Gillon shook hands . Stowe was a large , rangy individual , and the strength of his grip was certainly no childish attempt to impress him . He would be a mean customer in a fight , he decided , and it was better to have him on the same side . Both Jones and Leycock were grinning openly . In the closedTHE SOVIET UNION 41Intelligence community , reputations counted for all . No matter what a man 's abilities , good , bad or indifferent , it was his reputation , which often had no bearing on his demonstrated abilities , that counted . Gillon nodded and smiled thinly at Stowe . Stowe seemed to take that as an acceptance of his off-hand apology and Gillon , ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment that had been laid out on the deck . Because he was expecting It  --  a test of a sort  --  he sensed rather than saw Stowe 's leg coming at him as Stowe threw himself almost horizontal with the effort he put behind the side thrust kick to Gillon 's thigh . Stowe was to his right , so Gillon shuffled forward with his right foot to take himself out of the line of the kick . So fast was his movement that Stowe was caught by surprise and , in trying to correct his aim , lost his balance for an instant . That was all Gillon needed and his right hand smashed into a downward block that knocked Stowe 's extended leg away . Spun off balance , his left foot acting as a pivot , Stowe stumbled and Gillon stepped forward , snapped his right foot out and caught Stowe behind his left knee and sent him crashing to the deck . Instantly , Gillon was on him , his own knee crushing down on Stowe 's exposed thigh . One hand pressed his left arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin-bladed throwing knife to the inside of Stowe 's ear . " The next time you try that , " he said softly , pressing down on the point until it drew blood , " I 'll carve your brain out . Do you understand ? " Stowe grunted an acknowledgment and Gillon stood up quickly and backed away , dipping the knife back into his boot . The incident had happened so quickly that Leycock and Jones were immobilized by surprise . Stowe climbed slowly to his feet , staring at the blood on his fingers where he had pressed them to his ear . " By God , you cut me . . . " he said , astonished . Jones whistled slowly . " He sure as hell did ! " " You , buddy boy , are damned lucky to be alive , " Leycock murmured . " I sure am glad I did n't try that . " Stowe stared at Gillon , his face ugly , then back at the blood on42 THE CHINESE AGENDAhis fingers and snarled , " Next time , friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any kind . " And Gillon knew that he would n't either , but at the moment , he did not care . He was still shaking inwardly . If he had not been expecting the kick , the incident could have become very nasty . After a moment more , Stowe turned away , intense anger evident on his face , and went aft to the lavatory . Leycock and Jones wandered forward to the galley , just aft of the cockpit , and Gillon , left alone for the moment , returned to an examination of the equipment laid out on the deck . He was breathing heavily and the adrenaline shock was beginning to drain away . He noticed that his hands were shaking slightly and he was glad the others were gone so they would not notice . Forcing himself to relax he first checked over the mountaineering gear , tents and sleeping bags . The first were excellent quality Swiss mountain tents of very lightweight , close-woven parachute nylon . Each would accommodate one man and his gear . A single T-brace of aluminum tubing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have weighed more than two pounds . The sleeping bags were five-pound goose-down mummy bags of the type sup-plied by the U. S. Army to the Ski Corps . Each was capable of keeping a man warm and alive in temperatures to twenty below . Lightweight wool liners added an additional five-degree safety margin . With the sleeping bags and tents , they should be able to survive a blizzard in the Antarctic . Each pack was also supplied with an alcohol compass , tiny Primus stove , sufficient dehydrated food in individually wrapped meals for five days , two changes of nylon mesh underwear , socks and gloves , and a personal pack containing first-aid supplies , toilet articles and liquid soap with a label stating that it would not harden in below-freezing temperatures . Gillon snorted at that . Satisfied that the packs had been made up by experts in mountain survival and that everything that he would have chosen was included , he turned his attention to the outer clothing and the weapons . Each of them was supplied with a one-piece white coverall designed to be worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43fitted with a hood that could be drawn tightly around the face by means of a cord . Gloves , lightweight silk affairs without padding , were supplied and at the cuff of each coverall , thickly padded mittens with trigger slits were attached with plastic zippers that allowed them to be removed if required . Lined face masks were contained in roomy pockets inside the jackets . The boots , vacuum-Insulated , were one piece with each suit and over these , ski boots could be drawn . The entire suit was made of the same closely woven nylon as the tents and lined with a two-inch layer of goose down , the best insulator so far discovered for cold-weather use . Each pack was mounted on a sturdy Himalaya frame , constructed of duraluminium , and bore stickers showing that they had been purchased from Frost-line Equipment in Seattle ... no better supplier of mountain gear in the world . Gillon had been accustomed to the M-16 carbine for several years , considering it one of the best all-around weapons for counter-insurgency warfare yet developed . But when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , he knew that he might have to change his mind . He had heard about the AR-i8 but had never seen one before . A slightly smaller version of the M-i6 , it was a substantially lighter and , at first glance , simpler weapon . It used the same .222 caliber ammunition and if it weighed five pounds when fully loaded , Gillon would have been surprised . He stripped it down and found that it came apart much like the M-i6 , but went back together again much more easily. lie sat back on his heels and surveyed the neat piles of equipment before him . At least from the standpoint of supplies , he decided , this idiot-mission had been well organized . He looked up warily as Stowe came back into the cabin . A wad of tissue stuck out of his left ear and his face was not exactly what Gillon would have described as friendly . Stowe hesitated a moment as if undecided and then shrugged . " Oh hell . " He grinned at Gillon . " I guess I had that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jones , kept quiet about you that he was setting me up . The Agency boys do n't think much of me or my outfit because we do n't do things by the book . " 44 THE CHINESE AGENDASo that was it , Gillon thought to himself . A setup to teach Stowe who was boss and at the same time to find out if he was as good as his record indicated . Very neat , very neat indeed . His respect for Jones rose another notch . " Forget it , " he said carefully . " We were both set up . " Stowe nodded and went on forward . Gillon sank down in his seat and stared at the cabin lights reflecting in the window , considering , wondering what other surprises they might have in line for him . They were not unique , he thought , Jones , or whatever his real name was , Leycock and Stowe . He was the unique one , unique in the sense that he was part of a dying breed  --  the professional soldier . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really was not such a bad life . Most of your decisions were made for you and your responsibility was only to carry them out  --  within narrow limitations . But either the world had grown too small and the weapons too terrible or else civilization was at long last passing from intemperate adolescence to maturity . It seemed to him that warfare had been taking on two or three new aspects since the end of World War II , new aspects that were rapidly consigning overt warfare to extinction . The so-called Wars of National Liberation  --  Malaya , the Philippines , Korea , etc.  --  had pretty much died out in the mid-i96o 's , as the Communists changed their tack from indirect or direct aggression to internal subversive movements such as had taken place in Indochina . That one had been a mistake all the way around , resulting from considerable misunderstanding on the part of North Vietnam and the United States as to the intentions and commitments of the other and so it had blown up into a full-scale land war . It would be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The little wars , Gambia , Bolivia , Nigeria/Biafra , Colombia , etc. , were really internal affairs , civil wars of a kind , but complicated by big-power interference . But even these were dying out as the emerging nations gained maturity and learned to handle their problems in other , less deadly ways . Africa could never be compared to the two-hundred-year reign of terror that had wracked Central Europe  --  and in particular the Balkans . All considered , THE SOVIET UNION 45Africa , with little in the way of human resources , had moved quite peacefully from direct imperialistic control to a series of independent nations in less than twenty years . The few wars that had broken out , with only one or two exceptions , had been confined to within national borders rather than to aggressive attacks on other nations . Warfare had become a push-button affair  --  as had long been expected  --  in which highly trained technicians monitored surveil-lance consoles , fingers poised over triple-locked buttons that could unleash forces capable of destroying civilization . Except for skirmishes here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was fast disappearing . But disappearing by becoming sub-merged in the third aspect , the silent wars . The wars of international surveillance or espionage involved the same old power blocs , but considerably fewer people and with much less dangerous effect . And Jones , Leycock and Stowe represented the new soldier . To him their work was a game , a silly , almost useless game involving gg per cent newspaper clipping and only a per cent direct action . But to them , it was a deadly life-or-death struggle , as overt war was to the professional soldier . Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal , the new driving out the old . And that 's what he was , the old species watching himself give way to a younger , more clever breed . He would hold his own while the new breed slowly gained ascendancy , but slowly , surely , his would die out . Chapter 6Sometime after dawn , Gillon woke again to find that he felt rested for the first time in months . He stretched , then wandered forward to find some coffee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats and in the cockpit , Gillon found the radio operator stretched out on a small fold-down bunk . The pilot was dozing at the controls and the co-pilot staring moodily through the cockpit windscreen . The sun was just clearing the horizon and the land below them was in darkness . From one horizon to the other , Gillon noted with interest , the skies were perfectly free of cloud . During the long night , they had obviously outflown the storm cell . Gillon drew two cups of coffee in the galley and handed one to the co-pilot . In silence , they watched the sun inch higher and higher until with a sudden burst of radiance , a flood of golden light sped swiftly toward them as they raced to meet the sun . The co-pilot polished a pair of sunglasses on his shirt and put them on . Gillon contented himself with shielding his eyes against the glare for the moment . Within minutes , the countryside was flooded in the clear , soft light of dawn , revealing a carpet of gold-polished white wool . Gillon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kit . Twenty minutes in the tiny shower facility on the aircraft and he literally felt like a new man . Sometime later , Gillon finished the large breakfast put together by Jones and Leycock and was enjoying the first cigarette of the day . He had just spread a copy of the map describing their route into the Tien Shan on his lap when a flicker of light caught his attention . He turned to the window in time to see the sleek shape of a Mig 21 sliding into place off their port wing . Its pilot glancedTHE SOVIET UNION 47r at the Jetstar and waved . Gillon felt the Jetstar rock abruptly their pilot waggled his wings in answer . Through a window ss the aisle , he could just see a second Mig arriving to leadin . " Company , " he announced , and pointed toward the Mig on the hoard side . The other three hurried to the windows . " Sure is , " Leycock muttered . " I hope to hell they 're expecting us. " " if they were n't , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stowe muttered . " Christ almighty , " Leycock exploded , " does n't anything ever II ) your disposition ? " Juries gave Stowe a disgusted look , shook his head and wan-red back to his breakfast , leaving Stowe staring after Leycock Itl- a faint grin on his face . Ahead of them , Gillon spotted a peculiarly flat , somewhat bowl-aped area and a quick map check showed it to be Ala Kul. ornents later , the Jetstar bore around to the north , the Migs folingsmoothly , and a small airfield on the southern edge of the e slid into view . As the turn was completed , the Migs Etc- ! crated ahead to lead them in . Junes walked back from the galley , leaning heavily against the ntrifugal pull of the aircraft as the pilot completed the turn , and pped into the seat beside Gillon . He pointed to a line of distantntains and there was an undercurrent of anticipation and citement in his voice . " Those are the Tien Shan ! The Chinese border is just about in e with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy miles , the Tien Shan Aced bleak and forbidding , Gillon thought . And damned danrous as well . Snow lay thick down to the foothills and in the gher elevations deep winter raged . And , he thought , most oftheir time would be spent at elevations above nine thousand feet . Interminably , the mountains stretched from horizon to horizon , northeast to southwest . In the early morning light , they were artcel-blue barrier , the jagged peaks wreathed with heavy clouds . The sight of these almost unknown mountains  --  although unknownnly to the West , inhabited as they had been for thousands of48 THE CHINESE AGENDAyears by Siberian , Mongolian and Chinese tribesmen  --  did nothing to increase Gillon 's enthusiasm . This view of the mountain range from ten thousand feet and a vantage point of seventy miles made it clear why the Soviets had insisted that the mission start from Ala Kul . It would be a straight flight due south to the massive escarpment that marked the be-ginning of the Tien Shan . In some ways , the escarpment reminded him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At midrange , the northeastern wall of the Sierras was a single , three-hundred-mile-long massif rearing above the Owens Valley . The Sierra 's had been caused , he knew by some eons-old series of cataclysms that had literally snapped free the crust of the mantle and tilted it upward like a broken paving block . He wondered if a similar event might not be responsible for the Tien Shan . Gillon turned back to the airfield in time to see the Migs touching down . Moments later , the edge of the runway flashed past beneath and the Jetstar was down and taxiing after the Migs as they made for a hangar on the far side of the field . The airfield had a curiously deserted air about it , in spite of the bustle around an Aeroflot TU-144 airliner loading passengers at a small terminal . Heads turned in curiosity as the Jetstar taxied past and Dillon wondered if the national markings were still in place . They had been when he boarded the plane in Conakry , but they could easily have been changed in Rome without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of an old , worn-out hangar . Staring through the window at the weather-beaten building , Gillon reckoned that it must have been built at least thirty years before , probably before World War II to protect the Russian southern flank as the Japanese had moved westward . Now it merely served as a forward base from which this " safe " area of the Chinese border could be watched . There was , Gillon realized , only the remotest possibility that the Chinese would dream of mounting a land attack through the barrier imposed by the Tien Shan . Border actions might certainly be fought in the high passes and meadows , but hardly anything more serious . Only someone with the courage and stubbornness of a Hannibal would even dream of trying , and technology had long ago replaced elephants with less efficientTIE SOVIET UNION 49means of locomotion . And further , since this territory was never in dispute with the Chinese , there was little likelihood that they would press for border adjustments as they had done further north along the Sinkiang border , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building opposite them some three hundred feet . To judge by the multitude of signs nailed to its front the hangar did double duty as an administrative center . Weather-beaten and paint peeling , it nevertheless did not induce that empty feeling that most such World War II-vintage military buildings all over the world did , whether still in use or not . Jones got up and reached into the rack for his parka . Gillon did the same , and , shrugging it on , he joined the others in the aisle , stretched and waited for the next development . Shortly , the co-pilot stuck his head into the cabin . " Captain says you may as well go on and get out . The control tower does n't speak English and now they wo n't even answer us . Nobody else seems to be around . " A worried frown appeared on Jones 's face for a moment , but he motioned toward the back of the cabin . " Let 's go see what the holdup is all about . " Leycock nodded and with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hatch , unlatched and shoved it open and pushed the button to extend the ramp . The sun had been up for less than two hours , but already the sky was an intense cobalt blue with scattered , blindingly white clouds . The terrain , incredibly flat , stretched unbroken , west to the horizon . To the east , it butted sharply against the distant Tien Shan escarpment . From the level of the airfield , the mountains were completely covered with snow ; the slopes icy gray and blue with long lines of shadow lacing sharp white ridges . The intervening distance was ethereal , mirage-like in quality , so that it seemed no more than a walk of a mile or two to the rearing barrier of snow and ice . Gillon turned to the north ; again a similar vista . Flat steppe covered with snow stretching away to the horizon , the monotony of the terrain somewhat relieved by the demanding line of peaks50 THE CHINESE AGENDAcurving away to the northeast . Gillon was struck by the majesty and serenity of these vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if the others were as affected as he was by the quiet immensity of Central Asia . After a subdued moment , Leycock coughed in the cold air and the spell was broken . " God almighty , " Stowe muttered , stamping his feet . " This place is about as deserted as those mountains . " " Do n't let it fool you , " Jones said tightly . " Neither is . This place is full of Russians and they are probably wondering who the hell we are because some damn fool clerk in Moscow forgot to process the paperwork . And , over there , " he said , pointing toward the mountains , " are more Chinese soldiers than you ever thought existed , all waiting for us to come bumbling across their border . " His words were strangely prophetic and Gillon was to think back on them bitterly in the coming days . Stowe snorted . " You 're probably right ... " " Over there , " Leycock interrupted , pointing across the field . A bright red snowplow , almost black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runway . A crystal plume of blown snow towered thirty feet above the cab , spraying a fine mist of flashing rainbows as it drifted slowly in the bright sunlight . " Hey , you guys , wake up . " The co-pilot was standing above them in the hatch with a pack in either hand . He tossed both down and reached back inside for two duffle bags , which he passed down to Gillon . " What are we supposed to do with these now ? " Stowe yelled up at the co-pilot . " For God 's sake , if you do n't know by now , then you better get back . . . " He stopped abruptly and stared at the hangar . A distant voice shouted in a guttural language that could have been Russian or any one of the many Asian dialects . The four men turned as one toward the hangar . " Who the devil ? " Jones began , and took a few paces forward . The sound of booted feet trotting in rhythm floated around theside of the hangar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian soldiers trotted into sight . There were ten soldiers , TEE SOVIET UNION 51vc abreast and all carrying rifles at port arms while a sergeant tted beside them calling cadence . Gillon and Jones stared at eh other in surprise and both started back to the Jetstar just as o jeeplike vehicles roared up behind , one jamming to a stop in nt of the aircraft 's nosewheel , effectively blocking any moveent , and the other skidding to a halt beside them . A young officer tilted out as the soldiers reached them , rifles leveled . " What in hell is going on here ... P " The officer pushed Jones back and pointed . Instantly , four solerssprang forward to grasp each of them by the arms . Fourore stepped in close , shoving rifle muzzles into their sides . The officer sauntered back and forth a moment as the four Americans stood still , too astonished to say a word . Finally , the officer stopped in front of Jones and looked him up and down . " Amerikanets ? " Jones glanced around at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Amerikanets . . . Amerikanets ... " The officer nodded . " Da , Amerikanets . . . Amerikanets . Shpion . " " Like hell , " Jones shouted , and fumbled though his long-forgotten college Russian . " Nyet , nyet Amerikanets shpion , drug K Rossii . " The Russian officer merely snorted at that and motioned to theIdlers , who closed in tightly and began herding them toward thegar . Gillon managed a glance over his shoulder in time to seec pilot stop , halfway down the ramp , beside the co-pilot , mouthn in surprise . A rifle barrel jammed painfully into Gillon 's back was good as a command in English to face forward and he did so , promptly . The officer , who had jumped back into his jeep to follow , climbed out again as they reached the building and pushed ahead to shove open the door . They were shoved inside and , with gestures , the officer made them understand that they were to sit down along the wall . Stowe jerked his arm away and shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shouted . His guard reversed his carbine and swung it hard to his mid-section , but Stowe stepped to one side , parried the swinging weapon and kicked the soldier neatly in the back of the left knee . He went down in a heap and several soldiers rushed Stowe . The52 THE CHINESE AGENDAsoldier he had knocked down , a short , thickset Tartar by his deep complexion and slanted eyes , got slowly to his feet and started toward Stowe , who stood waiting , shoulders hunched against the pressure of the arms that held him immobile . Gillon took a deep breath , forced himself to relax and eyed his guard warily , estimating his chances of jumping him ; from the corner of his eye he saw Jones and Leycock tensing . The officer snapped a command and the soldier hesitated . The officer spoke again , his voice cold and flat , and the Tartar stepped back , hitching his carbine sling and glaring at Stowe , suggesting plainly that the incident was by no means forgotten . The officer , hands behind his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " he stuttered in heavily accented English . " No permission . . . here . . . war base . " He waved at the floor again . " Sit . . . please . " When they still hesitated , the officer lost his patience and they were shoved down against the wall by the soldiers . Three remained , rifles ready , while the others withdrew to the far side of the room . At a brief word from the officer , they relaxed , dug cigarettes out of their parkas and lit up . One of the soldiers , a corporal from the markings on his hat , stepped forward and tossed a pack across the room to Leycock . Leycock looked at Jones , who shrugged . Leycock dug one out and handed the pack to Gillon , who took one and motioned to his pocket for a match . The soldier shook his head in warning and produced a small box of wooden matches , which he tossed across the room . Gillon caught it and lit the thin , flattened tube and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer potential must be fantastic . Stowe , still angry , hurled the cigarettes back across the room . " Damn it , this is ridiculous . There 's got to be somebody in the place who speaks English . . . or something besides Russian . This is nothing more than a lousy Communist stall ... " " Shut up , Stowe , before you get your head blown off . These people are n't fooling . " Jones sat back against the wall and stretchedTHE SOVIET UNION 53his legs out comfortably . But Gillon noticed that the hands he shoved into the parka 's pockets were shaking slightly . " You might as well make the best of it , because until someone comes to bail us out ... " " Maybe you think so . . . " Stowe started to get to his feet . The racketing blast of a carbine smashed through the room and splinters burst from the wall above Stowe 's head . He sat down abruptly . The Tartar soldier that he had knocked down lowered the muzzle until it was pointing directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxed slowly and settled back against the wall , being very careful that he made no sudden moves . Jones , too , half on his knees , hands pressed against the floor to spring , subsided as the machine gun waved in his direction . Stowe leaned forward slowly , then turned back to stare at the line of splintered bullet holes just above his head . For once , he was completely speechless . The Soviet officer had been halfway across the room when the firing started ; now he turned slowly , as if afraid of what he might see . His gaze raced over the four Americans and he exhaled in relief as he realized that the shots had been fired in warning . Be-fore he could react further , the door on the far side of the narrow room was flung open and a second Russian officer strode in . He took in the room in one quick glance and without breaking stride , walked across to the young officer . His voice was quiet enough as he spoke in Russian , but it was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , surprised by the sudden shots and even more sudden entry of the officer , were galvanized into action . The one with the carbine snapped to attention and the others retreated as fast as they could to the far side of the room . The first officer came quickly to attention , his face burning as he tried to explain . Apparently , he was successful , as far as Gillon could tell , because the newcomer nodded and snapped a single word . Both the soldier and the young officer were visibly relieved as he turned and strode across the room to stare down at the Americans . " You are Americans ? " he asked abruptly 54 THE CHINESE AGENDAJones nodded . " Yes , we are Americans . " " And what are you doing in the Soviet Union ? " Gillon could detect no trace of accent in his well-modulated voice . He could have grown up in any one of the northern mid-western states ; the only fault Gillon could detect was the too exact pronunciation . " What the devil do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are on a top-priority joint mission and our orders re-quire us to report to a Colonel Andre Dmietriev . " " There is no such person here , " the officer stated firmly . " You are American military personnel ? You arrived in an aircraft be-longing to the United States Air Force ? " Jones shook his head . " No , we do not belong to the military , the aircraft was ... " " Not military , " the Soviet officer interrupted smoothly . " If not military , then what ? " " Look , this is ridiculous , " Jones stammered . " If we did n't belong here , why did you let us land . Our pilot had clearances for this airfield , clearances that were issued in Moscow . We received per-mission to land from your own control tower ! " " And what would you do if a strange aircraft appeared on your radar screen ? We sent fighter aircraft in pursuit but before they could make contact , you had asked for permission to land . Since you did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let you land and then find out why . " " Nonsense , " Jones snorted . " If you had any doubts at all , you would have shot first and asked questions later . You are too damned close to the Chinese border for any other action to be considered . " " We are friendly with the People 's Republic of China and would have no cause to show alarm if one of their aircraft accidentally strayed across the border . " Gillon laughed at that and turned to Jones . " Brother , this guy is worse than a divorce lawyer . It looks to me like your people have fouled up this mission from the word go . " Jones turned on him , an angry retort ready , but Gillon ignored him and studied the Russian . " All right , buster , there 's one way that you can find out what'sTIIE SOVIET UNION 55going on here . Either your people do n't think you can be trusted " ... he paused to see if the Russian would take the bait  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . that is , of course , assuming that it ever left Washington . " " It did , " Stowe answered abruptly . " My people are in charge of liaison . I sent it out myself and got a forwarding acknowledgment before I left for Rome . " Jones , completely baffled , stared hard at Stowe , then sat back and began whistling tunelessly . " All right then , something happened . " Gillon felt his patience ebbing fast . " Get on the radio or telephone or drums or whatever the hell it is you people use to talk to one another and find out what the devil is going on . " " And who would you suggest I ask ? " The question was logical but the tone of voice was quite sarcastic . " Start with the GRU , " Gillon replied coldly . The officer straightened in surprise . " The GRU . . . why should I contact them ? " " Because , " Gillon snarled , his patience exhausted , " we are sup-posed to be co-operating with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units . If it is n't them , they can tell you which other agency . If your people spend as much time checking I up on each other as ours do , they 'll know . " The officer studied him for a long moment , as if not quite sure that Gillon was serious . Angrily , Gillon stared right back . The Russian took a deep breath and rubbed his forehead and eyes in weariness . " Your suggestion will be taken into consideration , " he replied slowly . " For the moment , you will remain under arrest since you have crossed the borders of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics illegally , landed a foreign military aircraft in a restricted area , resisted arrest and imported weapons in violation of Soviet laws . You will be placed under guard . I must warn you that any attempt to escape will be dealt with swiftly and harshly . I have given my men orders to shoot to kill . You must realize that you are very lucky that you were not shot down and killed during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and motioned the soldiers forward. 56 THE CHINESE AGENDAJones 's face reflected his shock and anger , but appreciating the uselessness of further argument , he remained silent . The two officers conferred in Russian for a moment and then the colonel turned and left abruptly and the lieutenant sauntered over and stared down at them in scorn . " Look your fill , sonny boy , " Leycock growled . " As soon as your boss gets his signals right , I 'm going to wipe your feet with your silly face . " The lieutenant pursed his lips at Leycock . He may not have understood the English , but the meaning was clear enough . He nodded and four soldiers came forward and , at gunpoint , they were herded back out into the icy cold of the Siberian morning and then marched toward a ramshackle building standing well back from the apron . What little paint had once coated the wood had long since peeled away under the onslaught of winter cold and summer sun . The walls were almost the same gray as the bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lieutenant hurried up the steps to push open the door . It resisted , and , suddenly angry at being made to look foolish , he bent and slammed it open with his shoulder . The door thudded back against the wall and the guards motioned for them to enter . One by one they climbed the rickety steps . The interior of the building was almost as cold as the exterior . A guard hurried to the stove , a battered old potbellied affair al-most completely red with rust , standing in the center of the room , and shoved in several sticks of wood , crumpled some sheets of newspaper and doused it all with kerosene . He stepped back and tossed a match into the stove and the fire lit with a loud , soft pop . The two-story building was constructed in the clapboard style that Gillon had seen used on World War II-vintage military bases the world over . Interior walls were screened off by thin panels of fiberboard ending several inches short of the ceiling . The floor was tiled with crumbling rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and summer heat . Gillon stumbled on one and received another jab with a rifle for his clumsiness . They reached the stairs at the far end of the barracks and were motioned up to the second floor . Puzzled , Gillon followedTHE SOVIET UNION 57the others up the steps . As far as he could see , the building was completely unoccupied and had been so for years . There was no season to take them up to the second floor , until he remembered the pipes radiating from the stove . Two went to the ceiling and since hot air rises , presumably , the second floor would warm faster . Very strange , he thought to himself . Why should they care whether we are cold or not ? At the top of the stairs , one of the guards pulled open the door of the first room in line and motioned Leycock inside . He hesitated a moment , then shrugged and grinned . " I guess we really do n't have much choice , do we ? " He stepped inside and the door was closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped it shut . The guards shoved them on down the corridor to the next room , where Stowe was detached and the process repeated . Jones was next and the last room , at the end of the corridor , was for Gillon . As he stepped inside , he saw a soldier dragging a chair to the head of the stairs . Obviously , they were going to be watched very carefully . The door was pushed shut behind him . It stuck in the jamb and Gillon heard a muffled curse and a heavy boot kicked it shut . A padlock snapped into the clasp and footsteps walked down the corridor . The soldier paused at the head of the stairs and spoke with the guard , then clattered down to the first floor and a door slummed . In the sudden silence that followed Gillon shoved his hands into his pockets and glanced about the room . It looked like it was going to be a long day . Shivering , he walked over and pressed his hand to the register set into the wall at floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and stooped down to examine it more closely . The register was almost closed and when he poked at it with a finger , it resisted and he concluded that it was rusted shut . Extracting the thin-bladed throwing knife from his boot top , he considered it thoughtfully , the Russian guard , the layout of the airfield and his chances of reaching the aircraft after dark . He concluded that they were pretty good , but that the chances of flying the Jetstar out of the Soviet Union were next to nil . With over four hundred58 THE CHINESE AGENDAmiles to go to reach the Afghan border , the nearest . . . if China was excepted . . . they would be after him in minutes . And the Jetstar , fast as it was , did not have the turn of speed necessary to outrace a Mach z fighter-interceptor . He shrugged and used the point of the knife to push open the register , then slipped it back into the boot top and stood up . It was strange , he thought , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe for one minute that the Russian officer did not know why they were in the Soviet Union . Soviet Air Force lieutenant generals were not sent to NATO briefings in Rome for curiosity 's sake . And then to allow things to be screwed up at some backwater military base was more than he could believe possible . Gillon wandered over to the lone , dirty window . He shook a cigarette out of the half-empty pack and lit it , staring thoughtfully at the airfield below . There were very many things about their treatment that puzzled him besides the fact that they had not been searched . For instance , the Jetstar . Right now he could see the Russian lieutenant strolling across the apron . The pilot saw him too and a moment later appeared in the hatch , hesitated , then climbed down and walked to meet him , hands waving in expressive gestures . The two met , and started back to the aircraft , deep in conversation . Gillon grunted ; either the pilot spoke Russian or the lieutenant spoke better English than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ladder , they were joined by the co-pilot and radio operator . The pilot waved at the barracks , the lieutenant shrugged . The pilot ticked off points on his fingers , the lieutenant shrugged . The co-pilot yelled , the lieutenant shrugged . The lieu-tenant spoke for some minutes , shrugged again and started back to the administration building . The co-pilot gestured obscenely while the pilot glanced toward the barracks , then shrugged him-self . Empathetically , Gillon shrugged with him and grinned at his own reaction . All very strange . Apparently the Russians were making no move to lock up the flight crew . A few minutes later , a ground support truck drove up and the co-pilot superintended the coupling of the nose gear to the trailerTHE SOVIET UNION 59tell . The truck then drove away , towing the aircraft with it and Ilion watched as it was pulled around to the far side of the agar and parked . The truck uncoupled and disappeared andflight crew apparently remained inside the aircraft . After aminutes in which nothing else happened , Gillon lost interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the terminal d was now waiting at the far end of the runway . A green  --  ht winked in the distant control tower and snow boiled off the way behind the tail as the roar of the engines , running up for eoff , reached him . The aircraft rolled ahead , gathered speed wn the runway , lifted smoothly and disappeared into the morn-g sky in a northwesterly direction . The slow rumble of the air-ft 's engines faded . The snowplow had finished its task and appeared . Nothing else moved on the field . The winter stillness bright sun and burnished cold closed down . Gillon turned away from the window to survey the drab , bare  --  m with distaste . A steel-frame bed covered with a thin blanketd thinner mattress stood against one wall . Other than the bed , . ere was not another stick of furniture in the room . It was , though , . noted with some gratitude , beginning to warm up as the fire the stove on the floor below gained ground on the entire winter 's Id . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened , hear-g nothing but the noise of the guard shifting in his chair the far end of the hall . He knocked again . First a groan , then tsteps started down the hall , pausing at each door . Gillon . ocked again and the footsteps hurried to his door and stopped  --  ctside . The padlock clicked , then a rifle 's safety catch . The door as pulled , stuck , and pulled again , harder . It swung open ande guard stood framed outside , carbine pointing into the room . Gillon smiled at him in what he hoped was a friendly fashion . " How about something to read ? " he asked , not really expectingthe guard to understand and pantomiming the flipping of magazinepages . It took a moment or two but finally he made the soldierunderstand and as a final touch , pantomimed smoking a cigarette . le soldier understood that right away and he pushed the door ut and hurried off down the hall. 60 THE CHINESE AGENDAINow , how about that , Gillen thought to himself , and pushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . A careless guard . . . not likely . These people did not impress him as being careless , or forgetful . Perhaps they wanted him to try and walk away from the room ? Then they could shoot him and claim that he tried to escape . Again not likely ; otherwise why go to all the trouble to lock them up in the first place ; why not just march them outside and shoot them down ? Gillon scratched his head , pushed the door shut and wandered back to the window to stand thinking until the guard returne and pushed the door open . He stepped into the room , a wi grin on his face and arms full of magazines . On top of the pile rested two packs of cigarettes . Gillon grinned back and relieve him of the load , noting that his rifle was carelessly slung over his shoulder , where it would be out of the way . . . and out of reach as well . " Spasebo . " Gillon grinned back and the guard touched his cap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dumped them on the bed . . . and swore loudly . A of them were printed in bright colors on relatively good quail paper , and of recent vintage . But they were all in Russian . Ah well , he decided , lit a cigarette and slumped down on the bed , bunching his parka behind his head for a pillow , and picked up the top magazine . There was nothing else to do and lon hours ahead to kill and since no explanation of the quirky thin that were happening was forthcoming . . . at least the magazin were full of pictures . The day ground on to its conclusion in a burst of color ov the western edge of the airfield . The weather had faded durin the long afternoon from its wintry beauty of sunshine , blue shado and ice as a heavy cloud cover edged across the sky . The than in weather brought a drastic drop in temperature and , by evenin the single window overlooking the runway was completely frost over . Gillon used his knife to scrape away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked the limits of the airfield red along the runways and blue for the apron and taxiways . Th splashes of color circled the snow beneath each light , but as thenTHE SOVIET UNION 61were no halos visible in the air Gillon knew that the temperature was well below freezing and the air intensely dry . Behind him on the bed , the remains of an excellent hot meal shared space with the unreadable magazines . As he gazed through the frost-rimmed patch of cleared window , a snowflake drifted by . A moment later another and another until the sky was full of soft , gliding flakes fluttering down in the still air . At least the snow , he knew , would keep the temperature from dropping much below zero  --  not that it would be of much concern to him in his present predicament . Whatever game the Russians were playing , they were not about to let them into China . He had concluded that the Russians , in spite of the potential importance of the documents , had contracted a case of diplomatic cold feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ace-saving device . Rather than admit that they were afraid ofe Chinese , the Kremlin could easily justify their withdrawalm the mission by claiming an administrative error had delayede start of the mission until it was too late . Then they could apologize and send the Americans packing . He heard footsteps below and the sound of someone kicking his heels against the risers of the steps to dislodge caked snow . A moment later , footsteps came up the stairs and marched downe hall . Doors were unlocked and a voice called in bad English/ them to come out . His own door was thrown open and a heavyset non-commisioned officer glanced at him with indifference and motioned him out . Gillon picked up his parka and stepped through the door tod Stowe , Jones and Leycock and three armed soldiers gathereda little knot in the middle of the hall waiting for him . " We were just comparing notes , " Leycock said as he joinedem . " Apparently we 've all come to the conclusion that the ussians have gotten scared and are stalling until its too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us out of the country . What do you say ? " Gillon , somewhat surprised that all four of them had reachede same conclusion independently , nodded in agreement . " I do n't know if anybody else could see the Jetstar , " he added , 62 THE CHINESE AGENDA " but they towed it around to the back of a hangar and left it there . That 's all , just left it there . As far as I know , the crew is still inside . " " I saw that too , " Jones murmured . " This whole setup really stinks . . . the guards are just too damned careless . . . " The non-corn came up at that point and shooed them toward the stairs . They went down the steps , along the hall and out into the cold night ; a cold so sudden in its intensity that it caught them all by surprise , whisked their breath away and left them coughing . " You know . . . " Stowe managed to choke out finally . " Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . fouled up . " He caught his breath and pulled the sleeve of his jacket across his mouth and chin . " Can you imagine spending twenty-four hours a day for two or three days out in this stuff ? " " Just hope to God , " Jones said , " that they do n't intend to send us to a labor camp . Otherwise , you 'll see a hell of a lot more of this kind of weather . " The grimness in his voice drove away the touch of euphoria that had begun to affect them all . They were lined up in single file , two soldiers to a man , and trotted through the falling snow under a blaze of arc lights to the same administration building in which they had been questioned that morning , each expecting to be told that everything had been straightened out but that it was too late and therefore the mission had been canceled . Gillon found himself hoping that he was wrong , a reversal of his previous attitude , he realized with surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to renege , then Jack Liu would be left holding the bag . And if that happened , there was nothing , absolutely nothing that Gillon could do for him . The interior of China was a hell of a long way in space and time and condition from the Laotian border area . They were brought to a halt outside the door and while the non-com slipped inside and slammed the door shut , they all , guards included , stamped their feet and huddled against the icy wind . The non-com came back out a moment later and motioned them inside . Gillon gasped in the sudden change of temperature and the combination of heat and bright overhead fluorescent tubesTHE SOVIET UNION 63filled his eyes with tears , blinding him for a moment . He rubbed his fingers across his eyes to rid them of the tears and finally could make out a group of men standing in front of him . From their bearing and uniforms , they were officers , and Gillon realized with a shock that two of the men were Orientals , wearing the khaki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People 's Republic of China . Chapter 7Four officers , two of them Russian , two of them Chinese , faced the four Americans . The Soviet officer , a colonel , whom they had met earlier waved his hand to indicate that they were to line up against the wall . Collectively stunned by the unexpected turn of events , they shuffled into position and only then did Gillon hear Stowe begin to curse non-stop under his breath as the shock of the Chinese uniforms began to wear off . Afterward , Gillon could notall when he had ever been as surprised , surprised to the pointbeing unable even to formulate words of protest . Both sidesared at one another for a long moment and the silence in theerheated room was devastating . " What the hell ... P " Jones began . " Be silent , " the Russian officer snapped , and that broke the oment of time in which they had all been suspended . The  --  lonel bent over to converse with one of the Chinese officers , .. en straightened at his nod . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of their controlled .1 tures Gillon could sense that they were angry , intensely angry , t at the same time also pleased , as if they had been vindicated. e colonel murmured once more and the Chinese nodded care-Hy . " We have checked your story , as you suggested , " the colonel gan , and nodded toward Gillon . " As we suspected , it is a lie ) m beginning to end . There is no officer named Andre Dmietriev this base or anywhere within the Soviet armed forces and your Ic of orders to report to this fictitious gentleman at this installation worse than foolish . I can only surmise that you were planning68 THE CHINESE AGENDAsome type of intrusion into the People 's Republic of China when your aircraft was forced down here . He paused and looked at them carefully , as if to gauge the effect of his words . Stowe was now standing rigidly against the wall , staring at him . Leycock had lounged back and was gazing around the room as if bored . Only Jones appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he held himself in check . The colonel drew himself up straight and clasped his hands behind his back . " You are accused by the People 's Republic of China of attempting to gain illegal entrance into China to rendezvous with bandits and then to carry out sabotage , murder and espionage . Your attempt to involve this nation in your scheme is reprehensible , to say the least . " A feeling of complete unreality swept over Gillon . Something had gone wrong , terribly wrong . The colonel sounded to Gillon as if he were reading a prepared script . Gillon shook his head and the Russian caught the slight movement . " Ah , you seek to deny it , do you ? Well , this information and my instructions come to me from the highest levels in Moscow . " He paused to lend weighted emphasis to his words . " You will be placed into the custody of General Lin Chuo "  --  he nodded to his left  --  " and flown to Peking , where you will be put on trial for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he finished , the four Americans stared at him in stunned silence . Even Leycock had lost his air of boredom and his mouth was open in total surprise . Jones started forward , only to bo shoved back by a guard . He shook himself free , shouting , " You ca n't do that . We have not violated Chinese territory . We are still in the Soviet Union and therefore the Chinese Government has no legal jurisdiction . " " Ah , but there you are wrong , my dear sir , " the Chinese general broke in , his English soft and accentless . " In China , it is held that the thought is partner to the deed . You have contemplated a crime , planned it carefully and attempted to carry it out . There-fore , legally , you have committed that violation , even though youTILE TIEN SHAN 69were prevented from doing so . To have allowed you to commit the crime would have been foolish in the extreme . " Jones spat out a curse . " That , sir , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It will do you no good to argue , " the other Soviet officer , who had so far remained silent , interrupted . " The decision has already been made . You will be flown tonight to Peking and there stand trial for your crimes . " Gillon looked at the officer who had just spoken . Tall , broad and bullnecked . He wore the uniform of the Soviet Army but his lapel was adorned with the insignia of the GRU , the Chief Intelligence Directorate of the Soviet General Staff . So , they really had checked as Gillon had facetiously suggested . A shock of graying blond hair surmounted a seamed and weathered face . This man spent a good deal of time outdoors , he thought . General Lin laughed at Jones . " We have conclusive evidence that you were to meet a group of Nationalist Chinese gangsters and together engage in sabotage to the nuclear testing installations at Lop Nor . Understandably enough , in this time of strained relations , the Soviet Union resents your attempts to involve them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , I might acid , the Soviet Government has been very co-operative . " If that was the story the Chinese had been told , Gillon thought , ft helped bring into perspective everything that had happened so far . The Red Chinese could very well have learned the broad details of the mission in Taiwan . . . they probably had as manyies in the Nationalist government as the Nationalists had ine Communist government . They would have known that theericans had been asked to help . From Phan Duc Phnom , theyuld have learned that the Russians were involved before heed . A little pressure applied to the Kremlin could easily havereed them to reconsider their commitment to assist the Amerins . Now that the Vietnam War was over , the U.S. was relatively.e of foreign encumbrances while the Russians were heavilymmitted in the Middle East and more and more so in Northeastrica . The wisdom of engaging in a border clash with China , at and the effect on Sine-American rapprochement that the70 THE CHINESE AGENDAcapture of the Americans would have , must certainly have seemed attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the sick look on Jones 's face , Gillon knew that he had reached the same conclusion . So much for their optimistic conclusion less than ten minutes ago that the Soviets were sending them to Moscow . They were going on a trip all right , but in the opposite direction .. . to Peking . Stowe had remained impassive following his initial outburst and Leycock was now staring at the floor , as if disinterested in the proceedings . " Just how did ... ? " Gillon started to ask , but the GRU officer cut him off sharply and snapped an order in Russian . Before he could demand that his question be answered , they were pushed into position by soldiers and forced out into the freezing night . They were marched at a trot to an aircraft waiting on the apron , where its brightly lit interior spilled out in yellow patches onto the snow- and ice-covered concrete . As they reached the foot of the ladder , Stowe unexpectedly sidestepped away from his guard and before the soldier could react , had lashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stowe was smothered by soldiers . One swung his carbine , hitting him a glancing blow across the shoulders that nevertheless was sufficient to stun him . Stowe went down without a sound . Gillon started forward but a bayoneted rifle thrust toward his stomach brought him up short . The GRU officer materialized at his side and Gillon roared at him . " Tell this bastard to back off or I 'll take that rifle away from him and shove it down his throat ! " The intelligence officer threw a surprised glance at him and , grinning , ordered the guard to back off before pointing to the guards lifting Stowe off the snow . " If you do not wish to receive similar treatment , then you will all behave yourselves . " Jones cursed him roundly but he turned away , still smiling . The area surrounding the aircraft had been lit by a series of portable floodlights and , though the light was dimmed by the heavy snowfall , Gillon saw that the aircraft was an old Russian turboprop transport with Chinese markings . Two Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two more below . The Russian guards had backed away , leaving Gillon , Leycock and Jones standing at the foot of the ladder with the two Russian officers and the Chinese General Lin . Gillon surmised that the second Chinese officer , who had remained inside , was to go on to Moscow . A moment later four Russian soldiers pushed past , loaded down with the duffle bags and packs , and disappeared up the ladder and into the aircraft . General Lin lit a cigarette and standing to one side watched the three Americans with an air of expectancy . The soldiers trotted back down the gangway , and Stowe was carried up and into the cabin . Gillon , watching them haul Stowe 's unconscious form up the steps , had turned to say something to Jones when his guard jolted him with the rifle . Gillon started to swing round on him but the two Chinese guards at the bottom of the steps pushedm away . The Russian jabbed him again with the rifle butt , es glistening with anticipation . Gillon forced himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his anger barely mtained . They ducked and stepped into the brightly lit interior , linking against the lights . Stowe had been shoved down into a at at the back of the cabin . As they walked past , he groaned and shed himself carefully into a sitting position , rubbing the back his neck . Jones , Leycock and Gillon were led up the aisle and otioned into seats well away from one another . The Chinese lards followed them down the aisle , stopping at each seat to andcu$ each by one wrist to a steel bar let into the bulkhead . side the seat . Two of the Chinese soldiers took up positions at the frontthe cabin , their backs against the bulkhead separating thebin from the cockpit . A moment later , a Russian sergeant pushedwn the aisle , bringing with him a curious assortment of odors , cohol , heavy , biting Balkan tobacco and the freshness of coldsir and snow , as well as a large duffle bag , which he slung intoseat across from Gillon . He paused to stare down at Gillon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slid intoseat directly in front of him . Gillon noticed that the sergeant72 THE CHINESE AGENDAwas wearing the same GRU insignia and , puzzled , Gillon glanced over his shoulder in time to see General Lin come aboard , followed by the Soviet GRU officer . Both were laughing at some joke and they settled themselves companionably into seats in the back of the aircraft . One more Chinese soldier hurried aboard , trotted up the aisle and disappeared into the cockpit . Almost immediately , the starboard engine began to turn , its high-pitched turbine whine rising until the engine exploded into a cloud of smoke that was whipped to tatters as the propeller bit into the cold air . Very curious , Gillon thought . Two Soviet military intelligence operatives aboard the same aircraft taking them into China . Perhaps they had been sent along as witnesses , although that hardly seemed necessary . Very curious indeed . Again that same sense of bewilderment swept over him . Very little of what was happening made sense . There was something missing , something definitely missing , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jack Liu was holding for them was important , in fact down-right more important to the Soviets than to the Americans . As that State Department clown had pointed out , the United States was taking a big chance with this mission whereas the Soviets , with a three-thousand-mile contiguous border and their already strained relations with China , were not . And surely the situation , the data at stake , were not important enough to risk threatening the Soviet Union with war . Since the Communist take-over in 1949 , the Chinese had always been militarily conservative , fighting beyond their borders only when forced into it . They did not enter the Korean War until American troops were standing on the Yalu River border ; did not attack India until the Indians had repeatedly sent troops into China ; never did send combat troops to Vietnam . And their previous set-tos with the Soviets had been limited to a lot of name-calling and border skirmishes only in areas historically belonging to China . It just did not make sense and . . . if the Soviets had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese ? Why not just send them packing and be done with it ? Then if the Chinese protested , they could say with a clear con-science and nothing to hide that they had in fact been approached by the United States for help , but had turned them down . ThatTHE TEEN SHAN 73would avoid any possible conflict with China as well as set back the Sino-American rapprochement . . . a situation patently dangerous to Russia if allowed to progress very far . The way he saw it , turning them over to the Chinese was tantamount to admitting involvement , no matter what was said officially . Gillon shook his head , nothing seemed to make sense , yet he knew that none of the three governments involved ever took a step without a plan . The plan itself might often be utterly foolish , but every action had a logic of its own . Both engines were running to power now and Gillon felt the plane move forward , edging slowly away from the hangar area . When they reached the end of the taxiway and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them just gathering speed down the runway . Gillon watched it reach flight speed and leave the runway . For a moment , the aircraft was silhouetted against the white snowfield and he was positive that it was the Jetstar . The aircraft banked sharply around to the north and disappeared from his field of view . North , he thought . If they were going north it probably meant Moscow . At least the Russians were not giving up the Jetstar to the Chinese . Gillon hoped that the flight crew was still aboard and that they would prove resourceful enough to find a way of notifying Washington of what had happened . Since they had been warned that the State Department would not intercede if they were caught , their chances of getting out of this situation were not good . Gillon shifted uncomfortably in the seat . The sharp metal ring of the handcuff bit painfully into his wrist . There would be a trial in Peking , he knew , one in which trumped-up evidence would play a big part . And if the Chinese were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States was hypocritical in its dealings , the trial would receive wide international publicity and the sentences would be severe . Probably not death , but at least twenty years in prison . Somehow , death might be preferable . The transport had turned onto the runway ; the engines ran tip and , as the brakes were released , it leaped forward , rushing down the icy runway . Gillon felt the tail section begin to sway back and forth but a moment later , the wheels broke free and74 Tim CHINESE AGENDAthey were airborne . The runway dropped beneath and Gillon 's field of vision expanded , then steadied as the ground fell away , encompassing first the apron , then the hangar area and finally the entire airfield before it disappeared astern . Then there was nothing but the wide , empty steppe with here and there an occasional light to mark a lonely building and to the east , the pale towers of the Tien Shan . The flight into China was silent . For a long time , the transport had circled , climbing for altitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gradually , the distant features of the steppe had faded below , leaving nothing but a faint glimmer of starlight on snow . The flanks of the Tien Shan had merged into black silhouettes of grinding teeth , blocking the stars with their bulk . The murmur of conversation from the back of the cabin , where the two officers sat together , had died away following takeoff . Gillon sat back in the worn seat and tried to relax . He had calculated that with the probable range of the aircraft they would make two refueling stops ; the first at Urumchi in Sinkiang , the second somewhere in Kansu and then the final landing at Peking . Six thousand miles almost and at an average speed of 300 miles an hour , they would reach the capital in twenty to twenty-four hours . Gillon looked around the cabin again but the high seat backs obscured his view and the handcuff kept him in place . From the sound of his deep breathing , Jones was asleep , and Leycock and Stowe were both out of his line of vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front bulkhead , swaying gently with the easy motion of the aircraft , and Gillon wondered if they were going to remain there during the entire flight . The Russian sergeant was slumped well down in the seat , his feet propped on the armrest of the seat across the aisle , asleep to all appearances . An hour after takeoff , Gillon heard laughter from the back and the rustle of what sounded like a map being unfolded . A fewTHE .0 EN SHAN 75minutes later he looked around to see General Lin standing in the aisle beside his seat , facing Jones . " We are now in the People 's Republic of China , " he said , smiling down in a friendly fashion at Jones . " Shove it , " Jones murmured . " Come now , that is no way to talk . We all play a game . Unfortunately , you have selected the losing side . " " No , " Jones said mildly , " not the losing side . . . just a real loser for a teammate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Russians , " Jones snarled . " It 's too bad that during the kangaroo trial coming up we wo n't be allowed to tell the full ory . Lin bent over to beam at him . " That really will not be necessary , ally not necessary at all . " Gillon had to strain to hear this urmured response . " However , no matter how well-intentioned your motives , it will you no good . Your government has trifled with mine long ough . Many of us have warned that the perfidious American armongers were only disguising themselves ... " Lin continued in this vein and Gillon grimaced . One of the wks , he thought . There was no hope for them at all if these ple were in , or near to being in , control ... no matter how ch he was forced to admit that there might now be some tification to Lin 's charge . " Shove it , " Jones repeated , and Lin chuckled , then suddenly ed him on the ear . " You bloody . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing but there was nothing he could do to prevent it . Lin w his pistol , reversed it in his hand and used the butt to Jones viciously across the temple . Jones groaned once and roped back , blood welling out of a deep cut above his temple . lon found himself on his feet , swearing violently , his right arm tight against the bulkhead by the handcuff . Lin smiled thinly d turned , raising the pistol to strike again . A shot blasted through cabin and Lin jolted forward , caught his balance and turned the rear of the cabin . Gillon saw his look of utter astonishment76 THE CHINESE AGENDAas he faced the Soviet GRU colonel , now standing in the aisle . The colonel took slow aim and fired the pistol once more , striking Lin squarely in the chest . Lin 's own pistol dropped from his nerveless fingers and he crumpled forward . Behind Gillon , the sergeant was moving like a dancer , twisting out of his seat and drawing his own revolver at the same time . The colonel fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand lying across his left forearm . Gillon stared for an eternity down the muzzle before it fired for the third time . . . past his shoulder and struck the Chinese soldier on the left side of the cabin . At the same time the sergeant shot twice , dropping the soldier standing to the right of the door . The cockpit door was thrust open and a rifle poked out . The sergeant jumped to the left and fired twice inside as the colonel raced up the aisle . The cockpit guard crumpled to his knees and the sergeant fired once more , into the back of the neck and he slumped face forward onto the floor in a welter of blood . The Russian officer hurdled the body and slammed into the cockpit . Three shots were fired in quick succession and the aircraft banked abruptly to the left and fell off the port wing , throwing Gillon forward and wrenching the skin from his wrist , where the handcuff dragged at the flesh . The transport tipped into the slow twist that preceded a spin , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself and , a moment later , the engines were running up to full rated power , dragging the nose up , and she began to come level once more . Gillon untangled himself from the seat and got shakily to his , feet . The three Chinese soldiers were dead . One body had rolled across the cabin in the violence of the spin and lay on its back , sightless eyes staring at the ceiling . Lin was on his back , astonishment still evident in his staring eyes , a thin trickle of blood running idly down his cheek . The sergeant had been thrown hard to the deck by the sudden movement of the aircraft . He got to his feet , shaking his head , swayed in the aisle a moment and grabbed a seat back to steady himself . Then he walked carefully to Lin , stooped down and went through his pockets until he found the key to the handcuffs . THE 11 EN SHAN 77Without a word , he reached back and handed the key to Gillon , then bent over Jones 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuffs , unlocked them , and tossed the set to Leycock , who released both his and Stowe 's . Leycock tensed and Gillon heard the hiss of his indrawn breath . He turned to see the GRU colonel standing in the cockpit doorway , pistol still in his hand but grinning from ear to ear . The colonel laughed and snapped the magazine out to show that it was empty . As if nothing had happened , he slipped a fresh magazine into the pistol , snapped the slide back to load a cartridge into the chamber , put the safety on and shoved it back into his holster . Still wary , Leycock came up the aisle and knelt down beside Jones . The sergeant backed out of the way while Leycock undid the handcuffs and examined his bleeding head . The sergeant walked down the aisle to the colonel and spoke to him in Russian , gesturing at Jones . Gillon caught a trace of concern on his face and hastily leaned over the seat . Stowe came up and together the three of them got Jones lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His breathing was shallow , his skin almost gray and covered with a thin film of sweat . Leycock rubbed his wrists and chest and Stowe hurried back down the aisle to where the packs were piled in one of the rear seats and came back with a first-aid kit . He found an ammonia ampul , broke it and waved it under Jones 's nose . Jones coughed and feebly pushed the ampul away . Leycock pressed him back to the floor and his color and breathing began to return to normal . After a minute or so , Leycock held up three fingers . " How many ? " " Seven , dammit , let me up ... " " Okay , but take it easy ... " Leycock helped him into the seat and stepped back while Stowe went to work with swab and antiseptic to clean the gash that the pistol butt had left above his temple . " Ye gods , take it easy , " Jones whispered between clenched teeth . Stowe grunted and finished up , dabbed an antibiotic ointmenti ! 78 THE CHINESE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he shook two tablets out of a bottle and offered them to Jones . Leycock handed him a canteen and they both insisted that he swallow the tablets . " They 're just aspirin . And you are going to have one hell of a headache in a few moments . " Jones nodded and swallowed the tablets , then leaned his head back against the seat . Stowe adjusted it until it was almost horizontal . " All right , Colonel , fun and game times are over , " Gillon said tightly , turning to the two Russians talking together at the front of the cabin . " What the hell is this all about ? " The colonel smiled easily and came down the aisle to them . " I would not really blame you if you were angry . It is a very dirty trick to play . But we had no other choice . My name is Andre Dmietriev and this is my friend and associate Sergeant Anton Rodek . We are the two other members of this apparently ill-fated venture . " Gillon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing had made sense so far . Why should it start now ? Stowe moved up the aisle as if to back him up and Leycock got slowly to his feet , his hands relaxed at his side . Gillon glanced at Stowe , noting that his face , although still pale with the after-effects of his beating , was set into hard lines of anger . " Ill-fated is the word , Colonel . Perhaps you will explain what all this nonsense is about and who these people are . . . were , " he corrected himself . " Certainly , but first . . . " He said something to Rodek in Russian . Rodek nodded and stepped into the cockpit . Dmietriev waited a moment , a look of concentration on his face , and Gillon felt the roar of the engines deepen and the deck under his feet tilted upward slightly . " Sergeant Rodek is an excellent pilot . He feels that perhaps a bit more altitude is necessary . In view of the height of these mountains , " he finished , half-apologetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tien Shan by now and he stooped to peer through the window . " No , " Dmietriev smiled , " I am afraid it is too dark to seeTHE TIEN SHAN 79anything . The moon will not rise for several hours yet . Now come , " he invited , " let 's be seated and I will tell you what has happened . " He gestured to the seats and , rubbing his aching wrist , Gillon sat down on the armrest . Stowe took the seat across the aisle from Jones while Leycock remained standing . " I am afraid this deception , hard on you as it was , was completely necessary . As you probably know , one of your operatives was murdered in Rome . Behind him , Gillon heard the sudden intake of breath as Jones reacted to this news . Gillon felt the same way . How the hell had the Russians found out so quickly ? Dmietriev laughed at their response . " But you forget , we are supposed to be partners in this operation . We knew of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been killed .. . knew from two sources , I might add . Your people and our own channels of communication . " Dmietriev paused and looked at them . Gillon could feel the hostility that was being directed toward the Russian by the other three . It seemed foolish to him , but then he thought , perhaps if he was as involved in intelligence work as they were , he might feel the Same way . It all seemed like pure nonsense to him , serving only to aggravate the differences between nations . " So , " Dmietriev continued , " we are now quite certain that he as killed by the Chinese . I say this because within hours of ur man 's death , the Ambassador of the People 's Republic of Ina handed our Foreign Minister a note of diplomatic protest uched in the strongest terms . This mission is as important to us it is to your country , perhaps more so since we share common rders with China . As far as my country is concerned , that data ust be retrieved at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me byless than the Minister of Defense himself . So we devised this e drama to convince the Chinese that we had nothing to with you , that everything was the exclusive idea of the Unitedates . I must say that there are certain elements in my government , there are in the Chinese Government , that have reacted withng approval to the idea of destroying whatever progress hadn achieved to date in the American-Chinese talks . " 80 THE CHINESE AGENDADmietriev glanced at his watch as he continued . " So you were put under arrest as soon as you landed at Ala Kul . . . I trust it did not prove onerous ? " He was met by a stony silence and chuckled . " We knew that the Chinese would be arriving within hours of your aircraft .. . we could only hope that it would be after and not before . Both of your arrivals coincided so closely in fact that we did not have time to explain to you what was happening . . . which from my standpoint was just as well , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying then , " Stowe broke in , " that this whole business was just a sham to convince the Chinese that the Russians had nothing to do with this mission . . ? You really did n't expect them to believe that , did you ? " Dmietriev laughed . " If you were a bit more familiar with the art of diplomacy , my friend , you would see that as having no bearing on the matter at all . Of course they did not believe us . . . but that is not what they were asking . The Chinese Government warned my government that there would be serious repercussions if we allowed the mission to take place . So we agreed that the mission would be halted by simply arresting you and your friends and turning you over to the Chinese Government . " Now that we have done so , we are no longer responsible for what happens . You see , a Chinese officer stayed behind to report to Peking as well as to the Chinese Embassy in Moscow . He saw you put aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers go aboard , but did not see either Sergeant Rodek or myself follow . After he boarded the aircraft in which you arrived , a message came for General Lin , informing him that two Soviet military personnel would accompany him to Peking .. . Sergeant Rodek and myself . . . to assist in the trial . Of course the message was unimpeachable as it was in the latest Chinese military codes . " Gillon raised his eyebrows at this news and Stowe , Jones and Leycock exchanged glances . " Of course , the message was completely false , " Dmietriev continued modestly . " So far as the Soviet Union is concerned weTHE ' 11rN SHAN 81have complied with the Chinese request . If the escort should prove incapable of controlling their prisoners , that , of course , is their problem . " So it will appear that you left Ala Kul earlier tonight after General Lin sent a wireless message informing Peking of the time of departure . . . and after being seen aboard by one of their own people . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had crossed the border . Our flight records will show that this aircraft left on schedule and radar logs on both sides will show that this same aircraft crossed the border still on schedule . In fact , the pilot was to report his position every half-hour . It has now been fifteen minutes since he last did so and we are wasting valuable time talking . This aircraft will crash in twenty minutes and we do not want to be aboard when it does so . It will appear , " he finished triumphantly , " that once having overpowered your captors , you were unable to fly the aircraft and it crashed in a remote area of the Tien Shan . Very neat , hey ? " " Very neat is right , " Jones murmured . " You say twenty minutes ? Where will that put us ? " " Right in the middle of the scheduled drop zone . Unknown to them and fortunately for us , they were flying very close to the route we would have taken if we had not been discovered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shan to Urumchi , where normally an aircraft would refuel . " " So we have n't really lost anything then , " Leycock put in , more 1- statement of fact than question . " Nothing but time , " Jones answered . He glanced at his watch . We are now about four hours behind schedule . That means thate must camp on the north side of the pass and wait to crossmorrow . . . tonight really . So we lose more than fifteen hours total . " " You are right , but I am afraid that can not be helped . And , we waste any more time , we will lose more than that . " Dmietriev ood up . " I suggest , Mr. Jones , " he said formally , all trace of his bantering82 THE CHINESE AGENDAtone disappearing , " that you have your people change into their cold-weather gear and check their equipment and weapons . " Jones nodded and struggled up out of the seat . Leycock tried to make him sit still , but Jones insisted that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , still protesting . Jones was moving carefully , holding his head erect , as if even the slightest movement hurt him . Great , he thought , they had n't even started yet and already one of the group was injured , and injured worse than he was willing to admit . Gillon had a premonition , sitting on the armrest of the seat in the warm , well-lit cabin of the aircraft , that there were drastic days ahead for Jones as well as for the rest of them . Shaking his head , he followed Jones and Leycock to the rear of the cabin to sort out gear . Stowe busied himself with checking and loading weapons . Dmietriev disappeared into the cockpit and after a moment , Rodek came hurrying back through the cabin to his duffle bag . He placed it on a seat , opened it and began to pull out cold-weather clothes and weapons similar to their own . Two AK-47 machine guns were included and two large-caliber pistols that Gillon could not identify . Two long paper-wrapped parcels were produced from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit , containing skis and snowshoes for both Russians . The other bag contained hiking packs , sleeping bags and wax-paper-wrapped blocks of gelignite explosive . Whistling soundlessly , Rodek went to work and Gillon stopped for a moment to watch him . Rodek inserted an igniter into each block of explosive and lined them up on the seat one after another . When he had finished , six two-pound blocks of gelignite stood in a row , enough to blow the entire aircraft to kingdom come and then some . Chapter 8While Rodek went about his own tasks , the four Americans completed a final distribution of supplies to the packs . Then each of them stripped down and struggled into the insulated under-clothing and one-piece snowsuits . Gillon found that his suit fitted as if it had been tailored for him . Jones watched , grinning , and admitted that his uniform sizes had been obtained from the Army . " We made allowances for any weight you might have gainedce . Gillon snorted . " I weigh less now than I did the day I regned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and into the cockpit . A moment later , Dmietriev me hurrying out . " Five minutes , " he snapped . " You will find a cargo parachute one of those bags . I suggest that you lash everything together d the first one out the door will have to be responsible for aching it go down . " Ile threw off his own clothing and began to dress quickly . here are also six parachutes in the galley . I supervised their ; king myself this afternoon ; you can be quite certain they will n . This was one phase of the exercise that Gillon was not lookingand to at all . His entire jumping experience consisted of the S. Army airborne course at Fort Benning , nearly twelve years ore , and he had not jumped since . Lcycock and Stowe fetched the chutes from the rear of the bin and dumped them down on the floor . Stowe held one up , standard backpack type which Gillon recognized as a sportchute that provided a great deal more steerability than thedard military chute. 84 THE CHINESE AGENDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety chutes ? " " Sorry . " Dmietriev grinned . " No way to get them aboard . Yo will just have to take your chances and rely on the Soviet Force . " The news apparently did nothing to cheer Stowe , from th scowl he gave Dmietriev , but he slipped his chute on anywa and buckled it up . Dmietriev unfolded a map and spread it out on his knew He studied it for a moment , then called Jones over to him . Jones got up from the seat and made his way back to the Russi Gillon could n't be sure but he thought he noticed a slight stagg in his walk . The two of them bent over the map for sever minutes , then , satisfied , Jones nodded , made some notes on own map and came back up the aisle . Dmietriev folded his ma and slipped it into his parka , then glancing at his watch on more , hurried back up the aisle , parachute dangling from his a " All right , you guys , " Jones called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the jump zone . " Rodek stepped out of the cockpit and gathered up his pa and parachute . An air of expectancy began to build as Jon chivied them forward to the crew hatch . Dmietriev was standin half in and half out of the cockpit door from where he coiil keep an eye on the control panel . The aircraft was flying slowly that they were being buffeted from side to side by t winds . Dmietriev had stopped the air-conditioning system a the air was rapidly growing thin . . . and very cold . Stowe a Rodek dragged the body of one of the Chinese soldiers out the way and Jones started to undo the hatch . Dmietriev glanc over his shoulder , caught Rodek 's eye and nodded . Rodek knew and fussed with the gelignite charges he had placed in sea on both sides of the fuselage in back of the wings . Dmietri jammed a long crowbar through the rubber seal and worked i into the crack between the hatch and coaming . He motioned to Gillon and together they heaved once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , punched through the two-hundred  --  mile-an-hour slipstream by the cabin 's higher air pressure . Instantly , the cabin was full of whirling debris as the air rushed out and THE TIEN SHHAN 85he grabbed a seat back to steady himself against its tug . The temperature plummeted abruptly and Gillon gasped in surprise at its icy clutch . Leycock stumbled forward with the backpacks and du 8 e bags lashed into a single large bundle and placed them near the door . Ile opened the cargo chute pack and extracted the rip cord , which he tied to a seat stanchion . It was difficult to hear over the wail of air rushing past the aircraft and Leycock pointed to himself and then down , indicating to Jones that he would go first . Jones nodded in a distracted way and Gillon started to move toward him , then thought better of it . There was nothing that could be done now in any case . There was no turning back . Unless this aircraft crashed somewhere in the mountains or re-appeared on the southern side of the Tien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chinese fighter air-craft would reach them before they could get back across the border . Through the open hatch , he could make out the dark silhouettes of the surrounding peaks reaching almost level with the aircraft . Ile glanced into the cockpit and located the altimeter ; it read 18,000 feet , hardly higher than some of the peaks around them . I ) mietriev stepped out of the cockpit , glancing at his watch again , and motioned them to gather around him . " We are coming up on the jump zone . " He shouted to make himself heard above the scream of air past the open hatch . " Jump when I give the signal and all go out as fast as possible . As each man lands , shine your flashlight so that the others can find you . Do you all understand ? " They nodded and he turned to Rodek , who had come up after finishing with the last of the charges . Rodek nodded and shouted in Russian . " IIe says , " Drnietriev translated at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go off in ten minutes . That should give us plenty of time . The aircraft will be fifty miles southeast of us when it crashes . " Gillon was conscious of his laboring lungs as they fought to aw in sufficient oxygen , as well as an icy feeling that had86 Tim CHINESE AGENDAnothing to do with the cold wind blowing in through the open hatch . He felt giddy and nauseated . The sickly gleam of the lights in the foggy interior of the cabin emphasized the shadows on each face , accentuating the apprehension that each of them felt . The remaining minute passed slowly and Gillon swallowed hard several times . He was aware that he was sweating heavily and he knew that his tightly clenched hands would be shaking badly if he had not shoved them hard into his parka . Each of the six men stared desperately at the open doorway , each conscious of his own fear , none daring to look at his companion , frightened even more of what he might see in the face of the man next to him than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the cabin to check the fuses a final time . A moment later , he returned to the doorway and peered out into the night , then stepped back and tapped Leycock on the shoulder . Without hesitation , Leycock kicked the bundle of packs and duffle bags through the doorway and followed the instant the static line snapped free . Jones was right behind , then Rodek . Stowe made a perfect start , vaulting out to drop feet first . Gillon stepped to the door right behind him , placed both hands on either side of the frame , took a shallow breath of the icy fluid into his lungs and pulled himself out . He had pulled harder with his right arm than with his left and had twisted so that he was looking back at the aircraft . He was aware of the fuselage sliding past as he began to drop , slowly at first , so that he seemed for an instant suspended next to the airplane looking back at Dmietriev , who had just stepped to the , hatch . Then with breathtaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then began the silent flow of cold air past his body and the sensation of falling deserted him until shock of the opening chute snapped him up like a broken pup on a string . He glanced up to see the square canopy opening like black and white flower above his head . Just past the edge of t chute he could see Dmietriev 's chute beginning to billow . Gillon , remembering his first , painful lessons at Fort Bennin caught the harness lines and pulled hard to the left to steady descent . Quickly , the pendulum motion canceled and the chTHE 1iv sHAN 87came under control . He could see the drifting canopies of the others strung out in a curving line , as if they were all sliding clown an invisible cable . The terrain below was all but invisible ; the snow-covered mountains were little more than pale blurs in the starlight and only the faint images of jagged peaks could be discerned around him . Above , the Milky Way wheeled across the sky , presenting itself for inspection in a way that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold air of the high altitude carvedh star from crystal and fixed it to the deepest black velvet . He looked for Dmietriev again and finally spotted him , someousand feet behind and several hundred feet above , his chuteHy opened and the black dot that was the Russian intelligencerative dangling below . Searching back along the way for thecraft , he found that he could not even find the running lights . As Gillon turned his attention back to the ground , a bright flashlight caught his eye , imprinting itself upon his retina . He jerkedand the light to see it flash toward the peaks and for antant he thought it might be a meteorite . Puzzled , and suddenlyrehensive , he swung wide , using the harness straps to turn thete , but whatever it was , it was gone . As he forced his attention back to the imminent landing , he that the flash could only have been the aircraft exploding aturely . It had not lasted long enough to be a flare and too to be a meteorite . And if it was the aircraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area well belowDzungarian Gate , some twenty miles southwest . It surely would reappeared on the Chinese radar screen in the interval before loded and its sudden disappearance would mean that search es would be airlifted into the area immediately . That brought chilling realization that the search parties could be at the kage within hours of dawn. thlessly , he thrust those fears down for another time . If he not concentrate on his landing , it might not make any difcc to him whether the Chinese found the wreckage or not . cir landing area , just west of the bend in the Agiass River , relatively flat , although high , and formed a wide , but short u south of Musart Pass , through which they would reach88 THE CHINESE AGENDAthe interior of the range , There was , he knew , an ancient lamasery less than two miles from their landing site on the northern edge of the plateau that supposedly had been abandoned for nearly one hundred years . They were to wait there for moonrise . A blur of white rushed to meet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxation before the amazingly hard . surface of compacted snow slapped him . He collapsed on impacts and rolled onto his side in the classic landing position that hq had been taught so many years before , surprised that he stilli retained the proper reflexes . He sprawled face downward anthe wind snatched at the chute and dragged him several yards before he managed to turn over onto his back and release th harness . The chute billowed for a moment in the wind , the shorn of its balancing weight , collapsed . Gillon got to his feet , gasping deep breaths in the relativel thick air of the nine-thousand-foot plateau . The air was like liqui nitrogen in its intensity , almost as cold here as it had been a i8,000 feet . After a moment , he caught sight of a tiny pointlight several hundred yards north of his position . He stripped o the chute harness and gathered up the canopy , wrapping it into bundle with the shrouds , and started toward the point of light , own flashlight glowing . Dmietriev had landed not more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with th chute . In less than ten minutes , the six of them had assembly around the pile of packs and duffle bags that Leycock had dragg into the shelter of a rock outcropping . " The aircraft exploded before it should have , " Dmietriev salwithout preamble , speaking in short choppy sentences that btrayed his anger . " Both Sergeant Rodek and I checkedexplosives very carefully . One of the fuses must have been d fective . However , that does not alter the fact that the Chine will be able to find the wreckage now sooner than we h anticipated . I would guess that they will have reached the eras site by midmorning . By midafternoon , it is possible that th will have discovered that the bodies of four Caucasians are mi ing . By nightfall they will be scouring these mountains for eviden that you parachuted to safety . " THE 1u N sHAN 89Jones was half sitting , half kneeling on the pile of equipment , and , as he looked up at them and in the meager light from the torches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he appeared to be . Leycock saw it too and knelt down beside Jones . " How do you feel . . . ? " Jones waved a hand in irritation . " I feel perfectly all right . Stop fussing over me . " He looked down at the snow for a moment before speaking again . " You can bet that when they do come , they wo n't confine their search just to the air . They 'll have ground parties out and in force . " " Damn those fuses ! " Stowe muttered . " All right , Mr. Agency man , you are the fearless leader . Where do we go from here ? " Jones bit back an angry retort and Gillon turned to stare at Stowe . It was a good thing that he was n't running this show , he thought , otherwise Stowe would be off to a very bad start .. . with a set of loose teeth . Jones had apparently decided to ignore the comment , because he looked around in the darkness as if considering . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass until moonrise . And we ca n't stay here without shelter . " As he spoke , the wind stiffened momentarily , as if to remind them of its presence . " I think that we had better stick to the original plan and head up to the lamasery for a few hours . We could all use the time to adapt to the altitude anyway . " Stowe started to say something and Leycock , as if guessing that it would be a smart crack , dug an elbow into Stowe 's ribs to silence him . Stowe grunted in anger , but remained silent . Jones waited for objections and , when there was none , heaved himself to his feet and picked up his pack . " All right , open the duffle bags and pick out your weapons , then bury the chutes  --  nd bags . " The six men looked at one another , realizing the hopelessness of their position before they even began , but knowing that there was nothing else to be done . " Well , " Jones snapped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rodek cut the lashings and dragged the duffle bags out and ped them open . Silently , he handed out the rifles , keeping the90 THE CHINESE AGENDAtwo AK-47s for Dmietriev and himself . Leycock scooped a hole in the glazed snow , broke through the thick ice crust with his knife and in a few moments had dug a pit in which to cram the parachutes and empty bags . Gillon glanced at his watch , noting that it was still set on Rome time . He mentioned it to Jones , who immediately ordered them all to reset to 2130 , local time . They had at least four hours to moonrise and the remaining five to six hours of darkness should be enough to see them over the pass , he calculated . Staring about him at the ghostly pale peaks and the frozen landscape of the plateau , he agreed with Jones ; this was no time to go stumbling about in the dark , risking turned or broken ankles . The surface of the snow had been packed hard enough by the incessant wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upslope , they strapped the carrying cases for the skis down the side of the packs and , with each other 's aid , lashed the snowshoes on the back . Then , roped together to prevent straying only , since the slope was neither rugged nor steep , they started out , Jones in the lead , Gillon following , then Rodek , Stowe , Dmietriev and Leycock . Jones had set an easy pace because of the altitude and the fact that there was no need to hurry . . . as yet . Their landing zone was approximately two miles below and to the north of the lamasery , and within forty minutes its forbidding black bulk was in view , silhouetted against the star field . Jones brought the party to a halt in the shelter of a jumble of boulders and untied the safety line from his waist . With a warning to Gillon to remain where they were , he trotted away to the right and disappeared into the darkness . Again , Gillon found himself impressed with the precautions that Jones was willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand that the Chinese could be waiting in ambush for them , but apparently , those odds were too much for Jones . In view of everything that had gone wrong so far , Gillon felt they were much too high for him as well . The wind was unbelievably cold , blowing nearly thirty miles an hour up the pass and added to the o  --  F temperature , the THE TIEN SHAN 91wind chill gave an equivalent temperature of forty below zero . Dillon was beginning to think that his feet had frozen to the snow in spite of the heavily insulated boots and clothing when Jones reappeared . " All right , " he called , " let 's go in . " They went up the slope quickly , all of them anxious to get out of the fierce wind . Gillon had forgotten how cold , cold could be . Two years in Africa and four years before that in Indochina were not the best way to train for mountain conditions , and he wondered if there was any truth to the old legend that your blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great stone arch that had once surmounted the main gate , Dmietriev shone his torch along what remained of the old wall . The hewn rock glistened with its coating of frost . Gillon went closer to examine the construction with his flashlight and found that no mortar had been used , that the huge blocks of stone had been carved to fit one exactly onto the other . Frost had crumbled away the edges where the blocks met , but each had been fitted so closely that it would have been impossible to insert the thinnest knife blade between any two stones . Mortar would have been valueless , he realized . With the constant expansion and contraction of the rock caused by summer heat and winter cold , it would have crumbled away in a few years . Inside the walls , the squat shape of the lamasery itself loomedveral hundred feet beyond the entrance . It was hard to discerntails in the starlight , but it appeared that the roof had collapsedone side of the building . The compound itself was empty and flat , the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main building and up the long sweep of carved steps to the main doorway , gaping wide like a dead mouth . The doors had long since disappeared and Gillon , estimating the size 10f the doorway to be nearly twenty feet high by thirty feet wided surmounted by a massive carved stone lintel , wondered howy had been carted away . . . or for that matter how theyd been brought here in the first place . Inside , the wind was reduced to a few eddies wending through92 THE CHINESE AGENDAthe doorway and scattering the snow about into meager drifts . Jones took them down the ice-coated main hallway to a smaller room , where even the whine of the wind was lost . " This looks like a good place to wait it out , " Jones said suddenly , startling them all . His voice echoed through the room . The heavy atmosphere failed to lift when Dmietriev lit and fixed a small candle into a metal reflector . The minuscule flame provided just enough light to see by , but at the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flashlight and shone it around at the room walls . They were completely devoid of decoration , in contrast to the usual oriental penchant for intricate and colorful design . Dirt and frost stained the stone walls and piles of debris were scattered here and there across the floor , which was of the same carefully fitted stone construction as the walls . Finding nothing of interest , he returned to the others . Jones had pulled his sleeping bag from his pack and spread it on top of a foam pad . Gillon studied the pinched faces of the others . Already he could see the beginnings of altitude sickness in their blue lips and hollow cheeks . Rodek was moving slowly about the room , fixing his sleeping bag and arranging his backpack and rifle within easy reach . His every movement suggested the start of stomach cramps and lack of energy . Thoughtfully , Gillon dug thfirst-aid kit out of his pack and swallowed three aspirin table with a mouthful of icy water from his canteen . This was preventive technique . . . or his superstition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventing altitude sickness , the mild hypoxia tha resulted from too much exertion at an altitude where the pressur of oxygen in the air was too low to penetrate the arterial walls in the quantities to which the body was accustomed at sea level . It was a common malady in mountain travel and usually passed after a day or so , but its effects , until the body adapted , were a general feeling of languor , nausea , restless sleep and a gasping for breath , all of which combined to make the victim wonder why he ha come in the first place and swear by everything he held sacred never to do so again . His theory was that the aspirin dilated the blood vessels , especially those feeding the brain , and the extra blood/oxygen capacity staved off or reduced the hypoxia . The bestTILE TIEN SHAN 93way to start a hard trip into the mountains was to sleep at altitude , thus allowing the body to begin its process of adjustment under conditions of the least exertion possible . Satisfied that every precaution possible had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the sleep on the trip from Rome and the long day of enforced relaxation at Ala Kul , he quickly fell asleep . Gillon came awake with a start . Jones drew back and motioned for him to lie quiet . A moment later , someone moved across the room and the tiny candle went out , plunging the room into darkness . " Get out there and see if he needs any help , " Jones called in a low voice . Gillon heard the soft sounds of booted feet trotting down the narrow hallway . Almost immediately , Leycock was back . " All right , they are still a long way off . " " Good . Get back out there and stay with Rodek then , " Jones answered . " What 's going on ? " Gillon demanded . " Get up and be ready to move . Rodek spotted something or someone coming this way . " Gillon slid out of the sleeping bag as the candle was relit and slipped his cold boots on . With the ease of long practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into its stuff bag . He zipped his pack closed and lashed the bag to the frame , then picked up his carbine and loaded a cartridge into the chamber and flicked the ' safety catch on . " Ho , boy . The soldier is ready and raring for action . " Stowe 's voice was sarcastic . " Shut up . Get your own stuff together and get out into the court-d . " Jones toured the room quickly , checking to see that nothing left behind that would betray them . " All right . Let 's get out there and see what the hell is going on . " The almost full moon was just pushing its way past a long ridge the east , and through the main gate the snow gleamed in the e flood . The growing moonlight had washed away the shadows94 THE CHINESE AGENDAthat gave substance to the rubble-strewn yard and left a smooth , glistening sheet that stretched to the walls . The three men crossed the courtyard quickly to the base of the wall , where the rubble of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful not to thrust a foot through the thin crust of snow into the rocks beneath . The monastery appeared to have been constructed as much for defense as for prayer . The walls were massive ; huge blocks of stone piled fifteen feet or more high and ten feet thick , each carved from the granite of the mountain . They reached the top of the wall and went up slowly to the battlements to where Leycock and Rodek were leaning against an abattoir that jutted abruptly above the level of the wall . Both were staring off to the northeast through binoculars . Jones called out and , startled , Rodek swung around with his carbine ready , then lowered it and waved a hand as he recognized them . Gillon walked along the wall to where Leycock waited , and accepted the proffered glasses . At first glance , the pass below was empty of all but wind and snow . The moon , now well clear of the ridge , flooded the snow-covered terrain with a harsh white light that provided better visibility than he had expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there , below that pinnacle . " Gillon shifted the glasses until he caught a flicker of movement in the shadows beneath the towering rock spire . A moment later , a line of men and animals emerged into the moonlight . " My God , " he exclaimed . " There must be a hundred people in that . . . that . . . what in hell are they ? " " Some kind of caravan , I guess . " Leycock answered . " I thought caravans had disappeared years ago . " " Apparently not , " Gillon muttered . " Are you sure they are n't Chinese soldiers ? " Leycock shrugged . " As far as I can see , they do n't look like soldiers . And if they were , why would they be traveling with camels ? " " But , " Gillon countered with a question of his own , " if they are n't soldiers , why are they traveling at night ? " THE TIEN SHAN 95 " That 's what 's got me worrying , " Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillon pointed out the location and Jones spent several long minutes studying the distant figures . " Damn , " he said finally . Dmietriev questioned Rodek in Russian and Gillon half listened as he used his own glasses now to watch the caravan . Rodek pro-tested and Dmietriev spoke again , more forcefully this time , and still Rodek disagreed . Finally Dmietriev shrugged and borrowed Cillon 's glasses . After a moment , he nodded to Rodek . " What is it ? " Stowe demanded . " Sergeant Rodek thinks that the caravan is composed of nomads , probably from somewhere in the Dzungarian region or perhaps ( torn further east in Inner Mongolia . " " Nomads , " Stowe snorted . " You mean like Tartars and Mongols ? Nonsense ... " " Not Tartars , " Dmietriev interrupted . " Probably Mongols of some kind . There are a few of the ancient Khanates left that still use the caravan trails . That is the reason for this monastery . Why else do you suppose it was built in the middle of nowhere ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stowe shrugged . " How the hell should I know ? You 're supposed to provide the local color . " " Are you saying then , " Jones interjected , " that these people areveling some kind of caravan route and are not out looking for us ? " " I do not see how they could be searching for us already . Cerbinly there would have been no time to bring that many men and animals into these mountains . I doubt very much that they haveen heard of us . I do not know a great deal about caravans , but ituld seem to me to be very early in the season for them to beveling and very late at night as well . I would guess that they arerting early to be as far ahead of the other caravans as possible. bably , the authorities do not even know they are on the trail . " The six of them were silent for a moment . Jones 's face was , for a short time , a study in indecision . Then , abruptly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell out of here , no matter who they are . tick , you and Andre go down and smooth out the tracks we96 THE CHINESE AGENDAleft in the courtyard as much as you can . Mike , check outside and do the same thing . " Stowe nodded and Dmietriev and Leycock followed him down the steps . Jones glanced at Rodek and casually stepped around so that his back was to the Russian . Rodek ignored them and went back to the wall to watch the caravan . " I do n't know who this traveling menagerie is , but it seems mighty damned coincidental to me that they show up now . It could be that Dmietriev is right and they are just trying to get the jump on the competition , but I still think it 's better that we get out of here and the faster the better . " " Yeah , " Gillon nodded . " I do n't like the idea that they are still traveling this late at night . " He went back to the wall and studied the caravan once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the grossest details , but that was sufficient to show the strength of the approaching party . The entire scene was right out of The Arabian Nights , he decided . Large , swaying camels plodded along under heavy bur-dens paced by men muffled and swathed in greatcoats against the bitter chill . They came steadily on and without a doubt now , the monastery was their destination . " Come on , let 's go , " Jones muttered , and started for the steps . Rodek followed and Gillon put his glasses away and started after them . " I just thought of something else , too , " Gillon called after Jones . " If they are going to stop here , they may be crossing the pass .. . hell , they will be crossing the pass . We could have them dogging our trail for the next couple of days . " Jones nodded and kept on . " Yeah , you could be right . We 'll just have to be extra damned careful , then . " Gillon followed Rodek down the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew less about him than about any of the others . He had had a chance to observe Jones , Leycock and Stowe on the long flight from Rome . . . al-though he had to admit that most of what he knew about their backgrounds had come from Jones . About Dmietriev , he knew little more than that he was an excellent shot , fast as a striking1THE TIEN SHAN 97snake , and a good actor , all of which he would have expected from a Soviet intelligence field agent , or any nation 's field agent for that matter . But Rodek was a blank . The fact that he spoke , or pre-tended to speak no English led him to think that the Soviets were still playing their own game . Until Rodek decided to break his zombi-like silence , there was little more that he could learn about him . Dmietriev and Stowe were waiting for them and they trudged through the gateway , where Leycock joined them . They had fashioned drags using their packs and they pulled these along behind to obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the south until the monastery was between them and the approaching caravan . He stopped here and , using his flashlight , unfolded the map and knelt down in the snow while the others gathered around . He traced out the route to the rendezvous . The way that had been marked would take them across the plateau to skirt Isskgal Glacier and then three miles southwest to Musart Pass at 11,48o feet . That meant a climb of nearly four thousand feet in less than three miles . Jones wanted to clear the pass before sunrise if possible and make camp on the far side for the day . They would then trek down through the trees after nightfall to about ten thousand feet , bypass the Jiparleth Glacier and into the heavy forest the second day to be in position for the rendezvous at dawn on the third day . There was a heated discussion as to the wisdom of following the marked route . Stowe objected on the grounds that as the Chinese had been able to discover the existence of the mission , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He argued hard for an alternate route that would take them northeast , even farther away from the suspected crash site and down through a low valley in a lengthy circuitous route that would add fifteen miles to the march . Jones finally cut the discussion off by getting to his feet and picking up his pack and carbine . " If nothing else , the Chinese wo n't know the route . I laid it out while the rest of you were sleeping . Also , " he continued , " these winds will wipe out any tracks in a few hours . " But Stowe was98 THE CHINESE AGENDAunconvinced and continued to press for the circular route to the northeast , claiming that the safest approach lay from the opposite direction . When Jones refused angrily , pointing out that they lacked the time to make the longer trek , Stowe stamped off to gather up his pack without another word . Because of the winds that swept up the pass throughout the long winter , the frozen snow was packed to the consistency of sand and neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ground-covering pace across the plateau and as the terrain shelved up , switched to alternating the rest step with trail stride every five minutes . By 0500 , the top of the pass was in sight although still a thou-sand feet above them and dawn was an hour and a half away . The wind , as it swept out of the Arctic and down across the vast Russian steppes for hundreds of miles to the mountain barrier of the Tien Shan , where it was compressed as it forced its way through the high passes , was , luckily , behind them and tended to help rather than hinder their progress . The same wind blew incessantly , rarely varying more than a few miles an hour from its average speed of twenty knots . But vicious storms were common throughout the long winter and then the wind speed might exceed eighty miles an hour . For now , it blew steadily against their backs , urging them on while at the same time chilling each man to the bone in spite of their protective clothing . To keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezing to death when out of the shelter of trees or tents . In spite of the compression that raised the wind 's temperature as it blew up through the passes , the equivalent temperature , combining ambient temperature and wind speed , was still well below o  --  F.Musart Pass was typical of the high Tien Shan . A wide pass , it was some three miles from side to side at the base . The approach from the northwestern slopes was exceedingly steep , almost four-teen hundred feet per mile . Halfway up the slope , it looked to Cillon , seeing it for the first time in the strong moonlight , as if it were a spillway into a vast bowl and he was trapped on the underside , struggling to reach the rim . High ridges of stone lined the approaches on either side , butTILE TIEN SHAN 99even though some of them reared a thousand feet above the floor of the pass , they were dwarfed into insignificance by the immensity of the mountains around them . The way was smooth and the snow level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The terrain under the snow would be a coarse gravel , he knew , and there was no possibility that any living thing , plant or animal , could survive the continual winds . And in spite of its being hard-packed , a sudden spurt of wind could still whirl icy streamers from the surface that eroded the exposed skin like a sand-blaster . Without snow masks and goggles they would have risked blindness . For one eternal hour they plodded upward , strung out like bugs a string , their trail stride having completely given way to the t step . At eleven thousand feet Jones called a brief halt andey huddled together as best they could to escape the incessant , searching of the wind . To talk was impossible and they squatted hind their packs like exhausted animals , breathing heavily into oved hands . Gillon felt as if his lungs were constricted by a steel d that tightened with each successive step until it seemed as if ribs would collapse . His back and legs were weak with tension d fatigue and it required a conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of the aspirins , nausea tore his stomach and every now and then he would be jerked to a t as one of the men behind him paused to retch and vomit . ch time , Gillon signaled Jones by yanking the line and Jones pped to wait impatiently for the second tug from Gillon thated him forward again like a machine . Only one other time in long hours of steady climbing did Jones pause to rest . Insantly , he pulled them forward by his own sheer determination . For a long time , the top of the pass seemed to come no nearerGillon was reduced to the old climber 's trick of forbidding self to look at the crest again . He concentrated his whole being shifting first one leg forward , pause , then shift the other againd once again in the incessant , maddening rest step that conues to carry you forward long after you would have sworn t you had no strength left at all . His back and hips were on from the weight of the pack , and the carbine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his right shoulder until it was all he could do to keep from throwing it away . Then the thirst , the terrible thirst of high-altitude exertion , began to make itself felt . At these altitudes and in winter the humidity is close to nonexistent . The continual gasping for breath exposes the membranes of the mouth to the air , which greedily extracts their moisture . That , coupled with intense exertion , dehydrates the body quickly and it becomes impossible to force water into tissues in sufficient quantites to replace that lost to the air . Intense exertion at high altitudes then becomes a race against fatigue and dehydration , complicated by lack of oxygen for starved body tissue . The darkness in those places shadowed from the moon , drifted away into a grayish sea that obscured the ridges on either side of the pass . Gillon gradually became aware that the slope had changed and when , forgetting his promise not to look up , he raised his eyes , he saw that the endless expanse of white was no longer above them but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dark rock below . He glanced back over his shoulder and , in the gathering light could see the straggling figures of the others strung out behind on the line . Their movements as they staggered up the killing slope were reminiscent of dangling fish . Jones had stopped . Gillon closed the twenty-foot gap between them and they both sank down in the snow breathing heavily , and waited for the others to come up . For several minutes there was only the wind and the sound of their gasping before Dmietriey trudged up and collapsed beside them . " Downslope . . . three miles . . . or more , " he rasped finally " trees begin . " Jones nodded but said nothing , rubbing his forehead as Rod and Leycock straggled in . It was too cold to rest for long . Gillon watched as Jones got to his feet . They were all staggerin but Jones more so than the rest of them . That blow must hav been more severe than they had suspected , Gillon thought , and Leycock caught his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of them could do for him and they both knew it . As they started forward again , Gillon detached himself from th1V safety line . The others did likewise and he coiled the rope , tiedTHE TIEN SHAN 101it off and slung the bight over the upright portion of his pack frame . He watched the others file past , then turned to examine the pass and the high ridges on either side . The top of the nearly **25;14488;TOOLONG pass was no more than a few hundred yards wide . Looking back down the way they had come , he was even more impressed by the fan shape of the pass , resembling nothing so much as the spillway of a millrace . The two ridges that had paced their climb closed in around the top of the pass , broken only by a quarter-mile-wide gap at the top  --  the pass itself , The ridge to the right fell away to the west while that on the left loomed above the point where they stood . Overhanging its lip was a huge brow of snow , undercut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been invisible from below and Gillon was grateful for that . He would have had serious doubts about ascending the pass with the wind blowing as hard as it was and that massive pile of snow hanging above their heads like the sword of Damocles . The whole area had obviously been carved by a massive glacier creeping slowly down from the north , eons ago . Gillon tried to imagine the immense tongeof ice that it would have required to fill the thousands of feetd cubic miles of mountain valleys and ridges until it finally over-'lapped this ridge , cut its way through the solid rock and carvedt this pass before spilling over into the interior of the Tien Shan. was beyond comprehension and , shaking his head , he startedwn after the others . The snow on the south side of the pass was not packed , as thed was less intense on this side . As they proceeded down unlationsof the gentler slope , the snow deepened until they wereowing up to their knees . Jones brought them to a halt and theynned snowshoes . From there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy forest at eight thousand feetre sure to be completed by dawn . A few minutes later , the oldMar lacing pain began to grow inside his thighs , arcing over ton beneath his crotch , as the unnatural , wide-legged stance forcedthe snowshoes dragged at his unaccustomed muscles . Withinhour , Gillon knew the pain would be unbearable ; every stepwould be a grinding , stabbing pain until the muscles grew numbwith tension . And by nightfall , the pain would begin again as the102 THE CHINESE AGENDAcold cramped his legs . Gritting his teeth , he ignored the pain and struggled on . As they trudged down the slope , the light grew apace until short of the tree line , the first rays of the sun could be seen above the peaks to the east . Gillon glanced around . He had been dragging his parka , weighted with the ski pack , in an effort to wipe away any tracks . The drag was doing its job and the steady wind would finish it . There would be nothing for low-flying search aircraft to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clear blue as the cloud cover began to break up , when Jones led them into the first of the pines , scrubby spruce that indicated they were below ten thousand feet once more . Gillon slapped the snow from his parka and halted long enough to slip back into it , retie the ski pack , then hurried on to catch up . The trees , sparse as yet and low growing , barely reached above his head but they would serve to hide signs of their passage . They trudged on for another hour while the forest thickened and rose about them . As they marched on , Gillon noticed that the snow was becoming deeper and deeper and the saucer-like depressions around the tree trunks were more pronounced as they moved toward nine thousand feet , where the differential between day- and nighttime temperatures was great enough to allow intermittent thawing and freezing . They crossed one wide expanse of open slope , hurriedly , half sliding , half running on their snow-shoes . There were no egg-carton marks as yet  --  hollows carved into the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced . Jones brought them to a halt at 0900 hours , well inside a thick stand of towering spruce that closed in overhead to obscure any sign of the sky . The slope widened to an almost horizontal ledge at this point , then dropped sharply downslope for a hundred feet . There would almost certainly be a stream , frozen long since and covered with snow at the foot of the bluff . The trees were thick-holed , shooting as straight as shipmasts for eighty feet to one hundred feet . Virgin timber , Gillon suspected ; natural selection had spread them widely in their contest for sunlight , and the under-brush , buried under several feet of snow , provided the site thatTHE TI EN SHAN 103Jones had chosen with a feeling of total silence , almost cathedral-like in nature . Except for the monotonous wind , there was not a sound to be heard in the immensity of the forest . Gillon stared off across the open space cut by the buried stream to see nothing but more trees forming a seemingly impregnable barrier a hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a hundred yards upstream to form a convenient crossing point . Jones called to him and Gillon walked back through the trees . He had been less than twenty feet away , but so thick was the forest that the others were invisible and the sounds they made in setting up the small camp were completely obscured by the peculiar muffling quality of trees . He thought , as he walked through the forest , of his almost superstitious love of trees ; the feeling that among these giants , he was safe and could depend upon them for concealment and protection . Jones was sitting on his pack , the map spread in front of him on the snow , while the others stood about waiting . He glanced up us Gillon joined the circle . " This looks to me to be a good place to spend the day , " he began without preamble . " We 'll start again at zioo . . . that 'll give us about two hours of travel before we need to stop and eat . We 'll sleep during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be there . Also , if that damned caravan is still behind us , the jog to the east tonight will take us well out of their line of march . These trees are thicker than I thought but if the rest of you are as ushed as I am , we could stand the rest . " Dmietriev nodded , indicating that Jones 's plan made sense to m . " I am afraid that the Chinese will be out after us in force . I think c need to put a guard at the top of the pass . . . anyone coming tip the pass can be seen for miles and that should give time for the guard to ski down to warn us . " Gillon grunted acknowledgment and Jones nodded . " Good idea . Any volunteers ? " Rodek stepped forward without hesitation and as Gillon started to get up , Leycock pushed past him . " Rodek and I 'll go . My skiing is pretty good . How about his ? "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
