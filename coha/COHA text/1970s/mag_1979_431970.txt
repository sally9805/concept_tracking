 | Julie was a junior in a small Illinois high school when her world collapsed around her . Within a few months , her parents were divorced , the boy she thought she was going to marry moved away and a favorite teacher suddenly had no time for her . That teacher found Julie , long after school hours , dead at her desk , an empty bottle of sleeping pills lying on the floor next to her foot . Phil and Sarah , both high school seniors in New Hampshire , wanted desperately to get married . But Sarah 's parents opposed the union so adamantly they relocated the entire family to a faraway city to break up the relationship . Phil and Sarah were found dead in each other 's arms in his car . A hose carrying carbon monoxide had been jammed through a crack in the window . Julie , Phil and Sarah were n't reached in time . Young Melanie was ? even though right up to the last moment her parents were blind to the depth of her despair . Melanie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake her that bright sunny June morning when Melanie was graduating from high school . Lois made a pot of coffee and took a few minutes to savor memories of her little girl . For 16 of her 17 years , Melanie had lived up to her mother 's ideal of the perfect child . It was during her third year in high school that Melanie seemed to change . She withdrew from school activities , stopped accepting invitations to parties , did n't seem to care when her grades dropped from A 's to C 's . She spent much time alone in her room , listening to records or just staring at the walls . At meals , she kept silent until her parents gently questioned her about her behavior . Then she got angry and stomped away from the table . When they suggested she see a doctor , she shouted , " Leave me alone . There 's nothing wrong . " Then Melanie 's black moods had departed as suddenly as they 'd arrived . In recent months , she 'd been quiet , but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely relieved . Now , on graduation morning , Lois poked her head into Melanie 's room and called softly to awaken her daughter . When Melanie did n't answer , Lois ' eyes traveled to the nightstand where she saw a bottle of her tranquilizers . What was the bottle doing in here ? Then she spotted the note next to the bottle . A sudden wave of nausea hit Lois . She picked up the piece of pale blue paper : " Dear Mom and Dad ... I 'm sorry . . . did n't mean to cause . . . just too hard .. not your fault . . . you expected so much . . . . " Frantically , Lois examined the bottle . It had been more than half full . Now it was empty . She screamed . Melanie survived . Today she finding help from a psychologist she likes and from a family shocked into awareness of their daughter 's inner turmoil . But only a few desperate minutes kept Melanie from becoming yet another statistic in what professionals now call a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.000 teens and young adults in this country ? many from " average ' families ? took their own lives . That is three times as many as 20 years ago ? an increase that far outstrips suicides in any other age group . ( Only accidents claim more young lives . ) Even those shocking figures may be conservative . Some of  | the experts say there are two to three suicides for every one recorded , because many fatal accidents are " subintentioned " suicides in which an angry or depressed teenager takes lifethreatening risks . In addition , family doctors sometimes obscure the cause of death to spare families from shame . What 's more , the actual suicides represent only the tip of a huge iceberg of emotional distress , because an estimated 400,000 young people make " unsuccessful " attempts to die every year . What desperate message are these tragic young people trying to send us ? Dr. Michael Peck , co-director of the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center , says , " The vast majority of youngsters who attempt , threaten , or commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape from an unhappy life . " Why , in recent years , have a growing number of our youth seen suicide as the only answer ? " There has been a definite weakening of family standards and parental authority , " says Dr. Joseph Teicher , director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the Los Angeles County- University of Southern California Medical Center . " There are more and more divorces . And more children are physically or emotionally abandoned at an early age by parents who are so troubled themselves they can not give that vital life fluid we call nurturance . " Related to the breakdown of family ties is the emphasis on " doing your own thing . " " We have become very egocentric and competitive ? even with our own children , " points out Cleveland psychiatrist Dr. Victor Victoroff . " Our old traditional resources ? family , church , schools , government ? are seen cynically as untruthful and untrustworthy . So , in a world where mom and dad are both working , and grandparents are off living the good life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help a troubled teenager ? " Then there 's the way we tend to shy away from long-range goals today as , more and more , we live only for the moment . Thus , teenagers have less sense of purpose as they reach adulthood . " If a youngster is n't happy now , " suggests Dr. Teicher , " he or she may see death as the only solution to the chronic problem of living . " All our young people have grown up in these difficult times . But not all think of suicide as a logical solution . What separates the teens who can handle themselves in today 's society from those who ca n't ? According to most experts , the young people who commit or attempt suicide have experienced more than the average number of " upsets " in their short lifetimes . They 've had to put up with more divorces and remarriages in their immediate family ; more illnesses or deaths ( including other suicides ) ; more run-ins with the law : more family moves with close friends left behind . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from meaningful relationships . And it 's these important relationships that anchor us to life . A teenager named Bobby provides painful illustration of a child who lost so much he thought he had nothing left to lose . He was only six when his grandmother died . Because both his parents worked , Nana had always taken care of him . She was the one the little boy turned to when he had a new discovery or when he was hurt . At her death , her closeness was never replaced for Bobby .  | His parents worked very hard and had little energy to devote to him . They saw themselves as " losers " and desperately wanted their son to succeed . For years , Bobby struggled to do that for them . Although his aptitude tests showed he had only average intelligence , his grades were very high . He was the best first baseman on his Little League team , even though his father rarely had time to watch him play . By the time Bobby reached his teens , his father was drinking heavily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with short outbursts of anger . Bobby was usually caught in the middle . In his senior year , Bobby 's grades slipped and he failed to make the firststring baseball team . Then Sandra ? his only real friend ? told him she no longer wanted to go steady . Bobby sank deeper and deeper into despondency . He could n't talk to anyone about how he felt . To do so would mean he was a failure . He 'd do anything ? anything ? not to let the world discover that secret . So , late one night when his parents were asleep , Bobby climbed on a chair , threw a rope around the bar on which he did his 100 daily chin-ups and hanged himself . " We gave him everything we could , " his father said , defensively . " What more did he want ? " It is n't unusual for loving , wellmeaning parents to encourage a child to " make something of himself . " But Bobby 's folks may have pushed too hard ? and for self-serving reasons . Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , points out , " Some parents need their children to achieve to make up for their feelings of inadequacy . " Bobby 's situation also fits the " profile " of the suicidal youngster in other ways . He had an alcoholic parent . Conflict was a normal state of affairs in his home . He 'd just lost a girlfriend . " It 's very common for a love affair gone sour or other major disappointments to precede a suicidal gesture , " says Dr. Teicher . " But it 's a mistake to believe that that 's the cause of selfdestruction . For most young people , it 's only the last straw . " More boys than girls take their own lives . But girls are two to three times more likely to attempt suicide . ( Boys tend to choose violent methods of self-destruction from which there is little opportunity to turn back ? guns , jumping from heights , hanging . Girls use passive methods , like pills . ) Experts agree that it 's more acceptable for girls to show emotion and ask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't really want to do this , but 1 want you to know how desperate I am . " But recently there has been a disturbing trend . " I have been seeing a new level of despondency among girls , " says Dr. Victoroff . " More are now selecting methods of no return ? like jumping and stabbing themselves through the heart . " Why this new despondency in our daughters ? Aside from the normal pressures faced by teens , there are now additional stresses on girls . " This is a transitional time for young women , " says Dr. Victoroff . " More than ever before they 're being encouraged to move into high-pressure careers and to be more sexually liberated . Drug use and drinking seem more acceptable . Yet , at the same time , they still hear more traditional messages from their parents . The pull on young girls is enormous . " Many parents wonder about the roles of drugs and alcohol in the skyrocketing adolescent suicide rate . Dr.  | Teicher says , " There is n't a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on the rise . " Some experts contend that young suicides actually use drugs less often than other youngsters . " In fact , " points out Dr. Seiden , " the absence of drug use may be another reflection of the way these kids are cut off from the experiences common to other young people . " Other authorities , however . regard alcohol and drug use as a cry for help . According to Dr. Calvin Frederick . chief of the National Institute of Mental Health 's division of disaster and emergency mental health , very depressed youngsters have many ways of letting parents know how they feel . One teenager may have anxiety attacks . Another may be tired all the time , have no appetite , not sleep , lose weight . Depression may cause a falling off in grades . Withdrawal from friendships may also be a sign . Sometimes a series of " accidents " may be a warning . Parents often assume that such behavior is just a normal part of the stormy adolescent years . Frequently it is . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time or are uncharacteristic of the individual . then notice must be taken . If you think your child is in pain . do n't waste precious time trying to figure out what went wrong ? or blaming yourself . Instead , focus on the mans ways you can help . Dr. Frederick has some basic guidelines : Ask such questions as : " What 's bothering you lately ? You do n't seer to be yourself . " Do n't be afraid to ask if the young person has ever thought about harming himself or herself . It 's unlikely that mentioning suicide to depressed person will put the idea into his or her head . On the contrary . broaching the subject may allow your child to open up and talk about distressing problems . A youngster who hints at suicide may be giving us a chance to keep him alive . Take seriously all suicide threats . Never dismiss them with , " You do n't really mean that , " or " Your problems are n't all that serious . ' Do n't try to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " Time heals all wounds . " Young people do n't believe it . Never try to shock a child out of suicide . Saying , " Go ahead and do it if you feel you have to , " becomes a challenge that a distressed and rebellious teen may have to meet . But all the love you have may not be enough , by itself , to help your child Do n't be afraid to seek professional  | help . Your family doctor , clergyman , a favorite teacher or school counselor may be able to help or to refer you to someone who can . Most cities and counties have mental health agencies which offer assistance at fees structured to a family 's income . If a young person seems to be in immediate danger of harming himself , short-term hospitalization may be the answer . " Often the suicidal teen has lost all sense of attachment to the world , " says Dr. Teicher . The time in the hospital helps reestablish bonds with caring people . " There are over 200 suicide-prevention and crisis-intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by concerned volunteers trained to handle emergencies over the phone . Most of these services refer teens and families to agencies that provide face-to-face treatment . For more than two years , Dr. Victoroff , chief of psychiatry at Cleveland 's Huron Road Hospital , has gone directly to schools . " 1 show slides of teens who 've killed themselves by lacerating their wrists , stabbing , hanging or shooting themselves , " he says . " 1 let them see the effects of chemical burns in the mouth and stomach . " I tell them what happens in the emergency room when an attempted suicide is brought in . I show them the naso-gastric tubes used to flush out the stomach , the suture kits used to sew up wounds , the tracheotomy sets to create an alternate airway if they 've tried poison or strangling . " My demonstrations are tremendously disturbing . But is n't it better to deal with the horror of guns , knives and poison before the fact rather than after it ? " Every time Dr. Victoroff speaks , he gets dozens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the open . Parents and teachers tell him that , for the first time , their children and students are asking for help . One 16-year-old girl wrote in a poignant letter that she had recently thought seriously of suicide , but she could n't talk to her parents : " I did n't really want to die . I just wanted to end the pain and start over . Maybe if parents and kids were kinder to each other . if teachers were more understanding , if we did n't feel so much competition with one another , if our minds were n't so open to sex and closed to true relationships , we would all be better off . " Surely the single most important thing that parents can do is to listen ? listen hard ? to what our children are saying and trying to say . If we hear them , perhaps they wo n't hurt themselves .
