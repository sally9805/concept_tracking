PEPPERMINT SODA <P> Directed and Written by Diane Kurys <P> What if Little Nell does n't die ? What if nothing much happens to her ? Nell had better be unusually charming , that 's what . The feeling here is that Peppermint Soda , a film about an uneventful year in the life of two young Parisian sisters , wavers back and forth across an awkward boundary : sometimes it is just barely charming enough , and sometimes it almost charms , but not quite . <P> The artistic risk taken by French Director Diane Kurys in this her first film is large . She wants to break free of the artificiality of plot , the storyteller 's hokum in which the revelation of character is only incidental to the tedious march of exposition , complication , resolution . Director Jean-Charles Tacchella 's likable Cousin . Cousine managed this difficult trick ; it simply showed two ordinary but agreeable people falling in love and taking delight in each other , utterly without benefit of story . Kurys tries for the same artful simplicity . She introduces an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her more worldly and matter-of-fact sister Frdrique ( Odile Michel ) , who is 15 . The director merely ob serves their small adventures as they grow a year older . Anne , a bit disdainful , watches Frdrique conduct a flirtation at the seashore ; the two of them endure the strictures of a frightful day school ; they cope with their mother ( Anouk Ferjac ) , and she with them ; Anne meets a boy at a dance ; the school year ends and they return to the beach . That is nearly all that happens . <P> The year that passed in this quiet way was 1963 , though it might easily have been another ; the great events of that year did not mark the girls . But in 1963 Director Kurys was 13 , Anne 's age . She has dedicated the film " to my sister , who still has not returned my orange sweater . " Obviously the commonplace events of the film have an intense and personal meaning for her . Some of this intensity is conveyed to the viewer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strong , often mysterious flow that when it is finished , we call a life . Yet in the end the viewer feels that Kurys has held back important information , that she has used technique to disguise the fact that there are depths to her characters that she herself , perhaps , does not understand . <P> - John Skow
