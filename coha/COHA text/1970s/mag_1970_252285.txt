Tennessee Williams has always made three demands : On himself , to give poetic lie to Nietzsche 's dictum that tragedy is dead . On his audiences , to see through his melodramatics to the philosophical skeleton . On his adapters , to preserve the illumination as well as the heat of his intense personal vision . <P> On all counts , the Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots fails . The Seven Descents of Myrtle , on which it is based , was one of Williams ' most unprepossessing works . Audiences found it difficult " or impossible " to sit through , and it had a Broadway run of less than a month . Still , the movie is not so much a version as a perversion . <P> The fault is partly in the cumbrous plot . After a TV giveaway marriage , Myrtle ( Lynn Redgrave ) and Jeb ( James Coburn ) find themselves hostile strangers . Winded , impotent , pulling marijuana smoke into a cancerous lung , Jeb courts death instead of his bride . In a Louisiana mansion as corroded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Robert Hooks ) . From the newlyweds ' point of view , Chicken has several drawbacks : he is surly , he is vengeful and he is black " " a mistake " claims Jeb , " of my father 's . " Like two halves of the same soul , the siblings are rivals for the property and the woman , while outside a summer flood seems to threaten all creation . At last Chicken exhumes the ultimate family skeleton , and Jeb , the levee and the film simultaneously collapse . <P> Under Sidney Lumet 's flashbackward direction , the acting proves a match for Gore Vidal 's hysteroid script . Coburn emotes in a style that was once the exclusive province of Popeye . Lynn Redgrave , tricked out in a miniskirted bridal gown , looks rather appealingly like a marshmallow on toothpicks . But her accent , a mixture of two Birminghams " Alabama 's and England 's " must be heard to be disbelieved . Even Hooks " normally a powerful and discreet actor " is lost in this raucous mAcnagerie A trois . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrain of failure . But it has been the noble failure of the human spirit . The real tragedy of the Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots is that its failure comes not from the text , flawed as it is , but from the ignoble adaptation .
