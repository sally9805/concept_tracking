The Carter Administration tries a new tack on its sales package <P> I 'm getting some danger signals , " Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd told President Carter . House Speaker Thomas ( " Tip " ) O'Neill had a similar feeling . On behalf of their Capitol constituencies , both men advised the President last week of widespread congressional opposition to Carter 's proposal to sell U.S.-made jet fighters to Israel , Egypt and Saudi Arabia . No one objected to the sale of 15 F-15s and 75 F-16s to Israel and few were worried about Egypt 's purchase of 50 less sophisticated F-5Es . But a number of Senators and Congressmen , many of them under pressure from the Israeli lobby , were dead set against allowing Saudi Arabia to buy 60 F-15s ( seebox ) . <P> In addition , many legislators objected to Carter 's strategy of submitting the three sales proposals to Congress as a package deal . The President hoped to get congressional approval for all three sales-or , if necessary , to end up with no sales at all . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Idaho Democrat who will be the next chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , complained to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance that the " linking " of the three items " violates the intent and spirit of congressional review procedure . " <P> Mindful of that sentiment , both Byrd and O'Neill urged Carter to delay presenting the package to Congress . The President at first seemed adamant . At his midweek press conference he warned that if Congress rejected part of the package , then " my intent is to withdraw the sales proposal altogether . " His reasoning , as Press Secretary Jody Powell explained later , was that if commitments to both sides were not honored , U.S. standing in the Middle East would be damaged . <P> At week 's end , however , the Administration appeared to change its tactics , while standing firm on what it wanted to achieve . Secretary Vance insisted that the White House was " not attempting to place conditions on the scope of the congressional review or the action by Congress . " He reiterated Carter 's press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Congress individually-but simultaneously . If any of the three sales was disapproved , the President would still be in a position to cancel the others . <P> Both the jittery mood of Congress and the Administration 's recognition that some concession to its feelings was necessary reflected the fact that a lot of lobbying was going on . Except for a few full-page newspaper ads by Jewish organizations , however , much of that activity was characteristically invisible , the spontaneous reaction of many of the 5.8 million Jews in the U.S. " There has been a tremendous outpouring of mail , " says one congressional staffer . " But no one has to tell concerned Jews to write to their Congressman . When they see an issue that is dangerous to Israel , they respond . " Similarly , he notes , " you do n't have to call up a Senator to tell him the Jews do n't like the U.S. selling planes to the Saudis . He knows it already . "                @ @ @ @ @
