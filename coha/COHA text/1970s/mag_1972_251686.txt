GETTING away , " Richard Nixon said last week , " gives a sense of perspective which is very , very useful . " The experience was less than bucolic for the 77 reporters and cameramen who traipsed to Camp David to cover the presidential Cabinet shuffles . Camp David 's grounds are off limits to the press , who were herded by Marine guards and concertina wire into a sapling-fenced enclosure called " the duckblind " or farther away in an overcrowded press trailer . After newspapers published pictures similar to this one of reporters shivering under a plastic sheet in a chilly rain to phone in their stories , a press aide had more telephones installed in the trailer . Still , there were no chairs , no coffee or doughnuts or cigarettes to be purchased on Nixon 's mountain , no Western Union lines for filing stories . As the Wall Street Journal remarked : " There must be a better way for the President and his people to keep an eye on each other than through the perspective of a duckblind.
