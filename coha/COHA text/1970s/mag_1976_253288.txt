It 's a goddam good game , " says Yankee President Gabe Paul , " to survive what 's been done to it . " <P> What is being done to baseball and by whom is a matter of substantial contention , but the first half of Gabe Paul 's statement has been resoundingly endorsed in the past few days . <P> &gt; In New York , hallowed old Yankee Stadium , the house that Ruth built , reopened in plushly refurbished form , its dedication presided over by Mayor Abraham Beame . It was 53 years from Babe to Abe , but the difference in what a community will lavish on its sports team could be measured in lightyears . Trembling at the thought that its Yankees might leave town forever , the stone-broke metropolis ponied up an estimated $100 million to provide the likes of 6,900 parking spaces and an electronic Scoreboard for the fans , expansive lavender-carpeted dressing rooms for the players and a plush lounge , featuring overstuffed chairs in the shape of fielders ' gloves , for the owner 's guests . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 76 ) , dressed as a Revolutionary soldier and playing a fife , stumped triumphantly across the 100% natural turf he has restored to Comiskey Park . Marching to Veeck 's tune were White Sox fans in unheard-of numbers . There were 40,318 in the flesh at opening day ( compared with 20,202 last year ) , season-ticket sales were up more than 40% , and a franchise that had been ready as late as December 1975 to blow the Windy City looked solid as a line-drive double-all because the greatest promoter baseball has ever known was back in action . <P> &gt; In Atlanta , the Braves ' new owner , a tough-minded , salty-tongued communications czar and yachtsman named Ted Turner , signed up the game 's most sought-after right arm in a reported $1 million deal engineered by-of all people-a fan who took the negotiating authority upon himself . With one stroke of the pen , the moribund Braves had a bright new look . The signee was a handsome , 30-year-old , bubble-gum-chewing pitcher named Andy Messersmith , a free spirit and free agent whose victorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reshaping the entire sport . <P> Little wonder then that turnstiles clicked like Castanets as combined major league opening-day attendance figures hit an alltime high . Baseball ' 76 , which for weeks had seemed unlikely to get launched at all , was off to a rocketing start . The long legal arguments over the rights of spring , at least for the moment , proved no contest for the game 's own rites of spring . <P> The grandest new blossom of baseball 's most stimulating April ever was Yankee Stadium , a glowing renovation of the most famous , nostalgia-imbued house of sweat in America . Only New Orleans ' Superdome , completed last year , cost more ( $173 million ) ; Seattle 's " Kingdome , " which opened this month , was a mere $60 million . Of course , teams domiciled in these weatherproof bubbles never have to worry about slipping in the rain , losing fly balls in the smog , getting grass stains on their pants or suffering other terrestrial indignities.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
