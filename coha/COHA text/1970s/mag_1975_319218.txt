What is a potato chip ? For more than a century after an American Indian chef named George Crum first deep-fried leaf-thin slices of raw potato in his hotel kitchen in Saratoga Springs , N.Y. , the answer seemed obvious . Recently , however , the definition of a chip has become controversial . Reason : products like Pringle 's Newfangled Potato Chips , made by Procter &; Gamble Co. out of a dehydrated mash of cooked potatoes and marketed in tennis-ball-like cans . Newfangled chips have a long shelf life and can be shipped over long distances without breaking . Put into national distribution this year , Pringle 's has gobbled up perhaps one-sixth of a market estimated at $1.5 billion a year . <P> The rest of the industry , made up mostly of small , regional firms , contends angrily that the P. &; G. product is not a potato chip at all . Some companies , such as Detroit 's Superior Potato Chips Inc. , Chicago-based Jays Foods Inc. , and Wise Foods of Berwick , Pa. ( a division of Borden Co. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product . The Potato Chip Institute International tried to prevent snacks like Pringle 's from being labeled potato chips . <P> Small Print . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has now ruled that " potato chips made from dried potatoes " must be labeled exactly that , and the last four words must appear on the can in type at least half as large as the words potato chip ( on Pringle 's cans they now appear in small print easy to overlook ) . For good measure , the FDA slapped a similar restriction on makers of other " restructured " foods , like fish sticks made from minced fish . To P. &G.'s; competitors , it is a hollow victory : Pringle 's , after all , can still call itself a potato chip , sort of . And because the FDA plans to issue some other general directives on labeling in coming months , Pringle 's does not have to change its label until Dec. 31,1977.
