Does Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis have a legal right to privacy that protects her from being pursued by a cameraman ? Or does Ronald Galella , who has made a specialty out of photographing the former First Lady , have a newsman 's right to dog a public figure as relentlessly as he chooses ? <P> There is no question that Galella has been relentless . He lurked outside Jackie 's apartment building , donned disguises , dated one of her maids , chased her to restaurants , barged in on one of Caroline 's tennis lessons , and popped up in front of John Jr . out on a bicycle . But as Jackie and her Secret Service guards became increasingly agile at frustrating him , Galella filed a $1.3 million suit , claiming that they had prevented him from pursuing his livelihood . Jackie countersued , asking that he be ordered to stay away . Both sides provided more than 4,700 pages of often conflicting testimony , and last week Federal Judge Irving Ben Cooper announced a decision that stopped just short of ordering Galella 's camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying Galella had " clearly " perjured himself during the trial , and that " not a single event , episode or incident was established in his favor .

Nor may he communicate with them in any way . <P> The right of privacy is not specifically in the Constitution , but Judge Cooper followed a growing number of jurists in finding that individual privacy derives protection from , among other things , the First Amendment right of free association and the Fourth Amendment restrictions on search and seizure . Whether the right to privacy overrides the First Amendment rights of the press was not really decided , however , because Cooper suggested that Galella was more a self-aggrandizing businessman than an authentic journalist . In addition , the judge found no journalistic justification for Galella 's constant surveillance : " We see no constitutional violence done by permitting defendant to prevent intrusion on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good measure , the judge pronounced Galella guilty of contempt of court both before and during the trial and said he would fine him on three separate counts . Galella 's lawyer , who was also scolded for " unprofessional conduct , " said he expected to appeal .
