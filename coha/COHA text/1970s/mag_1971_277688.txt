The ruinously high cost of running for political office in the U.S. tends to sabotage the democratic process . Polish-born Mathematician Martin Krakowski , a private consultant in Washington , has an idea that might not and exorbitant campaign spending but would at least keep every candidate nervously honest . <P> According to the Krakowski formula , every paid political advertisement on TV or radio or in print would have to be accompanied by a report of how much the ad cost and how much the candidate had spent to date on political spiels . Thus : " The following announcement was purchased by the Gerry Mander for Congress Committee for $1,800 . Total television expenditures for Candidate Mander as of 10 p.m. , Oct. 6 , 1972 , are $121,500 . " <P> The inequity between rich and poor candidates would continue . But by anchoring every political flight of fancy to the crass facts of money , the Krakowski formula would be a form of truth in packaging , a modest destroyer of the adman 's theatrical illusions whereby so many candidates are elected .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @          @x The ruinously high cost of running for political office in the U.S. tends to sabotage the democratic process .
