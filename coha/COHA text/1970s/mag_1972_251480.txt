" What are you doing for us ? " the old man demanded of Bruce Bauer , director of community services for North Hennepin State Junior College in suburban Minneapolis . The answer was simple : nothing . Unlike most community colleges , however , North Hennepin decided to offer tuition-free courses specifically designed for the elderly , including , for a start , seminars on lip reading , physical fitness and organizing for " senior power . " The response was spectacular . Expecting only 100 , the college enrolled about 400-some on crutches , others in wheelchairs . <P> That was last year . By this summer , North Hennepin had some 800 older people ( ages 55 to 81 ) enrolled in courses ranging from creative writing to gardening to astronomy . Moreover , the idea of academic programs for old people is spreading to other campuses - partly because of grants being offered by the Federal Older Americans Act . At Stanford , a professor has begun preliminary planning for an " emeritus university , " and programs for old people are already under way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Petersburg , Fla . <P> How to Cope . The latest one opened last week at Mercyhurst College in Erie , Pa. , which registered some 200 students for its College of Older Americans . Like the others , Mercyhurst offers a curriculum of both cultural courses and practical advice . Not only can its students study French or art ; they can also learn how to live on a fixed income , cope with the illnesses of old age and adjust emotionally to growing older . <P> <P> " The purpose is not to just fill their time ; they 're supposed to take this knowledge and use it , " says Judith Wieczorek , 37 , who directs both Mercyhurst 's sociology department and its program for old people . Indeed , many students did register with practical goals in mind . For example , Mrs. Martha Czito , 62 , hopes the course on fixed incomes will teach her how to live within her budget ( " I know it 's late , but I 'm still going to try " ) , while Joseph Nowak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to find out if our Social Security payments are too low for a decent life , " he explained , " and whether we should fight to get more . " <P> At North Hennepin , where 80% of the " senior " students had never gone beyond the eighth grade , there is still a certain ambiguity about the purpose of education for the elderly . Some of the new applicants have asked for such prospective courses as " Sex over 65 " and " The Psychology of Dying , " but others prefer simpler offerings like " Film Time : the Oldies but Goodies . " Explains Mrs. Harriet Heesen , who has taken creative writing and whose grandson is enrolled at the same college : " I 'm just doing what I enjoy . If I learn along the way , fine , but I 'm going on 80 , and who needs more education at my age ? "
