The polls had not even closed when Ed Sadlowski , insurgent candidate for president of the 1.4 million-member United Steelworkers , began muttering about fraud . Brewing up a cauldron of bean soup at his cluttered campaign headquarters in Chicago , he told visitors that only by stealing the election could union chiefs deprive him of the presidency : " They 've done it before , and they 'll do it again . " At his opponent 's headquarters in Pittsburgh , Campaign Press Chief Hank Raebun phoned Organization Candidate Lloyd McBride at home in St. Louis . " We 're doin ' good , buddy , " he crowed . " We got this sumbitch beat . " <P> Grandfatherly Winner . So it seemed . The 500,000 ballots that union members cast last Tuesday at 5,301 local halls throughout the U.S. and Canada must be shipped to Pittsburgh , where union aides will count them under the supervision of Labor Department watchdogs . The official results will not be announced for at least another week or two , but private counts by the candidates ' organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , defeated the firebrand Sadlowski , 38 , by a margin of about 3 to 2 . His victory will bring sighs of relief at AFL-CIO headquarters and in the councils of the steel industry . It means that the federation 's biggest union has been kept out of the hands of a rebel , Sadlowski , who has sharply denounced George Meany 's leadership . It also means that the Steelworkers will begin bargaining this week for a new contract with mills still bound by a no-strike agreement that McBride backed and Sadlowski opposed . <P> The campaign was one of the most vituperative ever seen in a union election , and it continued that way to the end . On the weekend before the polling , retiring President I.W. Abel , who had hand-picked McBride as his heir , flew to Chicago to attack Sadlowski on his home turf . " I 've known Ed Sadlowski for twelve years , " sneered the white-haired Abel , " and I know his lack of ability , his lack of dedication . " McBride repeated his charge that " outsiders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadlowski , for his part , called Abel , McBride and Meany " well-heeled fat cats " who had lost touch with the rank and file . <P> When all the shouting was over , though , it became apparent that McBride , not Sadlowski , had read the union members ' mood correctly . Sadlowski had become something of a liberals ' darling by portraying himself as a lance bearer for the downtrodden , a champion of militant bargaining with the industry who would also work for social change through unionism . But basic Steelworkers average about $8 an hour , hardly a depressed wage ; many live in the suburbs , and few are disposed to left-leaning politics . Surprisingly for a third-generation " mill rat , " Sadlowski turned many workers off by referring repeatedly to " the shop floor , " an expression that mill hands do not use .
