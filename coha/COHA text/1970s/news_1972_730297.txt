txt In a decision that could free 14 million lower income wage earners from limitations on pay raises , a federal judge ruled today the administration 's Cost of Living Council must raise the wage control exemption level well anove the present 4 , t.su an pour . United States District Judge William B. Jones said the $1.90 cutoff figure was much too low . He did not say what amount of increase would be appropriate , but he suggested the $3.35 an hour level proposed by organized labor appeared reasonable . Before the ruling , persons making $1.90 an hour or less were legally free to take whatever pay raises they could get from employers , without regard to the council 's guideline calling for a limit of 5.5 per cent per year in wage increases . Appeal Is Considered Under the $1.90 cutoff figure , about 9 million workers were exempt from controls . According to Department of Labor estimates , a $3.35 cutoff would exempt another 14 million wage earners for a total exemption of about half the nation 's nonsupervisory workers . A Cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling in the U. S. Appeals Court . A spokesman for the AFLCIO , which together with other labor units filed the original suit , called the ruling " an absolute vindication of our position . " In his 20-page opinion , Jones commented that the council 's " alarm at prospect of an exemption from wage controls for 50 per cent of the nonsupervisory working force is less convincing in light of its recent ruling exempting small businesses from both price and wage regulations . " Violation Charged By Union The Pay Board , back when it still had labor and business members on it , voted down a proposal to set the exemption cutoff at $1.90 an hour , calling that figure too low . But the board could not agree on a higher figure and threw the issue back to the council , which promptly adopted the $1.90 figure . The International Union of of four to maintain a " lower " Electrical Workers argued that the council violated instructions from Congress to exempt lowwage workers from the pay controls . They contended that Congress intended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce an annual income of almost $7,000 , which the Labor Department says is necessary for an urban family standard of living . A family with a single wage earner at the $1.90 an hour level would have an annual income of $3,952 . The council 's $1.90 figure was based on a study by the Office of Management and Budget , which said that urban families of four with yearly income of less than $3,960 a year are considered poor . The council said $3,968 a year works out to be $1.90 an hour for a wage earner . The unions argued the $1.90 figure was unrealistic and asked the court to set a higher figure based on a Bureau of Labor Statistics study . This study says that families of four in urban areas with annual income of less than moo should be considered poor , and the unions said $3,63 should be substituted for the $1.90 figure .
