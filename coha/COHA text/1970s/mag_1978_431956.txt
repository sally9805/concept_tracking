 | OF COURSE your pooch is a clever beast , and your tabby is probably just as bright but simply does n't choose to flaunt it . But , to my mind , when it comes to pure native intelligence , both of them are completely overshadowed by that barnyard paragon , the pig . " Stupid swine ? " Do n't you believe it ! Scientists say that pigs , unlike all other domestic animals , arrive at solutions to problems by thinking them through , and pig experts report that the animals can be ? and have been ? taught to accomplish almost any feat a dog can master , and usually in a shorter time . There was the sow in 18th-century England that became a better pointer than the bird dogs from whom , by mere observation , she learned the skill . And the sow in Florida that some scoundrel had trained as a watchpig to guard a secluded marijuana patch ( she bit two sheriff 's deputies before being subdued ) .

Foam-rubber femme fatale , 29-21-33 Miss Piggy ( above ) each week delights 235 million viewers in more than a hundred countries on the televised " Muppet Show . " Many aspects of the TV star ? charm , grace , beauty ( and occasional pigheadedness ) ? are seen by the author in his 225-pound pet pig , Fido ( facing page ) , here strolling together near their suburban Washington , D. C. , home . The little red piglet was only 41/z weeks old when he was delivered to me from the University of Missouri ; his earsplitting shrieks and struggles against the constraints of his harness belied his 81/z-pound weight . His frustration squeal seemed a combination of a rooster 's yodel , a parrot 's squawk , and a Chihuahua 's yelps . When unrestrained , though , he would nose about happily , emitting soothing grunts of contentment . Fido quickly became a true pet , and will remain so throughout his 15-to-20-year life span . Had Fido been an ordinary pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in my suburban Washington , D. C. , home . For all their winsomeness as babies , pigs can hardly be regarded as lap animals when fully grown . Adult domestic hogs com . monly tip the scales at 800 pounds . ( The heaviest on record was a North Carolina behemoth weighing 1,904 pounds ? about the weight of a Volkswagen Beetle . ) But Fido is n't ordinary . He 's an " S-1 " miniature pig , one of several strains of scaled-down swine specially developed for laboratory-research purposes . My little " minipig " has attained his mature weight of only about 225 pounds ( right ) . Hogs Arrived With Explorers Swine first appeared on earth some 36 million years ago ( which makes them about ten times older than man ) , and they have been rooting for themselves ever since . Pigs were never native to the Western Hemisphere , although a close relative , the peccary , was ( page 404 ) . The peccary and the hippopotamus are the living species most closely allied to the true pigs . Then along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Supposedly he left eight pigs on Haiti when he landed there , " John Mayer II told me . John , a graduate student at the University of Connecticut , is researching the introduction of pigs into the New World . " From that original stock they were transplanted throughout the West Indies , and apparently returned to their wild state . Later explorers going to the mainland would pick up the feral stock on the islands and take them along as provisions . " Pigs that escaped the explorers ' cook fires survived in the wild . Some descendants ,  | after 400 years , still do . I went to Ossabaw Island , Georgia , to see them . Lying five miles offshore some ten miles south of Savannah , Ossabaw is accessible only by boat or light plane . This physical isolation is what has kept the pigs that roam Ossabaw 's 16,000 acres so free from the influences of domestic stock , which makes them ideal subjects for scientific study . With the approval of the island 's owners , university researchers launched an interdisciplinary study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet , their social behavior , and their impact on the habitat and how they 've adapted to it . Pigs Resemble Great-great-granddaddy With professors and students from the Pennsylvania State University ? and the help of three specially trained " catch dogs " ? I got a closeup look at the pigs . These beasts definitely were not models for cherubic Porky Pig or gentle , lovable Wilbur of the E. B. White classic , Charlotte 's Web . These were lean , rangy , bristly hogs with teeth like razors and , as adults , dispositions to match . With their dark hues , flat heads , and long guard hairs , they seemed to have reverted ? except for their smaller size ? to the physiognomy of their ancestor , the European wild boar . The dogs , which would bullyrag a targeted pig through salt marsh and palmetto thicket until they could pull it down by its ears and immobilize it , remained unscathed that day . They are n't always so lucky . It has been said of the wild boar that " Only the killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse bite . " Pigs in general show little fear of any creature but man , and even that seems more wariness than real fright . Fido is no exception . Although he delights in being around people ? especially if they talk to him and scratch him ? he tolerates discipline only from the immediate family . And he 's not crazy about other four-legged animals ? except my sandy Scottish terrier , Macbeth , who is his best friend and constant companion . If you can visualize a reddish 225-pound porker romping in the grass with a pale , 22-pound Scottie , you will understand why I call them the " Odd Couple . " The female Alaskan malamute that bounded over the fence one day discovered  | that three 's a crowd . For maybe ten minutes Fido endured her sniffing and yapping and nipping . Then he charged , snapping his powerful head sideways into her ribs as if he possessed the awesome tusks that ( among other things ) a prepubescent operation had forever denied him . The malamute 's flight through the air was punctuated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even nastier to legless creatures ; they do n't just batter snakes and worms ? they eat them . " A pig 'll slurp a snake down just like a piece of spaghetti , " a Kansas farmer explained . " They just love ' em . I keep a couple of hogs down at the cattle pond just for insurance ; that 's where a lot of cows get snakebit . You see , a snake ca n't hurt a pig , not even a poisonous one . " Scientific evidence supports that claim . A pig 's thick layer of fat apparently neutralizes snake venom or prevents it from reaching the bloodstream . Eating Often Is Eating Well Snakes , of course , are not everyday items on the piggy menu , just one of the many morsels that any swine will devour if given the opportunity . Their catholic appetites probably gave rise to one of the commonest misconceptions about pigs . " Eat like a pig ? " Piffle ! If humans really did eat like pigs , we 'd all probably be much healthier . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerously overeat , even with unlimited food available to them . This is not to say that they do n't eat frequently , and in copious measure . " As for greed , " the British novelist John Beresford wrote , " not even the most sincere apologist of pigs or lover of bacon can deny that they enjoy their victuals . " Ah , that they do ! A pig does not bolt its food , but chews it , and savors it , and shoves it about with the snout to release the aroma ; it revels in it . This , to a pig , is hog heaven . It is wrong to think , however , that pigs will gobble anything put before them . Fido merely plays with onions , and disdains oranges and bell peppers altogether . In one classic experiment 243 kinds of vegetables were placed in front of a pig . The animal refused 171 , prompting the experimenter 's observation that " where it finds variety , it will reject the worst with as distinguished a taste as other quadrupeds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm referring to truffles , the " black diamonds of gastronomy . " In the Perigord region of France , where the world 's best black truffles grow , farmers have traditionally used female pigs as chercheuses ? searchers ? for the $200-a-pound fungi ( page 410 ) . Truffles grow from two to twelve inches below ground , and it is the MAURICECHUZEVILLE , LOUVRE , PARIS Gift for discerning gods , a pig meets with ritual slaughter in a 2,500-year-old Greek vase painting ( above ) . Swine , both domestic and wild , were linked with deities in ancient cultures around the world , giving rise to sacramental sacrifices and thence to such taboos against eating pork as that found in Judaism . But , " originally , at least , " states Sir James G. Frazer 's Golden Bough , " the pig was revered rather than abhorred by the Israelites . " Sampling of swine shows the similarities among members of the family Suidae ( facing page ) from the bushpig and warthog of Africa to the European wild boar , progenitor of the domestic breeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its different foot structure , the New World peccary , or javelina , is considered only a cousin of the true pigs .  | pig 's job to sniff out this buried treasure . Well suited to the task , the animal 's cartilaginous snout , covered with tiny pores and a sprinkling of nearly invisible hairs , can detect a truffle ten inches deep from a distance of twenty feet . Lately , though , truffle hunting has been going to the dogs ? not because they have better sniffers ( they do n't ) , but because they 're easier to cram into the backseats of Renaults . And dogs do n't squabble with their keepers over possession of the prize . Fido Finds the Good Life Pigs feel about comfort the way they feel about a truffle : Get it if you can , but make do if you ca n't . Fido does n't have to make do . His indulgent human has provided him with a selffeeder , a self-waterer , a pet door into the family home ( until he outgrew it ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat of the winter sun . For summertime , Fido has a child 's wading pool set into a wooden deck ( the whole facility we call " Little Cuba " ; the pool itself , the " Bay of Pig " ) . The " Bay " is essential . Hogs , with minimal sweat glands , must seek relief from excessive heat wherever they can find it . For those less pampered than Fido , that usually means a mud puddle . And hence the unfortunate term , " dirty as a pig . " Hogwash ! I am convinced that any pig would prefer a swimming pool to a patch of mud . Fido is notably more inclined to use his pool when the water is fresh , and pigs in general are among the cleanest of domestic animals . They instinctively dung in the corner of their pen farthest removed from where they eat and sleep . As a result , they are easier to housebreak than a puppy . I do not claim that pigs are averse to the soil ; their snouts are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indestructible . Yet , rather than " dirty pigs , " they might , in the words of porcinologist Ida M. Mellen , " more appropriately be called  | earthy pigs , ' for it is the mother earth they love .... " And , " Soft brown earth just drying after a heavy rain is to them as intoxicating as catnip to a cat . " " Fat as a hog ? " In the first place , most pigs today are bred and fed to satisfy the demand for lean pork , and consequently are not really all that fat . In the second place , while it is true that pigs fed ad libitum can become rather ... shall we say . . . chunky , their physique is part of their glory . " The excellency of hogs is ? fatness ; of men ? virtue , " Benjamin Franklin wrote . G. K. Chesterton ? no lean personage himself ? was even more effusive : " The actual lines of a pig ( I mean of a really fat pig ) , are among the loveliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same great curves , swift and yet heavy , which we see in rushing water or in a rolling cloud . " Fido , his great jowls jiggling and ponderous underside swaying as he galumphs across the yard for a treat , would have enchanted Chesterton . It is not for nothing that I sometimes call Fido the " Galloping Gourmet . " My pet would not fit in at all with the slim , trim swine I saw at the Comanche Livestock piggery in Strasburg , Colorado . But then , he really would n't want to . Those little piggies go to market . Modern Farm a Hog Factory Comanche Livestock is a family business , but not a small one . Daryl Haerther , who runs the operation with two sons-inlaw , gave me the statistics : " We have a standing inventory of 11,000 to 12,000 pigs here , and send about 18,000 a year to the slaughterhouse . We average 61/2 litters a day , all year round , with about nine piglets to a litter . From the time they 're born until they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're kept in one or another of our specialty barns ? farrowing , nursery , finishing . " No trifle , the truffle : This crowning glory of French cuisine ( right ) , which grows 2 to 12 inches underground , commands as much as $200 a pound . The world 's best trufflers , trained pigs of France 's Perigord region ( above ) can sniff out a ten-inch-deep treasure from twenty feet away . Dogs do the same task but , because they detect only the ripest of the fungi , must work the ground daily . For the pig 's supersensitive snout , once a week is enough .  | If you think that sounds like an assemblyline approach , you 're right , but in a nation of 219 million people , whose annual pork consumption averages 65 pounds each , massproduction hog farming helps hold down consumer prices . ( The pigs do their part enthusiastically . One champion boar was reported to have mated 25 times in 24 hours . ) To the national economy , pig business is big business . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars each , on U. S. farms at any given time . They consume half the nation 's corn crop and tremendous amounts of milo , wheat , barley , and soybeans . Some 75 million hogs are slaughtered each year , but the succulent hams , roasts , and chops they surrender to pork lovers are only part of the animals ' contribution . Meat-packers have long bragged that they use " all of the pig except the squeal . " It 's true . Once they process the 65 percent of a hog that is pork and lard , they channel the rest into more than 500 products that make life pleasanter for most people ? and actually make it possible for others . The derivatives include everything from a hog-blood adhesive for plywood to an ammonium bacteria killer 400 times more potent than carbolic acid . Because the pig is anatomically very like man ? both are omnivorous , and they have ' similar digestive systems , skins , teeth , and blood ? pig-produced chemicals and glandular secretions are also extremely useful in the treatment of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heparin for thinning the blood ; thyroxine to treat underactive thyroids ; and ACTH , a pituitary-gland compound used to combat the pain of such afflictions as arthritis , leukemia , and rheumatic fever . Pig leather , probably the best known byproduct , " breathes " better than other leathers because only in pigskin do bristle holes extend completely through the hide . ( The " pigskin " kicked about by the likes of the Washington Redskins , however , is really cowhide . ) Pigskin has another use . It helps relieve the torment of burn injuries , as I learned at the Parkland Memorial Hospital Burn Center in Dallas , Texas ( page 406 ) . Specially treated and sterilized , and requiring no adhesive , it serves as surrogate skin until the victim 's own skin grows back . " You ca n't imagine how soothing it is , " research associate Ellen Heck told me . " In second-degree burns especially , where the nerve endings are exposed but not destroyed , just breathing on the exposed flesh causes incredible agony . " At Hancock Laboratories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial heart valves for human patients , using " bioplasticized " valves from pig hearts . " We do n't really know how long they 'll function , " I was informed by the inventor and company president , Warren Hancock . " We 've never had a catastrophic failure in the ten years we 've been producing them , and 60,000 have been implanted . " What , I asked , would all those people have done before the advent of artificial heart valves ? He pondered a moment , then answered . " Most of them would have died . " They Also Serve Who Live The pig hearts used by Hancock , like the pigskin used in burn treatment , come from commercially slaughtered hogs . But living swine , too , serve science , in thousands of current research projects . Even the military is interested . Bob and Marian ( Mouse ) Bailey , who operate Keller Breland 's Animal Behavior Enterprises in Hot Springs , Arkansas , have not only trained pigs to take showers ( page 409 ) but have also , with military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European wild boar , to carry loads ? internally as well as externally . " Their abdominal cavities are voluminous , " Bob told me . " We surgically implanted all sorts of things ? wooden blocks , ball bearings , aluminum cylinders ? that we had coated with beeswax , which is impervious to digestive juices . We determined that the boars could carry , with no discomfort , about 20 or 25 pounds . " The purpose of the experiment ? Radios ? Documents ? Bombs ? " Well , you can use your imagination , " Bob said . " I ca n't say ; we were n't told . " In a great many studies involving swine , the " guinea pigs " are minipigs , which weigh  | approximately the same as adult humans . Besides , full-size 800-pound hogs are too difficult to wrestle around . Fido springs from the original minipig herd , developed by the Hormel Institute of the University of Minnesota . Progenitors of those first tiny tuskers ran wild through the woods of Alabama , Louisiana , Catalina Island off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the University of Missouri 's Sinclair Comparative Medicine Research Farm for the Study of Chronic Diseases and Aging . That 's where I learned that some pigs , like some people , are as fond of liquor as they are of food . Dr. Myron E. ( Mike ) Tumbleson , a biochemist , has been making the farm 's minipigs into alcoholics since 1972 . " The pig is the ideal model for studies on human alcoholism , " Mike said , " because it is the only mammal other than man that will voluntarily drink enough ethanol to be classified as an alcoholic . Of course , some pigs drink more than others , and for our purposes we prefer the heavy drinkers . " He 's got some . Most of the alcoholic pigs  | Tomorrow 's bacon passes in review at the Clay County Fair in Spencer , Iowa ( left ) . These Chester Whites , one of more than 300 hog breeds , show the lean lines of the modern pig . In the United States some 75 million hogs are slaughtered each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Jacqueline Eichman , though , obviously thinks of pigs as something more than meat ( below ) . . n average , the equivalent of - proof vodka a day , but one of med Friendly because she 's tippler ? set a farm record : a week she drank the equivpuarts of vodka . r Turns Beer Thief Minded of Friendly several Then my own Fido stole a sixom me . He opened the alumiectively if not elegantly , by hrough them , then licked the beer off the floor . Truly a sloppy drinker . Mike takes in stride the joshing he gets about his " drunk pigs , " but sees nothing amusing about alcoholism itself . " We 've got nine million alcoholics in this country , " he said , " which makes alcoholism one of our major diseases . It is a disease and must be treated as a disease . We think the studies with these little pigs are going to help us do that a lot better . " Mike 's appreciation of pigs as research animals is matched by his admiration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You can tell their moods by the different sounds they make . " Australian researchers have recorded and classified pig noises . They found specific grunts signifying " Where are you ? " and " Who are you ? " and " Look out ! " Others appear to mean " I 'm here " and " Come and get it ! " and " Do as you 're told . " There is a menacing grunt , and a rhythmic grunt of contentment that pigs , quintessential contact creatures , use as they jostle about shoulder to shoulder and snout to snout . There 's also a mournful , heart-wrenching cry that I heard Fido use ? for hours ? after he outgrew his pet door and was forced to spend his first night outside . Pigs utter no squeals of joy ; the squeal is solely a distress call , and it can be heard for blocks . Dr. Stanley Curtis of the University of Illinois measured average pig squeals that ranged from 100 to 115 decibels . ( By comparison , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its engines exceeded 112 decibels at takeoff . ) Paeans to Pigs But the pig 's appeal lies more in its disposition than in its varied vocalizations . Wrote naturalist W. H. Hudson : " He is not suspicious , or shrinkingly submissive , like horses , cattle , and sheep ; nor an impudent devil-may-care like the goat ; nor hostile like the goose ; nor condescending like the cat ; nor a flattering parasite like the dog . He views us . . . as fellow-citizens and brothers , and takes it for granted , or grunted , that we understand his language .... " Is it any wonder , then , that enlightened souls ranging from Sir Walter Scott to poprock singer " Sweet Baby James " Taylor should make pets of these charmers ? Drewry Little , owner of a marina and tavern in Virginia Beach , Virginia , did n't think so in 1976 . A big man with a big voice and a belly that 's no stranger to beer , Drewry named his pet Hampshire pig Sweet Lips because " the first time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little piglin ' following after his mama , he reached out and kissed me on the cheek . I fell in love . " Drewry took the piglet home . He handfed the animal , bathed him three times a week , taught him to stand on his hind legs for the dozens of Popsicles he received each month , and made him a favorite of all the regular customers . But happiness was short-lived . Drewry , unlike myself , had failed to check first about local zoning restrictions . Someone blew the whistle on him , and he was haled into court . The judge ruled he 'd have to give up his pig . Drewry fought back . He appealed the case to the circuit court ( and also acquired another pig , Little Lips ) . He lost again . He appealed to the state supreme court ; it refused to consider the case . Now , with his pigs boarded at a farm , he 's pinning his hopes on the Governor of Virginia . " If that does n't work , " he declared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Supreme Court . I have never even been confronted by my accuser , and that 's a constitutional right . All I want is justice ! " But it 's the love of pigs , not legal issues , that keeps Drewry at the barricades . " Of all the animals I 've ever been associated with in my life , " he told me , " these are the most devoted . In my heart they mean just as much to me as any human does . " I tell you , I look at those pigs and say , Do you love your daddy ? ' and I swear they look up at me and answer , Uh-huh . ' " The big man 's eyes were brimming . Without doubt Drewry feels ? as I do too ? that there was more than a grain of truth in the last commandment penned by Napoleon , tyrant pig of George Orwell 's Animal Farm : ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS D Merely an early morning yawn ? Or is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation that " There exists perhaps in all creation no animal which has less justice and more injustice shown him than the pig " ? That may change if more people come to share writer William Hedgepeth 's awe of the animals ' " unquenchably inquiring minds , each with a vast capacity for sustained wonder . And such a beatific quality . "
