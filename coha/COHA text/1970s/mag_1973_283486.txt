Memories of his Russian youth float through the paintings of Marc Chagall like some well-loved dream . Although he has lived much of his life in France , he went on painting the rabbinical figures , village steeples , brides , bouquets , clocks and animals of Vitebsk . Back in the U.S.S.R. for the first time since 1922 , the 85-year-old artist was visibly moved by an exhibition of his work , some of which has been kept under lock and key as too " formalist " for the Soviet censors . Did he remember the paintings ? Tentatively touching his 1917 oil , The Wedding , Chagall replied with tears in his eyes : " More than you can imagine . " <P> ? <P> " Do n't rely on mothers , husbands , boy friends , girl friends and critics . Learn to self-analyze , " the redheaded diva told the 120 or so seniors . Beverly Sills picked up an honorary doctorate from the New England Conservatory of Music and gave the graduating class some off-the-cuff advice . " Do n't be the critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Say ' yes ' to life . " She also talked about her sudden elevation to stardom at 37 , seven years ago . " I 'd worked for 30 years and , if that was overnight success , that was the longest night of my life . " <P> ? <P> Burlesque is n't dead as long as Sally Rand can lift a shocking pink ostrich-feather fan . At a benefit for Phoenix House , the Manhattan drug rehabilitation center , Sally , 69 , got most of the midnight whistles from the Roseland crowd studded with names , from Senator Jacob Javits ( in black tie ) to ex-Evangelist Marjoe ( in jeans ) . <P> ? <P> Among her most valued treasures , Marlene Dietrich explained to the London Daily Express , is a bit of penicillin culture , the first ever developed by the late Sir Alexander Fleming . How did she win this memento ? " When I saw how his discovery saved the lives of soldiers who had lain in the mud for days , I had to see him with my own eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We became very close friends , " she explained . " Men are better than women , " Marlene went on . " I fancy myself as probably having more of a male brain . I am not easily distracted . " <P> ? <P> It was actually the day after his 30th birthday , but Broadway Joe Nomath was presented with a cake at the Sealy-Faberg Celebrity Golf Tournament in Las Vegas . Namath 's next big moment came when he got an eagle on the par 5 15th hole . Namath , matched with Golfer Marlene Hagge , said he loved it , " because I 'd always rather play with women pros than men . " <P> ? <P> China is the trip of the year . Candice Bergen is one of the Americans who has made it , having just returned with the usual testimony about the friendliness , the honesty , the self-reliance she found there-and the children . Not that there was much to interest an actress professionally-the Chinese make few feature films and the scripts have to be suitable for " the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-American , " Candy confessed . " My views are often different from my Government 's , but I know very well that a Chinese with different views from his government 's would probably be in jail . "
