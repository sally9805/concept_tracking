In Hawaii , on the north side of Oahu where the waves break like a stack of freight trains being dumped on the beach and the brilliant green volcanic mountains serve as a sounding board for the endless crashing of the surf , stands an asphalt basketball court . It is located there out of all context . When there is an onshore breeze the salt mist and roar of the surf drift above the two baskets and free-throw lanes and center jump circle like a big shimmering canopy , and sometimes there is a rainbow . Not surprisingly , the court is almost never used . Does anyone hit fungoes at the base of Kilimanjaro ? // And then there is " The Hole . " Did anybody ever not play basketball there ? The name is not familiar but the setting is : bombed-out buildings staring vacantly from the fringes , heated cement and the sparkle of broken glass from dreary white port bottles and Early Times half-pints ; rusting backboards and drooping hoops . The Hole is in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Houston or Detroit , places that teem with people but not space . As everybody who follows basketball now knows , it is from the Holes of this country that the players come : the Jabbars and Archibalds and Cousys and Guerins , although not all of the courts where they played were as mean as the one in Brownsville . And it is a part of the mystique of today 's game that from them , too , came the " underground stars " who never made it big : Jumpin ' Jackie Jackson , with legs that seem constructed of high-compression automobile springs ; " Mr. Clean " and " T-Bird " and Herman the Helicopter , who once flew up so high when his opponent faked a shot that a three-second violation was called on the man before the Helicopter returned to earth . So they say . // In a sense , all this has become clich ? d , and that is a shame . City basketball players no more deserve to be stereotyped than , for instance , young tennis players from Southern California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their college teams to national prominence this season are hardly stereotypes . Not all of them are even from the central city . The basketball fever that infects New York throws out hot flashes into the surrounding suburban areas of New Jersey , mainland New York and Long Island . Players from those parts occasionally make the trip in to the Brooklyn and Manhattan playgrounds ( indeed , the good ones feel obliged to , like gun-slingers itching to hit Dodge City ) or to the indoor hubs at places like St. John 's University or CCNY . But just as often they will stay at home and culture their own neighborhood shoot-outs. // Such a place is Westbury , Long Island , a commuter suburb 15 minutes from Queens and a half hour from Manhattan . Westbury 's current big shot is Dennis DuVal , a lean , handsome backcourt man who stars during the school year for Syracuse University . // Clad in cut-off jeans , orange practice jersey and knee socks , he sits on the steps of his parents ' small home and takes exception to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town looks almost middle class , does n't it ? " he asks . And it does  --  frame houses with tiny front yards , random , cool puddles of shade under elm and maple trees , little black kids playing in the silent street  --  perhaps too many of them , though .... Maybe lower middle class is a better term . " Well , I 'll tell you , this is n't middle class . Not nearly . People here moved from the city . A lot of them are on welfare just like they used to be . I guess things do n't look like they do in the ghetto , but I 've seen the bad and the good here , and in a lot of ways that 's helped me to get where I am. " // Where he is now is nothing like where he once was headed . If a high school teacher asked him to stop talking in class , DuVal muttered back obscenities . He cut classes , he flunked courses , he fought in the rest rooms , he hung out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krinsky , his school coach and . the person DuVal most attributes his salvation to , analyzes those early years . " When Dennis came to school Black Power and other racial movements were at their peak . There was a lot of pressure coming from all directions , and it focused on these young kids . Finally it all exploded in riots here at Westbury and everywhere else . Anybody who came through that period and still has the integrity that Dennis has can handle anything . " // After three stormy years at Westbury , DuVal emerged from a postseason tournament the most valuable player over people like John Williamson , now with the New York Nets , and Sid Edwards , a starter at the University of Houston . College scouts from hundreds of schools tried to sign him , but Syracuse was his first and only choice , and his entrance there marked a radical change in his behavior . In a lot of ways he simply grew up . " All along I 've always wanted more than what some of my old friends settled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now they see me and say , ' Dennis , man , use me as an example ! ' They watch out for me , you know , so I can be a symbol of pride to the community . " // At New Cassel Park in nearby North Hempstead the crowd has already arrived . There are Bobby Brown and Bunky Reed , old high school buddies of DuVal 's , men who , he says , " can handle themselves on any court . " There is Gordon Roe , a superb jumper who is a student at Kansas Wesleyan . There are several high school kids who talk to each other in low voices as DuVal walks through the gate . There is one kid fresh out of jail and a green high-top sneakered player known only as Bobo who plays for the Harlem Wizards and keeps his identity secret because he plans to enroll in college someday . // The court is cleared of bothersome younger players and the sides are chosen . Playgrounds often have distinguishing characteristics , and New Cassel has the trademark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slender 6 ' 2 " , is a natural guard , but here he is the tallest man on the court . // The game , in traditional style , goes to the first team scoring 15 points , by ones . Bobo , who prefers dribbling between his legs to anything else , hits a 15-foot jumper to start things off . DuVal 's team brings the ball up and works it around in a style that would please even the strictest of patterned-offense coaches . The passes are quick and accurate . Finally they stop and somebody is forced to go one-on-one . He moves down the lane for a twisting layup into a swirl of hacking arms and crashing bodies . // Fouls are hesitantly called and only grudgingly accepted in these games , so the good players have learned to put extra strength into their drives and to be cunning with their shot . DuVal plays well , but so does his opponent , Gordon Roe . There are some very flashy players on both teams , including a couple of high school kids who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot from the baseline does DuVal 's team win by a point . // There is a pause while the next team loosens up . " The moves are better here , " says one of DuVal 's friends . " Better than in the city . " It is possibly true , but DuVal is thinking of something else . // " Man , " he laughs , " in high school I used to go to Harlem and play at a court on 135th and Lenox . They called it the battleground because that 's exactly what it was . You could get killed on that court . This is my home now . // " Last summer I stayed in Syracuse , and I think it hurt my basketball . I need the park  --  the local guys , the ' I 'm gon na do it to you and you 're gon na do it to me ' attitude . It makes you a competitor . " DuVal stops for a second to retrieve a ball and then continues . // " My friends and I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happening  --  why they 're where they are , why I 'm where I am . And sometimes it does n't make any sense  --  we ca n't figure it out . No justice . But on the playground , playing our kind of ball , we 're all the same . " // DuVal moves out to the court and Danny Levi , who is now at Roanoke College , comes over and sits down . He points to a young man sitting on a bench watching the players . " See that guy over there ? That 's Dennis ' older brother Dale . He was good , man . He could do anything . Then he got messed up on drugs , but he 's O.K. now . Got a wife and a little boy . He just watches these days , though . Never plays much . Usually just sits there and watches Dennis . " // A player runs for a final drink of water , somebody tosses away a cigarette and the little kids are shooed off the court again . Dennis DuVal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was voted to the second team Academic All-America squad and was chosen in the second round of the ABA undergraduate draft by the Denver Rockets , dribbles the ball and jokes with a friend . The second game is ready to go . // Not many players who stand 6 ' 9 " and weigh in at a heavy-muscled 230 pounds could be said to look like a small boy , but John Shumate , Notre Dame 's superb center , does . His face is smooth and friendly  --  always open , usually talking ( " The team doctor says I 'd make a wonderful politician , " he says ) . And sitting in his favorite diner in his hometown of Roselle , N.J. , which is several exits south of Manhattan on the Garden State Parkway , he shows a child 's enthusiasm for everything he does . // " A bite to eat " is what he calls this meal . Not a full-fledged dinner , of course , because there is n't time . There is a basketball game that he absolutely has to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and we 'll have to drive 150 mph just to get a parking place . // " I do n't mind being tall , " he says while simultaneously demolishing two large cheeseburgers , " but I wish I could take the height off at the end of the season . Girls come to about here on me . I 'm just big . Sometimes it 's embarrassing . Like this one time when I was at this party trying to be cool , and a lot of girls were watching me , and I stood up and crushed my brand-new $40 hat against the ceiling . " He turns to the salad , three fruit cups , French fries and chocolate shake spread before him like a road map . " When I play basketball at the parks around here there 's nobody as big and strong as I am . Catsup , please .... I hurt guys . So I have to go to New York  --  137th Street in the Bronx or Pratt Institute in Brooklyn  --  for competition . // " Nate Archibald asked me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Big John , ' he said , ' you 'll be killing people soon . ' Well , there are a lot of players with a lot more talent than me  --  take Doctor J. ; why there 's no sense talkin ' about how good he is  --  so I 've got to develop myself to my limit . I 've got to be able to beat a man after 38 minutes on the court . Overpower him , crush him . " // There is nothing that resembles food left on the table . Seven minutes flat . " Let 's get out of here , " he yells . // John Shumate has always been a kid of rare dedication . In his room at Notre Dame he puts up corny yet personally meaningful things like a hand-lettered sign saying : THE THREE D 'S  --  DETERMINATION , DISCIPLINE , DESIRE . His father , a stoic , loving man who made sure John and his sisters went to church four or five times a week , is amazed by his son 's zeal . // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Dad , I got ta make it ! ' After two or three hours at the playground the other kids would always leave , but not John . He 'd be out there from dawn until dark . He 'd come home sopping wet , ready to collapse on the floor . " // The early work seems to have paid off . After missing his sophomore season at Notre Dame due to a blood clot in his leg , Shumate gradually developed into one of the best big men in the country . He received the Most Valuable Player award for his performance in last year 's National Invitation Tournament , which included a remarkable two-game stretch in which he went 20 for 20 from the field . // Shumate sits now in a speeding car in that squashed position familiar to overly long people and beats nervously on the dashboard . " We got ta hurry . Ca n't miss this game . " The car swerves to a halt down the block from the East Orange High School gymnasium. // " What you runnin ' for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The game do n't start for about two hours . " // Shumate , wearing a Notre Dame football jersey and a tennis hat , ambles off  --  content merely to be in this gym where players like Archibald , Austin Carr , Dave Stallworth , Mo Layton and Ron Behagen  --  even the Doctor himself  --  are going to clash . He is quickly surrounded by young boys who whisper to each other , " That 's John Shoomate. " // When the players finally begin warming up , Shumate becomes excited and starts talking about city games . " Last summer I played against Herman the Helicopter . I was scared , you know , psyched out . I muscled in and put the ball high on the board for a layup and the Helicopter pinned it about a foot from the top . He was smiling . His head was above the rim and his arms were coming over from the other side of the basket . There are unknown city players , like some who 'll be here tonight , who are fantastic . Pee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be out there . " // The game begins , and it is spectacular . The Doctor does n't show , but there are enough stars , enough " moves " for everyone . Through it all Shumate yells and laughs . " Look at that ! " he screams . // Some runty pip-squeak by the improbable name of Charlie Brown puts a move on Nate Archibald . It is a twisting , controlled , bulletlike process that would take too long to describe . The place nearly collapses with noise . // Charlie Brown is 31 years old , 5 ' 10 " , 145 pounds and played basketball at Jersey City State about 10 years ago . His team goes on to beat Nate 's , and he outpoints Archibald , the NBA 's leading scorer , 35-31 . He is , as John says , " a New York street player . " // " Can you believe it ? Huh , can you ? " John asks over and over , as much to himself as to anyone else . // Rockaway Park , Queens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide in places , flanked on the north by Jamaica Bay and on the south by the Atlantic Ocean . It is a quiet , working-class neighborhood filled with salt-streaked clapboard houses and the refreshing smells of a New England fishing village . // Brian Winters , a 6 ' 4 " senior guard-forward at the University of South Carolina , lives here on Newport Avenue and is part of the waning New York City tradition of superlative white ballplayers . His favorite playground at 108th Street is the same one that Bob Cousy and Dick McGuire frequented as kids . It is the court where Winters worked on his shooting accuracy and rebounding strength through the summer months of his boyhood . // People close to the game  --  coaches , scouts , sportswriters  --  are saying more and more that basketball is a black man 's game . What they mean is that basketball is a city game . Queens , and the white neighborhoods in the general area , are places where basketball is still the game for boys ; where you are not a total outcast if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of 21 . At Archbishop Molloy High School , Winters teamed with Guard Kevin Joyce in classic duels against conference rival Holy Cross and its two stars , Kevin Stacom ( Providence ) and Billy Schaeffer ( who starred at St. John 's ) . // Along with ' 72 Olympian Joyce and Mike Dunleavy of Brooklyn , Winters , who has relatives in Dublin , comprised one-third of last year 's starting Irish Mafia at South Carolina . Frank McGuire , a New York Irishman himself and onetime coach at St. John 's , likes the city players and makes a point of nabbing the best he can . Winters is happy enough at South Carolina but feels the place has its limitations . " I can take only so much of the grits  --  those Southern boys with short tan pants , long black socks and starched white shirts . Why ca n't they say something besides ' Hey y'all ' all the time ? Anyway , the guys I hang around with at school are from New York . " // Winters is different from most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . He does not search out the hotbeds of frenzied action . He is not afraid of such combat . Rather , he is confident of his ability and feels that without disciplined individual practice he can not really progress . // " I play all the time at St. John 's against guys like Schaeffer and Billy Paultz of the New York Nets . And last summer I played one-on-one against John Roche , and I think I did O.K. But there are a lot of times when I have to work on my own moves . By myself . In a game , you ca n't stop and do that . " // He keeps shooting at the rim in his backyard , and every shot that is on target continues through the hoop and bounces off the court . " You know what I look forward to when I 'm at school ? " he asks , his blue eyes never losing sight of the rim . " To coming home and shooting in my backyard . " // He continues to pump away , effortlessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway gate , disappearing around the side of the house . All that can be seen now is a ball arching from out of sight and dropping time after time through the hoop . A voice comes from around the corner . " My 25-footer from the driveway is great . Too bad I ca n't take the garage with me to games . " // Eventually Winters comes back into view , working his way in for some turnaround jumpers. // " In parks , you play to win , " he says . " You ca n't really shoot from outside because of the wind and bent rims and all that . You just drive all the time and throw the ball up any old way . That 's O.K. , but it always seems a lot of guys who play great in parks sort of fold in organized games . " // The smile leaves , and for awhile he is jut-jawed and earnest . He shoots each jumper precisely the way he shot the last . He moves around the tiny court and then backs out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His black dog comes out and watches . A boy rides up on his bike , observes for a few minutes and then moves on . There is no sound except the monotonous whack , whack of the rubber ball . // " They crazy ! They crazy ! " yells Fly Williams , super sophomore at Austin Peay University , his arms waving to show the immensity of that craziness . " They seriously insane in my neighborhood . " // He stands there smiling , holding court in front of seven or eight of his basketball-playing buddies . All of them are from Brooklyn . From Brownsville , South Brooklyn , Canarsie , East New York , Bedford-Stuyvesant ; from the ghettos and housing projects . And they all nod in agreement . // " I mean , if you do n't have a gun  --  maybe five or six guns  --  you in real trouble . The other night this dude 's standing in a building yelling , ' Shoot me ! Shoot me ! ' And this other dude was holding a gun in the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shot dude comes staggering out on the sidewalk and lays there . And the people  --  man , the people on the sidewalk  --  they just stood around and laughed . " // Williams himself laughs . So does everybody else . They laugh and punch each other at his wild delivery . He is a comedian , and like good comedians , his material is part comic , part tragic . // " Now you stand here and ask me if I look forward to coming back to good old Brooklyn . Well , I 'll tell you , there are gangs in my neighborhood who will shoot an old lady in broad daylight just to see if she 's gon na bleed . You tell all the readers that jitterbuggin ' is coming back . Jitterbuggin ' is the rage , man ! And I do n't mean dancing . " // Here Williams steps back , laughing to tears , and does a pantomime of someone pulling guns out of every part of his clothing and shooting everything in sight . // " The people around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets the feeling he is covering a lot of pain . " Man , they all think they 're Jesse James . Boom , boom , boom ! " He raises his hands and swaggers like a drunken gunslinger pouring lead into the local saloon . " Boom , boom , boom ! " He grows weak from the laughter and has to sit down . // This is Flatbush , Brooklyn , at a well-maintained park on the corner of Foster and Nostrand avenues . The area is shaded by broad-leafed trees and in a lot of ways it is not an unpleasant place to be on a hot afternoon . This , as everyone is quick to point out , is one of the nicer parts of town . None of the young men in the group  --  which includes Danny Odums , Williams ' running mate at Austin Peay , and five or six high school stars hopefully en route to college  --  live in the area . // They have all been collected from their disparate corners of Brooklyn by the mysterious Rodney Parker . Anyone wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitory , slippery ones like Williams , should first find Parker . // And who , it was asked , is this Rodney Parker ? He is a 36-year-old black , self-educated , self-employed ticket agent who spends the rest of his time scouting young playground stars . It was Parker who got Williams straightened out and selected Austin Peay as the school for him . Why does he do this ? A lot of reasons and no reasons . Nobody knows . // On the phone he had been friendly and blunt . " How many players do you want ? Fifteen ? Twenty ? You want Fly , is that it ? O.K. Tomorrow at noon at Foster Park . They 'll be there . " // And here they are now at Parker 's command . Anthony Harris , a 6 ' 8 " , 220-pound teen-ager under Parker 's guidance , explains what he knows about the man . " See , if you 're a college coach and you want a black kid from the city , you got to go through Rodney . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones that are in trouble  --  and we listen to him . He gets us into prep schools to fix up our grades , he tells us when street games are happening , he buys us soda and he never asks for nothing . I used to think , ' What 's in it for him ? ' And when I 'd ask him he 'd just smile and say , ' Be cool . Be cool . ' We call him the Mystery Man . " // About himself Parker is alternately vague and provocative . " I like the ink is all , " he says . And later , " I 'm a story all in myself . " // Basically his role with the boys amounts to that of surrogate father . " Deprived kids are always eager underneath . All they need is direction . I just push them into shape , " he says . // So here they sit like schoolchildren being guarded by their teacher . They talk and occasionally step onto the court to shoot around . // " Going to Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's some place , " laughs the irrepressible Williams . " My mom and I tried to find it on a map for three days . Excitement ? Oh yeah . We go downtown on Saturday nights there and watch the grocery trucks unload . " // Odums met Fly when the two of them played on the same team in a NYC summer tournament and combined for 75 points . Odums plays guard at Austin Peay and does not mind feeding his old playground friend turned superstar . // " Danny broke the Austin Peay season assist record because of me , " says Williams . " I 'd hit one basket and then bam ! bam ! Danny would nearly kill me with passes . I could n't get away from him . I 'd have to shoot from 35 feet to get rid of the ball . " // Williams ' reputation , somewhat unfairly , is not a good one . " Preenish , " " cocky , " " a troublemaker , " are terms that frequently pop up in the press . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way he learned as a scrawny , bowlegged kid in the playgrounds of Brooklyn . His coach , Lake Kelly , suspended him at halftime of the NCAA regional consolation game for arguing in the locker room . " You know , " says Williams , " the coach thought I was messing around . He was uptight , really excited . I do n't blame him but , you know , I 'd already scored 22 points and , man , I was helping out on this 6 ' 9 " dude . Do you think I was messing around ? " // The word is out : the big game today is at The Hole , the graffitied sunken court in the midst of the Van Dyke apartments . Fly lives across the street in an old three-story project , an architectural atrocity designed with all the esthetic appeal of prefab bomb shelters . Lloyd Free , the Most Valuable Player in the NAIA tournament , from Guilford College in Greensboro , N.C. , lives just down the way . Free was unable to call his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxuries his mother and most of his neighbors do without . // Williams ' family of eight lives on welfare . " I do n't think he 's ever seen his dad , " says Parker . " What total poverty . This has to be one of the worst places in the country . // " The point is to keep playing , not to let yourself be overcome by the dope and crime and ail that . Anthony Harris mentions that dope is n't too big a problem in his neighborhood anymore . " All the junkies have been shot . " Lenny Wilkens , one of my best friends , was never sensational here in the streets , but he kept playing and now he 's All-Pro . Jim McMillian the same way . I discovered him when he was 12 in a park game . He was n't that good but he had the best attitude I 've ever seen . The absolute best . " // Earlier in the week at a game at Riis Park in Queens , Ed Searcy of St. John 's had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's just like a grapevine the way everybody knows where to show . We travel all over the city for games . Somebody will say , ' I hear they 're runnin ' at Foster today , ' and that 's where everybody turns up . " // " Bedford-Stuyvesant is on the way out , " says Parker . " The old playgrounds  --  places like Kingston and Madison Street  --  are finished , all beaten up . Too much junk and glass . Players come crosstown now . " // In his car , Parker tours his Brooklyn . He pulls down a street and there is nothing but an entire block of demolished things . Huge craters and burnt-out autos . A grotesque vision resembling a World War II battleground. // Farther on , he stops for a few moments at a crowded corner . Someone has been shot and killed in an apartment . People stand in the street outside the front door . There is a holiday atmosphere as neighbors chat and dogs wander about . // " Did they bring him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not yet . " // " Wan na wait ? " Parker says to his players . // " Naw , " they say , and they climb back in the car and head for Foster Park . // Williams ' team is composed of Anthony Harris , Jocko ( the Rocket Man ) Jackson from Guilford College , a couple of other college players and a handful of street players . The other team is similar in makeup : two ex-collegians , a couple of undergrads , a semipro player , a couple of winos and a few playground stars . // A crowd of about a hundred watches and roars each time somebody " does it " to somebody else . The nets are nothing but random strings , and long shots from the corners occasionally drop through the rim and bounce off the players ' heads . // " Ca n't put up rope nets or they get stolen , " says the park director . " Put up chain nets , and these guys would leave half their fingers up there . " // Williams , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball . He dribbles less than a foot off the ground , and no matter how closely he is guarded he always seems wide open . He drives on a big man and the big man goes up high  --  way above the rim . Williams pumps in midair and then switches hands and lays in a soft left-hander . Little kids grab their heads in wonder . // A man dribbles in for an easy fast-break layup and puts the ball high on the board . Jackson , 6 ' 1 " , trails him and suddenly springs up over the man 's back and pins the ball with both hands like a person hanging a picture on a wall . This starts an escalation of moves . // Williams goaltends . Jackson stuffs . Somebody else dunks behind his head and leaves the basket thrashing so wildly that nobody can shoot at it for 30 seconds . Everybody is laughing and yelling now . Another player leaps ridiculously high on a blatant fake and the man with the ball ignores the easy shot and simply stares at the player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot and two of them stay up , clinging to the rim after batting the ball into the crowd . // Through it all Fly Williams is amazing  --  maybe , as people say , the best offensive player in America outside the pro ranks . When the game is over he smiles and shows his mouthful of missing teeth . " They yanked ' em all out at school . Said they were bad . They gave me a nice set of choppers , but I never wear them because I got gums of steel , that 's why . I can crack bones on these here gums . Besides , who am I trying to impress ? " // It is dark now , and everybody goes home or wherever there is to go . A game has been set for tomorrow at Riis Park . The grapevine is put into action . // Williams silently drinks a bottle of Coke in his crowded kitchen and stares at nothing . Outside , the ghetto prepares for another night . Dark for some ; sinister and frightening for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth around a million dollars . He knows that . He is very quiet . Tired out . It certainly is a strange life . Only a fool could call basketball just a game .
