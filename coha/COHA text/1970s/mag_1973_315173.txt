In the surge of conservationist enthusiasm sparked by the energy crisis , lights and appliances are being turned off at every hand . But such self-denial should be managed with discrimination ; some savings are worthwhile , and others are minuscule . A sampling of the energy consumption of various kinds of gear at average 1972 electricity prices : <P> HOUSEHOLD LIGHTS : A 50-watt bulb , incandescent or fluorescent , costs little more than one tenth of a cent an hour to use , but the fluorescent type delivers up to three times as much light a watt . <P> CHRISTMAS LIGHTS : A 6-ft . <P> Christmas tree lit by 75 standard bulbs burning four hours a day would use 290 of power a week , a relatively harmless indulgence . A tree decorated with 75 twinkle lights would expend 170 of electricity a week . <P> OUTDOOR SIGNS : One measuring 10 ft. by 20 ft. and burning seven hours a day would consume $76.07 of electricity a year , making turning it off a genuine contribution to energy thrift . <P> IRONS : An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is difficult to imagine a woman ironing to any power-extravagant extent . <P> VACUUM CLEANERS : Like most appliances driven by small motors , they are energy thrifty , consuming about $1.05 of electricity a year . <P> STEREO SETS : Another primarily small-motor-powered bargain ; an average one played 2.7 hours a day would cost $2.50 a year to operate . <P> TV SETS : A solid-state , black-and-white model will burn $2.75 of power a year , but a comparable color set will consume $10.08 worth . A couple that play Monopoly instead of watching color TV for one hour every night would save $1.67 a year . <P> STOVES : A standard , burner-plus-oven electric range swallows $26.91 of power a year . A microwave oven will do most of the same cooking jobs for only $4.35 a year .
