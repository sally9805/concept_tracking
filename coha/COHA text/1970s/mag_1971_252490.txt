Like stark sentinels , they loom high above the ocean waters , seeming in storm and mist to have been there nearly as long as the sea . They are the thousands of offshore oil platforms that dot the continental shelf of North America . They are the hostile homes of the offshore oil workers , a very tough and particular breed of men . Houston Bureau Chief Leo Janos went to live among them for a time on a platform off the Gulf Coast of Louisiana . His report : <P> FOR the 42 men who work a 12-hr. shift on it each day , the 20-storied South Marsh Island 73-one of 6,300 oil platforms and drilling rigs stretched across the coastal gulf-is both a punisher and a provider , a harsh , demanding and dangerous mistress . And yet the island gives as awesomely as it takes . Located 103 miles offshore , its pipelines stretch thousands of yards across the ocean floor . Drawing from seven big reservoirs 7,000 ft. beneath the primordial ooze of the gulf , it can pump 28,000 bbl. of crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> South Marsh Island 73 's heartbeat is a powerful oil drill rotating 140 r.p.m. , pushing 200,000 Ibs. of pipe with 4,000 Ibs. of pressure . There is an omnipresence about its throb and its beat , shaking the two-storied concrete bunkers the men live in , even as they sleep . It rarely ceases . " Ai n't enough wind or rain , ice or fog to ever stop that son of a bitch , " one crewman observes with grudging respect . <P> For the unskilled half of the crew , most of whom are Louisiana Cajuns and Mississippi farmers , life on the impregnable , womanless island becomes a monotonous cycle of dirt , grease , curses and the knowledge that tomorrow will be more of the same . The men , known as roustabouts , work and sleep 14 days at a time on the platform before they get a week 's rest on shore . They are tired of this life . Many would like to quit . But they can not . They find themselves trapped by the realization that however torturous the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could make anywhere else with their meager education , and that the poverty they come from is even more oppressive . So they stay , breaking their backs for $2.50 an hour , dragging 300-lb. sections of pipe and stacking endless 100-Ib. sacks of chemical mud . <P> Roustabouts or technicians , all are effectively imprisoned on their tight little island . No alcohol , not even beer , is permitted on board . Fighting means immediate dismissal ; lateness to a post a severe reprimand . Always , the threat of death or serious injury is with the crew . Two months ago , about 100 miles away on the gulf , a fiery blowout on one platform killed six men and destroyed 20 operating wells . Several veteran roustabouts have fingers missing from accidents . Last September , a roustabout was killed when a 600-lb. section of pipe fell and crushed his skull .
