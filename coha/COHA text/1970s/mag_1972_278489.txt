Can the worst disasters of the television season be redeemed ? January is when the programmers try , by inserting midseason replacements for the shakiest shows . By last week , all eight of the substitute entries were on the air . Among them : a dentist whose family adopts a chimpanzee ( Me and the Chimp ) , a put-upon executive ( The Don Rickles Show ) , a parapsychologist 's bouts with the supernatural ( The Sixth Sense ) , and movies , movies , movies . If any trend was apparent , it was simple desperation . But a blessed few shows revealed something more . <P> <P> Sanford &; Son ( NBC ) is a promising situation comedy produced by Bud Yorkin and Norman Lear , the team that created All in the Family . Like Family , which was based on a long-running BBC hit called Till Death Do Us Part , the new show is also an adaptation of an English model . This time Yorkin and Lear have taken the BBC 's Steptoe &; Son , about the tribulations of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by setting it in a low-income black milieu . In the process they have come up with an inspired piece of casting : Redd Foxx , a black comic famed for his blue nightclub material . <P> As a Los Angeles junk dealer , Foxx plays a whining parent who dominates his son with phony heart attacks and other transparent but successful ruses .

At one point when he had to refer to a black family who put on airs , he suggested using the authentic vernacular phrase " jive niggers . " A less obvious Foxx contribution : the show 's title . His real name is John Sanford . <P> Zoom ( PBS ) is a children 's show produced by kids who want to stay on their own side of the generation gap , thank you . Virtually all the material is by children and is selected by the seven-member cast ( ages nine through 13 ) . The kids sing , dance , play games , talk in " Ubbi-Dubbi " -a catchy code language reminiscent of past generations ' pig Latin-show home movies and give laconic instructions in all manner of skills . The first show featured a filmed demonstration of how to build a raft from tree limbs , leaves and an old tarpaulin .
