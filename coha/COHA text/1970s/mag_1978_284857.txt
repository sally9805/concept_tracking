As a duo , they were n't bad . Willie Nelson 's slightly nasal baritone complemented Rosalynn Carter 's soft soprano , and the crowd clapped rousingly to the music . The First Lady had no trouble with the lyrics since both she and Jimmy know Nelson 's hits by heart . The setting was the White House lawn , where Nelson , the king of outlaw country , put on a stompin ' good show last week . The most eye-opening song of the evening : Up Against the Wall , Redneck Mother . The President himself , a stock car racing buff and Nelson 's No. 1 fan , had planned the party for members of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing , some of whom rolled up to the " diplomatic entrance " in their Day-Glo colored " stockers . " Alas , Jimmy could n't get away from his Israeli and Egyptian guests at Camp David , and Rosalynn was left to entertain the down-home folks . <P> ? <P> The spooky , spaced-out waif of Carrie and 3 Women is growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duded up . It 's one of the real me 's , " says Sissy Spacek , 28 , who struts about in diamonds and furs for her first role as a mature woman in Heart Beat . The movie tells the story of the late Beat author Jack Kerouac and of Neal Cassady , a onetime car thief and the model for Dean Moriarty in Kerouac 's 1957 novel On the Road . Spacek plays Carolyn , a well-bred commercial artist who is married to Neal . To research the role , Spacek read a 1,400-page manuscript written by Carolyn and concluded that she was a well-educated , glamorous , " classy lady . " Portraying her , reflects the new , womanly Spacek , is a challenge . " Before , I 've always stretched backward in time , " she says . " This time I 'll be stretching forward . " <P> The Sandown raceway in Melbourne was packed with 61,500 people , there to see the car that had been flown in from Stuttgart and the driver from Argentina . " It 's like meeting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-time world racing champion , as he clambered into the cockpit of the Mercedes-Benz " Silver Arrow " that he had driven to victory in world title races in 1954 and 1955 . " But , " he added , " please do not think I am going to do the same things I did many years ago . This car has been in a museum and soon I will be in a museum too . " Fangio warmed up by driving in a regularity trial with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser , a fast-car enthusiast , sitting in the mechanic 's seat . Then in an event billed as " The Race of Champions " Fangio drove alone in the Mercedes , touching 165 m.p.h. during the 8.7-mile course and crossing the finish line one length behind three-time World Champion Jack Brabham , 52 . <P> ?
