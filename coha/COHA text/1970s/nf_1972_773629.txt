Lion's-paw feet , leafy bracket feet , bulbous turned feet , winged lion 's paws , heavy spirals and heavy pedestals mark late Empire pieces . Stenciling , often used to simulate ormolu mounts , and wood graining were characteristic techniques , frequently executed with skill . New forms of the 1800 ? 1810 period include the semicircular commode , Sheraton dressing chest with attached mirror ( a New England form ) and the chest of drawers with projecting small columns at sides and a swell front . About 1810 klismos and curule 0 // chairs became popular and rolled backs or projecting top rails appeared on many chairs . Sofas with upcurved ends , often unequal in height , superseded the earlier type ; these are sometimes called " Recamier couches . " Sleigh beds , also with upswept ends , were the fashionable successors to high-post beds . As the period wore on , sideboards deepened , extending almost to the floor in the general trend toward massiveness . The convex mirror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror-back pier tables are two other very typical Empire forms . Sheraton " fancy chairs " were an attractive lightweight // painted or japanned type that preceded Hitchcock chairs . Windsor chairs were still very much on the scene , and spindles were sometimes bamboo-turned . Clocks were more widely made in this period , for less expensive wooden works had made them available to the middle classes . Eli Terry 's " pillar and scroll " clock was one of the first of the American mantel and shelf variety . Equally popular was Simon Willard 's banjo clock , patented in 1802 . This was an original // American form and was turned out , despite the patent , by many clockmakers besides Willard . Late Empire forms include most of those introduced between 1800 and 1820 , as well as two more massive ones : the cornucopiaarm sofa and the wardrobe . These , then , were the trends in furniture of the Empire period , made for people who wanted the latest fashions . But much furniture of a simple , traditional nature continued to be produced Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // as well . Among the groups that were relatively immune to changing fashions were the , Shakers of New England and New York . Their furniture was in the classical country tradition ? with some distinctive nuances . The style depends on good plain lines , good wood and superior craftsmanship ; and its essential character is supposed to reflect the ideals of simplicity and purity that governed the life of the Shakers . The sect flourished from the early 1800s to the 185os , spreading from the East to Ohio and Kentucky , so Shaker furniture made between those years is varied and representative . It was effective and attractive in its own setting , and it // appeals strongly to twentieth-century Americans who see in it many of the qualities that distinguish fine modern furniture .

Besides those already mentioned , well-known cabinetmakers of the period include John and Hugh Finlay of Baltimore ; John and Thomas Seymour ( dominant until 1816 ) of Boston ; Duncan Phyfe ( dominant ) , Michael Allison and Charles-Honore Lannuier of New York ; Francrois Seignouret of New Orleans ; Henry Connelly and Ephraim Haines of Philadelphia ; Samuel McIntire ( dominant until 1811 ) and Nathaniel Appleton of Salem . Clock- // makers include Silas Hoadley , Joseph Ives , Eli Terry and Seth Thomas of Connecticut ; Lemuel Curtis , Simon Willard , Aaron Willard and David Wood of Massachusetts . The neoclassic style persisted in England , too , until about 181o , when the Regency style , the English counterpart of the Empire , took over . Mahogany and rosewood were widely used , as well as exotic veneers . The Roman and Egyptian forms described above were characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feet . i // Thomas Hope , whose book Household Furniture ( 1807 ) is now considered valuable in the study of Regency furniture , was a wealthy amateur designer . Among other contemporary designers who published their work were Thomas Sheraton , whose Cabinet Dictionary came out in 1803 , and George Smith , whose Household Furniture appeared in 1808 . Percier and Fontaine , gifted French architects and interior designers who were responsible for the excellence of the architecture and furnishings of Napoleon 's various establishments , published the second edition of their Recueil de decorations interieures in 1812 . From 1800 until about 1815 or 1820 silversmiths continued to work in the neoclassical style , though Empire elements began to appear very early in the century . The first signs of the Empire were the enlarging and broadening of forms : ovals were lowered , widened and often decorated with chunky vertical lobes or melon reeding . The shoulders of such pieces began to dip , creating a boat shape . Round or polygonal forms were also typical and prestamped or - cast bands of ornament were added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base . Popular motifs for the applied bands included laurel , waterleaf and grapevine . Handles and spouts were often cast in curving shapes that ended in dolphin or animal heads . Other cast elements included large ball feet and supports in the form of winged paws or claws ; and finials in the form of pineapples , bouquets of flowers , animals and balls . The art of Egypt provided suitable details here as in furniture : sphinxes were sometimes used as supports , snakes are seen coiling into handles or encircling bases and rims , and various stylized plant and flower forms make borders . 309 // The coffin-end spoon joined the earlier Federal type about 1800 ; this lightweight spoon had a square , clipped end and was sparingly decorated with a monogram or delicate bright-cut ornament . Table , tea , salt , mustard and dessert sizes were made , as well as ladles and forks ? though knives and forks were not generally made in American silver until the second half of the century . The fiddle-handle spoon succeeded the coffin-end in the second decade ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated with a stamped wheat sheaf , basket of flowers or shell pattern . Sugar tongs , forks and other types of flatware followed this pattern , too . The tankard 's long and illustrious history ended in this period , for while the form was still made , it had lost its early vitality . This was clue iii some measure to the widening temperance movement in nineteenth-century America , as a result of which spouts were added to many eighteenth-century tankards to make them suitable for use as pitchers and in church . The porringer , too , lost its earlier popularity . // Beakers , mugs , cups and similar vessels gradually took on swelling Empire curves and were often melon reeded or ornamented with some other bold pattern . Presentation pieces were very much in vogue , especially after the War of 1812 , when there were many heroes to honor . These pieces took various forms ? tureens , punch bowls and tea sets were among them ? but they were always of impressive size and decoration . Many were modeled after such classical forms as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kinship with earlier heroes was further stressed by decorative motifs inspired by ancient mythology . Symbols of the industry and plentiful harvest of agrarian America ( wheat sheaves , beehives , baskets of flowers ) or of the free republican spirit ( acorns , eagles , stars ) appeared frequently , too . Less awesome pieces of silver were also commissioned and inscribed with more personal sentiments expressing appreciation or admiration . Early in the period the barrel-shape pitcher , modeled on a ceramic pitcher from Liverpool , was popular . Later , pitchers fol312 1800 ? 1825 : FEDERAL AND EMPIRE STYLES lowed the Empire trend toward roundness and a low center of gravity . The ewer , often of classically inspired Greek-vase shape , was another impressive contemporary piece . The tea service and other imposing silver items had become especially popular as a result of the wide use of sideboards , which offered an ideal place for the display of special pieces . Tea sets and the newly important dinner services with matching serving pieces were to become increasingly important as the century went along , gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable dishes , salt dishes and sauceboats are other typical forms of the period , frequently made in the boat i // shape and sometimes ornamented with bands of gadrooning or stamped decoration . Candlesticks were of classical-column form at first ; and chambersticks , less imposing candleholders that were easily carried from room to room , were round in section with a round base . These were often accompanied by a conical snuffer . In Albany silversmiths Isaac Hutton and Shepard and Boyd were working ; in Baltimore ( where from 1814 to 1830 hallmarks based on the English system were required on all silver plate ) Standish Barry , Samuel Kirk and John Lynch ; in Boston Joseph Loring , Ebenezer Moulton and Paul Revere ( until i 804 ) ; in New // York William G. Forbes ( until 18og ) , Ephraim Brasher , John Forbes , John Vernon , Hugh Wishart , George Carleton and Frederick Marquand ; in Philadelphia Joseph Anthony , Simon Chaudron , Thomas Fletcher and Sidney Gardiner ( who were associated from 1814 to 1838 in the firm of Fletcher &; Gardiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joseph Lownes ( until 1816 ) , John McMullin and Christian Wiltberger . English silversmiths abandoned the neoclassical for the Regency style about 181o , combining Greco-Roman , Gothic , Egyptian , Chinese and Indian motifs in a decorative idiom that also included a much wider use of cast ornament . Among Regency craftsmen were Paul Storr ( dominant until 1834 ) ; Peter , Ann and William Bateman ; Robert Garrard ; Rundell , Bridge and Rundell ( royal goldsmiths , for whom Storr worked for many years ) ; and John Wakelin . A new development was the rise of designers , such as John Flaxman and Thomas Stothard , who did not actually work the metal . In 18o6 Charles H. Tatham 's Designs for Ornamental Plate appeared , giving impetus to the trend toward sculptural silver . Ceramics With the end of the Revolutionary War and the consequent lifting of bans on trade and manufacture , the range of Americanmade products had greatly increased . But one important area in which English imports continued to dominate was that of ceramics , and the variety of appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . This meant , once again , that American potters were left to fill the need for crockery of a purely practical nature . Occasional attempts to compete in the dinner- , tea- and ornamental-ware market were met with the same lack of enthusiasm that had thwarted earlier efforts . Noteworthy among makers of early nineteenth-century American ceramics was the Bell family , led at this time by Peter Bell of Hagerstown , Maryland , and Winchester , Virginia . The Bells and their fellow potters in the Shenandoah Valley made up a large and prosperous group who followed the old tradition of making slip-decorated redware . A little farther north , in New Jersey , Xerxes Price is known to have been producing stoneware at 315 // what is now Sayreville as early as 1802 ; his jars were stamped " XP . " Paul Cushman of Albany , New York , operated a stoneware pottery from 1809 until about 1832 . He is known for jugs and jars inscribed with his name , the date and the location of his factory . New England potters include Thomas Crafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross of Hartford , at work by 1807 and the first New England potter to mark his stoneware with his name ; and L. Norton &; Company of Bennington , Vermont , which from 1823 continued the Norton family tradition of producing dairy and kitchen vessels in redware and stoneware . Lura Woodside Watkins , authority on early New England pottery , has observed that in the nineteenth century " the whole art of potting deteriorated to the production of thick and utilitarian wares . " Of stoneware jugs , pots and crocks in particular she says , " The appeal . . . for us today comes more from their decoration than from the objects . " Simple arrangements of impressed // motifs such as hearts , crosses and tassels , sometimes enhanced by a touch of blue , were characteristic , while incised flowers , fish and birds are found on more imaginatively decorated stonewares . Nineteenth-century examples are often marked with the manufacturer 's name and the date , so that from this time on tracing the history of American stoneware is considerably simplified . Outstanding in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County . Spinner is remembered especially for his plates decorated with pictures of horse racing , mounted huntsmen and so on , and for the red glaze that gave a smooth , finished effect to his work . In 1816 Dr. Henry Mead of New York produced a glazed white soft-paste porcelain vase with molded handles , but no other example of the doctor 's work in porcelain is known . English potteries continued in the early nineteenth century to employ eighteenth-century techniques and , frequently , styles . By 318 1 1800 ? 1825 : FEDERAL AND EMPIRE STYLES far the most popular of the English ceramics exported to America were the transfer-printed wares that had begun as a specialty of Liverpool . The center for such pottery began to shift to Staffordshire about 1800 , and a tremendous amount was produced there throughout the first half of the century . The favored jug shape of the Staffordshire manufacturers was globular with a straight , circular collar , and this gradually replaced the barrel shape of the Liverpool jug . The death of Washington in 1799 inspired many eulogistic designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a monument to Washington inscribed " Washington in Glory ? America in Tears . " The War of 1812 and the visit of Lafayette in 1824 provided other very popular themes , usually printed in black , though other colors are found . The " old blue " or " historical blue " transfer-printed wares of // Staffordshire were far and away the most widely produced . Continued ill feeling between Britons and Americans was damaging the lucrative Staffordshire-American pottery trade , so about 182o Staffordshire manufacturers began decorating their tablewares with transfer prints of American scenery , public buildings and so on , which they hoped would appeal to American customers . Most mere copies of contemporary prints and paintings but some were drawn especially for the potteries by artists sent for that purpose . Cities , obscure towns , historical events and patriotic emblems proved enormously popular when printed in medium to dark cobalt blue on a white ground . The borders which surround these central designs are often very elaborate and represent one of the most interesting aspects of the blue-and-white transfer-printed genre ; they also help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wares was the Dr. Syntax series produced by J. &; R. Clews of Staffordshire . The fictional Dr. Syntax had no specific association with America , but he was such an amusing adventurer that he had broad appeal . The series is based on illustrations by Thomas Rowlandson depicting the eccentric clergyman on his travels through the English lake country . Well-known Staffordshire producers of American historical wares besides J. &; R. Clews were E. Wood , J. &; W. Ridgway , Ralph Stevenson , Andrew Stevenson , Thomas Mayer , William Adams and Joseph Stubbs . Bright flower and foliage designs , in colors which were sometimes almost garish , decorated the Gaudy Dutch pottery produced in Staffordshire from about 1810 to 183o primarily for the Ameri- // can market . The bold designs on these plates and tea wares had much the same feeling as traditional Pennsylvania German painted decoration in naturalistic and geometric patterns , and the underglaze blue and overglaze polychrome-enamel decoration of Gaudy Dutch pottery made it particularly attractive to colorloving Pennsylvania . The body of the ware was cream color and it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decoration was time consuming and put Gaudy Dutch into a higher price range than some of the other earthenwares of the period . One of them was spatterware , more quickly produced and therefore less expensive . It , too , was a brightly decorated earthenware and was intended by its Staffordshire makers to please all Americans with a taste for gay dishes . Sponged , or spattered , decoration was employed by English potters as early as the seven- // teenth century , but the nineteenth-century version was done in a wider range of colors and designs . Plates , tea and dinner wares , water jugs , platters and toilet sets with matching wash bowl and jug were turned out from 1820 to 185o in nearly 40 patterns of spatterware . Those with the schoolhouse , peafowl and tulip motifs were among the most popular . Later spatterware was produced in ironstone . Lusterware , more sophisticated than either Gaudy Dutch or spatterware , is another of the gay English ceramics that belong mainly to the nineteenth century . The technique had been practiced in the Near East from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arabs in the seventh century , and it spread from there to other European countries . It had been used in England in the latter part of the eighteenth century , but it was more fully ex- // ploited now and by 182o had become relatively cheap to produce . Luster decoration was often combined with transfer printing and enamel decoration , sometimes on earthenware , sometimes on porcelain . In the words of Geoffrey Bemrose ( Nineteenth-Century English Pottery and Porcelain ) , " The facility of English luster to mince with Miss Austen or to roister with Rowlandson endears it to the collector . " And the range of decorations , from prints of contemporary events and celebrities to " pious quatrains " and " licentious doggerel , " proves his point . Among the centers for the production of lusterware were Staffordshire , Sunderland and Swansea . A new ware which appeared in this period under a number of different names was essentially a heavy , almost indestructible white ware . One of the first to produce it was Josiah Spode II , // whose " Stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finely potted dinner and dessert services from 1805 . In 1813 C. J. Mason of Lane Delph , Staffordshire , patented Mason 's Ironstone , which found an immediate market and was copied extensively . It was cheap , very durable and as practical for large dinner services as for jugs , ornamental vases and bowls and so on . Shapes and decorations were copied during these years from Oriental porcelains . Another development that belongs to this period and that affected American ceramics later in the century is the glaze used on pottery made on the estate of the Marquis of Rockingham in // Swinton . It originally covered the distinctive " Cadogan " coffee or hot-water pots produced by this factory and was of a manganesebrown color . A similar glaze was used by innumerable English potteries and was often referred to as the " Rockingham glaze , " though " mottled glaze " is another name for it . The rival firms of Spode and Minton , both of which had entered into the manufacture of porcelain in the 1790s , were two of the chief producers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only three of the most famous eighteenthcentury porcelain factories had survived : Derby , Worcester and Caughley-Coalport . They continued to produce characteristic or popular eighteenth-century forms and patterns , and they imitated the neoclassic forms and ornaments of Sevres , but they did very little in the way of innovative work . William Billingsley did contribute something new to the art of English soft paste : a body of lovely white color with great translucency , which he claimed was equal to that of Sevres . He founded a porcelain factory at Nantgarw in Wales , but because the paste was so unreliable in the kiln he had great difficulties , and the factory was in existence only from 1813 to 1820 . Nantgarw plates often had borders of raised flowers , and these and other tablewares , sometimes with painting and gilding in the Paris manner , were the main products . On the Continent the manufacture of hard-paste porcelain continued at Buen Retiro in Spain ( until 1808 ) and at Sevres in France . The use of soft paste was given up completely at Sevres in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms and decorative motifs in imposing vases and other pieces made for diplomatic presentation . Numerous Paris factories , usually referred to by the name of their street or quarter , also made hard-paste porcelain . Their wares were very similar ? they all imitated Sevres ? and unmarked pieces are very difficult to place correctly . The whole group is often called by collectors " Vieux Paris " ( Old Paris ) , and examples in the Empire style with floral decoration are frequently encountered today . Glass Even though favorable conditions for establishing a prosperous native glass industry remained elusive , the glassblowing traditions which had persisted in the second half of the eighteenth century grew stronger in the early years of the nineteenth . Westward migration created new markets , and slowly improving methods of transportation gradually eased the problems of shipping . There were many difficulties , however . Some were financial : an uneven economy made it hard for new businesses to become well established . And there was still the attitude of well-to-do Americans , who usually preferred imported glass even though American manufacturers copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties were imposed on imported glass , but European glassmakers were loath to lose such a profitable market and used every conceivable strategy , within and without the law , to keep their wares on the shelves of American emporiums . There were two glass factories founded in this period that took firm root in spite of the vicissitudes : Bakewell k Company of 326 // Pittsburgh , representing the new Midwestern glass industry ; and the New England Glass Company of Cambridge , Massachusetts . Many smaller factories sprang up , most of them for the manufacture of bottles and window glass . Often they lasted only a short time , but some endured , and it is the wares produced in their workers ' spare time or at the end of the day that we come to first . These were practical and decorative items made for family and friends and probably for sale to nearby householders . Shapes were traditional and functional , so well proportioned that they have satisfied generation after generation . Forms , too , were traditional ; everyday necessities such as bowls , pitchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these craftsmen made purely decorative objects which had the doubly satisfying effect of allowing the glassblower to show off his skill and creating a unique ornament for the recipient . Some of the more commonly made ornaments , or whimsies , were hats , rolling pins , canes and witch balls . But many were unique ? truly whimsies of their creators . Most Midwestern glass was made by workmen trained in the tradition of Stiegel and Amelung . As new territories opened up , these craftsmen followed the settlers in the hope that they could fill the need for bottles , window glass and some tablewares . Those who settled in Zanesville , Mantua and Kent , Ohio , did have some success , for these are towns known to have been the sites of production of many Midwestern wares eagerly sought by collectors . Others settled in Wheeling , West Virginia , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , and other towns scattered throughout the territory . Their products for table use were made of high-quality window or bottle glass , relatively thinly blown and of considerable brilliance . The colors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but occasionally artificial colors such as blue and amethyst were used . Bowls and pans , pitchers of all sizes , small compotes , sauce dishes and sugar bowls are some of the most important items produced . Early Midwestern shapes were often similar to those of // the eighteenth century , but as the period went on , forms took on the broader outlines of the Empire style . Some specifically Midwestern forms evolved , too , particularly in sugar bowls and in longnecked , swirled bottles . In addition to free-blown articles , pattern-molded wares were widely made . Vertical and swirled ribbing , fluting , broken swirl ( a pattern in which vertical ribbing is superimposed on twisted or swirled ribbing ) , allover diamonds and diamonds above flutes ( a characteristic Zanesville pattern ) were some of them . The small glasshouses that were founded in New Jersey , New York and New England were staffed for the most part with workers trained in the South Jersey tradition , which had its be- // ginnings in the eighteenth-century glasshouse ' of Caspar Wistar . The Wistars ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many workers to be trained in their factory . As men left to take jobs elsewhere the tradition spread , until , by the early nineteenth century , " South Jersey " glass was being made throughout the Northeast . This was the era when increasing numbers of settlers headed for upper New York State , and many glasshouses were founded to cater to them . As always , bottles and window glass were the staples , but the tablewares that were so often a sideline fall into the South Jersey category . One of the best-known New York factories was the Mount Vernon Glass Company of Oneida County , // New York , founded in 181o ; it produced a variety of forms and styles over a long period . Articles in the South Jersey tradition were free-blown from bottle and window glass and finished with applied-glass ornament . Some of the most often encountered are threading , rigaree ( pinched trailing ) , bird finials and prunts . These are employed alone or in combination on many forms . Vases , pitchers of all sizes , compotes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in the Midwest , shapes remained the same for long periods because of the lack of commercial pressure , so South Jersey glass is often difficult to date . Another more or less indigenous American type of glass was // blown three mold , made from about 182o into the 183os .. The technique was known in England and Ireland but was apparently not used nearly so extensively there as in America . Full-size molds were used to form both the shape and the pattern in objects of flint glass in blues , greens , amethyst , amber and clear metal . The molds were usually made in three parts ? hence the name ? and a blown-three-mold piece was impressed with the mold 's design both inside and out . This is different from the later pressed glass , in which designs can be felt on one side only . Blown-three-mold glass was made as a substitute for the cut crystal of Ireland and England , but of the 150 patterns recorded by G. S. and H. McKearin ( American Glass ) , many are apparently distinctly American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the McKearins divided them into three basic categories , Geometric , Arch and Baroque . The first is by far the largest category and is made up of objects in many different combinations of ribs , flutes , circles , ovals , diamonds and sunbursts . The Arch group included patterns in which Roman and Gothic arches are prominent . Baroque patterns are composed of hearts , palmettes , guilloches and trefoils . The objects made in blown-three-mold glass were many , including a variety of bottles and decanters , pitchers , dishes and barrel-shape and straight-sided tumblers . Pictorial and historical flasks , also made in full-size ( twopiece ) molds , form another characteristic group of American glasswares . Just as these flasks have attracted a large number of modern-day collectors , so they appealed enormously to nineteenthcentury buyers , for by 182o they were almost universally used as containers for all kinds of liquids ? mostly spirituous . Their attractive colors and topical or decorative designs have been described by Alice Winchester ( How to Know American Antiques ) as being // to glass " what Currier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record of historical , social , and economic events through the period of their production . " The earliest are thought to be those bearing Masonic emblems and decorative designs of geometric motifs such as scrolls and sunbursts . The historical flasks bore portraits of prominent citizens ; national emblems such as stars and eagles ; scenes of purely local interest , and so on . Some collectors focus on old flasks of specific subjects , but many are pleased to acquire any that take their fancy . This latter group has great scope , for pictorial flasks are still being made today . The kind of popular art with a very definite national flavor that is represented by historical and pictorial flasks was far removed from the cut and engraved lead glass being made here to compete with European imports . Patterns were copied from English and Irish examples and every year there were more glasscutters coming from those countries to do the actual cutting . Thomas Caines , working at the South Boston Crown Glass Company , is given credit for establishing the manufacture of lead glass in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the hope that he could fill the vacuum in the luxury glass market created by the cessation of trade with England . The two glassmaking giants of these years , Bakewell &; Company and the New England Glass Company , were major producers of high-quality cut glass . Other noteworthy Eastern glasshouses were the Flint Glass Works on Marlboro Street in Keene , New Hampshire ( 1815-1822 , when they stopped making lead-glass tablewares ) , the Bloomingdale Flint Glass Works ( in Brooklyn ) , the Brooklyn Glass Works and the Jersey Glass Company ( in Jersey City ) . Benjamin Bakewell established his firm in 18o8 ; he made cut and engraved decanters , a variety of drinking vessels , large bowls designed to hold punch or fruit centerpieces , and the like . Bakewell 's cut glass was so highly regarded that President Monroe ordered a large service engraved with the arms of the United States for the White House . Another contemporary tribute was Goblet with cut flutes at base of bowl . paid by Mrs. Anne Royall , writing in 1828 : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold from Maine to New Orleans . Even in Mexico they quaff their beverage from the beautiful white flint of Messrs . Bakewell , Page &; Bakewell of our city . " The glasses from which they were quaffing in Mexico need not have been cut or engraved , however , for Bakewell also made blown , blown molded , blown three mold and other types of the period , including window glass and ordinary bottles . The New England Glass Company was formed under the direction of Deming Jarves in 1818 . There , too , all sorts of domestic glasswares were made in lead glass , clear and colored , cut and engraved , free-blown , molded and later pressed . Cutters were imported from abroad , and indeed , from the beginning the company produced glass which was " in quality and purity . . . not excelled by any other manufacturer in America or for that matter in any country " ( McKearin , American Glass ) . Most of the engraved and cut glass turned out by these factories and after 182o by many smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European glassmakers , on the other hand , were working out elaborate decorative effects to enhance fine glass further . Cameo encrustations , or sulphides , as they were also called , gave glasswares something of the neoclassical look made so popular by Wedgwood 's jasperware . The technique involved enclosing a white-paste medallion ? often a portrait bust of a famous personage ? in the glass substance . Some noteworthy work of this kind had been done in Bohemia and France , and in 1819 the Englishman Apsley Pellatt ( Jr. ) patented his own version . Paperweights , decanters , wineglasses and scent bottles are some of the forms decorated in this way . The glass excise tax was still drastically affecting glass production in England and was probably the cause of glassmakers ' turning to bottle glass for the manufacture of everyday tablewares . The tax on bottle glass was only one-fifth that on lead glass , so it was obviously a much more economical material . The glasshouse at Nailsea is credited with the production of a whole class of tablewares of leadless glass . The earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored enamel chips . Another type was of a lighter smoky green metal with threads of white trailed around the rim or lip . The third ? and perhaps most famous ? type was boldly looped or striped . Bottles , jugs and flasks most often bore the distinctive looped decoration , but more sophisticated novelty items with refined looping which can really be classed as latticinio were also made . Pipes , shoes , bells and hats were some of the novelty forms blown in pale green glass with decoration in white , pale pink and occasionally other colors . According to tradition , round glass " witch balls " were hung in cottages to ward off evil spirits . Whether the spirits in the neighborhood of Nailsea were predominantly evil is not known , but witch balls , decorated with bright daubs of - color , are today attributed to that factory . There is no documentary evidence , in fact , of the Nailsea establishment 's having produced any of this glass ? and these same types are known to have been made at other // factories ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the same . Ireland , meanwhile , continued to do an excellent business in cut glass . Prominent in this period was the Waterloo Glasshouse Company of Cork , established in 1815 . Large cut-glass table services were its specialty . Characteristic motifs of Irish glass in general in these years were pillared fluting , or half-round flutes used in broad bands , and scalloped borders , which consisted of continuous arches of scallop-shell shape . Both were admired and adopted by American glassmakers , who were on the verge of achieving their great dream : a firmly rooted American glass industry . Historical background PRESIDENTS : JOHN QUINCY ADAMS , 1825-1829 ; ANDREW JACKSON , 1829-1837 ; MARTIN VAN BUREN , 1837-1841 ; WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON , 1841 ; JOHN TYLER , 1841-1845 ; // Reason , cultivated and exercised with pride by eighteenth-century men , was swept away by the Romantic wave of the nineteenth century . Inspired by ancient civilizations with whose greatness they identified themselves , yet fascinated by the possibilities of their own political independence and the industrial revolution , Americans in all walks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were looking away from Europe toward their own culture and , especially , toward the West . This shift in focus was encouraged by Andrew Jackson , champion of the common man and enemy of privilege and monopoly . He looked after the interests of factory workers in the cities and farmers migrating westward , and he fought to break the hold of Eastern power over the country 's economy . Jackson 's election in 1828 was in fact one of the turning points of the century , for it represented the coming of age of government by all the people . America was coming of age in other areas too , and one of the most important was transportation . The first American steam locomotive began a regular run in South Carolina in 183o , and in 339 // 1838 the first steamship from England to America arrived in New York . From about 1833 to 1858 the clipper ships , those beautiful vessels that seemed to fly across the water , were an important factor in the booming shipping trade .

Arkansas joined the Union in 1836 , Michigan in 1837 , Florida and Texas in 1845 , Iowa in 1846 , Wisconsin in 1848 and California in 185o ; in 1847 Salt Lake City was founded by the Mormons . Western expansion was so rapid , in fact , that in 1837 it caused a great commercial panic . The Mexican capture of the Alamo in 1836 was one of a series of incidents that led to the declaration of war with Mexico in 1846 . With the end of that war in 1848 the United States acquired land in the Southwest as far as the Pacific Ocean .

Treaties with Britain fixed northern United States boundaries , the northeast in 1842 and the northwest in 1846 . Enthusiasm for charting new territory spilled over national frontiers , and in 1840 Commander Charles Wilkes discovered the Antarctic Continent . The democratic impulse was effective in small things as well as large , and some contemporary observers were shocked by the careless manners and rowdy behavior that confronted them everywhere . Frontier habits were understandably rough , but there was a lack of regard for the niceties even in the cities . Charles Dickens , describing in his American Notes a visit to the two houses of Congress in 1842 , said , " Both houses are handsomely carpeted ; but the state to which these carpets are reduced by the universal disregard of the spittoon with which every honourable member is // accommodated , and the extraordinary improvements on the pattern which are squirted and dabbled upon it . . . do not admit of being described .

On May 24 Samuel Morse 's telegraph was put into operation between Washington and Baltimore . The inventor 's first message was " What hath God wrought ! " and indeed the sense of amazement and wonder expressed in that telegram seemed to pervade the age . With each new development the feeling of special American endowment grew ; this feeling was not limited to those already here , for 1846 saw the beginning of large-scale German and Irish immigration . The discovery of oil near Pittsburgh in 1845 and of gold in California in 1848 ( resulting in the famous Gold Rush of 1849 ) opened new areas and new horizons . Labor-saving devices appeared : the reaping machine was patented in 1833 , and Elias Howe invented the sewing machine in 1845 . Events of a cultural nature also convey the spirit of the age : the National Academy of Design , founded in New York in 1826 , was dedicated to " warming into life the seeds of native talent " ; and the establishment of the Smithsonian Institution in 1846 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landmarks James Fenimore Cooper 's Leatherstocking Tales of 1823 ? 1841 explores the effects of the frontier clash between civilization and nature ; and Ralph Waldo Emerson 's Essays , published in 1841 , express the widely felt sense of being part of an all-powerful universal force for good . Godey 's Lady 's Book , a repository of " improving " stories and information about domestic and minor arts , originally appeared in 1830 , one of the first products of the popular press . In 1834 William Dunlap published The History of the Arts of Design in the U.S. , a lively ? if somewhat biased ? account of American artists of the author 's own generation as well as preceding ones . As the nation grew , so did national feelings and institutions . // The number of voters increased dramatically during this period .

Among other events of importance were the Great Fire of 1835 in New York ( which destroyed 674 buildings ) , and , in England , the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1837 . Development of the Style Defining stylistic trends becomes increasingly difficult as the nineteenth century moves on , for the turmoil , bustle and energy that characterize this fiercely democratic and aggressively experimental age are reflected in its decorative arts . The effort to express themselves led craftsmen to turn once again ? as their predecessors had done ? to the arts of earlier times . By reviving designs of the Gothic , Elizabethan , Renaissance , Louis XV and Louis XVI styles they hoped to associate their own period with the high ideals and grandeur they felt were characteristic of other centuries . Though there was a certain amount of strict adherence to specific revival styles , in general the democracy of the streets also reigned in the uninhibited mixing of decorative elements . The consistency inherent in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century styles seemed to matter much less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical motif which gained increasing importance as the Empire style developed , served as a kind of advance symbol of the course the decorative arts were to take . Its ornateness is a quality that decorative objects of the Victorian era 343 // were to display in very definite fashion ; it signifies abundance , and home furnishings were produced in quantity as never before ; it contains a wide variety of fruits and grains , and variety can be said to be the hallmark of Victorian design ; and it represents an optimism and faith in continuing prosperity typical of the nineteenth-century Romantic . It symbolizes , in short , the opulence that was so dear to the Victorian heart . Deep , rich colors , dark woods , bold patterns and lavish use of marble , gilding and mirrors reinforced the middle-class Victorian 's image of himself as a deserving participant in the good life that America offered all men . This unprecedented affluence was due in part to the arrival of the machine age , enabling textiles , wallpapers , glasswares and metalwares to be produced in quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred regularly in this period , but that craft was not revolutionized so completely as many others until the succeeding quarter century . Classical Empire forms and motifs continued throughout the period , although there were hints of the neorococo as early as the 1820s , and the 1830s saw the first of the many lesser revivals . Luxuriant and unrestrained naturalism in ornament was the first sign of the rococo , and curving lines and fruit-and-flower motifs became more and more dominant until they triumphed in the 1850s . Furniture After 1825 furniture made in the late Empire style no longer embodied the spirit of ancient classical art . Inspiration , when it derived directly from classical sources , seems to have come from an admiration of the splendid monumentality of architectural and decorative elements of the public buildings of ancient Greece and Rome . As time went on , a new phase developed in which heavy lion'spaw and leafy bracket feet and the large spirals of late Empire forms gave way to large , plain surfaces , heavy , flat scrolls and projecting columns . Adapted from French Restauration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scroll furniture , " and it was popular during the 1830s and 1840s . Examples are set forth in the 1833 broadside of the New York firm of Joseph Meeks 8c Sons ? a document which has achieved fame because it is one of the first concrete indications we have of exactly what was being made and used in a given year . John Hall , an English architect working in Baltimore , published The Cabinet Makers ' Assistant a few years later , showing a variety of simple designs for furniture orna-345 // mented with flat scrolls . The advent in 184o of the power-driven band saw increased the appeal of such designs enormously , for they could be turned out cheaply and quickly with the new machine . Another trend was the Gothic revival . It was popular here in architecture , given impetus by architect A. J. Davis ' houses in the Gothic style and , at the end of the period , by A. J. Downing 's // Architecture of Country Houses ( 185o ) . Both Downing and Davis made suggestions for furniture in the Gothic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interiors , but the style never attained more than moderate acceptance . It was limited largely to pointed arches on doors of secretaries and wardrobes , and to decorative details such as carved cusps , rosettes and fretwork designs . // The Elizabethan revival also began in the 1840s . There seems to have been some confusion in the Victorian mind about which details went with which revival styles , but the ones called " Elizabethan " included spiral twist turnings , spool turnings and split turnings in the shapes of bobbins and knobs . Cottage furniture , painted in the Sheraton fancy tradition and intended for use in country houses , often incorporated Elizabethan-revival details ; it remained popular for several decades .

Privately owned . // One of the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose stenciled chairs , also descendants of Sheraton fancy furniture , are among the most famous of all nineteenth-century products . Hitchcock stenciled his name on the seat back of his own work , but there were numerous other craftsmen who produced similar chairs in his day . Now the name has become a generic term and many such chairs have been reproduced in recent years . The Boston rocker is another well-known // painted and stenciled type that belongs to this period and to the Hitchcock tradition . It was a comfortable chair with a shaped seat and high back made of spindles . Mahogany continued to be widely used in this period , sometimes in the form of veneer over an inexpensive wood ; and rosewood was also very popular . Marble tops were much admired on sideboards , tables , washstands and many other forms . Carving , painting and stenciling remained in favor as decorative techniques , occasionally supplemented by japanning . Many forms from the preceding period continued to be made , // and bedroom , parlor and other kinds of sets , or suites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end higher than the other , was used in bedrooms ; one reclined with the back against the higher end . The whatnot , a series of open shelves for the display of knicknacks , is another typical Victorian parlor piece . A new type of desk , called a " davenport , " appeared ; it was a small , solid rectangular form that resembled a lectern and had a variety of pigeonholes within . The late Empire chair with wide fiddleback was joined about 184o by the balloon-back chair with uprights and top rail united // in a curving balloon outline . Chairs with over-the-seat upholstery were also becoming popular ; they were sometimes tufted with buttons , foreshadowing the great interest in upholstered furniture that arose in the 1850s . Clocks for wall and mantel found favor in this period and appeared in a wide variety of shapes and materials . Among the best liked was the steeple clock of the 1840s ; this was a plain rectangular form with a painted panel below the dial and a pointed steeple-shape top . The typical mirror of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style . // rectangular , too , in a painted , stenciled or gilded frame . Some examples have a decorated panel above the mirror , and some have two mirror sections . Makers of the period include John Needles of Baltimore ; Prudent Mallard and Francois Seignouret of New Orleans ; John Jelliff of Newark ; Charles A. Baudouine , Joseph Meeks Sc Sons of New York ; Elijah Galusha of Troy , New York ; and Anthony Quervelle of Philadelphia . The English were much busier reviving past styles than the Carved and lacquered desk , or davenport , made in China for the American export trade . Photo Childs Gallery . // Americans . Gothic and Elizabethan forms appeared in design books of the 1830s and the rococo gained the ascendancy in the 1840s , accompanied by a spate of less important revivals of such diverse styles as Renaissance and Arabesque . ' The balloon-back chair took the lead in the 1830s , and papier-mache furniture and allover-upholstered furniture also came into styl e . Among important English publications of the time were J. C. Loudon 's Encyclopaedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. W. N. Pugin 's Gothic Furniture in the Style of the Fifteenth Century , 1835 ; and Henry Wood 's A Series of Designs of Furniture Decoration , c. 1845 . In France the rococo was revived in the 1830s , and there was much experimentation with allover-upholstered furniture . As a result of this interest , several new forms were introduced , most of which turned up in England and America in the 1850s. 5ilver The catalogue of the Crystal Palace Exhibition held in New York in 1853 stated : Works in the precious metals occupy no inconsiderable space in the exhibition , and attract attention by their beauty and the great intrinsic value which they represent . In the American department , and to some extent in the English , they are more remarkable for their value as bullion than as works of art . In works of this kind , as we have before remarked , we are not satisfied with ordinary artistic merit . The ornament must be so rare and rich in design and execution as to give additional value to materials already rich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view and the silverwork in question , was one of considerable experimentation with form and ornament and with joining them in objects both useful and pleasing to contemporary society . Many critics of our own age have felt that they did not always succeed , and it is apparent that they were not accepted unreservedly by connoisseurs of the Victorian era ; but designers 355 // and workmen were dealing with the wholly new problems of a vastly expanded market and recently invented machines that relieved them of work they were used to doing themselves and , at the same time , opened many new decorative horizons . Round and polygonal Empire shapes and occasionally the simpler early neoclassical forms were produced in this period . The urn shape was a favorite , especially when it was set upon a high , molded base , or pedestal . It was often accompanied in pitchers and ewers by a high , looping handle that rose above the body . With the increasing popularity of the rococo , fat pear-shape pieces were much in favor , usually elaborately embossed or decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often simply a continuation of the body itself , with a low , scrolling apron and foliated feet . Parts made in the forms of flowers , vegetables and other products of nature were another aspect of the rococo revival . This ebullient use of naturalistic elements extended to cast // handles in the forms of tree branches and grapevines ; of finials in the forms of oak leaves and clusters , bunches of grapes , roses , vegetables and , in a somewhat different line of naturalism , Chinese coolies . The rococo was given an early start by the repousse work of Samuel Kirk , who began to experiment with the revival of this old technique in 1822 . He evolved an over-all floral-and-foliage pattern that is widely associated with the Kirk firm , but that was actually employed by many of his contemporaries . He was also one of the first to revive chinoiserie motifs , which proved so congenial to rococo-revival designers . Other techniques of the period include casting , engraving and chasing ( used , as well , in conjunction with repousse work : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been hammered into relief from the inside ) . Ornament of the period had many sources besides the rococo // and the classical : nature in all its aspects was glorified , and diverse luxuriant growths can be observed thriving on late Empire silver . The Greek revival , which was the notable architectural style of the 183os , provided another source , and Greek-key , waterleaf and anthemion borders , and engraved and cast laurel wreaths were used as ornaments for silver that was otherwise left quite plain . As everybody knows , the Victorians were sentimental ? about the past , about nature , about the simple life ( an understandable reaction , perhaps , to their red plush and rosewood interiors ) ? so the popularity of rustic scenes emphasizing milkmaids , cows and windmills is not surprising . Spoons were again foremost among forms of the period . The fiddle shape was dominant , and after 183o the handle began to turn up instead of down and was sometimes outlined by a molded thread . Toward the end of the period Gorham began stamping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained in favor , frequently based on // classical forms with classical and allegorical ornament . Tea and dinner services grew in popularity , too ; the tea set often had two teapots , a coffeepot or urn , sugar bowl , creamer and waste bowl . Pitchers and the more elaborate ewers were still in demand , frequently made in the urn shape mounted on a high pedestal and fitted with a high loop handle . The cake or fruit basket was another typical form , sometimes pierced in an elaborate pattern . Centerpieces in general were an important luxury item , incorporating such elements as allegorical figures , cupids or swans supporting extravagant chariots , baskets and other containers for fruit or flowers . Candelabra offered a splendid opportunity to the designer beguiled by nature , for the arms obviously lent themselves to gnarled-branch and twisted-grapevine forms . Candlesticks were at first more restrained , usually round in section with a round base , but as the rococo revival drew nearer , they began to curve and flow in naturalistic shapes . Salt cellars and mustard pots offered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , to protect the silver from corrosion , were supported by frames pierced or molded into exuberantly rococo shells , waves and leaves . Some well-known silversmiths and firms of the period include , in New York , William Adams ( who moved to Troy , New York , in 1844 ) , Ball , Tompkins &; Black , John W. Forbes , William Forbes , William Gale &; Son , Baldwin Gardiner and George S. Gelston ; in Philadelphia Bard and Lamont , Thomas Fletcher and Sidney Gardiner ( associated as Fletcher &; Gardiner until 1838 ) ; in Boston Jones , Ball , and Poor ( now Shreve , Grump , and Low ) and Obadiah Rich ; in Baltimore Samuel Kirk ( who was joined by one of his sons in 1846 to form Samuel Kirk &; Son ) and Andrew E. Warner . American silver was undergoing the same kind of development that occurred in England in this period . The acanthus and Ewer , one of a pair , retailed by Ball , Tompkins &; Black , New York . Henry Ford Museum . Sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum . // vine , prominent features of Regency silver , grew more and more unrestrained , sometimes threatening to engulf the objects they decorated . Rococo scrolls , waves and flowers appeared increasingly and the use of ornament based on natural forms in general was very important from the 1830s onward . Tropical-plant forms sprang up in the 1840s , along with the delicate tracery , engraved and pierced , of Moorish art . Elizabethan strapwork and cartouches and Gothic motifs appeared in this period , too , foreshadowing the Renaissance revival . There was great variety in surface effects , achieved through the use of parcel gilding , burnishing and mat and frosted-white surfaces . Other very characteristic motifs were military and symbolic figures , and exotic ones representing subject peoples , for this was , of course , England 's great period of colonial expansion in far-off lands such as India and Africa .
