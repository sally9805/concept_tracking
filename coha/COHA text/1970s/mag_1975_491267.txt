I have always suspected that if a horde of people would place me on a throne , provide me with eighty million dollars and the reverence which goes with it , I would stop being such a jerk  --  you know , always tense and nervous and screaming at my family and co-workers  --  and become fantastically serene . Like in " His Serene Highness . " " His Majesty is pleased to commute the sentence of all prisoners sentenced to be hanged  --  they will be shot instead . " That 's how pleased I would be . Then I discovered that I was too late . Like so many brilliant ideas , someone got there ahead of me . He is an Indian chap by the name of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , the Founder of the Science of Creative Intelligence , " the solution to all problems . " By taking a course in the Maharishi International University , according to its literature , I could learn to decrease my oxygen consumption , lower the concentration of lactate in my blood , ease my skin resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart rate , stop breathing so hard , cut down on my galvanic skin responses , speed up my reaction time , hear better , increase the growth rate of my intelligence , improve my memory , better my job performance , develop my personality , improve relations with supervisors and co-workers , decrease anxiety . reduce my level of depression , lower my blood pressure , cut down on my asthma , reduce my use of alcohol , be in better shape after sleep deprivation , cut down on drugs , behave better if I get thrown in jail , improve my resistance to infectious diseases , and reduce the time it takes me to fall asleep . Since I do not smoke , transcendental meditation could not cure me of that habit , but if I had it , it would . And , since I have all the others , it appeared that the Maharishi 's course was strongly needed . Of course , I had previously heard that The Beatles and The Rolling Stones had become steeped in Transcendental Meditation and publicly announced great improvement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it struck me that there was so much room for improvement to begin with that they never really constituted any kind of severe challenge to Maharishi . I had also on my own over the past years looked into the writings of Taoism , spice with Zarathustra , delved into the Bhagavadgita , dallied with Zoroastrians , Rosicrucians and Bahaism ; read Kant , Nietzsche , Schopenhauer , Bishop Berkeley , and Li Po , and scrutinized the philosophical tenets of Sturbridge R. Broome III , of Yonkers , New York ? " / think , therefore you are " ? which spread his fame as far abroad as South Yonkers . I had also learned that about half of the Philadelphia Phillies had taken to TM , and since they wound up in third place in the National League last year instead of in the cellar where they feel so much at home , there was some suspicion of transcendental impulses in their batting averages . But what really swung me over into Transcendental Meditation was the response from Major General Franklin M. Davis , former Commandant , U.S. Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pressure went down ten points , my wife said my disposition improved and minor stresses and strains of life around Washington did n't bother me anymore . " Well , I figured , if transcendental meditation was going to make the General happy even in Washington , nicer to his wife , and easier on the officers studying at the War College , that was for me . The fee for the course was $125 . But since the four lessons totaled six hours , that was not much more by the hour than my own plumber charges to fix a leaky faucet or clean out a sink trap in my home . It was clear to me that my spiritual plumbing was in a very shaky state and badly in need of repair . Besides , the course was so short that if it failed , it would not cut in on the time I allot to my vices . The course had been originally called to my attention by two very earnest , intelligent , likable , and serene young Americans in their twenties based in my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many citizens as possible . Both are graduates of top American universities . One received his training as a teacher of Transcendental Meditation in Majorca , the other in Switzerland . Their hair is regular length , in appearance they could be conservatively dressed young business executives or instructors in English at some well-thought-of U.S. college . They are articulate , polite , serious , and extremely well informed on their special subject of meditation . They work for the Maharishi for no pay , and besides being extremely appealing , they are also extremely persuasive , the fact being that salesmanship based upon actual belief is well nigh irresistible . So I signed up . Let me say at the outset that I found the experience rewarding and beneficial . I now meditate twice a day , and I believe that after I have enjoyed the practice for a number of months  --  I use the word " enjoy " quite carefully  --  it will prove measurably valuable to my health and peace of mind in a number of ways . The main obstacle to Transcendental Meditation in the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Eastern garb . Maharishi himself studied for thirteen years in the Hima-layas before even daring to bring TM out into the open , attaining his wisdom in the shadow of his Guru Dev ( " Divine Teacher " ) , Swami Brahmananda Saraswati , a Shankaracharya , a title of high spiritual authority , in northern India . But Maharishi , once clear of the big hills , where he once projected that it would take him two hundred years to bring TM to the entire world , has shown a lot of early foot by moving the message to the West , thus profiting by modern transportation and communication . Maharishi is swathed in robes , has the long hair and flowing beard of the traditional Indian Guru , and seems to be most at home when sitting cross-legged on a throne of rose leaves or its equivalent . But he is a crowd compeller , a veritable Billy Graham of the Kanchenjunga . Witness : in the United States alone , he has now more than 300,000 meditators , including students , teachers , business , professional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at over 1,000 American universities including Yale , Harvard , Penn State , University of Colorado , and of course- the University of California at Los Angeles and Berkeley . He has administrative centers located in over sixty countries , and the new U.S. seat of TM is now the campus of the former Parsons College in Iowa , which is even now being readied for its mission by hordes of volunteers , witnessed by a few grieving Parsons alumni and alumnae . Maharishi is no piker either when it comes to // drawing up blueprints . On January 1 , he inaugurated his World Plan to reach 3.6 billion people , and entrusted the Plan to Maharishi International University , to be implemented by 3,600 centers around the world , one for each million of the world 's population , to teach TM and the Science of Creative Intelligence , train teachers of SCI , and offer basic Maharishi International courses for undergraduate and graduate degrees . MIU has a TV station of its own in Los Angeles , and two publications , Government and Alliance for Knowledge , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every country to enhance national achievements through the Science of Creative Intelligence . While we are thus groping our way through the semantic fog whistled up by the Maharishi , it still is instructive to give his Plan a hard look and to marvel at the really wonderful results this one small mystic , trained at the top of the world in India , has achieved among the hard-nosed achievers of the West . Lest you suspect that TM is merely some misty-eyed cant whispered behind gauze curtains among losers who have abandoned just about everything else , please be advised that it has been the subject of feature articles in The New York Times ( " Thousands Finding Meditation Eases Stress " ) , the San Francisco Examiner ( " Meditation Irons Furrowed Brows in State Legislative Halls " ) , The Wall Street Journal ( " Transcendent Trend  --  Meditation Technique , Once Haven of Young , Gains Wider Following ... Businessmen , Housewives Say Method Helps Cut Tension ; Therapy for Drug Addicts ? " ) , The New Englander ( " Business Tries Meditating For Reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sense In Board Room " ) , The University of Maryland Law Forum ( " Transcendental Meditation  --  As Applied To Criminal Justice Reform , Drug Rehabilitation And Society In General " ) . The Michigan Governor 's Office on Drug Abuse stated , " We consider the Transcendental Meditation program a necessary program ingredient to every drug abuse education effort seriously concerned with providing strong and useful alternative lifestyles for its participants " ; a description of the aims and programs of Maharishi International University was read into The Congressional Record on January 28 , 1974 by none other than Representative John V. Tunney of California ; and the House of Representatives of the State of Illinois went on record as practically going all the way in support of TM : " whereas ... studies indicate that it shows promise of being the most positive and effective drug prevention program being presented in the world today ; and physiological experiments provide evidence that through the regular practice of TM ( twice daily for fifteen to twenty minutes ) the main causes of hypertension , anxiety , high blood pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ... the whole thrust of the programs of SIMS and IMS is to aid in the practical development of happy and productive citizens , " the House resolved " that all educational institutions ... be strongly encouraged to study the feasibility of courses in Transcendental Meditation and the Science of Creative Intelligence ( SCI ) on their campuses ... that the Department of Mental Health of the State of Illinois , Drug Abuse Section , be encouraged to study the benefits of TM and ... to incorporate the course in TM in the drug abuse programs ; and ... that the State of Illinois give all possible cooperation to the new Center for the teaching of the Science of Creative Intelligence to be founded in Chicago , Illinois . " Furthermore , the Scientific American recently ran an article entitled " The Physiology of Meditation : Is the meditative state that is achieved by yogis and other Far Eastern mystics accompanied by distinct physiological changes ? A study of volunteer subjects in the U.S. indicates that it is . " The study was by Robert Keith Wallace and Herbert Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harvard Medical School . ( Wallace , with a Ph.D . in physiology from the University of California at Los Angeles , in 1970 , has since been collaborating with Benson , who was graduated from the Harvard Medical School in 1961 . Their work has support from the National Institutes of Health . ) Well , good enough . Maharishi and his followers have shown themselves as masters of promotion in getting into publicity channels . They have given it quite a pedigree ; accordingly , it is only fair that we agree not to judge TM by all the freaks and kooks such an exercise naturally attracts like moths to a flame . The question then is : How does TM work ? What is it like to meditate ? One must understand at the outset that TM is neither a religion nor a philosophy . What Maharishi has done is slice off a piece of yoga practice and offer it to the West as a goodie , but he has been smart enough to let it go at that , with as little Eastern mysticism clinging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require any change in lifestyle , a special diet , or any kind of exercise . After the initial instruction , which sometimes may involve group reaction and instruction , one practices TM alone and in private . TM does not interfere with any established social or moral or religious beliefs . It is  --  just a new physiological experience . A letter from an ordained Lutheran minister who is also a theology professor at Valparaiso University , in response to a friend 's inquiry about TM , will set at ease anyone 's unease about TM 's possible conflict with Christian belief . " I had some initial reservations about TM from a religious and theological standpoint . It was not without careful and serious study and reflection that I attempted to learn whether or not this art stemming as it does from the traditions of the Far East might be compatible or infact in conflict with my Christian faith . " 1 find it to be particularly consonant with my Christian life to care for myself  --  my body , my mind , all of me  --  in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord and His service . We sometimes in churchly parlance call this ' good stewardship of self . ' That I find this discipline of meditation affording me a relief from stress , a kind of creative rest for the mind and an ordering of thought and plans , suggests that I 'm far more ready for better performance of my tasks than I would otherwise be . " The actual introductory experience to TM , if anything , is disappointingly simple . It is described by Doctors Wallace and Benson as follows : " The technique does not require intense concentration or any form of rigorous mental or physical control , and it is easily learned , so that all subjects who have been through a relatively short period of training are ' experts . ' The training does not involve devotion to any specific beliefs or lifestyle . It consists simply in two daily sessions of practice , each for fifteen to twenty minutes . The practitioner sits in a comfortable position with eyes closed . By a systematic method that he has been taught , he perceives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically on this cue , he allows his mind to experience it freely , and his thinking , as the practitioners themselves report , rises to a finer and more creative level in an easy and natural manner . ' " Jay B. Marcus , a New York City attorney , has described the process in more detail in an article in Drug Forum , volume 3(2) , Winter 1974 : " During meditation one sits in a comfortable position with eyes closed except that children under ten or eleven meditate using a modified technique that permits them to move about . With the aid of a mantra ( a sound with a known resonating effect ) selected by the teacher , the mind becomes free of thoughts and attention is naturally permitted to wander inward . It is reported that the repeated alternation of meditation with activity releases stresses in the nervous system , strengthens the mind and body and permits the individual to utilize more and more of his mental potential . TM teachers emphasize that the meditation period is not intended as an end in itself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity . " As noted , meditation involves the silent , mental repetition of a mantra , which is simply a sound , a word without meaning , which allows the attention to shift inward . This sound is believed to be an essential ingredient in meditation . Just as there are sounds that produce tension ( the screech of a subway train ) there are other sounds that have relaxing qualities . " Soon more may be known about the value of the mantras . Preliminary reports of research being conducted at the Institute of Living , Hartford , Connecticut ( the oldest private psychiatric hospital in the United States ) suggest that the mantra serves to quickly synchronize brain waves in the dominant hemisphere of the brain ( the left side in right-handed people ) . The silent hemisphere is apparently thereafter synchronized and this dampening down of the disruptive cross currents from the two hemispheres may account for a more relaxed , better functioning mind and body . " Hypotheses have been made that the mantra acts upon the brain by modulating a resonating think I 'm able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major Wall Street brokerage house : " After meditating for a year or so , you suddenly find your whole world is different . " There are simply multitudes of reactions like this . I have not attempted to penetrate the privacy of those who I know have taken up meditating . But I have discussed it broadly with them , and I can not recall one who had a wholly negative reaction . There are surprises : one of my friends who took up meditation is a highly successful businessman who owns and runs a chain of establishments , and who lives with a happy and large family about as handsomely as money can provide . Above all , he is a pragmatist , and one can visualize him as a meditator only with some difficulty . But he is highly enthusiastic over the results , and laughingly describes how he fell asleep in his car while meditating in the parking lot of an exclusive lunching spots . With his dynamic personality , his TM regime is surely a triumph for meditation . Finding certain overtones in the Maharishi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hasidic , and Sanskrit mystics over the ages , I am apt to conclude that he has simply publicized effectively a segment of Eastern thinking and Eastern ways which was always there for the taking if we only reached out for it . That does n't make TM any less valuable , if it can really add a plus to your daily living . There is a whiff of the East in the very opening TM experience . The pupil is asked to bring fresh fruit , fresh flowers , and a piece of clean linen to his first lesson , and he witnesses a ritual , including a Sanskrit hymn of thanks to the original Guru for his TM teachings , which ranges from the silly to the rather sweet , depending upon one 's degree of skepticism or tolerance . Also the pupil is requested not to reveal his " mantra " ? the word selected by his teacher as the personal secret key to the experience of TM . The mantra is a Sanskrit word which has no meaning to our ears , but is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when applied to the right type of personality , which is up to the judgment of your teacher . I imagine that my own reaction to my mantra is somewhat the same as those of other TM pupils . In truth , it is a mellifluous word of Eastern connotation which bears a melodic rhythmic relationship to the English words " cellar door , " which were once semantically described as the most musical in our language . But I am not about to reveal it to you for a number of reasons : first , because I gave my word to my teacher that I would not , and it is unthinkable to betray the sincerity of his request ; second , I have a sneaking fear ( no doubt unjustified ) that if I reveal my mantra , I will be putting the whammy on my meditating and blowing my $125 investment ; and thirdly , I have become very fond of my mantra because it works . Here 's how . I isolate as regularly as possible twenty minutes beforebreakfast and twenty minutes before dinner for meditation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcendental meditation do not mix : there are possibly unhappy reactions such as nausea and indigestion . ) I sit , rather than lie , as instructed . I close my eyes and repeat my mantra to myself , very audibly to my inner ear . It has rolling sounds , like " cellar door , " and I sometimes may find visions of waves or giant wheels framing the sound of the mantra , undoubtedly contributed by my subconscious . I become aware that my breathing and heartbeat are slowing . The repetition of the mantra is sufficient to block out most thoughts , but on some occasions they intrude . Then I mantra-ize them out of ken , and return to what is probably a delicious exercise in self-hypnosis . I am permitted to glance at my watch to ascertain the time , if that is necessary , as the sense of time values seems to wobble a bit under TM , but usually I can run up to my twenty-minute limit and emerge from meditation as an act of will and without any outer impulses . Noises do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some I do n't hear , but they do not matter . I understand that some meditate while commuting on a train , which certainly is a passage one would like to exclude from his life whenever possible . I have meditated in an automobile , although not while driving . ( No cop would excuse me from a crash if I said " cellar door " to him a couple of dozen times . ) When I started my course in TM , I explained to my teacher that I had no problems in self-image : I had long ago realized the truth and my only problem was to bear up under it . My virtues and vices are reasonably sorted out by this time in my life , and I really do n't feel the urge to get along without any of them . I do not need to be loved more , in fact after many years of making friends , I have recently been husbanding the thought that a few lively enemies might put a bit more zest in my social life . I like other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  if I may be as frank about it as I hope you will be with yourself ? usually consist of not being like me . In other words , I am the typical man in the street  --  oafishly normal , bothered by occasional attacks of self-denunciation and desire for self-improvement which I am able to repel by vigorous mental discipline , and troubled only by the lingering thought that if I had a few more smidgens of creative energy than I habitually enjoy , I could in the long run make pikers out of Leonardo da Vinci , Einstein , and Norman Mailer . So I put it up to my teacher : Energy . When I do this with my doctor , instead of reaching for a pill or giving me a shot of some miracle drug , he merely smiles indulgently as if to suggest that any adult who provides the medical profession with the awesome challenge to keep him surviving , ought to be thankful that he can hold the pen to sign for the bills . But my TM guru took me on .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
