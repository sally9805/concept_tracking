In the boom-or-bust U.S. airline industry , profits have been about as permanent as a jet contrail in a wind-blown sky . Yet last week there was evidence that at least some form of profitability had returned to the nation 's eleven major scheduled carriers ; it is expected to stay intact through the busy summer tourist season and probably through the end of the year . One by one , the airlines reported sharply increased second-quarter earnings-or dramatically reduced losses-v. the savagely depressed similar period of a year ago , when the recession was cutting deeply into pleasure and business travel . <P> American , the third largest carrier , showed a $24.8 million profit for the quarter , v. a loss of $1.5 million last year . Like the other airlines , American was favored by extraordinarily good business in June as school let out , vacations began and Bicentennial travelers lined up at airline ticket counters around the nation . In June alone , TWA earned $24.4 million , more than four times the total for June of last year ; the performance was enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black for the second quarter and to cut losses for the first half from $81.8 million to $15.6 million . As travelers swarmed across the Atlantic and Pacific in unexpectedly high numbers , Pan American , helped by a good June , posted a net of $101.3 million for the quarter . " There 's a big push to Britain , " says an American Express official . " People seem to be going there for the bargains in merchandise . " <P> Profit Plan . Some of the gains were not all they appeared to be . Pan American 's net , for example , included an income tax credit of $30.8 million from prior losses ; the airline has not turned a year-end profit in seven years and is selling off some of its older 707s to other airlines . At Miami-based Eastern , net income for the first half increased ten times , and the second-quarter results of $19.5 million were the best in the company 's history . But part of the increase was due to a temporary wage freeze urged by former Astronaut Frank Borman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though unions may not go along , Borman has asked employees to consider a profit-increasing plan whereby they would receive perhaps 95% of normal wages in bad years and as much as 106% in good times . <P> A number of factors have come together to produce the higher second-quarter results : increased fares ( up 18% domestically in 2 years ) ; fuel costs that , while high , have remained relatively stable ; and a rise in traffic of 8% to 10% . A 16% increase in travel to Hawaii in early July will probably help move United Airlines , the largest carrier , into the black for 1976 , although recovery from a strike last December still kept the line in the red for the first half .
