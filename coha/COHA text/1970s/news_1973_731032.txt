txt The U.S. labor movement is adding its weight to the drive to aid Israel . In a three-pronged effort ? money , boycotts , and resolutions of support  --  the giant AFL-CIO comes out strongly behind the Israelis . At the same time , it issues stinging denunciations against the Arabs and their supporters in the Middle East war . This pro-war stance is a shift , however , from the previous schisms within the AFL-CIO on the Indo-China conflict . There is no sign of division now , however . At its biennial convention here , the AFL-CIO " indicted " the Soviet Union for " equipping , training , and encouraging the armed forces of the Arabs " in their " war of aggression . " Then the convention voted unanimously and enthusiastically to " stand with Israel ( and ) the future of democracy in the Middle East , " the federation 's seven maritime unions announced that , effective immediately , members would refuse to load , unload , or man ships carrying cargo to and from the Soviet Union . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the AFL-CIO executive council Tuesday afternoon voted to establish a // *U.S. labor weighs in behind drive to aid Israel // labor war relief fund to aid Israeli workers whose villages , homes , or Jobs have been destroyed by " Arab aggression " into Israel . The council announced a contribution of $50,000 and said that all of its affiliates will be asked not only to contribute but also to seek contributions from their locals and members . No division now The fund will be administered in Israel through the Israeli labor organization , Histradrut . In the Vietnam war , the AFL-CIO was divided between " hawks " who supported the war effort and " doves " who sought an earlier U.S. withdrawal and peace . As the war dragged on , the schism widened . So far , there is no indication of a similar division in the federation ? or in labor ? over all-out aid to Israel . In the debate over the pro-Israel resolution , several delegates took the microphone to say that Israel , " beachhead of democracy in the Middle East , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sacrifice in financing billions of dollars in arms and other aid . Manpower ? Nobody wanted to commit himself on that , although there was a reminder that Mrs. Golda Meir , always a close friend and ally of U.S. labor , had said that Israel has no need for fighting men from outside its boundaries but just for war materiel . General support seen American unions , - particularly those in the needle trades , have large Jewish memberships , and are always in the fore of Israel bond-sale drives and other supportive programs . They rallied to the Israeli cause within hours after the news of the Arab moves across the Suez and in the Sinai . The AFL-CIO action , however , appears as strongly supported by unions with relatively few Jewish members , and the federation 's black unionistshave demonstrated their solidarity with Israel through newspaper ads calling for massive support for Israel .

" There is no labor movement in the Arab countries and , labor says , no democracy . Reports that the Arab-Israeli ceasefire was being violated prompted a strong --  resolution  --  Tuesday --  against Soviet aid to the Arabs ( " massive supplies of the most sophisticated weapons for aggressive warfare " ) and an appeal to Washington to counter this with " a massive airlift and maritime shipment of planes , tanks , antiaircraft guns and the most up-to-date weaponry " to " prevent the destruction of Israel . " Boycott endorsed The AFL-CIO also endorsed the boycott announced by its seven maritime unions last Saturday and ordered into effect on Tuesday . In the original announcement , the unions in the federation 's maritime trades department served notice that " should the Soviet Union either directly or indirectly through its satellites persist in aiding and abetting aggression in the Middle East , we will take appropriate steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handling of cargoes and vessels engaged in trade with the Soviet Union .
