txt He emphasizes inflation fight , SALT . Republicans Reagan and Baker , sensing new conservative winds in the U.S. , are already jockeying for position for a run at the White House in 1980 . But some political analysts say paradoxically it will be the Democrats who will benefit from these conservative gusts in the 1978 elections . President Carter is moving boldly on three fronts ? political , economic , and diplomatic ? to strengthen his hand prior to the 1980 elections . Within the next two weeks , Mr. Carter will be jetting to a dozen states where he will speak in support of Democratic candidates . Simultaneously , he will be collecting a pocketful of political IOUs that he can cash in later in such pivotal primary states as Florida , New York , Massachusetts , and California . The President 's political spadework will be accompanied soon by a new anti-inflation program . White House aides see the inflation problem as their most urgent , and politically sensitive , domestic problem . If a successful inflation package can be combined with a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have built what aides feel is a powerful case for re-election in 1980 . White House political advisers are looking both to their right and left as 1980 draws nearer . They say that Mr. Carter 's toughest challenge , beginning in the primaries , could come from the liberal wing of his own party . In-party challenges , in fact , could pose an even greater hurdle than the race against a Republican nominee in the general election , they say . Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts fueled further speculation that he may be the Democrat to make that challenge when on Oct. 18 he denounced the new tax bill hammered out after negotiations between Congress and Mr. Carter 's advisers . Calling the $18.7 billion tax cut bill " the worst tax legislation approved by Congress since the days of Calvin Coolidge and Andrew Mellon , " Mr. Kennedy called on the President to sendit back to Capitol Hill with a veto . The Senator criticized the bill for being skewed toward upper-income taxpayers . Mr. Kennedy 's statement came on the heels of a similar veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Automobile Workers . If Mr. Carter is to head off an embarrassing defeat in the primaries , he will need to get his political house in order ? a task he now has begun . At midweek , the President helicoptered to Baltimore for a highly successful fund-raiser , $240,000 , for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Harry Hughes . Mr. Hughes holds an astounding 34 percent lead over Republican J. Glenn Beall Jr . in the latest political poll m Maryland . Although White House aides had said earlier that Mr. Carter would go on the stump this year only to support candidates in close races , a Hughes aide says the White House had // From page : 1 Carter 's plan for fending off rivals : three-prong drive requested the opportunity for Mr. Carter to appear . ( White House officials later denied that ; they claim the invitation to go to Maryland came through attorney Clark Clifford , a friend of Mr. Hughes . ) There are obvious political reasons for a Carter trip to Maryland . It is the state where California Gov . Jerry Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown victory . But this year , Governor Brown ventured into Maryland in support of Theodore G. Venetoulis , another Democratic candidate , who lost in the primary for governor . This gave Mr. Carter an opening to form a link with upset-victor Hughes , who could later be a great help to the President in the 1980 primary there . Meanwhile , American officials say the United States is in the " closing stages " of negotiations for a new arms treaty with the Soviets . And the White House is setting the stage for what will have to be a virtuoso performance to get it through a doubtful Senate . In a support-building move , Mr. Carter inched closer to a production go-ahead for the controversial neutron warhead ? a tank-stopper for troops in Europe . Further , the imminent departure of Paul Warnke as Mr. Carter 's chief arms negotiator could help the treaty with Senate hawks , who see Mr. Warnke ? and his treaty ? as too soft on the Soviets .               @ @ @ @ @ @
