 | The Growing Scandal of Needless Surgery If the beds of all the hospital patients who will be needlessly operated on this year were lined up end to end , they would stretch from New York to San Francisco and some 1,200 miles out to sea . In the words of Dr. John Knowles , former director of the Massachusetts General Hospital and now president of the Rockefeller Foundation , this nation is suffering from an epidemic of unnecessary surgery which has now reached " incredible proportions . " Estimates of actual numbers range widely , but the shocking total most responsible authorities mention is roughly three million operations a year , or one out of every five surgical procedures . The reasons for this unfortunate situation are many , among them being doctors ' greed , ignorance , carelessness , incompetence . or indifference ? singly or in combination . In 1971 , the prestigious American College of Surgeons polled its membership about the extent of the problem . Even then , one of every ten surgeons reported that " questionable " operations were " common . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts believe that in specific categories of surgery up to 90 percent of certain types of operations are unjustified . Consider these cases : Agnes 0. , a 29-year-old Florida housewife , had for several years suffered recurring pain in her lower back . One evening , as she sobbed from a severe attack , her husband phoned a doctor , who ordered her hospitalized . At first the doctor diagnosed a " muscular spasm . " Later , he decided that Agnes ' problem was a badly tipped and bent uterus and a tumor of the right ovary . In surgery , her healthy appendix was routinely removed , her right ovary cut out and a total hysterectomy performed . The back trouble persisted , however . When she consulted another doctor she learned to her astonishment that the pains had not been caused by any of the organs that had been removed . X-rays showed that a slight curve of her spine caused her right leg to be a little longer than her left . A small heel lift and mild exercises in a short time eliminated the pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly married to a prominent Federal official , was wheeled into an operating room at an Illinois hospital for a biopsy on a lump in her left breast . Before the operation , her husband recalls , he instructed the surgeon to do nothing if a malignancy was diagnosed ; he intended to fly his wife to a renowned cancer center in New York to confirm the finding . After a quick analysis of biopsy tissue , however , the hospital pathologist termed it clearly cancerous and the surgeon proceeded to perform an immediate mastectomy , removing the breast and other tissue . Within hours , more careful testing showed that an error had been made : the breast held no trace of malignancy . California truck driver , Fred G. , consulted an orthopedic specialist about a sore back and was told he needed an extremely delicate , high-risk , expensive operation that involved cutting away part of his spine . Fred hesitated , but after the doctor told his wife that he was a " menace on the highway " in his present condition and threatened to notify his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially disabled and only later learned that his ailment was arthritis , for which surgery was completely inappropriate . After suits by Fred and some 40 other patients were filed against the doctor , investigation showed him to be a " surgery salesman " who , says a judge , operated indiscriminately on the backs , knees and ankles of dozens of trusting patients " simply to line his pockets . " It was discovered he deliberately made phony diagnoses , kept falsified records and botched many operations with horrifying results ( one woman was left with ceaseless " fiery " pain , permanently crippled and unable to control her bladder and bowels ; another had to have ' a leg amputated after he operated on her eight times ) . It was also discovered that an assistant surgeon , a pathologist and other presumed " watchdogs " on the hospital staff had been covering up for him for years . In estimated 10,000 patients annually die from needless exposure to the hazards of anesthesia , surgical intervention and postoperative recovery , according to a board-certified surgeon who writes ' under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapacitating injuries , pain , emotional distress and financial burdens that Williams says " would be staggering if accurate figures could be obtained . " And according to Dr. Walter Bornemeier , former president of the American Medical Association and himself a surgeon , " the trend is going to be toward more and more " unneeded operations . The huge number of surgeons in this country ? many of whom need to operate in order to survive economically ? combined with the notorious reluctance continued on page 158 105  | of the medical profession to police itself effectively , bodes ill for unsophisticated consumers of health services in the future . Women particularly , says Dr. Frances Norris , a Maryland surgical pathologist , seem " conditioned into reflex obedience " to doctors and consequently " have a record of large amounts of unnecessary surgery on themselves and their children . " Hysterectomies , ovariectomies , radical breast surgery , thyroid-gland operations , tonsillectomies , and appendectomies are among the procedures most commonly performed unnecessarily . But unwarranted surgery on patients of both sexes has been widely documented , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart operations . In short , virtually any part of the body can be cut without justification , while you , the patient , remain unaware of the reasons you are really on the operating table . A certain amount of surgery which proves to be unnecessary is unavoidable . Diagnosis is not scientifically perfect , and in some cases a patient 's symptoms may be so vague , confusing or misleading , that only after an operation has taken place can it be determined to have been unnecessary . But the current surgical rate in this country is far above an irreducible minimum . In 1972 , two unions , the United Store Workers and the Distributive Workers of America , instituted a rule that if an operation were to be covered by the unions ' insurance programs all members in the New York City area who were told by their own doctors that they needed operations would have to be re-examined by a union-approved doctor before surgery . Arrangements were worked out for union-paid examinations by highly trained specialists at two of the city 's medical schools . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently found that @# some 20 percent of all recommended operations are unnecessary . Says Eleanor Tilson , health administrator for the Store Workers , " Our consultants are outraged by some of the cases they see . " One middle-aged man , for example , was told by his family doctor that he needed surgery for a " diabetic ulcer " on his foot ? but the sore healed by itself after the consultant advised him to wear a larger shoe . Similarly , the 13-year-old daughter of a union member was told she needed breast surgery to remove a cyst ? but the consultant informed her family that the lump could be eliminated simply and quickly by needle aspiration , an office procedure . A 67-year-old woman was advised to have fibroid tumors removed from her uterus ? but the specialist 's examination revealed that the tumors were asymptomatic and not growing , and that there was no medical reason to operate . After another union , the United Mine Workers , began closely monitoring the surgery performed on its members and their families some years ago , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 percent in some areas ) , hemorrhoidectomies fell off by more than one-third and appendectomies dropped by nearly twothirds . Of the appendixes being removed by one physician , three out of every four were found to be perfectly normal . " The element of the more you cut , the more you make ' is certainly a major factor " underlying unnecessary surgery , charges Dr. Sidney Wolfe , of Ralph Nader 's consumer advisory health research group . Other observers agree . Dr. Charles Lewis , a UCLA medical school professor , explains : " Medicine is one of the few fields where all you have to do to buy your wife a new coat is perform a couple more hysterectomies this week . " Until exposure forced him to flee to Australia , one San Francisco MD boosted his income through unnecessary surgery by signing up as an on-call physician for big convention hotels . When conventioneers were sent to him with severe indigestion from overeating and overdrinking , he would diagnose " gallbladder trouble " and promptly remove what almost invariably turned out to be healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on posh Michigan Avenue exploited hundreds of women for high fees before authorities cracked down . A former employee says the women were systematically told that their pregnancies were further along than they really were , so that more complicated ? and expensive ? procedures could be performed . Some women who were not even pregnant were told they were and " abortions " were recommended . Such flagrant violators as these are not the only guilty ones . Doctors who consider themselves conscientious often are also influenced by financial pressures . Thirty percent of all physicians now in practice identify themselves as surgeons and 40 percent of all doctors in residency are training in surgical @# @# areas . Because of this vast oversupply. says Dr. John Knowles , " Surgical manpower is now creating its own demand A study of patients in Kansas , for example , shows that in some areas twice as many hernia and varicose-vein operations , three times as many hemorrhoid , gallbladder and tonsil removals. and four times as many appendectomies are performed per capita as in other areas of that relatively homogeneous state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher incidence of actual disease but to a higher number of surgeons , the study concludes that when keen economic competition exists , surgical cases tend to " expand to fill surgeons ' time . " Money is just one factor , however . Many experts feel that there is still greater risk of unnecessary surgery when a doctor is out-of-date , limited in orientation , insensitive to patients needs or simply incompetent . Among educators it is axiomatic that half of what a doctor learns in medical school is made obsolete by new discoveries and advances within ten years of the time he enters practice , and that unless he makes special efforts to keep up to date , he is soon practicing outmoded medicine . Surgeons are particularly subject to this hazard , says Dr. Oliver Cope of Harvard Medical School , especially when new forms of therapy are developed to replace surgical approaches . For instance , in the last 20 years , the treatment of choice for nontoxic goiter has changed from surgery to hormone therapy . Yet , Dr. Cope writes in the American Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach " and operate. ? unnecessarily ? " upon all patients with nontoxic goiter , under the impression that no other therapy would be successful . " The practicing surgeon is likely to reflect the atmosphere he encountered in training , where , Dr. Cope claims , curiosity about other procedures is often ridiculed by instructors . Training also often makes surgeons perform operations that are more radical than they need be . For example , if you develop breast cancer in this country , your chances are more than twice as high as they would be in England of undergoing radical mastectomy . ( In that procedure the breast , much of the chest and the underarm lymph nodes are removed . ) An alternative , widely used abroad , explains Dr. Frances Norris , is modified radical mastectomy , in which the chest wall musculature is left intact . " It is less mutilating , less crippling and less expensive and , according to the evidence available , produces equally good results for the patient , " she says . " With it , some 90,000 American women a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in most cases is entirely unnecessary . " Dr. Cope agrees . He says that few surgeons ever consider whether more conservative treatment " might be of any avail " to breast cancer patients . " Radical mastectomy and that 's it , rather than where is the disease , what  | are its habits and how can I best treat it ? ' " Surgical extremism threatens heart patients , too . Dr. Henry Russek , a cardiologist at New York Medical College , recently at a professional conference in Texas that a major heart operation that is performed 25,000 times a year , and involves bypassing an obstruction by way of an arterial implant , is in many cases done indiscriminately and needlessly , quite possibly killing more patients than it saves . Special combinations of drugs are available to help these patients , Russek says , yet many are rushed to the operating table before drugs have even been given a trial . The rush to surgery has made some operations almost a ritual in our society . A prime example is tonsillectomy , performed 663,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the fact that since the 1930s authorities have warned repeatedly that it is nearly always useless and that , because of possible traumatic effects on young patients , it may leave long-lasting psychological scars . If removal of the tonsils and adenoids were limited to cases in which youngsters suffer repeated , severe tonsil infections or abscesses , hearing impairment or airway obstruction ? conditions that might be improved by the operation ? the **27;1207;TOOLONG rate could be cut tenfold , and scores of lives now lost to the complications of this surgery would be saved . As it is , 20 to 30 percent of the children of most American communities undergo this procedure in the vain anticipation of experiencing fewer colds and sore throats , curing rheumatic fever , asthma , hay fever , laryngitis and bronchitis or preventing strep infections . What all this adds up to , says one doctor , is that tonsillectomy has itself become " a serious health problem . " Surgeons complain that they are often pressured into unnecessary operations by patients seeking a swift , dramatic " cure " rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed numerous instances in which it is the surgeons , in fact , who pressure the patients . A survey last October of municipal hospitals in Boston , Baltimore and Los Angeles by the Health Research Group reveals that " patients are regularly cajoled , coerced and pressured into consenting " to tubal ligations and @# @# hysterectomies , " ostensibly for medical reasons , although in reality interns , residents and staff physicians are more frequently motivated by their own needs for ' experience ' or their own social theories of population control . " These operations are often performed immediately after childbirth , and many women are pressed to sign surgical consent forms while they are in hard labor . Often they are not informed that sterilization is irreversible . In Boston , investigators reported , patients requesting sterilization by tubal ligation were commonly " talked to " by hospital doctors " until they agreed to hysterectomies . " " We like to do a hysterectomy , it 's more of a challenge , " explained one resident . " A well-trained chimpanzee can do a tubal ligation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff doctor at one Los Angeles hospital where the hysterectomy rate has more than doubled in the last two years , " we 've all talked women who do n't need them into hysterectomies . " But incompetence bulks larger in the problem of unnecessary surgery than cold calculation . If you are ill , a careless or ignorant doctor may misdiagnose your problem and an unneeded operation may result . Or he may bungle your treatment so that one or more operations becomes necessary to correct his error . The possibilities are endless , and often tragic : In New York , a benign cyst in the knee of a 24-year-old widow was erroneously diagnosed as cancer by an orthopedic surgeon , who amputated the woman 's leg ....

Simple testing later showed it was not , but by then the infection was so far advanced that her kidney had to be removed . . . . An 18-yearold housewife , eight months into her first pregnancy , reported severe abdominal pains to a doctor in California , who on the basis of inadequate investigation decided she had appendicitis , a disease extremely rare in late pregnancy . Her appendix proved to be healthy , but the traumatic impact of the surgery ? during which the doctor could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cut at the wrong place ? touched off a premature birth in which complications developed and the baby was born irreparably damaged . . . . Another Californian underwent surgery for an ulcer , during which the doctor accidentally severed the duct to his pancreas , requiring five additional major operations . The patient 's medical expenses skyrocketed past $40,000 , and he was disabled for more than two years ... . Such unnecessary carnage results , in part , because many hospitals freely grant operating room privileges to doctors who lack topflight surgical credentials . In a study of surgery in one West Coast county which is typical of much of the rest of the nation , investigators discovered that fewer than half the operations surveyed were performed by doctors considered fully qualified by training and experience to handle them safely . In only one of 16 categories of operations , ranging from hernia repair to eye surgery , did all the physicians who undertook the procedure have the proper credentials . A study of a New York suburb showed recently that among surgeons , the least qualified tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex Gerber , there often is a direct relationship between a physician 's lack of surgical credentials and competence and the amount of unnecessary surgery he inflicts . A growing number of observers believe that a thorough overhaul of our present medical system is needed to lessen surgical exploitation . Reformers want intelligent , questioning consumers , not just doctors , included in hospital review committees which are supposed to guard against abuses , but have failed miserably because of a look-the-other-way attitude by much of the medical profession . They are pushing for state or Federal regulations that would require doctors to keep abreast of new medical developments and be periodically retested in order to keep their licenses . Also they are hoping that medical schools can be forced to reduce the number of surgeons in training , that hospitals can be made to restrict surgical privileges to physicians with established competence , and that insurance companies can be required to closely audit all medical bills presented for payment so that unneeded surgery can be detected and rejected for reimbursement . Some , if not all , of these measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains true to its tradition , will strenuously oppose , and thus delay . Meanwhile , there are steps you can take as a patient to help protect yourself and your family from unneeded surgery . ? First , always insist on getting a second medical opinion before submitting to any non-emergency surgery . Do not allow yourself to be referred for this consultation to a physician chosen by the doctor who first recommends operating , but seek out a practitioner on your own , preferably someone not associated with the same hospital . To eliminate financial temptation , inform the consultant at the outset that you will not be asking him to perform the surgery should any be necessary . If you have access to a medical school 's teaching hospital , suggests Esther Levitt , @# health administrator for the Distributive Workers of America , call the head of the department for the specialty that covers your ailment and ask him or one of his colleagues to examine you . Any proposed operation should be taken seriously , warns Charles Kramer , a New York malpractice attorney . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning the procedure because a doctor thought , erroneously , that that was the best treatment to keep the nail from ingrowing . The wound failed to heal properly , gangrene set in and the woman eventually lost her leg . ? Second , carefully check the credentials and the reputation of a surgeon before he operates on you . Numerous studies have shown that unnecessary surgery is least likely to be performed by physicians who have earned , through training and experience , certification by one of the American specialty boards . Board-certified surgeons are listed in the Directory of Medical Specialists , available at most good libraries . Also , advises the Pennsylvania Insurance Department 's Shoppers ' Guide to @# Surgery , make sure he is a Fellow of the American College of Sure or the American College of Gyneco ' gists or the American College of Ost pathic Surgeons ? organizations wh membership qualifications " keep the less competent surgeons , and stress programs of continuing education . " such physicians are not available your community , Dr. John Know suggests that you " ask some local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That way you 'll g an idea whom the profession trusts ? Third , never allow yourself to be operated on in a hospital that is n accredited by either the Joint Co mission on Accreditation of Hospi or the American Osteopathic Assoc tion . While accreditation standa " are not notably high , " says the Pe sylvania Guide , " they do disqualify least adequate hospitals and the o and-out butcher shops . ' " Particul avoid small " private " or " proprieta ( run-for-profit ) hospitals owned doctors themselves . A survey c ducted by Columbia University in cates that an unnecessary hysterectom for example , is twice as likely to occuet in a proprietary hospital than in a voluntary ( nonprofit ) institution . Among accredited , nonprofit institutions , you may well be safest in a large , teaching hospital that is university-affiliated . ? Fourth , if one is available in your community , consider enrolling in Health Maintenance Organization or ir . some other prepaid , group practice plan , such as the one the Kaiser Foundation operates on the West Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee to cover any medical needs that may arise for your family , instead of reimbursing your doctor out-ofpocket or through medical insurance for each service he performs . Because there is emphasis on preventive medicine and in absence of fee incentive . the rate at which surgery is performed on patients in prepaid group plans is often half what it is for patients treated by private doctors . ? Fifth and finally , do n't pressure a doctor to perform surgery on you . Some operations ? tonsillectomy is one ? become almost fads that patients seek out with little consideration of the immediate risks or long-range side effects . Read up on what alternatives to surgery may be available ( Dr. Williams book , How To Avoid Unnecessary Surgery , is a good starting place ) and , with your doctor , explore other treatment that may be equally or more effective . Like the majority of patients who undergo operations , your health and life , or those of a loved one , may someday be saved by surgery . You will then feel justifiably grateful for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which make such miracles possible . But enlightened patients need to understand that just as surgery can be performed for the right reasons with beneficial results , it can be and often is performed unnecessarily . That need not happen to your family .
