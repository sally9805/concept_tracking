txt Americans are likely to get a mixed bag of year-end presents from their government ? higher income taxes , but lower prices on gasoline and heating oil . Such is the current outlook , say top officials here , as President Ford and Congress wrestle their way toward deadlines on tax and energy policies for 1976 . As matters now stand , according to a senior U.S. official , the President will veto an extension of income tax cuts , because the bill about to emerge from Congress ignores Mr. Ford 's call for an equivalent reduction in federal spending . Such a veto ; unless overridden by Congress , means more withholding taxes will be taken from the pay envelopes of American workers beginning Jan. 1 , following the expiration of 1975 income tax cuts . The President , convinced of the need to reduce federal spending , is willing to take the political risk of raising taxes in an election year , according to a top presidential aide . Democratic leaders and some economists argue that higher taxes would impede the budding U.S. economic recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on goods and services . Failure of Congress to override a presidential tax-cut veto , said Sen. Russell B. Long ( D ) of Louisiana , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , could result in another half-million Americans losing their jobs next year . Senate leaders of both parties hope that Mr. Ford , if he does veto the bill , will do so quickly , allowing Congress to schedule an override vote before its Christmas recess . The argument of economic slowdown is rejected by Mr. Ford 's top economic advisers , including Treasury Secretary William E. Simon and Alan Greenspan , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , both of whom ? together with Budget Director James T. Lynn ? are urging the President to veto the tax-cut bill . The same three also are using Mr. Ford to veto a congressional energy bill , designed to retain price controls on U.S. oil for 40 months // * Higher taxes , cheaper fuel for New Year 's ? // and to reduce the average price of domestically reduced petroleum . Despite this advice , the President is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heed the advice of his energy chief , Frank G. Zarb , and sign the controversial bill . One result would be slightly lower retail prices for gasoline , fuel oil , and other petroleum products . Oil industry officials claim that lower prices would discourage exploration for new sources of U.S. oil and increase imports , already running close to 40 percent of total United States consumption . " If I were an Arab , " said an influential opponent of the bill , " I 'd lobby for the President to sign it . I call it the OPEC Act of 1975 . " The source referred to the fact that the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would benefit from the energy bill , if indeed it results in higher imports of oil into the United States . Already , experts note , the U.S. is importing steadily more oil from Arab wells , vulnerable to embargo in the event of renewed Arab-Israeli fighting , as Canada and Venezuela reduce their shipments to the United States . Mr. Ford himself argues for higher oil prices , not lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonetheless , according to one source , having instructed Mr. Zarb " to go up on the hill and work out a compromise , " the President appears ready to go along with his energy chief . Arguing within the Cabinet in favor of signing the energy bill are said to be , in addition to Mr. Zarb , Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and Commerce Secretary Rogers C. B. Morton .
