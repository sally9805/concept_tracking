 | married her , Ardis was like another one of them , the one with long red hair , Rita Hayworth , yes , she was made up to look like Rita Hayworth .... " The record had stopped and Leo found that he was speaking too loudly , in an odd , sharpened silence . " I do n't get into the movies much , " a man said slowly . " Reno , " the man with the bottle said . " In Reno there 's a lot of movie houses . In fact Rita Hayworth is in a movie there right now . " He spoke in a boyish , enthusiastic drawl , stretching his vowels . The bartender returned . Leo ordered another drink , to show that he was n't suspicious . " Hey , what are the police called out here ? ? mounties or rangers or something ? " he grinned . But the bartender only looked at him . Leo let his fist fall playfully onto the bar and said in his normal voice , " I bet women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . I bet they do n't dye their hair all colors . If any of you are married , I bet your wife is n't planning any strategy against you , huh ? Look : it was so bad I swear I could go to bed at night with a blonde and wake up with a redhead in the morning , it was almost that bad , I swear . How 's that ? " All the men laughed at this . Leo said delightedly , " She came back with a poodle cut once  --  all little curls , almost like a nigger 's hair , but ash-blond . Jesus ! Even her face could get rearranged . Sometimes she had double eyelashes on , sometimes a big red mouth , sometimes a pink or an orange mouth , sometimes her eyebrows were just pencil lines drawn on her face . . . . The skin could be rosy or white or tan , but like glass , without any pores .

Look : the world strikes me as a thing with holes in it  --  a what-d'ya-call-it , a a thing you strain spaghetti in  --  a thing in the kitchen for the water to run through ? " " A sieve , " the man beside him said . " Right . A sieve . The world is a sieve , a lot of little holes that things fall through , flow through like water , like blood . . . like  | blood bleeding out of your arteries while you stand there and watch , " Leo said . He was breathing now with difficulty . Something had begun to ache inside him but he was too excited to locate it . The men at the bar were looking at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear weak in front of them . " But my little girl . . . my little girl came out of it all , I mean the mess , the hatred . . . children can survive anything . . . . She never complains , she never cries . I never intended for her to grow up in any city like Pittsburgh . A child needs open spaces and sunshine and good , kind , healthy people , not sick people . Is n't that the truth ? " The men around Leo said nothing . At the far end of the bar someone Leo had n't noticed before , a puffy-faced man in a windbreaker , called out : " You left your wife , huh ? ? did you ? Walked out the door , did you ? " " Not exactly , " Leo said slowly . His face flushed . This was a serious moment and he felt that everyone was listening closely to him . His instinct was to tell the truth , always to tell the truth ; he did n't have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural in him . " She informed r one day to get out . So I did . And she had the locks on the doors changed . Did you know that is within the Law ? Her lawyer got a court order against me and I had to move out of town , I mean outside the city limits to satisfy them ... . The world is just filled with holes that surprise you every morning , " he said . The sorrow in his voice sank downward , down into his stomach and bowels . He felt suddenly tired , stricken . Almost sick . He tried to speak enthusiastically . " Let me order a round of drinks here . . . ! " The men did not respond . One of them shook his head slowly , as if embarrassed . The man in the windbreaker called out , " Hey , you 're from somewhere back East , are n't you ? Whereabouts back East ? " but Leo did not quite understand him . A sharp pain came and went in his body somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo said . " But it was just more papers , more lawyers . . . . In the same courtroom with me there was a man , a man , he went crazy and they put one of those things on him  --  a straitjacket with leather straps  --  but I was n't that man ? No , that was n't me , " he said quickly . He finished his drink . He had no taste for it but he believed he should finish it ; as  | he was putting the glass down something came up to meet him , the solid wood of the bar seemed to spread and go soft . Someone spoke in surprise . Leo felt the bottom of his jaw strike something , and then he felt someone 's hands on him . He pushed feebly away . " No thank you , I can manage on my own , " he said . " Give him a hand ? " " No thank you , " Leo said . A sudden thumping , a sharp pounding near me . The car door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blanket and said , Honey , are you asleep , he was crying , sobbing . Another man 's voice was behind him . But I could n't hear the other voice . I tried to wake up . My head came loose on my shoulders , my scalp went hot with itching , prickles like burrs , as soon as I woke up . The wind blew everything awake in me , the red-hot bites on my head and the dryness in my mouth . He was saying , Get the hell away ? I 'm not sick  --  I could n't hear the other voice . She is n't sick and I 'm not sick , he cried . Get the hell away from us or I 'll kill you , he cried . " Like this , honey . Hold it like this . " He held her hand in his and her fingers seemed to close around the crayon . But when he released her the crayon fell . " Such a nice coloring book and crayons , and you do n't take any interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting across from her at the table , having a drink while he watched her color . But she kept dropping the crayon . He had brought the coloring book and a large , trilevel box of expensive crayons all the way from Pittsburgh , one of Elena 's birthday presents ; but she did not seem to know what to do with them . " Pick it up , dear . Keep on coloring . You know I love to see you playing .... " Elena reached for the crayon but now it rolled off the table onto the floor . She squinted and moved slowly . The dye had left a gray shadow on her forehead and neck . Her hair was a very deep , slick black , but the sight of it no longer alarmed him so much .  | " Be a good girl , " he begged . He poured an inch or two more gin into the glass . Now that they were safe in San Francisco , he 'd sold the car and was ready to settle down permanently in this sunny rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to periods of sorrow . He did n't know why . Yes , he was satisfied , in fact he was very happy  --  he had Elena to himself now , with his own Safety-Guard lock on the door ? and yet he sometimes felt melancholy , almost depressed . " Elena , you should try to be a better girl , " he said . Sometimes he felt so nervous , so boxed in by the small room and noises from other tenants and the constant presence of his daughter , the constant thought of her , that he had to get out . So he stuck the pistol in his pocket and walked down to the waterfront . His clothes were like anyone else 's , yet people often glanced curiously at him . He stared back , showing that he was n't intimidated ; sometimes he even shot them small half-mocking half-inquisitive smiles . But more and more he found himself gravitating down to the wharf , where old men peddled seafood . They were so humble , so shifty-eyed , they were no threat to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In spite of the stench , Leo sometimes bought steamed clams or crabs and tried to eat them , believing that this would prove h- . sad a strong stomach and a good , healthy , normal appetite . Then he climbed the long hill to the rooming house and he felt how exposed he was , on the street like this , and what if he should be sick suddenly ? ? and call attention to himself ? Going down to the waterfront was all right , but returning to the rooming house frightened him . His entire body seemed to heat ; he felt an odd jumpy radiance about it and wondered if anyone could notice ... . He began to hate the bright baked sunlight of San Francisco , the blocks of uniform unattractive buildings , building after building , attached to one another with no alleys between , no place to run in case he was being followed . The streets were treeless and the constant sunlight made his eyes ache . On his way home he would stop to buy Elena something  --  another doll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he would carry triumphantly up to the room but end up eating himself , feigning pleasure in order to entice Elena to eat . She never ate more than a few mouthfuls of anything and if he forced her to eat  | she sometimes vomited it up again . In desperation he had tried everything : hamburgers , French fries , even steamed crabs , Chinese food , candy bars , oranges of the brightest , most enticing orange colors , but the only thing she liked was milk , which he brought back to the room in pint-sized waxed containers . He began putting a teaspoon or more of gin into the milk so that she would sleep easily and not be awakened by nightmares . He never let her out of the room . The woman who had rented him the room , on a weekly basis , did not know that Elena was with him ; therefore it was very important that Elena be quiet . " When I 'm out do n't walk around if you can help it , " he cautioned . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up before it scares you . . . . This is very serious , honey . You know it is . " But one day he noticed a louse on her neck and realized that he must wash her , must wash that head of snarled , matted black hair  --  and that did cause trouble , because soap ran into her eyes and she began to scream with pain . " Be quiet , Elena ! My God , be quiet ! " He panicked at the thought of the landlady calling the police . " Try to be quiet , Elena ! You 're going to make me lose my temper ? " Her cries dropped to sobs . He dabbed at her eyes with a washcloth , murmuring to her , comforting her . " I wo n't do it again , honey . I wo n't wash your hair again . It 's all right , honey . It 's all right . " So he gave up washing her hair . He gave up washing her ; she did n't really get dirty . After he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy more . He did n't get very dirty himself and he needed the money for milk and liquor , because his savings were running out . He gazed at his daughter and thought He thought One morning he finished a pint of gin sooner than he had expected , so he decided to go out . It had rained and now the sun was shining and everything was sharp , sleek , brilliant . He shivered . It was well into summer and still he felt cold . Going into a tavern near Fisherman 's Wharf , he stumbled but did n't fall . He liked the dark inside the tavern . On the street he felt too exposed . He could n't be sure if he was being followed or not , because the police sent after him would probably be plainclothesmen . He ordered  | a glass of draught beer and drank it down thirstily . Beside him was an elderly man who smelled of sweat and another odor , maybe fish . The man had a massive , bleary face that was turned toward Leo . Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he did n't yet know what it was . Elena had been sleeping when he left . Lying in the cot at the foot of his bed , in those rumpled soiled sheets , with her matted hair black on the pillow , her head looking heavy , too heavy to move . . . . He shivered again and patted his coat pocket , where he carried the gun . He was never without it now . He tried to think of Elena and what he had to do , but he could n't concentrate . He ordered another beer . The man beside him hissed a few words . " . . . What ? " Leo asked politely , nervously . " Mind your own business , " the man said . Leo stared at him . The man was not very old , but his face was a mass of veins , a ruin . He was grinning maliciously at Leo . " I am minding my own business , " Leo said . The man muttered something about the police , about police informers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer and walked out , steeling himself against the sunshine . But now it was raining ; he wondered if he had been in the tavern very long . His watch no longer worked . He stood in the doorway and rubbed his face , up and down , looking from one side to the other and trying to think ... trying to think ... . What would hurt his wife the most ? What would come close to destroying her ? After a few minutes he walked out into the rain and headed slowly back to the rooming house . He carried his right arm close to his body , so that with his elbow he could keep checking the gun . The beer had cleared his head somewhat but still he felt dizzy , strange . He could n't concentrate . He knew he was going to do something but he had n't yet imagined it , envisioned it . So much planning had gone into his rescue of Elena and the trip out West that now , now , now . . . there did n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he was older , more weary . He knew he was still strong and that his muscles could still perform , if he needed  | them , but he felt strangely tired . And his soiled , wrinkled clothing depressed him . The dirt beneath his fingernails depressed him . Then , at the corner of his street , he saw a sight that froze him . A police car was parked at the curb . Its red light was flashing but there was no siren , no noise . No police were around . Leo halted , frozen , while other people passed by him and seemed to melt into the rain , going invisible . He stared at the car and down the street to the high , narrow , ugly house in which he lived . He could force his way in  --  up the stairs and into the room  --  he could barricade himself and Elena in there  --  he had six bullets He could fight them to the finish But not today . Not this morning . He was approaching his fortyfifth birthday . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : If I ? If He fled . In a dime store be bought some notebook paper and a single business envelope and , now that the sun was out again , he went to a park nearby . To Whom It May Concern , he wrote . Then he ripped the page out and started again . To The Police Dept. , San Francisco ( &; Pittsburgh ) . He dated it June 27 , 1950 . Then he tried to think , tried to think . . . . He found that he was sitting on a park bench , gazing out at a pond . Ducks and swans were swimming there . On an island were many more ducks , large white ducks . Waddling and quacking . Very noisy . Two ducks lunged at each other , a third nipped at them , a single white feather drifted free . ... His head swam . Another drink : he would get another drink . But no , first he had to write a letter . He had to collect his thoughts and write a letter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive a person insane , he wrote angrily . No . He skipped a few lines and began again . The ballpoint pen he was using was almost out of ink . Ross Auto Sales , it said . He had always liked the rather fine , delicate point of the pen ; it made his handwriting look elegant . Suicide is a violation of the Law . The Law is very wise , though men do n't understand at first . The Law is like a wall . Throw yourself against it but it stands , it stands . A year ago I contemplated selfdestruction but did not give in , and gradually I recovered from  | my sickness and I now consider myself a free and healthy man . But I find I must put order into my life . My name is Leo Ross and you are searching for me . I have been here in San Francisco for some time , living in secret at ... . He paused . What was the name of his street ? He could n't remember . No , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rooming house was 1844 , but even that was n't clear .. . . His head whirled . A taste of beer rose into the back of his mouth . Names of cities , names of states ... the numbers of highways .. . the code of maps . . . A strange befuddlement overtook him . He read what he had written but still could not think of the name of his street . A few yards away , an elderly black woman was feeding the clucks bits of bread from a shopping bag . But the ducks were ignoring her . " Here y'are , " she coaxed . A boy of about six and his father were tossing out things for them , prepared snacks from a box , and the ducks showed more interest in these , but not much more . Much honking . Quacking . It was hard for Leo to concentrate . The little boy snatched the box from his father and threw it out onto the water angrily ; this drew several enormous white ducks , slapping their wings on the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box , slowing down stupidly , their heads turning from side to side . It flashed through Leo 's mind that he would like to shoot those ducks dead . He forced himself to reread his letter . Then he began again , painfully , leaving the name of the street blank ; he would check and fill it in later . I do hereby confess of my own free will that I transported my daughter , Elena Ross , from Pittsburgh , Pa. , to San Francisco , Calif. , with the express intention of hiding her from the local authorities and from the authorities of Pittsburgh , Pa. , in violation of a court judgment handed down against me on the 15th July , 1949 , Pittsburgh District Court , the Hon. Judge Norman Lucas presiding . I do hereby put my signature to this unsolicited confession in full cognizance of the legal rights I am surrendering and the implications of my statement . I do this , however , only upon the condition that my daughter be cared for in the proper manner and that she not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ex-Mrs . Leo Ross . The  | rest of this letter will explore in detail why the above-mentioned Mrs. Ross is an inadequate mother and must not be awarded custody again of ... . Now his mind flooded again : Ardis 's face , Ardis 's cheerful smile , her throaty sugary voice , her habit of humming as she strode everywhere . . . . She seemed to be striding into his head , swinging a door open and stepping inside . You poor silly bastard ! she laughed . He almost heard her , her voice . It was terrible . She opened a door and pushed it carelessly back and strode through the doorway , Ardis in her high-heeled shoes , Ardis with her contemptuous laugh .... Why did n't she die ? He tried to imagine her dead . But no , no . She would n't lie still in a coffin . No . She was too energetic , too beautiful . Her legs were too long , like swords . Oh , like swords , trim and swift . Oh , he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , mixing with the pain in his belly . Why did n't she die ? But she would never die . Easier to think of Elena dead . A small white coffin , a child 's coffin of the kind he had seen once , frightened to see it so polished and handsome and ready to use : with gold trim along the edge of the lid . Elena would be perfect in death . More beautiful than her mother , perfect , an angel , her skin like the petals of flowers that you must never touch . Only look at , never touch . He had touched her and now her skin was bruised , blotched , scabby . She had scratched at the reddened bites on her face and body and they had bled , the wounds had half-healed and started to itch again and she 'd scratched the scabs off , and mope blood , more blood ... . It did no good to scold her . To threaten her with tying her hands . No good . It did no good to search for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fleas . . . . They bit him too but he was able to ignore them , he had more control of himself , more contempt for the body .... If Elena died , the bites would go away and she would become a perfect child again , her hair light-blond again , almost white , the color of an angel 's hair . Her swollen eye would become normal again . Normal again her fingers , which were also puffy , swollen ... .  | Someone walked by the door but kept on walking . It was n't my father  --  not his footsteps . My head was very tired . I did n't move . He said not to walk across the floor but I did n't move , I was too tired ; when he came back he would ask me , Did you make any noise , and I would say No . I did n't know if it was morning now or the next day . I waited . He said not to answer if anybody knocked , but nobody knocked . The delicate bluish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Not staring at him . Closed permanently ? Suddenly Leo got to his feet . He needed a drink , he was desperate for a drink . He needed it now . The letter was finished , he could n't force himself to write any more , it was finished ; he folded it without bothering to reread it , stuck it in the envelope , and addressed it to San Francisco Police Dept . Now he needed a stamp . Just a single stamp . That was all that was between him and a drink . It got dark one day . I did n't know if he went out that morning or some other morning . Everything in my head was mixed together . I did n't move . If I lay still on the cot time ran together , it was all the same time , it did n't frighten me . What I was afraid of were loud noises : thumps from upstairs , people walking across the room upstairs . They were strangers . I thought they might break through the ceiling . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and their feet and legs would crash through the ceiling ? . It was loud upstairs but then it got quiet . The thumps always went away . Noises went away . Everything went away if you were careful . Leo bought a stamp at a stamp machine and put it on the envelope and mailed the letter at a corner mailbox . There , that was done . That was done . His life was completed . For a while he stood there , leaning against the mailbox . Bewildered , tender , shaky as a lover . What had he done ? Was his life coming to an end ? He thought about going for a drink but suddenly his legs were very weak . His whole body was weak . He had come to the end of himself , his life was at an end . The gun was still in his pocket and he could feel it weighing down that side of his body , putting him off balance . If he came back with something to eat I would smell the food and start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would say , You are a bad girl not to eat . So I did n't move . On the stairs there were  | people going up and down but not his footsteps . I did n't sleep . But I woke up and I was too tired to move . The bites were tiny red prickles on the surface of my skin , but now far away , melting away . I was too tired to scratch them . Then he would n't be angry if they did n't bleed . Sometimes there was a thunderstorm . I saw the lightning . But I could n't think about the lightning . I was n't afraid . Then it was light again , light coming under the shade . I could smell the spoiled milk . But I could n't get up to find it . I thought , If he has cotton candy I can eat that , you put your tongue on it and it melts , little dots of sugar , that 's all , it is easy to eat , you do n't have to swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't come back . I tried to tell him how the eating was bad , how it hurt me , but he would get angry . Once he held me in his arms and cried , like a little girl would cry . That frightened me . I tried to tell him how the eating was bad ... . " The eating was .... The eating was . . . . The eating was .... " No , that was later . At the Children 's Shelter . I tried to tell the nurse how the eating was bad and hurt me inside . But the words went around and around in my head and did n't come out right , out of my mouth . I could n't get them right . There were two streams of words : one in the head , where you can feel them like stones , hard little things , getting ready to be said out loud , and one in the throat and up into the back of the mouth and the mouth itself , on the tongue , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two streams of words come together at the back of your mouth , where you swallow , but sometimes they do n't . Then people stare at you . Then they laugh . The nurse said , " What ? What are you trying to tell me ? " The girl in the bed next to mine laughed . " They going to put you in the nut-house , " she laughed . Words in the head like little stones , but you ca n't touch them or get them out . Hard . They do n't dissolve . They hurt . Passing through the parts of the head they hurt , they swell up and get big . Words in the throat like crying , swallows of air . You swallow them by mistake . People laugh . My father did n't laugh but he got mad . He said , " You can talk right if you want to ? , " but then he would hold me and kiss me.  | I hid my face but could n't cry . The girl in the next bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughed the way she did , like a mirror . Then she liked me . When I laughed like her she liked me . She said she would be my friend . But that was later , at the Children 's Shelter . That was after the police and the woman came to get me . They knocked on the door but I did n't say anything . I was under the covers . They broke in and took the cot downstairs , holding onto me . They held me so I could n't fall off . I wanted to cry because my father would come back and I would be gone . He would be very angry . He would n't know where to find me . " I did n't know , I 'm not responsible . . . , " a woman was shouting . The first policeman got the door open . I knew it was n't my father . I was under the covers . My eye was shut but I could see them come in , it was n't my father . A man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . . . , " he said . They were policemen . A woman was with them , in a policeman 's uniform with a skirt . I could see through one eye how she stared at me . They were all staring . " My God . . . , " one of them said again . " Say hello ! Say something ! " A woman was standing over Elena . On the other side of the bed the ward nurse was propping up Elena 's pillow , helping her to sit up . Elena cringed and tried to close her eyes , but the woman kept talking to her , pleading with her . She had bright-red hair that seemed to grow outward around her head , in spiky curls . Something swung from her ears and was so strange , so glittering , that Elena tried to push herself backward , away from the danger of it , but the ward nurse gripped her shoulders and held her still . The woman 's mouth was red , very surprised and very agitated . " Elena ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance ; from up close , too close . The dis- tance had stretched and snapped and now it was collapsed to nothing , everything was close up , - face to face ; very loud . The red-haired woman leaned onto the bed , one knee onto the bed , making the mattress sink on that side . She was saying something but when Elena did not answer she lurched forward to embrace her , seizing her . EIena , EIena , came that weeping angry voice . Elena 's mouth was pressed against the woman 's shoulder , her skin hurt , all this agitation hurt her inside and out . But she did not fight . She did not cry . And then , as if to reward her , the woman leaned back and turned into Elena 's mother . Elena 's face felt as if it were being stretched open . " Look , she recognizes me ! She knows who I am ! " the woman exclaimed . " Oh , Elena , darling  --  Elena  --  it 's me , your mother , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oh , she recognizes me ! I told you she would recognize me ? " Elena noticed the dark-haired man who came in and out of the ward , a doctor , and the ward nurse , and another nurse . But her mother was in the center of everything she saw . Her mother leaned forward again and sat on the bed , near Elena , and took hold of Elena 's hands . She was very excited . She moved her face so that the bright flash of tears in her eyes was agitated ; a tear jerked out and ran quickly down her cheek . " My God , this is so terrible . . . what is that rash on your face , Elena , and what about your hair ? Jesus , oh Jesus . . . . What did he do to you ? What . . . . Why did n't you tell me what she looked like ? " she said to the doctor . He moved forward , summoned forward , quick and dark , his face shadowy . His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of it Elena 's mother embraced her again , weeping . Her dress was made of some rough , scratchy material , but at her throat a blouse showed through , a large lacy white bow . Earrings swung from her ears , large white stones like snowdrops . One of them was pressed against Elena 's forehead and she was grateful for its cold , hard , steady shape . " Why did n't you inform me of her condition ? Why did this take so long ? Do you people realize that this child has been missing for sixty-one days , sixty-one days without her mother , no , please , do n't interrupt , and I waited for forty-five minutes just to get in here ? Who is in charge here ? Why is n't she in a private room ? " The doctor tried to answer Elena 's mother .  | " What usual procedure ? What ?

" " She 's looking right at me , she knows me , look  --  she 's smiling at me  --  that is a smile ? Sweetheart , you 're going to be all right now . I 'll take you out of this place today .

You see , she understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were bright and fierce with tears .

She was always able to talk , Doctor , she was always a normal child . I ca n't understand why . . . . And why did the police take so long to find them ? And why did they let him escape ? " " How the police have handled it , that is not anything I know about , " the doctor said slowly . He was staring at Elena 's mother . His voice had changed ; it was not the way he spoke to the nurses , or called out orders , or asked questions in the ward . The nurse was also staring .

" When Elena did not answer , her mother 's smile saddened . She  | got to her feet and brushed off her dress , slowly , thoughtfully . She turned to the doctor without quite looking at him .

" " Well , you 're in charge here ? " " I am not the Director , no , of course , but I am in charge here today .... I am in charge , yes , Mrs. Ross , and will help you as much as I can . " " You 're very polite , you 're very human , " Elena 's mother said . " You can imagine what I 've gone through , all the telephone calls and the red tape and the police . . . and even getting an early flight out here . . . . Doctor , do you have pictures of Elena when she was first brought in ? " " Pictures ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-husband is apprehended . " " I am afraid we have no photographic evidence , but of course our reports are thorough  --  they are daily reports ? " " And eye-witness accounts , " Elena 's mother said . " This is n't a civil case now , I know , this is a criminal case , and it is n't up to me to gather evidence  --  but  --  we 'll see ? My attorney instructed me to never , never under any circumstances let other people take the lead if I could do it myself  --  sometimes evidence gets lost  --  it 's a mystery how important evidence can get lost ? And how on earth did they let that man escape ? That madman ? " " Mrs. Ross , I do not know , but ? " " She was a beautiful little girl , really beautiful  --  you would n't believe it ! I knew she was sick , suffering from malnutrition , but nobody bothered to tell me about her hair  --  imagine , dyeing a child 's hair black ! Black ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it shows the extent to which his mind was de- ranged  --  anyone with sense would have dyed it brown , or even red ? but black ! ? It breaks my heart to look at her  --  but you say she is much improved , Doctor ? You seem to be hopeful ? " " Oh , yes , certainly , " he said at once . " Certainly , Mrs. Ross . We were able to treat her before there was any permanent damage to the liver , and you can see that her color is good , very good  --  please do not be upset by the swellings and the bruises and the bites , those are temporary , the infections are well under control and the poison is out , that is not the serious thing , that was never the serious thing  --  what was dangerous was the dehydration , which we were able to treat at once ? And she was always a very good patient , a very good little girl  --  sometimes in these cases when the child suffers from malnutrition or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your little girl has always cooperated with the nurses , she has never resisted any treatment ? " " Oh , was she good ? Was she a good girl here ? " Elena 's mother asked . She smiled at Elena proudly . " Do you hear that , Elena , the doctor says you were very good ! Was she good ? " she asked the nurse . " Oh , yes , wonderful , just wonderful , " the nurse said . " And she did try to talk , she tries to talk sometimes , " the doctor said . " We are all certain , Mrs. Ross , that the use of speech will return to her naturally .... " " You 're very good , very encouraging to me , " Elena 's mother said . " It 's been such a shock . . . . Except one thing : my name is n't Mrs. Ross . My name is Ardis Carter , my legal name , my maiden name again . But my professional name is Bonita . Just Bonita . Just call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , Bonita . No last name . . . . Elena , sweetheart , are you listening ? The bad times are over now , the nightmare is over . I 'm taking you home and you 'll be under the best possible medical care , you 're going to be well as soon as possible , and happy , and going to school again , and playing again . . . . Is n't that wonderful ? And you 'll be safe with your mother again , and nothing will ever happen to you again , do you understand ? Why do n't you say something , Elena ? " Elena stared up at her mother . It was fascinating , it was like going into another kind of sleep , to see her mother 's bright beau- tiful face again , to watch her red lips parting over her white teeth into a smile . Elena 's own lips parted , her mouth opened . But it was very dry . At the back of her mouth there was a dry circle , like a bubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey  --  she was as worried as I was , all these weeks  --  you can imagine how worried they were at school , " Elena 's mother said , half turning to the doctor , " especially that woman who allowed the kidnaping to take place ? You know , all this could have been prevented , my daughter could be in perfect health at this moment , if only that woman had been doing her duty and watching the playground ? Believe me , her troubles are just beginning . And my husband , if he 's ever caught ? How could the police have let him escape ? The wire services have had his photograph for two months ! But I would n't be surprised if he was right in the city here , maybe spying on this place . He is n't crazy , but he pretends to be  --  he has the shrewdness of a crazy man ? can you imagine what it was like for my daughter to be kidnaped by him ? It 's no wonder she ca n't talk . But they told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the federal kidnaping charges . . . the kind that were passed after that poor Lindbergh baby was kidnaped .... " " You mean with the death sentence . . . ? " the doctor asked . " Yes . They told me it probably could n't be brought against him , an indictment like that , " Elena 's mother said , " because he was her father and did n't demand ransom or anything like that . . . . But he did cross state lines , I told them . But they said . . . . Oh , hell , the law is too much for a woman to figure out . . . . Elena , honey , you 're so thin ! It 's going to take a lot of love to make you well again , is n't it ? Give your mother a nice kiss . " She leaned down again , presented the side of her face ; Elena kissed her cheek . " My sweet little girl , " Elena 's mother murmured , " you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say hello to me ? I bet you can . I bet you can if you try . " " If she was not hurried . . . , " the doctor began . " Elena , what do you say ? Hello to your mother ? " Elena felt the gap at the back of her mouth swell to the point of pain . It was like a stone swelling . The dry parched muscles tried to work , to move , to give shape to something . Elena 's mother was  | staring , smiling , eyes into eyes , bluish-gray eyes into Elena 's eyes , which had begun to strain now with her effort to speak . " I 'll think you do n't want me here , " Elena 's mother said with a little downward twist of her mouth . " I 'll think I made the trip just for nothing . . . that you want me to go back home by myself and leave you here . . . . " Elena clutched at her mother 's arm . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged . " Do you love your mother ? My beautiful little girl ! Do you love your mother ? " " I ? " Elena began . " Yes , yes , do you ? Do you ? " Elena felt the air at the back of her mouth almost gagging her . " I ? I love you ? " Elena gasped . Her mother stared at her . For a moment no one spoke . Then , very quietly , almost in a whisper , Elena 's mother said : " Tell us again , honey . . . ? Can you . . . ? " " I love you , " Elena said . And the world became perfect again . I said , I 'm ashamed of the basement . She stared at me . A dot seemed to get smaller in her eyes ; she held me there with her eyes , staring . I said the wrong words . I stammered and said again , I 'm ashamed of the basement , and started to cry and they laughed at me . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did they laugh at you , she asked . Because I talked wrong . How did you talk wrong , she asked . I said ashamed and Miss Frye stopped me and said , what do you mean , Elena ? ? do you mean afraid ? Then you should say afraid . But they were all laughing at me . Why could n't you say afraid , my mother asked .  | I do n't know . I do n't want those little sons of bitches laughing at you , my mother said . I 'm not going to stand for that . " Why are you afraid of the locker room , Elena ? " Miss Frye asked . " The dark .... " " What do you mean , the dark ? It is n't dark down there on gym days , is it ? " " No , but .... " " The lights are on when the girls go down , are n't they ? Of course they are . There 's nothing to be afraid of . " Elena agreed . " When the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basement or even look down there , " Miss Frye said with a perplexed smile . " So there 's no reason to be afraid , is there ? The other girls are n't afraid . Just march downstairs and keep your place in line and nothing will happen . . . . You 're not going to be afraid again tomorrow , are you ? " Elena agreed . Then she realized she had said the wrong thing . She said quickly , " No . " What is it you see in the dark , she asked me . I could n't answer . I did n't know . They lived only three blocks from the John P. Salisbury School , in Cleveland , Ohio , so that Elena could come home to lunch every day . She could even walk in a small group with other girls who lived in the neighborhood . By twelve-fifteen Ardis was always awake and out of bed , though not always dressed . She would open the door for Elena and greet her happily : she would be wearing one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slacks with Oriental designs on them , her hair often swinging free from having just been shampooed , her face clean of make-up and shining , almost glaring . She often said , " Look who 's dropping in for lunch ! " She was very cheerful in the kitchen , teaching Elena how to make little meals  --  lunch for Elena , breakfast for Ardis  --  of scrambled eggs with grated cheese and paprika , or vegetable soup with fresh mushrooms sliced into it , or strong cheddar cheese melted on very thin pieces of whole wheat bread . She taught Elena to make tossed salads , holding Elena 's hands as she held the large wooden spoon and fork . In the evenings , she instructed Elena in the prepa- ration of thick , elaborate stews , the braising of fish or meat seasoned with onion and paprika ; she had bought a Hungarian cookbook and gradually shifted the task of learning the recipes onto Elena , who was very eager to help . " Mr. Karman 's wife could n't do better than this , I bet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elena was cooking . Mr. Karman came to the apartment every day , bringing food : not just meat and vegetables but sour cream , goose fat , caviar , noodles in strange shapes , whole fishes , red cabbage , sweet red peppers . . . . Sometimes he helped Elena with her homework while Ardis went out on brief shopping trips to the drugstore or stopped by at a friend 's house to pick something up . He did n't know about Elena 's troubles at school and was always pleased when she showed him her test papers with their high grades . " You are such a sweet little girl , and smart also , like your mother , " he said . Elena could feel him searching for and testing words , as if afraid of drawing out the wrong words , afraid of being laughed at . Elena was nine years old . She was in the fourth grade at the Salisbury school , and she and her mother lived in one of the apartment buildings owned by Mr. Kai-man ; that was how they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Elena did n't know what it was , and one day Mr. Karman had stopped by to talk to her . He was a large , kindly man , with a perpetual doggish smile . He was always smiling at Ardis . It gave him pleasure to call her th Ardis and Bonita , switching from name to name as if he were in charge of a secret , an intimate code . " Are you happy here ? " Mr. Karman asked her . " This apartment is beautiful and of course we 're happy , we 're very grateful , " Ardis said . " You are happy here too ? " he asked Elena . Yes , Elena said . They had moved up to the top floor , to what was called the penthouse . The apartment was large , wide , sunny , with old-fashioned velvet drapes and heavily ornamental furniture and a marble-andbrass fireplace that was not real . Ardis had put her own things up on the walls  --  photographs of herself , glossy shots that showed her face from every angle framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elena . Sometimes Ardis would stride through the rooms  | and cry out happily , " Who are those people ? Those faces ? Who 's so lucky ? " She was usually in a good mood , in spite of the trouble Elena sometimes had at school . Her red hair had been softened , lightened , to a pale and almost iridescent orange , a tawny orange that changed hues in different lights . She and Elena both had several white outfits : coats and hats and matching dresses . She had a lime-green suede outfit , a vest and jodhpurs . She and Elena both had fur coats , not mink but muskrat , but very fine skins , so that people stared at them on the street and could not think of any appropriate expression into which to shift their faces . At such times Ardis smiled coolly and looked away . If anyone approached her or spoke to her ? any man  --  she sometimes stared at him with her cold bluish-gray eyes and her mocking smile and said softly , " Who the hell are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , wordless . Elena was very happy there , very happy . On schooldays she woke at eight o'clock , when the alarm clock made a little clicking noise ? it was set for that time but the alarm mechanism was n't pulled , because Ardis did n't want to be awakened so early . In the bathroom she washed and fixed her hair , quietly , very quietly , standing on her toes to peer over the bottles and jars on the ledge that ran along the bottom of the mirror , then she dressed herself , except for her shoes , and went out into the kitchen to have a bowl of cereal or a sugar doughnut or an apple . It was important always to eat breakfast , her mother told her . And Mr. Karman , concerned for her health , insisting that both she and her mother were too thin , would always question her about breakfast . " And you had eggs and sausage ? And buttered rolls ? " he would ask . Yes , Elena would say . When they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do n't want to confuse him , " and she laughed and said , " If I do n't get ten hours of sleep I could n't last through one of those conversations with him , honey , and then what ? The most important thing in life is sleep , " she said meditatively , stroking her face . " Absolute unconsciousness . " So in the mornings Elena would eat alone and then gather up her books and shoes and go out into the corridor , which was thickly  | carpeted . The railings were always polished ; doorknobs and hinges were polished ; the entire door of the little closet-sized elevator gleamed . But Elena took the stairs five flights down , because the elevator frightened her . And from the front steps she had only a five-minute walk to school , in daylight , so there was nothing to be afraid of , nothing . " Just think of me upstairs , watching you over the ledge , if you get afraid , " Ardis said . " And think of all the other little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was very happy when she came home at noon and could hear the radio already on . That meant her mother was up and in a good mood . They would make their meal and eat in the dining room , which looked out and down onto a courtyard below . If it was a lucky day the telephone would n't ring . But on most days it began to ring around twelve-thirty , and Ardis would eat her breakfast with the telephone receiver stuck under her chin , murmuring , " Yes . Fine . When ? Sure . I 'll check and call you back . . . . Oh , sure . Great . Whose car ? Long or short hair ? No , not him . Not him . I do n't mean him , but the other one , yes , him , count me out if ... . What about Elena ? What about Saturday ? Great . " Elena ate her lunch slowly , sadly . It did no good that her mother winked at her and seemed to be making fun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half there , half with Elena and half with someone on the other side of town . If she said , What about Elena ? there was a terrible pause , a terrible wait . And then , if she said Great , Elena 's heart sank . She blinked to keep tears out of her eyes and tried to keep up with her mother 's chatter , the buoyancy of her mood , she tried to look happy when Ardis said in triumph , " Got you a little work , honey , for that private bank account of yours ! ? you 're really on your way ! " But sometimes she could n't look happy enough . And her mother would hesitate and say , " Elena , what 's wrong . . . ? Are you sick ? " No . " Well , what are you looking so gloomy about then ? What are you thinking ? " Nothing . " Yes , you are , honey , you 're certainly thinking something  --  is it a secret , is it something I should know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it something you should n't be thinking , Elena ? Confess . " Nothing ... . " You have a closed-up little face sometimes , like one of those flowers , a narcissus , a very selfish flower , " Ardis said thoughtfully . " You 'd better tell me what 's wrong before you go back to school . I ca n't let you walk out of here with that look on your face . " Elena would stare at the food on her plate . " You must understand how valuable work is , work of the kind we do , " Ardis said . " Thousands of women . . . thousands , millions of little girls are envious of us . Do you know that ? What are you thinking ? " She would lean forward to peer at Elena , as if looking into her head . Half joking , but also serious , she would raise - her eyebrows with the effort of staring right into Elena 's head . " I can read your thoughts , I can hear everything you 're thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tune . You 'd better wise up . There wo n't always be a mother to pay for your food and take care of you ? what do you think this world is ? It is n't a nursery ! " Arranged around the living room , on the walls and propped up on the fake mantel and on the tables , stuck in odd corners , were photographs of Ardis modeling : long and elegant , with a head that appeared tiny or fluffed out , a boy 's head , or the head of a woman with waist-length curls ; Ardis stretching to reach a flower almost beyond her grasp , tantalizingly ; Ardis comically sharing a long piece of straw with a horse ; Ardis seated at a wrought-iron table , demure , ladylike , prim in an organdy dress and medium-heeled white shoes , holding an enormous wide-brimmed white hat . But the photograph on the mantel was the most important one , the one that had brought her the most money and a great deal of local attention  --  Ardis and Elena both , Ardis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossy , her eyes shimmering with mischievous health , stooping to embrace her child , Elena , a small perfect child who stared right into the camera with slightly surprised eyes and a tentative shy smile . They wore mother-anddaughter outfits , polka-dot dresses and white gloves , their hair exactly the same shade of blond  --  Ardis had worn a wig for the sitting , a wig of the same hue as her natural hair  --  and the skin identical . The advertisement was for skin cream ; the caption said  | in accusing black letters , COULD YOU HOPE TO COMPETE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER 'S SKIN ? That was the photograph Mr. Karman cherished . The first time he 'd seen it , the first time he had come to the apartment , he had picked it up and stared at it and brought it over to a window to stare , to murmur softly , " Lovely . . . . Lovely .... " Ardis had admitted , " Yes , I 'm pleased with that one myself . " " The mother  --  the daughter . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and daughter , truly , and not just models , not just strangers posing for a camera , " he said . He looked at the photograph for a while . His profile was severe and reverential . " It is amazing , a miracle , " he said oddly , " how the flesh can be arranged on the bones . . . certain angles and patches of skin . . . and the effect is one of such beauty . . . it is such uncanny beauty that almost one does not want to look into it . " Ardis said nothing . " Knowledge of such matters does not help , " Mr. Karman said . " It is not powerful enough to help .... " Sit still . Like that . Do n't move . Do n't blink . Be good , be a good girl . Yes . Perfect . Ardis bragged to the photographers and their assistants and the other models that Elena had been born with a natural gift , that she could sit under those hot lights for half an hour , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even sniffing , hardly breathing ; she was a little doll . " You really are a little doll , " people agreed . Men propped her up onto stools , tilted her face , shaped a smile with their fingers , left the smile , came back to it in a few minutes and reworked it , bringing their serious , frowning faces close to hers and yet not close at all . She felt them but did not really feel them . There was a distance between them ; she was not threatened . Even the lights did not burn her eyes . A Iittle doll . Once , after a long session that lasted until late in the day , a man took Ardis and Elena downstairs to a restaurant of some kind , a ( lark place , and Elena could n't see . She stumbled into something . She kept blinking , her eyes began to water helplessly , she was very ashamed . " Is something wrong with you ? " Ardis asked suddenly .  | She and the man both paused to look down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man said . " It 's all right , " Elena said . They were sitting in a booth somewhere . It was very dark , soft . Around the big cave-like room lights were glowing but they were soft , watery , indistinct . " Why are you blinking like that ? " Ardis asked . " Her eyes must be sore , " said the man . Elena did not answer . She waited . In a few minutes her mother would forget , would turn away ; she could rely on that . But for some reason Ardis slid her arm around Elena 's shoulders , gently , and examined her eyes . It was very embarrassing because the man , a stranger , was watching . " Now , tell the truth , honey . Can you see all right ? " " I do n't know . " " Do your eyes burn ? " " A little . " She did not try to squirm away from her mother , though she wanted to . She wanted to tell both her mother and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . She hated them to look at her so directly . " Elena , you should have said something up in the studio , if the lights were shining in your eyes , " Ardis said . Elena did not know how to reply . She sensed something unusual in her mother 's voice , a tone Ardis would n't use if they were alone ; she would n't have used it either , with Mr. Karman ; it had something to do with this man . So Elena did not know what her mother wanted her . to say . " As soon as you felt your eyes begin to burn , you should have told me , " Ardis said . " I 'm sorry , " Elena said . " You 're a very good little girl to sit so still , " Ardis said , " but if this happens again you should tell me . . . . Unless . . . unless you did it to be bad , to get out of work tomorrow . . . . Was that the reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes water and get red and ugly , so you would n't have to work tomorrow . . . ? Elena , tell the truth . Was that it ? " " No , " Elena said miserably . Ardis looked at the man . She let both hands fall limply on the table . " Sometimes I ca n't handle her , I ca n't figure her out . She 's  | very secretive for a girl her age . I think she pretends to be very stupid just to get out of work . Elena , honey , you 'd better tell the truth . Could you really be that stupid , to stare into the lights for an hour and not say anything ? Do you expect me to believe that ? " Elena was going to say she was sorry ; but she could not form the words . " Well ? " Ardis asked . " Do you expect me to believe that a girl your age could let herself practically be blinded and not say anything ? Do you ? My God , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame . After a while Ardis began to tell the man about her problems with Elena at school ? " I do n't know what will become of her " ? and the difficulties she had , a divorced mother , a woman with a lifelong responsibility to a child , whose husband had deserted her and paid no alimony at all ? " He 's a common criminal wanted in half a dozen states , quite a handicap for even a normal child to grow up with " ? Then , after a while , as the man soothed her , Ardis 's voice began to grow tender ; Elena sensed an important change . Ardis said , " But . . . well . . . I ca n't complain , can I ? She really is a little doll . She 's so sweet . Have you ever seen any model her age so professional ? She 's like a little adult , is n't she ? ? It 's wonderful how she tries not to show her feelings or to cry , even if she 's hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if she feels pain the way other children do .... " A man said to her , all you need is a gold frame around you . And the laughed , she laughed . She said , and no way out ... ? And no way out , the man said . But she laughed . Mr. Karman clasped his hands in front of him and said how serious it was ; life was serious ; everyone , especially a child , needed a stable life . Ardis laughed . " But I am serious with you , " he protested . " I am not speaking casually . . . . You must think of your little girl , even if you do not think about yourself . " " Think of her ! " Ardis exclaimed . " As if I ever think of anything Cse ?  | Mr. Karman sat with Elena while Ardis dressed in the other room , with the door ajar so that she could call out to him . He looked smilingly through her school workbooks , he pulled out of his pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny poppyseed cakes , things Elena took to school with her and gave away the next morning . Once he gave her a mother-of-pearl ring and she gave that away , to the loud , cheerful , pony-tailed girl who sat behind her , and who was too surprised to say thank you . " Yes , Ardis , you must try to stabilize this existence , for the sake of your child and of yourself , " Mr. Karman called out . He never looked toward the bedroom , toward the half-opened door , even when Ardis did n't reply to his remarks . " For instance , yesterday , it was yesterday I tried to telephone you and you were never home . . . . " " Yesterday I took Elena to the doctor , " Ardis called . " What ? A doctor ? Why ? " " She 's so frail and susceptible to colds , you know that , she may never be completely normal again .... " " What ? Is she sick ? " Mr. Karman asked . He looked severely at Elena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , I do n't know , " Ardis called from the other room , her voice muffled . " It was a specialist  --  it 's always the same story , they want money , all they care about is money ? " " Did you take her to Dr. Renfrew ? The doctor I told you about ? " " Oh , I do n't know , they all want so much money , " Ardis said . " But Ardis , Ardis , just tell me how much ? " After a while Ardis appeared , her hair not fastened into place , her hand at her throat . She stared at Mr. Karman . " I do n't like to burden you with my private problems , " she said . He rose and took her hands , he led her forward . He said , " If you would only tell me , Ardis  --  please ? " They began to talk about money . Elena had heard this before , she knew how her mother would sigh , would glance nervously around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , looking right into her face , smiling . " But you have your own family , " Ardis said . " My family ! Grown-up children who have no need of me , and a wife  --  a wife  --  well , I will not talk of her , but she has no need of me either , not as you do . "  | He was a heavy-set man with enormous sloping shoulders . His hair was scruffy and graying , his eyebrows thick , ridged , melancholy . Sometimes he stared at Ardis , bearish , perspiring , not daring to touch her , his eyes filmy , watery , golden-glowing , very tender . Iie said gently , " Ardis , what other happiness is there for a man ? Except to raise someone higher than himself , to love and honor someone higher than himself . . . ? " Sometimes they talked about leaving Cleveland together , with Elena . And Elena 's heart leaped . But always , at once , Ardis would say : " No , I ca n't . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you say that ? That is a torment to me ! " " I could n't do it . " " Ardis , my wife and I are not close . No . Not for many years . As many years as you are old , Ardis , think of that . . . . Do you know what that means , to live without love for so long ? Without beauty ? There is no goodness , no worth to life , unless a man can raise the world into the beautiful and the immutable ; you wo n't deny me that ? " The beautiful and the immutable . Elena loved him . But Ardis said , " If I broke up your family I could n't live with myself .... " He talked to her . He kept talking . He laughed , in his bewilderment , his frustration , his hope . He talked about his childhood and young manhood in Budapest ; he talked about his belief in saints and angels . " We were not so poor as some , but we were poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . but my mother was very religious , and she taught me to believe as strongly as she did , because it was a help for her and she knew it would help me , even if I could n't hold onto it when I got older . . . but I loved the statues , the saints and the angels , I loved how beautiful they were . . . and how still , how perfect , they never asked anything or judged harshly . . . . You arc both like angels to me , " he said in his slow , guttural voice , a voice of wonder . " I dream of you , Ardis , but also of your daughter ... the two of you together . . . who must be protected , cherished . You must let me help you , Ardis , you must bring your hectic life into order . " Ardis did not reply for a while . Then she said slowly , " I know that 's true . But I do n't know how to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? You know how I am anxious to help you . . . ? " " I 'm in debt . Medical bills for Elena , even dental bills . . . and they want me to start some kind of speech therapy , the teachers at Elena 's school . . . . A child is a responsibility you 're never free of . I got married when I was so young , I was a mother when I was so young . . " How much are you in debt , Ardis ? " She shook her head . " No . I ca n't take money from you . The gifts are different , the apartment here . . . no , I 'm quite sincere , I will never take money from you . It 's pointless to talk about it . . . . Did I tell you I took Elena downtown for x-rays ? And while she was being x-rayed , right at that moment , I happened to read in the Reader 's Digest out in the waiting room about how x-rays might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bone . . . the marrow of the bone . . . . Is n't that terrible ? I almost went into a state of panic . And Elena is already so highstrung , so sensitive , she is n't like other children who are blunt and brutal and do n't feel pain .... " " Ardis , we must talk more about this . We must . We must put all our lives into order . " My mother came to get me because I was in the nurse 's room and could n't talk , they had to telephone her and she was angry . I could n't move . I felt the vibrations of her walking in the corridor and I was afraid . Her hat around her head was tight , filmy white feathers that moved and seemed to breathe by themselves . Her coat was orange with dark blue stripes . Her face was painted pink . She cut through what Miss Frye was saying and said , what is down in that basement ? It is n't a basement , it 's the locker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gymnasium , Mrs. Carter . On Tuesday and Thursday mornings the girls have gym , they change into their gym clothes in the locker room and for some reason your daughter is afraid and My mother looked at me . Elena , you tell us , she said . But I could n't talk .  | Her face flamed up . You , Elena , you , you tell us  --  she cried  --  you tell us  --  you They had put me down on the nurse 's cot and there was a white cotton blanket up over me , a thin blanket . Miss Frye and the nurse and the principal herself carried me . They were very surprised . Sometimes a girl or a boy from my room would get a nosebleed and leave the room , sometimes someone would get sick to his stomach and come in here , but now I was in here . I wanted to get well and talk . Damn you , my mother said , I wo n't put up with your tricks , she said , you have some explaining to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure exactly what happened  --  Elena must have said something , or stuttered , and the girls were laughing at her  --  and then she just stood there , she seemed to become paralyzed . I 've never had anything like this happen before and I Are you the principal ? You 're the principal ? And you allow this kind of thing , this intimidation of a child , forcing her to go down into some damn basement and harassing her ? ? a minor ? ? do you know I could bring suit against the Board of Education and against you personally , are you aware of the risks you are taking in this ignorant haphazard  --  ignorant  --  asinine  --  this incompetent manner you are administrating  --  administering your duties ? Mrs. Carter My daughter was perfectly normal before she enrolled in this school and now look , my mother cried , now look But She pulled the blanket off me and yanked me up . And I came awake , I felt my legs coming awake . She said , Elena ? ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are perfectly normal and always have been , my mother said , but on the way home when we were walking she said , you 're not normal and I wo n't stand for it . You 're doing it to spite rue . You want me to interrupt my work and run over to that goddam school and make a fool of myself in front of those ugly old bags I started to cry . Oh go ahead and cry and ruin your face , my mother said , but v ni have some explaining to do when we get home . 6o Do With Me What You Will  | I said they were going to turn the lights out , they told me they were going to turn them out What lights ? To scare me because they knew I was afraid  --  they said  --  they said the boys were hiding down there and What boys ? What lights ? What the hell is all this ? I was afraid of the basement and they always laughed at me and Then why did you pretend you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have polio ? I could get rid of you , put an ad in the paper and get rid of you , I could give you back to your father ? the two of you probably have planned all this , to drive me crazy I was crying . I said , Then on the step I  --  on the step five steps from the bottom I  --  I could n't Oh shut up , this is driving me crazy . I do n't believe any of this . I did n't want to Oh shut up , she said , and put her hands over her ears , over the fluffy white feathers . Up in the apartment she picked up a picture of me , sitting in a playsuit by a Christmas tree with lots of dolls around me and she said , I 'll put this in the paper and say that a bad girl is for sale , a bargain at twenty dollars ! But you 're too old to sell , nobody wants idiots your age  --  if you were just a baby yet I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late now She ripped the photograph in two . She said , Wait until I tell him about this . Ardis whipped off the hat with the white feathers and threw it down . She telephoned Mr. Karman at his office . Her face was stern and she would n't look at Elena , who was still crying . " That 's so kind of you , to come over right away , " she said . " My life lurches from one crisis to another . . . . " When she hung up she hurried into her bedroom , still ignoring Elena . Elena sat on the edge of the sofa . In a few minutes her mother reappeared , and her hair was a pale , pale blond , cut very simply and elegantly around her face , and she was buttoning up a white satin blouse . She walked toward Elena but did not see her . She lit a cigarette . She was breathing hard , in short eager pants , holding her torso a little high , her breasts unnaturally raised . Her skirt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her but she did not look at Elena .  | When Mr. Karman came , Ardis took him by the arm and said , " There 's no one here to eavesdrop , but let 's go into the other room anyway , " and he glanced guiltily at Elena , sad , stricken himself , as if he and not Elena had made a terrible mistake . Elena sniffed hesitantly , questioningly . But the door to the bedroom closed . She waited . When her mother and Mr. Karman came out again , after a while , Elena did n't know how long , Ardis was crying and Mr. Karman looked as if he too had been crying , his face somber and strained and red . He came to Elena . He said , " Elena , your mother and I have at last made some vital decisions . At last your mother will listen to me , and we will seize happiness out of this troubled time in all our lives . . . . " Elena , very anxious to understand , to hear everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Ardis was looking out of the window . Mr. Karman was saying something about a stable life , about marriage , about a single household , and Elena listened in terror and heard him say , " ? but my religion forbids such normal desires  --  my wife  --  it is too complicated for a child to understand  --  but the tragedy is not permanent because a normal family life can be established even without the marriage bond  --  a normal life of routine , which you require so desperately but which circumstances have denied you  --  Elena  --  and so ? " She listened . She blinked up at him , into his flushed , heavy face , smelling his clothes and the eagerness of his love . He was telling her about a clinic in Chicago , " the finest in the country  --  and I have made inquiries everywhere , because no expense is too great ? Elena , my dear , you and your mother will bear my name , your mother will change her name legally to mine  --  it will be exactly like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has at last agreed to this , Elena . You 're going to Chicago and I will join you shortly and we will all live together , Elena , in a house  --  in a real house  --  and you will have the best medical attention that is pos-sible ? " Ardis was watching now . She stood with her arms folded , at the window ; her white satin blouse gleamed . " You are happy with this , Elena ? You are happy , at last . . . ? " Mr. Karman asked . Ardis came to the sofa now and knelt beside Elena and embraced her . For a moment she said nothing . Elena could feel her  | heartbeat . Then Ardis said , almost laughing , as if delirious with relief , " Oh , the baby ! Who 's a darling little baby with all her bad dreams ending ? Who 's going to have a real father , a real father and a real house ? And the best school in the world , so you wo n't ever stammer again and wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to move into a real house , Elena , and Mr. Karman will join us in a week ? " " A week is too short , " Mr. Karman laughed , " I wish it could be a week  --  but  --  soon , very soon we will be together ? " Elena 's face opened into a smile . Ardis laughed delightedly . She tried to hug and lift Elena , but Elena was too heavy . Elena looked from her mother to Mr. Karman and back to her mother again and saw that everything had changed , that everything was different ; now she smiled , smiled , and her mother smiled so that her face was beautiful again . Everything had changed . " I want to change my name to yours , " Ardis said to Mr. Karman fiercely . " Yes . It is n't just a gesture . I want Elena and myself to have your name , yes . And then someday I want to be your wife , I want to belong to you . " " Thank you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my old life , " Ardis said , moving her arm so that the entire living room was included : the photographs , castoff items of apparel  --  the white feathered hat , a single red leather glove with a half-moon cut out at the knuckles , which lay on the arm of a chair as if it were a real hand , a long golden chain that was either a necklace or a belt , lying on the window sill . " I 'm an adult woman , a mother ; I 'm responsible for another human being . When I model clothes at the department stores , at the fashionshow luncheons , I look out with such envy at the women there ? so refined , so good , well-mannered , real ladies  --  and I think of how I want to be like them , to get free of my past life ? I want to be good . I want to change my life . " " You will change your life . It will all change , " Mr. Karman said . " Just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Elena needs it , but I need it too , almost as badly . I 've been deceiving myself for years . I need stability , protection , I need to feel safe from . . . from him .... "  | " Him ? But he has n't contacted you , has he ? Has n't threatened you ? " " No . But I keep waiting for it .... " " Ardis , that man would never dare come back . Never . The police ? " " They 'd arrest him , yes , but he could do harm to me before that , " she said slowly . " Oh , I know it 's absurd , but I keep seeing him  --  I mean , I think I see him  --  on the street , the other day driving a taxi , a man who looked exactly like him ? " " You 're just very sensitive , Ardis , and you 're going through a difficult time . Please do n't think about him . He would never come back , never  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be coming to live with you ? " " Thank God , " Ardis said . One day they went downtown to a courthouse , and Ardis and Elena had their names changed . Now they were Ardis Karman and Elena Karman . Elena saw the document herself . " What 's your name , honey ? " Ardis asked . " Elena Karman . " They went out to lunch then at a restaurant . " Do you really want . . . ? To be seen in public with me . . . ? " Ardis asked shyly . " Yes . I have had enough of secrecy , " Mr. Karman said . Ardis was very excited . She talked about the problems of moving ? all the boxes , the crates , the reservations at the Chicago hotel ? she talked about how nice they had been at the courthouse  --  about the houses she was going to be shown in Chicago , which Mr. Karman had arranged ? " in a lovely suburb of Chicago , right on the lake ! " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she said , " Are n't you proud of your little daughter ? She really is beautiful , is n't she ? With her hair cut and curled like that , her face is like a buttercup , the way her hair cups it  --  is n't she lovely ? ? do you think the other men in this restaurant are jealous of you , look how they 're staring ! ? because you own us both , after all ? Some of these men know you , do n't they ? What do you suppose they 're thinking ? " " I do n't care what anyone thinks now , " Mr. Karman said . lle handed Ardis an envelope and Ardis smiled at him as if in a trance , her eyes fixed upon his face . " Thank you . . . , " she said .  | She groped for her purse , not looking down , brought her purse into her lap and opened it and put the envelope inside . " Thank you , " she said . She glanced at Elena . Elena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as you get to the hotel , " Mr. Karman said . " And drive carefully , Ardis . Very carefully . " " I 'm a perfect driver , " Ardis said . She held out her hands to show how steady they were . " It 's so late in the afternoon , I almost wish you would wait until tomorrow ? " " Oh no , no ! I could n't wait , I could n't bear to wait another day ! " Ardis said . " I 'll drive very carefully . . . . Do you love us ? Both of us ? " Mr. Karman was leaning in the car window . He looked both haggard and happy . " Of course I love you and . . . and I will miss you , even for this short while . . . but I will fly up next weekend just to visit , and look at houses with you , and . . . and . . . . Elena , you will help your mother with the map ? You will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched on the radio and began humming along with a song . That morning she had shampooed her pale orange hair and it was very fresh , very shiny . Like Elena , she wore clothes for traveling  --  wool slacks and a pullover sweater . Elena was so excited she stammered when she talked about the map , and Ardis laughed gently and patted her hand . Mr. Karman had given Elena a book of maps for the entire United States , and he and she had plotted out the simple route Ardis would take to Chicago . " Just for fun , " Ardis said , " look up the map of New York State . " " New York ? " Elena leafed through the book , to the N 's . " Here it is . " " Do you know anything about New York City ? " Ardis asked . " No . " " Well , you will . " Elena looked at her mother . " What ? Why . . . ? " " Because that 's where we 're going . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . " " New York . . . ? "  | " New York , yes . I 've changed my mind ; I do n't want to go to Chicago . " " You do n't want . . . ? " " No , not Chicago . I 've changed my mind . We happen to be heading the other way , sweetheart , which you would have noticed if you knew anything about the location of the sun in the sky ? do n't they teach you anything at school , those sad-faced bitches ? We happen to be heading east . " " East ? " Elena stared out at the bright , clear winter sky and saw nothing . Her vision went in and out of focus . " Yes , we 've been heading east for the last twenty minutes , " Ardis laughed . She reached over to pinch Elena 's cheek . " Who 's a cute little girl , eh ? Who 's a darling ? But you do n't know your directions of east and west yet , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name , eh ? Is it Elena Kansan ? Do you like that name ? Do you know what that name is worth ? " Elena had difficulty following this . She said , " What  --  what are " Guess , " Ardis said . " I do n't ? " " Your name and my name , guess how much they 're worth  --  our lovely last names ? Guess how much . " I , , " Guess , honey . Choose a number and put a dollar sign in front of it . " Elena blinked out at the rushing buildings , the other cars . " But what about Mr. Karman . . . ? " she asked . " I said choose a number , honey . And do n't be stingy either . " " Are n't you going to c-call him tonight ? " " Just choose a number . " Elena tried to think . " A million , " she said quickly . " Too high . " Elena 's mind raced . She tried to think of numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try again , honey . " " A thousand . . . ? " " Jesus , no ! " Ardis laughed . " I hope I can do better than that . Can you multiply that by seventy-five , though ? "  | " Seventy-five times a thousand . . . ? Seventy-five thousand ? " " Seventy-five thousand what ? " Ardis asked . " Dollars . . . ? " Elena asked blankly . " Not forints , " Ardis said . They lived for four years in New York City , from 1956 until 196o . They began in an apartment of six rooms that overlooked Central Park , on the eighth floor of an old , enormous , expensive building with plaster ceilings and antiquated molding and an elevator that reminded Elena of Mr. Karman 's apartment building ; then , eighteen months later , they moved to a smaller apartment on a street that led into the park ; when that lease ran out , Ardis sullenly moved herself and Elena and their things to a still smaller apartment on Third Avenue . Alarmed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally sublet that apartment and moved again to a very modem high-rise apartment building on 8oth Street , with thin walls and a balcony about three feet long and half a foot wide . Their two and a half rooms were classified as " luxury " and yet on the first day Elena discovered cockroaches in the kitchen . " Kill them and shut up about it , " Ardis commanded . She stood at the window and stared out at the layers of sky . She did n't speak again until that evening , when she said , " If you could just catch on as a model . . . if you could just catch someone 's eye .... " From the window I could see all the people , the cars  --  so many separate lives passing down there , all the traffic in its parts and hunks , surging and stopping . . . . I could lean out the window and slowly fall , slowly , my balance tilting out and down and slowly I could fall , down there , into all those people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about them , so many people , it was unmanageable , I had to walk to get a bus , I went to one  | school and then another school and then another school , I had to memorize the combinations for the locks on my lockers , I had to memorize street names , I had to sit very still when she fixed my face or the tweezers might slide into my eye . Do you want your eye poked out , she said . Who had time to record all the births and deaths ? Who cared ? Who noticed when someone fell , who was down on the street waiting with the clean-up brooms and hoses ? Pictures in the newspapers could be of anyone , old pictures used again and again . When I walked out there I never made a misstep . I numbered my steps and I walked in a rhythm from left to right , left to right , along with the sound of my heart , which I could hear perfectly . It was timed by my mother 's heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with a strong white cream and wiped that off with a sharp , prickling , acidlike green liquid and covered that with a layer of white paste that turned to powder and contracted , I kept time with her heartbeat , I could hear it perfectly . She was saying , Our future depends on how you do tomorrow , but underneath that I could hear her heart beating , beating , which meant that I was safe . A man approached Elena , frowning , staring , from outside the circle of lights . She could tell that he was coming to her and not to one of the other girls . He said in exasperation , " She just looks too young . " He rubbed her breasts hard ; he straightened up and tapped his front teeth ; he said finally , " Oh , fix her up , make her bigger on top  --  but hurry up  --  come on ? " and he walked away again and Elena thought Thank God . Those happy accidents did n't occur every day . She said , If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said , There are just too goddam many beautiful women in this city . Her eyebrows rose and arched thinly , regally . The important bone beneath them was accentuated by a smear of white . Elena stared at herself ; it looked as if the bone were showing through . Edgy , glancing sideways at people , she noticed how they walked in the street , slowing or quickening their paces , girls her own age , with bad posture or bad skin or hems that were not even , their shoe-boots stained with salt from the sidewalk , people who picked openly at their ears and talked loudly to one another , ugly people ,  | all of them ugly and real . For awhile she glanced at them , frightened of them . Then she stopped looking . She was n't afraid of the city , the horns and crowds and trip-hammers ; she stopped noticing it , she had memorized the route to and from school , to and from the grocery store , the drugstore , the subway . Noise in the other apartments did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television ; sometimes Ardis pounded viciously on the ceiling with a mop handle , or went next door to yell , but Elena was not really bothered . She was happiest at home , she liked television : the screen was just the right size , all the tumult scaled down and not nightmarish , and if it swayed suddenly and exploded into dots or zigzagging lines she could just switch it off . On Sundays Ardis was always in an excitable state : she leafed through the New York Times Magazine , assessing the models , figuring out their probable ages , sometimes holding the magazine up next to Elena 's face and shaking her head slowly , doubtfully . She might begin the day irritated and depressed but end it optimistically , and the next morning she would drag Elena around to the modeling agencies again , with a portfolio of photographs , forcing herself to be patient and sit and wait , wait . She complained to the receptionists that back in Cleveland both she and her daughter had had a lot of work , more than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic , but they were all beautiful themselves , they did not look like the receptionists back in Cleveland . Ardis knew she herself was a very beautiful woman , and that a certain power resided in her face and in her body , but for some reason this power had dimmed . . . . What was wrong , what was breaking down ? " Why do we stay in this damn city ? " she asked the receptionists . They did n't know . She was given a few assignments , and Elena a few more , but in the spring and summer of 1959 they had only one high-paying session , another advertisement for skin cream . It turned out so well that Ardis was certain it was really the beginning of a new career . The advertisement was run in several of the high-circulation women 's magazines and it did look good : a full-color , two-page spread in which mother and daughter held out their perfect hands and smiled their perfect smiles , both blond , with ten-inch page-boy cuts , very American and very sanitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring in awe at them both as if he could not decide between them . Could you choose between these beauties ? A paragraph beneath the picture explained that this was indeed a mother-and-daughter , a real mother-and-daughter , but could you tell who was the mother and who was the daughter ? Could you ? If you looked very closely , maybe . But could you be certain ? Elena sat and gazed at the advertisement , first gazed at herself on the left  --  the sixteen-year-old who looked eighteen but who was really only fourteen  --  that is , Elena herself was fourteen  --  and then on the right , the thirty-nine-year-old woman who looked eighteen but who really was thirty-six , Ardis 's true age . Sometimes she believed she was on the left , sometimes on the right . But no , that was her mother on the right  --  just the hint of a thickening beneath the eyes , but not really  --  you had to imagine it there  --  and when she glanced back at the other model , on the left , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The boy model was twenty-one but he too was sixteen years old in the picture . He looked a little older , maybe seventeen . Elena thought that his expression ? of bewilderment , wonder , pleasant surprise  --  was overdone , but he was handsome , handsome enough . But not too handsome . " I think your trouble is that you 're too beautiful , " Ardis said . " Ugly girls are coming into style . People identify with them  --  who gives a damn about a beautiful girl ? I do n't myself . Do you ? Does anyone ? " " I do n't know , " Elena said nervously . " Little ugly black girls are coming into style , " Ardis said in disgust . She kept waiting for new assignments , after the Lily 's Skin Cream success , but for some reason nothing happened . Nothing happened . She rummaged through one of the packing crates they had n't bothered to unpack since the last move and pulled out Elena 's old muskrat coat , which she had outgrown . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my old ranch mink , " she said . Elena knew her mother blamed her for their troubles , for the fact that what Ardis called the " Cleveland savings " were running out ; she saw the unopened envelopes lying around  --  bills , letters from the bank  --  but if she asked her mother about money Ardis always said coldly , " Our financial state is n't your concern . " She went to five furriers and got five insulting offers for the coats . She said , " What ! These skins are beautiful ! " Elena stood in  | misery while her mother argued , then became sarcastic , tossed Elena 's little muskrat coat onto the counter and said , " Take it for nothing , then , make a muff out of it ! ? make mittens out of it ! " Finally she accepted a few hundred dollars and walked out . " I hate this city , " she said . They walked home slowly . No , she could not manage New York . She could not accomplish anything here : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Elena , could n't hope to find anyone as understanding as Mr. Karman . And she hated all the noise , the streets always under repair , buildings being demolished and sites razed and new foundations poured , air hammers , the clanking of cranes , horns always being honked . Yet she did n't want to leave . Where else could she go ? Back in Pittsburgh she had a few relatives , " relatives of yours , too , Elena , but they 're worse off than I am  --  so that 's out . " She knew Cleveland , had contacts there and could probably get good jobs  --  but Cleveland was out . " You could try a regular job . . . an ordinary job , " Elena said uncertainly . " Sometimes I almost wish I 'd gone to Chicago , " Ardis said . They stood waiting quite a while for the elevator ; finally they gave up and walked the six flights to their apartment . " But the thought of him mauling me was repulsive . . . . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " it 's men mauling me . It 's very annoying , it 's boring . You wo n't like it either . You try to think about something else but you ca n't . Men are like machines , they 're like automatic washers that must go through certain cycles , one after the other , it 's all so predictable and boring . . . for women who have no imagination , who ca n't think of anything better to do with their lives , maybe it 's all right for them , but not for someone like me . Elena , embarrassed , did not reply . Back in the apartment she said again , shyly , " One of the girls I know at school ... her mother has a job . . . . She .... " " Make some coffee for us , honey , " Ardis said . She sat at the formica-topped table , in an alcove that opened off the living room ; she tapped her long silver fingernails impatiently . " Damn it , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Thirty , forty thousand would have gotten us a decent place somewhere , in some stupid one-horse town in Ohio  | or Pennsylvania , damn it ; goddamn it , why did I want to come to New York ? I had such inflated plans . . . . But why did n't they work ? " She picked up a woman 's fashion magazine , leafed listlessly through it , and tossed it down again . When Elena sat across from her she said suddenly , " What are you thinking about , Elena ? You have such a strange expression on your face . " " Nothing , " Elena said . " Yes , you were thinking of something . What was it ? Something you do n't want me to know about ? " " No . I do n't remember . Nothing . " " What I said about men . . . ? Was that it ? " Elena started guiltily . " No . " " Yes , " said Ardis . " I can read your mind . " " Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I ca n't ? " " Mother , that is n't possible , " Elena said with a nervous laugh . " Yes , you were thinking about men . . . and about Mr. Karman . You liked him , did n't you ? He was a good person , I liked him too . . . he was very good to us both . Men like him exist , Elena ; it 's a challenge to locate them . . . . Elena , do you believe in God ? Do they teach you about God in school ? " " No . " " Well , do you believe in God ? " Elena hesitated . " I do n't know .... Do you believe in God ? " " If I said I did , what then ? " Elena laughed . " Then I might believe too . " " Well , relax . I do n't happen to believe in God or in anything . " She raised her coffee cup slowly , thoughtfully , staring at Elena . " I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way of saying I do n't believe in anything , is n't it ? " " Maybe , " Elena said cautiously . " I believe life is experimental , " Ardis said . " Each person experimenting to see how far he can get . What do you think about that ? " Elena nodded . She thought she might as well agree .  | " But if I told you to believe in God , the Bible and all that , you would believe , would n't you ? " Ardis asked . " I do n't know . " " Would n't you ? If I proved it to you ? " Elena 's head swam . " Yes . If you proved it .... " " Well , I could if I wanted to . " Elena nodded . She felt dizzy . " You 're very sweet , Elena , " Ardis said . " Do n't feel bad about the modeling  --  I do n't think it was your fault , I think it 's just this city  --  there are too many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . My philosophy is : you 're not a failure until you die . And after that , who cares ? We 're our own ideas , we make ourselves up ; some women let men make them up , invent them , fall in love with them , they 're helpless to invent themselves . . . but not me , I 'm nobody 's idea but my own . I know who I am . I know who you are too . We 'll both do well , do n't worry , " she said cheerfully . As Elena watched , Ardis seemed to become younger , her lips twitching up into a smile that was a surprise of a smile . Elena stared in amazement . " So , honey , I 'll take your sensible advice and get a job . As you say , a regular job . An ordinary job . " " A job . . . ? " " Yes . What 's so surprising about that ? " " I . . . I did n't think you heard me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next day Elena came home from school at a quarter to four and found a note on the table : Might be late , might have a surprise for you . She smiled . The apartment was very peaceful , very empty . She sat down at once and did her homework , grateful not to her own dinner , would eat by herself ; would n't have to listen to Ardis teasing her , picking at her , questioning her . What are you thinking ? What are you always thinking ? What is that on your forehead  --  not a pimple ? The apartment was quiet , peaceful . Elena wandered out to the front room , looked out the window . The telephone rang but it was a wrong number : a woman who sounded rushed , angry . Elena considered telephoning one of the girls in her class , but could not decide which one . She did not have any best friend , any close  | friends . She believed that other girls liked her , but they were not really friends of hers ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she found something in the refrigerator  --  a container of yogurt , some potato salad she 'd made for dinner the night before . Eating , she noticed how quiet the apartment was , how her fork clicked against the plate . A television set was on somewhere , very loud . It must have been right over her head . After a while she brushed out her hair , brushing it slowly and methodically . She half turned , imagining her mother in the doorway  --  Clean that hairbrush when you 're through , her mother would say . She spent the evening watching television , waiting . Small jabs of panic : What if her mother did n't come back ? On the eleveno'clock news there was a picture of a young woman murdered that afternoon , in her apartment on West 58th Street . Assaulted and then strangled . Assaulted . Strangled . The woman was twenty-nine years old and very beautiful . Nervously , Elena listened and heard someone yelling : an argument somewhere . A man 's voice . She got up and turned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skittered helplessly and came to rest on something that had happened to her a few days before  --  nothing important , she had not told Ardis and had hardly thought about it at the time ; but now she remembered it clearly . A hefty young man in a denim jacket had bumped into her on the sidewalk , knocking her textbooks out of her arms , and he 'd stood there grinning while she picked them up . She had had to bend over to pick up the books . The young man said certain words to her . He was joking , happy , in a strangely exuberant mood , as if a little drunk . But he had n't followed her and she had walked away , not fast , and had forgotten it . He had walked right into her . She got up nervously and went into the bathroom . She cleaned the hairbrush in the sink and rinsed it several times to get the disinfectant out . She went back to watch television . But she had trouble concentrating . Was it a documentary ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoe ? She switched to another channel and recognized the face of James Stewart . Then a door opened and Joan Crawford  | came in , walking briskly , her expression stern ; so Elena left that on . She sat on the sofa and watched the movie , not bothering to look away when the commercials came on . She stared at the blue-gray screen , all the bustling figures and moving mouths , until that movie came to an end and another movie began . She stared as if hypnotized , holding herself stiffly . Finally Ardis came home : a rattle at the door , Ardis 's surprised voice . " Elena , are you still awake ? It 's four in the morning . Why did n't you put the safety catch on the door ? " Elena jumped up . A man was with her mother , a stranger . He was tall , thin , morose-looking . " This is Mr. Sadoff , " Ardis said . " Mr. Sadoff , my daughter Elena . " Elena stared at him . He shook hands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . There were slight dark pouches beneath his eyes . " Elena , turn off that television , it 's all buzzing and crazy lines , " Ardis said . " Mr. Sadoff is my new boss . I have a job starting tomorrow night . " Mr. Sadoff nodded . " Do n't you even want to know what my job is ? " Ardis asked . Elena looked at her blankly . She was elaborate , lovely , with a headful of dark auburn curls she had n't worn for years cascading like a mane onto her bare shoulders . She wore a cocktail dress of black satin , the neckline low , scooped out . Elena wondered for a moment if this was really her mother ; this woman was mixed up with the movie she had been watching some hours ago . But of course it was her mother . Elena , you look like a zombie , and do n't you have school tomorrow ? Children just love television . I do n't think it 's healthy for them , " Ardis said , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Sadoff and I are just going to have a little nightcap .... " Elena stood looking at her mother and this man , confused . Ardis pinched her cheek . " Now , off to bed ! She is a lovely kid , even if I say so myself , is n't she , Mr. Sadoff ? " " Call me Robie , " he said .  | Sadoff managed a nightclub in Manhattan , not far from Times Square . He was a dog-faced man in his forties or early fifties , oddly handsome , with a dark-jowled , thin , nervous face , tall  --  over six feet three or four inches  --  always gulping with laughter and then going silent , as if life were a barrage of comic routines that had to be acknowledged and then dismissed , acknowledged because they were paid for , then dismissed because they were n't really funny . Ardis worked as a cocktail waitress at the club  --  the Black Flamingo  --  and then as hostess , in a series of costumes of black chiffon , some with transparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes of flamingos , some of her own invention , because she liked to invent things for special people , she told Sadoff , and he and his club were special . She designed her own costume when she became " hostess " ; she thought the club needed an atmosphere of elegance . Sadoff agreed . He was married to a girl twenty years younger than he , but he was very fond of Ardis . She explained politely to him that she was interested only in working at his club , in learning about his club . She wanted to learn about it from the inside . She was retiring from modeling  --  she waved away his protests  --  yes , she was retiring from that , and she was retiring from men as well ; that was the truth , she wanted only to work seriously and she believed she could do a good job working for him . And it was true , she was an excellent waitress . He was so pleased with her that he fired the young woman who was " hostess " after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told the woman the club was entering a new phase and that she did n't contribute to it . Ardis carried herself regally . Sadoff was proud of her . " She 's very ladylike , " he told people enthusiastically in Ardis 's hearing . " There 's no fooling around with Ardis . " Sometimes he gave her presents  --  an inexpensive stole of rabbit fur , dyed an odd red-orange , some necklaces of cultured pearls ,  | things Ardis accepted gratefully and then passed along to Elena , pointing out that they were secondhand , she was sure  --  maybe things stolen from Sadoff 's wife 's possessions ? Because the Sadoffs were not happily married . Sometimes Sadoff gave Ardis a gift specifically for Elena , a charm bracelet that appeared new , in a box with " Cartier " on it , a leather shoulder bag he thought Elena could use to put her books and pencils in . " How old is Elena now ? She 's only about fourteen or fifteen , is n't she ? " he would ask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , where she had been sitting with some girls from her homeroom ; she returned in five minutes , experimentally , and noticed that the charm bracelet was gone . The stitching on the bag came apart in a few days and she threw it out . In 196o , Sadoff 's wife began divorce proceedings against him and Sadoff decided to leave New York ; he had an opportunity of buying into a nightclub in Detroit . He wanted Ardis to come along with him . He said he needed her . He was doggish , with cruel slitted eyes that moved about Ardis 's body continually , always ready to burst into laughter if Ardis said something funny  --  around Sadoff , she soon learned to be funny  --  and then falling back into a kind of surprised , bewildered gloom . But he had a genuine laugh , an appreciative laugh . Sometimes Ardis 's jokes made him screw up his face in a paroxysm of laughter and he had to wipe his eyes . She watched him at such times , her own face merry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually upon her bare shoulder or thigh , she moved away . No . Not her . Sadoff had been involved with most of the waitresses and the woman who had been hostess before Ardis , carrying yard-high menus with gold tassels , a lovely effortless job , and Ardis knew enough to draw away from him . She was a businesswoman , she explained . Nothing else . She was like a man : he could trust her . So in the end he agreed ; one day he said in surprise : " You really are like a man  --  I can trust you . " He had become dependent upon her and he begged her to come with him to Detroit . " It wo n't be a dump like this , " he said . " It will be a place to take pride in . " " I do n't know , " Ardis said slowly . " I hate to uproot my daughter .... " " How old is your daughter now ? Fourteen , fifteen ? It might be  | good for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better environment for a child . " " Elena has friends here and she 's doing so well at school , " Ardis said doubtfully . In a way she thought of Elena still as fourteen ; it was discouraging to remember her real age , and to be forced to automatically add twenty-two years onto that age . Ardis did n't believe in " ages " anyway , but she could not explain that to Sadoff . " She 's so sensitive .... " " Then let me take her out of New York . It 's no place for a girl like her . " Ardis hesitated . " Come with me . It 's a new adventure , " he begged . " But my home is here . " Home , hell ! This place is nobody 's home ! " Sadoff fell silent , troubled . Perhaps he was thinking about his wife . Then he said eagerly , " You can help me more with the books , you know , sort of ease into that ; maybe I can talk my partner into giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of the regular salary and the tips , you know . . . I mean . . . . Look , Ardis , we 'll both make money . That 's where home is . " Ardis hesitated . I was the girl photographed in the wreckage of the plane , body intact except for the smile , which was missing . No , I was the girl photographed for my high-school graduation , with a smile , but the newspaper was using the photograph to illustrate a front-page story about a girl who had been decapitated " by an angry suitor . " The decapitation took place six years after the high-school graduation but newspapers are n't allowed to publish pictures of heads without bodies . . . . But I was n't either of these girls . No . It did n't happen . And I was n't the woman who " plunged to her death " off a bridge but landed on a concrete abutment , which in the newspaper 's front-page photograph looked ordinary and blank except for the X someone had drawn . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same X if you are a woman or a man , any kind of victim . It marks the spot where photography begins . I was n't on the front page . I was the girl stepping out into the sunshine with two rented borzoi dogs on two leashes , the dogs ' heads high and elegant , my head high and elegant , framed by twenty-inch straight blond hair  | in the style of the day . I came out of the club 's ornate doors five or six times , smiling spontaneously for the photographers and the readers of the Amusement Section . The caption said , " Exotic guests at opening of new Pyramid Club . " The " Pyramid Club " was near the General Motors headquarters in Detroit , set back from the Boulevard , in a gigantic asphalt parking lot equipped to handle hundreds of cars . Its exterior was decorated with mosaics in the shapes of triangles and the profiles of Egyptian heads ; after a disappointing initial six-month period , it began to do well , though Sadoff always complained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept no secrets from her ; he was a good friend , sometimes depressed but then easily cheered up ; it made him happy to do favors for Ardis , so she allowed him to make the down-payment on a house so that she and her daughter could live like normal people again . It was her dream , she said , to " live like normal people . " She wanted Elena to finish high school like a normal girl , not like a model or a child who had been kidnaped by her own father , a madman . " A girl who looks like Elena also has to be protected against things , " Ardis said . Sadoff agreed . " At least we got her out of New York , " he said . To Elena , Ardis was always saying : " Invite girls home for dinner , why do n't you . Or to stay overnight . Do kids still have slumber parties . . . ? Robie would be delighted to send over all the Coke and pretzels and things for it , anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You should be proud of our house , " Ardis would say vaguely , zipping up the back of her tight , sparkling dress as she prepared to go to work . It was in a good section of Highland Park ? " still white , " as the realtor pointed out  --  a three-bedroom brick home on a fairly large lot . Elena liked the house very much . But she always said falteringly , " I do n't know anyone yet . . . . " Then , as the months passed , she said , " I do n't know anyone well enough yet . ... I do n't like anyone well enough . " " You should be proud of our house , " Ardis said often . When Elena got off the bus she always looked hungrily , eagerly , down the block to the house  --  yes , there it was  --  the house . She lived there . It was six houses from the corner and almost identical with the others , except its shutters were painted a bright cheerful yellow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | near the sidewalk , while the other driveways were always empty at this time of day . As she walked to the house Elena would say to herself silently , White , black . White , black . She would stare at the house and its drawn blinds and keep pace with her heartbeat , saying to herself , White , black . White , black . If she turned up the walk to the house on the word white , that meant it was indeed her house , she did live here , it was n't a mistake . If she turned up on the word black , there might be a stranger inside waiting for her . Once when they were out shopping at a supermarket , Ardis said sharply to Elena : " Are you talking to yourself ? " " No , " Elena said at once . She was very embarrassed . " I thought I saw your lips move . What were you saying ? " " Nothing . " " Not praying , were you ? " Ardis teased . Elena stiffened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were you praying to ? " Ardis laughed . Elena carried herself with her chin slightly raised , as Ardis had taught her , the skin of her throat bared regally . To prevent premature wrinkles . You 'd better take care of that face , carry it like crystal , Ardis had said . And now Elena thought impulsively , angrily , What a joke . And yet it was true . Something could be a joke and yet true . If she waited long enough and did not annoy her mother by defending herself , Ardis would change the topic . And in a few minutes she said , enthusiastically , " Elena , Robie wants to take us both out Saturday night . He says he 's been neglecting us both , he does n't see enough of you and wonders how you are . It would be a real treat for him , he said . " Elena recalled Sadoff 's hound-dog jowls , his cool , sad , appraising stare that moved slowly around her body and came to rest in the area around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Elena said . " What ? " " I do n't want to , " Elena said faintly . " Unless you happen to be busy on Saturday night . " " You know I 'm not busy on Saturday night . "  | " With all those friends of yours , all the friends you seem to have made here in Detroit , " Ardis said mockingly . " You know I 'm not busy on Saturday night . " They were at the end of an aisle . But Elena , who was pushing the cart  --  it was wobbly , veering to the left unless she pushed hard to the right  --  could not think for an instant what to do . She forgot where she was . Her mind swam : should she be busy on Saturday night ? Did her mother want her to be busy then ? Or . . . ? Her mother wanted her to have girl friends , friends who were girls , but never any boys , never boys . No boys . No friends . But , Elena thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't busy on Saturday night , so that Mr. Sadoff could take them out . That might be . She could n't decide . " I 'm going to let you decide , " Ardis said , exasperated . " Decide what ? " " Which way to turn . Which aisle . " Elena looked around . Cereal boxes , cans of soup with red and white labels . . . . She could not remember which aisle they had already gone down . " I do n't know , " she said blankly . " You 're not observant . You never pay attention to your surroundings , " Ardis said . " I do n't think you 're normal . " Elena looked from one side to the other . She was seventeen years old . She could not move . But a stranger , a woman with a small sexless child perched in her grocery cart , was right in front of her , waiting to turn into this aisle , to move between the cereal boxes and the soup cans , and it was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or the other ? It did not seem an important decision , but it was somehow important . I thought , Am I supposed to be busy on Saturday night ? My mother was smiling ironically . Disappointed . Always a little disappointed , but proud too . I was not beautiful enough ; I was too beautiful . I was n't beautiful at all . I was only pretty . Who gives a damn about a beautiful You do n't and neither does anyone else because you are not beautiful and do n't run the risk .  | If you saw the photograph of a dead woman in the paper , and if the face was a beautiful face you would think swiftly : Got you ! But then you would reconsider and think : Tough luck ! And then the third time , before your eye moved to another column , you would think : what a sad thing ... . You would read the rest of the paper in a good mood . If she had friends she would have been busy on Saturday night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other girls seemed to like her , but they were not friends . The boys could not be friends . They looked at her . Her teachers praised her because she memorized everything , she memorized what they said  --  sometimes even before they said it  --  she knew the style , the intonation . Except one day in biology class Mr. Hollander was irritated by her bright , blank face . He had asked her a question and she knew the answer . But as she sat at her desk she had been invisibly pressing each of her fingers down , her fingertips pressing into the wool of her pleated skirt ; she had been counting to herself in a perfect rhythm : ONE . TWO . THREE . FOUR . FIVE . SIX . SEVEN . EIGHT . NINE . TEN . She could not answer Mr. Hollander 's question until she came to the end of this , she could not even hear it . First she must finish counting , she must complete the series of numbers , in that strict rhythm , not speeding up ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replay it to herself . But it was almost too late ; it was too late . He was already asking the question again of another student and Elena had to interrupt him , and so he had been irritated . Puzzled . He had stared at her . Ardis grabbed hold of her and gave her a push . " Jesus , you 're blocking the way ! Ca n't you see she wants to get by ? " With a rude swing of her head indicating the other woman , Ardis shoved Elena to the right . " I swear , you 're not normal . You 're going to grow up just like your father , it must be a degeneration of genes . . . . Why ca n't you remember anything from one minute to the next ? We always go the same way in this damn store . " " I 'm sorry , " Elena said . Ardis snatched a can of something off a shelf and threw it into the cart . It clattered . Then , slowly , another can came loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the aisle and rolled . " Oh Jesus Christ ! " Ardis cried . She jumped back innocently , out of the way .  | " I 'll pick them up , " Elena said . She bent and picked them up . Five cans had fallen altogether . Canned asparagus tips . Elena carefully put them back on the shelf while her mother watched . Elena knew that her mother would forget about being angry in a few minutes . She pushed the cart along and at the end of the next aisle she remembered which way to turn . Ardis was saying , " ... told him you were getting excellent grades , that you did n't waste time like other girls your age . Not running around with boys , and not gawky and giggling like other girls . I hate teen-aged girls . The ones you see on the street . I hate their bad complexions and the way they use lipstick  --  they do n't know how to use it  --  and the way they hang around in bunches , white or black . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep aloof . " Elena nodded slowly . " When I was your age I was totally independent . Of other people , of other people 's ideas of me . I did n't give a damn for anybody . I did n't have any friends and I did n't want any . I never told you , but I moved out when I was thirteen , I got my first job at the age of thirteen , and paid for my own room and board . . . to get out from under my parents . . . . They were all right , I liked them , but I wanted to be independent . Turn to the right , honey , we 've already been down that aisle . . . do we need coffee , instant coffee ? It 's this way . " " Yes , " Elena said . She hoped her mother would talk about herself now . Sometimes Ardis alluded to her own childhood , her girlhood , her marriage . But she always mentioned these topics incidentally , as illustrations of something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the subject . " Oh , , low-calorie bread too , " Ardis said , snapping her fingers . She was always on a diet . Elena went back to get the bread and by the time she returned Ardis had pushed the cart along , humming to herself , and turned to Elena with an appraising smile : " But you , honey , you should gain a little weight . The general public does n't appreciate thinness . . . men do n't . " Elena nodded . " After all , you 're not a model any longer ; you have to make certain compromises with life . "  | On the way home she said suddenly , " Let 's buy you a new dress , for Saturday . " She drove down to Saks , humming . Elena was relieved that she was in such a good mood . Elena tried on several dresses , and Ardis chose one with a smooth fitted jersey top , blue and white stripes , and a flaring skirt ; Elena had no other outfit quite like this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress was oddly feminine , even a little showy , and it did not seem like anything Ardis might have chosen for her in the past . Ardis stood behind her as Elena stood in front of the three-way mirror and pulled her long hair back , trying to arrange it on top of her head ; stood analyzing her appearance for so long that Elena was embarrassed . She was aware of the saleswoman watching them . " Is something wrong , Mother ? " Elena asked nervously . Her heartbeat was slow , steady . No fear . No danger . She watched her mother 's calculating eyes in the mirror , saying to herself : White , black . White , black . White . Ardis ignored her . After a while she released her hair and put her hands on Elena 's shoulders , her gleaming fingernails on the shoulders of the striped dress , bringing her face next to Elena 's . Elena saw that she was passing judgment on her , but not personally . She was not personally in danger . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the club in his new Cadillac , which he had picked up only the day before ; he was very pleased with it , in an excellent mood ; he smiled often and his gums looked pink , rejuvenated . He said to Elena , " Your mother says you 're doing well in school , going to graduate in a few months ! Time flies ! " Yes , Elena said . She was sitting between Sadoff and her mother . " How do you like Detroit ? How do the schools here compare with New York ? " Sadoff asked . Elena noticed the rings he wore , one on the third finger of each hand  --  a large signet ring and a bulky gold ring with a raised design . " Is integration far along here ? " " Yes , " Elena said . " Well , I 'm optimistic about this city myself , " Sadoff said cheerfully . " I believe in integration , in the principle of it . It fits in with  | democracy . Are there many Negro kids in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , " Elena said . " Bet you ca n't wait to graduate , eh ? Or ? ? " Elena said nothing . Ardis laughed and said , " Elena likes school , she does very well at it . I think her vanity is flattered a little , is n't it , honey ? I do n't blame her . And it 's an easy life , being a student ... but that kind of life ca n't go on forever ; the world is n't a nursery . Sadoff chuckled . Then he sobered . " But she 's just a baby , you know . She ca n't go out on her own . " " I suppose not , " Ardis said thoughtfully . " It 's hard for a young girl , " Sadoff said . " I know . My wife had a hell of a time in New York before she met me . . . the betterlooking the girl , the worse a time she has . It is n't just show business but life itself . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , my wife , I mean my ex-wife , is a famous bitch , " Sadoff said viciously ; then his tone altered , eased back to its original conversational note , and he was saying something about the night air and the economic boom the city was enjoying . He smiled at Elena , who was leaning to the right in order to have a few inches between herself and Sadoff . " You 're so quiet and thoughtful , " he said . " What are you thinking about ? " At the club they were seated at a table in a corner , Sadoff 's favorite table , he said , because he could see everything from here . Elena had not been inside the club since she had helped with publicity for the opening , and now she did not recognize it , did not try to make sense of the noise and complications . A band was playing very loudly . There was a female singer and then a male comic , interruptions of applause and laughter , and half-shouted conversations between Sadoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from time to time , most of them men . They carried their drinks along with them . Elena was disturbed at first to realize that her mother knew so many people , so many people . . . . Sadoff invited everyone to sit down and help him celebrate . He was celebrating the completion of the first phase of his divorce case , back in New York . But it was going to be a complicated case and it was going to  | cost Sadoff many thousands of dollars . His wife was divorcing him and he had filed a countersuit . New York State law recognized only adultery as grounds for divorce ; both Sadoff and his wife wanted to claim adultery charges , but Sadoff 's attorney had explained to him why this was impossible . If the court believed that both Sadoff and his wife were guilty of adultery , no divorce would be granted and they would remain married . In the meantime Sadoff 's wife 's detectives claimed to have a taped telephone conversation between Sadoff and a woman that would be very damaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape did not exist . On the other hand , Sadoff 's detectives had genuine tapes of his wife 's conversations with several men , though of course he could not use them if he himself wanted the divorce to go through ... though maybe he would use them , maybe he would , to block her demands for alimony and an extravagant settlement . . . . And on and on . Elena gauged when it was time to smile or to appear sympathetic by her mother 's reactions , which were a little more emphatic than usual , as if Ardis were aware of Elena 's observation . Elena could see herself faintly , or someone who looked like her , in a frosted mirror not far away : the head held high , stiffly , the head of blond hair like a wire cloud around her head . She checked the image every few minutes to make sure it was still there . Near the end of the evening two men came to their table . Sadoff jumped to his feet . He had been drinking for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recovered himself and was alert and sociable ; he said excitedly , " Hello , John ! And Marvin Howe ? is n't it ? We 've never met but I know you from your pictures ? Very pleased to meet you , sit down , please sit down ! " The men shook hands with Ardis and Elena , stooping over them . " Very honored . Honored , " Howe said . He was a large , broad-shouldered , handsome man perhaps in his forties , stylishly dressed . The other man , whose name was Potter , was balding , impish , one of Sadoff 's Detroit attorneys ; the talk was immediately about a court case . Elena listened to the conversation but could not see the connection among these men . Howe was from St. Louis ; no , he had just flown back from St. Louis . Evidently he was a lawyer too . He had just won a case that afternoon .  | " Congratulations , " Sadoff said . " We can help you celebrate . Is it something we should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here , " Howe said . " Sure it did , " Potter said . " It got carried in last Sunday 's paper , a feature article . Do n't you remember ? ? the one where the man was found on the street , twelve stories down , and they tried to blame the wife and her boy friend . But it turned out they had no case . Carl Goldsmith , the man who owned the cereal business . " " Goldsmith , yes , I did read about that , " Sadoff said excitedly . " So you won it , Mr. Howe ? They were acquitted ? " " Mrs. Goldsmith was my client and she was acquitted , " Howe said . " Her friend was found guilty of second-degree murder . " " Goldsmith was found dead on the street , yes , I read about that , " Sadoff said . " The coroner said he had been drunk , he was all battered up , yeah , it must have been messy . But you won it for the wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million-dollar policy ? ? she collects the insurance , eh ? " " That 's the usual arrangement when a woman 's husband dies and has left an insurance policy naming her as his beneficiary , is n't it ? " Howe asked . " How much of the insurance money will she get to keep ? " Sadoff asked gaily . " I read it was a million-dollar policy ! " Howe ignored this question . He gave his order to a waiter and ignored Sadoff , who was still leaning forward , as if poised over an abyss , trembling , swaying . Elena saw in the mirror how he wiped at his nose , how his face darkened into an instant melancholy . The other attorney , Potter , changed the subject skillfully and they began to talk about some local murders , a chain-reaction series of murders set off by a dope trader 's encroachment into someone else 's territory , thirteen murders so far , " and it 's just gaining momentum , it 's going to spread out like a Malthusian tumor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head rang with all the voices . She tried to isolate her own heartbeat , to check it . After a while Sadoff recovered from being snubbed and was laughing again , more loudly than anyone else . He was leaning against Elena . At one point , as if absent-mindedly , he slid his arm around behind her on the black leather rim of their seat . Ardis talked with the men , asking questions , shaking ashes from her cig- arette into the ashtray  --  it was a genuine camel 's hoof , scooped out and sanitized and made functional . It was quite large . Then the conversation seemed to shift , to soften . Elena looked up and saw that Marvin Howe was smiling broadly at something Ardis was saying . It must have been an anecdote about Elena herself , because , bringing the story to a close , Ardis squeezed Elena 's hand and brought her face close to hers , as if the two of them were on television . " ? but we decided against it , in spite of the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , I mean for a girl like my daughter . Things disintegrate there . " The men agreed . They were looking frankly , curiously , at Elena . But they stared impersonally , as if she were n't even present ; it was not rude . " Women who make films acquire a certain hardness , " Howe said thoughtfully . " I mean physically , a hardness in the face , around the eyes . A calculating expression . I think it 's because everything in their lives is accelerated , like film : they run through too many lives , too many people . It would be unfortunate if your daughter got like that . " " Yes , it would , Elena is so sweet , " Ardis said . " Competition would destroy her . She just is n't competitive . She has led a very sheltered life .... " Elena smiled vaguely . Really , it did not concern her . She was not embarrassed . In her head she began to go through all the rooms she had slept in , moving across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beds and staring at the ceilings , the perpetual ceilings . . . . She worked backward from the room she lived in now : backward , slowly backward . She was in no hurry . But another room pushed into her consciousness , and she had to accept it ; she accepted it fondly , impersonally , it was just another room . With another ceiling . Then suddenly she was lying beneath three ceilings at once . This would have frightened her if she had been alone , but with so many people around her , talking and grinning , she could not show any alarm and maintained the same three-inch smile . She was in no danger . Now the subject was the St. Louis case again : a prosecution witness who had turned out to be a police witness , paid to testify . But hard for Howe to crack , because the man was from out of state ; he had been boyish and popular with the jury until Howe had man- aged to break him down . . . . They all congratulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own troubles . People laughed . It seemed that Mme. Trottier , the wife of the French consul , had walked through the plate-glass door of the club some months ago , though the door was clearly marked with gold leaf ? " Should I have painted a sign on it , DOOR , BEWARE OF DOOR ? " Sadoff cried ? and cut herself so badly that it took twenty-five stitches to sew her up . She was suing the Pyramid Club , Sadoff and his partner , for forty thousand dollars . " The scar is an improvement ; she should pay us , " Sadoff said . Then , he said , only a week later two customers had tried to drive out of the parking lot at the same time , very early in the morning , and had smashed each other 's cars . The club was being sued by both drivers , because one of the parking-lot floodlights had burned out at the rear of the lot . But Sadoff and his partner were themselves initiating a lawsuit , through Mr. Potter , against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club , and now a countersuit had been started against them by the president of that firm for alleged slander . Last year a complicated legal action had been started by the club against a famous nightclub comedian who had walked out on the second evening of a week 's run , claiming that the Detroit audience was too drunk to appreciate his routine and that he would not perform ; the club 's owner , Mr. Sadoff 's partner , had sued for breach of contract , but was being in turn sued by the comedian and his agent for failure to live up to all the terms of the comedian 's contract , which specified a dressing room of a certain size ? which the builders had never finished . " They say he 's rotting away in a so-called health farm out in California and I do n't give a damn , " Sadoff said bluntly . " He never made me laugh much . I hope he 's insured . " Howe laughed as if surprised , startled . He finished his drink . Elena noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each glass emptied . Sadoff said , " It 's an honor to meet you in person , Mr. Howe . I 've never met a genius before . Everyone I know says you 're a genius , but I do n't want to embarrass you . I like people to relax and be themselves , you know , be incognito in my place at any time . But when I murder my wife I hope you 'll defend me , " he said , barking with laughter .  | " Do n't talk like that , " Howe said . " Oh , it 's just a joke , I like to make jokes , " Sadoff said . His face sagged again . " I did n't mean it , " he said . " Do you take on a lot of cases at once ? " Ardis asked Howe , as if embarrassed for Sadoff . She was energetic and very pretty . " I 've read about your work and I 've often wondered . " " I have a number of associates in different parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the work for me , research work ... . I show up for the pretrial motions and maybe a few times during the preparation , then when the trial begins . I 'll probably have to start slowing down with age , " he said , smiling at Ardis . He smiled also at Elena , his glance sliding from Ardis 's face to Elena 's . " No , you wo n't , a man like you will never slow down , " Ardis said . It was a spontaneous , conversational remark  --  half shouted because of the din  --  and yet it was strange , surprising . Ardis said , " But your family  --  it must be difficult for them  --  you 're always traveling , and the publicity ? How has your wife adjusted to your work ? " " I 'm divorced , " Howe said . " I have n't seen my wife for fifteen years . " I 'm sorry , " Ardis said at once . Howe shrugged his shoulders . " Can I ask you one thing ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is your fee ? " " That is n't personal at all , that 's professional , " Howe said . " But I ca n't answer you . I charge anything from zero to over a million ? whatever I can get . Whatever the market will bear , and anything in between . " " Over a million . . . ? " Sadoff said . " Is that often ? Do you collect ? " " Eventually . " " Oh , eventually ? ? Then not right away ? Then there 's sometimes disagreement , a fight over the fee ? " Sadoff asked . " What do you do in that case ? " " We collect eventually . " Elena was listening to him , though close against her eyes was a vision of something oppressive , incomplete , not quite imagined , a ceiling pressing low , easing down upon her  --  she could not help but listen to Howe 's words , his voice breaking through the words .  | She began to look at him . The ceiling faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed to be watching her through the ceiling and then the ceiling faded . His suit was almost white , cream-colored , cut in a youthful style . His shirt was Chinese-red silk and his tie was made of a rich satin material , so shiny that it had no color at all . It was held in place by a diamond stickpin . The diamond gleamed . Like his face , it gleamed , it was public , meant to be looked at . As he talked he moved his shoulders restlessly inside the suit coat ; he kept shifting his weight , as if crossing and uncrossing his legs under the table . His skin seemed blotched , as if papered or pasted over . He kept laughing , creases came and went in that face . There was a tension in him , but it seemed to be under control . His eyes were heavy lidded , he had Sadoff 's look of cunning , but it was a warm , quick cunning , not reptilian and perplexed like Sadoff 's . " You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? " Ardis asked . " Innocent . " " Yes , I know , she was found innocent by the jury , but .... " Howe laughed irritably . " If she was acquitted of the charges by the jury , then she was acquitted of the charges . She is innocent . " " But did she do it ? " Potter interrupted with a laugh , " Ardis , there is no point to that question . That is n't even a question . " " Why not ? " Ardis said . " The law has nothing to do with history , it does n't replay history and make it permanent , it does n't provide us with scientific sensory proof of anything , " Howe said . " It finds for the defendant or for the prosecution . " " But you defend guilty people . " " No . Never . " " You never defend murderers , never ? ? " Ardis asked in exasperation . " There are no guilty people . The law establishes their guilt , it establishes whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public record and you can look it up . As for murderers ? who are murderers ? What do you mean by murderers ? " Ardis laughed , but her laughter was not really convincing . Elena felt the odd , nervous tension in. her mother ; she did not understand  | why Ardis was talking like this . " You do n't understand , " she said . " I 'm asking you whether you would knowingly defend a ? " " You do n't understand , " Howe said . " There are no guilty people under American law , not until someone finds them guilty . " " I do n't believe that , " Ardis said hotly . " I reject that . Men are guilty of all kinds of things  --  crimes  --  I know they are  --  I know . People commit crimes and they are guilty whether anyone catches them or not , whether they stand trial or not . We all know this . The murderers should be punished . They should all be punished . " Howe shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " That there are no murders , no crimes ? ? nothing ? " " I 'm not a judge . I do n't judge . I defend ; I 'm an officer of the court and my work is to defend accused people . I do n't make judgments , I do n't prosecute , I do n't execute . Would you like to do that ? ? execute ? Would you like that part of the law ? " Ardis stared at him . Then she seemed to come back to herself , to remember where she was . " We all have different roles in . . . in life , " Potter said hesitantly . " Is that what you mean , Marvin ? I think that 's what he means . " " You 'd like the executing role , " Howe said to Ardis , but sociably , smiling at her . Elena saw in a flash how handsome he was , smiling at her mother like that . " Why do n't you answer ? You can tell the truth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hollowed-out hoof skidded a few inches across the table ; Ardis caught it and steadied it . " I will tell the truth , I always tell the truth , " Ardis said . " I believe crime should be punished , that criminals should be punished . I do n't think we have to wait for decrees , to know what crime is . . . . As for executing people , no , why should I execute anyone ? There are executioners . There are paid executioners . " " Yes , that 's true , " Howe said slowly . " Some of us had hoped they might be out of work in a few years . . . since capital punishment is illegal , after all .... " Ardis laughed angrily . " Illegal ! That 's ridiculous ! " " ... it 's contrary to the Constitution , " Howe said . " Is that true ? Is it ? " Sadoff asked . His face showed a quick , sor- rowful excitement , as if he were not really interested in this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . if he says so , it must be true ; he 's a genius ; he 's one of our few Detroit geniuses . . . . As I said before , if I ever murder my ? " He broke off with another bark of laughter , confused and embarrassed . " Illegal , is it ? Capital punishment ? " Ardis asked ironically . " I thought you said nothing could be illegal , Mr. Howe ? How could the executioners be guilty of anything , if all they did was kill people ? ? or the judges , or anyone else  --  in fact , everyone else in the country  --  how could they be guilty , please tell us , if they are never brought to trial ? ? " " You 're right , you 're right , " Howe laughed . He glanced at Ardis with a shrewd , half-hostile , half-admiring look . " Yes , you 're right , there will always be paid executioners , of the kind you mean . Always . Constitutional or unconstitutional , the executions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you speak with the voice of absolute authority , the spirit of the folk , the instincts behind all the words , the books , the law . " For a while Ardis did not reply . Elena felt how tense her mother was , how keenly excited  --  as if she might at any moment do anything , say anything . It was dizzying , this freedom . Ardis 's eyes looked around the edge of the table , as if measuring it . And then everything softened in her face , seemed to become blurred and chastised . She shook her head as if she had n't understood , as if it were too complicated for her . " Women do n't understand the law , " she said . " Do n't you ? " Howe asked . " A person commits a certain act , at a certain point in time , and that time remains fixed while he evolves . That time is lost . It ca n't be recovered . We have only consequences to go by , a multiplication of possibilities ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found guilty of murder and is therefore a murderer under the law , is not the same man who committed the act that was judged to be an act of murder . The murderer evolves . The act is the same , it 's fixed in time , but the murderer is no longer the same person . His soul may be altered by the simple contemplation of what he did , which is part of what he is ; he is a consequence of his own action . But he would n't experience this contemplation if it were n't for the law . "  | Everyone sat in silence . From another part of the club came a wave of applause . Ardis said softly , " And you have your place in it ? ? you have a certain place in it , which you believe in , do n't you ? ? it is n't just for money , is it ? " " We all have our places in it , we are n't free of it at any time , " Howe said bluntly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , ignorance of the law is no excuse ! " Sadoff said . He cleared his throat . He said , " Sounds as if you get very involved with your work , your clients , Mr. Howe . Sounds as if they really get their money 's worth . Oh , no offense , " he said nervously , waving his hands . " I 've had a little to drink tonight . . . celebrating . . . . Glad to help you celebrate your very good luck on the Goldsmith case . ... everyone is proud of you back in Detroit .... " It was n't good luck , " Howe said . " Oh no , not good luck , I mean your good work . . . however it turned out . " " Thank you , " Howe said . " What are you going to do next ? " Sadoff asked . Almost against his will he kept talking , dreading Howe and yet unable to stop . Elena sensed this , watching Howe . She studied his face while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost too large a face to be understood . He was telling them about a case in collaboration with a Chicago attorney , a case that did not excite him ; then about a challenging case , a twenty-two-year-old soldier charged with shooting a young girl in the Philippines , near his Army base . He and another soldier had forced the girl to stand with empty beer cans on her head for target practice ; the young man had shot the girl through the left eye . " The Army is putting up twenty-five dollars a day for his defense , " Howe said . " I do n't want to hear about that , " Ardis said . " It 's just an event that became visible , " Howe said , shrugging his big shoulders . " It did n't bother you when it was invisible . " " What do you mean ? " " Things move from invisibility to visibility , " he said slowly . " There are tremendous forces , like hurricanes or floods , that people have inside them . Sometimes there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be stopped . . . . But then there 's calm again .  | It 's as if there were terrible ghosts inside us that were always prodding and testing our skins , looking for weaknesses . Then one day they rush out into the world , outside us . And so a crime ' is committed . And yet everyone is innocent until the crime he has committed is given a name . Until then he 's innocent . " Elena said suddenly , " Everyone is innocent . . . ? " He looked at her in surprise . " Everyone is the same . Everyone is innocent . . . ? " Elena asked . " Under the law , yes . Yes . As long as we stay invisible . " He spoke courteously to her , but he did not smile . His lips tensed . " Not just the bad people , but the people they do it to . . . the crimes to . . . ? " Elena said slowly , falteringly . She stared at Howe intensely ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everyone looking at her in surprise . Howe himself seemed embarrassed . " . . . those people . . . they are innocent too ? Even though they never get put on trial . . . ? I mean the victims ... . They 're innocent too . . . ? " Howe looked at her . He did not answer , as if he had n't understood or even heard her question . Over his shoulder the mirror was blurred , smoky , empty : it did not show any image of Elena . Ardis tapped her long fingernails against the table . " Come with me , Elena . Excuse us please , " she said , getting to her feet . Elena rose slowly , uncertainly . But she had to follow Ardis . The restroom was decorated in black and gold wallpaper , with large clay urns and electric lights in the shape of flaming torches ; it smelled of incense . Ardis waited until two women , talking loudly , left and then she said to Elena : " What are you doing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't play innocent : What are you doing ? Why did you talk like that ? " " I wanted to know ? " " Wanted to know what ? What ? Are you crazy , talking like that ? Well , maybe they 'll just think you 're drunk . My God ! You are so strange , so unreliable .... " Ardis approached her , frowning . Elena watched her guiltily . " What are you thinking , Elena ? "  | " Thinking ? About what ? " " Do n't play innocent , please . You 're not a child . I asked you : What are you thinking ? " " Nothing . " " No . Do n't lie . What have you been thinking about tonight at the table ? Since those two men joined us ? " " What  --  ? I do n't know ? I do n't know , " Elena said helplessly . " Do n't lie to me , please . It 's an insult to me . I know what you have n't been thinking about : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have you ? " Elena stared blankly . " You have n't been thinking about the future , have you ? ? about when you graduate from school ? Are you so self-centered you assume I will support you forever , a grown-up healthy girl like yourself ? Seventy-eight dollars for that dress  --  there you stand wearing it , a lovely dress like that , and you simply absorb it , you absorb the gift of it , without thinking of where it came from . You know nothing , you 're aware of nothing ! Do you think life is a continual party , with all the presents going to you ? " " You 're selfish to think of no one but yourself . You shut other people out  --  you 've shut Mr. Sadoff out completely ? You would n't even remember to thank him for tonight , would you , if I did n't tell you ? " Elena felt tears gather sharply in her eyes . But no . No . She would not cry . No . She said , " Mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to say  --  you 're sorry  --  you 're always sorry ? " " No , Mother ? " " Mother , Mother ! It 's so insulting to me , that you should try to manipulate me ! What are you trying to do ? " " The other one , not Sadoff ? " " What ? " " If I have to  --  if you  --  if you want me to ? If I ? " " What ? What are you trying to tell me ? " " The other one  --  Marvin Howe  --  Howe ? He ? I could ? " Then , suddenly , Ardis was everywhere in the black and gold room , in the dense perfume ; her laughter was part of the music piped in overhead , the mechanical clashing of cymbals . She took  | hold of Elena by the shoulders and shook her once , twice , in a kind of final exasperation . " Marvin Howe ! " she exclaimed . Rudely , bluntly , she laughed . Her face was very close to Elena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? So famous he 's written up in magazines  --  a millionaire  --  he has warehouses with things stashed away  --  furniture and fur coats and cars and television sets  --  loot from his clients ? he has his own plane , did you know that ? ? did you sense that ? Marvin Howe ! You say his name as if you knew him , you 're like one of his evil clients crying out his name to be saved  --  he 's an evil man himself , and I  --  I ? " She pushed Elena away . Angrily she took a cigarette out of her purse , she lit it , she wiped at her nose in a gesture that reminded Elena of Sadoff . . . . Then she looked across the smoky little room at Elena , who stood waiting . " You have too much of an imagination , " Ardis said . " It 's too much for you . You 'd need help . You could never keep up with your own imagination , you 'd need help , would n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer . She laughed and said , You have such an imagination ! And I would have to smile against my will , because she teased me into smiling ? the two of us brought up close together , walking by each other in the corridor of the house , meeting in the kitchen . When the telephone rang she went to it . She put her hand over the receiver and said , Elena , go into the other room Then she would say afterward , With all your secrets you might not know that other people can have secrets too , and I scanned her face to see ? What did it mean ? What did it mean ? When would it happen ? I did n't ask . One night he took my hand because the finger had been hurt ? the car door had happened to close on it  --  he stared at the blood  | around the edge of the nail . My face was bright and hot . He asked me something , I could n't hear , my face was so strange  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was ashamed , I could n't answer , I wanted him to forget about it . I did n't feel any pain , I could n't concentrate on pain . I did n't feel anything except the way he held my hand , another person 's skin against mine . It must hurt , he said , why do n't you cry if it hurts I did n't cry . They met Marvin Howe at the end of April . By the following Monday Elena had stopped thinking about him . She did not think of him at all . She came across the name " Martin Howe " somewhere and for a moment she believed that was the man she had met : then she remembered that he had had a different name . She forgot his face but remembered the shape of it , its presence . When she closed her eyes she saw or felt a hazy , powerful oval that might have been the fading glare of the sun on the inside of the eye , fading even while she tried to recover it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . In the back of her mind , in other rooms , she knew her life was being prepared . She knew it the way she knew the rhythm of her heart : it kept going , kept going , it did not betray her . The way her mother might suddenly say , " Come on , let 's wash your hair , " a sudden tender strange statement  --  when Ardis was dressed to go out , had only a few minutes  --  the way Ardis would talk , idly , cheerfully , about the need for a change in her life : " I ca n't do any more over there with the club , it does n't inspire me . And this house : It 's ugly . It 's worse during the day . " Ardis began to talk about television work ; she had a friend who directed a television station . " We all need new adventures , " she said . Elena did all the housework . When she came home from school she needed to put school out of her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So she vacuumed the rooms , slowly and methodically , she washed the dishes , grateful for the quiet mindless hypnotic ritual of washing dishes in miniature white bubbles , rinsing them dry , reaching in her pink rubber gloves for dishes beneath the surface of the water and guessing , knowing , exactly which dish it would be , rarely making a mistake . . . . To predict the exact dish was a kind of magic . She knew them all , had memorized them ; when there were only two people in the house , the  | same ten or twelve dishes were used constantly . It was a kind of magic , knowing these things . So she was disturbed when occasionally she picked up a dish and brought it out of the water and saw it was something she had not predicted . She did n't want to think about the high school , the halls and stairs and high-ceilinged rooms , the girls ' lavatory , the locker room , the antiquated gymnasium , the other students . Just ignore them , Ardis told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of trance , and her face must have shown her sorrow because Ardis had come to her and touched her , waking her . And she had not teased her , had not said anything about Elena 's secrecy . She had guessed it was school . Just ignore them , she said . Elena knew she was safe , that her life was being prepared , arranged , and yet she was frightened by the complex noises of the school , the complex faces , relationships , the pounding of feet on the old stairs , the accidental touch of other people . They were her own age , but somehow older . Two things happened to her but she told Ardis about only one of them . She was putting her things away in her gym locker one morning , after gym class , when her billfold somehow fell out of her purse and a number of coins rolled on the floor . Three other girls were nearby , two white girls and one black girl . One of the white girls bent over with a grunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tossed it back to Elena . The black girl , a small , trim , very dark girl who was always joking , put her foot down over some of the coins and stared expressionlessly at Elena . Elena tried to smile , automatically . " Whatcha gon na do ? " the girl asked . The other girls laughed . Elena did n't know what to do . " You want your money , whatcha gon na do about it ? " the girl said . Elena tried to smile again . But she could n't smile . She began to speak and heard herself say faintly , " You can have it ... it 's all right .. " The girl blinked in amazement . She turned away and Elena said , " No , you . . . you can have it . . . it 's all right ... I .... Please take the money .... " The girl slammed her locker shut , so hard it bounced open again . Elena looked down at the coins : two pennies and a quarter . " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl said . She  | walked away and the two white girls giggled wildly , not looking at Elena , who remained standing there for a while , even after the other girls left and the locker room was empty . She was late to her next class . Ardis said of this : " Do n't mix with niggers , and that kind of damn degrading thing wo n't happen to you . " One day a boy grabbed her in the hall and rubbed himself against her ; he reached out and yanked her over to him and grappled with her while the other boys laughed  --  Elena smelled whiskey  --  she was too confused to know what to do  --  she tried to push him away but she was too weak , frightened . A few girls who were standing nearby hurried away . Someone caught her from behind , sliding his forearm beneath her chin , almost choking her . She struggled , she tried to get free , clawing at his arm . The boys were close around her , laughing . She heard the excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sensation flowed out of her , her brain went dead , black The boys ran away . A man was talking to her , down into her face , and Elena 's hand fumbled against the front of her blouse , which had been ripped . But she held it closed . She stood very calmly , very quietly , she said , " No , I 'm all right , it 's all right . " The man was a teacher in the vocational arts program , a tall burly man . He was trying to comfort her but Elena said politely , " I 'm all right . " She did n't remember if the boys were white or black . Early in May , Elena walked into the house and her mother was waiting for her . She was sitting on the sofa , waiting . Elena 's heart began to pound . " I was talking to someone today , just this afternoon , " Ardis said . " You remember Marvin Howe . . . . " I knew what it was but I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been calling quite often but I did n't let him talk to you , " Ardis said . " It 's a very awkward situation for me ... because of course I 'm responsible for you , and he 's so much older . . . . And Robie , who knows more than I do , has said certain things . . . about Mr. Howe 's background . . . and . . . and of course it 's always an awkward thing for a mother to . . . . I told him how sheltered your life has been , I told him I could n't let him see you , it would n't be right . He has telephoned several times but I did n't want to alarm  | you .... " Elena stared at her mother 's face but it was not readable . It was not yet readable . Ardis laughed suddenly . " Do you ever notice anyone following you , Elena ? " " What ? Following me ? " " Yes , on the street or on the bus  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But you 're not very aware of other people , you probably would n't notice . . . . You walk around in such a dream , sometimes I wonder what you really see , " Ardis said , with a half-pitying , tender smile . " Who would be following me ? " Elena asked in amazement . " My father ? ? " " Your father ! " Ardis laughed . " But ? " In the past Ardis had often spoken of the danger of Elena 's father returning , of how he would want revenge : she believed she had seen him , or someone who looked like him , once in a department store , and once in a newspaper photograph of some anonymous men in a tavern who were congratulating an Irish Sweepstakes winner . Whenever this happened Ardis was quite shaken . But now she dismissed the idea scornfully . " And the telephone tapped ? Would your father be doing that ? " " Is the telephone tapped . . . ? I do n't understand , " Elena said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her cool , soft hands framing Elena 's face . Elena held her breath : but she was safe . " You are so sweet , so innocent , " Ardis laughed . Now her face was readable . I started to laugh but not so she could hear . We were facing the mirror . She put a towel over my shoulders and wiped my face  | clean , wiped everything off , hard . Then my face was like the opening of a dream : when everything is experimental . She took a comb and parted my hair down the middle , the center of my skull . Long hair , long blond hair . I wanted to laugh because I thought of how it might look dyed black . If she left me alone for half an hour I would dye it black . But that would n't happen . She stood behind me and I saw her two hands framing my head , my face , I felt her fingers beneath my jaws , firm . She was talking to me , instructing me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her and into me . You are so beautiful , she said , you 're at the center of the world . She stared and said , Elena , you are at the center of all the adventures , you are what men think about . . . women dream about you ... about you . Think of the statues , the famous statues made of stone , Elena , think of how perfect they are , the peace in them ... . They are n't like the rest of the world , where people are fighting one another . I 'm in that world , I know it , I belong to that world ; but you 're at the center , the center where everything is at peace . Remember this . I looked down upon my own body and saw that it had gone into stone , and the folds of my dress had become the creased folds of a gown . Such a body does not even need a head . I could see my own arms , what my arms had become , absolutely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her arms , which had gone into stone also . We had no weight , we were floating , we were half lying in space . We were gazing out into the distance or into time , into the future , we were both at the center of time and nothing could disturb us . People staring at us could not disturb us .. . . I was happy because I could feel her joy , the joy of her arms holding me . And I lay back lightly against her . There was no danger . Afterward he said , Do you miss her ? do you resent me for keeping her from you ? and I told him no . I did n't miss her because she was still with me . When they turned into the drive a large shape darted toward the car  --  a dog , not barking , but running silently alongside the car , its tongue lolling . The silence of the dog , its large , intelligent head , its stiffened ears , seemed to Elena something terrible . But Marvin  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal , is n't it ? Absolutely infallible . " Five or six German shepherds ran up to the car , leaping and whining for attention . Howe told them to keep back and they backed away , panting , sniffing , while Elena and Ardis got out of the car . The dogs were shuddering with excitement . " Because they see you 're with me , they accept you at once , " Howe explained . " They would never hurt you . They 're infallible . " The house was like a fortress , illuminated by floodlights , its ground-floor windows protected by thin curved iron bars . A cool wind blew toward them from the lake . The dogs had begun to bark in short eager yips , following them up the walk to the house . Ardis was asking Marvin Howe something about the dogs , but Elena could hear a certain strained , almost timorous quality in her mother 's voice . The dogs would n't kill ? ? would n't injure anyone ? she asked . They 're trained not to kill , Howe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkened second and third floors of the house : darkened windows . Ivy grew in thick , wild patches on the stone sides of the house , even over a few of the windows . Someone took Elena 's arm  --  it was Marvin Howe  --  and pointed out a coat of arms above the doorway , an antique piece of heraldry brought from England . A unicorn and a bear , several men , a single man on a large white horse . He was explaining the symbols and Elena stared up , obediently , very conscious of his touching her . " I came out of nowhere myself , " Howe was saying , " and that 's why I respect tradition so much . History  --  a long unbroken recorded history  --  English history and English law  --  I ca n't explain what such things mean to me . " They passed between thick stone columns , into the house and along a passageway . The dogs rushed in behind them and then around them , panting , whimpering with delight , leading the way . Marvin Howe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , explaining to Elena and her mother how he had yearned for this house  --  this particular house  --  for many years , how he had coveted it , almost violently , and how , at last , he had been able to buy it at auction  --  at the age of thirty , the exact age he had set for himself to " step up into his real life . " Elena did not understand , but she said nothing ; Ardis said nothing either .  | He came between us and frightened her : I think that was why I began to love him . They spent the evening in a room that confused and dazzled Elena : though she looked slowly at the things in it , though she tried to make sense of the various arrangements and objects , there was so much in it unfamiliar to her that she kept losing her way , she felt childlike and intimidated . But this was a kind of protection ; she could sit in silence , knowing exactly what she looked like on the outside , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself that would be stimulated in anyone 's brain , womanly and childlike at once , paying only vague attention to what Marvin Howe and her mother were saying . A few yards away one of the dogs lay chewing at a large , bare bone , slobbering onto the carpet between its forelegs , whining with pleasure . The room was not very large but its ceiling was distant , oval shaped , and from its center hung a chandelier . The crystal pieces were motionless and yet seemed to Elena always about to move , to twist ; she watched them . The walls were high , paneled in a kind of dark smooth wood , shadowy in part , gleaming in part , as if there were reflections of people or perhaps even people themselves , strangers , inside the wood , beneath the perfect surface of the wood , watching . Howe had told them , in triumph , of his outbidding everyone for this house : outbidding even the man who should have inherited it . The house and many of its ornamental features had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteenth century , reassembled here , put together by carpenters and craftsmen also brought from England . " For a boy from Oklahoma . . . . " Howe laughed . The room was filled with furniture and mirrors and pictures inside carved wooden frames . There was so much that Elena 's eyes kept moving helplessly from object to object , sliding along a table to the corner of a painting , drawn to the painting itself : dark oils , a stormy sky , a ship shooting up the crest of a wave as if with the force of a rocket  --  was this beautiful or ugly ? ? was it expensive ? On the marble mantelpiece was a bust , a woman 's head , on a kind of pedestal , a very plain , smooth face with blank smooth eyes . " I 'll be frank with you , " Howe was saying . " If you 've felt any curiosity about me  --  and I would n't blame you ? " he laughed , " you  | will already know about as much as you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean . " Ardis laughed nervously . Yes , she had done research : she had spent a day at the Detroit library , looking up information on " Marvin Howe . " She had brought home a stack of Xeroxed pages , gloating , incredulous ; she had forced Elena to read through them before even allowing her to take off her coat . " Then you know I was born in 1919 in the country outside Tulsa ? by outside ' I mean about a hundred miles west  --  and my family was dirt poor , and they 're all dead ; I treated them well while they were alive , so I feel no guilt about them . You have to treat human beings with that in mind . You know that , do n't you ? " he asked . Ardis agreed at once . Elena agreed . " All my life I knew by instinct how the dead reach out for the living , how you must be careful to prepare for the deaths of those near you . Of those who love you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these other deaths you must anticipate . Otherwise you will suffer terrible remorse . I knew this by instinct , the way I know most things , but in my work ? dealing with people who have suffered the deaths of others , usually close to them , and usually not accidental or natural deaths ? I came to know just how true this is . " Ardis was sitting in a gilt-framed chair , not quite relaxed , leaning forward to listen . Though Howe spoke slowly and clearly , as if conscious of the value of his words , there was this odd pressure in everyone  --  even Elena  --  to push a little forward , to concentrate on his words and on his face . Yet Elena found herself thinking suddenly of dyeing her hair black : she could almost see , superimposed on Howe 's face , the white tile walls of the bathroom at home , and then the sink , the black dye she would get from a drugstore , the warm water in the bowl , the noise the faucets would make , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must remember to wear . . . . She would feel slightly dizzy , leaning forward to sink her hair into the black water , into the odor , the final dead odor of black that would stain every hair , every single thin miraculous blond hair , every part of her scalp , her soul . . . . " I had no real education , I taught myself everything I know , mainly history and a little science , " Howe was saying . " Then , in the Air Force , I assisted a legal officer and I became acquainted with the workings of the law inside the military courtroom . . . then after that I financed myself through law school  --  not a par- ticularly good law school , but it served my purposes because I was n't going to need any connections or anyone doing favors for me . I knew what I was going to do , and I did it . I set myself the goal of making and keeping , unencumbered in the bank , at least one million dollars by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ahead of time . In interviews that always sounds rather blunt , especially if the interviewer is biased against me and wants to retaliate , in his writing , for any feelings of inferiority he might have suffered during the interview  --  but it happens to be the truth , and I worship the truth when it can be told . Because not much of it can be told , " he said seriously . " Yes , " Ardis said . " Yes . ' That 's true . " " Now , in at least one of our conversations , I told you that my family life  --  my immediate family  --  would never be of any concern to you or to Elena , " Howe said . He smiled at Elena . Behind him was a wall of books , many of them aged , water-stained , the bindings loose and faded ; others were new , smart , in uniform bindings with gilt letters on their spines ; here and there magazines had been stuck in , between books , partly ripped , bunched up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I are divorced ; I have n't seen her for fifteen years and never intend to see her again , and of my children I wo n't speak right now  --  in fact I probably never will . I have three children , two boys and a girl , and those facts are public enough , they 're a matter of public record , but beyond that  --  nothing . They have nothing to do with us , with the present . I 'll only say that I feel no guilt in relationship to them or to my wife ; that 's the most important thing I can tell you . Do you understand ? " He was looking at Elena . She nodded . " When it 's a matter of remarriage ... " Howe said slowly , " . . . a matter of beginning again , the only important thing is : has the old relationship absolutely ended ? And in my case it has . " " That 's true . . . that 's true in my case , our case also , " Ardis said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , I understand that 's so , the relationship is ended , " Howe said , nodding . " But this Leo Ross , this ex-husband of yours and Elena 's father , has never been located , has he ? " " No , but ? " " If I thought it was a matter of real importance , I could possibly locate him , " Howe said . " But . . . . In a kind of superficial , routine io6 Do With Me What You Will  | way , " he said lightly , with a half-embarrassed smile , " I did try to trace him . . . I did n't go to any trouble , really , it was just a perfunctory matter . But it all ends in San Francisco , as if he 'd died there . Maybe he did die . " " Die ... ? " Ardis asked strangely . " Oh , no . No . I do n't think so . A few times I think I 've seen him . . . but of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else . . . but . . . but I do n't think he 's dead , really .... " " We can assume he wo n't come back ; he would n't know who you are , he would n't know where you are , " Howe said . " Certainly he would n't know where Elena was . Let 's assume he died in San Francisco . " Howe glanced at Elena , who faced him still with that small , lovely smile ; his gaze seemed to become entangled with hers , to turn vague and loose for a moment . Then he laughed self-consciously and rubbed his hands together . " Now , " he said , " there are various rumors about me . . . some facts and a lot of lies . . . I do n't advise you to bother trying to sort them out , they 're irrelevant . All that part of my life , my outside life  --  let 's say my professional life and my private life outside this house  --  is going to be irrelevant to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage I 've had to struggle with a real dislike for women , a distrust of them , almost a terror of them . But I 've never been free of them and I wo n't lie about it . " He got to his feet and began to stroll around the room ; he paused at the corner where the dog lay and rubbed the dog 's large , shrewd head with the heel of his foot  --  the heel of his gleaming shoe just slightly raised ; he thrust his hands in the pockets of his sports jacket and turned back to Elena and her mother , frowning , passing along a wall that was all draperies and tapestries . " They always fought me in the end . They began by loving me and then they fought me and I had to get rid of them , the way you have to tear off clothes that are too tight or suddenly disgust you . But I never married after the first time . There have been so many people in my life , " he said almost helplessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , " Ardis said slowly . One evening they were alone , Elena and Marvin Howe , and he discovered she had hurt herself  --  a trivial accident , her right fore- finger bruised when a car door swung in upon it . He seized her hand , inspected the finger , where a few drops of blood had oozed out from under the nail . " Elena , why did n't you say something ? Elena , this must hurt very much ? " Embarrassed , Elena tried to pull her hand away . " No , it 's all right , it 's nothing , " she laughed . " But  --  it must hurt ? Does n't it hurt ? " " I do n't know , I do n't feel it , it 's nothing , " Elena said . He kissed her finger . He pressed her hand against his cheek , seemed for a moment almost about to weep ; then he smiled at her . " You 're so sweet , so good , " he said . " Whatever you hear about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women now , women who try to make claims  --  because I ca n't organize that part of my life very coherently  --  you would n't understand , Elena  --  whatever you hear , do n't give it much value . It does n't have anything to do with you . I 've explained this more thoroughly to your mother and she understands . Do you promise , Elena ? " " Yes . " " And your finger  --  it does n't hurt , really ? Or should I take you to a doctor ? " Elena laughed . " It 's nothing . But it looks ugly , so do n't look at it . " She drew it away from him . She felt a slight tinge of shame , an almost pleasurable sensation . Deep in the pit of her belly , an ache ... and she found herself thinking of the boys in the hall of her high school , the crowd of boys , the way one of them had grabbed her and pressed himself against her . From time to time , involuntarily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty sensation would begin in her , but it was always too faint to hold onto , to strengthen . And now , with Marvin Howe , the sensation was too faint ; it faded . I said to myself what a joke this is , the telephone calls and the visits and the talking , the talking . I said to myself I did n't want it , but then I remembered that I did want it , I wanted something . I wanted to take my face off with a Kleenex and throw it down on the floor and say , There it is ! Down there on the floor ! Then one day Ardis was saying angrily : " It 's an insult and I 'm not going to put up with it ! " Howe wanted to keep the marriage secret .  | He left Detroit and Ardis waited , and during those three days she raged , not bothering to fix herself up , even to get dressed . She lit cigarettes and stubbed them out angrily . She kept saying to Elena , " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed by you ! " " I do n't know what I did wrong , " Elena said indifferently . " He 's been so disillusioned with women ... I can understand that , and the business about not wanting children , yes , I can understand that , " Ardis said in a rushed , incredulous voice , " but a secret marriage ? No . You wo n't do it . No . Absolutely not . " A dozen times a day she read through the document  --  the marriage contract Howe had given her  --  and threw it down again , baffled . This contract contained forty-five clauses . Ardis had taken it immediately to an acquaintance of hers , an attorney whose office was in the Fisher Building , near the Pyramid Club , and the attorney had told her that forty-five clauses were not much ; that the document was not extraordinary ; that it could probably be broken , in part , if it were ever contested strenuously . He explained to her that a marriage does not take place between two people , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state is a third party to any marriage contract , carefully worded or not . No , the document was n't extraordinary . Certain parts could probably be broken , but in general it would hold . For Howe to marry without this legal caution would have been absurd , the attorney said , and Ardis had had to agree . Still , she was curious why divorce was n't mentioned  --  was n't that the main idea ? To protect his estate against a divorce settlement and alimony ? " Public policy forbids any mention of that , of the dissolution of marriage , " the attorney said . So she came back to Elena and said , " It 's airtight . It means you 're waiving interest in his estate , it adds up to that , and the other clauses are n't important . . . . They 're important , yes , but they do n't have anything to do with money . But still , you 're not going to sign this thing yet . " When Marvin came back to town he telephoned Ardis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ardis returned , flushed , very excited , and told Elena he not only refused to withdraw that clause , but had added another : that Elena not be subject to any outside influences ,  | " meaning me , meaning your mother ! Meaning me ! " she cried . She opened her purse and threw down a vial of pills . Elena looked at them . " What 's that ? " she asked . " Sleeping pills ! Barbiturates ! " Elena walked into her bedroom . Her mother followed and turned on the light . " I told him you were very upset  --  very emotional ? I told him I would n't be responsible for what might happen to you  --  if you felt he had rejected you , that he was ashamed of you ? " Elena shuddered . The next morning the telephone rang and Ardis answered it on the sixth ring . She had n't bothered to wipe her make-up off from the day before , she was so disgusted and wrought up . Her face glowed . Her eyes glittered . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , fine , good , you do your traveling and she is n't going to mind  --  she has agreed to that  --  so far as she can understand it , yes , of course  --  she 's led a very sheltered life and ? And look : I do n't particularly care to have a son-in-law your age , born in 1919 , so I have no designs on forcing family life on you ? forcing a mother-in-law on you at our ages ! ? Fine , good ! I happen to have plans for a life of my own , believe it or not ! You are not the only person who thinks about the future ! She will agree about the traveling , the time you 'll spend away from home , yes , yes , and everything under that heading , but she wo n't agree to the last clause and  --  and I wo n't be responsible for anything that happens to her either  --  you can imagine how a young girl would feel , a girl like Elena who is  --  who happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One year , and then ? ? No . Absolutely not . That 's the same thing . No . I realize you are n't an ordinary man , " Ardis said mockingly , " I realize from all the things I 've read about you that you 're a little eccentric , but that 's all right , you 're also a genius or so they say  --  but  --  my daughter is n't going to masquerade as ? No , it does n't matter where you live , it would n't change anything if you lived somewhere else . What ? No . I said no . She does love you and I am willing to admit that you love her , yes , and respect her , or you 'd never go to all this trouble  --  but you do n't respect her enough  --  not quite enough ? And ? What ? " She listened , staring at the floor . Elena was watching . She had  | never seen her mother so excited , so beautiful . Really , she was beautiful  --  even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her dressing gown falling open . I called out to myself from a distance , Elena ! Can your life be a joke and yet serious ? Can you swallow a handful of pills as a joke , die as a joke , but die dead ? Ardis put down the receiver . She looked at Elena and reached , groping , for her crumpled package of cigarettes , in which only a single cigarette remained . Her eyes looked enlarged , unnatural . But she flashed Elena a smile and Elena knew they had won . " You 're set for life , " she said . He kissed me and said he had never been afraid of being a fool . Never afraid of taking risks , or of people laughing at him . He said , My secret is that I do n't have any limits . I take a chance on anything . I said it would take all my life to understand him . He said , No , you wo n't understand me , Elena , but he was gentle because he loved me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was his wife and I loved him . II ? A ten-foot piece of furniture , with hard carved edges , a mirror that gave back a slightly distorted , discolored view of Elena and her husband ; the doors inlaid with gold and ebony , an odor of dust and aged furniture polish . " Eighteenth-century , a German cabinet , " Marvin said . He was reading the yellow tag attached to one of the drawers . " It 's beautiful , Elena , is n't it ? " Elena believed it was beautiful , yes . Her face floated , ghostlike , in the mirror . Her long hair was fixed in thick braids and wound around her head , so that she looked like an eighteenth-century woman herself , peering shyly out at them , trapped somehow inside this stern , fussy piece of furniture . She saw her husband 's face beside hers , not floating but solid , heavy , fixed to his shoulders .  | " Yes , it 's very beautiful , " she said . Her fingers came away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a child 's model train but too small for anything else , too small for anyone to sit inside it , a handsome locomotive , several boxcars , passenger cars , even a wagonlit , even a caboose . Marvin stooped over to peer inside the windows . " Little tables set up for dinner , " he laughed . " Little people sitting at them . . . white tablecloths and bottles of champagne ... . This strange thing is worth five thousand dollars . That 's what it brought at an auction : five thousand dollars . Do you like it ? " Elena smiled , not knowing what to say . " It came from the Croxley estate , all the way from New Jersey , " Marvin said . " I did n't want it , but what the hell . . . . It came along with three vanloads of excellent things . " ? A life-sized portrait of a woman with a low forehead and wispy , curly bangs , skin that was too flesh-toned to be natural ; a high , tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet sleeves that came out to the middle of the woman 's small pink hands . Like Elena , she was wearing a dress that covered her all up , the chest and shoulders and arms . She was chaste but dowdy , and a thick film of dust covered her and the heavy gilt frame surrounding her . " She looks like an American housewife dressed up as the mistress of an English country house , " Marvin said . He bent to look at the tag . " Yes . That 's what she is . Caryl Swift 's wife  --  Swift , the yachting-accident man  --  yes , I remember him , though it was a very short trial . I do n't know why he gave me this damn thing ; it obviously has no value to me . People 's portraits have no value .... " " She looks very unhappy , " Elena said . " No , she does n't look unhappy , you 're reading that into her face , " Marvin said bluntly . As if to soften his remark , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the woman in the portrait . " I see there a self-satisfied , ignorant , semiliterate , semiattractive millionaire 's wife , one of thousands . You can read the contempt the artist felt for her in the color of the skin ; no sane painter would make skin that color . Unless he was joking . " " What happened to her ? " Elena asked reluctantly . " They disappeared . They fell out the bottom . " " Was her husband guilty ? " " We won . But they had to sign everything over to me. "  | ? A dining room table opened to its full length , piled high with tarnished silverware , goblets , mismatched plates , fruit bowls , candlestick holders , matchboxes , cigarette boxes made of delicate carved wood , a velvet-lined jewelry box heaped high with jewelry , carelessly folded draperies and tapestries woven with designs of flowers , birds , fantastic animals in wool and silk , even a few dusty bottles of wine tipped over into jumbled heaps of golden doorknobs and curtain rods and door hinges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it around Elena 's neck ; it was made of what appeared to be gold , and was quite heavy . " That looks perfect , " Marvin said with satisfaction . He pawed through the debris and came across a rope of pearls , but when he tried to pull it free the string snapped and the pearls fell loose . He grunted with amused irritation as the pearls bounced around his feet and rolled away into the dust . Then he found another pearl necklace . He came to Elena and put this around her neck ; she bent her head submissively . " It 's perfect , " Marvin said . He stared at her . Close up , he was not a handsome man . But his face was powerful , as if it were all muscle , tensed and cunning muscle . His skin appeared almost to be multilayered , of different thicknesses . He was solid , heavy , deep , while Elena felt the skin of her own face to be so delicate that a pencil mark might injure it . Marvin smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly crooked , rather discolored teeth . He was staring at Elena but did not seem to be aware of her . " These things were waiting for you for decades , " he said . " In fact , for centuries . Beautiful things like this are just in the temporary keeping of ugly people , of ordinary people  --  they are really destined for someone like you , for someone like me to give to you . " He looped another necklace around her neck , a long light golden chain studded with stones of some kind . Elena felt his warm , meaty , intimate breath ; it seemed to her she had been feeling it all her life . They had been married now for nearly a year . But the year had stretched out , it seemed to be stretching out farther and farther into the past , obliterating Elena 's past , making it uncomplicated and orderly and safe . " Thank you , they 're very beautiful , " Elena said . " I want to give you everything , " Marvin said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lined with dirt . His jaw and cheeks had been shaved that morning , as always , but unevenly , and already his beard had begun to push itself out again , so that another face seemed directly beneath the bumpy surface of this face , shadowy and shrewd . The heavy lids of Marvin 's eyes were always moving , his gaze always centering upon something and then recentering , refocusing , so that the mechanism of his thought , his thinking , was visible . Elena could see him thinking . At night he sometimes pressed himself against Elena , asleep , unconscious , groping for her and finding her . Not able to sleep herself , Elena would see how his face was mysterious , dark , unfathomable , any man 's face , but her husband 's face , her husband 's . She loved him . She would hold him in her arms and feel the ceaseless alert movement of his eyes , though he was asleep . He was still looking , still thinking . His eyes were still focusing upon something though he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except he was her husband , he was not set in opposition to her , he was not dangerous to her . He protected her . His strength had to do with the words that flooded his head , the ceaseless mechanism of his brain . She was grateful to be lying beside him , his wife , holding him in her arms while he slept his restless sleep ; as his head filled with words , Elena 's drained dry . As the machinery of his brain worked , a deep holy silent peace spread through Elena 's brain like ink . " Why do you look so thoughtful ? What are you thinking about ? " Marvin asked . " ... thinking of all the beautiful things here . . . the things that are lost .... " " They 're not lost , " Marvin said , correcting her . " We have them . " " But we do n't know what they are .... " " But we have them , we own them . " He found a ring inside a ceramic dish and slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large . He laughed and slid it on his own finger : it was a man 's ring , carved of what appeared to be a kind of tusk . " Yes , we own everything , " he said cheerfully , " whether we bother to make an inventory of it , or seal it up and forget about it forever , let it rot or burn down or be devoured by moths . . . . Nobody else owns it . Nobody else can get to it . " He was in an  | excellent mood . He took Elena by the shoulders and kissed her . " Do you love me ? Was this a nice surprise for you ? " " Oh yes , I love you , " she said in a whisper . ? A ravaged chest of drawers , scraped and scratched , a sideboard piled with filthy lace curtains and yellowed brocade , a television set with a very small screen , " one of the first sets manufactured anywhere , " Marvin declared ; but without much interest . Cut-glass vases filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elephants , horses , parts of broken figures , human and animal , all mixed together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle , hopelessly confused . This would have made Elena dizzy except for Marvin 's hand closed lightly about her arm . In another mirror ? propped up against some stained velvet cushions  --  she came across her own face , the surprise of her white-blond hair and the impeccable chastity of her cheekbones and lips , and she thought with surprised pleasure that her face continued its existence , independent of her , of her thinking or her emotions , that it was a constant , as predictable and stable as anything in the universe . Marvin 's ruddy face appeared beside hers , but he was looking at something else and did not notice her watching him . " This antique , " he said , reading a tag , " is evidently a copy of Queen Victoria 's writing desk . Look at all the gold ... the handles , the knobs ... and mother-of-pearl on every drawer . . . . It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or do you like it , Elena ? " " It would n't fit in our house , " she said . He noticed the mirror she was looking into , and lowered his head beside hers , self-consciously , almost shyly , as if he feared looking at himself so openly . His hair was thick and tufted , sandycolored in part , in part a deeper brown-red , and around his temples gray , even gray threaded with white . He seemed a different kind of human being , or a creature who belonged to a species other than Elena 's . His skin was remarkably coarse beside hers . But he smiled at her . " Monsters have too much personality , like some of the antiques here , " he said . " Like me .... They do n't fit into anyone 's house , really . " Most of the time he seemed to forget himself , though he always dressed well , or began the day looking well ; but sometimes he made joking , derisive comments about himself , brushing dandruff off his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacing restlessly around the house and rubbing his hand across the wide front of his stomach and lower chest , complaining of being heavy , middle-aged , slowed-down . . . . He worked all the time , maybe sixteen hours a day . Then he stopped work suddenly and went somewhere : to the north of Michigan , to hunt with men Elena never met , to go canoeing , white-water canoeing , which was dangerous but good for him , as he said , " good for his heart . " Or , on one of his business trips , he stayed over for a few days to hunt or fish or hike in the mountains ; not long ago he and three other men were deep-sea fishing off the Florida coast and were caught in squalls for twenty hours . When he returned from these feats he was always in an excellent mood , a few pounds lighter , but he went back immediately to his long crammed days of work . " Do you think I am a monster , Elena ? A freak ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised . But he laughed self-consciously , flushing . He did not explain . Instead he opened one of the little doors in the writing desk and came across a clock , decorated with gold leaf . He tapped at it , as if to get it running again ; but it was very delicate , or maybe it had been already cracked , because the glass face broke . " All this junk , " he said slowly . ? Rolled-up carpets , sofas draped with sad-looking white covers , chairs stacked upon one another ; a corner of the warehouse jammed with refrigerators , their doors open , very white and silent and aggrieved ; a large , beautiful rocking horse with a glazed palimino hide and a shredded mane and bulging , astonished eyes ; a Victorian doll 's house with a gabled roof and many rooms , even a ballroom , now stuffed with items , with bits and fragments of things . Paintings were stacked together , most of them in heavy frames . Elena lifted up one of them to look at it : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was a maniac , " Marvin said . " Tried to fire me after seven months of work . He was a maniac . . . that saved him in the end .... Jesus , look at all these portraits ! All these people ! This place is like that part of the ocean where all the debris winds up , whether it 's expensive debris or just seaweed .... And I own it all .... I do n't even know who these people are , these faces . Imagine them sitting for an artist , sitting patiently and paying so much money  --  such vanity ! ? only to wind up stacked together here , for me to look at , the first time in five  | years I 've bothered to drop in here . I should get rid of it all , but ... I have a sentimental feeling about these things , possessions , especially things other people have owned or cherished , expensive things . Money is so abstract ; in a way it does n't exist ; but things are very real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and time spent their lives accumulating these things , and in a way I assimilate them , their lives , simply by owning their possessions , whether I bother to look at them or not . " He spoke cheerfully and simply , looking through the portraits . Elena thought the people in the portraits shared the same expression : vague stupefied alarm , bewilderment , terror . Even those who smiled were smiling out of fear , staring up into Marvin Howe 's face . " I do n't recognize most of these people . Who the hell are they . . . ? Even my clients fade out of my mind . . . everyone fades . . . it 's too much of an effort to remember people once you 're finished with them . . . . This man looks familiar , but I do n't remember his name . I do n't remember what he was charged with . . . probably murder . . . . You know , Elena , at one time in my life I must have known this man thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew who his parents were , I knew his friends , his business associates , his enemies , his employees , I had conversations with the man who sold him newspapers at a newsstand near his office , one of my assistants might have become friendly with one of his girl friends , or his wife , I had long tearful conversations with his children , his mother-in-law . . . . And then , as soon as the case was finished , I wiped everything out of my mind : I cleansed myself of him completely . . . . Oh yes , this man . . . this is Miles Stock . I have n't forgotten him . Did you ever hear of the Stock case , in Chicago ? " Elena stared at the thin-faced man in the portrait , who reminded her of her father : he had that same tense , birdlike expectancy about his head and shoulders , a look of somehow leaning out of the canvas . But he was fairly young , perhaps around thirty , with sleek dark hair parted neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stock . He was convicted of first-degree murder , in Cook County , and his family hired me for the appeal . I got him a retrial and finally an acquittal , and the bastard disappeared . He left the country . His mother came to my office and handed me the key to her house in Chicago , just handed me the key and walked out again . This happened only a few years ago and I think of Stock  | from time to time , I 'm almost waiting for him to return , to show up someday in my office to kill me . " Elena turned sharply to him . " What ? Kill you ? " " I mean try to kill me , try to . . . because nobody is going to kill me , never . That wo n't happen . I 'm going to be around for a very long time yet . This man , Stock , thought I had insulted him , and he was very hateful to me . I told him I could n't represent him if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , days on end , and then finally he broke down and told me the truth  --  which of course I already knew  --  and he wept in my arms , and I pushed him away . I did n't think , I was just repulsed by him , I shoved him away . He said , You 're rejecting me physically , ' and after that he hated me . He had killed someone in Chicago but I got him acquitted because of . . . because of . . . . Actually , he was very strong , " Marvin said , half-admiringly . " He looked thin but he was very wiry and strong , like men of that physical type . They 're like weasels or rats ; they surprise you . " " How did you get him acquitted ? " Elena asked . Marvin laughed and rapped his fingers against the man 's face , an irritated contemptuous gesture and yet halfway affectionate . " I do n't want to talk about it , " he said . Elena was startled . Marvin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my work . . . not even the work I 've successfully completed . . . . If you ask me about these people , I 'm inclined to answer just to please you , but I would rather not have you ask . In the Stock case , the prosecution 's case was all circumstantial evidence , Stock and his boy seen here , seen there , at nine-fifteen , at ten-thirty , bits of hair and blood in the back seat of a car . . . . The usual thing , a series of absolutely damning facts that mean nothing . The second time around Stock had an intelligent defense and he went free . " " It 's terrible to know a guilty man is thinking of you somewhere , " Elena said apologetically , knowing she should not speak and yet somehow unable to stop . " That he might come back .... " " He wo n't come back . Forget I said that . Forget everything I said , " Marvin said . " But here 's my advice : Do n't allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries in your arms , you 're stuck with him for life . If you try to push him away or escape him , he 'll want you to die . "  | ? Terrace furniture , chipped lawn furniture , bird baths , parts of dismantled fountains , a harpsichord piled high with toy soldiers holding bayonets like toothpicks , but sharp-looking and deadly , dolls in evening gowns and wedding dresses and ballet outfits , Royal Doulton figurines , broken and whole , old piano sheet music and Cuddeback 's Second Year at the Piano , an orange , wrinkled book ; and a narrow bed with a canopy of scalloped brocade , velvetcovered pillows in a tumble on the satin bedspread , a thick brass curtain rod lying across it as if thrown there in anger . Marvin took hold of one of the bed 's posts and gave the bed a shake . It creaked . He pushed the brass rod off onto the floor , making a clattering , hollow noise ; the bedspread kept the rod 's indentation . The headboard was cushioned , quilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and filmy trees . " Three hundred years old , an Italian piece , " Marvin said . " Obviously put together with love . It 's beautiful , is n't it ? I remember it from the last time I was here . I must have walked back out this way , because I remember this bed . . . . I can imagine someone sleeping here , ca n't you , Elena ? Maybe a queen ? An Italian princess ? A young woman lying on this satin spread , a beautiful young woman . . . . Like you , Elena . I can imagine the face , the skin like porcelain , the hair loose like yours when you take it down , I can imagine a body lying there , a young girl in her own bed , an unmarried girl . . . . Imagine her there , looking out at us in the year 1961 , two Americans who have inherited everything ! We 've inherited her bed , her elegant brocaded canopy , her carved posts , her spirit . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , dear . Please . " Elena hesitated . " Just lie down for a moment , dear . " Marvin 's voice had tightened and was no longer playful . She heard the sudden tension in it . So she obeyed , and when the heavy necklaces swung forward , she felt herself being drawn down as if someone had grabbed hold of them . But she only laughed and tried to adjust them . She lay back on the uncomfortable pillows , smoothing her dress down around her legs . Marvin stood staring at her . " Yes , like that . Like that . " He stood at the foot of the.bed , his hands closed about the two  | posts , watching her . She seemed to see him receding , and then coming closer , framed by the posts and the top of the bed ; she felt as if she were floating , drifting , in a kind of suspension that might have been her husband 's vision of her , weightless and holy . I am Elena Howe , she thought . Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes , and she did not see it . So many possessions , so many objects created out of love and bought and sold and sold again , expensive and beautiful and lost ! ? but she did not see them now . She saw her husband , a tall bulky man who carried himself well , his face partly shadowed , made stern now with love , almost stricken with love . He stared at her and she almost saw herself , his wife Elena . EIena Howe . On the first night of their marriage , when he had knelt above her and slowly , cautiously , and then in a kind of angry frenzy made love to her , helpless to control himself , she had lain like this and suddenly she felt herself inside his head , contained by the hard powerful skull , embraced totally , totally . If she cried out in pain or surprise she did not hear herself . She did not feel pain or surprise . And when he made love to her in the months afterward , she felt no pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , absolutely still , gentle , opened to him and empty , her soul flawless as the undersides of her eyelids seeing nothing . " Do you know how I love you , Elena ? " He seemed to be calling out to her across a great distance . Yet he was right at the foot of the bed , tense and watchful . Very close . I is mouth moved into a kind of smile . Stricken , staring . Elena smiled at him , her own face lying very lightly on the flesh of her skull . " Elena ? Do you . . . ? " She realized that she was expected to answer him . And so she whispered , " Yes , " and wondered if it was the right word , the magical word he wanted . Yes . Then she wondered , seeing his face , if he would hold himself back from her for a minute , two minutes , if he would finally come to her and bury himself in a sudden halfangry convulsive movement in her , inside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would go perfectly still inside his embrace , opening to him , his terrible , frantic , helpless energy . ' ' his either did or did not happen .  | I 'll be frank with you . Sometimes it 's as powerful as an explosion , but slowed down and dreamlike , strangely dreamlike , the sudden awareness of what is going to happen . When the future is suddenly clear . . . . Sometimes it 's as if I were high above the earth , alone in an airplane , able to see for myself the magical curve of the earth , which no one else has ever really seen . And I see it all  --  I see everything  --  with my body , my insides , the sensitive skin on the back of my neck  --  I see everything and I understand it , the terrible excitement of the truth . Then I know what will happen : exactly how the future will turn out . The present divides itself routinely and tamely into days , court sessions , recesses and breaks and weekends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep every night , the surface commotion of real life . But a point has been passed . Other people may sense this turning , this pivoting point . . . but I understand it ; in a way , I have contrived to bring it about , and my reward is the absolute certainty of what has been passed . So I can see into the future . I have sailed over that point like a man in an airplane , while everyone else is plodding along on the ground . I have felt it , taken it in with my guts , the subtlety of it , the feathery steel of its certainty . And I am never wrong . After that point I know not only that I have won but how well I have won , how deeply I have pushed myself into the imaginations of other people , how powerfully I have guided their wills . It only remains for enough days to pass in order for the fact of my victory to be realized  --  in what is called " real life . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . He turned heavily . I could hear him breathing , I could feel him sweating . It was about two o'clock . No , later . He sighed , his breath was raspy and impatient . Dreaming . He twitched violently , his leg jerked against me . In surprise my heart pounded . Was he run- ning somewhere ? Struggling with invisible enemies ? He sighed and the sigh became a groan . Then he jerked his entire body again : then he was awake . I lay in silence , not asleep . I heard his eyelashes parting , the stiff dry separation of the lashes . Awake . The mechanism of his brain had worked so violently that it had pushed itself out of sleep into consciousness . He was breathing thoughtfully , quietly , the breath of a man who is awake , making plans . I breathed softly , almost inaudibly , the breath of a woman who was asleep . But it 's good . The tension , the terrible power in me  --  I accept it , it 's a fact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep more than a few hours a night , any night , because I have too much to figure out . Some of it I do in my dreams ? in fact I get my best hunches in my dreams  --  but the rest I have to do at my desk  --  I need to get a pencil in my hand , I need to pick up a pencil in my fingers . So I ca n't waste time in bed , I have to get up . It seems to be getting more obvious as I grow older  --  the pattern of sleep and waking , of dreaming about work and then waking , suddenly , when the dream has fulfilled its function and I need now to think logically , cunningly . . . . What am I afraid of . . . ? Growing older ? No , absolutely not . No . In fact I am more certain of myself each year , more confident of my powers . When I was a young man the energy inside me , the insomnia , the sweating , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work for many hours a day  --  these things frightened me  --  but now I accept them all , I recognize them as a part of my personality , my self . I can count on that energy to give me a victory another man would not quite achieve , he 'd maybe come close to it but lose it , it would elude him because after all he would be only human , and I ... . I 'm a little different . No , I do n't fear old age or death , so I do n't fear any aspect of mortality . . . . Because . . . I think it 's because I 've already lived so many lives , I 've competed and fought and struggled and triumphed in so many lives , saving men from death , from long prison sentences , bringing them back to life again when everyone else wanted them destroyed . But I refused to let that happen , I refused , I fought to save them and I won . I won . And so in a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply into certain people than they did into their own souls , more in control of  | their destinies than they were themselves . . . . Once you know what that feeling is , once you taste it , you know that somehow you are immortal ; even if you die . You have been immortal . I felt the shifting of his weight in bed , the careful movement away from me . He did n't want me to wake up . In a minute , very carefully , he would ease himself out of bed and go away , away somewhere , another part of the house ... . ... like a mural meant to represent all of creation , an ancient mural , a great multitude of people drawn with meticulous detail , loving detail . . . a frieze around a temple showing processions that seem to go on for years , for centuries , vast crowds of people strung out in single file , all headed for the same destination .... I 'm all those people , one after another . My work is human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to love them ... in order to save them , I have to love them . He got up . I heard him at the bureau , pulling out one of the drawers  --  he would be taking out another pair of pajamas . He sweated so , always hot , restless , a big man with a gleaming restless body , a brain that would not stop . I loved him and yet I lay very still , as if hiding . On my side of the bed , hiding . I loved him but I dreaded the damp warm mattress where he had lain . I 'll be frank : no , I do n't want to change the world . I do n't want to reform the country . I do n't believe the courts are in existence for that purpose . I 'm not a reformer , I 'm not out to make our society into a paradise , I approach my clients one by one , as individuals . Now , there are certain cases , yes , obviously there are cases that must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law because of economic or racial pressures that you and I ca n't comprehend , and I need to explain this to a jury . I will explain it to a jury every time . . . unless I think that by explaining it I will be making a tactical error . I explain only as much of the truth as is necessary for a victory . Too much truth . . . is a tactical error . I do n't hit juries on the head with someone else 's misery , just to make them feel guilty , to displace the guilt , unless I need to for a victory . Everything is determined by that : what will assure me a victory . The rest is idealism , it 's selfish , it violates the right of my client to be represented only as himself , not as a member of a group . My clients are not ciphers , they do n't represent anyone except themselves . If I did n't see them that way I could n't love  | them . And if I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I do , and I could n't save them . He left the bedroom ; I felt the vibrations of his weight everywhere in the house , his footsteps , his pacing , his thinking . I thought : now I can sleep . From the time I was a child I felt the world was n't large enough for me . Even those vast spaces , the scrubland of Oklahoma ! No , I wanted somehow to make it expand into other dimensions , to force it into expansion . All my life I was made excited and miserable by my need to work , to work hard , harder than anyone else , to compete , to fight , to win  --  and only when I became a lawyer , a trial lawyer , did I really use that energy the way it was meant to be used . Just before a case opens I feel that my head is n't big enough for everything I 've put in it . I 'm a crowd ! I feel I 'm growing taller , I 'm shooting up toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will drive me mad if it does n't get out . I feel so strong , so very strong . . . . Does it embarrass you to hear a man confess his happiness in his work ? I think it does . Most men confess only their failures , their miseries ; they 're ashamed of their few moments of joy . Or maybe they do n't have any . . . ? Well , I do . I have many moments of joy , moments of almost unbearable happiness . Without him the bed was immense . Lonely . Cold . I reached over to feel that side of the mattress  --  yes , very damp , cold . The place where he had lain . I turned on the light and saw that it was after three o'clock . I pulled back the cover to look at the bed : a large damp stain where his body had been . No , I 'm not afraid to take risks . I 've taken many risks in the past , following my instincts , my dreams . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at . Being ridiculed . I want to stretch the boundaries a little , push the world out into another dimension , distort it , change it ; I 'm like anyone who takes chances and is n't afraid : let 's say like great conquerors , religious leaders , madmen . They told the great explorers of the oceans their ships would sail off the edge of the world  --  and the explorers replied , Why stay home because of that ? Why not sail off the edge of the world ? I thought : now I can sleep . But when I turned out the light I lay awake , my eyes open . I could hear him going downstairs . . . I could hear him down in his study . . . . But if I called him he would come back . He was still  | here with me ; in a way , he never left me , I was never alone . I had been married to him now for years and I was never alone , married to him , his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of him , there were people who would come to me if I called them . . . . My mother : my mother would come if I called . I never saw her now , I had n't seen her for a very long time , but if I called her in this darkness she would come , approaching the bed , saying , Elena ? Do you want me ? There was a concentration of shadow that could have been my mother . And I could summon my father . . . . I could call him to me , to the side of the bed , I could draw him forward to me , I could look into that face of his again , into that expression of pure pitiless love ... . You call it the Establishment  --  all right , I call it tradition . I happen to believe in the status quo . I 'm a maverick , but I respect the tradition I operate in . The tradition makes me possible , it makes my victories possible . . . . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I operate in them , I. . . . And now you part company with me , do n't you ? I can see it in your expression ! But I granted you this interview because I respect the magazine you work for , though I do n't respect its political bias , and I wo n't stop telling the truth just because . . . . Yes , I know what you 're thinking : there is n't any need for you to protest . I know exactly what you 're thinking . But I 'm asking you to listen to my point of view , because it 's a point of view that gets very little publicity these days . These days , every kid out of school who goes into criminal law thinks he can reform the country , turn things upside down , by using his clients as wedges , levers . . . . Men like that have no real respect for the law . They jeopardize the law , its sanctity , and that is a terrible thing . We need the law because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who want to crucify Christ in every generation want to crucify the law now , now that Christ is dead and buried ? no , never mind about my personal religious beliefs , that is n't the issue here . The churches are being destroyed , all right , maybe God Himself is destroying them , no matter . I 'm not a theologian . I 'm not a religious man . But the courts are not going to be destroyed . No . They 'll stand . They are what 's left of divinity and not even a murderer would want to destroy divinity  --  not the last of it  --  even  | a murderer would draw back in reverence . We need what 's holy . The law is holy . It will never be destroyed because there is no salvation outside it . I lay awake , not sleeping ; I thought of him downstairs . . . a homely handsome man , perspiring , excited , his face gleaming . . . . Pawing through papers , transcripts , notes , photostated copies of documents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . I could not understand him . I never tried , now , to understand him . He was a man so alive , alive . . . . Alive , living . . . . I had felt a thousand times the terrible leap of his life in me , deep in my body . I move on . The men who are my opponents one day are my friends the next day . I do n't hate . I do n't have time to hate . Enemies of mine exist all over the country , yes , certainly , but I do n't remember who they are . . . I do n't have time for them . I do n't hate anyone and I do n't hate myself . You look surprised . . . but hating oneself is very popular today . Hating this country . Hating history . It 's a complex way of hating oneself . But I accept myself : this is my personality . My fate . I accept myself thoroughly , in fact I admire myself . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I insist upon telling the truth . I love hearing my own voice  --  I love the way people are forced to look at me , sometimes against their will , not just juries but ordinary spectators in a courtroom , spectators anywhere . . . . I love those people when they look at me , when they listen . There is a great joy , a miraculous joy , in the power of words as they flow among people . . . the emotions , the currents and waves that hook human beings together . . . like molecules bouncing off one another and colliding with others , a ceaseless , eternal motion , a divinity . . . . Yes , this must be what it is to be divine . This must be what it is to be divine . " Suppose someone wanted to destroy you , would that be easy ? " Elena indicated that she did not know .  | " People think it would be easy , very easy , but it would n't be ? that 's where I come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct from just killing a human being , is very challenging . " The man smiled into Elena 's face , a smile flashing of excitement and confidence . Very quick , deft , alert . He moved closer to her , stooping from his height , trying to make himself heard over the noise of other conversations . " That 's where I cone in , my profession is based upon how well murderers meet that challenge , and they do n't do well at all  --  they 're very clumsy , they do n't have much imagination . How would you destroy a body ? " Elena laughed in amazement . Then she said , seeing his seriousness , " I do n't know . " " But think , think ! What is the first thing that conies into your mind ? ? burning , fire ? A fire that would seem accidental ? " " I do n't know , " Elena said . Someone passed close behind her and Elena had to step forward , and the man pressed nervously toward her , still staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he smiled again , a happy boyish smile that illuminated his face . " Let 's say someone wanted to destroy you , Mrs. Howe , and strangled you , and set the house on fire  --  then what ? Then what ? " It was the spring of 1965 . A reception somewhere in Detroit : thousands of squares of highly polished parquet , a floor that gleamed cruelly , beautifully , each square reflecting light in a way distinct from the others . Different angles of light . Different tones of light . Jarring , warring , yet set in harmony , beneath the feet of these hundreds of people who did not glance down . Elena could see their faint shadowy reflections there , in the floor . While she smiled she felt her gaze drift downward , to her own reflection ? there , there in the floor  --  beneath her feet , another person , waiting and listening and perhaps not smiling . " Ha ! " the man said cheerfully . " You think fire would work , do you ? Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how violent the fire was  --  burned , charred to a crisp , just a blackened mass , a few ounces of ashes  --  still you 'd remain Mrs. Howe , and I could sift through whatever was left and come out with the evidence for an absolute identification . Once the identity of the victim is known , it 's almost always easy to find the murderer . An anonymous corpse is a terrible problem . But who  | can remain anonymous ? There 's a young man working for me , a specialist in forensic odontology , who is so brilliant  --  so painstaking ? he could identify someone if all you handed him were a few teeth , or part of a bridgework , or an old gold filling ! Just hand it to him , put it in the palm of his hand , and come back in a few days  --  it 's astonishing ! " Another man was trying to join their conversation , approaching Elena from the right . She sensed him coming , turned with a vague encouraging smile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the subtle , almost imperceptible rhythmic break in a conversation that allows another person to enter . The man who was talking so eagerly to Elena hesitated ; he said , with a forced smile , " Hello , Judge Couteau  --  how are you ? This is very crowded , is n't it ? I was just telling Mrs. Howe some professional secrets ? " Elena glanced around and saw her husband in another group : she fixed him there , in that place . He would usually remain in one place for most of the duration of a reception like this  --  other people drifted to him , around him , finally past him , but he would remain on a few square feet of floor . He was talking vehemently with two men , one of whom Elena recognized  --  an assistant for the tax attorney Marvin had hired a few months ago to represent him in ' Fax Court ; the Treasury Department was making certain claims on Marvin 's income , a complicated case Elena did not understand and had made no attempt to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face shifted into its easiest expression , a half-formal , halfgirlish smile . She was somewhere in Detroit , in a large hall-like room , with a polished floor and banks of flowers and waiters in white suits making rounds with trays of drinks , black waiters in white suits . Someone was talking to her . Toward her . At her . No , about her : she must listen . " Yes , I was telling Mrs. Howe that nobody could really destroy her , every inch of her , " the man was saying . " Unless he was a real professional , of course . . . . Take another example : simple burial , in a lonely place , with the hope of decomposition . This was much more popular in the past ! But now we have so much land dug up , you know , new housing developments and shopping plazas and ? It 's very hard to find a good lonely grave , just six feet or so that  | wo n't be bulldozed up in a few months ? Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl , please ! ? we 're not in court ! " Couteau said graciously . He winked at Elena . A handsome graying man , in a suit with stylishly narrow lapels , a shirt of peppermint stripes ; Elena noticed pearl cuff links . " Just to remove all traces of a body 's sex , for instance  --  is not easy . If you trust decomposition , the so-called natural process of decay , it wo n't work  --  and if you put lime on the body , like people in novels and movies , it will in fact help to preserve the body . Did you know that ? " " Yes , " Couteau said . " I meant Mrs. Howe , " the man said coldly . " I did n't know that , " Elena said . " Yes . And you 'd remain a female for quite a while after you were dead and even partly decomposed , did you know that ? Let 's say your murderer was very industrious and cut you up into chunks and buried the chunks all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what do I do ? I simply examine the bones , to begin with , and I can tell the police immediately what your sex is . Not to mention the womb ? " " The what ? " Couteau asked , sipping at his drink . " The womb . In female bodies that have almost totally decomposed  --  I mean that seriously , almost totally decomposed  --  you can often find the womb , the womb remains when all the other organs have disappeared . " Elena smiled . No , she did n't smile . In a sudden helpless panic , she stared at the man who was speaking but did not hear his words . Then she did smile , to show her interest and surprise and ... . Judge Couteau was now talking . A waiter passed behind him and he had to step forward ; he glanced around irritably , holding his glass close to his chest so that he would not brush it against Elena . A crowd of people , not countable . But yes : countable . If Elena had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the squares of parquet if she had time . If she had time she could count the lights in the ceiling , the pairs of eyes , the fillings in all the teeth . She had begun to shiver . But Couteau was talking to her , leaning over her . By a steady almost imperceptible movement of his right elbow he was exclud- ing the other man , almost unconsciously , slowly , half-inch by halfinch , moving that arm and that elbow and finally that shoulder around , subtly , gently , perhaps not consciously , while the other man sipped nervously at his drink and drew in his breath to speak , but found no opening . Elena gazed past Couteau 's slim gray arm and noticed the man 's odd curved incisors , which seemed a slightly different color  --  not so white  --  from the rest of his teeth . That was the day I learned about my body : they said the womb would n't rot . Then how could you get rid of it ? They did n't say it would shrivel up without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They said it would not rot , would not burn , would not go away , would remain like a shoe buckle or part of someone 's bridgework or one of those small fossil fish you can buy for a few dollars to set up on a rack in your husband 's study , on display like a cup and saucer . I was very cold but I did n't shiver . Now this was 1965 . The ceiling of the large elegant room was made of a white substance , something that appeared to be very light , like hardened foam , a mysterious synthetic substance like a hardened cloud ; nothing Elena recognized . She was thinking about her moist elastic womb located somewhere deep inside her body , but where ? ? Judge Couteau was talking to her , with his graceful agreeable smile ; she was grateful for him , for his talking , because it would not be necessary for her to reply ; he would not really expect her to reply , only to listen . She must listen . Another man joined them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , his large fingers closed about his glass . Judge Couteau made way for him . Now there were several men , and Elena knew she would be safe : no need to talk . She allowed her gaze to shift upward , up to the ceiling , which was not as corncomplicated as the floor . No shadows there , no reflections , no shapes like human beings . . . . But there were many lights , fluorescent lights buried in the ceiling , almost concealed , hidden . All corners of the big room were illuminated equally . Perhaps there was a quiet , omnipotent hum from the fluorescent lighting , but Elena could not hear it . Somewhere a giant air-conditioning unit was humming , vibrating , but Elena could not hear it . People moved  | slowly about this room , drifting from one area of parquet squares to another , smiling , talking , recognizing one another , safe with one another , moving from one part of the floor to another . Everything was countable . There was no need to feel panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own petition for habeas corpus that was two thousand pages long ! Two thousand pages ! His life story , a pile of papers that began with the date of his birth , sometime in the twenties  --  the whole thing written by hand , bad spelling , bad grammar , sentences that began nowhere and ended two or three pages later , all mixed up and messy , things scratched out , notes in the margins and unnumbered pages of what he called an appendix ' at the end ? Now does n't that make you wonder , really , how the prisons are being run ? A man with so much free time , evidently years of free time , not to mention the supplies and someone 's obvious encouragement  --  to write a two-thousand-page book nobody is going to read ? ! Jesus ! Who 's in charge , just who 's in charge ? That 's the question I would like to ask and there 'll be some pretty red faces around this state if I get around to asking it ? " " Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going to Washington , but I am not abandoning Michigan ; I am never going to abandon Michigan . " The conversation jumped to a new topic : a Detroit man who had campaigned for the Democratic nomination for governor of the state , who had spent all his money and his wife 's money , but no one knew how much , not even within ten thousand dollars , who had lost badly and was not at this cocktail reception , though his son-in-law was here . The son-in-law was drunk . Mrs. Couteau joined them , sliding her arm through her husband 's . She was small , compact , with a smooth powdered face that showed no wrinkles , no expression but mild pleasure . She was pleased . She was agreeable . She interrupted the conversation to say something  --  as she spoke , Elena noticed that she began to appear rather hard-eyed , so Elena allowed her gaze to shift away again  --  something about a newly elected criminal court judge , not here because he had not been invited , whose name was Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been an ordinary lawyer  --  on the basis of his name , the popular appeal of his name . And he had won .  | " Are you serious ? " the man with the pouched eyes cried . Yes , serious . O'Gorman and his wife and friends believed that his name on a ballot would look good , just the look of it ; he had even explained this to the bar association , sincerely and earnestly , even modestly ; he had no background in public work , he really knew nothing , but he thought he would stand for an election . . . . The bar had not endorsed him . But he had run for office and had won by a large majority . The conversation drifted back to the man who had tried for the Democratic nomination for governor , who .. . Elena drew her breath in slowly , as if testing herself . Yes , she felt better now . She was safe now . She glanced over to where her husband stood  --  and he was still there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax lawyer looked heated , distressed . Marvin 's complexion was ruddy . Around them were slow-drifting groups of people , the women with air-blown hair , shining and perfect , their arms bared , a few of them with their shoulders bared , smooth and flesh-toned as women in expensive portraits . Primed , heated , quick to laugh , to agree to laugh . Practiced in smiles . Teeth were shown without hesitation , in delight , because they were perfect teeth . Most of the women were beautiful ; impeccable . Perhaps not beautiful but handsome , agreeable , with their perfect spontaneous smiles and their stiff lacquered hair . Their lips appeared to be lacquered also , moving ceaselessly to shape words and smiles . Elena noticed a very striking young woman in a long floor-length dress of green velvet , the front slashed to the waist and fastened together by silver spikes . " What does Marvin think of him , Elena ? " " I 'm not sure ... I do n't know .... " Mrs. Couteau lit a cigarette and blew smoke energetically around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . A black man in a freshly laundered white outfit was on the perimeter of Elena 's group , asking them something in an earnest voice . More drinks ? Yes , said Couteau . Yes , said the sad-eyed man , with a grin . Do n't think I 'd better , said Couteau 's wife . Elena still held her drink , the ice cubes melted into a tepid brown-beige liquid , no thank you , nothing . Elena 's gaze met the black man 's by  | accident and both were opaque , unseeing , not an exchange of looks but a collision of blind stares , coming together in the space between them and then going motionless , dead . Certain people can not see each other ; they cancel each other out . Around her neck she wore one of the antique gold necklaces Marvin had given her ; a heavy , ponderous gold , very beautiful . It was a weight she had to combat . It pulled one way and she pulled another way . Mrs. Couteau was admiring it . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough not to come too close . Mrs. Couteau could touch it with one perfect polished nail ; but not the man . . . . Though he almost touched it with his forefinger . He said : Elena thanked them both . That day I learned from them about the immortality of the womb : you ca n't kill it . There were other things to learn but I could n't concentrate . I was very cold . I was eager to be taken home , to go home with my husband , to be safe at home . . . but then I thought , what if I ca n't sleep , what if I feel it inside me , the little uncurled-out sac inside me ... . My mother once said , You do n't want children , you do n't have the figure for it . Your pelvis is too small . Do n't ruin yourself . More guests pushed into the room , the air was noisy and smoky and very happy , and Elena felt a sudden rush of happiness herself , a knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and that she would be privileged in a short while to be taken home . She wanted to go home , she was almost greedy now for that house , for her husband and that house . . . . So many cheerful people ! It would take a lifetime to know them all . Elena was very safe among them , standing on a few squares of the parquet floor , one of the younger women , with her blond hair in a thick gleaming coil and her neck in a comfortable tension , pulling against the weight of that necklace . She had not moved very far all evening . Other people moved slowly from group to group , always changing the composition of the room , but the room itself was ultimately finite and the people crowded in it were finite . A game might be in session , involving parquet squares like squares on a chess board , peo- ple like players who had come bravely out onto the board to risk themselves , in person , but Elena did n't know its rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finite safety of the world , its countable parts . " I see Marvin hit the newspapers the other night , " someone said . " Were you frightened ? Lucky he was home ! " " Oh yes , " said Mrs. Couteau , " what happened ? Someone broke into your house ? " A man had climbed over the wall a few evenings before , and the dogs had attacked him . Elena had heard the barking , the snarling , a man 's screams . When she ran out the front door she saw a man on his knees on the sidewalk , begging her to call off the dogs ? then Marvin ran out behind her The man had n't been hurt badly , a few small bleeding wounds . He began to cry while they waited for the police ; he told Marvin that he was desperate , that he had wanted to talk to him , to Marvin Howe , but had n't been able to get an appointment ; he was desperate because he had been arrested by two vice squad detectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would swear he was innocent . . . . He 'd been picked up in a bar when a man standing beside him asked him a question he had not heard exactly , and he had replied , " I think so . . . . " The man turned out to be a plainclothes detective and he and another plainclothesman had arrested the man right there , and he was innocent and desperate for someone to help him ... . " A familiar story , " Couteau said contemptuously . " Is Marvin going to press charges ? " " No , " Elena said , surprised . She hesitated . She had thought this story would evoke other responses ; now she saw she had been mistaken . She said slowly , " No , he went to see him in the hospital .. . he gave him the name of someone in Legal Aid .... " " Marvin should press charges , " a man said flatly . " That 's the kind of attitude I do n't like . I hate to criticize your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And is n't breaking and entering more serious after dark ? " " That law was just changed , " Couteau said . " Well , it is more serious after dark , the law should n't have been  | changed . That law was based on something quite profound . I 'm surprised at Marvin Howe . " " When was the law changed ? " " It was n't being enforced anyway . " " That does n't make any difference ? " A woman in a black dress came over to Elena and claimed her . She was middle-aged , kindly ; she said , " Elena Howe ! I have n't seen you for a long time , dear , how are you ? I was just talking to Marvin and telling him there is someone I must introduce you to ? " Elena disengaged herself from the group she was in and allowed herself to be led somewhere . People made way for her and the woman , whose name she did not recall ; people glanced at Elena Howe and stepped aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark outfit , with a dark turtleneck sweater instead of a shirt , smiling at them . The woman was chattering about something but Elena could n't hear her because of the din in the room . She felt the fierce flamelike leap of attention from people , and then the recoiling from this attention , the men tilting the ice cubes in their glasses and then going polite again , tame , no threat to her or to anyone , not on the square feet of this floor . " This woman is fascinating , and I know she 'd love to meet you , " the woman in black was saying over her shoulder . " I 've been trying to get you together  --  you 'd be perfect for her interview show ? " The woman led Elena to a couple , a man and a woman she did n't recognize ; evidently they were joining the very end of a conversation . The man was saying , " Rape ca n't be a very serious crime , it happens every twenty minutes or so around here .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharp , to a man named Homer Tate . She gathered that they were not here together , they were not really a couple . The woman , Marya , was about Elena 's height , quite slender for a woman of her age  --  she must have been in her forties  --  and very pretty , with her chestnut hair fluffed up and out , the colors of her face pink and a light , even tan . She smiled at Elena and said , " I 'm very pleased to meet you , Mrs. Howe . " Elena stared : there was something familiar about this woman . " I 'm very pleased to meet you . . . " she said . The woman in black was saying enthusiastically , " Would n't she be perfect for your show , Marya ? People are so curious about  | Marvin ! There 's so much local interest in him , so much local pride , just think of all the people who would turn on your show just because of the subject ? " " The women I interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marya Sharp said . " Yes , but there is such an interest in this , I mean , the problems of being married to ? I mean , the excitement of it and even the danger ? " the woman said falteringly . Elena looked at Marya Sharp 's face and saw it shift slowly into the face of someone she knew . Ardis ? She stepped back in surprise . The woman in black glanced at her but did not stop talking . " ? such a shame , Marya , to rule out a wonderful interview like this  --  are you sure ? I mean , are you positive ? Because ? " Marya smiled ironically at Elena . Sternly . She made a slight nodding motion with her head , very slight : . Yes . Yes . Do n't stare at me . " Well , there might be a possibility , " Marya said slowly . " It goes against the principles of my program , but . . . . Let 's talk , Mrs. Howe . " She took Elena 's arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Excuse us , " she said to the woman and the man she had been talking with , who both stared . " Stupid damn bores , " she muttered to Elena . Elena walked blindly . She had not seen her mother for a long time . " Elena , my God , do you have to gape at me like an idiot ? " Marya whispered . " You certainly knew who I was , did n't you ? My television name ? " " No  --  I mean , she did n't say who  --  I did n't ? " " You knew I was getting a television show at last , did n't you ? " " The last time we talked you did n't know yet ? " " Well , it came through finally . Do n't you follow anything up on your own ? You must have seen the notices in the paper  --  do n't you even read the television page ? " " Yes , sometimes , but ? " They were near one of the walls , beside a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded in two . A vase containing  | pink and red roses was tilted a little , half on the tablecloth and half on the table . Elena felt the impulse to right it . " Elena , you are so disappointing ! " Marya sighed . Elena 's face burned . " Anyway , the show materialized just as I had hoped it would , right down to the name I 've taken on  --  Marya Sharp  --  and the format I wanted , everything . I 'm being sponsored by Lovecore , the cosmetics , and the first two shows went perfectly  --  you mean you did n't even watch ? " " I did n't know about it , " Elena said . " I 'm so sorry  --  Marvin has been very busy and ? " " You just do n't pay attention to your environment , " Marya said . " I would have thought you 'd be proud of me . But anyway , now that you 're not so shocked , you look very well  --  I 'm pleased you still wear your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a woman needs a perfect face for that kind of hairdo ? I 've been watching you off and on here , and I 've liked what I 've seen , " Marya said critically . " But that color , that pink , is n't right for you . Did Marvin pick out that dress ? I hate pink ; you should avoid it . How are you ? I 'm sorry I did n't call you back . I almost called you when I saw that item in the paper , about somebody robbing your house , but anyway , how are you ? Happy ? " Elena said dizzily , " Yes , yes ... I 'm very busy . . . . I 'm taking a course in art appreciation . . . an adult-education course at the Rackham Building . . . . And I 'm going through my old French textbooks again , you know I had two years in high school and I 'd like to be able to read and translate . . . there are essays in French Marvin sometimes needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good , " Marya said , pleased . " But are n't you going to congratulate me ? Everyone tells me my show is going well . " " Oh , yes , " Elena said , risking a smile now that her mother was not so critical , in fact smiling happily , " yes , that 's wonderful . Marvin will be very pleased too . I do n't think he knows about it either ? I mean , I did n't know what your name was going to be , I do n't think you mentioned it , so even if I had read about the show  --  even if I ? If I happened to see the show I might not have ? You look so different , I ? " " Well , Robie made me a present of two weeks in Dallas , in this lovely mansion down there , before my show began . They did a  | nice job , " Marya said , patting her face and running one finger back behind her ear thoughtfully . " The operation on the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fly clients out to a ranch by helicopter , for horseback riding , and I met some fascinating people there . Even a man , a ninety-two-year-old Texan , he said it was his third time , he had everything done including the buttocks , " Marya said . " What a crazy world ! As for my hair , it looks like hell yet . " " I think it looks very nice , " Elena said . " No . It 's all my own hair , and much too thin . They were bleaching it back in degrees , you know , because I had black hair for a while , and one morning when I brushed it it started coming out . It was horrible . . . . I thought it might be the end of me . It came out in handfuls , it was horrible . . . . So now I have to be very careful . " Elena stared at Marya . It crossed her mind that this woman was not her mother after all . Her mother 's voice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was n't that a joke , that terrible woman bringing you over to meet me ! " Marya laughed . " She 's been telling me for weeks she 'd like to introduce me to a young friend of hers , Marvin Howe 's wife ? and I tried to stop her , I made excuses  --  but she has to have her own way , constantly ; the wives of all these millionaires make me sick ! ? they think they 're everyone 's mother , they must do favors for people and coerce them into things . She tried to introduce me to some bachelor , too , some cousin of hers , but I managed to avoid that . By the way , Elena , you know Robie is n't too well . " " You said something on the telephone  --  an operation ? " " Two operations in two months , for ulcers . The poor bastard , he 's lost a lot of weight , you know he asks me about you and wonders why Marvin does n't bring you to the Club . Marvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while  --  or does n't he mention that to you ? So Robie ca n't figure out why he never sees you . But I tried to explain to him that your husband is very guarded with you , he wants to keep little Elena for himself , does n't he ? ? but of course he 's perfectly right . I 'm surprised he even lets you take adult-education courses . " " He would n't mind if you and I saw each other now , " Elena said , " I mean . . . so many years have passed . . . . I could come  | down to your studio and watch your show , maybe , or we could have lunch together . . . . I 'd like to talk to you about something .... " Marya shook her head , smiling . " I do n't think so , Elena , really . Marvin does n't want you to be influenced by me . " " But he would n't mind now , I could ask him , " Elena said quickly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... " " No , Elena , really . He made his feelings known when he married you . I ca n't go against his wishes . " " But ? " " Elena , do n't be so stubborn ! You 're very sweet and very lovely , but you 're still stubborn and you 've got to grow up . You 're his wife now . You 're not my daughter , I mean not officially , we have two quite different names now .... In fact , Marvin offered me money to leave this area , but I refused , I told him absolutely that I would not interfere in your life . And I have n't . " " When was this ? " Elena asked . " Before the wedding . He took me out for drinks , to the Top of the Flame on a thundery afternoon , and he was awfully nervous , like a bridegroom . In fact he was a bridegroom  --  at his age . . . . He talked for a very long time and I became quite sympathetic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the past . Of course he knows about everything , your father and even that man in Cleveland , you know , the man who owned the apartment building . . . and he said , frankly , he was n't pleased with it all , he did n't want me influencing you any longer . He was very frank . He said I should keep in contact with you , mainly by phone , and arrange to see you once in a while  --  because you would want that  --  but our meetings were to be very rare . Of course I agreed with him . It was necessary to agree . " " I did n't know about this , " Elena said faintly . " People do n't say no to your husband , " Marya said . " Really , by the time he finishes talking , you believe he must be right . You might start out disagreeing , but you end up agreeing . . . you just ca n't remember your own arguments . And he is right about this , really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad you did n't leave the city , " Elena said . " No , I like Robie and my other friends here and of course this television show is very exciting for me . It 's an entirely new adven- ture . So I do n't resent Marvin ; in fact , he and I are almost friends now . . . . Of course , if he does n't bring you down to the Club , I understand why . He 's quite right . Did he ever tell you how he checked us out ? " Marya said , lowering her voice . " You mean with a detective ? " " A detective ! A whole agency , Elena ! " Marya laughed . " He must have spent thousands of dollars . He knew every fact about you , honey , even doctors ' files right up to a few weeks before the wedding  --  I do n't know how on earth he got them , if his men broke in the offices and took pictures , or if they paid some doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very much , honey . What more could you want in a husband ? " " Nothing , " Elena said slowly . " What more could you want out of life ? So please , Elena , do n't endanger your own marriage by talking to him about me . When we meet I 'll be Marya Sharp . You 're a lovely girl , " Marya said fondly , " but , frankly ... well . . . at this point in my career I do n't really want a grown-up daughter .... Do you understand ? " Elena was looking at the vase . But her stare did not quite take it in , she could n't really see it . " You should n't agitate for trouble , " Marya said . " What more could you want , with the life you and Marvin lead ? " " Nothing , " Elena said . 1 Hurtled across the landscape , picked up in one place and set down in another . . . at the back of his mind he carried me , he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still . I never thought about the faces offered to him  --  not just the women , but the men , the crowds of people , all those strangers . I never thought about losing him . Elena sat alone at the dining-room table , reading a postcard from her husband . He was involved in a malpractice suit in Phoenix ; the  | trial was in its second week . Elena read and reread the harsh hurried scrawl . On the back of the card was a slick , brightly colored picture of desert and mountains , spiny trees that held their limbs up like arms , praying , pleading . The colors were bright blue and bright orange-red and green ; the green of the cactus trees seemed stamped on the outlines of the trees , not convincing . Elena stared at the picture for a while . She touched one of the cactus trees , outlining it slowly with her finger . When he was away from home he telephoned her twice a day : once in the morning , once in the evening . Sometimes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the card before her and glanced through the other mail : two small white envelopes , invitations , a large envelope from one of the Detroit organizations Marvin was associated with , a brochure explaining the 1967-68 plans for one of the companies Marvin had investments in , many advertisements , magazines , a notice from one of the charities Elena belonged to , her name and address stamped on the envelope . . . . Then a letter from Miami Beach , addressed to Mrs. Marvin Howe , a handwritten letter . Elena pulled this envelope out of the pile of mail and studied the handwriting . It did not look familiar ; it was ordinary , very neat . It was a woman 's handwriting . Elena thought , I can open this or not open it . It was addressed to Mrs. Marvin Howe correctly . The number on Lakeshore Drive was correct . She watched herself turn the letter in her hands several times , and then start to open it , slowly , not tearing the envelope ; evidently she was going to read the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to read this . . . . She took the small note-sized piece of stationery out of the envelope and for a few minutes looked at it , without reading it . Then , almost against her will , she began to read : Ask him about Ursula down in Miami Beach . Do you dare ask him . Your husband is no stranger to this Ursula . Observe his face carefully . Elena read this several times . Behind her the house was silent , comfortable with age , many rooms of quiet , stilled air . The walls were thick . Even the layers of wallpaper were thick , layers of tissue- like skin upon skin , to slow everything down . Elena read the note again , slowly . If she were to glance up her eye would skid effortlessly along the gleaming table to the black and gold wallpaper and to an ornate engraved clock . She placed this note before her , next to Marvin 's card . She leaned forward and looked from one to the other . 2 In the classroom at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , the fourth desk in the center row . She had come to that desk by instinct , automatically , on the first day ; the other students sat in different desks from time to time , but Elena always took the same desk . She opened her notebook to the notes she had taken on the last lecture . The next page was blank and she wrote at the top of it : February 11 , 1969 ? Professor Brauer ? " What You Should Know About Real Estate Transactions . " This was her class in law , " Law for Laymen , " and they were to have read a chapter on real-estate transactions that week . Dr. Brauer was late : he told them he had to drive all the way from Ann Arbor , so he was often late . The class met each Thursday at 4:15 but it rarely began at 4:15 . The man who sat next to Elena said to her , " You know where he is ? He 's across the street in a bar . " Elena smiled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time Dr. Brauer hurried in it was 4:35 . He was carrying a briefcase stuffed with books and papers , too full to close , and he slammed this down on the podium at the front of the room . He looked harried , impatient . He looked around the room once , twice , then quickly into the center at Elena ; then he began his lecture in brief explosive sentences , while he stared out the window . " He was over in the bar at three-thirty . This time I 'm going to report him , " the man beside Elena whispered angrily . At 5:20 the instructor shoved up his sleeve and looked at his watch and anounced that the class was over . But as the students put on their coats and began to leave the room he remained standing at the podium and seemed to be gazing toward Elena , with an odd neutral smile . He was not a friendly man . He said abruptly , " Now do you know what you should know about real-estate transactions , Mrs. Howe ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . He walked out the door with her . In the corridor he said , " Do you have a way to get home , or what ? ? do you need a ride any-where ? " " No thank you , " Elena said . " Okay , " he said , and walked away . Was it sometime in February , that day ? What did I look like ? Was I looking toward the door , waiting for the instructor to walk in the room ? Was I sitting there not looking at anything , just sitting in the center of that room ... ? Was I waiting for someone to see me ? Who did I look like ? 3 She leafed through the French grammar until she came to the chapter on the subjunctive , then she looked up the imperfect subjunctive . She had memorized all this but she did n't want to trust her memory ; she was translating an article for Marvin . It was all familiar , the endings , the - sse , - sses , " t , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had been working for several hours on the translation , which was a study by a French pharmicologist on the variations in tissue reactions to certain types of poison . She forced herself to go very slowly , meticulously , rereading what she had translated after each sentence , to see if it all seemed logical . It was 2:30 in the afternoon and she was alone in the house ; she had hours ahead in which to work , before he came home at 7:oo . If the telephone rang late in the afternoon it would probably mean he would be late , but he would be home sometime that evening and she had all the hours between 2:30 and that time for this work . She reread part of a paragraph : ... all that remained of the alleged Mlle Legere was some decomposed soft tissues hidden in lime ; all the bones and head had been removed , and never located ; the only useful evidence was the isolation of a poison ( hyoscine ) , some hair , and a birthmark miraculousy preserved on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... .  | Elena was pleased with this , so far , though she rechecked a few words . She rechecked a verb ending . But the words seemed to flow smoothly and mechanically enough and she was satisfied that she could go on . 4 " ' We are trying to conserve nature . . . we feel that time is running out . " " What do you say to charges that you are operating against the interests of certain businesses ? ? that you 're therefore endangering the jobs of workingmen ? " " We are trying to establish priorities . What matters most is the preservation of the planet and of the species as a whole , not isolated individuals and their money and their jobs . . . . We feel that time is running out . " Marya was interviewing an attractive middle-aged woman , who talked nervously and kept glancing at the camera or at something behind the camera . Marya spoke in careful sentences and she smiled often to encourage the other woman . Her hair appeared stiff as a helmet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made Elena think of the poise of a long-necked bird , patient and ready to strike . Marvin was looking up from the papers on his lap . " Your mother is giving that woman a hard time , is n't she ? " " Is she ? I do n't know . I thought she was being very nice tonight . " " She 's made the woman very nervous . " Elena had not noticed this . " Our appeal is simply to people to use their common sense .. . to withdraw their financial support from certain products .... " " An economic boycott ? " " Well , yes , an economic boycott . . . . But what is more important , the selling of fur coats or the preservation of the species of certain animals ? Wild animals like the leopard and the tiger , the cheetah , and other lovely wild animals are being destroyed for their skins and are in danger of becoming extinct . . . . There are sixty endangered species today and if they are allowed to die out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " You are arguing more generally , though , against the wearing of furs ? " " Oh yes , yes , absolutely , the wearing of any kind of fur is unnecessary , and therefore immoral , but the wearing of these particular furs should be prohibited by law . " Marya frowned and was silent for a moment . Then she said slowly , " I 'm sorry , but I ca n't help but disagree with you . I know my views will seem shocking to you , and probably to many of our viewers , but I ca n't agree with everything you 've said . I want to make a very clear , controversial statement . I think that furs are lovely , worn by men and women both . I do n't think there is anything lovelier than furs . It 's part of human history that human beings have subjugated all the animals and have chosen to wear the furs and hides of certain animals , it 's a statement about something .... I 'm not sure what I mean but my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , wearing the fur of an animal , is justified . " On screen , the woman stared at Elena 's mother , speechless . Marya went on thoughtfully : " The more beautiful she is , the more justified . " " Your mother is a very strange woman , " Marvin said with admiration . 5 Marvin took off his overcoat and let it fall onto the leather sofa . He went to make himself a drink . Elena watched his back , the brusque motions of his arms , the rigidity of his body . Without turning toward her he asked , " What did you do today , Elena ? " " I stayed home . " " Did n't you have a luncheon to go to ? " " It was cancelled . " " Oh . Was it . That 's good . You 're happiest at home , are n't you , " he said vaguely . Elena looked at his overcoat and wondered if she should pick it up . . . . But that might annoy him . He was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , he did n't mind a mess , he sometimes liked a mess . He did n't want her waiting on him , he said . So she looked at the coat but did n't touch it . " You did n't listen to the news tonight , did you ? " " The six-o'clock news ? " Elena said . " No . " Marvin sat heavily on the edge of the sofa and raised his glass  | to his mouth . Elena waited . His face was flushed ; Elena guessed he had been drinking on the way home . That day he had been in court , conducting the defense of a Detroit manufacturer , a man who had been indicted for conspiracy to defraud his investors . Elena stared at him , waiting . She was quite certain the trial was not over yet , it had n't been that far along , and so Marvin could not have lost . That could n't be it . But something might have happened in court today that meant he could lose . . . . Or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : one day he had come home upset , like this , and Elena found out a few days later that a woman had run up to Marvin in court and attacked him , screaming at him , and had had to be dragged out . Marvin had refused to press charges or to talk to reporters . Elena had never asked him about it ; she knew it had nothing to do with her . . . . Another time , a national newsmagazine had published a long interview with him , a really vicious article Elena had come across by accident in the Grosse Pointe library a month after it had come out . Beneath a photograph of Marvin and her  --  Marvin looking older than he really was , Elena looking younger  --  had been the caption , " Millionaire Lawyer Howe &; Wife : Claims of Divinity ? " Marvin had never said anything to Elena about the article and Elena had never said anything to him . " Elena , come here , " he said . He pressed his face against her and held her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he murmured , " I left home around seven . . . and then what did you do , dear ? .. . I want to know what you did so that I can imagine you here by yourself , here , just you , I do n't want to think about anyone else tonight . . . . Talk to me , dear . Talk to me. " 6 " If you relax it wo n't hurt as much , " the doctor said . Elena relaxed . The nurse , a girl of about twenty , in a stiff white cap , smiled nervously down at Elena . Closing her eyes , talking to herself about that part of her body , detaching herself from it , making it numb , only an idea . . . . She instructed her brain to annihilate it , inch by inch , and now the surrounding tissue , all the tissue going nerveless and relaxed , limp , asleep . She had been gripping the edge of the table ; she considered  | her fingers one by one , loosening them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand went numb . She felt a stab of pain . But no , nothing ; it went blank again . Another current of pain , high inside her . " . . . almost over , " the doctor said . Elena closed her eyes again . She felt the nurse 's presence , close to her , almost an irritant ; better for her to be alone without another woman in the room . Then it was over . The nurse was wiping blood off an instrument . Her face was strained , as if she had experienced the pain Elena had not . There , so deep in there , no sensation but what you imagine : you must imagine everything . Back in the doctor 's office , sitting in front of his desk , Elena kept seeing the blood , the blood-soaked tissue ; the doctor was talking cheerfully . " Most women get tense for even these routine examinations , and then they suffer pain that 's quite real . It can be quite severe . But actually there 's no need for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the female body is not sensitive at all , it 's poorly supplied with end organs of touch . In fact , the internal entodermal origin of the lining of the vagina makes it similar to parts of the digestive tract  --  sensation must be mainly psychological  --  I think  --  it must be mainly psychological and not physical , not natural ? " You must imagine everything . 7 False facts . The detour around the construction , the mud , the planks in the mud , Elena walking carefully on one of the planks , and one of the men yelling down at her . Cupping his hands to his mouth , yelling . Another man laughing . Another man , stocky in his workclothes , throwing something at her that had n't enough weight to carry itself to her  --  just a crumpled-up paper bag , a lunch bag . False facts : they did n't really want to hurt her . Did n't hate her . Did n't want her dead . False facts : the recitation of the weather around the country , the temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean something but it will not .  | False facts : blood on instruments , no proof of pain . Proof only of blood . False facts were like the entrance to one of the rooms of the house : you came to the doorway , looked inside , stepped quietly inside . And then ? You believed the room and its furniture had been prepared for you . It must mean something . In a film , on television , this would mean something ; it would be an entrance into something . It would not be simply an extension of the room you had come from . . . . But the room and its furniture were false facts because nothing was going to happen . Therefore the room is safe to enter . A false fact : teeth in a laboratory vial , shaken up , treated with chemicals and analyzed and rearranged . They mean nothing . The date , September i8 , 1970 : another false fact . At the head of a page that date would indicate something , something false . Better to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day out of many . Elena yawned , checking the date on the kitchen calendar . She yawned luxuriously . Her hair was loose , drying , and she let her head fall forward when she yawned so that her hair fell slowly forward , slowly onto the kitchen counter . What did it mean , September 18 , 1970 ? 8 " Both intelligence and patience , yes , an intelligent patience , n'est-ce pas ? ? but also the artistic sense , residing almost I think in the fingertips ? " A man in a dark suit and a white turtleneck shirt made of a thin crepy material , smiling . Wings of white hair were brushed back damply from his forehead ; the rest of his hair was very black . His bright dark eyes moved fondly around the room , lingering on one face and then another , and Elena waited tensely for him to seek her out , certainly he must seek her out , her , she had worked so hard . . . . Prince S. Stelp , standing with a wooden spoon raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly and thoughtfully inside his mouth as he caressed his students with his soft bright eyes , passing judgment almost against his will . Sauce bernaise . Elena stood primly and waited , waited for him to look at her . . . waited for him . . . hardly hearing his soothing words , his hesitant gracious accent , " to achieve the perfunctory in this case  | is itself a success . . . but one among you has surpassed even that , she is a genius this evening as so many evenings since our class has begun , I think you anticipate it is ? " 9 Elena washed her hair and dried it in a towel and let it lay loose , damp , heavy on her shoulders and past her shoulders . She wore a dancer 's practice costume , black synthetic fabric , sleeves to her wrists , bare legs . As she did her exercises she whipped her hair around her , front and back , forward , backward , until she lost count of how many times she had snapped her body erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the floor . Dizzy , staggering , she paused to stare at herself in the adjustable mirror : her blond hair like a mane about her face , tumbling past her face , her face flushed with good health , there is Elena Howe in the mirror , in the handsome silken bedroom . Her heart pounded but she began to move again , into the hard relentless whiplike rhythm of the exercises , flinging her wet hair forward , backward . 10 I am not requesting any financial reparation in the slightest , because I am of comfortable background , but only an acknowledgment from him of my existence . I live alone now , and things have happened in my life I will not mention because just to list them would be self-pitying , and I know how he hates self-pity in women or in anyone else . I do not know you , Mrs. Howe , but I challenge you to truly believe that your husband was ever as close to you in your intimate moments as he was with me , and I challenge you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie if confronted with the truth ! I ask you also to check back to 1969 and the end of 1968 and notice how often he made visits to Albany . If you will dare to ask . . . . Elena reread the letter . It was so familiar , the uphill charge of the handwriting , the small pinched angry letters in dark ink . . . . And the stationery was familiar : heavy dull green with buff edges . She was certain she had received a letter from this woman before , this Sylvia Murchinson from Albany , New York .  | Elena folded the letter back into its original folds  --  three crisp folds . And then she folded it again , carefully , creasing it with the edge of her hand . Then she folded it again , and once again , though it was now more difficult ; the stationery was thick . When it was as small as she could get it , Elena dropped it into the wicker wastebasket she brought to the table with her every morning when she went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal request from someone 's campaign manager asking if Marvin might like to align himself with this candidate , who was trying for the Republican nomination for mayor of Detroit . Elena folded this as well and dropped it into the wastebasket . Marvin stayed clear of politics . 11 Shopping on Kercheval one pleasant day , on the Hill , Elena happened to see her mother striding ahead of her  --  a woman in a tawny wool suit with puffs of fur at her neck and wrists , bright fox-colored fur . Her mother was walking quickly and Elena hesitated , not wanting to call out  --  there were women shoppers all around her , and it would have been strange for anyone to shout ; the other women would have stared at Elena in amazement . So she hurried after her mother , who seemed almost to be hurrying away from her . Ardis 's shoulders looked strong and confident ; her hair was fixed now in a French twist , so that her head appeared small , sleeker than Elena remembered . They passed a new art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antique shop with wrought-iron dogs and geraniums in kettles guarding the door , a gourmet and health-food store that displayed kits for making yoghurt at home , and , as Elena 's mother paused to look in the window of the Christian Science Reading Room , Elena breathlessly caught up with her . " Mother ? ? " Ardis turned to her , startled . Elena saw that her face had been slightly altered : she wore pale green eye shadow , her cheeks were carefully rouged , her lips quite red . . . the face designed by Fanny Price , of London , a young girl who had recently toured the United States to promote her " Raggedy Doll " line of clothes ... . " Or should I call you Marya ? " Elena asked .  | The woman smiled in recognition , happily . " Oh , you 're mistaking me for Marya Sharp , are n't you ? I take that as a compliment ! " Then , seeing Elena 's look of confusion , she smiled sympathetically . " It 's the strangest thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Marya , in Hudson 's downtown , and he just would n't believe I was someone else . He was quite angry about one of her programs . . . . But then nothing at all happened until just yesterday , and then again it was in Hudson 's , in the bridal registry , a woman this time  --  a saleswoman  --  and she thought I was just being modest , you know , pretending not to be Marya Sharp ? And now again this morning , what a coincidence ! But I 'm afraid I 'm not Marya , I 'm only Olivia Larkin . " Elena stared . She had not made sense of all those words . " Olivia Larkin ? " she said . " But ? Is that another name ? I do n't know what ? " " We know each other , dear , do n't we ? We 've met somewhere or other  --  at the club downtown , the DAC , was n't it ? ? you 're Marvin Howe 's wife ? Yes , I know we 've met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I want to thank you for the compliment ! She 's such an intelligent and stimulating woman , is n't she ? " " I wish you would n't ? I mean , I ? I wish ? " Elena stared at her mother 's smile , which had not slackened . She was frightened of that smile , which was much broader than any she could recall , and the bright spots of rouge were a mistake , a sign of bad judgment even if that face was now fashionable . It was n't like Ardis . And this woman was taller than Elena remembered , and her voice was shriller ... . Elena shook her head . Confused . Confusion . " I wish that ? I ? I ? " she paused . Then she regained her own voice and said evenly , " I wish I would n't make such mistakes  --  I sometimes make mistakes like that ? I ? " " Oh , we all do ! " the woman cried enthusiastically . " It 's so human , I do it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making such a flattering mistake ! " Elena smiled and gazed vaguely at the window of the Reading Room and listened to the woman chatter , wondering how she could escape , how she could get back home , safely back home . It seemed to her that a maze lay behind her and ahead of her and  | that it would demand her greatest concentration ; but she could not think at all . 12 Four couples invited . Ten persons altogether . Sat . 7:30 Jan. 30 1970 . Invitations sent out Jan. 1o .

Even the laughter was earnest . Elena felt so intoxicated with the evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone ; triumphant and chaste , Mrs. Howe , glowing out of the house 's lovely mirrors . A successful evening . People stayed late and talked loudly and earnestly . Elena felt feverish with success . Lovely smiles , faces , nudging of old friends  --  someone 's wife &; Marvin , a little drunk , merry and comradely , telling jokes . Jokes about ? ? Elena could n't quite hear . Then she lay sleepless and enchanted beside him as he slept , his head hot on the pillow , Elena 's face hot and dry , feverish , as the evening replayed itself in her head and replayed itself and 13 " Mentally Handicapped Children of Wayne County FundRaising Luncheon . " E. picked up at the house by friends , driven to Belle Isle , staring happily at the dull cold sharp March day , the  | usual leafless trees , the forlorn remnants of newspapers and lunch bags . Women talking : almost musical in their exclamations and laughter . A woman wearing black leather gloves was driving ; E. notices rings bulging sharply beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pulls off her glove to examine her hand : a chunk-sized diamond , a white-gold band encrusted with diamonds , cutting into her flesh .

" " No the monument is to the right " " You passed the monument " " I always get lost on Belle Isle " " Is that the Canadian shore there or did we drive all around the island in a circle and " " It 's dirty here " " There will never be another riot because " " There 's that other monument up ahead  --  that statue ?
