AN EYE FOR THE DRAGON : SOUTHEAST ASIA OBSERVED : 1954-1970 by Dennis Bloodworth. 414 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $8.95 . <P> AT WAR WITH ASIA by Noam Chomsky. 313 pages . Pantheon. $7.95 . <P> The British philosopher Isaiah Berlin once divided thinkers into Hedgehogs and Foxes . The Fox roams freely , a random chaser of unknown intellectual scents , a case of pure curiosity organized only by the zigzag of the hunt . The Hedgehog bounds his territory , reduces it to a unity . He starts with his own terms and squeezes the universe inside them . <P> Dennis Bloodworth ( The Chinese Looking Glass ) is a journalist , since 1954 a Far Eastern correspondent for the Observer-and a Fox . Noam Chomsky is a professor of linguistics at M.I.T. , a New Left ideologue ( American Power and the New Mandarins ) , a leading protester against the war in Viet Nam - and a Hedgehog . <P> Corruption of America . Bloodworth sees Southeast Asia as so complex , so varied and contradictory that he can hardly write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , separate into archipelagos and a thousand tiny islands . The dust jacket shows the head of a dragon : violent , mysterious , serpentine , finally inexplicable except as a myth . <P> Chomsky 's dust jacket presents a photograph of a beefy American G.I. leading a frail , blindfolded , near-naked Viet Cong out of a helicopter by a rope around the neck . For Chomsky , Indochina is a kind of parable . Viet Nam is the historical misadventure that has exposed the corruption of America-its materialism , its hypocritical democracy - to itself and to the world . If Americans can not see this and reform , he says , they will destroy themselves and quite possibly everybody else . <P> Alongside Chomsky 's apocalyptic posture-historian as moralist and trac-tarian-Bloodworth has the slouch of a cynic . He is the professional journalist , selecting the amusing or exotic tidbit for the reader 's jaded palate . He has seen too much to be shocked by anything or to believe in anything . He survives by his reflex for flippancy . Yet , by a curious paradox , Bloodworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chomsky 's . <P> Foreign Devils . Bloodworth can not resist comparing Indonesia 's Sukarno to " a slightly pass Hollywood corespondent on the beach at Cap d'Antibes . " Nor can he pass up the insignificant but tourist-thrilling fact . Example : anyone can buy a murder contract in the Philippines for as little as $250 , $25 down . ( Try a syndicate called the Beatles . ) <P> Despite his role as lively guide , Bloodworth , by a kind of Oriental indirection , gets his major points across . He makes it unmistakably clear that the one goal all Southeast Asian countries share is independence-merdeka in Malay , doc lap in Vietnamese . Big Brother is not wanted , whether he is American , Russian or Chinese . <P> Bloodworth makes it equally clear that even without its foreign devils , Southeast Asia would be no Garden of Eden ; its corruption is not an Occidental import brought in by missionaries and gunboats . The native pattern has found " browbeaten peasants " regularly caught between bandits and greedy oligarchies . Revolution , the " habit-forming " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Communism , " says Bloodworth , is just " the devil the poor do n't yet know . "
