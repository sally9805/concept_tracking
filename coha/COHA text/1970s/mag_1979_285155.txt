An epic in progress and brief , memorable histories <P> MIRABELL : BOOKS OF NUMBER by James Merrill Atheneum ; 182 pages ; $10.95 <P> The centerpiece of Divine Comedies ( 1976 ) , James Merrill 's last book of poetry , was a 90-page narrative that turned a parlor game into a trip through the first circles of the supernatural . The Book of Ephraim recounted how Merrill and his friend David Jackson used a Ouija board to contact Ephraim , a witty Greek Jew born in A.D. 8 ; it then followed the two-way conversations that ensued over the next 20 years . This device gave the added ballast of history to Merrill 's already established lyric and autobiographical skills ; Ephraim 's was the spirit of a number of ages , and he proved himself to be a talkative and entertaining tour guide . The imaginary collaboration yielded a poem of rare ambition and scope , a sinuous , sensuous meditation on death and timelessness . <P> Mirabell : Books of Number takes what began as a baroque saga and amplifies it to an epic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Ouija board . The place is their house in Stonington , Conn. , the time the summer of 1976 . Ephraim reappears , although vastly overshadowed by the band of dark creatures urgently seeking the poet 's attention . They are the fallen angels , now reduced to minding the machinery set in motion by God , whom they call Biology . As the enspirited cup moves among the capital letters on the Ouija board , their plea is spelled out : FIND US BETTER PHRASES FOR THESE HISTORIES WE POUR FORTH/ HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT MAN WILL LOVE HIS MIND &; LANGUAGE . Merrill modestly replies : " Today that 's a responsibility/ Not to be faced . " Then curiosity gets the better of him : " On with the history ! " <P> And what a history : primordial creation , the slow appearance of grassy Edens , the rise and fall of Atlantis and the centaurs , the fatal presumptuousness of Akhnaton and Queen Nefertiti , God Biology 's new orders for the progress of mankind : THERE SHALL BE NO ACCIDENT , THE SCRIBE SHALL/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO PARADISE . The dark powers are given the responsibility of setting up a research laboratory to clone worthy souls . Mirabell , the name Merrill gives his chief informant , explains : A MERE 2 MILLION CLONED SOULS LISTEN TO EACH OTHER WHILE/ OUTSIDE THEY HOWL &; PRANCE SO RECENTLY OUT OF THE TREES . What has alarmed Heaven and agitated Mirabell to speak is a recent cloud on the human horizon : A CONCERTED USE OF ATOMIC/ WEAPONRY NOW FALLING INTO HANDS OF ANIMALS SOULS . <P> Merrill is of course up to something more complex than chanting " No more nukes , " although that message is undeniably in the work . The cosmology he assembles is as elaborate and beautiful as any set to poetry since Yeats wrote of gyres and phases of the moon . It also dances with humor . The late W.H. Auden , now an onlooker in heaven , plays an owlish Vergil to Merrill 's Dante . " Did you realize , " Merrill asks , " that people have plutonium in their lymph glands ? " Auden taps back : SURELY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Merrill 's mastery of forms , so skillful as to pass by almost unnoticed . Humans speak in a supple , casually rhymed iambic pentameter . A hurricane strikes the East Coast :
