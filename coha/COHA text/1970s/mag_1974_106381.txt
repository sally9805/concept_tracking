Last week a correspondent covering the Asian Games in Iran for Tokyo 's The Mainichi received an urgent telephone call from his publisher , who demanded to know what was wrong with the powerful Japanese swimming team . " Not much , " replied Reporter Yasu-Aki Suda . " It 's the food , it 's the beds in the village and it 's the Chinese . Mostly , it 's the Chinese . " And so it went in Tehran , as Chairman Mao Tse-tung 's shy and smiling athletes kept extending their hands in friendship and , to their increasing embarrassment , repeatedly ended up with fistfuls of medals . // No Chinese amassed a greater embarrassment of riches than woman gymnast Chiang Shao-yi , who won five medals , all of them gold . // " Congratulations , " said an American photographer to Chiang 's coach , Hsu Jen-chieh . " Now would it be all right if I take a picture of her with all of her medals ? " // Hsu beamed approval . " Certainly you can  --  on the victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " No , I mean with all of her medals , " said the photographer . // The Chinese coach recoiled . " All of her medals . No , no , no . Not like Spitz . Not like Mark Spitz . With one medal only . " // By the end of the sixth day of the Games the Chinese were finding it increasingly difficult to avoid comparison to big winners such as Spitz . The People 's Republic of China had won 57 medals , including 16 golds , and it seemed likely that with eight more days of competition and some of China 's best events still to come , the harvest had barely begun . Only the Japanese , who have dominated the Asian Games since they began in 1951 , had won more medals ( 97 ) , but Japan had been wiped out in two of its strongest suits : diving and gymnastics . And it had seen the Chinese make inroads in a third , swimming . // The success of the Chinese was stunning for a nation self-exiled from international competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the rest of the world could play its games with Taiwan and turned the motherland into a vast , private training ground for the 300 million athletes among China 's 800 million citizens . Four years later he made it official and withdrew the People 's Republic from all international athletic federations . Except for a few exhibition tours after Mao introduced Ping-Pong diplomacy in 1972 , the Chinese have competed exclusively among themselves for the past 20 years . // Four years ago when the Iranians were awarded the Asian Games for 1974 , they made it clear that they wanted the People 's Republic , not Taiwan , to represent China . By an overwhelming margin , the Asian Games Federation agreed , threw out the Taiwanese and invited the mainlanders to replace them . The International Olympic Committee , which has a long history of supporting Chiang Kai-shek at the expense of all the Chinese athletes who do not live on his island , threatened to withdraw its sanction for the Asian Games . Numerous federations said they would boycott the Games and the generalissimo sulked. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with IOC members , who finally agreed to approve the Games if the federations of the various sports would go along with the new China policy . After more negotiations , the federations slowly began unloading Taiwan to make room for the People 's Republic . FINA , the federation that controls swimming , diving and water polo , proved the toughest group to crack . The mainland Chinese applied for membership , but stipulated that if Taiwan was not ousted from FINA , the federation could forget their application . By a two-vote margin , the 30 members of FINA 's executive committee voted to forget it . Following 11th-hour negotiations with FINA President Dr. Harold Henning of the United States , the Chinese dropped the offending clause from their application , and the day before the Asian Games opened approval was granted for them to participate in the water-sports events as nonmembers. // In a small room in the apartment complex assigned to the Chinese in the athletes ' village later that same day , Wu Chung-yuan , the man in charge of international relations at the Games for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that FINA had given its blessing , and that nothing had happened to make anyone think that Taiwan was anything more than just an island province off the coast of China . " The Chinese stand on this problem is very clear and well known , " said Wu . " There is only one China . That is the People 's Republic of China . If anyone schemes to make two Chinas , or one China and one Taiwan , it would be absolutely opposed by our side . Taiwan is in no way a separate entity ; it is one of the provinces of China . " // The subject then changed from politics to sports and Wu managed to simultaneously smile and look sad when asked about the strength of his country 's team . " Not too good , I am afraid , " he said . " As you know , this is our first time in the Asian Games , so our knowledge of the standards of the other teams is limited . Many Asian countries have advanced players . Ours are not so advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were told that during these competitions we should remember the slogan : friendship first , competition second . In some events , perhaps badminton and table tennis , our teams may be compared with others . " // That the Chinese were worthy of comparison to any of their rivals became evident almost immediately after the magnificent ceremony opening the Games . Su Chih-po , a 26-year-old worker in a harvesting-machine factory in Hopeh province , scored 552 points in the 50-meter free pistol event and took the Games ' first gold medal . A short time later Su joined Chi Ke-fa and two other teammates in the 50-meter free pistol event and , bang , China had its second gold . // Thirty-seven-year-old Chi is China 's national champion , and he felt that he had been done in by the combination of Tehran 's hot , dry climate and 5,600-foot altitude . In practice back home in Kansu province he had shot a 573 , one point better than the world record . At the Games he could do no better than a 533. // A small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gargled and grinned . " I blame the conditions , " he said , " but maybe it is my age that is catching up with me . Of course , gold medals are not important . We are happy to win them , but the results were not the reason for coming here . " // It was a theme that would be heard many times in the days that followed , an idea tucked neatly into every interview , as though the Chinese were afraid everyone would forget that their true desire was Yu-i Di-i , Bi-sai , Ti-erh : friendship first , competition second . // " Winning lasts but briefly , " said Shih Tien-shu , the team 's interpreter . " In China we have a saying : winning or losing is not the important thing . It is the friendship . You can see the results on the scoreboard or hear them on the radio , and then they are gone . But friendship strikes roots in the hearts of people . In China , sports is a very good bridge for people to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people want to make money out of sports . This is not sportsmanship . It is not sport . " // The other Asian competitors must have wished for even more Yu-i and less Bi-sai from the Chinese . Going into the second week of the Games the Chinese men 's basketball team was unbeaten , the water polo team was dunking opponents by scores of 10-3 and 17-2 , the men 's tennis team had lost just one match en route to qualifying for the finals and even the weight lifters , who were given no chance , had gotten a medal or two . // " Actually , we are not very good , " said Shen Tsien-chiu , the men 's tennis coach . He is a short , stocky man from Shanghai , which is where the best Chinese players come from . In the 1950s Shen played twice at Wimbledon . " Each time I lost in the second round , " he said . // " To whom ? " // " I ca n't remember , " Shen replied with a faint frown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that Australian player . The lefthander . What 's his name ? Laver ? Rod Laver ? Is that it ? I ca n't remember the other one . I just remember I did n't win . " // Play began on a court behind him and Shen turned to watch as his No. 2 man , Wang Fu-chang , edged Thailand 's Somparn Champisri 7-5 , 6-4 in a 3-0 Chinese sweep of the Thais . " We are just now getting used to the altitude here , " Shen said . " The ball moves faster than we expect and it is harder to control . We have a long way to go . Our style is not very active . We beat the Iranians yesterday , but even so , I think their style is much better , much more active . And I am very sorry to say we are playing without national champion Hsu Mei-lin . He is at the village , but he has a very heavy cold . I am not only sorry for me , but for the whole team . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to learn , to make ourselves healthy and to .... " // With Hsu sick , No. 3 man Lu Cheng-yi went undefeated in the first three matches and found himself the ace of the Chinese team . He is tall and slender and just turned 18 . A tennis player for six years , he works in a Shanghai textile mill and says he feels lucky if he gets to practice three or four times a week . Still , his play in the early rounds made him a strong favorite to win the men 's singles , but he frowned when he considered what a gold medal would mean to him . Finally he said : " If I achieve that , it would be a great honor for China . Still I would stay a common man . I do n't think it would make any difference in my life . I 'll be the same ordinary person . " // Chang Jung-hua is China 's national women 's tennis champion . Twenty-seven and married with no children , she works in a knitting mill . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold medal did not dismay her at all . // " Just being here is a great event for me , " she said . " I think I should try to do my best , but to win a medal is not my purpose . Of course , if I take one , it will be a great honor for me because it will mean I have developed my technique to its fullest . Billie Jean King ? Is she the one with the glasses ? Yes , I saw a picture of her once in a magazine . We had a film of her and some other players at Wimbledon . I did n't get to see it . It is a pity . " // Meanwhile the Japanese were thinking it was a pity that they had left their eight top gymnasts at home to prepare for the world championship next month at Varna , Bulgaria . Led by 27-year-old Chiang Shao-yi , the Chinese women won nine gymnastics medals , including five gold , and they had onlookers wondering what they will do for an encore after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly as strong but they took nine medals as well , not bad for a bunch of beginners . // " We have worked very hard for a year , " Chiang said . She has been a gymnast since she was an 11-year-old primary school student in Yunnan province . Now she is an instructor in her sport at the Physical Culture and Sports Institute in Peking . Gymnastics have always been popular in China , she explained , especially among students , but it has been only during the last 20 years that artistic gymnastics have been widely practiced. // " The main thing is to improve or raise the standard through friendly exchanges , " she said . " For instance , we visited the United States last year and we learned a lot from the American players . " Quite a lot , it appears . On Tuesday the Chinese men and women won the team titles . The next day Chiang and teammates Ning Hsiao-lin and Hsin Kuei-chiu finished 1-2-3 in the all-round , and two nights later Chiang was brilliant as she won three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( out of 20 ) for her two performances on the floor . The same evening Tsai Huan-tsung won four medals for the men to boost the Chinese gymnasts ' total to 18. // Arthur Gander is the president of FIG , the F ? d ? ration Internationale de Gymnastique . He is a German Swiss who wears baggy pants and has a tendency to pound the table when he speaks . He was once a member of the Swiss national gymnastic team and had been a gym teacher until his retirement . And he was aghast at the expulsion of Taiwan from the Asian Games , but the Chinese gymnasts won him over with their performances . // " There is no event in which they are lagging , " Gander said . " They are equally good in all . They have wonderful moves and technique , and a virtuosity and precision that is a rarity even among Japanese men . The trend in gymnastics is toward acrobatics , as demonstrated by Olga Korbut . I 'm not a fan of it , but it seems everyone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quadruple twists . The art of gymnastics is suffering . The Chinese show more artistic performances . They are total perfection . To watch them makes your heart laugh . " // He found a table nearby and began to pound on it . " I did not expect them to be this good , but they convinced me . A Chinese is a very well-formed human being , better formed than a Japanese , for instance . " He pounded some more . " Or a Swiss . That is one advantage . The Chinese men are most beautiful , and the women are better formed than most women from other countries as well . " // Because they do not belong to FIG , the Chinese were performing at a disadvantage . As outsiders , they were not able to place a judge on the panel . " There was another thing regarding the rules , " said Gander . " Every other team practiced in the big hall where the competitions took , place although it was against the rules . Nobody said anything . The Chinese were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice hall . They like to keep in the background . " // In swimming the Japanese were still the dominating force , even though the Chinese won 18 medals , including eight in diving . With those victories , China served notice that it is likely to be a formidable foe in the future . A friendly foe , that is. // The women 's diving star  --  insofar as the Chinese will permit anyone to be a star  --  was Chung Shao-chen , a compact 26-year-old from Kwangtung province , a warm and watery place from which most of the good Chinese swimmers and divers come . She finished just ahead of teammate Sung Yun-tsang to capture a gold medal in the three-meter springboard . Two days later she turned in a stunning , gold-medal-winning performance off the platform . // The men did almost as well in the three-meter springboard , with first place going to Hsieh Tsai-min , a 21-year-old student from Szechwan province who looks like Peter Lorre , and the bronze medal to 16-year-old Liu Sui. // Chinese Diving Coach Liang Po-hsi was all smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work well and he agreed to an interview with a woman writer from the New China News Agency , who acted as an interpreter for a Western colleague . The English-speaking reporter asked Liang if he had expected to win that many medals . // " Of course . We came here to win medals . " the Chinese writer abruptly answered . " Why are you asking such a question ? " // " Oh , I do n't know . Why do n't you ask him anyway ? " // Liang was asked and he did not say that the divers came to Iran to win medals . " For us friendship comes first , competition second , " he said . " Whether we get the medals or not , we are very happy we have made many new friends and have met many old friends . We think our men and women have displayed good sportsmanship and also a high level of skill . But we are especially happy that our Iranian friends are very friendly to us and we have practiced together with other Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our main harvest . And our aim in developing this event in our country is to build up the health of the people . " // Dr. Henning , the FINA president , was asked how well the Chinese swim . // " Up to now , we did n't know , " he said . " They have done very well . Certainly not world class by any means , but they have qualified for the finals in every event and in most of them even had two people in the finals . Their strokes are very basic and orthodox . I think they have a good understanding of the strokes , which in time , as they watch other swimmers and learn new techniques , they will carry over into their training and they will improve on their times . Their starts and turns are terrible . Even the diving is n't world class , although they certainly are better than most divers in Asia . They are picking some difficult dives , but the execution is n't what you would expect in world class . They need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swimmers from other countries . " // Well , that seems to be what the Chinese had been saying all along . Now that the Asian Games have moved into their second week , into sports the Chinese have already learned well , such as table tennis and badminton , more of those powerful arms will be extended in friendship . It is enough to make their friends shudder .
