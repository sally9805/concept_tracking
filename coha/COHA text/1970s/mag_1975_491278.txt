One sunny afternoon , some time back , in the palace of the King of Jordan , His Majesty was having tea with some of his former army officers . The atmosphere was strained . Hussein 's attitude toward his guests stemmed from his heart , and he was genuinely friendly . His guests , however , hid wracking fears behind a forced mask of smiles . They did not know whether they had been summoned into his presence to be pardoned or executed . Hussein , their Commander-in-Chief , had just released them from prison , where they had been serving the first months of stiff sentences for an assassination attempt on his life . His Majesty 's Chief of Security had argued that any inclination on the part of the King to free them would show weakness on his part , rather than humaneness . But Hussein insisted on freeing them , saying that no useful purpose was ever served by imprisoning one 's enemies . " Freedom , " he remarked , " could turn these men into devout and loyal subjects . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent them back home to the bosom of their families with new hope and new jobs . To be compassionate is the creed of King Hussein  --  strangely , in a sense , because he lives with danger every day of his life . In spite of repeated assassination attempts in the past and the constant threat of ambush by invisible enemies , he remains uncowed . As the Ruler of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan , his job is filled with joy and sorrow in unequal proportion , yet he tackles it with enthusiasm , not allowing political furors to stop him . The more obstacles arise , the keener he becomes , considering it a challenge to assist his subjects in all crises . Hussein 's determination and efforts to rebuild and initiate projects to fill the voids left by 1967 war losses have never faltered . It is his courage and willpower which have kept the Jordanians together . Like Sadat , he is more cosmopolitan than most Arab leaders , and , as is well known , he is a good friend of America . Hussein is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other Arab States must live with the Israeli reality . For the time being this is a fact of life , and Hussein believes that if the desert is to bloom again , peace and not war must rule in the Near East . There is a new look to King Hussein . It is the look of a man with a large family he loves , embracing not only his own children but a feeling for all his countrymen . On the twentieth anniversary of his reign , he addressed them at a giant rally : " Citizens , brave officers , soldiers and Arabs . Greetings from the one who loves you , who believes in you , who has dedicated his life forever to serve your objectives and your great hopes . Today you are celebrating a day that is yours and your nation 's in its great homeland .. .. " You are also honoring me today by celebrating the twentieth anniversary of my assuming responsibility and carrying the sacred banner . It is an honor which I receive with endless thanks and gratitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am looking at the general picture and I do not see myself as the sole one on this occasion , but I see you standing with me in the picture . I see you all since the moment I carried the trust from my early youth . I , who have grown up amongst you . I bore more worries than any young man of my age did . But my faith in God , my country and nation have been my great asset and support ... " All of you who stand by my side in this pure and steadfast land , you citizens ! and you , my armed forces ! you free my eyes and are the // unremitting source of my strength . " Hussein can communicate . Even I was stirred on that day and proud that I knew him . The first time we met , protocol was brushed aside . I had been living in Pakistan and went for a vacation to the Middle East in 1961 . During my brief stay I was invited to a press party for British and American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host , the Minister of Information for Jordan , wondered why I had not left with the others for the airport and the return trip to the West . I laughed and told him I did not belong to their group , but lived in Karachi and now was on holiday . lie was so surprised I was happy dwelling in a Muslim land that he said : " You ought to meet my King , His Majesty Hussein . He would enjoy meeting an American lady living and working in Pakistan . " Since I was booked to depart the next morning , I told him there was no time . " How can 1 meet a King on such short notice ? " He smiled . " Come home with me , " he said , " meet my wife . and stay overnight with us in Amman and in the morning you will have an audience with His Majesty . " Though I hardly believed it would happen , it all came true . Then , as on more recent occasions , nobody could have been more gracious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was I happy ? Did 1 like it so much in Pakistan ? and so much more . do recall asking him ( this was a few months after his marriage to English Toni Gardner , now Princess Muna ) if his unborn child would be a boy  --  would he be the Crown Prince ? Without hesitation , His Majesty replied , " hzshallah " ( yes ) . The King and I discussed many things . We spoke about the refugee problem in his land and the efforts of his government to aid them and how much I admired what had been accomplished . Hussein seemed to bear no malice to Israel , and I felt here is a monarch who at least attempts a broad perspective . Before leaving , I presented His Majesty with a copy of a book I had written on Pakistan , promising that one day I would return and write one on Jordan . Since then , there have been many invitations and many returns and I met lovely Princess Muna , his second wife and mother of four children born prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Abdullah , now age twelve , is the eldest . He became the Crown Prince but not for long , When war was imminent the King sacrificed the fulfillment of his desire by changing his small son 's status and making his younger brother I lassan the Crown Prince for the safety of the country , should anything happen to Hussein . The second son , Prince Feisal , is eleven years of age while the pretty and fascinating twin princesses Zein and Aisha first saw the light of day in 1968 . Alia , his teenage daughter by his first wife , lived with them . Hussein is an adoring father and spends a great deal of time with his youngsters on picnics and trips into the desert , delightful family affairs . On the harsher side , the army is Hussein 's passion . His whole life is entwined with it . He shows off his guns to visiting Arab dignitaries and pilots them around in his helicopter . Jordan reputedly was created by Winston Churchill over cognac and cigars in order to soothe Abdullah , Hussein 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Britain withdrew in 1948 and Palestine became Israel , the Arabs and the Jews who had been friends and neighbors suddenly found themselves on opposing sides . Abdullah wasted no time in seizing the West Bank and proclaimed himself king of the many thousands of refugees who escaped to it . The concern of Hussein over these Palestinian refugees allowed a rival and fanatically warlike guerrilla movement to spread in the refugee camps . In spite of his efforts to appease them , they shook his throne and practically kidnapped Amman while he was trapped inside . Hussein almost lost his life to these enemies before he called in his army , took control and rid Jordan of the guerrillas . During this period his family fled to England but toward the end , his wife Muna returned and found him worn out and ill . Once peace was restored , King Hussein bounced back and his initiative came to the fore . He directed the rebuilding of structures , the clearing of rubble , and the reuniting of his people . Risks never have stopped Hussein . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , he noticed a street demonstration . Although the authorities had been called to quell the disturbance , Hussein drove into the midst of it as it rose to riot proportions . He alighted from his jeep , smiled and conversed with the disputants . Within a few minutes he not only had them shaking hands with him but with each other . Hussein , lineal descendant of the Prophet Muhammad , possesses a faith in the Arab future . Jordan is a small but proud land With many deserts , purity of air , star-filled skies and most of all ... friendly people  --  who take kindly to strangers . The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is bounded on the north by Syria , on the east by Iraq , on the southeast and south by Saudi Arabia , and on the west by Israel and by the Israeli-occupied West Bank region , part of Jordan until 1967 . Jordan proper , which lies east of the Jordan River , has an area of 35,000 square miles , while the West Bank area has about 2,640 square miles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Indiana , or of Scotland and Wales combined . Jordan 's short twelve miles of coastline lies in the southwest on the Gulf of Aqaba , an arm of the Red Sea . The city of Aqaba , the only port , plays a large part in the economic life of the country . Jordan has four major geographical regions  --  the East Bank Uplands , the West Bank Uplands , the Jordan Desert and the Jordan Rift Valley . The desert , located in the territory of the East Bank , taking up about four-fifths of its space , is part of the Syrian Desert . Its northern part is composed of volcanic lava and basalt , and its southern part of sandstone and granite , partly eroded by wind . The East Bank Uplands overlook the Rift Valley and have an altitude of between 2,000 and 3,000 feet increasing in elevation to about 5,750 feet in the south . Outcrops of chalk , sand , limestone and flint extend to the extreme south , where igneous rocks predominate . Many valleys and streams circulate east , west and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a low region known as the Jafr Depression . The Jordan Valley , almost 1,300 feet below sea level at the Dead Sea , is the lowest point on // the surface of the earth . As it travels south , the Jordan River drains the waters of the Sea of Galilee , the Yarmuk River and the valley streams of both plateaus , into the Dead Sea . Actually a lake , the Dead Sea is forty-five miles long by ten miles wide  --  its waters are far saltier than the ocean . The West Bank Uplands , known for centuries as the Samarian and Judean Mountains , have an average height of 3,000 feet above sea level . Several large valleys cut into them and drain west toward the Mediterranean ; the valleys draining east are shorter , many consisting of deep gorges with soils both thin and poor , though occasional rich alluvial deposits are found among the hills . The Jordan River is revered by Christians , Jews and Moslems alike , and it is in its waters that Christ was baptized by St. John the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since 1948 has marked part of the frontier between Israel to the west and Jordan to the east , from a few miles south of the Sea of Galilee to the point where the Yabis River flows into it . Since 1967 , however , when Israeli forces occupied Jordanian territory on the West Bank , the Jordan River has served as the cease-fire line as far as the Dead Sea . While 223 miles in length , its course meanders , and the beeline distance between its origin and the Dead Sea is roughly 124 miles . A little-known attraction of Jordan is the desert castles set amid trees in the eastern part of the land , most of them used by the Ommayyad Caliphs around the eighth century A.D. Their main residence was in Damascus , but the Caliphs enjoyed life in the desert and would move with their entire entourage back to the land of their original Bedouin ancestry , to regain the pleasures of the simplicity and spaciousness of desert life . The castles were created to house the Caliphs and their families and followers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief indoor amusements and vast pools , elaborately decorated with heating pipes , can still be seen , where the family spent hours relaxing between feasts and sports . In the castle known as Kharana , sixty-two miles east of Amman , in the oasis of Azraq , are huge and mysterious basalt blocks and a mosque dating from the thirteenth century . Azraq now lies in the heart of a great National Park and reserve . Its enchanting oasis pools have yielded evidence of Paleolithic settlements , 200,000 years old . Castle Amra , built in the early eighth century , twenty miles from Azraq , is considered the best preserved . Hunting scenes , figures of Victory , Philosophy , Poetry , even saluki dogs and Islam 's enemies are shown in numerous frescoes on the castle 's walls . Castle Mushatta , the nearest one to Amman , though covered with fine carvings andmuch delicate detail , was never completed . However , the gigantic remains reflect how ornate the Ommayyads ' taste could be . Castle Hallabat , originally built in the reign of the Roman Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert chiefs , is still well preserved . Jordan is a country of youth- more than half of the people are under age nineteen . Most of the 2,350,000 people of Jordan are Arabs , speaking Arabic . In addition to the classic Arabic written language , there are various dialects differentiated by local accents and inflections . About 12 percent of the people are Christians , and the rest are Moslems . Besides the Arabs , there are small numbers of Circassians , Turkomans , Armenians , Kurds , White Russians and approximately 220 Samaritans , remnants of an ancient Jewish sect from Biblical times , who live in Nablus , on the West Bank . At least 200 Druzes live in and around Amman . The BahaiPersians  --  about 200 of them  --  live in the Jordan Valley . The Circassians are a Sunni Moslem group numbering about 1,000 , descendants of an immigrant group from the Caucasus . The Turkomans , a non-Arab community , inhabit the village of Rammun near Jerash . Hussein envisions a Jordan with calm in the streets ; a quickened business life for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks , mingling with brethren whose pushcarts // . are laden with scholastic books trundled through the roads of Amman , against the background of the City 's seven hills . The deluxe hotels , fine restaurants and the new trend of countless boutiques portray the irresistible look of the land and the feeling that a leader now speaks for the Hashemite Kingdom with his " I must win " vitality and faith in the future . This faith in the future led the King to create Hussein Youth City , hoping with characteristic optimism eventually to attract the Olympic Games to Amman . His Majesty envisioned this gigantic center , with 94.3 acres of government-donated land , as a complete world of sports when he proposed this project as a meeting place for youth of all ages . Today , Hussein Youth Center activities range from concerts , exhibitions and lectures to all types of sports spectacles . The swimming pools match Olympic standards , carpets of lush grass line the football fields , and surrounding this complex are 30,000 trees . Youth City was completed in 1972 after eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king is such that in every place of business , several pictures of Hussein hang upon the walls . Jordanians live simply , showing their emotion by saying what they think . They are proud of Hussein . Watching the King drive through the streets in any village or city always excites his subjects , and they inevitably hail him with cheers . In contrast , Hussein has not only escaped death many times but also witnessed the murder of his grandfather when he was a youth of sixteen as they entered a mosque in Jerusalem . Hussein 's memory of that violence taught him the Arab view of mortality  --  if you are to die , it is God 's will . As a result , Hussein has found the way to live each day to the utmost . He flies his own plane , swims , drives racing cars and is a ham radio operator . Above all he loves his land , especially its archaeological wonders . In Jerash he walks back into time . In Madaba he studies the maps of long ago . In the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce , an antiquity bursting into twentieth-century life . In the rose-red city of Petra , the Nabatean Citadel carved in the mountains , the precious jewel of Jordanian tourism , Hussein shared a tragedy . A sudden cloudburst threatened a large party of French tourists en route to Petra . They were warned that it was dangerous to travel , but they refused to listen . Caught in the onslaught of nature , they were swept to death in the torrent . Only two women managed to escape by climbing the walls of a gorge . Hussein was so appalled at this disaster that he flew there personally and brought the two half-drowned survivors to his palace for recuperation . Hussein was married for a third time in December of 1972 , an exercise of the prerogative of the Muslim male , which is traditional in his country . His bride was an attractive twenty-five-yearold hirdanian , who was born in Cairo while her father , His Excellency Sayid Balla Eddin Toukan , now a Royal Court Minister , was serving as Jordanian Ambassador . His daughter , now Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her piquant ways and natural charm have captured the hearts of Jordanians . The Queen is no stranger to America , having studied at Hunter College in New York . Hussein added a fourth daughter to his family when Alia gave birth to Princess Haya on May 3 , 1974 . The King travels a great deal . He is always being invited to visit other Arab lands , Europe and America . Recently , he opened the West Coast Air Show . Then to the joy of his family he went on a private visit to the Shah of Iran with his sons , daughter Alia and his Queen . Hussein 's overweaning problem , of course , is Palestine . He offers as his solution and hope of recovering the West Bank the means for its population to express freely their right of self-determination , via a referendum protected by international control . Hussein is looking ahead , thinking of the unborn generations who will live in the land . In a time when few kings care about their people , their welfare is his major concern .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
