CONCLUDING a speech on economic policy at a VIP-stacked Manhattan dinner three years ago , George Shultz startled the audience by abruptly breaking into song . To the lively tune of Silver Dollar , the then director of the Office of Management and Budget belted forth in full voice : <P> <P> A fact without a theory <P> Is like a ship without a sail , <P> Is like a boat without a rudder , <P> Is like a kite without a tail . <P> A fact without a figure <P> Is a tragic final act , <P> But one thing worse <P> In this universe <P> Is a theory without a fact . <P> <P> Shultz is seldom short on either fact or theory , although the softspoken , smooth-faced economist seldom expresses his ideas in song . His quick grasp of facts and theories , his skill in persuading the federal bureaucracy to act on them-plus an ironclad loyalty to the President-are the qualities that have prompted Richard Nixon to keep investing his Treasury Secretary with added clout . By now Shultz has become one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Working a twelve-hour day from a West Wing White House office as well as in his quarters in the Treasury , Shultz has taken over as trusted second in command ( after Nixon ) in an enormous range of Government functions , some of them only indirectly economic . Increasingly , when Nixon is called upon to make a final decision on policies affecting agriculture , labor , transportation or industry in general , he is listening to-sometimes leaning forward to hear-the quiet , unruffled voice of Shultz setting forth the choices . " He 's Mr. Clean , " says a longtime associate . " When the President asks him a question , George gives an answer on an honest and open philosophical base . " <P> His most compelling job last week clearly was to handle the devaluation . Another stunning example of just how far Shultz 's answers can lead the Administration was the President 's new farm program . Largely on the recommendation of his economic chief , Nixon proposed that Congress gradually abolish the federal subsidy program , which the nation 's farmers have relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , page 22 ) . Shultz has long argued that the old farm policy , which has cost federal taxpayers many billions over the past 40 years , is drastically outdated and keeps food prices higher than they would be in a free market . <P> At times , Shultz has given some bad advice . As the first director of the Office of Management and Budget , he held to a steady-as-she-goes insistence that the economy in 1971 would turn up strongly without more Government stimulation . He made a celebrated prediction that the gross national product in 1971 would reach $1,065 billion ; it turned out to be some $15 billion less , a huge error . " The most dramatic mistake I was involved in , " he admits , " was in judging that the economy in 1971 would expand more rapidly than it did . "
