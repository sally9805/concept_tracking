THE VISIT <P> by FRIEDRICH DUERRENMATT <P> Like Bertolt Brecht and Max Frisch , Switzerland 's Friedrich Duerrenmatt is one of those didactic dramatists who regard the theater as a classroom , the stage as a blackboard , the pen as a pointer and the playgoers as barely educable dolts . These playwrights take a dim view of man , dividing the species into two arbitrary categories : predators and prey , the fleecers and the fleeced . No one would deny that such characters are abundantly present in life , but to see the entire pattern of human behavior in these terms is one-eyed vision . As propounded in The Visit , currently being revived by the New Phoenix Repertory Theater , the lesson of the one-eyed is : Everything can be bought . <P> This old and unreliable clich remains in vogue precisely because it is a comfort to the cynically inert conscience . Why risk a moral stance if evil , greed and calculated self-interest will invariably win out ? Win they certainly do in The Visit . Clara Zachanassian ( Rachel Roberts ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her impoverished home town of Gullen with a rather special proposition . She will bestow half a billion marks on the town and another half a billion to be divided equally among its citizens in return for what might be called Salome 's revenge . <P> Seduced , impregnated and run out of town at 17 , she has come back for what she calls justice : nothing less than the life of her then youthful betrayer Anton Schill ( John Me Martin ) , now an amiable , bumbling shopkeeper and a town favorite . Responding in outrage , the townspeople treat Clara 's offer as a macabre joke . However , they promptly proceed to plunge into debt on the supposition that Clara will bail them out without the sacrificial killing . Finally faced with the alternatives of penury or plenty , the citizens stage a trial in which Schill is condemned to death as a kind of enemy of the people . <P> The play is tricked out with melodramatic devices that keep it moving suspensefully , though often with a heavily ironic tread . Always fastidiously attentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stylized Expressionism , which helps mask gaping implausibilities in the writing . <P> While the two leads can scarcely dispel the powerful memory of the 1958 Lunt-Fontanne production , they establish their own interpretations with unstrained validity . Rachel Roberts brings a commandingly icy meanness to Clara while hinting at a lost tenderness . In recent seasons , John McMartin has established himself as an actor of distinctive range . He has played the disenchanted author in Follies , the skeptical servant Sganarelle in Moliere 's Don Juan , and the mask-divided soul Dion Anthony in O'Neill 's The Great God Brown . Now , as the hero of The Visit , he is initially bland , wistfully nostalgic about his early romance , then terrified and finally stoically resigned . Paradoxically , his work , as well as that of the rest of the cast , refutes the play 's central theme . Money alone could never buy it .
