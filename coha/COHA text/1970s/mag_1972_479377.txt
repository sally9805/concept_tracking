Iremember clearly the night in early May 1954 when I placed a call to Robert Capa in Tokyo from my home in Armonk , New York . Life magazine had asked him to pinch-hit for Howard Sochurek covering the war in Indochina . As his editor-agent at Magnum Photos , it was up to me to make the deal . I had deep misgivings , recalling his many close calls of World War II , some of which we had shared . " Do n't think you have to go , " I practically shouted across the Pacific . " It 's not our war . ' But off he went . A fortnight later , while photographing a French army convoy making its way through the rice paddies southwest of Hanoi , he stepped on a land mine . He had called his last , self-assigned picture story , " Bitter Rice . " Robert Capa 's death inspired obituary photo-essays in the world 's picture magazines , his final pictures framed in the sprocket-holed margins of the film . We buried him in the old Quaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot , nor would Caps care , John Morris , who was London picture editor for Life during World War 11 , is now picture editor for the New York Times . but when his huge French army coffin was placed in that hillside , it marked the unrecognized rebirth of one of the noblest , strangesi ? aud perhaps most was t crusades in the history of journalism : to end war by showing its true and terrible image . The crusade had begun in World War II with Edward Steichen , whose duty as a reconnaissance photographer in World War I had ended with revulsilm ? " How could men and nations have been so stupid ? " After Pearl Harbor he became convinced that " if a real image of war could be photographed and presented to the world , it might make a contribution toward ending the specter of war . " Age sixty-seven , he volunteered for the U.S. Navy , formed the " Steichen group " of photographers , and finally took charge of all Navy combat photography . It may seem an odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Man , " but Steichen has never acknowledged any contradiction . But World War II was a war in which one could somehow believe . They were the bad guys and we were the good guys , and there was no sensation quite like that of riding the first jeep into a freshly liberated village and being showered with kisses , roses , and wine . The only guilt one felt , as a noncombatant photographer or reporter , was that others were doing your fighting for you . Or as Gerda Taro , the German photographer who was Capa 's first love , said in Spain ; " You get an absurd feeling that somehow it 's unfair still to be alive . " ( Two days later she was dead , crushed by a tank . ) World War II was the still photographer 's war . There were the twice-weekly newsreels , but the image of war that came into the home was carried by newspapers and magazines . It was the decade before television . News photographers captured the public 's imagination . Only the syndicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murrow , and perhaps the guys from Yank and Stars &; Stripes ( like Bill Mauldin I equaled them in prestige . 72 Dom infs . They soon found themselves shooting a twofold tragedy : the story of American servicemen fighting a war they did not comprehend , and a people torn asunder , brother against brother . Duncan maintains that Korea was a " good " war in that we were fighting side by side with Koreans in their defense against aggression . He recalls his picture of a wounded American being carried to safety by a Korean peasant . Carl Mydans likewise tells stories of blood brotherhood tinder fire between Korean and GI . But the one-sided censorship of World War II broke down in Korea . European photographers tended not to see the war so ideologically . Magnum 's great Swiss photographer , Werner Bischof , saw it as stark human tragedy . A team from England 's Picture Post showed the brutality of South Korean troops so shockingly that Picture Post 's editor , Tom Hopkinson , was forced to resign ( the British Establishment sided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's summary statement in a Life essay on a divided Korean family that became one of the classics of photojournalism , Duncan , asking Life 's editors to throw away the captions and let the pictures tell it , joined his Marine buddies in the frigid retreat from the 1950 Chinese offensive and pronounced , in " Christmas in Korea , " a pictorial epitaph on the war . Going on to Vietnam in 1953 , Duncan was shocked to find an old-fashioned colonial war in progress ? Foreign Legion , buglers , and all . " It was now nearly over . The cause was bankrupt from the start . " His report in Life upset the State Department of John Foster Dulles , and Duncan was later personally chewed out by his big boss , Henry R. Luce . Whether or not Duncan 's expose had any influence on Washington 's decision not to rescue the French from disaster the following spring is not known . But his pictures , and those of Howard Sochurek , clearly revealed the moral hankruptcy of the French regime . Neither Duncan nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1954 . Robert Capa was not there either ; he arrived in Hanoi a few days later . As I came into my house the night of May 25 , 1954 , the phone was ringing . The day had begun with dreadful news . I had been awakened in a little hotel where I was attending the University of Missouri 's photographic workshop , to hear that Werner Bischof had been found dead on assignment in Peru . His station wagon ha . gone over a cliff . His wife , back in Zurich , was expecting a child at any moment . It was too much , and we decided to try to suppress the news until she was safely delivered . I hurried back to New York by plane and then home . The voice on the phone was that of a Life researcher , and she sounded distraught . She apologized , " 1 have to ask you some painful questions .... " So they knew . I said , " Yes , I 've heard the news . " And she began asking about Capa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead too ! We were like brothers , the three of to The diplomats at Geneva , " reported Life in 1954 , " signed a paper that forfeite almost everything the soldiers fought for . ' The U.S. did not sign , but pledged to support the Geneva accords ? then promptly proceeded to sabotage them . For documentation see the Pentagon Papers . The press paid scant attention . During the remaining six years of the Eisenhower term there were no resident Western press photographers in Vieinam , North or South . The action was elsewhere ; the Suez , Hungary , Algeria , Berlin , Cuba , the Congo . The glamorous young Kennedy Administration further diverted the attention of press photographers , almost to the point of euphoria . It was the slow-moving National Geographic that first caught a picture of an American soldier ready for combat , only to have the State Department talk the editors out of using it . The story , showing only the Vietnamese doing the fighting , was entitled , " Fighting the Red Tide . " No war had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serviceman , James T. Davis of Livingston , Tennessee , was killed ? the first of 45,806 as this article goes to press . Un fort LI nately , there was no picture coverage . Finally the situation was too big to be ignored , and the wire services beefed up their bureaus with first-rate men . Malcolm Browne came for Associated Press in November 1961 , Neil Sheehan for United Press International in April 1962 . On February 27 , 1962 , the AP transmitted its first Saigon news picture by radio . It ? showed an attack on Diem 's Presidential palace during an abortive C011 p arid was taken by Yuichi ( " Jackson " ) Ishizaki , an AP stringer still working in Vietnam . Then in June 1962 along came Horst Faas , the burly AP photographer who has put his stamp on press photography in Vietnam to this day , winning two Pulitzer Prizes and the grudging achniralion of his colleagues . Born in troubled Berlin iii 1933 , Faas came to Saigon after covering the brutal civil wars in Algeria and the Congo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes that would make many men turn away : a withered old woman clutching the body of a dead baby burned by napalm ; a wounded Vietnamese ranger , blood trickling from his mouth , staring glassy-eyed . Faas looked war straight in the face . While there was tin censorship , the few correspondents who probed deeply were smeared as unpatriotic by the Administration and as downright enemies by the Vietnamese . Francois Sully of Newsweek was expelled for more than a year . President Kennedy tried to get the ? Vew York Times to recall David Halberstam . Back home , editors were slow to realize the depth of feeling on all sides ? and particularly the political complexity of the situation . When , in 1963 , Malcolm Browne photographed a protesting Buddhist monk in the act of self-immolation in Saigon , it shocked many people . A great many newspapers , following the example of the New York Times , whose editors thought it " unfit for the breakfast table , " suppressed the picture or played it down . " An editor who did n't run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crucifixion , " frothed the late " Casey " Jones , editor of the Syracuse newspapers . Many atrocity pictures revealing the brutal nature of the war were available in the early Sixties . Editors for the most part ignored them as " isolated incidents . " Dickey Chapelle , the courageous ex ? Quaker who became a gung ? ho combat photographer ( and later paid the price with her life ) , took a shocking picture of a Vietcong prisoner about to he executed by his captor , a South Vietnamese soldier standing over him with drawn gun . Thai was in early 1962 . It was published only in an obscure little magazine . Yet when Eddie Adams of AP , six years later , came up with his picture of the South Vietnamese national police chief shooting a prisoner on a Saigon street , it got front-page play , in New York and around the world . The Times had changed . Meanwhile , a half-million U.S. troops had been committed to the unsavory war . Life bears a special responsibility , for better and for worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other publication has tried so hard , going back to Capa 's time . The roster of photographers who have covered it for them is remarkable : Duncan , Caps , Akihiko Okamura , Sochurek , Dominic , Burk Uzzle , Catherine Leroy , John Olson , Mark Godfrey , Co Rcntmeeister , Vernon Merritt III , David Burnett . And Larry Burrows , who came to Vietnam in 1962 ? and will remain , somewhere , in Laos . It was Thursday morning , June 8 , 1944 , in the London office of Lik on Dean Street in Soho . Larry Burrows , a skinny , bespectacled darkroom boy of eighteen , had just finished fifty-two consecutive hours of work to get out the coverage of D ? Day- by Robert Capa and six other photographers . I persuaded him to come home with me , to the flat I shared with Frank Scherschel on Upper Wimpole Street , for a few hours ' rest . Larry was in London on leave , since he had been drafted to work in the coal mines . ( " Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said when he got his notice , to conceal his disappointment at not being called to the . Royal Navy . ) Scherschel was away , flying with the Air Force over Normandy . His big bed was empty . " You take it , Larry , " I said . " No , ca n't do that , " Larry replied , and lay down on the floor . With such humility , Larry Burrows was not going to tell Life what to say about the Vietnam war . He was content to show it . Who will ever forget his story of the Marine who broke down and cried , or of the little war cripple 's return to his village , or of the Vietcong prisoners roped together , or of the grisly body count published in sickly color ? But , unfortunately , Liie missed Burrows ' point . After the Tonkin Gulf incident , Liie carried a picture spread headed . " Heroes of the Gulf of Tonkin , " praising the pilots who bombed North Vietnam : " they performed like veterans . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , he is not really responsible , exactly , and it 's very difficult to be a photographer on his side and not side with his side . This is the trap that I feel most war correspondents have fallen into , one time or another . Take Dave Duncan , who was 76 recently in New York again with his exhibition and his books , including the two anti-Viet war hooks , I Protest ! and War ir ithout Heroes . Antiwar ? They are and they are n't . Duncan has such compassion for the fighting man that his books , if one looks at and does not read them , satisfy the hawk as much as Ihedove . Duncan 's dilemma andit is not unlike that of Eddie Adams and the late Henri Huet of AP , the late Kyoichi Sawada of UPI , John Olson of Life , and many other intiwar war photographers ? was revealed when he attacked the Mylai massacre dnitographs taken by Ron Haeberle. ley were technically poor photographs , ind by themselves did not prove the itrocity ( they show bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . ' hey : orrohorated the massacre , and as such hey must rank with the most awful locuments of this or any war . Duncan challenged Haeberle ? in fact le tried to persuade the Plain Dealer that dght , since he happened to be in leveland and saw them running in the rst edition ? that the pictures were false . hincan just could not believe this atrocity ? of any U.S. servicemen . But finally , months later in a face ? to-f ace confrontation with Haeberle at one of Cornell Capa 's " Concerned Photographer " seminars at New York University , Duncan admitted that the pictures were real . Seymour Hersh , the reporter who won a Pulitzer by digging out the Mylai scandal . has said in the Columbia Journalism Review that in order to drive the story home , " television was needed ? somehow just relying on newspapers to sear the conscience of America had n't been working , or working too slowly . " But is television the answer ? Hersh referred to the CBS interview with Paul Meadlo , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the fact that Meadlo goes scot-free ( albeit for good legal reasons ) , and that public sympathy seems to lie on the side of Lieutenant Galley , makes one wonder if the public 's daily diet of televised war coverage has increased public understanding of the Vietnam war to any noticeable degree . Perhaps we have image fatigue ? A recent incident . is enlightening . On June 8 a South Vietnamese plane accidentally dropped napalm on Vietnamese civilians near Anloc . Cameramen , both still and movie , were nearby . They caught the falling bomhs and the screams of those burned as they fled the scene , including one little girl who tore her burning clothes off as she ran toward the cameras . The resulting pictures were shown by the networks and ran on front pages of most newspapers . Roth were effective . But it was the still picture that fixed the image , that called forth the editorials , that will stick in memories . In such moments it is the film that Wilds the emotional impression , but the sill that remains forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military expert , to paraphrase , is one who carefully avoids all the small errors as he sweeps on to the grand fallacy . " Thus wrote Laurence Stallings , not about Secretary of Defense McNamara but in his photographic history of The First IV orld War . Sadly , the same is true of the daily press with exceptions . The daily lies should have been apparent . They were obfuscated in the net of Pentagon press agcntry , cast so effectively over those young and na ? ve photographers who thought of each day as a separate story . The outrageous paradoxes created by such immediate vision have been fully documented in a 1967 collection of photographs published tinder the title And/or , Antonyms for Our Age . Thus it has remained to photographers who did not have to meet the deadlines of daily journalism to produce the strongest statements about the interminable war . Among them : ? Akilliko Okamura , the Iulainichi photographer whose book This Is War in Vietnam was the earliest ( 1966 ) full statement of the brutality of the war . Oddly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realizing what it meant . ? Philip Jones Griffiths , a Welshman whose Vietnam , Inc. is an all-out indictment of the American role in the war . Jones Griffiths is self-righteously strident in his condemnation of all things having to do with the U.S. ? but while he may sometimes be sloppy in fact he is acute in principle . ? Marc Riboud , a Magnum Frenchman ( Magnum is almost above nationality ) whose Face of North Vietnam subtly conveys the other side by understatement the quiet dedication to nationalism ( first ) ) and socialism ( second ) ) that has somehow escaped American makers of policy . ? Mark Jury , who went to Vietnam as just another GI and returned with a remarkable photographic diary , Vietnam Photo Book , showing Vietnam " like it is " to the soldier . Sample exchange : " ' Hello there , I 'm Dr. Norman Vincent Peale from New York . ' The trooper replied , ' Glad to meet you , sir , but I 'm happy with the doctor I have now . ' " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book but a Scholastic filmstrip . McCullin kept asking himself why he was in Vietnam ( after risking his life in Cyprus and Biafra 1 . He repeatedly questions : " I 've spoken to too many dead men ... Who needs fresh pictures ? ... Is anybody taking any notice ? " Who knows . The war goes on . A friend of Larry Burrows , learning of his death in Laos , said . " The tragedy is not that Larry died . The tragedy is that Larry died talking to the deaf . " Perhaps the world is deaf . Perhaps the world is also blind ? to Burrows ' pictures and to all the others . Conceivably , the crusade has been its own undoing . No matter how powerful the images of war these photographers have captured , our fascination tends to out weigh our horror . Photography provides insulation along with access . Pictures do n't carry the odor . War stinks . There is nothing worse than the stench of the unburied dead . If that smell could only somehow accompany the images ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
