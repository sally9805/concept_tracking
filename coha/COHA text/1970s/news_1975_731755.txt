txt The Ford Administration 's decision to seek a $10-to$11-billion increase in the defense budget , lifting spending close to $95 billion in the fiscal year beginning July 1 , should assure the first serious Congressional debate in years on the nation 's overseas interests and its military force structure . Savings are likely to be marginal from reduction in the number of troops stationed abroad , even in East Asia , where the substantial numbers remaining after American withdrawal from Vietnam can be logically challenged . There is little room for further reductions in over-all military manpower , which already has been cut by 600,000 from the pre-Vietnam level of 2.7 million ? while the Soviet Union keeps 3.5 million men under arms . The chief cause of the staggering Pentagon budget , despite these troop reductions , lies in the high manpower cost of a volunteer army , which is taking about 55 per cent of military spending this year , double that of the Soviet Union 's much larger forces .

Average basic pay is now almost three times the pre-Vietnam level and pay for recruits Is more than four times that of a decade ago . The fact that pay in the lower ranks has been raised to the civilian level hardly justifies the inflated allowances , other benefits and tax advantages that have been given , along with pay increases , to officers from the grade of lieutenant colonel up . Their total compensation , which now appears to be well above that of comparable civilians , requires thorough Congressional study . ? The Pentagon is centering Its budget case on the impact of inflation on weapons procurement and operational costs . As against outlays of $95 billion next year , the Pentagon for the first time in history will be asking more than $100 billion in obligational authority , perhaps considerably more , which assures sharp increases in defense spending in future years . These requests will be hard to contest if the Congress assumes that the force structure , bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improved . In fact , Congress itself is responsible for two kinds of useless expenditure . There are scores of bases in the United States that serve little military purpose . And much of the $6 billion expended annually on reserve forces  --  such as National Guard divisions that would take almost as long to ready for combat as untrained draftees  --  could be saved or applied to highly trained ready-reserve forces that , at much lower cost , could substitute for units in active divisions and air wings . But these costs are small compared to the armed services ' waste of billions of dollars on obsolescent B-52 and FB-111 strategic bomber wings ; on programs for new , Oversophisticated F-14 and F-15 fighters ( that the Air Force and Navy already are moving to replace in part with cheaper , lightweight planes ) ; on four separate tactical air forces for the Navy , Air Force , Marines and Army .

Congressional sound and fury in the past have rarely brought more than symbolic defense cuts . The approach of a $100-billion defense budget has to stimulate far more vigorous efforts at reform . .
