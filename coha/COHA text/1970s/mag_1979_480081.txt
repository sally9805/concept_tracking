THERE STILL IS the tendency to look upon that army of ex-colonies that marched into the United Nations during the 1960s as heralding some sudden , new , dramatic , revolutionary change in the way the world works , and to consider the Caribbean a crucial geopolitical laboratory , where events must prove one or another of the ideologies contending for our time right or wrong . But time can move sideways , events march toward anticlimax . To look today at what has happened to Jamaica is like looking at the movie stars one sees vacationing , without makeup , at Round Hill near Montego Bay . One recognizes the face , but finds little of the old glamour in those momentous issues supposed to have been decided in emerging nations like this one , when they are exposed to the bright Jamaica sunshine . Fashions in world politics change , but small poor countries like Jamaica re main the same prisms reflecting not just the obsessions , but the vast carelessnesses of the rich . Our clandestine operations may no longer destabilize their governments , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribe their cabinet ministers . But as recent events in Jamaica have shown , a tourist with a camera can incite as much discontent as an agent provocateur , a Washington loan can be as destabilizing as a trade embargo , our beneficence can diminish a people , too . At the time Jamaica became the Caribbean 's largest independent democracy in 1962 , it was President Kennedy 's conviction that there could be no middle ground between Communist apocalypse and American grace . " New nations , " Kennedy announced , must " choose between competing systems . " In order to make the right choice , he urged , " they need only compare the disillusionment of Communist Cuba with the promise of the Alliance for Progress . " Jamaica ? its foreign-owned bauxite industry at that time supplying 90 percent of the American aluminum industry 's needs ; its beaches ripe for tourist promotion ; its government , even after independence , dominated by a small , disproportionately white Anglophile elite ? did not hesitate to make its choice . In a day of missile crises and cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's loyal little friend . On Independence Day Jamaica 's prime minister , Sir Alexander Bustamante , announced " the irrevocable decision that Jamaica stands with the West and the United States . " Yet over the next decade the comparison Kennedy urged did not cease to grow more and more unedifying . While Cuba achieved fundamental , if overromanticized reforms , the CIA gerrymandered Guyana , Lyndon Johnson raped the Dominican Republic , and when Richard Nixon was not sending Nelson Rockefeller to Haiti to embrace Papa Doc , he was naming big contributors to the Committee to Reelect the President as his plenipotentiaries in island nations . One of Nixon 's ambassadors to Jamaica , Vincent W. de Roulet , evidently warned that it was impolitic to call the Jamaicans " natives , " opted instead to refer to them as " niggers " at official functions . His successor , a statesman by comparison , spent his time playing polo . By 1974 , Jamaica was a case study in malign neglect . Though its annual per capita income , at $1,000 , was high for Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed in favor of Jamaica 's small , mostly fair-skinned elite that 85 percent of its people were subsisting on incomes of less than $200 a year . Britain had closed its doors to Jamaican immigration , and at least a quarter of the island 's work force was unemployed . Inflation was close to 30 percent . Jamaica 's share of the L.S. bauxite market was declining as the multinational corporations diversified their supplies , and the bottom was about to fall out of the sugar market . While leaders of the opposition Jamaica Labor Party and the ruling People 's National Party denounced each other in ornate parliamentary addresses , rival gangs , al . lied to each of the major parties , shot it out in the slums of West Kingston . Most important , the higher oil prices in 1973 had broken the back of the Jamaican economy , which is entirely dependent on imported energy . Jamaica always had been shortchanged by British and North American capital . Now , in the name of a fairer deal for the Third World , it was being beggared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Venezuelans . T HE SURPRISING THING is not that politicians in Kingston finally reacted against Jamaica 's allotted place in the American Caribbean order , but that the reaction ? like the recent popular disturbances against the deteriorating standard of living ? was so long in coming , and so short-lived , and produced so few results . Jamaica 's charismatic prime minister , Michael Manley , had visited Havana as early as 1961 ; and like most of the West Indian elite , whose idea of radicalism derives from Harold Laski 's lectures at the London School of Economics , not from any experience of a guerrilla struggle for independence , Manley had decided that the Cuban experiment could never last . But in late 1973 . Manley journeyed with Fidel Castro to the nonaligned conference in Algiers . The experience amounted to what Manley himself described as a " revelation , " what his adversaries soon denounced as an unseemly and opportunistic infatuation with radical chic , Cuban style . The son of one Jamaican prime minister , and the relation of two of Jamaica 's three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of Havana , to denounce the privileges of the island 's small and clubby political elite . Soon the Jamaican leader ? white enough to be mistaken for an Englishman on his trips abroad ? was proclaiming his solidarity with liberation movements from Indochina to Namibia . Manley soon increased taxes on the aluminum companies from $30 million to $200 million a year and established diplomatic relations with Cuba , China , and the Soviet Union . He announced that Jamaica was forsaking capitalism for " democratic socialism , " revoking its " irrevocable decision " to stand with America in favor of a policy of " self-assertion against a colonial past . " Manley 's approach paid off handsomely in Jamaica , where 90 percent of the people are black and poor , in the 1976 elections . Promising to march " hand in hand " with Cuba internationally . to abolish the monarchy at home ( Queen Elizabeth was still head of state , fourteen years after independence ) , and to establish a new " form of relationship in which workers share in the ownership , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island like an Old Testament prophet , offering a New International Economic Order . " Joshua , Joshua , " the crowds cried wherever he went . No one could mistake Manley 's opponent , Edward Seaga , leader of the Jamaica Labor Party , for a prophet . Seaga , whose adversaries sometimes spell his name C-I-A-g-a , is a suave businessman of Lebanese descent , a Harvard graduate with close ties to both the aluminum companies and the gangs of West Kingston . He vowed it would be the end of democracy if Manley won , but many Jamaicans ? fearful of Seaga 's connections with the Americans and local political violence ? considered Manley the lesser risk . While high officials in the Ford Administration , hamstrung by the Watergate and CIA scandals , muttered impotently about an emerging " Cuba-Jamaica-Guyana axis . " the campaign saw scores of Jamaicans killed or wounded . When the votes were counted , Manley had won a four-to-one majority in the Jamaican House of Representatives . Lauding the Jamaican prime minister as " a sincere friend of the Cuban revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of special importance " against " imperialism and internal reaction . " If most analysts agreed that yet again American arrogance had turned a friend into an enemy , and made the prediction of left-wing ascendance in the Caribbean a self-fulfilling prophecy , the only question remaining was whether Jamaica 's lurch to the Left , like Cuba 's , could be contained . " Jamaica appears on the verge of a political explosion , " even so calm an analyst of events as the Christian Science Monitor believed , " that could send shock waves across the Caribbean . " c ONSIDERING what has happened in Jamaica since the 1976 elections , it was fitting that I arrived there in a U.S. military transport plane , and that the first Jamaican official I encountered , an employee of the tourist board , offered me a complimentary rum cocktail , not a lecture on imperialism . Though it still is considered of some moment that Havana over the past few years has opened a technical school here , built a few leaky dams in the mountains , provided one small public-housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of its 2.1 million Jamaican neighbors , it is less noticed that the troubled Jamaican economy receives rather more substantial support from the opposite end of the island of Cuba . As the number of Cuban employees at the American naval base at Guam tanamo Bay has dwindled , Jamaican bartenders and gardeners have taken their place . Their dollar remittances , sent back to relatives in Jamaica , exceed the annual total of Cuban assistance . For opponents of the Carter Administration 's aid program here , like Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah , Jamaica remains no more than " a captive of Cuba , " and Prime Minister Manley an English-speaking Castro . But for the Pentagon logistics system , Jamaica is no different from Puerto Rico or Haiti , just another one of those pieces of Caribbean real estate where U.S. military supply planes are free to land as they please . To do its bit to rid the Caribbean of the imperialist past , Jamaica need only forbid its citizens from stafKILLING JAMAICA WITH KINDNESS fing the last Yankee outpost on fraternal Cuban soil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt would do more to imperil the Guantanamo base than all the manifestos so far enacted at all the nonaligned conferences . But three years after the supposed triumph of radicalism here , the shock waves have failed to wash ashore . When Jamaicans take to the streets now , it is not to fight for the revolution , but to protest the dwindling supplies of meat , the soaring price of kerosene . It is not Jamaica that is sending shock waves across the Caribbean , but Jamaica itself that is being traumatized by the forces of the U.S.-sanctioned international economic order . Jamaica 's rhetorical relationship with Havana and its economic relationship with Guantanamo in fact arc emblematic of what has happened . Openings to the Left have yielded little but big headlines , scared away foreign tourists and investors , and made Jamaicans themselves clamor for immigration visas at the American and Canadian missions . Meanwhile Jamaica finds it does receive at least a steady supply of crumbs when it waits on the white man 's table . Today the bauxite mines remain foreign-owned : Jamaica still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking for a poor , black nation , and Andrew Young , a black man representing a rich , white nation , now commune in perfect empathy . It seems no accident that Jimmy Carter , with his rural southern roots , should have enjoyed one of his most spectacular if least consequential policy triumphs here . Truth to tell , Jamaica these days is like a sharecropper who has received a Christmas basket from his landlord . At $30 million a year , Jamaica currently is the largest recipient , on a per capita basis , of American aid in the Western Hemisphere , but it is as far , perhaps further away than ever , from being master of its own house . These days Manley still visits Havana , and receives the plenipotentiaries of Peking ; indeed , he does so with the Carter Administration 's tolerant blessing . But there has been an economic revolution here only to the extent that the value of the Jamaican dollar is now controlled in Washington , while the value of the Jamaican pound was once set in London . Jamaica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Monetary Fund as it was under the control of the British Treasury during the days of colonialism . The $1 billion American private investment here is safe ; Americans are no longer stoned on the streets but welcomed as friends . The most influential foreigner in Kingston is the U.S. Ambassador , Frederick Irving , who neither plays polo nor treats the Jamaicans with disrespect . Two or three years ago , the question was whether American selfishness and arrogance would force Jamaica irrevocably into the Cuban orbit . Today the answer is clear . After so many mean-minded American policies leading to so many American defeats in this part of the world , there has been a triumph of American good intentions in Jamaica . Andrew Young and Rosalynn Carter have come here , and demonstrated their good intentions . The U.S. embassy here has been instructed to be well-intentioned , and it follows its instructions enthusiastically . Mr. Manley , a well-intentioned man , knows a well-intentioned President when he sees one , and has announced that U.S.-Jamaican relations have entered a new era . The only question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good intentions , for our well-intentioned fiscal policies are pushing poor Jamaicans deeper into poverty , while our well-intentioned immigration policies encourage affluent Jamaicans to desert their country for Miami and New York . Far from becoming an English-speaking Castro , Prime Minister Manley has become the Caribbean Harold Wilson , Jamaica under his rule a land where " socialism " is dispensed like Valium , not to cure ills but to distract the patient from his problems . w E ARE EMBARKED , " the prime minister announced in 1976 , " upon an orderly transition from one society based on one set of human values to another based on new forms of relationship . " Both the poor of Jamaica , who cheered those words , and the tourists , who stayed away when they beard them , at first took Manley at his word , but today it is all too clear that neither was right . Every day the jets shuttle a few rich Jamaicans and many rich foreigners in half an hour between Kingston , where recently an Inter-Continental Hotel has sprouted among the shanties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual bill for imported oil now runs about $100 a person a year in a country where whole families must live on half that a month , and every Friday the Jaguars and Audis of the Kingston elite make the run up to the north coast beaches in a few hours . For the rest there is a tiny , tired train that on good days makes the journey of 123 miles in seven hours . At Spanish Town , the shanties run down to the railroad tracks , and grinning , toothless children cling to the train 's windows , with sugar cane for sale . At May Pen , the blind beggars alight , to repeat their mendications in the opposite direction when the next train comes along . The MoBay train has no air conditioning , no reclining seats , but even here one finds replications of distinctions going back to the days of the great plantations . In first class , one 's fellow passengers are the descendants of an Indian clerk or a Chinese merchant . The man in the black coat with the furled umbrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorkshireman , and when two youths with second-class tickets , wearing blue jeans and Afros and polyester shirts open to the waist , first hang about the door , then edge their way to a first-class seat , the conductor is summoned . Tickets are inspected , and they are shooed back into the other compartment , a compression box of black faces and white teeth , where some stand in the aisles for the trip across the whole island and there are only two kinds of windows : those that can not be opened in the heat , and those that will not close in the rain . At Mandeville , in the highlands , the Free World 's most important source of bauxite is another poor village standing beside an immense hole in the ground ; one must visit a bank in England or an aircraft factory in America to find where all Jamaica 's wealth has gone . In villages with names like Comfort Hall and Merrywood and Stonehenge , one sees a few people scratching red earth , planting yams , harvesting a little cassava . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cultivated land in Jamaica is owned by 3,000 people , and since 1974 the world price of sugar has dropped from 65 cents a pound to about 8 cents . So in these tired green hills people can drink their fill of Appleton rum , but they have no money for the national staple , salt fish ? imported from England because even though 60 percent of all Jamaicans by now were born after independence , they still do not fish the seas that surround their island . They cut cane for sugar that Britain , now in the Common Market , no longer buys , to trade for North Sea cud . Malnutrition , unknown even before emancipation , when Jamaica 's plantation economy already had started to break down , is now a fact of life . On the train , as in the land through which it passes , poverty is mingled with music , and hunger with literacy . Women discuss how they no longer can afford soap in accents Shakespeare might have understood ; and when a book seller in rags boards the train , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Milton and Eldridge Cleaver , as well as Agatha Christie . For 400 years Europe has discounted everything it buys here , and marked up everything it sells . The people are hard-working and 70 percent literate , a phenomenal rate for this part of the world . But what does all that matter , when ? so many centuries after the trade in slaves and molasses hegan ? " there is , " as Prime Minister Manley once earnestly argued on the op-ed page of the New York Times , " still a great need for a systemic change in both the principles and the methods upon which international trade is based " ? - Past a town called Anchovy the train begins a corkscrew descent through a gaudy sunset to Montego Bay , where for the first time since leaving Kingston one hears the roar of jet engines , the buzz of air conditioners , the disco beat , sees head lamps , streetlights , neon lights , sees Americans , Canadians , Germans getting away from it all . On the railroad 's steepest jungle inclines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb onto the roof of the speeding train and , arms outstretched , balance their way down the mountainside like surfers , negotiating the tops of palm trees instead of waves ; but once in Montego Bay a metamorphosis occurs . The tourists land at the airport in traveling suits , carrying many a valise ; they go to their hotels , and take off as much clothing as possible . The Jamaicans arrive at the trainstation threadbare , carrying perhaps a plastic bag ; they go downtown to the little cots they rent in shacks where people sleep six to a room , and put on a full suit of clothes . So in a few hours one of the train-surfers is wearing a tuxedo , as he serves a rum confection to a stockbroker dressed in boutique sneakers and matching red disco shorts . A German in a bathing suit takes an evening stroll in the hotel garden , and is approached from the shadows by a village girl wearing patent leather high heels , net stockings , a calf-length cocktail dress , and a hat . By midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with unemployed Jamaicans wearing local copies of Pierre Cardin three-piece suits . w HAT MANLY had not considered was that when he promised " democratic socialism " in Kingston , or praised Castro to the international press , the travel agents in America were listening . Following his victory in the 1976 elections , the peak-season hotel occupancy rate , which had been 71 percent , dropped to as low as 18 percent . Foreign-exchange earnings from tourism , which had reached $120 million a year , were cut in half . In the end , it was a much smaller sum that scuttled Jamaica 's brief experiment with economic independence , and gave the Manley government , for all its promises to break out of Jamaica 's " present system of economic arrangements " with the rich nations , as the prime minister had put it , no choice but to smile back when Jimmy Carter smiled ? and then swallow hard as the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) dictated Jamaica 's economic future . Following his electoral victory , Manley found himself in a position that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically what he preached politically . The voters had given him a mandate to enact millennial reforms . But Jamaica 's soaring energy bill and the collapse of the tourist and sugar markets meant he could hardly meet next month 's invoices to OPEC and the Americans , let alone finance a new national order . The amount of money Jamaica needed to borrow seemed small , some $30 million . The terms the IMF proposed amounted to nothing less than the abrogation of Jamaica 's economic independence : a 40 percent devaluation of the Jamaican dollar ; even lower living standards and even higher unemployment for the poor , on the theory that this would cut inflation ; tax breaks for the rich and the multinational corporations , on the assumption that that would increase production . Never mind that such policies stabilized money markets only by destabilizing nations . The economic bureaucrats in Washington had the money ; Jamaica could take the IMF 's terms , or leave them . In January , 1977 , following the IMF ultimatum , Manley did what any leader of an independent nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMF 's terms , and like Nasser after Dulles refused to build the Aswan Dam , the prime minister of Jamaica went shopping , or , more accurately speaking , put himself up for sale . But the 1970s are not the 1960s. and the Caribbean . for all the strategic alarums it sometimes still provokes , remains what it has been since the seventeenth century ? a balkanized backwater . The Russians , already enjoying the geopolitical privilege of subsidizing one Caribbean island at the rate of $1 billion a year , offered the Jamaicans less money , on more stringent terms , than the IMF . The OPEC nations expressed gratification at Jamaica 's newfound solidarity with their struggle for a new international economic order ; they added that their petrol prices would remain the same . In Africa , in nations even poorer than his own , Manley was welcomed as a Third World brother . The Chinese were generous with lectures on the dangers of fake revolution , Allende style . Fidel Castro , owing Moscow $9 billion himself , could offer Jamaica no hard currencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haile Selassie of Ethiopia , many years earlier , had stopped over in Kingston , and the Rastafarians -- sure the hour of the deliverance to the African Zion was at hand ? had gathered by the hundreds of thousands at Palisadoes airport , did the advent of a foreign leader arouse such expectations . At a diplomatic reception , Castro sought out the American Ambassador and cordially shook his hand . In priKILLING JAMAICA WITH KINDNESS vate , he informed the Jamaicans they must learn to " live with capitalism a little longer . " And then he flew away , leaving the Fabian socialists of the People 's National Party where the Emperor of Ethiopia earlier had left those who worship him as a god in the Kingston slums . Meanwhile , in Washington , realpolitik and dirty tricks were out of fashion ; Jimmy Carter and his human.rights crusade were in . The IMF terms had not changed , but now Andrew Young would administer them , in a sugar pill . The result is that while two or three years ago Jamaica was a land that scared tourists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm its own people . Rosalynn Carter 's arriving in Kingston has not stopped half the professional class from leaving ? and provided they arrive at Kennedy Airport with skills and cash , our new , nonracist immigration policy welcomes them in . A check for $30 million from the IMF has not stopped more than f1300 million from being smuggled out of Jamaica , nor have the smiles from Washington filled the stomachs of the poor . Five percent of the population stilt controls 90 percent of Jamaica 's wealth , but there is no evidence that , under the IMF 's new conditions , it is being used any less unproductively than before . There are changes : Jamaicans no longer simply hustle tourists , they now beg from each other . There always has been poverty here , but now there is hunger , too . The solution : Cut the labor force more , the international experts advise ; import American machines to make your sugar crop more competitive . Curry at the kind of roadside stands poor Jamaicans frequent now costs as much as it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose people no longer can afford razor blades , meat , 60-watt bulbs , bicycle tires , and batteries for their transistor radios . If the bad news is that Jamaica has tried to act out its illusion of economic independence , and failed , the good news is that as a result the island once again has become a fun place for foreign tourists . Under " democratic socialism " Jamaica has not altered the relationship between one class and another ; it nonetheless has developed an exciting new tourist strategy . All along , the main problem for the Jamaican tourist industry has been that Jamaica is not a beach , but a country of more than 2 million people ; that places like Montego Bay are not outposts of Paradise , but cities where real people live . Under Jamaica 's new policy , the emphasis is no longer on the all-purpose resort , with hotels being built where most Jamaicans live and try to work . Instead , the new tourist attractions are located as far away as possible from the life of Jamaica itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist swinging singles , liberated couples , the super-rich , widows . From Montego Bay I drove fifty miles to Negril , on the western tip of the island , as far removed from Kingston as one can get in Jamaica . The theme of the government-owned resort here , called Negril Beach Village , is " Hedonism , " and for less than $500 a week , single occupancy , one can inhabit a kind of Disneyland for the singles-bar crowd . There are scuba-diving lessons in the morning , and est sessions on a tropical atoll . One can dress up like a pirate for a cruise on a frigate . By mid-afternoon the discotheque beneath the swimming pool has reached a pitch of frenzy that Studio 54 does not achieve until four A.M. In the evening , male guests compete in a wet bikini contest . The prize is a large banana , presented by a Jamaican entertainer in a gold lame dress , but what draws the young crowd here , from as far away as Illinois and Stuttgart , is the nude beach , off limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn the couples are still intertwined in the garden . One evening , finding the staff had been instructed not to play reggae music , I strolled past the buffet tables full of lobster and free Calico Jack , out onto the main road where the poor of the countryside come to catch and eat the great land crabs that abound here the way squirrels do in New York 's Central Park . At the reggae bar a few miles down the road I asked the Jamaican who offered to sell me cocaine what his ambition was . His hair was braided in the Rastafarian manner ; he was dressed in blue jeans he said a tourist had given him . " To get out of here , " he replied . " Go someplace good , like Brooklyn . Nostrand Avenue . Eastern Parkway . I can see myself there . " Was I familiar , he wanted to know , with the 1RT ? At night in Negril , when one swims out as far as one can into the Caribbean , one 's body excites the phosphorescence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water seems to merge with the Milky Way . Two hundred yards out in the soft , warm current , the sound of the disco music from the hotel is still louder than the waves . It can be heard in the little plantation hamlets for miles around . I T IS THE COMPLAINT of the international economists , and of the foreign experts in Third World development , that the Jamaican is scornful of tilling the soil . Even in small places like Lucea and Savannala-Mar it is true that wherever Jamaicans live together , one finds the dynamics of a town , not the processes of a village . At almost every crossroads , it seems , a woman has opened a beauty parlor ; a man with a Bible has started a church . There is a rum shop and a radio repair shop . Children sell used flashlights while young men take apart old cars and put them back together again . Here , on an island where even the telephone poles seem to take root and grow fruit , food imports make one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew in a light plane across the island back to Kingston , and saw at a few thousand feet what is not apparent from a jet , nor from the ground : how empty this overcrowded island is . True , the interior is mountainous , most of the shoreline rocky or swampy ? not lined with beaches as one might infer from the tourist ads ? but no more so than the islands of the East Indies , on the other side of the world , where the climate is identical , the economy similar , the colonial background somewhat the same ? and everywhere the land reveals its long productive relationship with man . Looking down on the empty forests , one remembers that this island is a homeland no one ever chose . Columbus , searching for Cipango in 1494 , found Jamaica instead . By the seventeenth century , Jamaica 's only real " natives , " the gentle and peaceful Arawak Indians , were all dead . Almost every Jamaican today is the descendant of those who did not want to come here : of African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors who jumped ship or fled here to escape their debts . In countries like Indonesia and the Philippines , the poor have a friendship with the land , but the whole history of Jamaica , from the slave revolts to the current efforts at industrialization , is a history of the struggle to escape the land , to emancipate oneself from the plantation . Today there are about ? million Jamaicans in the world , and for all but a small proportion of them , that mountainous countryside of sugar and tropical fruits , of life centered on the white man 's fields , the Chinese shop , the Indian moneylender , and the Low Anglican church , is a life they have put behind them forever . A million or more Jamaicans live in the United States , mostly in the New York City and Miami areas . A similar number are in Britain , Canada , and other Commonwealth countries , and today a million more Jamaicans ? about half the island 's population ? have wedged themselves into a dry , low-lying , and infertile pocket of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs to the land , looking out to Africa , Britain , America . No tourists come to Kingston . but here the discotheques , with names like Epiphany and 2001 , are more crowded than those in Montego Bay . At night the German-and American-theme restaurants in St. Andrew are packed , and Jamaicans crowd drive-in restaurants with names like Trafalgar Square . The tourists come to Jamaica to act out some illusion of Paradise ; for Jamaicans the thing is to pretend you are in London or New York . In both the interior of the island and in Kingston one is reminded of that cold sadness Conrad saw pervading even the most exuberant tropical lands . For some Jamaica is a vacation , for others an exercise in economics , or a Caribbean domino , or a test case for a certain foreign policy : a nation all too few people , Jamaican or foreign . love for itself . The rival gangs of West Kingston negotiated a peace treaty last year , so the city ? which is structured like an American one , with clumps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and from cool suburbs in the hills is no longer a place of random terror , in spite of the recent disturbances . What Kingston remains , even more than a city of music , is a city of words . Like the Indians and the Americans , the Jamaicans. who are also an incorrigibly democratic people , value words for their own sake . On Jamaican radio the political call-in shows are the most popular , and when The Gleaner , the island 's largest newspaper , recently sold stock , it was snapped up ? in this country , where there is no money for salt fish and gasoline-. ? in lots of $50 in a matter of weeks . So being in Kingston is a little like being in Washington or New Delhi . The city trades on words , and they acquire a currency of their own . One does not hear the names of Henry Kissinger or Fidel Castro mentioned just at diplomatic cocktail parties ; they are discussed in the little market stalls surrounding Victoria Park . Will Jamaica stay with the West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's economics , people ask each other , or fear Seaga 's connections with the CIA more ? Hardly a day goes by that the newspapers do not prove their own editorials wrong , by freely pubtishing the most lurid accounts of the death of freedom of the press ; hardly a week when the prime minister must not make his excuses to a hostile crowd accusing him of cruelly stifling open dissent . The rich complain about the high cost of cars , the poor about the price of cloth . But everyone in Kingston seems to have the price of a ticket to a concert , theater , or ballet , whether in an air-conditioned auditorium or a sweaty hall . In Trenchtown the poor debate politics in loud voices on street corners ; in New Kingston the professionals attend a political cabaret . Nowhere has one that sense , so frequent in the rest of the Caribbean , of being watched . OTH TO FOREIGNERS and to Jamaicans , all that is indigenous about Jamaica is epitomized by Rastafara ? its music , its philosophy , its style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about just what Rastafarians are . Some are gangs of hoods . Some Rastafarian temples are really temples to music , some of the most original in the world . Some Rastafarians are pious people , doing work without notice among the poor-est of Kingston 's poor . But what all Rastafarians share is the belief that all this ? the slums and the luxury hotels : the price of oil and the value of the Jamaican dollar ; the Cuban model and the American model ; the People 's National Party and the Jamaica Labor Party ? can not go on forever . Tomorrow morning when he awakes , or fifty years from now just before he dies , the Rastafarian will be emancipated from the whole , long , funny , horrible historical mistake that began when his **35;3299;TOOLONG strayed too close to the white man 's ship . He will be wafted back to Mount Zion in Africa . There , in the company of saints like Marcus Garvey and Haile Selassie , he will become his real self again . " Jamaica , " Brother Sam Clayton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to read , told me , " is only our home away from home . " This is a country where the national instrument is the electric guitar and the basic cultural sound comes out of an American amplifier . Bob Marley , quintessential Jamaican , lives in London , and on visits to Kingston he is received like Castro or Andrew Young . Like the Jamaican doctors lining up for immigrant visas at the American embassy , like the radicals back from study tours of Cuba , like the waiters and bar girls in their fashions copied from foreign magazines , the Rastafarian is a Jamaican who does not want to be one . But Haile Selassie , no more than Harold Laski , can not give a Jamaican a job , and not long ago , when the American Ambassador in Kingston visited a temple of Rastafara to encourage it in its good works , one of the faithful gave him a Bible .

On my last night in Kingston , before flying out on a plane full of Jamaicans going to New York to stay , I attended one of those glittering occasions of Creole society . Like the country people marching barefoot to church in their Sunday best , this occasion had much charm and a little sadness .

They had gathered to say good-bye to a man with an African face and a European doctorate , named Melbourne , who was going to work for a bank in America . He was one of the country 's foremost economists . All the magnates were there ; the minister of finance was there . As port was passed to the left , the after-dinner speakers emphasized how much Melbourne would be missed , in the course of this temporary assignment ; how much his nation needed him , how it would welcome him back when his work in America was done . Jamaica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ambassador to the world of international finance . The assumption that the man would never return was unspoken , until he spoke : It was absurd , he suggested , in a jovial , postprandial way intended to make diplomatic the brunt of what he had to say , for a few people to sit on a small island talking about national sovereignty in an age like this one , when corporate vice-presidents have larger budgets than ministers of finance , the Mafia better-equipped armed forces . Everywhere microstates were being overwhelmed by macroeconomics . One no more could pretend that America was just another foreign country than Finland could imagine that the Soviet Union did not exist . In a world drunk on the politics of nationalism , the multinationals and Common Markets and the flow of money and people across sovereign frontiers were economic facts no one could stop . The Russians were building Pepsi factories , the Chinese buying computers . The world had to be taken as it was , not as one imagined it should be : Why , even Cuba was building eighty-five resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talk of " democratic socialism " and dreams of Zion , remains a way station , where sojourners find themselves for a while . It always has been like that in the Caribbean . When the traffic in slaves was profitable , and Europe 's need for rum and pepper and cane sugar acute , whole peoples were uprooted , brought across an ocean to form the colonial plantations we now expect to act as nation-states . Today the region is doing what it has been doing since Europe discovered the sugar beet and refrigeration , since the Industrial Revolution suddenly made slavery , that most labor-intensive of all economic systems , a heinous offense . Because of vast changes elsewhere , over which islands like Jamaica have no control , today another kind of society is being uprooted . The rich and clever flee , while those who remain go deeper and deeper into debt . In the Caribbean the politics of this process really does not matter , in the sense that politics can not reverse its flow . Cuba has its debts to Moscow , Martinique its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helped Castro build socialism on one island by taking his middle class ; and while the IMF totes up the bills and Jimmy Carter expresses gratification that there are human rights in Jamaica , the larger fact is that the slums of Kingston and the villages around Negril are today no further from downtown America than the hamlets of Mississippi and South Carolina were from Harlem and Chicago in 1910 . We dictate fiscal terms to their treasury while their doctors and scullery maids remake our cities . Our tourists , seeking escape , bring dreams of Forty-second Street to the plantation ; to the extent that our policies influence it , we bring the Third World within our own doors . The illusion of independence was the same illusion in the Kennedy rhetoric : that we , and they , could choose . The truth is that we loom too large and rich , and they are much too poor , and near , for that .
