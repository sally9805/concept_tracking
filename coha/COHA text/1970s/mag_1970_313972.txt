The blasts that demolished four hijacked airliners in the Middle East last week had more than political repercussions . They created shock waves in airline head offices round the world , threw the aviation insurance market into a tailspin , and endangered delicate arrangements for financing the new generation of jumbo jets . <P> The problems created by the destruction of a Pan American World Airways 747 in Cairo at the beginning of the week were indicative of the industry 's dilemma . The 747 , insured for $24.5 million , was covered by two kinds of policies- " all risk " insurance , placed largely with a U.S. consortium , and " war risk " protection , 60% underwritten by Lloyd 's of London and 40% by the U.S. Government . " All risk " encompasses normal flight hazards including , in U.S. practice , damage to a plane hijacked to Cuba . " War risk " covers loss by enemy action during war . But nowadays , what is a war ? There remains a range for debate as to whether the hijacking was a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an act of war by the Palestinian fedayeen-and which insuring group is liable . <P> If the " war risk " insurers are indeed found liable for Pan Am 's 747 , then the Federal Government will be out about $9.7 million , or 40% of the plane 's value . Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 , Washington may offer such insurance when private firms are unwilling to sell it at reasonable rates . The companies had declined to provide more than partial coverage for the costly 747s . The Federal Government therefore agreed to make up the difference for jumbo jets on international flights , starting last July 31 . Washington 's insurance fund is so new that premiums had brought in only $160,000 by last week . The rest will probably have to be made up by congressional appropriation . <P> Insurance men can calculate with reasonable accuracy the risk of crashes from aircraft failure , pilot error or weather . But hijacking is so new that insurers do not yet have enough experience to predict its probable frequency . Last week airline offices round the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceling coverage for hijackings-reports that Lloyd 's vigorously denied . What was happening was that Lloyd 's members were taking advantage of their options to raise " war risk " insurance premiums by 25% to 100% because of the increasing haz ards . Such action comes at a particularly awkward time for U.S. airlines . Pan Am , for example , lost $19.6 million in the first half of 1970 , and higher " war risk " premiums might add millions of dollars to its operating costs without increasing revenues at all . <P> Test of Ingenuity . The insurance tangle threatened to upset future financing arrangements for jumbo jets because the consortiums that finance many naturally insist on full coverage as a condition of their loans . Pan Am 's 747 was owned by First National City Bank of New York , but mainly financed by a group of other banks pending an offer of guaranteed loan certificates to the public later this month . After the explosion , the offer was withdrawn until new arrangements can be devised .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
