txt Mayor Lindsay yesterday ordered the elimination of more than 800 full-time and 2,000 part-time and temporary city jobs , effective May 1 , and said he would make public " staggering " potential cuts today for the budget year starting July 1 . Victor Gotbaum , executive director of the largest city employes ' union , said later that he had heard today 's move might raise the threat of a loss of up to 50,000 city jobs out of about 350,000 . The Mayor estimated that his order yesterday would save more than $10-million a year . It involved only agencies under his direct jurisdiction , in which 1,500 jobs out of perhaps 137 , - 000 had already been eliminated in the last six months . Neighborhood Offices Shut The order included closing all 40 neighborhood Urban Action Task Force offices , and cancel ? ing the planned hiring of 150 sanitationmen and 75 firemen . It eliminated 360 part-time school-crossing guards and 1,850 temporary jobs for college and graduate students in city agencies . It dropped 82 out of 160 members of the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up one Staten Island ferryboat , and drastically trimmed city planning , information and community relations staffs . " The cuts are permanent , " Mr. Lindsay told newsmen last night after passing a 30-member picket line of protesting planning employes , before recording his weekly WNEW-TV broadcast . " This is not a scare tactic . " State Aid Sought The cuts to be announced today are frankly planned by Mr. Lindsay as a dramatic bid for help from the " state legislative leadership , " which has already drastically cut Governor I Rockefeller 's proposed $8.45-billion , state budget by $760-million . The bid today would outline in more than 100 pages the prospective cuts under present available resources in such mayoral agencies as the Police Department as well as in independent bodies drawing much of their budgets from the city . Among the latter agencies , the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation has already predicted layoffs of up to 18,000 employes and 2,000 physicians , given the present outlook . The Board of Education has been given a city projection //  - -  - that envisions cutting off 11,250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been called for tomorrow at 4 P.M , for the steering committee of the Municipal Labor Committee , representing nearly all unions of city employes . The meeting will be held at the headquarters of Mr. Gotbaum 's District Council 37 , State , County and Municipal Employes , at 365 Broadway . Mr. Gotbaum said yesterday 's order could be absorbed by shifting workers with permanent status and seniority , and by displacing others . But cuts in service forecast by the two worst of four options to be outlined today , he said , would mean " we can no longer talk of the city deteriorating ; now we 're talking about the destruction of the city . " Even with the expected union and community support , the city faces difficulty in its lobbying effort to get the Republican-led State Legislature to rescind some $200-million in cuts in state aid for the next city budget . or to induce the legislators to give Mayor Lindsay . the $880-million in new taxing power he has sought . Only last week Governor Rockefeller told newsmen here that Mayor lindsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced , in which he would have to drop 8,000 to 10,000 statejobs out of about 145,000 by the end of the state budget year next March 31 to save $200maillion . Mr. Rockefeller then , proposed that Mr. Lindsay look to cut " low-priority " services . Mr , Gotbaum , the city union leader , said he understood that most of the state cuts would be made by leaving jobs unfilled as vacancies developed . City officials held privately that the 2,300 full-time city jobs under the Mayor 's direct control eliminated thus far compared with a possible likely state total of 2,500 actual jobholders facing layoffs . However , the city count also includes only 500 provisional employes actually dismissed last December , with 1,000 positions estimated as picked up from a job freeze started last October . Depression Years Recalled Nevertheless the city was undergoing the first mass layoffs even of professionals since the Depression . In the Depression , the 1933 and 1934 budgets were balanced by pay cuts and payless furloughs authorized by the . State Legislature . ? Yesterday it became known that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layoffs was being circulated in the City Planning Department , Mr. Gotbaum , the city union chief , charged that " a lot signed under coercion , " and said that Herbert L. Haber , the city 's labor relations director , had assured him that it was not an Official move . Mayor Lindsay said he had directed Harry I. Bronstein , the city 's director of personnel , and Jule M. Sugarman , the Human Resources Administration , " to make every effort to find jobs in the private sector for as many affected people as possible . " He directed Mr. Bronstein and Mr. Haber to meet union leaders . to insure that Civil Service rules and contract requirements would be followed . Lindsay ' Deeply ' Regrets " I deeply regret the very severe pain involved in these layoffs and cutbacks , " Mr. Lindsay said in a statement . ' They seriously affect our capability to govern . " He said he had worked for five years to develop the Urban Action Task Force effort , now handling more than 400,000 citizen problems a , year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural institutions . Yesterday 's order covered 24 actions , with the first extending the job freeze to the Sanitation Department . The sanitation agency had been exempted , from the October job freeze , to let it complete a crash hiring program begun last spring . Next came the closings of the 40 neighborhood Urban Action Task Force offices , begun after riots in low-income areas to focus attention on local needs  --  a closing eliminating 88 jobs . The cancellation of the May 1 hiring of 75 firemen followed an earlier delay in recruitment . Mr. Lindsay next ordered moratorium on new management consultant contracts financed by city tax money . " Thomas Morgan , his press secretary , said this might involve less than $1-million in the expense budget ; of perhaps a $75-million yearly rate in consultant contracts , he said , $68-million was for architects and engineers and the rest for management consultant studies , coming out of borrowing in the capital budget .. The closing of the Department of Cultural Affairs , headed by Dore Schary , is to eliminate 23 jobs and shift five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administrator 's office . Mr. Schary called the action " an absolute ' disaster , " saying : " We no longer have an Urban , crisis ; we have an urban calamity . " The ban on overtime except in the uniformed services or by specific . permission of the Budget Director carried no estimate of savings , but could trim , ' based for pensions of employes ' based on their last year 's gross earnings . The civil defense program is to end 68 jobs , - chiefly inspecting shelters , leaving an Office of Emergency Control supported in part by Federal disaster ' funds . Community Relations Jobs Cut Nine jobs are to be eliminated out . of about 26 in the Department of Public Events , and three out of about nine in the Commission for the United Nations . The program is to eliminate 75 to 100 community relations jobs , with men in such agencies as the Police , Fire and Sanitation Departments being reassigned to other duties . Printing of the Green Book , the city 's official directory , which sells about 50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of all annual reports and newsletters , is to be suspended , unless especially exempted by the Mayor . The Mayor 's Action Center ' is to eliminate 13 out of about 25 jobs and to merge with the Volunteer Coordinating Coundl , which is to drop three of six paid jobs . Two of three shifts for the central complaint office of the Housing and Development Administration are to be dropped to save 20 jobs . Setting a May 1 date for these moves would provide some minor aid for the city 's current budget for the year ending June 30 . That budget faces a deficit of about $350-million out of its originally approved $7.7-billion program . Councilman Theodore Silverman , a Brooklyn Democrat , questioned yesterday how Mayor Lindsay could justify starting a new city agency amid the spending cuts . He raised the issue over the rorthcomlng new . Taxi Commission , whose chairman-designate , Michael J. Lazar , estimated its budget need yesterday as $1.3-million a year , with 120 employes . About 50. employes are to be transferred from the Police Hack Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
