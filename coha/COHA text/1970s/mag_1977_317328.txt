As their Senate hearings began , all of Jimmy Carter 's nominees for the Cabinet seemed certain to receive routine confirmation , but the questions drew comments from the candidates that were anything but commonplace-and touched off an explosion or two . <P> Secretary of State-designate Cyrus Vance admitted that U.S. involvement in Viet Nam had been " a mistake " and that he , as the Pentagon 's No. 2 official in the mid- ' 60s , had made " more than my share of mistakes . " Incoming Labor Secretary F. Ray Marshall revealed that he had urged an economic stimulus package with a much greater emphasis on Government support of jobs than the plan approved by Carter . Fiery Patricia Harris , HUD nominee , rebuked Senator William Proxmire for challenging her qualifications to represent the poor who need housing help . " I am a black woman , " she said , " the daughter of a dining-car waiter . While there may be others who forget what it meant to be excluded from the dining rooms of this very building , Senator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Califano , the prospective HEW Secretary , reaffirmed his opposition to using federal funds to pay for any woman 's abortion . " What you 're saying is that if she is poor and ca n't afford a private abortion , then it 's just tough luck , is n't it ? " asked Oregon Republican Bob Packwood . <P> Whether a woman is " rich or poor , " Califano insisted , " abortion is wrong and federal funds should not be used for providing abortions . " Califano said , however , that he would carry out laws under which about 300,000 abortions a year are financed by the Medicaid program . <P> The only serious controversy revolved around the nomination of Carter 's fellow Georgian and longtime friend , Federal Judge Griffin Bell , to be Attorney General . The N.A.A.C.P. , the Congressional Black Caucus and some liberal Democrats all assailed Bell . Joseph Rauh , vice chairman of Americans for Democratic Action , charged that Bell had given " aid and comfort to segregationists " while an Atlanta attorney , chief of staff to Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal bench . Black Caucus Chairman Parren Mitchell accused Bell of being " the mastermind of Georgia 's massive resistance " to school desegregation when he advised Vandiver from 1959 to 1961 . <P> Bell and his defenders insisted that he had , in fact , been a " moderate " on integration matters in the years when such a role was unpopular in the South . His aim in advising Vandiver , he said , was to keep the public schools open , rather than abandoned ( " Open on a segregated basis , " scoffed the N.A.A.C.P. 'S Clarence Mitchell ) . Bell won a resounding endorsement as being professionally qualified from former Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski . Some Southern blacks also came to his defense . <P> Bell admitted he had made some mistakes as a judge . But times have changed , he said , " and we do have redemption in this country .
