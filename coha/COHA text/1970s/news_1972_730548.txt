txt Sometime in 1973 President Nixon plans to unveil a United States energy policy " fully equal " in significance to his earlier overtures to Peking and Moscow . No presidential initiative , declares Commerce Secretary Peter G. Peterson , will outrank in importance the energy program now being put together in Washington at Mr. Nixon 's command . Mr. Peterson does not say when the policy will be announced but it will be , he promises , " a unified , comprehensive , long-term , and balanced energy strategy " for the United States . Mr. Nixon " could hardly do less , " stressed the commerce chief , " for the energy crisis and the solution we find to it will have an impact on almost every aspect of our domestic and international lives . " The crisis , emphasized Mr. Peterson , is essentially near , although the United States has enough " potential resources of crude oil , natural gas , coal , uranium , and shale oil " to satisfy American energy needs for decades to come . Many problems to solve But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , until a number of technical and environmental problems are solved . Meanwhile , the United States will have to look overseas for oil and gas . " I am told , ' , ' , declared Mr. Peterson , " that the projected U.S. trade deficit in energy could be in the range of $15 billion to $21 billion by 1980 . " The much-touted American-Soviet liquefied gas deal , he cautioned , will swallow billions of dollars of investments and requireyears of , construction work before Russian gas reaches the United States . Oil will form the bulk of U.S. energy imports in the near future , and much of that oil is controlled by Arab states , hostile to American Middle Eastern policy . This , said Mr. Peterson , raises a security dilemma , since excessive reliances on foreign sources could make our military and defense capability vulnerable to embargo . " The danger of supply interruption at the source and the risk of adverse price manipulation are simply too great . . . to warrant wholesale dependence on foreign energy sources . " // UPI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet energy crisis // Security and balance-of-payments factors , in other words are being cranked into the energy program now being mapped for Mr. Nixon by a Cabinet level committee . Compounding the problem is the fact that Japan and the nations of Western Europe also face huge energy deficits , forcing them to compete with the United States ? not only for supplies of oil and gas , but in the sale of exports to pay for energy . Mr. Peterson cites an urgent need for the energy importing nations of the world to develop a policy in concert rather than " engage in a wild and cannibalistic scramble . " He points out that the Soviet Union by contrast to the non-Communist West , " appears to have a remarkably large energy surplus . " Thedeveloping U.S. energy shortage and the Soviet Union 's compelling need to import Western technology to modernize its economy , have been major factors in promoting Washington-Moscow detente . The Commerce Department chief pleads with ecologists and economists to stop talking " past each other " and to analyze realistically their opposing concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fuel penalty of some 30 to 40 percent , " because it takes more crude oil to produce cleaner burning gasoline and more of such gas to run a car . More pollution seen Thus the " other users , from whom that crude oil is diverted , turn to other more polluting fuels such as coal , or the total consumption of crude-oil rises as a result of increased imports , " putting the United States back into a national security bind . Also , said Mr. Peterson , oil from the Middle East , if it continues to be carried in the average size tanker now calling at United States Gulf and Atlantic ports , will make the annual transportation costs 60 percent higher than if supertankers were used . Yet environ- mentalists object to such ships and to the construction of East Coast ports to handle them . Given current technology and current energy consumption , remarked Mr. Peterson , the use of energy in the United States " no matter what its source or how it is consumed , has anti-environmental implications . " Whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peterson finds Americans " too accustomed to our creature comforts " to accept a sharp decline in energy consumption . Problems on the domestic side include cutting down waste in energy consumption ? for example , through better insulation of buildings ? and finding ways of converting cheap coal into energy without damaging the land and polluting the atmosphere .
