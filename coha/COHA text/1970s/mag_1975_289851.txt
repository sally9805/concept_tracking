The pace of the modernization of Nepal is inversely proportional to the number of elephants that have been employed at its three most recent coronation ceremonies . The coronation of King Tribhuvan in 1913-witnessed by only one foreigner , the resident British ambassador-required the services of 109 elephants . The crowning of King Mahendra in 1956 , attended by representatives of 15 of the growing number of nations with which the Himalayan kingdom then exchanged diplomats , required 43 . For last week 's coronation of King Birendra , the streets of Katmandu were aswarm with hundreds of foreign guests representing the some 60 countries with which Nepal now has relations .

But colored lights were strung like necklaces across the trees and temples of the capital , and fountains were brilliantly illuminated . Western hippies , who for years have regarded Katmandu as a kind of real-life Shangrila , were banished for the occasion ; stray dogs were poisoned . <P> On the third morning of the festivities , King Birendra , 29 , who actually took over the world 's last Hindu monarchy three years ago after his father 's death , rose early . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of his body . After a ritual bathing with holy water , he was sprinkled with clarified butter , milk , curd and honey by representatives of the four traditional Hindu castes : a Brahman , a warrior , a merchant and an Untouchable . Only then was Birendra-also known as the King of Kings , the Five Times Godly , the Valorous Warrior , the Divine Emperor and the reincarnation of Vishnu , god of preservation-ready to be crowned . <P> Queenly Beehive .

Then came salutes from the King 's loyal subjects , starting with three-year-old Prince Deependra decked out in a miniature military uniform .
