" HERE STANDS Illinois with the sixth largest coal reserves of any state in the union , " he said . " We have an estimated 150 to 200 billion tons of coal reserves ? a supply that could last for two centuries . Yet , paradoxically , those reserves are not being tapped . " The cause of that paradox is our desire for clean air . Pollution controls have turned us away from the use of Illinois coal . And I want to say loud and clear that I am committed to the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we do not have to give up that progress in order to warm our homes and drive on Sundays .

Tax relief proposals were shelved last year because of the RTA negotiations . Outlining the accomplishments of state government in 1973 , Walker pointed to the RTA accord as historic legislation which should help combat the energy crisis . " At a time when saving every drop of fuel is so important , an RTA could not have been more timely , " he said . Walker also singled out as progressive steps enactment of a new state school aid formula and approval of an extra $200 million for downstate freeways .

" When times are tough  --  and they are  --  Americans do n't sit back and wait for help to arrive . You act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois coal reserves thru a coordinated program is a major step in that direction , he said . " We could use that coal in Chicago , " he said . " We could use it in Peoria , in Madison County , and thruout the state . We could sell it in the energystarved East , which is essentially under the same clean air standards . " Walker said a concerted effort on energy would also mean a shot in the arm for Illinois ' economy . " Increased coal production alone would be a tremendous economic boon to Southern and Central Illinois where our coal reserves are , " he said . WALKER SAID that a state energy:program could help Illinois acquire the Coal Research Center proposed by the federal government  --  a facility to turn coal Into gas for pipeline transmission to users such as public utilities . " This will be a $1 billion project , " he said . " It is of such magnitude that an entire community may have to be built at the site . That means more jobs , more dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its scope and complexity , such a facility is not expected to produce significant energy for at least five years . Later , Sen.
