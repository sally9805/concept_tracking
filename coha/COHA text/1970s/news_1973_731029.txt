txt The President still perceives the contest over the tapes as really a struggle for the presidency ? that his critics were out to get him and that the tapes were only a device to bring about that result . He thinks that now that the tapes have been turned over to the courts his opponents will say that they probably will not be helpful or conclusive , and that they will press for more and more information . Further , he is convinced that both the public and the Congress will be disappointed when they find out that now they really will. , never hear the tapes or see a transcript of what was on them . Key presidential adviser Bryce Harlow underscored this presidential view when he told a group of reporters over breakfast : " You would have found out what was on the tapes if the compromise had been accepted . You wo n't now . " Inadmissible evidence ? The Harlow ? and presidential ? position is that certainly nothing from the tapes will be available to anyone outside Judge John J. Sirica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that Mr. Harlow sees much if not all of the tapes being deemed inadmissible in evidence in subsequent Watergate-related trials . " It 's all behind lock and key now , " says Mr. Harlow of the tapes . " Before you would have gotten the summary , including verbatim transcripts of relevant material . " Mr. Harlow also stressed that the expunging authority given to the President by the appellate court on material he deems to be dangerously sensitive also will come into play now . This , he said , might mean less of the tapes being made available to Judge Sirica than what might have eventually emerged under the plan where Democratic Sen. John C. Stennis of Mississippi would have heard'all the tapes and authenticated the summaries . At most ? or so the administration 's argument goes ? the tape material will only come out in bits and pieces during trials and over an extended period . Mr. Harlow thinks the American public will be angered when it finds it really has lost out on hearing the tapes . // By R. Norman OA athany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstands ' tapes // Members of the House who still are pushing for impeaching the President take exception to this view , however . They contend that if such proceedings take place , the tapes will be made available to the House and , thereby , to the public . The mood of the President today , which will be amplified in his press conference Thursday night , certainly is not conciliatory on the tapes , nor on providing any other further Watergate-related memos or documents . In fact , Mr. Nixon only complied as public pressure against him mounted to the place where he saw that he had no alternative . But in no way does the President concede that  --  the public was right inits judgment of him . Instead , he sees the people 's view as somehow becoming " twisted " by events . And he thinks that by going directly to the public on TV he will be able to clarify what actually happened . The White House will admit to a colossal misjudgment in the impact of the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cox would have resigned , and that he would not stay on and " tough it out " until he was fired . Friendship intact The President understands why Elliot L. Richardson had no alternative but to resign as attorney general after Mr. Cox was dismissed . But Mr. Nixon thought Mr. Cox would leave quietly and that , under those circumstances , both Messrs . Richardson and his deputy , William Ruckelshaus , would have been able to stay on . Both Messrs . Richardson and Ruckelshaus apparently continue to enjoy the friendship and the confidence of the President . Mr. Nixon was fully aware , it seems , of everything these two men now have said publicly , and their utterances in no way are cutting in on his friendly ties with them . The President still views the compromise tape plan , as conceived , to be a masterful one . And his early soundings with members of Congress indicated that it was being well received . " The President thought this thing would float , " says Mr. Harlow .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
