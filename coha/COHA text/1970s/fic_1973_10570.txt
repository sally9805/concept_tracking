Yes , there was literally nothing the Mundy brothers did n't have the inside dope on , including the bombing of Pearl Harbor . That 's what made them so successful .

It was Frenchy 's error in the last game of the ' 42 season ( and the last game ever played in Mundy Park ) , that sent twoRustler runners scampering home in the ninth , and knockedthe Mundys into last . At the time , finishing half a game outof the cellar or right down in it did n't make much difference to his teammates  --  by the end of that first wartime season , allthose old-timers wanted from life was not to have to push theirbones around a baseball field for the next six months .

" Nickname Damur ( TR , BR , 5 ' , 92 lbs. ) could run the ninety feet from home to first in 3.4 seconds , and that was about it . At fourteen he was the youngest player in the majors , as well as the skinniest . The joke was ( or was it a joke ? ) that the Mundy brothers were paying him by the pound ; not that the boy cared anything about money anyway  --  no , all he seemed to think about from the moment he joined the team in spring training , was making a nickname for himself . " How about Hank ? " he asked his new teammates his very first day in the scarlet and white , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He was so green they had to sit him down and explain to him that Hank was the nickname for Henry . " Is that your name , boy  --  Henry ? " " Nope . It 's worse . . . Hey , how about Dutch ?

" But even when lie himself had settled upon the nickname he would n't have minded seeing printed beneath his picture on a bubble gum card , or hearing announced over the lendp101speaker when he stepped up to bat , his teammates refused to address him by it . Mostly , in the beginning , they did not addresshim at all if they could help it , but just sort of pushed him aside to get where they were going , or walked right through him as though he were n't there . A fourteen-year-old kid weighing ninety-two pounds playing in their infield ! " What next ? " they said , spitting on the dugout steps in disgust , " a reindeer or a slit ? " In the meantime , Damur began tugging at his cap every two minutes , hoping they would notice and start calling him Cappy ; he took to talking as though he had been born on a farm , saying " hoss " for horse and calling the infield " the pea patch , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began running out to his position in the oddest damn way  --  " What the hell you doin ' , boy ? " they asked . " That 's just the way I walk , " he replied , " like a duck . " But no one took the hint and called him Ducky or Goose . Nor when he chattered encouragement to the pitcher did they think to nickname him Gabby . " Shut up with that noise , willya ? " cried the pitcher  --  " You 're drivin ' me batty , " and so that was the end of that . Finally , in desperation , he whined , " Jee-zuz ! What about Kid at least ? " " We already got a Kid on this club . Two 's confusin ' . " " But he 's fifty years old and losin ' his teeth ! " cried Damur . " I 'm only fourteen . I am a kid . " " Tough .

" " But whoever heard of a baseball player called Nickname Damur ? " " And whoever heard a ' one that weighed ninety-two pounds and could not endorse a razor blade if they even asked him to ? " Indeed , so slight was he , that on the opening day of the ' 43 season , a base runner barreling into second knocked Nicknameso high and so far that the center-fielder , Roland Agni , came charging in to make a sensational diving two-handed catch of the boy . " Out ! " roared the field umpire , until he re/membered that of course it is the ball not the player that has to be caught , and instantly reversed his decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeing Nickname flying this way and that , and when he came to bat would playfully call out to him , " How about Tarzan ? How about Gargantua ? " and the opposing team had their fun too , needling him from the bench  --  " How about Powerhouse ? How about Hurricane ? How about Hercules , Nickname ? " At last the diminutive secondsackercould n't take any more . " Stop it , " he cried , " stop , please , " and with tears running down his face , pleaded with his tormentors , " My name is Oliver ! " But , alas , it was too late for that . Nickname , obviously , had no business in the majors , not even as a pinch-runner . Oh , he was swift enough , but hardly man enough , and if it was not for the wartime emergency , and the irresponsibility of the Mundy brothers , he would have been home where he belonged , with his long division and his Mom . " How about Homesick ? " the sportswriter Smitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 43 season began , and Nickname , black and blue by now and batting less than his own weight , threw himself in a rage upon the famous columnist . But what began with a flurry of fists ended with the boy sobbing in Smitty 's lap , in a wing chair in a corner of the lobby of the Grand Kakoola Hotel . The next day , Smitty 's column began , " A big league player wept yesterday , cried his heart out like a kid , but only a fool would call him a sissy . .. " Thereafter the fans left off teasing Nickname about his size and his age and his name , and for a while ( until the catastropheat Kakoola ) he became something like a mascot to the crowds . Of course , being babied was the last thing he wanted ( so he thought ) and so under the professional guidance of Big John Baal , he took to the booze , and , soon enough , to consortingwith whores . They called him whatever he wanted them to . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every famous ballplayer 's nickname under the sun  --  all he had to do was ask , and pay . They called him Babe , Nap , Christy , Shoeless , Dizzy , Heinie , Tony , Home Run , Cap , Rip , IIiki , Luke , Pepper , and Trish ; they called biro Cracker and Country and King Kong and Pie ; they even called him I , efty , skinny little funrieen-year old second baseman that he was.  |p103Why  not ? It only cost an extra buck , and it made him feel like somebody important . " Batting in third position , the first baseman , No. 11 , JOHN BAAL . BAAL . " Big John ( TR , BL , 6 ' 4 " , 230 lbs. ) , said never to have hit a homer sober in his life , had played for just about every club in the league , including the Mundys , before returning to them in ' 42 , paroled into the custody of their benevolent manager . Baal joined the club after serving two years on a five-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rookie of the year , and wiped the boy out with a pair of loaded dice . Not the first time John had walked off with somebody else 's World Series earnings , only the first time they caught him with the shaved ivories . In prison Big John had had the two best seasons of his life , earning the ironic appellation ( coined , of course , by Smitty ) " the Babe Ruth of the Big House . " With Big John in the line-up , Sing Sing beat every major prison team in the country , including the powerful Leavenworth club , and went on to capture the criminal baseball championship of America two consecutive seasons after nearly a decade of losing to the big federal pens stocked with hardhittingbootleggers . Inside the prison walls a Johnny Baal did n't have to put up with the rules and regulations that had so hampered him throughout his big league career , particularlythe commandment against taking the field under the influenceof alcohol . If a slugger had a thirst around game time , then his warden saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a robust man might develop ) , because the warden wanted to win . But out in society , you could n't get past the dugout steps without some little old biddy in a baseball uniformsniffing you all over for fear that if you blew on their ball with your sour mash breath , you might pop open the stitching and unravel the yarn . Consequently , aside from his criminal record , the only record Big John held outside of prison was for the longest outs hit in a single season . Christ , he clouted that ball so high that at its zenith it passed clear out of sightas for distance , he just could not get it to go all the way , unless he was pickled.  |p104Now  , every ballplayer has his weakness , and that was Big John 's . If he did n't drink , if he did n't gamble , if he did n't whore and cheat and curse , if he was n't a roughneck , a glutton and a brawler , why he just was n't himself , and his whole damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he had fifteen drinks under his belt , there was nobody like him on first base . Giant that he was , he could still bounce around that infield like a kangaroo when he was good and drunk . And could he hit ! " Why , one time in that jail up there , " Big John told Smitty upon his release from the prison , " I had me a lunch of a case of beer and a bottle of bourbon and got nine for nine in a doubleheader . Yep , everytime I come up , I just poked her into the outside world . But this rule they got out here  --  why it 's disgustin ' ! It ai n't for men , it 's for lollipops and cupcakes ! It 's a damn joke what they done to this game  --  and that there Hall of Fame they got , why , that 's a bigger joke ! Why , if they ever asked me to come up there and gave me one of them poems or whatever it is they give , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say take your poem and wipe your assholes with it , you bunch a ' powder puffs ! " Big John 's contempt for the Hall of Fame ( arid his antisocialconduct generally ) seemed to stem from grievances against Organized Baseball that had been implanted in him by his notorious father , who , in turn , had inherited from his notorious father a downright Neanderthal attitude toward the game . John 's grandfather was , as everyone knows , the Baal , the legendary " Base , " who is still mistakenly credited with the idea of substituting sand-filled bags , or bases , for the posts used to mark off the infield in baseball 's infancy ; in actuality he earned the nickname early in his career because of his behavioron the playing field . If we are to believe the stories , Base Baal played on just about every cornfield and meadow in America before the first leagues were organized , before stadiums were built and men earned a living as players . Like many American boys , he learned the fundamentals in the Army camps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of severalvariants , all of which would be as foreign to the American baseball fan of today as jai alai or lacrosse . This was long before pitchers began to throw overhand , back when the bat was a stick that was narrow at both ends , If . it was not a fencep105post or a barrel stave , back when there would be as many as twenty or thirty players on a team , and when the umpire , chosen from the crowd of spectators , might well be punched in the nose and run off the field if his judgment did not accord with everyone else 's . The ball was a bit larger , something like today 's softball , and " plugging " or " soaking " was the order of the day  --  to get the runner out , you had only to " plug " him ( that is , hit him with the ball while he was between two bases ) , for him to be retired ( as often as not , howling in pain ) . Frequentlya fielder , or " scout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , would wait for the runner to come right up to him , before " plugging " him in the ribs , much to the pleasure of the onlookers . And that was Base 's stock in trade . In fact , when the old fellow finally broke into the newly formed fourclubPatriot League in the eighties  --  by which time the game had taken on many of its modern , more civilized characteristics  --  he apparently " forgot " himself one day and " plugged " a runner heading home from third right in that vulnerable part of a man 's anatomy for which he always aimed . He was instantlymobbed and nearly beaten to death by the other team  --  a bearded giant of a man , close to sixty now  --  all the while crying out , " But that 's out where I come from ! " Base 's son , and Big John 's father , was the infamous pitcher , Spit , who in the years before wetting down the ball was declared illegal , would serve up a pitch so juicy that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself off like a dog come in from romping in the rain . The trouble with Spit 's spitball was , simply , that nobody could hit it out of the infield , if they could even follow the erratic path of that drippingsphere so as to get any wood on it at all . Once it left Spit 's hand , carrying its cargo of liquid , not even he was sure exactly what turns and twists it would take before it landed with a wet thud in the catcher 's glove , or up against his padded body . As opposition mounted to this spitter that Baal had perfected  --  it was unnatural , unsanitary , uncouth , it was ruiningthe competitive element in the game  --  he only shrugged and said , " How am I supposed to do , let ' em hit it out theirselves ? " On hot afternoons , when his salivary glands and his strong right arm were really working , Spit used to like to taunt the opposition a little by motioning for his outfielders top106sit back on their haunches and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he put it , " drownded "  --  the other side . Angry batsmen would snarl at the ump , " Game called on accounta rain ! " after the first of Spit 's spitters did a somersault out in front of the plate and then sort of curled in for a strike at the knees . But Spit himself would pooh-pooh the whole thing , calling down to them , " Come on now , a little wet ai n't gon na hurt you . " " It ai n't the wet , Baal , it 's the stringy stuff . It turns a white man 's stomach . " " Ah , ai n't nothin '  --  just got me a little head cold . Get in there now , and if you cai n't swim , float . " In the beginning , various conservative proposals were offered to transform the spitter back into what it had been before Spit came on the scene . The citrus fruit growers of America suggested that a spitball pitcher should have to suck on half a lemon in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement of vitamin C in the process . They tried to work up public interest in a pitch they called " the sourball , " hut when the pitchers themselves balked , as it were , complaining there was not any room for a lemon what with teeth , tongue , and chewing tobacco in there already , the proposal , mercifully , was dropped . A more serious suggestion had to do with allowing a pitcher to use all the saliva he wanted , but outlawing mucus and phlegm . The theory was that what the ballplayers euphemistically called " the stringy stuff " was precisely what made Baal 's pitch dance the way it did . A committee of managers assigned to study his motion maintained that Spit was very much like a puppeteer yanking on a web of strings , and that the rules had only to be rewritten to forbid a pitcher blowing his nose on the ball , or bringing anything up from back of the last molar for the problem to be solved , not only for the batsman , but for those fans who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the stands . It might even bring more of the ladies out to see a game , for as it stood now , you could not even get a suffragette into the bleachers on a day Baal was pitching , so repugnant was his technique to the fair sex . Even the heartiest of male fans showed signs of squeamishness pocketing a foul tip to bring home as a souvenir to the kiddies . But Spit himself ' only chuckled ( he was a mild , mild man , until they destroyed him ) .  | " When I go to a tea party , I will be all good manners and curtsy goodbye at the door , I can assure you of that . But as I am facin ' two hundred pounds of gristle wavin ' a stick what wants to drive the ball back down my gullet , why then , I will use the wax out of my ears , if I has to . " It was not a remark designed to placate his enemies . In fact , the discovery that he had used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controversy to spread beyond the baseball world ; owners who had come to consider wetting the ball a part of the game and Spit a gifted eccentric who would have his day and pass into obscurity soon enough  --  became alarmed by the outrage of a public that had seemed on the brink of accepting baseball as the American sport , now that it had grown away from the brutish game , marked by maiming and fisticuffs , played by Spit 's Daddy . The editorialists warned , " If baseball can not cleanse itself at once of odious and distasteful ways that reek of the barnyard and the back alley , the American people may well look elsewhere perhaps to the game of tennis , long favored by the French  --  for a nationalpastime . " From all sides the pressure mounted , until at the winter meeting of the Patriot League owners in TriCity , following the World Series of 1902 in which Baal , by his own admission , had waxed a few pitches with some stuff he 'd hooked out of his head , the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball with any bodily secretions for any purpose whatsoever . Inevitable as it is that droplets of perspiration will adhere to a ball in the course of a game , every effort shall be made by the players and the umpire , to keep the ball dry and free of foreign substances at all times . " And with these words baseball entered its maturity , and became the game to which an entire people would give its heart and soul . Spit 's career ended abruptly on the opening day of the 1903 season , when he scandalized the country by an act in such flagrant violation of the laws of human decency , let alone the new resolution passed in Tri-City the previous winter , that he became the first player ever to be banished from baseball  --  the first deplorable exception to the Patriot League 's honorable record . What happened was this : throwing nothing but bone dry pitches , Spit was lagged tot eight , hits and five runs by ap108jeering , caustic Independence team even before he had anyone out in the first inning . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spit was in a rage . They had ruined him , those dryball bastards ! They had passed a law whose purpose was the destruction of no one in the world but himself ! A law against him ! And so before twenty thousand shocked customers  --  includinginnocent children  --  and his own wide-eyed teammates , the once great pitcher , who was washed up anyway , did the unthinkable , the unpardonable , the inexpiable : he dropped the flannel trousers of his uniform to his knees , and proceeded to urinate on the ball , turning it slowly in his hands so as to dampen the entire surface . Then he hitched his trousers back up , and in the way of pitchers , kicked at the ground around the mound with his spikes , churning up , then smoothing down the dirt where he had inadvertently dribbled upon it . To the batter , as frozen in his position as anyone in that ball park , he called , " Here comes the pissball , shithead  --  get ready ! " For years afterward they talked about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only did it make the hairpin turns and somersaults expected of a Baal spitter , but legend has it that it shifted gears four times , halving , then doubling its velocity each fifteen feet it traveled . And in the end , the catcher , in his squat , did not even have to move his glove from where it too was frozen as a target . Gagging , he caught the ball with a squish , right in the center of the strike zone . " Stree-ike ! " Baal called down to the voiceless umpire , and then he turned and walked off the mound and through the dugout and right on out of the park . They banished him only minutes afterward , but ( not unlike the great Gamesh thirty years later ) he was already on the streetcar by then , still wearing his uniform and spikes , and by nightfall he was asleep in a boxcar headed for the Rio Grande , his old stinking glove his pillow and his only pal . When he finally jumped from the train he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Latin Americanbaseball , the hapless Mosquito Coast League of Nicaragua  --  if you could call it a league , where the players drifted from one club to another for no reason other than whist , and entirep109teams were known to disappear from a town between games of a doubleheader , never to be seen again . The Nicaraguan youths that Spit Baal recruited for his league had no local games of their own comparable in complexity and duration , and few were ever really able to maintain concentration through an afternoon of play in that heat . But they accepted without questionthat you could rub anything you wanted on a ball before pitching it , and in fact took to the spitball much the way American children take to the garden hose in summertime . Down in the Mosquito Coast League , Spit 's native boys played just the sort of disgusting , slimy , unhygienic game that his own countrymen had so wholeheartedly rejected by passing the resolution against a wet or a waxed baseball . The few Americanswho drifted to Nicaragua to play were sailors who had jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sane and decent society ; occasionally an unemployed spitballer would come crawling out of the jungle swamp and onto the playing field , in search of a home . Carried from village to village on mules , sleeping in filth with the hogs and the chickens , or in hovels with toothless Indians , these men quickly lost whatever dignity they may once have had as ballplayers and human beings ; and then , to further compromise themselves and the great game of baseball , they took to drinking a wretched sort of raisin wine between innings , which altered the pace of the game immeasurably . But the water tasted of rats and algae , and center field in the dry season in Guatemala is as hot as center field must be in Hell  --  catch nine innings in Nicaragua in the summer , and you 'll drink anything that is n't out-and-out poison . Which is just what the water was . They used it only to bathe their burning feet . Indian women hung around the foul lines , and for a penny in the local currency could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes and pour a bucketful of the fetid stuff over his head when he stepped up to bat . Eventually these waterwomen came to share the benches with the players , who fondled and squeezed them practically at will , and it was not unusual for such a woman to attach herself to a team , and travel with them for a whole season . Because the pitchers  --  whose life was no bed of roses down there  --  rinsed their mouths with raisin wine even while outp110on the mound , going to the jug as often as a civilized pitcher goes to the resin bag , in a matter of innings the ball came to look as though it had been dipped in blood ; the bat too would turn a deep scarlet from contact with the discolored ball and the sticky , sopping uniforms  --  numeraled serapes , really  --  of the players . The clean white stitched ball that is the very emblemof the game as played in our major leagues , was replacedin the Mosquito Coast League with a ball so darkly stained that if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , you might have thought the two teams were playing with a wad of tar or a turd . Into this life Big John Baal was born , the bastard offspringof the only pitcher ever to dare to throw a pissball in a major league ball park , and a half-breed who earned a few coins from the players in the on-deck circle by pouring Central American water over their ears and their ankles . By the time Juanito was two or three seasons old , his father no longer even remembered which of the dozens of waterwomen around the league had mothered his little son  --  to him they all looked the same , dirty , dark , and dumb , but at least they were a step up from the livestock with whom his battery-mate found happiness . A major leaguer had to draw the line somewhere , and Spit drew it at goats . When the child asked him " Mammal Madre l " Spit would n't even bother to wrack his brain ( in that heat wracking your brain could bring on the vertigo ) but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust with the reliever down in the bullpen ( where , on some days , there was even a young snarling bull ) .

John shortly became so adept at connecting with the scarlet spitball ( or spitball , as the disillusioned and drunken expatriates sneeringly called it among themselves ) that by the time he was old enough to leave Nicaragua to go out and take his vengeanceon the world , it was like nothing kw him to lay into a hall that was both white and dry .

Do n't that count for nothing in this country no more ? Gosh damn ! " And here , having baffled and confused everyone involved , having set the fans to roaring with laughter in the stands ( which only burned him up more ) he would go hobbling back behind the plate , and the umpire would call for play to be resumed . After all , not being lawyers by profession , the umpires could not be expected to know if what Hot was saying made any sense , and so rather than get into a legal harangue that might end up in the courtroom with a litigious catcher like this son of a bitch , they preferred to respect his so-called freedom of speech , rather than send him to the showers . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who would  --  a guy with no legs ' ? To Hot 's credit , it should be said that he had as good a throwing arm as any catcher in the league in ' 43 , and he could drill the ball up against the left-field fence when you needed a run driven in ; however , having that leg made out of wood caused him to lurch like something on a pogo stick when he came charging after a bunt , and he was not exactly death on fly balls popped back to the screen behind home plate . His doubles and triples were plentiful , only he was never able to get fartherthan first on them ; and his singles , of course , were outs , the right-fielder , or the center-fielder , or the left-fielder to the first-baseman . ( If you 're scoring , that 's 9 to 3 , 8 to 3 , or 7 to 3 . ) Now obviously , in peacetime a one-legged catcher , like a one-armed outfielder ( such as the Mtmdys had roaming right ) ,  |p113would  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dingiest town in the minors  --  precisely where Hot had played during the many years that the nations of the world lived in harmony .

On the other hand , it is a grisly irony to live on the fringes of the human community . " Batting fifth and playing left field , No. 13 , MIKE RAMA . RAMA . " Even before the Mundys had to play day in and day out on the other fellow 's terrain , Mike " the Ghost " Rama ( TL , BL , 6 ' 1 " , 183 lbs. ) had his troubles with the outfield wall . Just so long as there was one of them behind him , whether it was in Mundy Park or on the road , sooner or later the Ghost went crashing up against it in do-or-die pursuit of a well-tagged ball . In ' 41 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be removed on a stretcher from the field in Port Ruppert . The fans , of course , were deeply moved by a brilliant youngster so dedicated to victory as to be utterly heedless of his own welfare . It rent their hearts to hear the konk resound throughout the ball park when Mike 's head made contact with the stadium wall  --  was he dead this time ? and , damn it , had he dropped the ball ? But miraculously neither was the case . The umpire who rushed to the outfield to call the play ( before calling the hospital ) invariably found the baseball lodged snugly in the pocket of the unconscious left-fielder 's glove . " Out ! " he would shout , and without irony , for he was describing only the status of the batter . Hurray , cried the fans  --  whereupon the bullpen catcher and the batboy would come dashing onto the field to lift the crumpled hero from the grass on to the stretcher , and thence to the ambulance that could already be heard wailing across Port Ruppert to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . . . Once the solemnity of the moment had passed the fans did have to wonder if perhaps Mike was n't a little short on brainpower to be knocking himself out like this every couple of weeks ; for it was n't as though he misjudged the proximityp114of the wall in his effort to catch the ball , but rather that he seemed completely to forget that such things as walls even existed . He just could not seem to get the idea of a barrier into his head , even after bringing the two into forceful conjunction . Why they came to call him the Ghost was because he appeared to think  --  if that is the word for it  --  that what was impenetrable to the rest of us would be as nothing to him : either he did not believe that walls were really walls , or flesh only flesh , or he just was never going to get over having been born and raised in Texas . For down there , where he had been a great high school star , it seemed they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . just laid out the bases and let the boys roam like the longhorns . In Mike 's rookie year , Mister Fairsmith would make it his business to be at the hospital first thing in the morning to fetch the Mundy left-fielder once the doctors had put the pieces back together and proclaimed him ready to have another go at life . They would drive directly from the hospital to Mundy Park , where the two would walk out across the manicured diamond on to the outfield grass . With only the groundskeeperslooking up from their rakes to watch the oddly touching scene , Mister Fairsmith would lead the rookie all the way from the left-field corner to Glorious Mundy 's headstone in furthest center , and then back again . They might walk to and fro like this for half an hour at a stretch , Mike , under Mister Fairsmith 's direction , running the tips of his fingers along the wall so as to prove to himself that it was no figment of anybody 's imagination . " Michael , " Mister Fairsmith would say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind when you act like this ' ? Do you have any ideal " " Sure . Nothin ' . I 'm thankin ' about catchin ' the ball , that 's all . I ai n't havin ' no sex thoughts or nothin ' , Mister Fairsmith , I swear . " " Michael , I am cognizant of the fact that there were no walls surrounding the ball fields in the part of the world where you grew up , but surely , lad , you had walls in your house when you were a boy down there . Or am I mistaken ? " " Oh sure we had walls . We wuz poor , but we wuz n't that poor . "  | " And did you , as a child , go running into the walls in your house ? " " Nope , nope . But then a ' course I was n't chasin ' nothin ' then . " " Son , you are going to be held together by clothesline and baling wire before you are even twenty-one , if you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly ball may be your last . " " Gee , I sure hope not , Mister Fairsmith . I live for basehall . I eat , drink , and sleep baseball . It 's just about the only thang I ever thank about , is baseball . I see pop flies in my dreams . I ca n't even sleep sometimes , imaginin ' all the differentkinds of line drives there are to catch . Baseball is my whole life , I swear . " " And your death too , lad , if you do n't start in this minute thinking about the reality of the wall . " But nothing anyone could say was able to implant in Mike Rama a healthy respect for the immovable and the unyielding . To the contrary , as some men are drawn to wine and some to women , so Mike Rama was drawn to that left-field wall . If he could be said to have had a temptress , that was it . " Why , I 'll tell you what I think , " said Johnny Baal to Smitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mike ' ud marry her . " Batting sixth and playing third base , No. 2 , WAYNE HEKET . HEKET . " Kid Heket ( TR , BR , 6 ' , 172 lbs. ) , the oldest Mundy of them all , the oldest major leaguer of ' them all , a rookie in 1909 and a utility infielder and pinch-runner thereafter , he had become a regular only after the Mundy brothers had sold everybody of value on the great championship team , and just about everything else that was any good in the dugout " exveldin ' , " as the Kid told it , " me and the water cooler . " Of course he was no longer " so fleet afeet , " as he 'd been in his pinch-running days , but then , as the aging third-sacker asked , " Who is ' ? " Were his reflexes gone , would he say ? " I sure would , " replied the Kid . And his eyesight ? " Dim durin ' the day , practically nil at night . Nolte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His strength ? He sighed : " Oh , gone with the wind ,  |p116Smitty  . Call me broken down and I wo n't argue . " Why did he stay on in baseball then ? " What else is there  --  ? This here is just about all that I am fit to do now , and , as you see , I ai n't fit for it . " Fortunately , playing for the wartime Mundys was not really as taxing physically as a job on a farm or a factory might have been for a man of fifty-two . And , during the wintermonths the Kid could just sit around down home resting up in the barber shop , enjoying the smell of the witch hazel , the warmth of the stove , and the pictures in the old magazines . During the season itself , in order to conserve what little energy he had , he just played as close as he could to the thirdbaseline , hoping in this way to cut down the extra-base hits , but otherwise granting to the opposition whatever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I see it now , if a feller hits it to my left , he got hisself a single and more power to him . If a ' course the Frenchman wants to try and get it , well , that 's his business and I do n't propose to interfere . His ways is his ways and mine is mine . As I gets older I find myself gettin ' more philosophical . I got to ask myself , you see , who am I to say what should be a base hit and what should n't , a feller with but four years of schoolin ' in his whole life . No , some old folks may do otherwise , but I do n't propose to set Wayne Heket up as some kind of judge of others at this late stage of the game . " By which he meant the game of life , clearly , for even if it was only the bottom of the first , he paid no mind to what was hit between third and short . " At my age you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You just got to give up somethin ' , so I give up goin ' to my left . Let 's be honest , Smitty , my runnin ' days is over , and there ai n't no sense in actin ' like they ai n't . " When the Mundys came to bat , the Kid always made it his business to catch a quick nap  --  no sooner did his seat hit the bench but he was out like a light . " That 's what I credit my long baseball life to , you know . Them naps . So long as I can catch me some shuteye in that dugout there , there is no doubt that I am a better man for it back on the playing field . A ' course , as you can imagine , nobody cherishes more than me them times that we get a little rally goin ' , and I can really slip off into dreamland . There is no doubt about it  --  and I tolep117Mister Fairsmith , right out , too  --  if we was a better hittin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The worst for me is when the fellers start swingin ' at them first pitches . What in hell 's the hurry , I ask ' em , where 's the fire anyhoo ? Sometimes my stiff of bones has barely stopped throbbin ' with pain , when they are shakin ' my shoulder , tellin ' me it 's time to go back on out to the field . Best of all was the other day in Aceldama . It was top of the eighth and I was near to droppin ' , let me tell you . I was up first , struck out lookin '  --  or not lookin ' , I suppose  --  comeback to the bench , expectin ' that of the old forty winks I 'd be gettin ' myself maybe four , if I was lucky . Well , what happens , but that whole darn bunch of hitless wonders catches fire and we do n't go out until they have batted all the way around to me . What a snooze I had ! Like a top ! Unfortunately , the Butchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inning to beat us  --  but if I had not had that good long nap while we was up , I tell you , I might not have made it all t he way through them seven runs of theirs on my feet . As it was , I dozed off a couple times in the field , but then I usually does , when we is changin ' pitchers . Tell you the truth , I thought they had scored only four and we was still ahead by one . I did n't find out till the next mornin ' when I seen it in the paper down in the lobby that we lost . Must be then that I was out on my feet for three of them runs  --  not that it makes muchdifference . You been around as long as me , you seen one run , you seen ' em all . That afternoon , when I run into some of the hitchers on the streetcar goin ' out to the ball park , I asked t hem how come they did n't wake me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third . You do n't find that kind of considerationevery day , you know , especially from the other team , which is usually tryin ' to hair-ass you , one way or another . I joked ' em  --  I said , What ever got in to you boys , bein ' so quiet and all comin ' round the bag ? Do n't want to rouse the sleepin ' beast or somethin ' ? ' And you know what they tole me ? I could n't believe it . They tole me they come whoopin ' round that bag , each and ever one of ' em , squawkin ' their heads off like a bunch of crows , and I did n't budge one inch . Well , that 'll give you a idea of just how tired a feller can get bein ' in baseball all his life . Maybe that is what it is like bein ' in anything all your life , but I can only speak for myself , youp118know . And I 'm just shot . Why , if this here terrible war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the regular line-up like this , why , I would n't be surprised if one afternoon I will just drop off , you know , and that 's that . The other fellers ' 11 come runnin ' back in to the bench when the innin ' is over and it 's our turn to bat , but not me . I 'll just be left stooped over out there , with my hands on my knees and a jaw full of tobacco juice , waitin ' for the next pitch , only I 'll be dead . Well , I only hope it do n't happenwhile the game is in progress , ' cause if the other team finds out , they sure as hell will start droppin ' them bunts in down the third-base line . Now , even alive I ai n't hardly the man with a bunt I was back before the First World War . But with me dead with rigor mortis , and Hothead havin ' only one leg , they could just about bunt us crazy , do n't you think ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventh and playing right field , No. 17 , BUD PARUSHA . PARUSHA . " Bud Parusha ( TR , BR , 6 ' 3 " , 215 lbs. ) was the youngest of the Parusha brothers , two of whom , Angelo and Tony , were allstaroutfielders for the Tri-City Tycoons , and until they entered the service boasted the two strongest throwing arms in the majors . A throwing arm no less powerful and accurate was said to belong to the third brother , who surely would have been a Tycoon outfielder too , if it were n't that the throwing arm was the only arm he 'd been born with . It was as though Mother Nature  --  or , to be realistic about it , Mother Parushahavinglavished such gifts upon Angelo and Tony , had run out of steam by the time she got to Bud , and when it came to finishing him off , could not deliver up anything whatsoever , not even a stump , where the mate to the throwing arm should have been . Consequently , when Angelo and Tony went off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could as a waiter in his father 's restaurant in Bayonne . Then came the war . Angelo and Tony were commissioned and placed in charge of the hand grenade training program for the entire United States Marine Corps , and Bud found himself elevated to the big leagues , not up to the Tycoons of course- they were the P. League champs after all -- -hut across the Jersey marshes ,  |p119to  the team that seemed rapidly to be becoming a haven for the handicapped . Bud moved in with Hothead Ptah , whose averages in the minors he had followed for years in the back pages of The Sporting News , and rumor had it that the two would shortly be joined by a one-eyed pitcher from the Blues , a Jewish fellow called Seymour Clops , nicknamed inevitably , " Sy . " " What about a sword-swallower and a tattooed man , while they 're at it ! " cried Hothead , who did not at all cotton to the idea of being a freak in a freakshow . " And what about dwarfs ! There must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait to get up some morning and look over and find I am roomingwith a left-handed dwarf , all curled up and sleepin ' in my mitt . And a Jew on top of it ! " The dwarf , of course , when he came , would be right-handed and a Christian , the pitcher O.K. Ockatur . For those who never saw Bud Parusha in action during the war years  --  and after him , Pete Gray , the one-armed outfielderwho played for the St. Louis Browns  --  it will be necessary to explain in some little detail , how , and to what degree , Ile was able to overcome his handicap on the field . First off , to catch an ordinary fly ball was no more problemfor Bud than for any fielder of major league caliber ; however , in that he wore his glove on the end of his throwing arm , it did require an unorthodox maneuver for him to return the ball to the infield . Unlike Gray of the Brownies , who had a stump of a left arm under which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pocket , Bud ( with no left arm at all ) had to use his mouth . He was lucky to have a large one- " that old law of compensation , " said the sports announcers  --  anda strong bite which he had further developed over he years by five minutes of chewing on a tennis ball before going to sleep each night . After fielding a ball , he was able instantly to remove it from his glove with his teeth , and hold it clamped between them while he shook the glove from his hand ; f hen he extracted the ball from his mouth with his bare right hind , and hurled it with Parusha-like speed and accuracy to the infield . All this lie accomplished in one fluid , unbroken motion and with such efficiency and even grace , that you would have thought that this was the way the outfield was supposed to be played.  |p120In  the beginning the fans did not know quite what to make of Bud 's singular fielding technique and there were those who laughed at the man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth to something through the orifice in his head . There were even those in the bleachers  --  there always are  --  who like children popping out of closets would shout " Boo ! " , hoping in that way to startle Bud and cause him to swallow the baseball . Unfortunately there were occasions when in his anxiety not to drop the ball out of his mouth while flinging off his glove , he would take it too far back between his molars , and find himself unable to extricate it unassisted . It happened infrequently , but always in the same tense situation : with the bases loaded . And each time with the same disastrousresult : an inside-the-mouth grand-slam home run . RolandAgni would race over from center and Nickname would tear out from second to try to save the day , but not even those two together , performing the play as they had practiced it  --  Agni kneeling on Bud 's chest , forcing open his jaws like a fellow about to stick his head into the mouth of a crocodile , and young Damur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ball for all he was worth  --  were able to prevent the four runs from scoring . Despite his difficulties  --  and , in part , because of them kindly , uncomplaining Bud became popular as Hothead , who had been there first , had never even tried to be . While the sluggers and fancy clans were paid to endorse razor blades and hair oil , Bud 's beautifully formed signature soon came to adorn the pages of medical magazines , where he was pictured in his gray road uniform with the scarlet piping and insignia , sitting in a wheelchair , or balancing himself on a crutch . Where it was feasible , he would always test a product before giving it his endorsement  --  more than most of his colleagues bothered to do for items far less compromising to a ballplayer 's prestige than oxygen tents and artificial limbs . And when the Mundys had a free day on the road , he never failed to go off to visit the local veterans hospital , where he would promise one of the amputees to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything good . He could not dedicate home runs to them , because big as lie was he really could not be expected to hit home runs with only one arm , but every six orp121seven times at bat , he managed to smack a single , and then from the loud speaker there would be the announcement that Bud 's hit had been " for " so-and-so in such-and-such a hospital , and the fans would smile and clap . Around the league he began to build a real following among the handicapped of all ages ; sometimes as many as forty or fifty of them would be out there in the stands along the right-field line when the Mundys and Bud came to town . The public address system had only to announce Bud 's number for them to begin banging on the railings with their canes and crutches . " Parusha 's Clinic " Smitty dubbed the right-field stands , and in Kakoola and Tri-City they even set up ramps out there to make things easier for the handicapped who turned out to see Bud perform . In their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try , for instance , to touch him with the tip of a crutch as he came near the stands to field a foul , endangering his three remaining limbs , not to mention his eyesight . Once a woman in a wheelchair attempted to lean forward to pluck Bud 's cap off for a souvenir and tumbled out of the stands onto his back . But mostly they were content to just sit there and take heart from the courage and ingenuity that Bud displayed ; in Kakoola , in fact , one fan was so inspired by Bud 's example that after ten years in a wheelchair , he found himself up on his feet cheering wildly as Buddy made a diving shoestring catch in the bottom of the ninth . It was in a column about this very fellow that Smitty coined the name " Parusha 's Clinic . " " I 'm walking ! " the roan suddenly cried out , even as Bud was extracting the ball from his mouth to fire it to first to double off the Reaper runner and end the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to its readers that night  --  hut then could not resist the sardonic subheadTWO MIRACLES IN ONE DAY " Batting eighth for the Mundys , and playing center field , No. 6 , ii:OLANI ) AtaNI . AGNI. "  |p122Roland  Agni ( TL , BL , 6 ' 3 " , 190 Pos. ) , in ' 43 a kid of eighteen tapering like the V for Victory from his broad shoulders and well-muscled arms down to ankles as elegantly turned as Betty Gable's -- swift on his feet as Nickname Damur , strong as a Johnny Baal , as mad for baseball as Mike Rama , and in his own baby-blue eyes destined to be the most spectacular rookie since Joltin ' Joe . One difference : the Yankee Clipper , aside from being four years older than Agni when he entered the majors , had also played a few seasons down in the minors ; what was so amazing about Roland , Roland thought , was that he was leaping right from high school to the big time . Only there was a catch . Upon his graduation the previousJune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports from colleges all around the nation , and offers from twenty-three major league clubs in order to be signed up by his father with the Ruppert Mundys , the only team in the three leagues that had not even bothered to scout him . It was precisely their indifference that had convinced Mr. Agni that the Mundys were the major league team for his son , if major league team there had to be . Not that Mr. Agni , like some fathers , had ally objection to baseball as a career ; the problem was Roland 's pride , which , in a word , was overweening . The boy had been hearing applause in his ears ever since he had hurled a perfect sandlot game at age six , with the result that over the years he had become , in his father 's opinion , contemptuous of everything and everyone around him , above all of his family and the values of humility and self-sacrifice that they had tried , in vain , to instill in him . When his father dared to criticize him for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner table , screaming in his high-pitched adolescent voice that he could n't help it , he was superior . " But , " asked his mother , using psychology , " do you want the girls to go around whispering that Roland Agni is stuck on himself ? " " They can whisper whatever they want  --  they 'd be stuck on themselves too , if they was inc ! " " But nobody likes a self-centered person , darling , who thinks only of himself . " " Oh do n't they ? What about the forty colleges begging me to enroll there ? What about the twenty-three major league teams pleading with me to play ball for them ? "  | " Oh but they do n't want you for your character , Roland , or for your mind  --  they want you only for your body . " " Well , they should , because that 's what 's so great about me ! That 's what makes me so phenomenal ! " " Roland ! " " But it 's true ! I got the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whole world ! " " Go Go to your room , Roland !

" " Well , shame on him , flattering you that way just so they could sign you up ! As if you are n't conceited enough ! Oh , " cried Mrs. Agni , turning to her husband , " what is going to happen to him out in the real world  --  ? How will he ever survive the hardships and cruelty of life with such an attitude ? Roland , tell me , whatever made you think you were such a hero at seventeen years of age ? " " MY BATTING AVERAGE ! " screamed the star , his voice echoing off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened politely to the twenty-three fasttalkingmajor league scouts as each tried to outbid the otherfor his son 's services , and then telephoned the Mundy frontoffice in Port Ruppert to announce that the father of the phenomenalRoland Agni was on the line . " Come again ? " saidthe voice at the other end  --  " the phenomenal who ? " No responsecould have been more heartening to the boy wonder'sdad . He gave the Mundy front office a brief account of Roland'shigh school career : in four years of varsity play he hadhatted .732 and regularly hurled shutouts when he was n't inthe outfield robbing the other team of extra-base hits . However , Mr. Agni rushed to say , if hired to play for the Ruppertlundys , his son was to receive no more than the lowest paidmember of the team , was to bat eighth in the line-up in his firstyear , and to rise no more than one notch in the batting order ineach succeeding year . It would be more than enough for a boyas self-centered as Roland to leap from high school directly to the majors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bargain . These , said Mr. Agni , were his only conditions . " Look , " laughed the Mundys ' man in Port Ruppert ,  | " what about i ( ' we go you one better and do n't pay him at all . " Mr. Agni leaped at the suggestion . " In other words , I would just continue to give him his allowance  --  i " " Right . And of course his room , board , and supplies . " " In other words , he 'd be playing for a professional team but still have his amateur status . " " Correct . Of course , we 'd need a deposit from you right off , so 's we can keep the eighth slot in the batting order open for him . And room and board we 'd have to have in advance . You can understand that . " " Fine . Fine . " " All right , you 're on . Now what 's that name again ? Angry ? " " Agni . " " First name ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 1 , Asbury Park , New Jersey on account of the war . Be cheaper for you anyway than Florida . We 'll hold the eighth spot for him until noon that day . " " Thank you . Thank you very much . " " Well , thank you , Mr. Angry , and thanks for calling the Mundys , " said the fellow , with a chuckle , and hung up , believing that he had just indulged a practical joker , or perhaps a sportswriter having some fun at the expense of the Mundy front office . Maybe even a fella name a ' Smitty . To find himself in the P. League with the Ruppert Mundys , and batting eighth in their line-up  --  and not even getting paid for it  --  had something like the humbling effect upon their boy that the Agnis had hoped for . Still , crushed and bewilderedas he was by this bizarre turn of events , Roland Agni led the league in batting that year with .362 , in hits with 188 , in home runs with 39 , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him , he hardly scored , unless he hit the ball out of the park , or stole second , third , and then home ; after getting on with a hit he was generally cut down at second on a d.p. or left stranded as the pitcher went out on strikes . And given the eight who batted before him he had no chance of doing much of anything in the r.b.i. department . In the middle of the season he was called for his Armyp125physical and found unfit for service . First the Mundys , now 4F ! It took a team of physicians a whole morning to study his marvelous V-shaped physique , whispering all the while among themselves  --  in admiration , thought the innocent center-fielder  --  before arriving at their decision . " Okay , Roland , " they asked , slumping wearily to the floor of the examination room after the three-hour ordeal , " what is it ? Trick knee ? Bad ticker ? Night sweats ? Nosebleeds ? Sciatica ? " " What do you mean ? " " What 's wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say ? " " Wrong with met Nothin ' ! Just look , " he cried , standing to show himself off in the nude , " I 'm perfect . " " Listen , Roland , " said the doctors , " there 's a war on , in case you have n't heard . A world war . What happens to be at stake is n't eighth place in the Patriot League but the future of civilizationitself . We 're doctors , Roland , and we have a responsibility . We do n't want somebody going into a battle that may turn the tide of history , suddenly coming down with a sick headache and just lying down on the job in the trench . We do n't want the lives of an entire platoon endangered just because somebody like you has to stop to scratch his pruritus ani . " " But I do n't get sick headaches , or the other thing either .

Smell my breath  --  it 's like fresh-cut hay ! " But when he blew his sweet odor into their nostrils , it only further infuriated the doctors . " Look here , Agni  --  we want to know what the hell is wrong with you , and we want to know now . Constipation ? Sinusitis ? Double vision ? Get the shakes , do you ? Hot flushes ? Or is it the chills , Roland ? How about epilepsy , does that ring a bell ? " they asked , slamming him up against the white tile wall to have another go at him with their stethoscopes . " No ! No ! I tell you , I never been sick in my life ! Sometimes I even think I am impregnable ! And that ai n't a boast  --  it 's a fact ! " " Oh it is , is it ? Then how come according to our records here you are the only unpaid professional athletein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to keep you on the team , rather than the other way around ? How come an impregnable boy like you is n't up with the Tycoons ,  |p126Roland  ? " " That 's what I want to know ! " cried Agni , and collapsed onto the examination stool , where he sat weeping into his hands . They let him sob until it appeared he had no more resistance left in him . Then they stole upon him where he sat unclothed and gorgeous , and softly stroking his golden curls , whispered into his ear , " Wet the bed ? Sleep with a night light ? How come a big strong handsome boy like you , leading the league in base hits and doubles , is still batting eighth for Ruppert , Roland ? Do n't you like girls ? " " Daddy , " Roland shouted into the phone when he was dressed again and back out in the world , " I am unfit for the service now too ! I am 4F  --  ONLY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ME ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " BUT THE DOCTORS COULD N'T FIND ANYTHING , NOT EVEN THE THREE OF THEM TOGETHER ! " " Well , doctors are n't perfect , anymore than the rest of us . That 's the very point I am trying to make to you . " " But I should be 1A , not 4F ! And not a Ruppert Mundy , either ! Oh , Daddy , what am I doing on that team , where everybody is some kind of crackpot , thinking all the time about his name , or running into the walls , or having to have me sit on his chest to pull the darn baseball out of his mouth ! " " In other words , what you are telling me , Roland , is that you are too good for them . " " It ai n't sayin ' you are too good if you just happen to have all your arms and can stay awake for nine innings ! " " In other words then , you 're just better ' than everybody else . " " On this team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't occur to you that perhaps your teammateshave had hardships in their lives about which you know nothing . Do you ever think that perhaps why you 're better ' is because you were fortunate enough to have all the opportunities in life that they were denied ? " " Sure I think about it ! I thank my lucky stars about it ! And that 's why I do n't belong with them , even if I was batting first and gettin ' a million dollars ! " " Oh , son , what are we going to do with you , and this nnquenchablethirst for ran le and glory ? "  | " Trade me ! Trade me away from these freaks and these oddballs ! Daddy , they ai n't even got a home park that 's their own what kind of major league ball club is that ? " " You mean for the great Roland Agnito be playing with ? " " For anybody to be playin ' with  --  but me especially ! Daddy , I am leading the league in batting in my rookie year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was twenty-two ! " " And yet you 're 4F . Does n't that mean anything to you at all ? " " No ! No ! Nothin ' means nothin ' anymore ! " " Batting in ninth position and pitching for the Ruppert Mun-dys ... " The Mundy council of elders : starters Tuminikar , Buchis , Volos , and Demeter ; relievers Pollux , Mertzeger , and the tiny Mexican right-hander , Chico Mecoatl  --  every last one of them flabby in the middle , arthritic in the shoulder , bald on the top . " The hairless wonders , " said Jolly Cholly Tuminikar , who had discovered the fine art of self-effacement following the tragedy that destroyed his confidence and his career , " and a good thing too . Ai n't a one of us could raise his arm to comb his hairs if he had any . Why , if I go three innings on a windy day , I got to use my other hand the next morning to wipe myself . Do n't print that , Smitty , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might-have-beens , should-have-begins , would-have-beens , never-weres and never-will-bes , Tuminikar and his venerable cohorts managed nonetheless to somehow get the ball the sixty feet and six inches to the plate , which was all the rule book required of them . The ball , to be sure , occasionally arrived on a bounce , or moved so slowly and with so little English on it that the patrons back of home plate would pretend to be readingGeneral Oakhart 's signature off the horsehide all the while the pitch was in transit . " What time you say she 's due in ? " they 'd ask , holding up their pocket watches , and on and on , comically , in that vein . There was even one of them , Chico Mecoat1 , who on occasion tossed the ball in underhand . " How about if ' he fungoes ' em , ( Chico , then you wo n't have to throw at all ! " the sadistic hecklers called , heedless of the pain thatp128caused Chico to resort sometimes to a style of pitching that had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffalo and the Indian . The fans who needled the wretched Mexican were not so plentiful actually as their vociferousness might make it appear . Most people seemed to find it eerie , rather than amusing or irritating , to watch him work in relief . Invariably it was dusk when Chico , the last bald man in the bullpen , would trudge across the darkening field to pitch for the Mundys , already brutally beaten with an inning or two of punishment still to come . By this hour , the hometown fans , filled to the gills on all the slugging they 'd seen , would have begun to leave their seats , tugging their collars up against the cool breeze and smiling when they peered for a final time out at the scoreboard to what looked now like the score of a football game . Two , three touchdownsfor the home team ; a field goal for the visitors , if that .. . So , they would converge upon the exits , a swarm of big two-fisted creatures as drowsy with contentment as the babe whose face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , victory . Ah , triumph . How it does mellow the bearded sex ! What are the consolations of philosophy or the affirmationsof religion beside an afternoon 's rich meal of doubles , triples , and home runs ? . . . But then came Chico out to the mound , and made that little yelp of his as he tossed his single warm-up pitch in the general direction of Hothead 's mitt , that little bleat of pain that passed from between his lips whenever he had to raise his arm above his waist to throw the ball . The fans , clustered now in the dark apertures that opened on to the ramps leading down to the city streets , would swing around upon hearing Chico 's bleat , one head craning above the other , to try to catch a glimpse of the pitcher with the sorest arm in the game . For there was no one who had a motion quite like Chico 's : in order to release the ball with a minimal amount of suffering , he did not so much throw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion . It looked as though he might be trying to pass his hand through a hoop of flames without gettingit burned  --  and it sounded as though he was n't quite able to make it . " Eeeep ! " he would cry , and there would be the ball , floating softly through the dusk at its own sweet pace ,  |p129and  then the solid retort of the bat , and all the base runners scampering for home . Probably the fans themselves could not have explained what exactly it was that held them there sometimes five and ten minutes on end watching Chico suffer so . It was not pity  --  Chico could quit and go back to Mexico if he wanted , and do down there whatever it was Mexicans did . Nor was it affection ; he was , after all , a spic , closer even to a nigger than the Frenchman , Astarte . Nor was it amusement , for after three hours of watching the Mundys on what even for them was an off day , you did n't have the strength to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfixed , perhaps for the first time in their lives , by the strangeness of things , the wondrous strangenessof things , by all that is beyond the pale and just does not seem to belong in this otherwise cozy and familiar world of ours . With the sun all but down and the far corners of the stadium vanishing , that noise he made might have originated in the swaying jungle foliage or in some dark pocket of the moon for the sense of fear and wonder that it awakened in men who only a moment earlier had been anticipating their slippers and their favorite chair , a bottle of beer and the lovely memoriesthey would have forever after of all those runners they 'd seen galloping around third that afternoon . " Hear it  --  ? " a father whispered to his young son . " Uh-huh , " said the little boy , shifting on his little stick legs . " Hear that ? It can give you the goose bumps . Chico Mecoatl  --  you can tell your grandchildrenyou heard him make that noise . Hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So home they went ( home , to their homes ! ) , leaving Chico , who hardly ever got anybody out anymore , to fill the bases two times over , and the relentless home team to clear them two times over , before , mercifully , the sun set , the field disappeared , and the disaster being played out now for the sake of no one , was called on account of darkness.  |p132FINAL  STANDINGS 1943W L PCT GB Tri-City Tycoons 90 64 .584Aceldama Butchers 89 65 .578 1Independence Blues 88 66 .571 2Terra Incognita Rustlers 82 72 .532 8Tri-City Greenbacks 79 75 .513 11Asylum Keepers 77 77 .500 13Kakoola Reapers 77 77 .500 13Ruppert Mundys 34 120 .221 56p133Containing a description of how it is to have your home away from home instead of having it at home like everybody else . Mister Fairsmith informs the team of the moral and spiritualbenefits that can accrue from wretchedness . With predictablecynicism , Big John elucidates the advantages of homelessness . Frenchy forgets where he is . An insinuating incident in which a man dressed like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digression on the Negro Patriot League , the famous owner of the league , and a brief description of some fans , containing a scene which will surprise many who believe Branch Rickey the first major league owner courageous enough to invite colored players into organized baseball . The Mundys arouse the maternal instinct in three Kakoola spinsters and succumb to their wiles with no fight at all . Big John and Nicknamevisit the pink-'n-blue-light district , wherein Nickname gets what he is looking for , thus concluding the visit to Kakoola , in which city the Mundys will suffer more than the humiliation of their manliness before the downfall is complete . The Mundys are followed on a swing around the league and the particular manner in which they are intimidated in each of the league cities is described , including the train ride in and out of Port Ruppert , which , though short , may draw tears from some eyes . A victory for the Mundys in Asylum turns into another defeat , containing , for the curious , a somewhat detailedaccount of baseball as it is played by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never felthimself a stranger in his own land , may pick up some ideaof what it is like . SWINGING AROUND THE LEAGUE for the first time in 1943 , the Mundys were honored on the day of their arrival in each of the six P. League cities with a parade down the main commercial thoroughfare and a pregame ceremony welcoming them to the ball park . Because of war shortages , the vehicle which picked thew up at the train station was , as often as not , borrowed forp134the hour from the municipal sanitation department . The twenty-five Mundys , having changed into their gray " away " uniforms on the train , and carrying their street clothes in suitcases or paper bags , would climb aboard to be driven from the station down the boulevard to their hotel , while over the loudspeaker fixed to the truck came the voice and guitar of Gene Autry doing his rendition of " Home on the Range . " The record had been selected by General Oakhart 's secretary , not only because the words to the song seemed to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he President Roosevelt 's very own favorite , and would thus strengthen the idea that the fate of the Mundys and of the republic were inextricablybound together . Weary to death of the whole sordid affair , General Oakhart consented , for all that he would have been happier with something time-honored and to the point like " Take Me Out to the Ballgame . " Though it had been hoped that people in the streets would join in singing , most of the pedestrians did not even seem to realize what was going on when a city garbage truck drove past bearing the team that had finished last in the league the previous year . Of course , the tots out shopping with their mothers grew excited at the sound of approaching music , expecting , in their innocence , that they were about to see Santa or the Easter bunny ; but excitement quickly faded and in some instances even turned to fear when the truck appeared , jammed full of men , most of them old and bald , waving their baseball caps around in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me a home where the buffalo roam , Where the deer and the antelope play , Where seldom is heard a discouraging word , And the skies are not cloudy all day . Judging from the racket they made , it could n't be said that the Mundys were unwilling to give it the old college try , at least at the outset . Obviously a refuse van ( as Mister Fairsmith preferred to call it ) was not their idea of splendor anymore than it is yours or mine ; still , scrubbed clean , more or less , and tricked up with red , white , and blue bunting , it was not really as had as Hothead could make it sound when he started iii , as per usual ,  |p135being  outraged . " Why , it looks to me like they are carting us off to the city dump ! It looks to me as if they are about to flush us down the bowl ! " cried Hot . " It looks to me like a violation of the worst sort there is of our inalienable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independenceto all men including Ruppert Mundys ! " Yet , as the Mundys knew better than anyone in the game , there was a war on , and you had to make do with the makeshift for a while . It just did not help to complain . And hopefully , said Jolly Cholly T. , hopefully the more they sacrificed , the sooner the war would be over and they would be home  --  and not home on the range either , but back in New Jersey , where they had been beloved and where they belonged . Around the league the city officials were of course free to welcome the Mundys with a speech of their own composition ; invariably , however , they chose to follow to the letter the text that had been composed for the pregame ceremony by General Oakhart 's office , which also supplied the papier-macho " key to the city " that was awarded at home plate to Mister Fairsmith , in behalf of the local fans . " Welcome Ruppert Mundys , " the speech began , " welcome to , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAUSE " appeared in the prepared speech , capitalized and tucked between parentheses . Though the officials always correctly inserted the name of their fair city in the blank provided , they repeatedly read into the microphoneat home plate the parenthetical direction intended to allow time for the fans to rise to their feet to applaud , if they should be so inclined . Fortunately nobody in the ball park ever seemed to notice this error ; either they took the word for an electronic vibration coming over the p.a. system , or they were n't paying that much attention to the dronings of the nameless functionary in a double-breasted suit and pointed black shoes who had been dispatched by the mayor to take his place at the ceremonies . All the fans cared about was the ball game , and seeing the Mundys clobbered by the hometown boys . The Mundys , on the other hand , had become so accustomed to the ritual , that when , midway through the first road trip , a Kakoola city official neglected to make " PAUSE " the twelfth word in his welcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ptah , accused the city of Ka/koola of deliberately treating them as inferiors because they happened to be a homeless team . In point of fact , by actually pausing in his speech rather than just saying " PAUSE , " Bridge and Tunnel Commissioner Vincent J. Efghi ( brother to Boss Efghi , the mayor ) , had managed to evoke a ripple of applause from the crowd ; nothing thunderous , mind you , but at least a response somewhat more sympathetic than the Mundys had received in those cities where the address was delivered by the local ward heeler , parenthetical instructions and all . After the game that day , with Hot and his disciples still riled up , Mister Fairsmith decided to hold a meeting in the Mundy locker room , and give the team their first sermon of the season on the subject of suffering ; for the first time since they had hit the road , he attempted to instruct them in the Larger Meaning of the experience that had befallen them , and to place their travail within the context of human history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as they were playing their baseball games on the road , American boys were bleeding to death in jungles halfway around the globe , and being blown to bits in the vast , uninhabited skies . He told them of the agony of those who had been crushed beneath the boot heel of the enemy , those millions upon millions who had lost not just a home in the world , but all freedom , all dignity , all hope . He told them of the volcanic eruptions that had drowned entire cities in rivers of fire in ancient times , and described to them earthquakes that had opened up beneath the world , delivering everything and everyone there was , like so much mail , into the churning bowels of the earth ; then he reminded them of the sufferings of Our Lord . By comparison to such misery as mankind had known since the beginnings of time , what did it matter if the Bridge and Tunnel Commissionerof bridgeless and tunnellers Kakoola had neglected to read even half the welcoming speech to the Mundys ? Solemn as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was very solemn indeed  --  Mister Fairsmith asked what was to become of them in the long hot months ahead , if they could not bear up beneath the tiny burden that they had had to shoulder thus far ? What if they should have to partake of such sufferingsas was the daily bread of the wretched of the wretched ofp137the earth ? " Gentlemen , if it is the Lord 's will , " he told them , " that you should wander homeless through this league , then I say leave off disputing with the Lord , and instead seize the opportunity He has thrust upon you to be strong , to be steadfast  --  tobe saved . " " Horse shit ! " snorted Hothead , after Mister Fairsmith had passed from the locker room in meaningful silence . " Ah , forget it , Gimp , " said Big John Baal . " It is only a word they left out of that speech there , you know . I mean it ai n't exactly a sawbuck , or even two bits . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word , why it do n't mean a thing that I could ever see . A whole speech is just a bunch of words from beginning to end , you know , that did n't fool nobody yet what 's got half a brain in his head . Ai n't that right , Damur ? " he said , tossing his jock in the face of the fourteen-year-old whose guardian and protector he 'd become . " A nose by any other name would smell as much sweat , ai n't that so , nino 2 You fellers care too much about what folks say . Do n't listen is my advice . " " You do n't get it , Baal , " snarled Hot . " You never do . Sure it starts with only a word . But how it ends is with them doin ' whatever they damn well please , and kicking all your dreams down the drain . " " Hot , " said John , leering suggestively , " maybe you is dreamin ' about the wrong sort of things . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights like last licks the wrong thing ? " " Aww , " said Big John , " it 's only a game , for Christ 's sake . I 'm tellin ' ya : it do n't mean nothin ' . " " To you nothin ' means nothin ' . " " Worryin ' over shit like justice ' do n't , I 'll tell you that much . I just do like I want anyway . " " Justice ai n't shit ! " Hot told him . " What they are doin ' to us ai n't fair ! " " Well , like Ulysses S. tole you boys , that 's good for you that it ai n't fair . That 's gon na make champs out of you , if not in this here season , then in the next . Wait 'll next year , boys ! Haw ! Haw ! " Here he took a slug out of the liniment bottle that sat at the bottom of his locker . " You want me to tell you boys soniethin ' ? This twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to you , if you only had the sense to know it . What do you care that you do n't have a home and the hometown fans that go with it ? What the hell is hometownfans but a bunch of dodos who all live in the same place and think that if we win that 's good for ' em and if we lose it ai n't ? And then we ai n't none of us from that there town to begin with  --  why , it could just as easy say PORT SHITHOLE across your uniform as the name of the place you only happen to be in by accident anyway . Ai n't that so ? Why , I even used to pretend like that 's what it did say , years ago , instead of RUPPERT . I 'd look down at my shirt and I 'd say to myself , Hey , Jawn , ai n't you lucky to be playin ' for PORT SHITHOLEand the glory of the SHITHOLE fans . Boy , Jawn , you sure do want to do your best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SHITHOLE name . ' You damn fools , " he said , " you ai n't from Rupe-it ! You never was and you never would be , not if you played there a million years . You are just a bunch of baseball players whose asses got bought up by one place instead of the other . Come on , use your damn heads , boys  --  you were visitors there just like you are visitors here . You are makin ' there be a difference where there ai n't . " The Mundys went off to the shower in a silence that bespokemuch confusion . First there had been Hothead to tell them that the word dropped from the welcoming speech was only the overture to the slights , insults , and humiliations that were to be visited upon them in the months to come . Then there was Mister Fairsmith to warn them that slights and insults were n't the half of it  --  they were shortly to begin to partake of the suffering that was the daily bread not just of the wretched of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Big John informing them that the Rupe-it rootas , for whom they had all begun to long with a feeling more intense than any was even willing to admit , had been some sort of mirage or delusion . Of course , that the son of Spit and the grandson of Base should speak with such contempt for their old hometown hardly came as a surprise to any of his teammates ; having been raised in the sordid netherworld of Nicaraguanbaseball , he no more knew the meaning of " loyalty " than of " justice " or " pride " or " fair play . " Still , on the heels of Hothead 's warning and Mister Fairsniith 's apocalyp/tic prophecy , it was not reassuring to be told that the place to which you longed to return had never been " yours " to begin with . " Well , " cried Mike Rama , over the noise of the shower , " if we ai n't never been from Rupe-it , then the Reapers ai n't from Kakoola , either . Or the Rustlers from Terra Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere ! " " Right ! " cried Nickname . " They 's as worse off as we is ! " " Only then how come , " said old Kid Heket , toweling himself down , " how come the Kakoolas is here in Kakoola and we ai n't there in Rupe-it , or goin ' back there all season long ? How come instead of headin ' back to Jersey , we are off to Independence and then all around the league to here again , and so on and so forth for a hundred and fifty-four games ? " " But what 's the difference , Wayne , " said Nickname , who was continually torn between parroting Big John , whose blasphemous nature had a strong hold upon a fourteen-yearoldaway from home for the first time in his life , and siding as any rookie would with the rest of the players against the Mundy renegade  --  " so so what if we ai n't goin ' back there ? It 's more fun this way anyway . Stayin ' in all them hotels , eatin ' hamburgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby ! And all them waitresses in them tight white un-eeforms  --  wheee ! " " Nickname my lad , soon you will discover that it ai n't fun ' either way , " said the old-timer , " it 's only less confusin ' , that 's all , wakin ' up and knowin ' where you are instead of where you ai n't . " So , not much happier than when they went off to the shower , they returned to the locker room , there to be consrontedby Frenchy , standing fully dressed before his locker , though not in his baggy brown suit and beret . No , the Frenchmanwas off in never-never land again . Half a dozen times already this season , one or another of the Mundys had come upon Frenchy making faces at himself in the washroom mirror , a grown roan in need of a shave doing what little kids do when they want to look like something out of Charlie Chan jutting his upper teeth out over his lower lip and holding back the flesh at the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his teammate would shout , to wake him out of the trance he was in . " Hey , number one son ! " and , caught in the traitorous act , Frenchy would run to hide in a toilet stall . What a character ! Them foreigners ! But now it was not funny faces he was making in the mirror ; no , nothing funny about this at all . There was Frenchy , dressed in the creamy white flannel uniform that none of them had worn all year , the Mundy home uniform , with the faint red chalk stripe and RUPPERT scrawled in scarlet across the chest , the final " t " ending in a flourish nearly as grand as John Hancock 's . And what was so sad about it was how splendidhe looked . The Mundys were stunned  --  so accustomed had they become to seeing one another in the drab gray " away " uniforms , they had nearly forgotten how stylish they used to be . No wonder they were beloved by the Rupe-it rootas , even in the worst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season before ! " Hey , whatcha doin ' , Frenchman , " asked Jolly Cholly , " kel sort of joke is this anyway , chair of pall Ai n't today been rough enough ? Aw Christ , somebody , what 's the French for knock it off 2 " " Geem , " replied Frenchy , whose English was incomprehensible to his teammates , except occasionally to Chico , who would pass on to Big John , the other Spanish-speaking Mundy , what he believed to be the general drift of Frenchy 's zees and zoos  --  " geem zee wan , ooh zee was zow , zen ah geem zee , ah zee ull ! " And he began to beat his skull against the door of his locker . As best anyone could figure , coming back into the empty locker room from the shower , Frenchy had momentarily forgottenwhere he was , and begun to dress as though for the second game of a doubleheader back in Ruppert . . . " Crazy Canadian Frog , " said Big John , " he still thinks it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us the old heave-ho . Hey , Ass-start , do n't lose your head over it , " chuckledBig John while Cholly and Bud Parusha struggled to keep the shortstop from destroying himself , " look what they done to my daddy . And he did n't go around beatin ' his brains out . Hell , he just figured it all out  --  and then passed it on to me . The wisdom of the ages , Ass-start : it 's all shit . You jerk-offs take it too serious . "  |p141Here  there was a noise at the clubhouse door , the timid peck of a tender knuckle , and then the quivering voice of a little lady inquiring as to whether the Mundys were " decent " . . . But before narrating what next took place in Kakoola on May 5 , 1943  --  a day that seems in retrospect to stand as the dividing line between the Mundy past and the Mundy future , between the Patriot League as it once had been and the Patriot League as it was to become in the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Frank Mazuma , the innovative owner of the Reapers , had declared that afternoon " Ladies Day , " hoping thus to beef up the skimpy crowd that would otherwise turn out to see the two lowliest P. League teams falling all over each other in their effort to lose . Play , in fact , had been interrupted in the top of the fifth when it was discovered that one of the ladies who had been admitted free of charge was in actuality a man . In a close-fitting dress of flamboyantdesign , all dolled up in a blond Hollywood wig , and swinging a gaudy handbag and hips , she had given herself away by making a brilliant one-handed stab on a near-miss home run lifted foul into the left-field seats by Big John , who , being perfectly sober , had swung late . At first the crowd got a bang out of the remarkable feat performed by the sexy gal , and stamped and hollered like a crowd at the burlesque show ; then , in the next instant , realizing that no woman , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a catch like that bare-handed , they began to converge upon the blond bombshell , piercing wolf whistles mixed with obscene threats . When police whistles joined in , the blond rushed down to the edge of the stands and with her dress parachuting up to her pink garters , leaped to the grass . Quickly she disposed of Rudra , the Kakoola left-fielder , with a stiff-arm block that sent him sprawling , and started for second . The Mundys , convincedby now that this was some sort of " half-time " entertainmentcooked up by Frank Mazuma , had to join in laughing with the crowd when she sidestepped the charging Kakoola keystone combination ( who wound up in one another 's arms ) and made for the pitcher 's mound in those high-heeled , toeless shoes . Big John was still at the plate with his 0 and 2 count when the blond , swinging her purse at the Kakoola pitcher 's head , drove him from the hill with his arms around his ears.  |p142Then  , the purse still in her right hand , and the foul ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back  --  whew-whew ! those garters again !  --  and threw the Mundy power hitter the biggest damn curve he 'd seen in a decade . Christ , did John get a boot out of that ! " A big-titted slit in a little-bitty dress , and she just struck me out ! Haw ! Haw ! With stuff like that , just think what the rest of her looks like ! " Next the blond broke for the Mundy dugout , throwing the boys big kisses as she headed their way . Oh brother . The visiting players were shrugging and grinning at one another and so hardly took seriously the cops charging after her , shouting , " Mundys , stop her ! She ai n't no lady ! Stop her , boys  --  she 's under arrest for pretending to be what she ai n't ! " Even when the police yanked their pistols from their holsters and drew a bead on the blond 's behind , the Mundys just shook their heads , and , pretending to be stroking their whiskers , hid their titters behind their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mister Fairsmith 's mouth  --  and was down through the dugout and gone . They could hear her heels ringing on the concrete runway to the clubhouse . " Stop ! " cried the cops , dashing right on after her . Then bang ! Oh my God . They had opened fire on her fanny . No one ( except maybe Mazuma ) knew what next to expect . Would the blond come back on out to take a bow , waving her wig at the crowd ? Or would the cops come up out of the clubhousedragging her " corpse " behind them ? And what about her blood , would it be ketchup or real ? But all that happened next was that the game was resumed , an 0 and 2 count on Johnny Baal and the Mundys down by six . . . and the folks in the stands feverish with speculation . You should have heard the ideas they came up with . Some even began to wonder if maybe a real live homo had n't got loose on the ball field . " Yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the boys with the green eyeshades who had been predicting the downfall of the game ever since the introduction of the lively ball , " I tole you  --  you start in foolin ' with this here thing , and you start in foolin ' with that one , and next thing you know , you got the cupcakes on your hands . You wait , you see  --  Ladies Day ' is only the beginnin ' . They 'll be havin " Fairy Day ' around the league before this thing is over.  |p143Yessir  , every la-dee-da window-dresser in town will be out here in his girdle , and they 'll be givin ' away free nail polish to them fellers , so-called , at the door . Oh , it 's acomin ' , do n't worry about that . It 's all acomin ' , every last damn thing you can think of that 's rotten and dumb , on accounta they just could not leave the damn ball alone like it was ! " Among the sportswriters , speculation took a less pessimisticif no less bizarre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who could out-bizarre you any day of the week . Those who had gotten a good look at the blond 's sidearm delivery , and followed closely the course of that cruel curve , swore that the " lady " on the mound had been none other than Gil Gamesh done up in falsies and a dress  --  that 's right , the big bad boy of yore , hired for the day as a female impersonator by Frank M. But Frank , who wore a black eyepatch ( over the right eye one day , over the left the next ) so as to look even more like the pirate he was , only clapped himself on the knee and said , " Hell , now why did n't I think of that ! " " You mean , Frank , you are asking us to believe that you had nothing to do with those shameful shenanigans out there today ? " " Smitty , I only wish I had . Whoever could stage a spectacle like that is just the kind of crowd-pleasing genius I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to tell you that I think what happened there in the top of the fifth was something staged by the greatest crowd-pleaser of ' em all : fella name a ' God . " Oh , there was little that Frank Mazuma would not say , or worse , do . Only the season before he had gotten the bright idea of turning the Reapers into the first colored team in OrganizedBaseball  --  yes , selling off all the white boys and bringing niggers in to replace them ! As things stood in those days days which must now seem as remote as the age of the Pharaohs to those who search in vain for a white face on the diamond when All-Star time comes around  --  the bigwigs of the national pastime understood that it was in the best interestsof the game  --  and if of the game , the country ; and if of the country , mankind itself  --  for the big leagues to be composed entirely of white men , with an occasional Indian , or Hawaiian , or Jew thrown in for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own , hundreds of them barnstormingaround the country wherever colored roll : were looking forp144a little Sunday entertainment ; they even had their own " major " leagues , the Negro National , the Negro American , and the Negro Patriot League , composed of teams who made their homes in the real major league cities , and who were allowed to play in the big league parks when the white teams were out of town . Oftentimes these colored teams performed for Sunday crowds substantially larger than those that paid to see the white major league team play ball , and that , of course , was what most intrigued Frank Mazuma , and encouragedhim to think along the lines of becoming the Abe Lincoln of big league ball . What fans those colored boys had ! Why , they would travel hundreds of miles , make overnight journeys in wagons drawn by mules and nags , to get to the ball park for a Sunday doubleheaderbetween the Kakoola Boll Weevils and their first divisionrivals , the Ruppert Rastuses , or the champs playing out of Aceldama , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shoes , they 'd just come straight on out of the fields Saturday at quitting time , along the dusty country roads and on to the highways , walking all night long so as to reach the bubbling asphalt of the city by high noon of the next day . Batting practice was usually just getting underway , when they emerged at last into those great coliseums raised by white men and white money and white might . Beneaththeir feet the cool concrete of the stadium runways was like soothing waters . ( Yeah ! ) And that green pasture was greener than anything they knew , this side of the fields of heaven . ( Yeah ! ) Oh , up , up went the sky-high stadium , up so high that those pennants seemed to be snappin ' around God 's very throne . ( Yeah ! ) Oh them colorful flags , they might have been the fringes of His Robe ! Yes suh , de Big Leagues ! ( Or , to be precise , a Negro facsimile of same . ) The owner of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to Americans primarily because of her picture on the flapjack box . With the fortune Aunt Jemima had amassed from the use of her name and her face on the pancake mix , she had managed to buy up one colored team after another in P. League towns , until she had organized the circuit and made it equal in status to the other two Negro " major " leagues . Of course , everywhere she went , she had that bigp145smile full of white teeth shining out of her face , and she waxed her skin so it shone just as it did in her portrait on the box , and she was never without that checkered bandanna that made her look so cheery and sweet  --  but when it came to a business deal , she was a match for Mazuma himself ; her name notwithstanding , she was nobody 's aunt . Aunt Jemima was always up in Kakoola on Sundays to watch her favorites , the Boll Weevils , take on whichever colored club was visiting with them that week ; invariably she was accompanied by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Washington Deesey , who year in and year out tap-danced the National Anthem from atop a bass drum set down on home plate the day the colored World Series opened . Other famous Negroes of the time who were frequentvisitors to Aunt Jemima 's box were the comedy duo " Teeth ' n Eyes , " who were always seeing g-g-g-ghosts in horror movies , and would amuse the crowd at the ball park with their famous blood-curdling howl when a d-d-d-dangerous hitter came to the p-p-p-plate ; and Li ' 1 Ruby , the twittering maid of the airwaves , who had won America 's heart with her ridiculous crying jags , and who arrived at the ball park riding sidesaddle on her great Dane , a strapping eighteen-year-old lad imported from Copenhagen , said to be something more than a means of transportation for the actress ; " Now ai n't that a surprise ! " the fans would exclaim , when they saw the diamonds roped around her wrists and her ankles , " I thought she was a little bitty thing ! " Yet another Boll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lover , the distinguished tragedian whose portrayal of the loyal old slave who saves his master 's drowning child and subsequently dies of pneumoniain the Civil War epic Look Away , Look Away had earned him an Academy Award for the best supporting actor , Mr. Mel E. F. Lewis . And then over the years there were the numerous boxing champions who were like sons to Aunt Jemima : those who come immediately to mind are Kid Licorice , Kid Bituminous , Kid Smoke , Kid Crow , Kid Hershey , Kid Midnight , Kid Ink and his twin Kid Quink , Kid Tophat , Kid Coffee , Kid Mud , and of course , the champ , Kid Gloves , whose twenty-year reign as middleweight champion of the world ended in 19.45 when lie disowned fame , fortune , andp146country to become a worker in an aluminum factory in the Soviet Union . A moody and solitary man , he had always disdainedthe glitter of Aunt Jemima 's box and instead preferred to sit on the bleacher benches in deep center , surrounded by barefoot children who clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang the songs of the Third International . In 1948 , in a speech from the center of the prizefight ring in Madison Square Garden , he infuriated Americans of all hues by denouncing the country that had made him a hero , and the following day he left by steamer for Murmansk . Only weeks after his departure , news leaked from behind the Iron Curtain ( how , no one knew , given that the curtain was iron ) that the great Gloves had been exiled to Siberia for murderingwith one blow  --  ironically enough , said the gloating tabloids , a left  --  a Commie foreman , who , in his impatience with the new comrade unable to speak the mother tongue , had called him by the one English word he had picked up from the American G.I.s in the war . According to " highly authoritative " reports released some years later by the U.S. State Department , in the Siberian labor camp poor Kid Gloves had been cruelly teased and tormented by prisoners and guards alike , until finally , in that far-off land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utopian dream perishedof homesickness , in his final days languishing for the American prizefight ring as did his forebears in Georgia for the jungle villages of the Ivory Coast . Now , in order to scout the colored players he planned to poach from Aunt Jemima 's league , Frank Mazuma purchased from a pawnshop a frayed clerical collar and a second-hand black suit , painted himself with burnt cork , and , wearing beneath his derby a woolly gray wig , went out one Sunday in 1942 to see the Boll Weevils take on the Independence Field Hands in a doubleheader in his own Reaper stadium . Needless to say , Mazuma had no intention of " buying " these black boys like so many slaves  --  he would just dangle the big leagues before the best of them , and leave it to them to decide whether they wished to continue to play for peanuts for the colored version of the big leagues , or to run off to play for peanuts for the real thing . So as to be privy to the inside dope on the star colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Jemima . Clever operator that she was , she instantlypenetrated his disguise , but said nothing , choosing rather to pass that scandalous information directly to General Oakhart the next day . Let him handle the thief  --  it was n't for Aunt Jemima to admonish a white man with Mazuma 's kind of money . . . " Well , " she said , welcoming the clergyman with her biggest , shiningest smile , " howdydo , Reverend ! Ai n't we honored though ! " Mazuma bowed and presented her with a card from his tattered billfold . It read : PARDON MEI AM A NEGRO DEAF MUTE MINISTERI SELL THIS CARD FOR A LIVING-MAY GODBLESS YOU . . But we stray from the story of the Mundys on the road . Suffice it to say that foolish and trivial as the events of that day may appear from the perspective of today , it nonethelesswould appear that the death knell for the white man 's game  --  and if for the white man 's game , for a white man 's country ; and if for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knell 's first faint tinkle was heard at the moment that Frank Mazuma , in that preposterous disguise , handed his outlandish business card to the famed " mammy " off the flapjackbox at a doubleheader between the Boll Weevils and the Wield Hands , with Teeth ' n Eyes , Li'l Ruby , and Washington I ) eesey looking on . . . Impossible , you may say . More than impossible  --  outrageous , to suggest that a greedy scoundrel like Mazuma in circumstances so ludicrous as these , initiated what was eventually to become the greatest advancement for 1 he colored people to take place in America since the EmancipationProclamation . But of course you must remember , fans , I he turning points in our history are not always so grand as they are cracked up to be in the murals on your post office wall . We return to that , knock on the door of the visitors ' clubhouse , where the dazed and troubled Mundys are still gathered , following the 14  --  3 " Ladies Day " loss to Kakoola , and all thatp148had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A woman giggled . " Are  --  are you decent , boys ? " All but Frenchy were unclothed and dripping still from the shower , but Big John replied , " Oh sure , we 're decent all right . And what about you , honey ? Or is your name funny ' ? " " That voice ! It 's Big John ! " " Big John ! " " Big John ! " " My , my , " said Big John , his eyes darkening with desire , " there 's three of ' em . . . Hey , who all are you girls , whatcha after , or can I take a guess ? " Now the three spoke in unison : " We 're the Mundy Mommys ! " " The who ? " asked John , laughing . " The Mundy Mothers ! " " The Mundy Moms ! " " And , " asked Big John , " just how old would such a Momma happen to be ? Twenty-one or twenty-two ? " They giggled with delight . " Fifty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John ! " " Seventy-one years young , John ! " Baal pushed the door open a crack  --  " If she 's fifty-four , " he whispered to his mates , " Wayne here is a infant . Thanks , ladies , " he called , " but we do n't need none . " The other players had by now scrambled into their street clothes , and converging upon the door , peered out from behind the first-baseman at the three elderly ladies , wrinkled little walnuts in identical hats , shoes , and spectacles . " Howdy , " said Jolly Cholly , stepping into the hallway . " Now what can we do for you ladies ? " " It 's Jolly Cholly ! " the women cried . " Oh , look ! It 's Hothead ! It 's Chico ! It 's Deacon ! It 's Roland ! " And then the three were talking all at once  --  " Oh Oh you poor Mundys ! You poor boys ! How you must miss your sisters and your wives ! Who sews your buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sees after your heels and your soles ? Who takes care of you , always away from your home  --  ? " " Oh , " said Jolly ( ' holly , with a kindly smile , " we managep149okay , more or less . It ai n't so bad missin ' a few buttons now and then . There 's a war on , you know . " " But who feeds Frenchy his toast and his fries ? Who looks after Bud to see he brushes his teeth after games ? And Chico , with the sorest arm in the league  --  and nobody to cut his meat ! " " Oh , " said Cholly , " do n't you worry about Chico , he just sort of picks it up by the bone you know , with the other hand , and  --  and , look here , this is nice of you and all , but ai n't you ladies from Kakoola anyway ? How come you ai n't sewin ' buttonson for the Reapers over there , and Lein ' Moms to them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried , triumphantly . " Well , we do n't neither , ladies , " said Jolly Cholly . We 're a big league club , you know , so of course thanks for the offer , very kind of you and all . " And yet within the hour the Mundys were marching h rough the darkening streets of Kakoola behind their selfappointed " Moms , " each of the players obediently calling out the kind of home-baked pie he would like as the grand finale to his home-cooked meal . So what if it did n't accord with their " dignity "  --  so what if Roland Agni turned up his prima dnnna nose and refused to join in ? Let Agni go back to brood In that lonely hotel ! They might be a homeless ball team , but t Ira t did n't mean they had to do without their just desserts ! I l l , if they were doomed the way Mister Fairsmith said they %v ere , they would be doing without everything soon enough . Wayne " Apple ! " " Bud ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banana ! " " Mike ? " Rhubarb , peach , chocolate cream  --  " " Big John ? " " Ilair ! " and , laughing , he ducked down a dark alleyway , dragging Nickname with him . " Hey , . J ; 1WU --  - what about my pie ? " " You miss your niouuu ; i , In you , Nickname ? " well , no. "  | " Is that why you was cryin ' when she started in talkin ' about sewin ' on buttons ? " " I was n't cryin ' , I got some shit in my eye , that 's all . " " Come on , boy , you was bawlin ' like a babe ! She started in talkin ' about darnin ' socks , and you wuz about knee-deep in tears . " " Well , " admitted the second-baseman , " I am homesick , a little . " " Haw ! Haw ! Sick for home are you ? Miss your mom , do your " " Oh Jawn , do n't kid with me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , " he said , with a sob . " Well , vino , then that 's what we are going to get youeverythin ' ! Just like it used to be for you , boy , back in the good old days ! " And so they set out across Kakoola , Big John telling his protege , " In a town like this , Nickname , there ai n't nothin ' money ca n't buy . And if they ai n't sellin ' it here , they are sellin ' it in Asylum  --  and if they ai n't sellin ' it in Asylum , there is always good old Terra Inc. down at the end of the line . Hell , a ballplayer could spend a lifetime roamin ' this league , and never lack for entertainment  --  if , primp , you know what I mean by entertainment , and secondo , what I mean by a ballplayer ! Haw ! Haw ! " he roared , reaching for Nickname 's little handful . " Come on , muchacho , I 'll get you mothered all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plies the trade ! " Oh , did Nickname 's heart start in pounding then ! A whorehouse , he thought , his very first ! What Ohio youngster 's heart would n't be pounding ! But when they finally stopped running they were on a street that looked just like the streets where all the nice familieslived in the movies he used to see on Saturdays back home . " Hey , John , " he whispered , " this is the wrong place . Ai n't it ? Look at them houses . Look at them white fences and them green lawns . " " Yeah  --  and look up there at them street signs . This is it , Nickname . You heard of Broadway and 42nd Street . You heard of Hollywood and Vine . Well , this is the world-famous corner of Tigris and Euphrates . This is the world-renowned ' Cradle of Civilization . ' "  | " What 's that ? " " Haw ! Haw ! Why , first time I ever heard of it , I guess I was only a lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sailor off the Great Lakes . He was a shortstop for my paw , till he got the d.t.s and we traded him to a Guatemala farmer for a mule . He says , I been everywhere , I been to Shanghai , Rangoon , Bangkok , and the rest , I been to Bali and back  --  but what they got right up there in Kakoola , Wisconsin , U.S.A. , ai n't like nothin ' in the whole wide wicked world for fixin ' what ails you . ' " Dragging Nickname with him , he started up the walk to 6 Euphrates Drive , which like numbers 2 through 20 , was a white house with green shutters and a water sprinkler turning on the well-kept lawn . John righted a tricycle overturned on the steps and rang t he chimes . " Hey , " whispered Nickname , " some kid lives here . " " Kee-rect . And his name is you . " A little peephole opened in the door . " Whattayawant ? " " Say I 'm home , Mom , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Jawn ! " " That do n't matter . Say it . It 's like Joe sent me , ' that 's all . " " Awww  --  " But into the peephole , Nickname said , " Okay -I 'm home . " " Mom ' " said Johnny Baal . " Okay ! Mom , ' " whispered Nickname , and the door swung open just as doors do when the magic words are spoken in fairy tales  --  and there was a woman looking nothing at all like what Nickname had had in mind . She wore no rouge , smoked no cigarettes , leered no leers . Oh , she was pretty inough , he supposed , and young too  --  but what the hell was she doing in a blue apron with yellow flowers on it ' ? And holding an infant in her arms ! Instead of winking , or wiggling her hips , she smiled sweetly and said , " Why , my little . . . " " Nickname , " whispered Big John . " Nicholas ? " " Nickname @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right on the nose , cntie , " said Big John.  | " Oh , Nickname , " she said , leaning forward to kiss his cheek , " let me just put sister to bed . Oh , you must be so hungry and tired from playing all day with your friends ! How you must need your little bath ! " Nickname made a face . " I just had a shower , " he said to John . " Down the stadium . " " Well , now you 're goin ' to get a nice , warm soapy bath . " " Awww , Jawn ! " " Come , darling , " said the woman and she turned and started up to the second floor , crooning to the tot in her arms as she mounted the stairs . " Is she the one we do it to ? " whispered Nickname . " Nope , " said Big John , leading the boy over the threshold . " She 's the one what does it to you . " " Does what2 And why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place like this ? " " And what 's wrong with this place , nino2 This here is as cozy as you can get . " Sure enough , he could not complain about the accommodations . They were standing in a living room that had two big easy chairs pulled up to the fireplace , a sofa covered in chintz and plump with pillows , and hanging on every wall paintings of bowls of flowers . There was also a playpen in the center of the large round hooked rug . Stepping easily over the bars , Big John sat down among the stuffed animals . " Take your choice , " he said , holding an animal in either hand , " the panda or the quack-quack ? Well , what are you waitin ' for , Nickname ? Hop in , much-acho . " " Come on , Jawn . I ai n't fourteen months  --  I 'm fourteen years . I 'm a big leaguer ! " " Hey a rattle ! Ketch ! " " But I'rn second-baseman for the Ruppert Mundys ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red ! Ding-aling ! Make way , here comes the fire department ! " " Aww , Jawn , you 're makin ' fun of me , I think . " " Hey , here she comes now get in here , you ! " Reluctantly Nickname obeyed . He 'd rather be iii therewith John than out on the rug with the woman with the apronand the apron strings.  | " Ah , there 's my darling little boy ! " she chirped . " There 's my ... " " Nickname , " announced Nickname . " Nickname Damur , second-baseman , lady , for the Ruppert Mundys . In case you ai n't heard . " " And all ready for his bath too , my little second-baseman ! " Lovingly , she extended her two bare arms over the side of the playpen . " Come now , darling . Mommy 's going to clean you and oil you , and then she 's going to put you in your nice jammies and feed you and read to you and put you to beddybye  --  isn'tthat going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Watch it , lady , I would n't come no closer with that kind a ' talk ! " " Bastante , you little bastard , " said John , " all she wants to do is take care of you . All she wants to do is give you all the comforts of home . Ai n't this what all you big leaguers is pissin ' and moanin ' about ? Ai n't this what all that clubhouse croakin ' is about ? Now cut the shit , Nickname , this here is costin ' me fifteen smackers ! You know what I could get for that kind of dough in this town ? Three different redhot nigger gals all at the same time ! " " Let 's go get ' em then , John  --  let 's get ' em , and split ' ern ! " " You kiddie ' me , nino ? I 'm talkin ' about jungle pussy , boy , what 's got fire in her belly ! Now you just travel up them stairs , sonny and do as your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your little quack-quack . Now git ! " So the second-baseman climbed out of the playpen and balefully followed his " mom " up to a bathroom whose wallpaperwas a gay design of clowns and trumpets . There he was undressed and bathed , toweled down , powdered , diapered , and encased in a pair of pale-blue Doctor Dentons , with booties to cover his feet . Though he had long dreamed of being naked with a woman , all he felt while she kneeled on the floor beside the tub and cleaned the insides of his ears , was a desire to knock her down and run . And it did n't help any having Big . lolin in the doorway making wisecracks , and reaching out with his toe to lift her dress and admire her behind . " Now , " said the " mow , " " for your little hot dog . "  | " Hey , that there looks like fun ! " roared John , as she soaped between Nickname 's legs . " Only it ai n't , " moaned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pea soup and applesauce , spoon-fed him by his " mom "  --  " Awwww , John ! " " Eat it , Nickname  --  it 's costin ' fifteen smackers ! "  --  and then he was released from his high chair and led up by the hand to his room , where she read to him the story of Little Red Riding Hood ( " What a big pair you got too , Momma ! " kibitzed Big John from the doorway ) and finally she kissed him good night . " Go to sleep now , baby . It 's way past your bedtime , " she whispered , tucking the blanket in around his shoulders . " Hey , Johnny ! " cried Nickname from his enormous crib , " it 's still light out ! It ai n't even eight ! Enough joke is enough ! " Oh , that amused John greatly too . " Hey , " he said to the " mom , " " better sing him a lullaby , too . " She looked at her watch . " That 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since when ? " " It 's either a lullaby or a story , Mac  --  not both . " " At fifteen smackers ? " " I do n't make the rules around here , bud . I 'm only a workinggirl . For fifteen dollars you get a Caucasian mother , patient and loving , but without the extras . " " Yeah ? And since when is singin ' a lullaby to a baby a extra ' ? " " Look , there 's a war on , in case you have n't heard . What with servicemen coming through on their way to the front , we 're at it round the clock . Overtime , doubletime  --  you name it , we 're workin ' it . I can give you Rock-a-Bye-Baby ' for ninety-eight cents , but that 's the cheapest we got . " " Ninety-eight cents for Rock-a-Bye-Baby ' ? You know what I can get for ninety-eight cents down by the lake ? " " That 's your business , Mac , I 'm only tellin ' you what we got here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Big John . " Down the office , I suppose . " " You wait here , Nickname ! We 're goin ' to find out about this here war-profiteerin ' ! And Big John was down the stairs and gone . Despite thep155vehemence with which he had spoken to her , the woman seemed quite unperturbed ; she extracted a pack of cigarettes from her apron , and offered one to Nickname . " Smoke ? " she said . " Nope . I just chaw . " " Mind if I do ? " " Nope . " " Okay , " she said , " take five , pal , " and stepping to the window , lit a cigarette ; she expelled the smoke with a long weary sigh . " Look , " said Nickname , " I do n't need no lullaby , you know . " " Sure , I know , " she said , laughing softly . " That 's what they all tell me . The next morning they come down all spiffed up and shaved and Aqua Velvaed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the light on all night . I did n't need that glass of water , really .

It 's me who has to be up and down the stairs all night long , holding their hand when they wake up from a bad dream . It 's me who has to be the nurse when they get a little tummy ache at 2 A.M. and cry like they 're going to die . I do n't know  --  maybe it 's the war , but I 've never seen such colic in my life . See , I used to work the day shift around here . Put ' em in the stroller , wheel ' em around to the park , give ' em a nap , a bottle , play pattycake , and that was it , more or less .

" Here , ai n't he somethin ' l " The picture she handed Nickname was of a little tot dressed exactly as he was , and sitting up in a crib , though one not so large as his own . " He 's real cute , " said Nickname , handing the photo back through the bars . " Sure , he is , " she said softly , looking at the photo , " but do I get a chance to enjoy him ? It seems like half the naval training station was here just on Sunday alone . " " If you 're a grandmother , " asked Nickname , " how come  --  if you do n't mind my askin '  --  how come you look so young l " " I used to think it was because I was lucky .

Because if you were n't you would have been out of this life long ago . ' " When the trouble began down in the street , Nickname 's " mother " motioned him over to the window to take a look . " Well , " she said , in her unruffled way , " looks like your buddy is going to get it now . "  |p157Nickname  crawled over the side of the crib and padded to her side . On the front walk , within the glow of the carriage lamp that had been turned up on the lawn , Big John was talkingheatedly to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a laundry truck parked at the curb ; across the side of the truck it said , C. OF C. DIAPER SERVICEKAKOOLA " Who are those guys ? " Nickname asked . " Oh , " said Mary , with her soft laugh , " do n't be fooled by the name . Those two do n't happen to take any crap . " The three men entered the house . " Hey , Nickname ! " Big John called up the stairs . " Come on ! Put your jock on , Wino ! We 're gettin ' out of this clipjoint ! " " Whattaya say now , fella , this ai n't a barroom , " cautionedone of the diapermen . " It 's a comfortable middle-class home in a nice neighborhood where people know how to behave themselves .

Youp158know what you can get for four bucks down by the lake ? I hate to tell you . You know what you can get for two-fifty ? You do n't get no French song  --  you get Frenched itself ! Come on , tweak your mom on the tittie , and let 's get out of here ! " Nickname shrugged . " I guess we 're goin ' now , " he said to Mary . " Suits me . I been up since four . That 'll be fifteen . " Nickname looked down the stairway to Big John . " Dawn ? It 'll be fifteen . " " Yeah , well , you tell her it 'll he five , what with it bein ' not even nine in the night . " " Sorry , Mac , " said Mary . " Fifteen . " Big John said , " Five , slit , " and reaching into his pocket for some change , added , " but here 's two bits for yourself , for givin ' us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the diapermen was beneath Big John , pinned to the floor of the playpen  --  an alphabet block stuffed in his mouth  --  and the other was preparing to bring the fire truck down on the first baseman 's head , when the sirens came screaminginto the street . " The cops ! " cried the diaperman who could still speak , and he ran for the kitchen door  --  and there was a Kakoola policeman pointing a pistol . " Pimp bastard , " said the officer , and fired into the air . Immediately , from the windows of the little white houses , men began to leap out onto the lawns , men in diapers and Doctor Dentons , some still holding bottles and clutching blanketsin their hands . Nickname and Big John , charging out through the front door , found themselves on the front lawn beside a man in combat boots and a crew cut , clinging to a teddy bear ; apparently he had been in another bedroom of the same house . " The Japs or the cops , " he screamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haw ! " Now a squad car turned up off the street and came right at them there on the lawn , siren howling and searchlight a blindingwhite . The man with the teddy bear ( a sergeant in the U.S. Marines according to the story in the morning paper about the raid on " the pink-'n-blue district " ) broke for the backyard . Zing , and he fell over into a forsythia bush , his teddy bear still in his arms . They came out with their hands in the air after that ; somep159were in tears and tried to hide their faces with their upraised arms . " Cry babies , " mumbled a cop , and he beat them around the ankles with his nightstick as they stepped up into the police van one by one . Meanwhile , they had begun to empty the houses of the " mothers . " Storybooks in hand , they filed out , women more or less resembling Mary , wearing aprons and cotton dresses , and all , it would seem , very much in possession of themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars and frisked by a policewoman ; standing together in the street , they looked as though they might have been called together to give the neighborhood endorsement for 20 Mule Team Borax , rather than to he charged with a crime of vice . When the policewoman reached into Mary 's apron pocket and withdrew a handful of diaper pins , she exploded  --  " You and your diapers and your diaper pins and your diaper service ! Filth ! You live in filth ! You 're a disgrace to your sex ! " " Lay off , " said the cop who was covering the " mothers " with a submachine gun . " Shit and puke and piss ! Just get a whiff of them ! " " Lay off , Sarge , " said the armed policeman . But she could n't . " You perverts make a person sick , you stink so bad ! " And she spat in Mary 's face , to show her contempt . The " mothers " stood in the middle of Euphrates Drive listeningwith expressionless faces to the insults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh to themselves , however , for nothing the policewoman said could begin to approach the contempt that they felt for their own lives . Nor did the " mothers " show any emotion when the diapermen , many of them badly beaten and covered with blood , were driven past them with nightsticks , and pushed on their faces into the police van . Only when the body of the dead customerwith the teddy bear was carried to the ambulance  --  diapered down below , and above now too , where they had covered the fatal wound in his head  --  only then did one of them speak . It was the woman who had fed him that night . " He was , just a boy , " she sari -- to which a policeman replied , " Yeah , and so is I litter . " " I would n't doubt it , " the " mother " answered , and for herp160cheekiness was removed from the line and taken by two policemeninto the back of a squad car . " What do you want to hear , officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Three Bears or  --  " " Shut her up ! " shouted the policewoman , and they did . The van for the " mothers " was over an hour in arriving ; it grew cold out in the street , and though the abuse from the policewoman grew more and more vile , the " mothers " never once complained . Now because of the proximity of " the hog factory " to the ball park , playing against the Butchers in the Pork Capital of the World had never been considered a particularly savory experienceby Patriot League players , and it was a long-standing joke among them that they would rather be back home cleaning out cesspools for a living than have to call Aceldama their home on a sultry August day . Of course , one full season at Butcher Field and a newcomer was generally as accustomed to the aromas wafting in from the abattoir as to the odors of the hot dogs cooking on the grill back of third . Only the visiting teams kept up their complaining year in and year out , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds . Visiting rookies would invariably give a start at the noise that came from a pig having his throat slit just the other side of the left-field wall , and when a thousand of the terrified beasts started in screaming at the same time , it was not unheard of for a youngsterin pursuit of a fly ball to fall cowering to his knees . In ' 43 , the Mundys had to come through Aceldama to play not just eleven , but twenty-two games , and from the record they made there that year , it would not appear that playing twice as many times in Butcher Field as each of the other six clubs did much to accustom them to the nearby slaughterhouse and processing plant . " Lose to this mess of misfits , " the Butcher manager , Round Ron Spam , had warned his team when the Mundys  --  fresh from their disasters in Kakoolacameto town to open their first four-game series of the year , " and it is worse than a loss . It is a disgrace . And it will cost you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory either  --  I want carnage . " Subsequently the Bloodthirsty Butchers , asp161they came to be called that year , went on to defeat the Mundys twenty-two consecutive times , yet another of the records compiledagainst ( or by ) the roaming Ruppert team . The headlines of the Aceldama Terminator told the story succinctly enough : MUNDYS MAULED MUNDYS MALLETTED MUNDYS MUZZLED MUNDYS MURDEREDMUNDYS MOCKEDMUNDYS MINEDMUNDYS MOWED DOWNMUNDYS MESMERIZEDMUNDYS MORGUEDMUNDYS MANGLEDMUNDYS MASHEDMUNDYS MUTILATEDMUNDYS MANHANDLEDMUNDYS MAUSOLEUMEDMUNDYS MACK-TRUCKEDMUNDYS MELTED MUNDYS MAROONED MUNDYS MUMMIFIED MUNDYS MORTIFIED MUNDYS MASSACRED MUNDYS MANACLED and , after the final game of the season between the two clubs , in which " the meat end , " so-called , of the Aceldama batting order hit five consecutive home runs in the bottom of the eighthMUNDYS MERCY-KILLEDFrom Aceldama , which was the third stop on the western swing after Asylum and Kakoola , the Mundys traveled overnightto the oldest Pony Express station in the Wild West and 1 he furthest , western outpost in any of the major leagues , Terra Incognita , Wyoming , there to play against the least hospitable crowd they had to put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and called it quits itt the middle of his first season as a 1instler . Arier twenty years as the hero ofp162Rupe-it rootas  --  loving , tender , loyal , impassioned Rupe-it rootas !  --  how could he take those Terra Inc. fans in their bandannas and their undershirts , staring silently down at him in that open oven of a ball park ? To be sure , in Luke 's case , their silence had been punctuated with derisive insults and chilling coyote calls from the distant bleachers , but what nearly drove you nuts out there was n't the noises , no matter how brutish , but that otherworldly quiet , that emptiness , and that staring : the miners , the farmers , the ranchers , the cowhands , the drifters , even the Indians packed into their little roped-off corner of the left-field stands , silent and staring . Or maybe the word is glaring . As though there was nothing more horrible to behold than these Mundys , a bunch of ballplayers who came from , of all places , nowhere . Then there was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten yet the fast one that had been put over on them back in ' 32 . Oh , you could see it plain as day in the set of the jaw of those Indians : a time would come when they would take their vengeance on these white men who had sold them a lemon for a hundred thousand dollars . As though Hothead , or Bud , or the Deacon had made a single nickel off that deal ! As though these poor homeless bastards had anything to do with what had happened to the people of Terra Incognita ten long years ago ! No , it was not pleasant being a Ruppert Mundy in the far western reaches of America . If the white ball emerging out of the acre of white undershirts in deep center was n't enough to terrify a batsman who was a stranger to these parts , there were those cold , contemptuous , vengeful eyes looking him over from the seats down both foul lines . How they drew a bead on you with those eyes ! Why , you had only to scoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for those eyes to tell you , in no uncertain terms , " That there dirt ai n't yours  --  it 's ours . Put it back where you got it , pardner . " And if you were a Ruppert Mundy and the year was 1943 , you put it back all right , and pronto . And then the long , long train ride back to the East , " the eastern swing " as it was called by the four western clubs , and by the Mundys too , though always self-consciously , for they were hardly a western club in anybody 's eyes , including their own . But then strictly speaking they were n't an eastern chubp163anymore either , even if on those eastward journeys , when they turned their watches ahead , the rapid sweep of the minute hand around the dial encouraged them to imagine the present over and done with , and the future , the return to Ruppert , upon them . Independence , Virginia , where tourists surge through cobbled streets , and taxi drivers wear buckled shoes and powderedwigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shillingsand pence ; where busloads of schoolkids line up next to the pillory in the town square to have their photo taken being punished , and a town crier appears in the streets at nine every night to shut the place down in accordance with the famous " Blue Laws " after which the baseball team is named . Talk about a place where they make a grown man feel welcome , and you are not talking about Independence , Virginia .. . And then the worst of it , the coastal journey north from Independence to Tri-City , passing through Port Ruppert on the way . . . Port Ruppert ? Looked more like the Maginot Line . Soldierseverywhere . Two of them , fine-looking young fellows in gleaming boots and wearing pistols , hopped aboard the engine as it slowed in the railroad yard , awaiting clearance to enter the station . Guards in steel helmets and bearing arms stood some fifty feet apart all the way along the tracks , while still other soldiers , in shirt sleeves and blowing on whistles , directed empty flatcars into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where were the hobos who used to squat on their haunches cooking a potato at the track 's edge , the bums who used to smile their toothless smiles up at the Mundys when they returned from the road ? Where were the old signalmen who used to raise their lanterns in salute , and , win or loss , call out , " Welcome home , boys ! You done okay ! " Where , where were their hundred thousand loyal fans ? " Have n't you heard ? " the Mundys chided themselves , " there 's a war on . " With a gush from the train ( and a sigh from the Mundys ) , they glided the last hundred yards into the station . " Rupe-it ! Station Rape-it ! " the conductor called , and though many discinhnrked , nobody who played for the team of that name left his seat.  |p164Ru|pe-it  . Oh , how could something so silly as the way they pronounced those two syllables give you the gooseflesh ? Two little syllables , Rupe and It , how could they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were announcing the arrival of their train in four different languages . Listen ! English , French , Russian  --  and Chinese ! In Rupe-it ! And catch them faces ? And all them uniforms ! Why , you did not think there could be so many shades of khaki ! Or kinds of hats ! Or belts ! Or salutes ! Or shades of skin , for that matter ! Why , there was a bunch of soldier boys wearing earrings , for Christ sake ! Where the hell are they from and how come they 're on our side , anyway ? Damn , who they gon na scare , dressin ' up like that ! Hey , am I seein ' things or is that there big coon talkin ' to that other coon in French ? Hey , Ass-Start , is them niggers parlayvooin ' French ? Wee-wee ? Hey , Frenchy 's cousins is in town , haw haw ! Hey  --  ai n't those things Chinks ? Yeah ? And I thought they was supposed to walk in them little steps ! I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time before . Kinda like a dream , ai n't it ? Hey  --  lookee there at them beards on them boys ! Now where you figger those fellers hail from ? Eskimos ? In this heat ? They would be leakin ' at the seams , they would be dead . Zanzeebar ? Never heard of ' em . And now what do you think them tiny little guys is ? Some kind of wop looks like to me , only smaller . And now clang if that ai n't some other kind of Chink altogether  --  over there ! Unless it 's their Navy ! Christ , the Chinee Navy ! I did n't even know they had one . And in Rupe-it ! Now the two soldiers who had leaped aboard in the yard came through each car checking the papers of all the service personnel . Because of the crowding the Mundys were huddled together now , three to a seat , in the last car of the train . " You fellas all flat-footed ? " the soldier quipped , looking around at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Or are you enemy spies ? " " We are ballplayers , Corporal , " said Jolly Cholly . " We are the Ruppert Mundys . " " I 'll be darned , " the young corporal retorted . " We are on our way to play four games against the Tycoons up in Tri-City. "  | " I do n't believe it , " said the corporal . " The Mundys ! " " Right you are , " said Jolly Cholly . " And you know what I took you for ' ? " said the corporal . " What 's that ? " " All squished up there , looking out the windows with them looks on your faces ' ? I took you for a bunch of war-torn immigrants , just off the boat . I took you for somebody we just saved . " " Nope , " said Jolly Cholly , " we ai n't off no boat . We 're from here . Matter of fact , " he added , peering out the window , " probably the only folks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the corporal . " Do you know , when I was just a little boy  --  " But no sooner had he begun to reminisce , than the train was moving . " U1-oh . See ya ! " the corporal called , and in a flash he was gone . And so was Rupe-it . Ballplayers ' ballplayers  --  that was the phrase most commonly used to describe the Tycoon teams that in the first four decades of the twentieth century won eighteen pennants , eight World Series , and never once finished out of the first division . " Play , " though , is hardly the word to describe what they were about down on the field . Leaving the heroics to others , without ferocity or even exertion , they concentrated on doing only what was required of them to win , neither more nor less : no whooping , no hollering , no guesswork , no gambling , no elation , no despair , nothing extreme or eccentric . Rather , efficiency , intelligence , proportion  --  four runs for the pitcher who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure , one in the ninth for him who rose only to the challenge . You rarely heard of the Tycoons breaking out , as teams will on occasion , with fifteen or twenty hits , or winning by ten or eleven runs ; just as rarely did you hear of them committing three errors in a game , or leaving a dozen men stranded on base , or falling , either individually or as a team , into a slump that a day 's rest could n't cure . Though they may not always have been the most gifted or spectacular players in the league considered one at a time , together they performed like nine men hatched from the same perfect egg.  |p166Of  course the fans who hated them  --  and they were legion , particularly out in the West  --  labeled them " robots , " " zombies , " and even " snobs " because of their emotionless , machinelikemanner . Out-of-town fans would jeer at them , insult and abuse them , do everything they could think of to try to rattle them  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economical , virtually invisible way in which the Tycoonsdisplayed their superiority year in and year out . Afterwards it was not always clear how exactly they had done it . " Where was we when it happened " was a line made famous by a Rustler who did not even know his team had been soundly beaten until he looked up at the end of the ninth and read the sad news off the scoreboard . " They ai n't human , " the other players complained , " they ai n't all there , " but out of their uniforms and in street clothes , the Tycoons turned out to be fellows more or less resembling themselves , if a little better dressed and smoother in conversation . " But they ai n't that good ! " the fans would cry , after the Tycoons had come through to sweep a four-game series  --  and yet there never did appear to be anybody that was better . " They steal them games ! They take ' em while nobody 's lookin ' ! " " It 's that park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunfield and all them shadows ! " " The way they does it , they can win all they want , and I still ai n't got no use for ' ern ! I would n't be a Tycoonfan if you paid me ! " But the even-tempered Tycoons could n't have cared less . By ' 43 , the Tycoons had lost just about every last member of the ' 41 and ' 42 pennant-winning teams to the Army , but to take their place for the duration , the Tri-City owner , Mrs. Angela Trust , had been able to coax out of retirement the world championship Tycoon team that in the ' 31 World Series against Connie Mack 's A 's had beaten Lefty Grove , Waite Hoyt , and Rube Walberg on three successive afternoons . To see those wonderful old-timers back in Tycoon uniforms , wearing the numerals each had made famous during the great baseball era that preceded the Depression , did much to assure baseball fans that the great days they dimly remembered really had been , and would be again , once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mundys ,  |p167however  , was not so salutary . After having traveled on that train through a Port Ruppert station aswarm with foreigners of every color and stripe , after having been taken for strangersin the city whose name they bore , it was really more than the Mundys could bear , to hear the loudspeaker announce the names of the players against whom they were supposed to compete that afternoon . " Pinch me , I 'm dreamin ' again , " said Kid Heket . " Why not raise up the dead , " cried Hothead , " so we can play a series against the Hall of Fame ! " " It must be a joke , " the pitchers agreed . Only it was n't . Funny perhaps to others  --  as so much was that year  --  but , alas , no joke for the Ruppert team . " For Tri-City , batting first , No. 12 , Johnny Leshy , third base . Batting second , No. 11 , Lou Polevik , left field . Batting third , No. 1 , Tommy Heimdall , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first base . Batting fifth , No. 6 , Vic Bragi , center field . Batting sixth , No. 2 , Babe Rustem , shortstop . Batting seventh , No. 19 , Tony Izanagi , second base . Batting eighth and catching for Tri-City , No. 4 , Al Bongo . . . " By the time the announcer had gotten to the Tycoons ' starting pitcher , the Mundys would have passed from bewildermentthrough disbelief to giddiness  --  all on the long hard road to resignation . " Oh yeah , and who 's the pitcher ' ? Who is pitching the series against us  --  the Four Horsemen , I sup-pose . " They supposed right . They were to face the four Tycoon starters who had performed in rotation with such regularity and such success for over a decade , that eventually the sportswriterSmitty humorously suggested in " An Open Letter to the United States Congress " that they ought to call the days of the week after Sal Tuisto , Smoky Woden , Phil Thor , and Herman Frigg . By ' 42 , Tuisto owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball coach at the nearby Ivy League college , Thor was a bowling alley impresario , and I+'rigg a Ford dealer ; nonetheless , despite all those years that had elapsed since the four had been big leaguers , against the lnndys in the first series played between the two clubs in Tycoon I'ark that year , each threw the second no-hitter of his career  - -  four consecutive hitless games , a record of coursep168for four pitchers on the same team . . . But then that was only the beginning of the records broken in that series , which itself broke the record for breaking records. *One sunny Saturday morning early in August , the Ruppert Mundys boarded a bus belonging to the mental institution and journeyed from their hotel in downtown Asylum out into the green Ohio countryside to the world-famous hospital for the insane , there to play yet another " away " game  --  a threeinningexhibition match against a team composed entirely of patients . The August visit to the hospital by a P. League team in town for a series against the Keepers was an annual event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was believed to be of considerable therapeutic value to the inmates , particularlythe sports-minded among them . Not only was it their chance to make contact , if only for an hour or so , with the real world they had left behind , but it was believed that even so brief a visit by famous big league ballplayers went a long way to assuage the awful sense such people have that they are odious and contemptible to the rest of humankind . Of course the P. League players ( who like all ballplayers despised any exhibition games during the course of the regular season ) happened to find playing against the Lunatics , as they called them , a most odious business indeed ; but as the General simply would not hear of abandoning a practice that brought public attention to the humane and compassionate side of a league that many still associated with violence and scandal , the traditionwas maintained year after year , much to the delight of the insane , and the disgust of the ballplayers themselves . Some all-time records made by the ' 43 Mundys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated in no-hitters in a season  --  6Most times defeated in consecutive no-hitters in a season  --  4Most triple plays hit into in one game  --  2 Most triple plays hit into in a season  --  5 Most errors committed by a team  --  302Worst earned-run average for pitching staff  --  8.06 Most walks by a pitching staff  --  872 Most wild pitches by staff in an inning  --  8 Most wild pitches by staff in a game  --  14p169The chief psychiatrist at the hospital was a Dr. Traum , a heavyset gentleman with a ( lark chin beard , and a pronounced European accent . Until his arrival in America in the thirties , he had never even heard of baseball , but in that Asylum was the site of a major league ball park , as well as a psychiatric hospital , it was not long before the doctor became something of a student of the game . After all , one whose professional life involved ruminating upon the extremes of human behavior , had certainly to sit up and take notice when a local fan decided to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing streak , or when an Asylum man beat his wife to death with a hammer for calling the Keepers " bums " just like himself . If the doctor did not , strictly speaking , become an ardent Keeper fan , he did make it his business to read thoroughly in the literature of the national pastime , with the result that over the years more than one P. League manager had to compliment the bearded Berliner on his use of the hitand-run , and the uncanny ability he displayed at stealing signalsduring their annual exhibition game . Despite the managerial skill that Dr. Traum had developedover the years through his studies , his team proved no match for the Mundys that morning . By August of 1943 , the Mundys were n't about to sit back and take it on the chin from a German-born baseball manager and a team of madmen ; they had been defeated and disgraced and disgraced and defeated up and down the league since the season had begun back in April , and it was as though on the morning they got out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seething in them for months now burst forth , and nothing , but nothing , could have prevented them from grinding the Lunatics into dust once the possibility for victory presented itself . Suddenly , those ' 43 flops started looking and sounding like the scrappy , hustling , undefeatable Ruppert teams of Luke Gofannon 's day  --  and this despite the fact that it took nearly an hour to complete a single inning , what with numerous delays and interruptions caused by the Lunatics ' style of play . TTardly a moment passed that something did not occur 10 offend the professional dignity of a big leaguer , and yet , through it all , the icnidys on both offense and defense managed to seize hold oI ' every Lunatic mistake and convert it top170their advantage . Admittedly , the big right-hander who started for the institution team was fast and savvy enough to hold the Mundy power in check , but playing just the sort of heads-up , razzle-dazzle baseball that used to characterize the Mundy teams of yore , they were able in their first at bat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nickname , a base on balls to Big John , and two Lunatic errors , to score three runs  --  their biggest inning of the year , and the first Mundy runs to cross the plate in sixty consecutive innings , which was not a record only because they had gone sixty-seven innings without scoring earlier in the season . When Roland Agni , of all people , took a called third strike to end their half of the inning , the Mundys rushed off the bench like a team that smelled World Series loot . " We was due ! " yelped Nickname , taking the peg from Hothead and sweeping his glove over the bag  --  " Nobody gon na stop us now , babe ! We was due ! We was overdue ! " Then he winged the ball over to where Deacon Demeter stood on the mound , grinning . " Three big ones for you , Deke ! " Old Deacon , the fiftyyear-oldiron-man starter of the Mundy staff , already a twenty-game loser with two months of the season still to go , shot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off evil spirits , stroked the rabbit 's foot that hung on a chain around his neck , closed his eyes to mumble something ending with " Amen , " and then stepped up on the rubber to face the first patient . Deacon was a preacher back home , as gentle and kindly a man as you would ever want to bring your problems to , but up on the hill he was all competitor , and had been for thirty years now . " When the game begins , " he used to say back in his heyday , " charity ends . " And so it was that when he saw the first Lunatic batter digging in as though he owned the batter 's box , the Deke decided to take Hothead 's advice and stick the first pitch in his ear , just to show the little nut who was boss . The Deacon had taken enough insults that year for a fifty-year-old man of the cloth ! Not only did the Deke 's pitch cause the batter to go flying back from the plate to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was running for the big brick building with the iron bars on its windows . Two of his teammates caught him down the right-field line and with the help of thep171Lunatic bullpen staff managed to drag him back to home plate . But once there they could n't get him to take hold of the bat ; every time they put it into his hands , he let it fall through to the ground . By the time the game was resumed , with a 1 and 0 count on a new lead-off hitter , one not quite so cocky as the fellow who 'd stepped up to bat some ten minutes earlier , there was no doubt in anyone 's mind that the Deke was in charge . As it turned out , twice in the inning Mike Rama had to go sailing up into the wall to haul in a long line drive , but as the wall was padded , Mike came away unscathed , and the Deacon was back on the bench with his three-run lead intact . " We 're on our way ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ! Hothead too was dancing with excitement ; cupping his hands to his mouth , he shouted across to the opposition , " Just watch you bastards go to pieces now ! " And so they did . The Deke 's pitching and Mike 's fielding seemed to have shaken the confidence of the big Lunatic righthanderwhose fastball had reined in the Mundys in the first . To the chagrin of his teammates , he simply would not begin to pitch in the second until the umpire stopped staring at him . " Oh , come on , " said the Lunatic catcher , " he 's not staring at you . Throw the ball . " " I tell you , he 's right behind you and he is too staring . Look you , I see you there behind that mask . What is it you want from me ? What is it you think you 're looking at , anyway2 " The male nurse , in white half-sleeve shirt and white trousers , who was acting as the plate umpire , called out to the mound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not until you come out from there . " " Oh , pitch , for Christ sake , " said the catcher . " Not until that person stops staring . " Here Dr. Traum came off the Lunatic bench and started for the field , while down in the Lunatic bullpen a left-hander got up and began to throw . Out on the mound , with his hands clasped behind his back and rocking gently to and fro on his spikes , the doctor conferred with the pitcher . Formal Europeanthat he was , he wore , along with his regulation baseball shoes , a dark three-piece business suit , a stiff collar , and a tie.  | " What do you think the of doe 's tellin ' that boy ? " Bud Parusha asked Jolly Cholly . " Oh , the usual , " the old-timer said . " He 's just calmin ' him down . He 's just askin ' if he got any good duck shootin ' last season . " It was five full minutes before the conference between the doctor and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher to hand over the ball . When the . pitcher vehemently refused , it was necessary for the doctor to snatch the ball out of his hand ; but when he motioned down to the bullpen for the left-hander , the pitcher suddenly reached out and snatched the ball back . Here the doctor turned back to the bullpen and this time motioned for the left-hander and a right-hander . Out of the bullpen came two men dressed like the plate umpire in white half-sleeve shirts and white trousers . While they took the long walk to the mound , the doctor made several unsuccessfulattempts to talk the pitcher into relinquishing the ball . Finally the two men arrived on the mound and before the pitcher knew what had happened , they had unfurled a straitjacket and wrapped it around him . " Guess he wanted to stay in , " said Jolly Cholly , as the pitcher kicked out at the doctor with his feet . The hundred Lunatic fans who had gathered to watch the game from the benches back of the foul screen behind home plate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any baseball crowd , rose to applaud the pitcher as he left the field , but when he opened his mouth to acknowledge the ovation , the two men assisting him in his departure slipped a gag over his mouth . Next the shortstop began to act up . In the first inning it was he who had gotten the Lunatics out of trouble with a diving stab of a Bud Parusha liner and a quick underhand toss that had doubled Wayne Heket off third . But now in the top of the second , though he continued to gobble up everything hit to the left of the diamond , as soon as he got his hands on the ball he proceeded to stuff it into his back pocket . Then , assuming a posture of utter nonchalance , he would start whistling between his teeth and scratching himself , as though waiting for the action to begin . In that it was already very much underway , the rest of the Lunatic infield would begin screaming atp173him to take the ball out of his pocket and make the throw to first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent smile . " The ball ! " they cried . " Yes , what about it ? " " Throw it ! " " But I do n't have it . " " You do ! " they would scream , converging upon him from all points of the infield , " You do too ! " " Hey , leave me alone , " the shortstop cried , as they grabbed and pulled at his trousers . " Hey , cut that out  --  get your hands out of there ! " And when at last the ball was extracted from where he himself had secreted it , no one could have been more surprised . " Hey , the ball . Now who put that there ? Well , what 's everybody looking at me for ? Look , this must be some guy 's idea of a joke . . . Well , Christ , I did n't do it . " Once the Mundys caught on , they were quick to capitalize on this unexpected weakness in the Lunatic defense , pushing two more runs across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  both beaten out for hits while the shortstop grappled with the other infielders  --  a sacrifice by Mike Rama , and a fly to short center that was caught by the fielder who then just stood there holding it in his glove , while Hothead , who was the runner on second , tagged up and hobbled to third , and then , wooden leg and all , broke for home , where he scored with a head-first slide , the only kind he could negotiate . As it turned out , the slide was n't even necessary , for the centerfielderwas standing in the precise spot where he had made the catch  --  and the ball was still in his glove . With the bases cleared , Dr. Traum asked for time and walked out to center . He put a hand on the shoulder of the mute and motionless fielder and talked to him in a quiet voice . He talked to him steadily for fifteen minutes , their faces only inches apart . Then he stepped aside , and the center-fielder took the ball from the pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catcher , on his knees at the plate some two hundred feet away . " Wow , " said Bud Parusha , with ungrudging admiration , " now , that fella has a arm on him . " " Hothead , " said Cholly , mildly chiding the catcher , " he woulda had you by a country mile , you know , if only he 'd a throwed it .. " But Isot , riding high , hollered out , " woulda do n't count , Charles - it 's dudda what counts , and I dud it ! "  |p174Meanwhile  Kid Heket , who before this morning had not been awake for two consecutive innings in over a month , continued to stand with one foot up on the bench , his elbow on his knee and his chin cupped contemplatively in his palm . He had been studying the opposition like this since the game had gottenunderway , " You know somethin ' , " he said , gesturing toward the field , " those fellas ai n't thinkin ' . No sir , they just ai n't usin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the run , Wayne ! " cried Nickname . " They do n't know what hit ' ern ! Damn , ai n't nobody gon na stop us from here on out ! " Deacon was hit hard in the last of the second , but fortunatelyfor the Mundys , in the first two instances the batsman refused to relinquish the bat and move off home plate , and so each was thrown out on what would have been a base hit , right-fielder Parusha to first-baseman Baal ; and the last hitter , who drove a tremendous line drive up the alley in left center ; ran directly from home to third and was tagged out sitting on the bag with what he took to be a triple , and what would have been one too , had he only run around the bases and gotten to third in the prescribed way . The quarrel between the Lunatic catcher and the relief pitcher began over what to throw Big John Baal , the lead-off hitter in the top of the third . " Uh-uh , " said the Lunatic pitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while in the box , Big John took special pleasure in swishing the bat around menacingly . " Nope , " said the pitcher to the second signal . His response to the third was an emphatic , " N-0 ! " And to the fourth , he said , stamping one foot , " Definitely not ! " When he shook off a fifth signal as well , with a caustic , " Are you kidding ? Throw him that and it 's bye-bye ballgame , " the catcher yanked off his mask and cried : " And I suppose that 's what I want , according to you ! To lose ! To go down in defeat ! Oh , sure , " the catcher whined , " what I 'm doing , you see , is deliberately telling you to throw him the wrong pitch so I can have the wonderful pleasure of being on the losing team again . Oh brother ! " His sarcasmp175spent , he donned his mask , knelt down behind the plate , and tried yet once more . This time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look to the heavens for solace . " God give me strength , " he sighed . " In other words , " the catcher screamed , " I 'm wrong again . But then in your eyes I 'm always wrong . Well , is n't that true  --  ? Admit it ! Whatever signal I give is bound to be wrong . Why ? Because I 'm giving it ! I 'm daring to give you a signal ! I 'm daring to tell you how to pitch ! I could kneel here signaling for the rest of my days , and you 'd just stand there shaking them off and asking God to give you strength , because I 'm so wrong and so stupid and so hopeless and would rather lose than win ! " When the relief pitcher , a rather self-possessed fellow from the look of it , though perhaps a touch perverse in his own way , refused to argue , the Lunatic catcher once again assumed his squat behind the plate , and proceeded to offer a seventh signal , an eighth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the pitcher rejected with a mild , if unmistakably disdainful , remark . On the sixteenth signal , the pitcher just had to laugh . " Well , that one really takes the cake , does n't it ? That really took brains . Come over here a minute , " he said to his infielders . " All right , " he called back down to the catcher , " go ahead , show them your new brainstorm . " To the four players up on the mound with him , the pitcher whispered , " Catch this , " and pointed to the signal that the catcher , in his mortification , was continuing to flash from between his legs . " Hey , " said the Lunatic third-baseman , " that ai n't even a finger , is it ? " " No , " said the pitcher , " as a matter of fact , it is n't . " " I mean , it ai n't got no nail on it , does it ? " " Indeed it has not . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it 's , it 's his thingamajig . " " Precisely , " said the pitcher . " But what the hell is that supposed to mean ? " asked the first-baseman.  |p176The  pitcher had to smile again . " What do you think ? Hey , Doc , " he called to the Lunatic bench , " I 'm afraid my batterymatehas misunderstood what 's meant by an exhibition game . He 's flashing me the signal to meet him later in the shower , if you know what I mean . " The catcher was in tears now . " He made me do it , " he said , covering himself with his big glove , and in his shame , dropping all the way to his knees , " everything else I showed him was n't good enough for him  --  no , he teases me , he taunts me  --  " By now the two " coaches " ( as they were euphemistically called ) , who had removed the starting pitcher from the game , descended upon the catcher . With the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted the catcher 's member and placed it back inside his uniform before the opposing players could see what the signal had been , while the other relieved him of his catching equipment . " He provoked me , " the catcher said , " he always provokes me  --  " The Lunatic fans were on their feet again , applauding , when their catcher was led away from the plate and up to the big brick building , along the path taken earlier by the starting pitcher . "  --  He wo n't let me alone , ever . I do n't want to do it . I never wanted to do it . I would n't do it . But then he starts up teasing me and taunting me  --  " The Mundys were able to come up with a final run in the top of the third , once they discovered that the second-string Lunatic catcher , for all that he sounded like the real thing  --  " Chuck to me , babe , no hitter in here , babe  --  " was a little leery of fielding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearful apparently of what he would find beneath the ball upon picking it up . When Deacon started out to the mound to pitch the last of the three innings , there was n't a Mundy who took the field with him , sleepy old Kid Heket included , who did n't realize that the Deke had a shutout working . If he could set the Lunatics down without a run , he could become the first Mundy pitcher to hurl a scoreless game all year , in or out of league competition . Hoping neither to jinx him or unnerve him , the players went through the infield warm-up deliberately keeping the chatter to a minimum , as though in fact it was just another day theyp177were going down to defeat . Nonetheless , the Deke was already streaming perspiration when the first Lunatic stepped into the box . He rubbed the rabbit 's foot , said his prayer , took a swallow of air big enough to fill a gallon jug , and on four straight pitches , walked the center-fielder , who earlier in the game had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fly ball , and now , at the plate , had n't moved the bat off his shoulder . When he was lifted for a pinch-runner ( lifted by the " coaches " ) the appreciative fans gave him a nice round of applause . " That 's lookin ' ' em over ! " they shouted , as he was carried from the field still in the batting posture , " that 's waitin ' ' em out ! Good eye in there , fella ! " As soon as the pinch-runner took over at first , it became apparent that Dr. Traum had decided to do what he could to save face by spoiling the Deacon 's shutout . Five runs down in the last inning and still playing to win , you do n't start stealing bases  --  but that was precisely what this pinch-runner had in mind . And with what daring ! First , with an astonishing burst of speed he rushed fifteen feet down the basepath  --  but then , practically on all fours , he was scrambling back . " No ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag with his outstretched hand , " I wo n't ! Never mind ! Forget it ! " But no sooner had he gotten back up on his feet and dusted himself off , than he was running again . " Why not ! " he cried , " what the hell ! " But having broken fifteen , twenty , feet down the basepath , he would come to an abrupt stop , smite himself on his forehead , and charge wildly back to first , crying , " Am I crazy ? Am I out of myIn this way did he travel back and forth along the basepathsome half-dozen times , before Deacon finally threw the first pitch to the plate . Given all there was to distract him , the pitch was of course a ball , low and in the dirt , but Hothead , having a great day , blocked it beautifully with his wooden leg . Cholly , managing the club that morning while Mister H'airsmith rested back in Asylum  --  of the aged Mundy manager'sspiritual crisis , more anon  --  Cholly motioned for Chico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullpen ( one was enough  --  one was too many , in fact , as far as Chico was concerned ) and meanwhile took a stroll out to the hill . Startin ' to gel to you , are they ? " asked Cholly.  | " It 's that goofball on first that 's doin ' it . " Cholly looked over to where the runner , with time out , was standing up on first engaged in a heated controversy with himself . " Hell , " said Cholly , in his soft and reassuring way , " these boys have been tryin ' to rattle us with that there bush league crap all mornin ' , Deke . I told you fellers comin ' out in the bus , you just got to pay no attention to their monkeyshines , because that is their strategy from A to Z. To make you lose your concentration . Otherwise we would be rollin ' over them worse than we is . But Deke , you tell me now , if you have had it , if you want for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my hip pocket ? And a shutout goin ' ? " " Well , I was n't myself goin ' to mention that last that you said . " " Cholly , you and me been in this here game since back in the days they was rubbin ' us down with Vaseline and Tabasco sauce . Ai n't that right ? " " I know , I know . " " Well , " said the Deke , shooting a stream of tobacco juice over his shoulder , " ai n't a bunch of screwballs gon na get my goat . Tell Chico to sit down . " Sure enough , the Deacon , old war-horse that he was , got the next two hitters out on long drives to left . " Oh my God ! " cried the base runner , each time the Ghost went climbing up the padded wall to snare the ball . " Imagine if I 'd broken for second ! Imagine what would have happened then ! Oh , that 'll teach me to take those crazy leads ! But then if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where are you as a pinch-runner ? That 's the whole idea of a pinch-runner  --  to break with the pitch , to break before the pitch , to score that shutout-breaking run ! That 's what I 'm in here for , that 's my entire purpose . The whole thing is on my shoulders  --  so then what am I doing not taking a good long lead ? But just then , if I 'd broken for second , I 'd have been doubled off first ! For the last out ! But then suppose he had n't made the catch ? Suppose he 'd dropped it . Then where would I be ? Forced out at second ! Out  --  and all because I was too cowardly . But then what 's the sense of taking an unnecessary risk ? What virtue is there in being foolhardy ? None ! But then what about playing it too safe ? "  |p179On  the bench , Jolly Cholly winced when he saw that the batter stepping into the box was the opposing team 's shortstop . " Uh-oh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost ' em most of the runs to begin with . I 'm afraid he is goin ' to be lookin ' to right his wrongs  --  and at the expense of Deacon 's shutout . Dang ! " From bearing down so hard , the Deacon 's uniform showed vast dark continents of perspiration both front and back . There was no doubt that his strength was all but gone , for he was relying now solely on his " junk , " that floating stuff that in times gone by used to cause the hitters nearly to break their backs swinging at the air . Twice now those flutter balls of his had damn near been driven out of the institution and Jolly Cholly had all he could do not to cover his eyes with his hand when he saw the Deke release yet another fat pitch in the direction of home plate . Apparently it was just to the Lunatic shortstop 's liking too . He swung from the heels , and with a whoop of joy , was away from the plate and streaking down the basepath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . But the pinch-runner was standing up on Run , you idiot ! " " But  --  where is it 2 " asked the pinch-runner . The Mundy infielders were looking skywards themselves , wondering where in hell that ball had been hit to . " Where is it ! " screamed the pinch-runner , as the shortstopcame charging right up to his face . " I 'm not running till I know where the ball is ! " " I 'm coming into first , you , " warned the shortstop . " But you ca n't overtake another runner ! That 's against the law ! That 's out ! " " Then move ! " screamed the shortstop into the fellow 's ear . " Oh , this is crazy . This is exactly what I did n't want to do ! " But what choice did he have ? If he stood his ground , and the shortstop kept coming , that would be the ballgame . It would be all over because he who had been put into the game to run , had simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rounded the bases with the shortstop right on his tail . " I 'm running full speed  --  and I do n't even know where the ball is ! I 'm running like a chicken with his head cut off ! I 'm running like a madman , which is just what I do n't want to do ! Or be ! I do n't know where I 'm going , I do n't know what I 'm doing , I have n't the foggiest idea of what 's happening  --  and I 'm running ! " When , finally , he crossed the plate , he was in such a state , that he fell to his hands and knees , and sobbing with relief , began to kiss the ground . " I 'm home ! Thank God ! I 'm safe ! I made it ! I scored ! Oh thank God , thank God ! " And now the shortstop was rounding third  --  he took a quick glance back over his shoulder to see if he could go all the way , and just kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Cholly . " What in hell does he see that I ca n't ? Or that Mike do n't either ? " For out in left , Mike Rama was walking round and round , searching in the grass as though for a dime that might have dropped out of his pocket . The shortstop was only a few feet from scoring the second run of the inning when Dr. Traum , who all this while had been walking from the Lunatic bench , interposed himself along the foul line between the runner and home plate . " Doc , " screamed the runner , " you 're in the way ! " " That 's enough now , " said Dr. Traum , and he motioned for him to stop in his tracks . " But I 'm only inches from pay dirt ! Step aside , Doc  --  let me score ! " " You just stay vere you are , please . " " You know vy . Stay right vere you are now . And giff me the ball . " " What ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball . " " Well , I surely do n't have any ball . I 'm the hitter . I 'm about to score . " " You are not about to score . You are about to giff me the ball . Come now . Enough foolishness . Giff over the ball . " " But , Doc , I have n't got it . I 'm on the offense . It 's the defense that has the ball  --  that 's the whole idea of the game.  |p181No  criticism intended , but if you were n't a foreigner , you 'd probably understand that better . " " Hal it your vay , " said Dr. Traum , and he waved to the bullpen for his two coaches . " But , Doc , " said the shortstop , backpedaling now up the third-base line , " they 're the ones in the field . They 're the ones with the gloves  --  why do n't you ask them for the ball ? Why me ? I 'm an innocent base runner , who happens to be rounding third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coaches coming after him and he turned and broke across the diamond for the big brick building on the hill . It was only a matter of minutes before one of the coaches returned with the ball and carried it out to where the Mundy infield was now gathered on the mound . The Deacon turned it over in his hand and said , " Yep , that 's it , all right . Ai n't it , Hot ? " The Mundy catcher nodded . " How in hell did he get it ? " " A hopeless kleptomaniac , that 's how , " answered the coach . " He 'd steal the bases if they were n't tied down . Here , " he said , handing the Deacon a white hand towel bearing the Mundy laundrymark , and the pencil that Jolly Cholly wore behind his ear when he was acting as their manager . " Found this on him too . Looks like he got it when he stumbled into your bench for that pop-up in the first . " The victory celebration began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way back to the city , with Nickname hollering out his window to every passerby , " We heat ' ern ! We shut ' em out ! " and Big John swigging bourbon from his liniment bottle , and then passing it to his happy teammates . " I 'll tell you what did it , " cried Nickname , by far the most exuberant of the victors , " it was Deacon throwin ' at that first guy 's head ! Yessir ! Now that 's my kind of baseball ! " said the fourteen-year-old , smacking his thigh . " First man up , e it 10 ' enr right in the noggin ' . " " Right ! " said Hothead . " Show ' em you ai n't takin ' no mole of their shit no more ! Never again ! "  | " Well , " said Deacon , " that is a matter of psychology , Hot , that was somethin ' I had to think over real good beforehand . I mean , you try that on the wrong feller and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and then spikin ' the dickens out of you when you cover the bag . " " That 's so , " said Jolly Cholly . " When me and the Deke come up , that was practically a rule in the rule book  --  feller throws the beanball , the word goes out , Drag the ball and spike the pitcher . ' Tell you the truth , I was worried we was goin ' to see some of that sort of stuff today . They was a desperatebunch . Could tell that right off by their tactics . " " Well , " said the Deke , " that was a chance I had to take . But I 'll tell you , I could n't a done it without you fellers behind me . How about Bud out there , throwin ' them two runners out at first base ? The right-fielder to the first-baseman , two times in a row . Buddy , " said the Deacon , " that was an exhibitionsuch as I have not seen in all my years in organized ball . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to make it sound easy . " Well , a ' course , once I seen those guys was n't runnin ' , I figured I did n't have no choice . I had to play it to first . " Here Mike Rama said , " Only that was n't what they was figurin ' , Buddy-boy . You got a one-arm outfielder out there , you figure , what the hell , guess I can get on down the base line any old time I feel like it . Guess I can stop off and get me a beer and a sangwich on the way ! But old Bud here , guess he showed ' em ! " " You know , " said Cholly , philosophically , " I never seen it to fail , the hitters get cocky like them fellers were , and the next thing you know , they 're makin ' one dumb mistake after another . " " Yep , " said Kid Heket , who was still turning the events of the morning over in his head , " no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads . " " Well , maybe they was n't  --  but we was ! What about Hot ? " said Nickname . " What about a guy with a wooden leg taggin ' up from second and scorin ' on a fly to center ! How 's that for heads-up ball ? " " Well , " said Wayne , " I am still puzzlin ' that one out my/self . What got into that boy in center , that he just sort of stood there after the catch , alookin ' the way he did ? What in hell did he want to wait fifteen minutes for anyway , before throwin ' it ? That 's a awful long time , do n't you think ? " They all looked to Cholly to answer this one . " Well , Wayne , " he said , " I believe it is that clang cockiness again . Base runner on second 's got a wooden leg , kee-rect ? So what does Hot here do  --  he goes . And that swellhead out in center , well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time he figures out what hit him , we has got ourselves a gift of a run . Now , if I was managin ' that club , I 'd bench that there prima donna and slap a fine on him to boot . " " But then how do you figure that shortstop , Cholly ? " asked the Kid . " Now if that ai n't the strangest ballplayin ' you ever seen , what is ? Stickin ' the ball in his back pocket like that . And then when he is at bat , with a man on and his team down by six , and it is their last licks ' n all , catchin ' a junk pitch like that inside his shirt . Now I can not figure that out nohow . " " Dang cockiness again ! " cried Nickname , looking to Cholly . " He figures , hell , it 's only them Mundys out there , I can do any clang thing I please  --  well , I guess we taught him a thing or two ! Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think so , Nickname . I think what we have got there in that shortstop is one of the most tragic cases I have seen in my whole life long of all-field-no-hit . " " Kleptomaniac 's what the coach there called him , " said the Deacon . " Same thing , " said Cholly . " Why , we had a fella down in Class D when I was just startin ' out , fella name a ' Mayet . Nothin ' got by that boy . Why , Mayet at short was n't much I i t'ferent than a big pot of glue out there . Fact that 's what they called him for short : Glue . Only trouble is , he threw like a gi rl , and when it come to hittin ' , well , my pussycat probably do hotter , if I had one . Well , the same exact thing here , only w o rse . " " Okay , " said Kid Ileket , " I see that , sorta . Only how come he run over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , Cholly ? IIow donee he took our towel away , right ear the middle of the gosh darn game ? "  | " Heck , that ai n't so hard to figure out . We been havin ' such rotten luck this year , you probably forgot just who we all are , anyway . What boy would n't want a towel from a big league ball club to hang up and frame on the wall ? Why , he wanted that thing so bad that when the game was over , I went up to the doe there and I said , Doc , no hard feelin 's . You did the best you could and six to zip ai n't nothin ' to be ashamed of against big leaguers . ' And then I give him the towel to pass on to that there kleptomaniac boy when he seen him again . So as he did n't feel too bad , bein ' the last out . And know what else I told him ? I give him some advice . I said , Doc , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ninth and play him at first where he do n't have to make the throw . " " What 'd he say ? " " Oh , he laughed at me . He said , Ha ha , Jolly Cholly , you haf a good sense of humor . Who efer heard of a first-baseman batting ninth ? ' So I said , Doc , who ever heard of a fifty-yearoldpreacher hurlin ' a shutout with only three days ' rest  --  but he done it , maybe with the help of interference on the last play , but still he done it . ' " " Them 's the breaks of the game anyway ! " cried Nickname . " About time the breaks started goin ' our way . Did you tell him that , Cholly ? " " I told him that , Nickname . I told him more . I said , Doc , there is two kinds of baseball played in this country , and maybe somebody ought to tell you , bein ' a foreigner and all  --  there is by the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it  --  and I grant , those fellers win their share of pennants doin ' it that way . But then there is by hook and crook , by raw guts and all the heart you got , and that is just the way the Mundys done here today . ' " Here the team began whooping and shouting and singing with joy , though Jolly Cholly had momentarily to turn away , to struggle against the tears that were forming in his eyes . In a husky voice he went on  --  " And then I told him the name for that . I told him the name for wanderin ' your ass off all season long , and takin ' all the jokes and all the misery they can heap on your head day after day , and then comin ' on out for a exhibition game like this one , where another tearer would just go through the motions and I-not : give two hoots in hell howp185they played  --  and instead , instead givin ' it everything you got . I told the doc the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only Roland Agni , who had gone down twice , looking , against Lunatic pitching , appeared to be unmoved by Cholly 's tribute to the team . Nickname , in fact , touched Jolly Cholly 's arm at the conclusion of his speech , and whispered , " Somebody better say somethin ' to Rollie . He ai n't takin ' strikin ' out too good , it do n't look . " So Cholly the peacemaker made his way past the boisterousplayers and down the aisle to where Roland still sat huddled in a rear corner of the bus by himself . " What 's eatin ' ya , boy ? " " Nothin ' , " mumbled Roland . " Why don ' tcha come up front an '  --  " " Leave me alone , Tuminikar ! " " Aw , Rollie , come on now , " said the sympathetic coach , " even the best of them get caught lookin ' once in a while . " " Caught lookin ' ? " cried Agni . " Hey , Rollie , " Hothead shouted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And grinning , he waved Big John 's linirnentbottle in the air to prove it . " Sure , Rollie , " Nickname yelled . " With the Deke on the mound , we did n't need but one run anyway ! So what 's the difference ? Everybody 's got ta whiff sometimes ! It 's the law a ' averages ! " But Agni was now standing in the aisle , screaming , " You th ink I got caught lookin ' ? " Wayne Heket , whose day had been a puzzle from beginning to end , who just could not really take any more confusion on top of going sleepless all these hours , asked , " Well , was n't ya ? " " You bunch of morons ! You bunch of idiots ! Why , you are bigger lunatics even than they are ! Those fellers are at least locked up ! " Jolly Cholly , signaling his meaning to the other players with a wink , said , " Seems Roland got somethin ' in his eye , boys -- seems he could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ca n't see ! " Agni screamed . " They were madnren ! They Were low as low can be ! " " Oh , I do n't I:now , Rollie , " said Mike Rama , who 'd hadp186his share of scurrying around to do that morning , " they was n't that bad . " " They was worse ! And you all acted like you was takin ' on the Cardinals in the seventh game of the Series ! " " How else you supposed to play , youngster ? " asked the Deacon , who was beginning to get a little hot under the collar . " And you ! You 're the worst of all ! Hangin ' in there , like a regular hero ! Havin ' conferences on the mound about how to pitch to a bunch of hopeless maniacs ! " " Look , son , " said Jolly Cholly , " just on account you got caught lookin '  --  " " But who got caught lookin ' . How could you get caught lookin ' against pitchers that had absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jolly Cholly , incredulous , " you took a dive ? You mean you throwed it , Roland ? Why ? " " Why ? Oh , please , let me off ! Let me off this bus ! " he screamed , charging down the aisle toward the door . " I ca n't take bein ' one of you no more ! " As they were all , with the exception of the Deacon , somewhatpie-eyed , it required virtually the entire Mundy team to subdue the boy wonder . Fortunately the driver of the bus , who was an employee of the asylum , carried a straitjacket and a gag under the seat with him at all times , and knew how to use it . " It 's from bein ' around them nuts all mornin ' , " he told the Mundys . " Sometimes I ai n't always myself either , when I get home at night .

The disastrous conclusionto the foregoingadventures . IV SEPTEMBER of that wartime season , with the Keepers and I lie Reapers battling for sixth , Kakoola owner Frank Mazuma signed on a midget to help his club as a pinch-hitter in the stretch . The midget , named Yamm , was the real thing ; he stood forty inches high , weighed sixty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed the crouch that Mazuma had taught limo , he presented the pitcher with a strike zone not much larger than a matchbox . At the press conference called to introduce the midget to the world , the **27;14776;TOOLONG , fresh from the University of Wisconsin , where he 'd been the first midget ever in Sigma Chi , praised Mazuma for his courage in defying " the gentleman 's agreement " that had previously excluded people of his stature from big league ball . He said he realized that as baseball 's first midget he was going to be subjected to a good deal of ridicule ; however , he had every hope that in time even those who had started out as his enemies would come to judge him by the only thing that really mattered in this game , his value to the Kakoola Reapers . In the final analysis , Yamm asked rhetorically , what difference was there between a midget such as himself and an ordinary player , provided he contributed to the success of his team ? " The difference ? About two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mike from the midget . " And let me tell you something else about little Mr. Yamm here , gentlemen . Every time he comes to bat , I am going to be perched up on top of the grandstand with a high-powered rifle aimed at home plate . And if this little son of a buck so much as raises the bat off his shoulder , I 'll plug him ! Hear that , Pee Wee ? " Chuckling , the reporters rushed off to the phones ( suppliedby Mazuma ) to get the story to their papers in time for the evening edition . Sure enough , the first time the midget was announced over the public address system  --  " Your attention , ladies and gentlemen , pinch-hitting for the Reapers , No. 1/4 , Bob Yamm "  --  a man wearing a black eyepatch , an Army camouflage uniform , a steel helmet , and carrying a rifle , was seen to climb out through a trapdoor atop the stadium at Reaper Field and take up a firing position on the roof . Needless to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in Yamm 's first ten pinch-hitting assignments , not only did he draw ten walks , but he was not even thrown a strike . Even the sinking stuff sailed by the bill of his cap , and of course when the opposing pitchers began to press , invariably they threw the ball into the dirt , bouncing it past the midget , as though he were the batsman in cricket . In the interest of league harmony , the other P. League owners had been willing to indulge the maverick Mazuma for a game or two , expecting that either the fans would quickly tire of the ridiculous gimmick , or that General Oakhart would make Mazuma see the light ; but as it turned out , Kakooliansp191could n't have been more delighted to see Yamm drawing balls in the batter 's box ( and Mazuma taking aim at him from the stadium roof ) , and General Oakhart was as powerless as ever against Mazuma 's contempt for the time-honored ways . When the General telephoned to remind Mazuma of the dignity of the game and the integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded by calling a second press conference for the articulate Bob Yamm . " I have it on very good authority , " said Yamm , impeccablydressed in a neat pin-striped business suit and a boy 's clip-on necktie , " that the powers-that-be have threatened to pass a law at the next annual winter meeting of the owners of the Patriot Baseball League of America that will bar forever from any team in the league anyone under forty-eight inches in height . This , may I add , even as our country is engaged in a brutal and costly war in behalf of freedom and justice for all . To be sure , such a law , if passed , would only be the outright codification of that very same gentleman 's agreement ' that has operated since the inception of the eight-team Patriot League in 1898 to prevent people of my stature and proportionsfrom competing as professional baseball players . " It is my understanding that these people now intend to launch a systematic campaign of slander against me , suggestingthat I , Bob Yamm , am not entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to every American , but rather that I am  --  and I quote  --  a gimmick , " a joke , ' a farce '  --  and what is more , that my presence on a major league diamond constitutes a disgrace ' to the game that calls itself our national pastime . Gentlemen of the press , I am sure I speak not only for myself , but for all midgets everywhere , when I say that I will not for a single moment permit these self-styled protectors of the game to deny me my rights as an American and a human being , and that I will oppose this conspiracyagainst myself and my fellow midgets with every fiber of my being . " Frank Mazuma , whose motto was " Always leave ' em laughin ' , " immediately quipped , " Every fiber of his being -- that 's sixty-five pounds worth , fellas ! "  --  and so the reporters departed once again in high spirits ; but that Yamm had made a strong claim upon their feelings was more than obvious inp192the evening 's papers . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " A credit to his size , " wrote another . " A little guy with a lot on his mind . " " Only forty inches high , but every inch a man . " One columnist , in as solemn ( and complex ) a sentence as he had ever written , asked , " Why are our brave boys fighting and dying in far-off lands , if not so that the Bob Yamms of this world can hold high their heads , midgets though they may be ? " And the following week a famous illustratorof the era penned a tribute to Yamm on the cover of Liberty magazine that was subsequently reprinted by the thousands and came to take its place on the walls of just about every barber shop in America in those war years  --  the meticulouslyrealistic drawing entitled " The Midgets ' Midget , " showingBob in his baseball togs , his famous fraction on his back , waving his little bat toward an immense cornucopia decorated with forty-eight stars ; marching out of the cornucopia are an endless stream of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life : tiny little doctors with stethoscopes , little nurses , little factory workers in overalls , little tiny professorswearing glasses and carrying little books under their arms , little policemen and firemen , and so on , each a perfect miniature of his or her fully grown counterpart . All at once  --  to the astonishment even of Frank Mazuma the entire nation took not only brave Bob Yamm to its heart , but all American midgets with him , a group previously unknown to the vast majority of their countrymen . Until Bob Yamm 's entrance into baseball , how many Americans had even taken a good long look at a midget , let alone heard one speak ? How many Americans had ever been in a midget 's house ? How many Americans had ever taken a meal with a midget , or exchanged ideas with one ? What did midgets eat anyway ? And how much ? Where did they live ? Did midgets marry , and if so , whom ? Other midgets ? Where did they go to find other midgets ? What did midgets do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these questions the ordinary , fullgrownman in the street had to confess his ignorance ; either he knew nothing whatsoever about the American midget , or what was worse , shared the general misconception that they were people of dubious morality and low intelligence , belonging to no religious order , befriended only by the sleaziest types ,  |p193and  constitutionally unable to rise in life above the station of bellhop , if that . Following the publication of that cover drawing of Bob Yamm , photo stories began to appear with almost weekly regularityin Sunday papers around the country , reporting on the valuable work that local midgets were doing , particularly in behalf of the war effort : photos of midgets with blowtorches crawling down into sections of airplane fuselage far too small for an ordinary aircraft worker to enter ; photos of midgets in munitions plants , their feet sticking up out of heavy artillery pieces according to the caption , spot-checking theweapons against sabotage prior to shipment to the front . There was even a contingent of midgets , recruited from all around the country , shown in training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces were blacked out in the photo , but there they sat , in what appeared to be a kindergarten classroom , taking instruction from a full-grown Army colonel . On the lighter side , there were photos of midgets having fun , the men dressed in tuxedos , the women in floor-length gowns , celebrating New Year 's Eve at a party complete with champagne , streamers , noisemakers , false noses , and paper hats . There was a photo story one week in the nation 's largest Sunday supplement showing a pair of married midgets at home eating a spaghetti dinner ( " Doris does the cooking usually , but spaghetti ' n meatballs is Bill 's own specialty . From the looks of that big smile  --  and even bigger portion ! it sureseems like somebody enjoys his own cooking in the Peterson household " ) and another of a midget standing in the Victory Garden out back of his house , pointing up at the corn . ( " Just growin ' like Topsy ! ' says Tom Tucker , of his prize-winning vegetable patch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , modestly chalks his outstanding harvest up to dumb luck . ' " ) What one photo story after another revealed , and what was at first so difficult for their fellow Americans to believe , was that midgets were exactly like ordinary people , only smaller . Indeed , after Mrs. Bob Yamm had appeared on Martita McGaff 's daytime radio show , the network received letters from over fifteen thousand women , congratulatingp194them for their courage in having as a guest the utterly charmingwife of the controversial little baseball player . Only a very small handful found the program distasteful , and wrote to complain that hearing a midget on the radio had frightened their young children and given them nightmares . " I only wish all of you out there in radioland , " Martita began , " could be here in the studio to see my guest today . She is Mrs. Bob Yamm , her husband is the pinch-hitter who has major league pitchers going round in circles , and she herself is cute as a button . Welcome to the show , Mrs. Yamm  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing ? I 've been admiring it since I laid eyes on you . And the little matching shoes and handbag ! I 've never seen anything so darling ! " " Thank you , Martita . Actually the sunsuit is something I designed and made myself . " " You did n't ! Well , watch out , Paris  --  there 's a little lady in Kakoola , Wisconsin , who just may run you out of business ! Have you ever thought of designing clothes specifically for women midgets , Mrs. Yamm ? Am I correct  --  it is women midgets ' ; or does one say midgetesses ' ? Our announcer and myself were talking that over just before the show , and Don says he believes he has heard the term midgetesses ' used on occasion . . . No ? " " No , " said Mrs. Yamm . " Tell me then , what do women midgets do about clothes ? I 'm sure all our listeners have wondered . Do most of them designand make their own , or are you out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you could say I was out of the ordinary in that respect , " replied Mrs. Yamm . " But since I 'm rather thin for my height , and most children 's clothes just swim on me , I took to making my own  --  I guess as a matter of necessity . " " It is the mother of invention , is n't it ? " " Yes , " agreed Mrs. Yamm . " And may I say , " said Martita , " for the benefit of our radio audience , you are marvelously thin . I 'm sure the ladies listening in , some of whom have my problem , would like to know your secret . Do you watch your diet ? "  | " No , I more or less eat whatever I want . " " And continue to remain so wonderfully petite ' ! " " Yes , " said Mrs. Yamm . " Oh , that we were all so lucky ! I just look at a dish of ice cream  --  well , let 's not go into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the wife of a famous man ? Do you find people staring at you now whenever you two step out ? " " Well , of course , they always stared , you know , even before . " " Well , I would n't doubt that . You are a darling couple . How did you meet Bob ? Is there a funny story that goes with that ? Did Bob get down on his knees to ask for your hand  --  or just how did he pop the question ? " " He just asked me if I 'd marry him . " " Not on bended knee , eh ? Not the old-fashioned type . " " No . " " And just what do you think it was that made you attractive to a man like Bob Yamm ? " " Well , my size , primarily . My being another midget . " " And a very lovely midget , if I may say for the benefit of the radio audience what Mrs. Yamm is too modest to say herself . Just to give our radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run the risk of embarrassing our guest  --  I hope she wo n't mind but coming into the studio today , for the first moment I did not even realize that she was real . I had seen photographs of her , of course , and knew she would be my guest today  --  and yet in that first moment , seeing her in that darling outfit , with matching purse and shoes , sitting straight up in the corner of my office sofa with her legs out in front of her , one demurely crossed over the other , I actually thought she was a doll ! I thought , My granddaughter Cindy has been here and she 's left her new doll . She 'll be sick , wondering where it is , such a lovely and expensive one too , with real hair and so on '  --  and then the doll 's mouth opened and said , How do you do , I 'm Judy Yamm . ' Well , you 're blushing , but it 's true . I was literally and truly in wonderland for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yamm was , when he first laid eyes upon you . " " Thank you . " " Was it love at first sight for you , too ? Did you ever ex/pect when you first met him that Bob would be a major league baseball player ? " " No , I did n't . " " What a thrill then for two young people who only a few months ago thought of themselves as just an ordinary Americancouple . By the way , are there any little Yamms at home ? " " Pardon ? Oh , no  --  just Bob and myself . " " Uh-oh , I 'm being told to cut it short , time for only one more question  --  so at the risk of being as ultracontroversial as your ultracontroversial husband , Bob Yamm , brilliant pinchhitterfor the Kakoola Reapers , I 'm going to ask it . Do you think a midget can ever get to be President of the United States ? Now you do n't have to answer that one . " " I think I wo n't . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me say that I 've been talking to a midget who could certainly get to be First Lady in my book  --  and that is the utterly delightful and charming and beautiful Judy Yamm , wife of the famous baseballstar , and clothes designer in her own right  --  and I only hope our granddaughter Cindy is n't waiting outside here , becauseone look at you , Judy Yamm , and she 's going to want to take you home for her own ! This is Martha McGaff  --  have a happy , everyone ! " The enthusiasm that Bob Yamm had generated around the nation took even the audacious Frank Mazuma by surprise , and though the owner continued to delight the fans by making unscheduled appearances on the stadium roof when Yamm came to bat , he let it be known to the press that of course his high-powered rifle was loaded only with blanks ; in public , he even stopped referring to Bob as " Squirt " and " Runt , " allowing the fans to enjoy the midget however they liked . If they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty inches high , that was their business  --  especially as it was good for business . In fact , when a midget a full three inches shorter than Yamm turned up at Mazuma 's office one day , claiming to be a right-handed pitcher , Mazuma promptly pulled a catcher 's mitt out of his desk drawer and took him down beneath the stands for a tryout . The following ( lay , ap197new name was added to the Reaper roster : No. 1/2 , O.K. Ockatur . For a week , Ockatur sat alone in a corner of the Reaper dugout , pounding his little glove and muttering to himself what were taken at the time to be analyses of the weaknesses of the opposing batsmen . Then the Mundys arrived in town direct from a series in Asylum , and the right-hander climbed down off the Reaper bench , and with his curious rolling gait  --  for he was not so perfectly formed as Yamm , nor so handsome either  --  made his way out to the mound , where he pitched a four-hit shutout . Using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually dragging his knuckles in the dust , and then released the ball on a rising trajectory , so that it was still climbing through the strike zone when it passed the batter . " Why , I never seen nothin ' like it , " said Wayne Heket . " That little boy out there , or whatever he is , was throwin ' up at us . " " The mountain climber , " some called the Ockatur pitch ; " the skyrocket , " " the upsydaisy "  --  and as for Ockatur 's right arm , inevitably it was dubbed " the ack-ack gun , " and with characteristic wartime enthusiasm little No. 1/2 was labeled " Kakoola 's Secret Weapon "  --  until the players around the league got the knack of laying into that odd , ascending pitch , and began to send it out of the ball park , " where , " said the writers , who were n't fooled for too long either , " it belonged to begin with . " What caused the disenchantment , when it came , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred of all men taller than himself , including Bob Yamm . At the outset , his refusal to be photographed shaking Yamm 's hand on the steps of the Reaper dugout had startled those who had drawn around , in a spirit of good cheer , to observe the historic event . Visibly shaken by the rebuff , Yamm had nonetheless told the reporters present that he understood perfectly why Mr. Ockatur had turned away in a huff ; in fact , he admired him for it ! " What O.K. Ockatur has made clear , gentlemen , and in no uncertain terms , is that he has no intention of walkingin Bob Yamm 's shadow . " And , in the face of increasingly blatant provocations , Bob continued to conduct himself as he hard earlier with li'rank Mazuina , when the Reaper owner would do whatever he could to get a laugh out of Bob 's size : hep198ignored him , and went about his job , which was to draw bases on balls as a pinch-hitter . Only with an adversary like Ockatur , it required a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a clown who invariably could be counted on to compromise himself by his own exceedingly bad taste , Ockatur was a crazed and indefatigable enemy , who despised him and attacked him with all the ingrained bitterness of a man who is not only a midget by normal standards , but an exceedingly short person even by the standards of the average midget . Though it was not a word Bob himself would ever have used either publicly or privately to describe Ockatur , in the end he had silently to agree with Judy , when she broke down crying one night at dinner , and called Ockatur , who was trying her husband to the breaking point , " nothing but a dirty little dwarf . " If Ockatur came to seem to the Yamms and to the press an insult to the good name of midgets everywhere , to Ockatur , Bob Yamm seemed the last man in the world to bear the title of " the midgets ' midget . " The sight of Yamm wearing a smaller number than his own made him wild with anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , if Yamm was Number 1/4 , then he should be 1/8 , if not 1/10 ! He was the shorter of the two , and with his oversized head and bandy legs , was far more representative of the average little person than this perfectly proportioned , well-spoken , college-educated , smartly dressed , " courageous , " " dignified , " forty-inch fraternity-boy Adonis , with his spic-and-span Kewpie-doll of a wife ! Oh how he hated the kind of midget who went around pretending that he was nothing but a smaller edition of everybody else ! who wanted no more than " an even break like everybody else " ! As if it were possible for a midget 's life to be anything but a trial and a nightmare ! As if it were possible sitting in a high chair in a restaurant eating your dinner to feel like " everybody else , " while as a matter of fact " everybody else " was either lookingthe other way in disgust , or openly staring in wonder . And that , only if the management would seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no room , to somebody who weighs only fifty-five pounds and could take his dinner in the phone booth ! And what about phone booths ? What about having to ask the policeman on his beat if he will be kind enough top199pick you up so you can dial  --  is that like " everybody else , " Bob Yamm ? Is it like " everybody else " to go into a public urinal and stand on tiptoes at the trough , while " everybody else " is pissing over your shoulder ? And what about the movie show , where either you sit in the front row and look straight up at figures that loom over you even worse than in life , or you go all the way to the back , to the last row , and stand there on your seat  --  if the usher will permit . Ushers  --  those compassionate souls ! And what about doorknobs , Bob ? What about stairways ! Turnstiles ! Water coolers ! Is there a single object that a midget confronts in this entire world that does not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , you , you 're the wrong size . " An even break like everybody else ! Oh , that 's whose midget Bob Yamm was , all right  --  everybody else 's ! And that 's whose midget he wanted to be , too ! Is it any wonder then that on the afternoon they were to be photographed shaking hands outside the Reaper dugout , Ockaturmuttered at Yamm that insult of midget argot ordinarilyapplied to the so-called normal-sized people ? Chin to chin , looking into Yamm 's clear , kind blue eyes , Ockatur snarled , " I did n't know they piled shit that high ! " then turned and angrily walked  --  waddled , alas , would be a more accurate description  --  down into the Reaper clubhouse , leaving Bob to interpret Ockatur 's appalling behavior in what he hoped would be the best interest of their mutual cause . OCKATUR , YAMM IN DUGOUT SLUGFEST ; BRAWLING MIDGETS DRAW SUSPENSION , FINE FROM MAZUMA ; PINCH-HIT STAR ADMITS GUILT , ADDS : " THIS CLUB NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLLYWOOD FILMS LIFESept. 14  --  The much-feared volcano the Reapers have been worryingover privately for two weeks erupted yesterday in the team dugout , when the first two midgets in baseball , pinch-hitter Bob Yamm and pitcher O.K. Ockatur , came to blows . Yamm was just about to leave the Reaper dugout to pinch-hit against Asylum in the eighth I Asylum won the game 5-4 , tumbling the Reapers into seventh place . See story p. 43 when a remark from Ockatur sparked the feud that has been developing between the two sincep200the midget pitcher joined the Reapers in the stretch drive for sixth . Following the bloody battle , both players were taken by ambulance to Kakoola Memorial for treatment of cuts and bruises . Would Suspend PopeOwner Frank Mazuma promptly slapped a one hundred dollarfine and a ten-day suspension on each player for " conductunbecoming a Reaper . " Mazuma said : " Of course it 's going tohurt the club . If Bob had walked yesterday he would haveforced in the tying run and we might well be in sixth right now , where we belong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mazuma replied with some salty language when asked if hewould have meted out such punishment to the players if eitherhad been " someone your own size . " " It strikes me , " said anangry Mazuma , " as somewhat odd that the guy who has singlehandedlylifted the barrier against midgets should now be accusedof picking on them because they happen to be small . I don'tcare if they were giants . Throw a punch in my dugout , and Ido n't care if you are the Pope himself , out you go on yourIn the Vatican , sources close to the Pontiff said the Holy Father had not yet been informed of Mazuma 's remark . Photo story on local Catholic reaction , pro and con , p. 7 . Brilliant MidgetsNo one knows yet what exactly passed between the two players as Yamm was moving out of the dugout to pinch-hit against the Keepers with the bases loaded and one out . Accordingto other players , ever since Ockatur came up and began his brilliant winning streak  --  3  --  0 to date he has been needling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swing away . In the fifteen times he came to bat prior to his suspension , Yamm had not swung at a pitched ball . To date there have been only three strikes called against the forty-inch-high pinch-hitter , each coming in a different game . His fifteen consecutive bases on balls already exceed the old major league record by seven . Second VolcanoThe second volcano erupted in Kakoola  --  and the nation  --  at exactly 9 : 07 P.M. Central Daylight Saving Time , when Bob Yammp201went on station KALE to read to Reaper fans the letter which he had just sent by special messenger to owner Frank Mazuma . See back page for photo story on midget messenger and his reactions . Yamm appeared at the studio with a bandaged head and hand , accompanied by his wife , Judith . Both were dressed in the style they have made a nationwide fad in only a matter of weeks . Bob wore his famous gray double-breasted pin-striped suit , and Mrs. Yamm a monogrammed yellow sunsuit , with matching yellow purse , shoes , and hair barrette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dab at her face with a yellow handkerchief when her husband read the final paragraph of his prepared statement . See story " Grown Men Weep " for reaction of studio technicians to Yamm Farewell Speech , p. 9 . The Farewell AddressThe following is the complete text of the Yamm speech , as broadcast over KALE : Good evening . I am Bob Yamm . I have in the past hour sent a letter to Mr. Frank Mazuma , owner of the Kakoola Reapers , which I shall now read to you in its entirety . Dear Mr. Mazuma : I want to tell you that I am wholly to blame for the violent incident that occurred this afternoon at 3:56 P.M. , as I was leaving the dugout to pinch-hit against the Asylum Keepers . In the five hours that have elapsed since , I have remained silent as to my responsibility , and have thus caused a great injustice to be visited upon my teammate O.K. Ockatur . No ExcuseI have no more excuse to make for this unconscionable delay than for the incident itself . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time to collect my thoughts , I would be reporting only a fraction of the truth . I fear that it was unjustifiable anger , and a cowardly fear of the consequences , that served to seal both my lips and O.K. Ockatur 's fate . In Anguish Since Five-ThirtyI was discharged from the hospital at 5:14 P.M. , clinging still to my self-righteous attitude and fully intending to maintainmy silence . I will tell you now that my conscience has not given me a moment 's peace since 5 : 30 when I returned home , and , in anguish , heard the news bulletin announcing your decision to punish O.K. Ockatur and myself ' equally . That I allowed three hours niul IWI ) minutes more to intervene between your pressp202conference and my decision to come on the air ( reached at 8 : 32 C.D.S.T. ) , is , I fear , yet another black mark against my integrity . Keeps Pitchers HonestMr . Mazuma , it will not do any longer to intimate  --  if only by my silence  --  that even if I am responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame because of the burdens I have borne since entering the big leagues . I do not wish to minimize the difficulties and hardships that must befall any man who is a pioneer in his field . I mean rather to suggest that the pressures  --  and the prejudices  --  that I have had to withstand as the first midget in baseball , have been as nothing beside those under which my teammate and fellow midget , O.K. Ockatur , has had to labor . That there might one day be a midget pinch-hitting in the big leagues had long ago occurred to baseball men , if only as a " funny " idea , a curiosity to draw fans to the ball park . Moreover , on the basis of the thousands of letters I have received from midgets around the country since joining the Reapers , I think I can safely say that this dream of a midget pinch-hitter , who one day would stand at home plate testing the control of the best pitchers in the game , has been a secret ambition of American midgets from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from full-grown baseball fans , who write to wish me well , and to say that the presence of a midget in the batter 's box may well be what is necessary to prevent big league pitching from deteriorating any further  --  to keep the pitchers , as they like to put it , " honest . " And many of these correspondents are fans who admit to having scoffed at the idea just a short month ago . Unfortunately , they continue to scoff at the idea of a midget on the mound . Victorious though he has been in three consecutive outings , in many ways the spark plug of the Reaper drive on sixth , O.K. Ockatur continues to remain to many something less than a major league pitcher . Sad to say , in their estimations he is still " a freak . " Outstanding FreaksYes , " freak " is the word that some Americans will use to describe a man whose style of pitching is his own and no one else 's , a man who is unusual , unorthodox  --  in a word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own man , if to pursue excellence and accomplishment with all that is unique to your being is whatp203is meant by " a freak , " then I guess O.K. Ockatur is a freak , all right . And so too , I submit , were the Founding Fathers of this country , so too were the great Greek philosophers , so too were the lonely geniuses who invented the wheel , the steam engine , the cotton gin , and the airplane . And so too is every hero in history who has lived and died by his own lights . But perhaps what makes O.K. Ockatur " a freak " is n't his unyielding individualism , but the determination he has displayedin the face of every conceivable obstruction , his courage in the face of the most heartbreaking adversity . Yes , perhaps it is his bravery that makes him " a freak "  --  perhaps it is that to which the fans are paying tribute , when they lean over the dugoutroof and cry , " Hey it is a midget  --  I thought it was a monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsigned of course , in which they tell him to go back to the sideshow . Well , that must be some sideshow , including as it does such freaks as George Washington , Abraham Lincoln , Socrates , the Wright Brothers , and Thomas Alva Edison  --  in short , every man who has ever dared to pit himself against the ingrained habits and customs of his time , who has dared to brave the jeers of the rabble , the envy of the cowardly , the smugness of the complacent , the sarcasm of the know-it-alls , and the unremitting opposition of the vested interests . Fails All But DogMr . Mazuma , knowing as I did the extent of the abuse and ridicule that have been O.K. Ockatur 's daily fare since arriving in the big leagues , knowing too how even the most proud and independent of men may come to be poisoned by such venom , it was surely incumbent upon me to be understanding , if not forgiving , of his stronger moods . Surely it was not too much to ask that I overlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remission where another might condemn . But I failed him , at the very moment that he most needed a friendly smile , a kind remark , a brotherly gesture of solidarity . I failed him , and failed as well : my wife ; my teammates ; you , Mr. Mazuma ; the Patriot League ; General Oakhart ; Judge Landis ; organized baseball ; midgets throughout the country , many of them in importantwar work ; those everywhere who have supported the midget in his drive for equal opportunities ; and , last but not least , our soldiers across the Atlantic and the Pacific , hundreds of whom have written asking for autographed photos of me at the plate . I do n't think it is an exaggeration to say that . I failed everyonep204everywhere , regardless of faith , creed , color , or size , who has clung to the vision of a better world , even as this bloody war rages on . And , of course , most unforgivable of all , I have failed myself . Though it may seem insensitive of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the only one I seem not to have failed is my chihuahua pup , Pinch-hit , who has sat in my lap all the while I have been composing this letter , blissfully ignorant of the fact that his master is not the same man today that he was yesterday , and that he will never be again . Bows OutMr . Mazuma , I fear that my usefulness to the Reapers has come to an end . Much as I continue to respect O.K. Ockatur as an athlete and a man , I can not expect that , following today 's atrociousepisode , we two will ever be able to resolve our difficulties amicably . And surely the last thing our team needs , in the midst of a battle for sixth , is a smoldering battle simultaneously taking place on the bench , between an occasional pinch-hitter and a startingpitcher who has not yet lost a game in the majors . Nor do I think it would be in the interests of O.K. Ockatur himself , if I were to remain with the Reapers as his teammate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here will cause you to rescind , or even mitigate , the punishment you have leveled upon O.K. , perhaps that may repair to some degree the damage that I have done his reputation . But I do not really believe there is any way to meet his justifiable sense of grievance , or fully to restore his manly dignity , short of my departure from the club . Great WifeBecause of " the gentleman 's agreement " that as we all know continues to exist among the other clubs , leaving the Reapersis of course tantamount for me to retirement from big league baseball . I only regret that I , who entered the drama of this great game so auspiciously , find myself exiting in disgrace . To be absolutely frank , for almost a week now , I have felt an increasingstrain , and had begun to worry for my self-control . So too did my wife Judy , who I want to say now , has been a tower of strength right from the day I signed my Kakoola contract . Even though she dreaded the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic life , she knew that I would never be able to count myself a man if I refused to accent the challenge to break down the big league barrier against midgets.  |p205However  , as each day she saw more and more evidence of my mental and moral faltering , she could not help but become alarmed , and only yesterday , fearful of just such an incident as erupted this afternoon , begged me to remain at home and take a rest . Unfortunately , I did not heed her wifely wisdom , and told her that I owed it to the club to continue to play , regardless of my own inner turmoil . Had I the humility to have heeded Judy 's advice , a good deal of suffering would have been spared us all . But I would be less than honest if I suggested that it was ever within my power to relinquish a single second of the experience of being a big leaguer . Mr. Mazuma , the time has come for Bob Yamm to bow out of the great game of baseball , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these three weeks that I have worn the Kakoola uniform , I have been , not merely the happiest midget , but the happiest man on the face of the earth . Sincerely , Robert YammAll Men MidgetsYamm concluded his radio address with an appeal for " human solidarity and brotherhood under God , Our Maker . " " I say Our ' Maker , " he continued , " though as we all know there are those in this country who would still have us believe that He who made the full-grown did not make the midget also . Well , let me assure these skeptics , that ever since my own Hour of Crisis began in the Reaper dugout at 3 : 56 P.M. Central Daylight Saving Time , I have heard His Voice , and it is not runty or pint-sized ; let me assure the skeptics that He Who exhorts , chastens , and comforts me is not less a God , nor is He any other God , than He Who made and judges the fully grown . On high , there is but one God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are midgets . " Overwhelming ReactionReactions to Yamm 's forty-two-minute address began coming in from around the nation almost immediately  --  sports authoritiescannot remember another athlete who off the playing field has so captivated the country . Reaper owner Mazuma called Yamm 's speech " certainly one of the top ten farewell addresses I 've ever heard and just possibly the greatest in history . " Maztnnadeclined to comment further at this time , except to say , " Whether it will he Fob 's swan song remains to be seen . The fans are yet , to he heard from . " See story on fan mail , " Christmasin September at Kakoola P.O. , " p. 26.  |p206Meanwhile  a movement has gotten underway overnight to send Bob Yamm to Congress in the next elections . Republican and Democratic spokesmen declined to comment until Yamm makes known his party affiliation , but interest was more than apparentin the headquarters of both parties here . The sentiment seems to be that perhaps the time is ripe to send a midget to Washington . " The tragedy of it , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unidentified , " is that the midgets themselves have always lived scattered about , singly and in pairs around the country , and frankly have n't shown much political savvy . I 'm sure they 've had other things to worry about , but banded together there 's no doubt they would have had one of their own kind in the House long ago . Whether full-grown citizenswill elect a midget to represent them in Congress remains to be seen . Up until tonight I would have had to say no . With Yamm 's speech , it 's a new ballgame . He just could go all the way . " From Hollywood comes word that three major film companiesare already bidding for the movie rights to the Bob Yamm story . Talk in the film capital has it that Bob and Judy Yamm will agree to play themselves for one million dollars , with Bob writing the screenplay , to be called " All Men Are Midgets . " Part of the proceeds from the projected film are already earmarked to charitable organizations that aid needy and aged midgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from Mrs. Angela Whittling Trust , owner of the Tri-City Tycoons , currentlyin first place in the Patriot League . Mrs. Trust is the outspoken widow of Spenser Trust , who forged Tri-City dynastiesin baseball and banking . Of those owners opposed to midgets in the majors , Mrs. Trust has been the most unyielding and vociferous . Newsmen were called to her underground apartment in Tycoon Park at 11:00 P.M. , where Mrs. Trust , 72 , read the followingstatement from her wheelchair . Her hip was broken July 4 , when she failed in her attempt to field a foul ball lined at her box . Nix on Siamese " I never heard such rubbish in my life , " Mrs. Trust 's statementbegan . " Just who does he think he is ? This Mr. Bob Yamm has delusions of grandeur that would be offensive in a ' Fri-Cityp207Tycoon , but are utterly bizarre in a player who has pinch-hit a dozen times for a team battling to stay out of seventh , and is a midget besides , with no more business in the major leagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell Frank Mazumathat Angela Trust is against Siamese twins too , in case he was planning to bring a pair of them up as a switch-hitter . I know , I am a terrible old New England biddy with a closed mind and the rest of that poppycock , but if Mr. Mazuma 's Reapers come to Tri-City , Mass. , with a shortstop and a second-baseman who are joined back to back , he will find the door to the visitors ' clubhouse locked . I will forfeit the game , I would forfeit the pennant , rather than subject my team to any more of his shenanigans . Calls Yamm Swiss " Unfortunately , " the Angela Trust statement continued , " what we are witnessing in this country is what I would describeas an outburst of war hysteria . Suddenly anything goes . People are desperate for diversion . Reading the battlefront news I can not say that I blame them . American women are in tears and can not sleep . Families are separated , husbands and fathers and sons are gone . The strongest ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to accustom ourselves to their absence . What could be harder I No wonder the nation appears to be losing its sense of proportion . Who would have believed just one month ago that two ill-tempered midgets dressed up in children 's uniforms , with absurd fractions on their backs , would fall to brawlingin a major league baseball dugout  --  and then , and then , that one of them would go on the radio for a special broadcast , to bow out of baseball as though he were the King of England abdicating the throne . Yes , a country at war hungers for distractions of a strange sort , but I ask you , my fellow Americans : how much of this strangeness are we built for ? We must maintain standards ! We must return to our senses ! We must not account a man great ' who is nothing more than a presumptuous self-seeking midget with an elephantine sense of his own importance , cashing in during a time of national catastrophe . Truly , I have never in my life heard such cornstarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , you would think Mr. Yamm 's conscience was as delicately made as a five hundred dollar Swiss watch . You would think that nobody had a conscience in the world before he appeared at the microphone , with his perfect . little wheels whirring away underneath that pretentious little pin-striped suit !  |p208Sorry  for Midgets " Of course I 'm delighted he 's out of baseball , " Mrs. Trust continued . " Good riddance . And his wife with him . Frankly , no baseball wife has ever given me a bigger pain in the neck than this one with her matching shoes and handbags . Tower of strength ' ? Little fashion plate is all she is . Little clotheshorse . A Shetland pony in a child 's sunsuit . In this business , the towers of strength are the men on the field . That 's why they are there . That 's what people pay good money to see . It just will not do to start calling things what they are not . We do not need any more applesauce than there already is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sorry for them that that has to be the case . I would not wish to be one myself . It must be ghastly . If it were up to me , there would n't be any midgets in the world at all . But for some reason that is beyond my understanding , there are , and there is no sense pretendingotherwise . As I said , luckily I happen not to be one , but if I were , I assure you I would know my place and have pride enough to make the best of it . And without whining , or what is even worse , going to the opposite extreme and pretending I was some special kind of saint because of it . That is what a tower of strength would do , in my judgment . Wo n't See Hubby Belittled " Finally , I will not sit silently by while this sanctimonious , self-inflated , self-admiring , holier-than-thou , stuck-on-himself windbag of a midget announces to the entire country that in his opinion and God 's , all men are midgets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . All men are not midgets . My husband , Mr. Spenser Trust , who built Trust Savings and Loan , Trust Guaranty Trust , Trust Mutual of Tri-City , as well as the Tri-City Tycoons and Tycoon Park , all before he died at the age of sixty-three , was not a midget in any sense of the word . Nor was my father a midget . He began life as a lumberjack at the age of twelve and by the time he was thirty-five was the greatest timber baron in North America . If the rest of the women in America want to sit idly by while someone calls their men a bunch of midgets , that is their affair . Maybe they know something I do n't . But nobody belittles my father or my husband and gets away with it . " The day after Bob Yamtn 's dramatic broadcast stunned Kakoola and the nation , the Mundys arrived ir- town . So rat/tied were the Reapers by the unlikely events of the preceding afternoon and evening , that the Mundys piled up more runs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edging Kakoola 6  --  5 in the ninth . Roland Agni hit two home runs , bringing his season total to thirty-three ( most by a Mundy in a single season since Gofannon ) , and with one on and two out in the last inning , Bud Parusha set a record of his own , lofting the first and only home run he or any other one-armed man would ever hit in the majors . Of course there was a stiff late afternoon breeze blowing in off the lake and out the left-field line , and the Kakoola left-fielder also helped to turn into a four-bagger what should have been an easy out by tipping the high pop-up off his mitt and into the stands  --  and then too the pitch Parusha swung at was described later by the disgusted Kakoola catcher , Ducky Rig , as " a Lady Godiva ball , " meaningit had absolutely nothing on it at all ; yet none of this did anything to diminish the joy in Bud 's heart . Obviously under the sway of Bob Yamm 's radio address of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiest man on the face of the earth , and then beaming with pride , showed them the telegramthat had arrived in the visitors ' clubhouse from Washington , D.C. , signed " Eleanor Roosevelt , " and inviting him to be co-chairman along with her husband of the upcoming drive for the March of Dimes . The Kakoola fans , no less distracted than their players , seemed for the moment not even to care about the loss that pushed their team yet another full game behind the Keepers . I t was not to watch the seventh place Reapers take on the eighth place Mundys that a record-breaking forty-two thousandhad assembled in Reaper Field on a weekday afternoon  --  rather , they had come , some from as far as two hundred miles upstate , to see justice done . For nine full innings of play , whenever the Reapers came t o hat , the fans began their voodoo-like chant . No wonder Jolly ( ' holly , throwing his usual wastebasket full of trash , was able to set the Reapers down looking inning after inning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise assaulting their eardrums when they stepped up to the plate , hut the Reapers , for all that they were the property of showmanFrank Mazuu-a , and might have been expected to he some/what more inured to the outlandish , seemed actually to fall into a state of hypnosis when the fans started in calling for the return of their hero . Ptah passed balls ( two ) , Tuminikar wild pitches ( two ) , Mundy fielding errors ( five ) were as nothing to the transfixed Reaper offense when forty thousand voices set the ball park to rumbling like the heart of a volcano : " YAMM ! YAMM ! YAMM ! YAMM ! YAMM ! YAMM ! YAMM ! " Starvingsavages invoking their potato god for an abundant crop could not have offered up a more impassioned and sustained cry of yearning . And by nightfall , the deity had delivered . " The fans have spoken , " announced Mazuma , his one piratical eye agleam . " As of six o'clock this evening , Bob Yamm , the Midgets ' Midget and now the People 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , in a straight player deal , O.K. Ockatur has been traded to the Ruppert Mundys for slugging outfielderBud Parusha . " Those sportswriters who hated him of course derided Mazuma for compounding one cruel , corrupt publicity stunt with another . Clearly Mazuma had acquired Parusha  --  and in the process unloaded the washed-up dwarf  --  because of the telegram that had converted the Mundy right-fielder from a baseball curiosity into a symbol of courage on a par with the paralyzed President . And even more clearly , the telegram purportedlyfrom Mrs. Roosevelt had been composed in his own front office by Mazuma and dispatched by some low-down pal of his in the nation 's capital . . . or so whispered his enemies , who claimed that it was only to spare the feelings of poor Bud Parusha that the First Lady , justifiably outraged , had nonetheless decided to allow the telegram to stand as her own  --  exactly as Mazuma had predicted to his cronies the tenderheartedEleanor would behave ! Admittedly , the name Parusha had once been to the Patriot League what Waner was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was before Angelo and Tony , the Joe and Dom , the Big and Little Poison of the Tycoon outfield , went off to the wars ; surely a woman as well informed as Mrs. Roosevelt understood that if Bud Parusha 's presence in the big time symbolized anything , it was only the awful depths to which the depleted leagues hadp211fallen . Still , she held her tongue . Oh , that God damn Mazuma ! He would even go so far as to shit on Eleanor Roosevelt and the March of Dimes in order to make himself a buck ! To fill the right-field slot left vacant by the departure of Bud Parusha , Mister Fairsmith had now to look to his bench , and like schoolchildren who had not done their homework , Mokos , Omara , Skirnir , Terminus , Hunaman , Khovaki , Kronos , and Garuda looked the other way . Said Mister Fairsmith 's emissary , Jolly Cholly T. , " All right , who wants to play right field ? " and the eight , whom he had called together in the visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , " said Cholly , " you boys are forty and fifty years old . When will you ever get a chance like this again ? Do n't you want to have somethin ' to tell your grandchildren about ? " he asked , figuring this last might have some appeal , in that all of the Mundy utility players were proud , doting grandfathers , who passed much of their time on the bench exchangingsnapshots of their offsprings ' offspring , while their less fortunate teammates were out on the field being beaten to a pulp . " Come on , Mule , " said Cholly to Mokos , a great glove man with the Greenbacks prior to their scandalous demise , " think how proud little Mickey would be to see your name in the box score every day . Think how he could say to his schoolchums , That 's my Grampa out there ! ' Now how many kids can do that ? " " Cholly , " said Mokos , sighing , " God knows I 'd like to help you . But frankly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suit me . " " Suppose I say you can sit down , Mule . Suppose I say you can sit down on the grass and rest up whenever there 's an intentional pass or a new pitcher comes in to warm up . Now you know with us that can be as much as two , three times an i n n i n ' late in the game , and that 's exactly when you 'd be needin ' it most . " The old , tired M ule shoot : his head . " Sorry , Cholly , I 'll sit here on the bench I'or you , and watch these games every afternoon , even though the truth he known , I got . one a thousand andp212one things back home I could do better with my time  --  but to be perfectly frank with you , I 'll be darned if I 'm going to stand to watch a ballgame , especially when one of the teams is a last-place club fifty games out of first . I got ta be honest with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to start pullin ' our punches at a time like this . " Cholly turned next to Clever Carl Khovaki . " Ca n't hear you , Cholly . " " I said , " shouted the Mundy coach , " how would you like to play right field on a regular basis ? " " Write to who about the bases ? I ca n't but sign my name with a X , you know that . " " No , play right field on a regular basis . " " Me ? " bellowed Carl , and broke into a big smile . " You must be kiddin ' . Ca n't hear . " " You do n't have to hear ! " shouted Cholly . " Just field and hit ! " " Ca n't hear , though . Ca n't hear the crowd . Ca n't hear the ball bein ' struck . Ca n't hear Agni if he calls for me to catch it . " Then , with that wonderful ability to laugh at himself that had made him the beloved dunderhead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ca n't even hear myself think . That 's how come I give it up . " It was true : even in his heyday with Aceldama , though he could regularly drive a high hard one into the seats , Carl would be as apt to run back to first as on to third , if someone hit a single while he was on second . In the thick of things he seemed to have no more idea as to how the game was played than a Saudi Arabian . Then he went deaf and lost what little contact he had with those who could holler and scream at him what to do next  --  and then he became a Mundy . " Get a feller can hear , Cholly , that 's my advice . That is , " said Carl , " if we got one on the club . Otherwise my advice is buy one , and the hell with the price . Should be one of us ai n't hard of hearin ' anyway , just in case of some kind of emergency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " somebody has got to play right field on this club , and it ai n't me . I an already pitcher , coach , mother , and father around here , and that 's enough . " " Well , " snapped Wally Omara , " it ai n't Inc , either ! Let 's get that clear . Not with my blood pressure no , sir ! If wep213had even a shot at seventh , well , that would be a arguin ' point , Cholly . But we ai n't got a shot at shit as far as I can see , and in the light of that , I really am flabbergasted that you have had the raw nerve , Charles , to even suggest to a feller with my blood pressure  --  " " And you ? " asked Cholly , turning to Applejack Terminus , who was sitting off by himself , as though nursing some private misery . " Cholly , " said Applejack , looking sadly down at the belly bulging over his belt , " Cholly , if I could still go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up , I 'd be out there for you every afternoon for the rest of the month . But , " said the Apple , closing his eyes against the tears , " them days is gone , Cholly . " " Suppose I say you do n't have to go back , Apple . Suppose I say you can play up against the wall , so you only have to come in . " " Cholly , " said Terminus , " ai n't nobody ca n't catch ' em comin ' Why , that 's a insult ! " " But I ai n't even sayin ' catch ' em , Apple . Let ' em drop in for singles and take ' em on the hop . And we 'll call that playin ' right field . What do you say , fella ? " " Cholly , " he moaned , again struggling not to weep , " in my prime , Cholly , when I was playin ' center for the Blues , there was times I covered second on account of how close in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seen it . You seen where the smart fans used to sit back in them days when I was with the Blues  --  right out there in the bleachers ! And not just paupers either , but millionaires with their chauffeurs . And why ? ' Cause they knew . You want to watch a ace outfielder like Apple ply his trade , why , that 's the only place to sit  --  right back of him ! Yessir ! And then watch him go when that ball is hit ! Just watch him ! But then a ' course , " said Apple , suddenly bitter , " then a ' course they put that rabbit in the hall , did n't they ? That 's what moved us back a ' course  --  and rained the whole gosh darn game ! Hell , I remember the first time this feller struck a triple over my head with that new hill a ' theirs . Can't. even recall his name no more  --  I do n't think lie lasted in the big time but fifteen minutes . Anyhow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of 1930 . Know whatI did ? I WitS so dun ; uuul , I did n't even bother to throw thatp214ball in from center , nosir ; I ran all the way to the infield , holdin ' that new ball a ' theirs in my hand , see , and I run all the way up to that hoofenpoofer , who was a smilin ' away to beat the band on third there , as though he had done somethin ' special , you understand , and I said , Listen , you sorry excuse of a whangdoodle , last year you could n't a hit the ball above your waist if we give it to you to hold in your hand ! " Oh no ? ' says that grinnin ' gaboon , then how come I done it just now , Apple ? ' How come ? ' says I. Here 's how come ! ' And I ripped off his cap and stuck that ball right up to his ear : Joss listen , you wampus cat , juss hold that right up to yer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hear that rabbit 's heart abeatin ' away in there ! ' " And on and on went the fat man , fifteen minutes more on the subject that invariably threw him into a tirade  --  the introduction twenty-odd years earlier of the lively ball . " Nope , " he concluded , spitting on the clubhouse floor to register his vote , " the day I have to rest my fanny on the fence , that is the day I bow out of this game for good . Either you play the outfield shallow , Cholly , like it was meant to be played back before the era of the stitched golf ball , or you do n't play it at all ! " In the end it was the undernourished six-footer , skinny Specs Skirnir , the Mundy with a year of college education and the least confident of them all , who took the job . " I just do n't want to break my glasses , Cholly . " " You wo n't , Specs . " " I 'm not used to them yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Specs , you 've had ' em since ' 34 . " " I know , Cholly , but I just ca n't get used to them . " " Well , it may just be a matter of playin ' with ' em regular . That may do it for you , boy . " " But what happens when they get steamed up ? " " Just take ' em off and clean ' em with your hankie . " " What if it 's in the middle of a play , Cbolly ? " " Do it before the play . " " But they do n't get steamed up before . They get steamed up during . " " Well , then , " said ( Holly , patiently , " do the best you can , and clean ' em after . "  | " But of ten 's too late ! What if because they 're steamed up I ca n't see  --  and get hit with the ball ! Suppose I 'm at bat and get hit in the mouth ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all because my glasses got steamed up ! " " Ah , come on , Specs , none of that 's goin ' to happen . It has n't yet . " " That 's because since I got them in 1934 I 've been benched ! And even with that they get steamed ! Look , look how I chipped my tooth on the water fountain in Independence . My glasses got steamed up on account of the heat , and I went in too close for a drink , and I chipped my tooth on the spout . Look , Cholly , look at my shins , they 're all black and blue  --  tripped over Big Jawn 's foot just going down to the clubhouse in Terra Inc. to take a leak . Imagine  --  just taking a leak is dangerous in these damn things ! Cholly , I should n't even really be in the dugout during the game , let alone on the field ! Nine innings just on the bench and at the end of the game I 'm a wreck ! If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot shower , I ache in every muscle for a week ! Cholly , this is crazy  --  this is insane ! I do n't get what 's going on around here at all . I 've been to school , Cholly , and I can tell you this much  --  you do n't trade away a perfectly decent one-armed outfielder to put in his place a guy who wears glasses . What kind of baseball strategy is that ? And look what we got in return , Charles  --  a dwarf ! It was n't bad enough to have Chico with that awful squeak of his , now we got to have a twisted little dwarf coming in out of the bullpen for the grand finale every afternoon ! Cholly , I do n't like it ! Nine years now , Cholly , one way or . another , I 've managed to stay alive wearing these God damnhi ngs  --  and now suddenly this crazy little dwarf shows up to help us finish last , and I 'm supposed to take my life in my hands playing in glasses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-three years old ! " " Specs , " said Cholly , laying a fatherly hand upon the sopping uniform of the terrified utility player on the brink of becoming a regular again , " I have just spent a mornin ' here goin ' over this club 's reserve strength , and if it 'll be any comfort to you , I do n't believe this here is a big league team any more , in the original way that they meant that word . " " Well , maybe we ai n't a big league team , but we 're play/ing against big league teams  --  and , Cholly , that 's what 's scariestof all ! " After a moment 's reflection , Cholly said , " I suppose that is what 's scariest , come to think of it . Still and all , we got ta do it , " and he entered Specs Skirnir on the line-up card for that day 's game . " You 're battin ' seventh , son . And do n't forget your hankie . " Query : Who back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the players knew , the paneled , carpeted stadium offices of the Mundy management had been turned over to the Army , along with the beautifully manicured field , and the patriotic Mundy brothers had rented for the duration a nondescript cubbyhole in a rundown office building at the very edge of Port Ruppert 's colored section . According to one of the rumors with which the players around the league liked to tease and taunt the Mundys , the office was tended only by an old woolly-haired janitor who came in to raise and lower the blackout shade each day , and to forward whatever mail had accumulated on to the exotic cities of Latin America , where the Mundy brothers were said to be recuperating from the hard winter of negotiation that had landed their ball club on the road . " Hey , " said Big John , laughing as usual , " maybe the nigger done it . Maybe Mazuma called when he was sweepin ' up , and the nigger said , Okay wiff me , boss , ' and hung up . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nigger janitor back in Rupe-it swapped you even up for a fella the size of a mosquito ! " " Hey , would that be legal l " asked Nickname . " If a nigger done it ? I mean , ai n't they got their own leagues l " " That depends whether the Mundy brothers give ' im the authority , " said old Wayne Heket . " Why , down home I know a feller signed everythin ' over to his dog , then just lay down and died . " " Could be Nickname 's right , though , " said Hot . " I 'm gon na look that up . It just could be that if a nigger has done it , that Bud here ai n't got no choice but to go over to their leagues  --  and for lire ! " " Now would n't that he sonie1hin ' ! Ir on top of Navin ' justp217one arm for hittin ' and throwin ' and wipin ' his bee-hind , poor Buddy wound up by mistake playin ' outfield for a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shovel hoss manure than have to play ball with jigaboos every day ! " " At least you 'd have your self-respect ! " " Poor Buddy ! Eatin ' all that shit they eat too , instead a ' real food ! " " And how 's he ever goin ' to know what they 're sayin ' when they 're talkin ' to him ? I hear tell over in them leagues , that instead of havin ' signals they just holler out Bunt ! ' , figurin ' the other team do n't know enough English to guess what 's comin ' next . Them spades is always scratchin ' themselvesso much , half the time what you figure for a hit-'n-run sign ai n't nothin ' but the manager goin ' after his coot-ies . " " Poor Buddy ! " " Poor Bud ! " While this exchange took place in the Mundy locker room , Bud continued to separate out of his locker what belonged to the Mundys and what belonged to him . Earlier in the day he had wondered just how unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teammates rolled around . He was a sentimental sucker from way back , and he knew it . But as it turned out , he found he was just too damn happy about going to be sad . Why , if anything it was the other players who looked to be on the brink of tears , as they watched him pack his cardboard suitcase with his few things , and render unto Ruppert what was the team 's . " Poor Buddy , " they said , " I do n't envy him if he winds up with a bunch of Mooches to have to sit down next to in the dugout on a hundred degree day . Pee-you ! " Oh , but did they envy him ! With the exception perhaps of John Baal , who considered a home a joke , there was hardly a NI undy who would n't have given his right arm to have been Big Bud I'arusha , the new Kakoola Reaper . " Well , fellas , " said Bud , " that 's it , I guess . " He waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so damn happy and start in being just a little sad , if only for auld lang sync . But it was not for hint to be miserable that day -- not quite yet . " Well , I wo n't forget you fellers , do n't worry , " said Bud ,  |p218and  suitcase in hand , he left the Mundy clubhouse , never to wear that uniform again . O.K. Ockatur arrived shortly thereafter to take his place ; no observations about niggers from the Mundys , either , not a word in fact about anything in this whole wide world , while the misshapen midget stripped out of his little street clothes and climbed into the scarlet and gray . Frank Mazuma , having already designated the opener of the Mundy-Reaper series " Welcome Bud Parusha Day , " held one of his press conferences before the game , this one to introduceBuddy to the Kakoola newspapermen , and even more important , " to squelch at the outset a most detestable rumor that , " said Mazuma , " reflects not simply upon that doormat known as Frank Mazuma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man bearing the honored baseball name of Parusha , but what is of far greater moment , upon the integrityof the wife of the President of the United States , and , by extension , of the Commander-in-Chief himself , the leader of the world 's greatest democracy in its do-or-die battle against the forces of evil . " Bud , standing sheepishly beside the Reaper owner , wore a Reaper home uniform of creamy white flannel , bearing on its back the orange numeral 11/2 . The fraction , of course , had come off O.K. Ockatur 's uniform ; as Mazuma explained to the reporters , it was not intended to suggest that Bud was missing anything ( " the empty right sleeve of his uniform , gentlemen , tells that story eloquently enough " ) but rather that he was endowed with about fifty per cent more courage than the ordinarymortal . " Why not go all the way then , Frank , " asked one reporter , " and give him 1  --  5  --  0 for a number ? " " Well , the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , but he said he thought it might seem to the other ballplayers that he was trying to lord it over them , if he had three numbers to their two . So we settled on the half . In fact , I said to him , Bud , do you think you can restore this fraction to a place of dignity in the baseball world ? ' and Buddy here said in reply , I sure can try , Mr. Mazuma. ' "  |p219Then  a reporter asked , " How the hell does he tie his shoelaces , Frank ? " " Good question , Red , but if you do n't mind , we 're going to save those exhibitions for the pregame ceremonies . Right now I want , for everyone 's sake , to turn to that rumor that has swept the league ever since I purchased Buddy from the Mundys late yesterday afternoon . I need n't tell you gentlemen that over the years I have grown somewhat accustomed to havingmy motives maligned by the self-styled protectors of this game  --  the people I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the s.o.b.s of O.B . But I really must confess that I was not prepared for their latest smear campaign . I simply did not believe that they could sink to such depths as to claim that this fine young ballplayer whom you see before you , who only yesterdaystruck the first four-bagger ever hit in the majors by a one-armed player , is not in fact one-armed at all , but that beneath his uniform he has a perfectly good second arm tied down to his left side . " " They did n't ! " someone cried ( someone perhaps in Mazuma'semploy ? ) . " Gentlemen of the press , I have asked you here to help me scotch this despicable lie of theirs before this boy goes out on the field today to have bestowed upon him the honors he earned yesterday with one mighty swing of his bat , and I remind you , against my own ball club . I am going to ask my little daughter , Doubloon , to come out here to assist Bud in removing his new Reaper shirt . She 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park , and I thought maybe this would be as good a time as any . Honey 2 Doubloon ? " Here a voluptuous young woman in brief white shorts and a clinging orange blouse ( and the word " Over " stitched across her back , just above the number " 21 " ) rushed in a clatter of high heels up to the microphone , kissed her daddy on the mouth , and then , to the applause and catcalls of the assembledreporters , began to fumble with the buttons of Bud 's uniform shirt. " lly the way , " ad-libbed Mazuma , " Doubloon ' does n't wean what some of you fellas think it does . Strange to say , it has nothing to do with things that come in pairs . " The newspapermen had to chuckle at , the famous Mazunlap220humor which he could direct even at the members of his own family . " I 'm all thumbs , " giggled Doubloon , as she loosened Bud 's belt so as to extract his shirttails from his trousers . " Oh what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fluttering her eyelids at the new Kakoola Reaper . " Nor , " said Mazuma , lighting up a cigar , " is Doubloon ' a mispronunciation of the capital of Ireland , for all that this kid could get anybody 's Irish up , if you know what I mean by Irish . ' " By now Bud 's shirt had been removed and Doubloon was drawing his orange sweatshirt out of his shorts . " Actually , " said Mazuma , continuing with the witty patter , " Doubloon ' is just another way of saying Do-re-mi . ' Tell the boys the names of your brothers and sisters , sweet-heart . " Turning momentarily from her task , she wiped the perspiration from her upper lip with a raised shoulder ( " Oh baby ! " cried one of the reporters , oddly moved by the gesture ) and in her whispery voice , said , " Jack , Buck , Gelt , and Dinero . " Then , with a little jump into the air , Doubloon yanked the sweatshirt over Bud 's head and the athlete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Doubloon , unable to suppress a shiver of revulsion . " Well , " said Mazuma , gravely now , " there it is , gentlemen . The truth for all to behold . Not a trace of a left arm . Not a suggestion . of a left arm . " Here , at a nod from Mazuma , the photographers surged forward and the room was incandescent with flashbulbs . " How about from the back , Bud ! " " Smile , Bud , cheer up ! This is your day , boy ! " " Make a muscle , Bud , with the one you got ! " " Cheese , Bud , cheese ! Thatta boy ! " When the photographers receded  --  with a promise from Mazuma that there was more to come  --  one of the reporters said , " Frank , you may not like this , but how do we know that this is n't some kind of trick make-up job such as they do in the movies ? How do we know that Bud 's missing arm is n't in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made out of wax or some such substance ' ? "  | " Doubloon , " said Mazuma , " would you do Daddy a favor ? To assure the reporters that there 's no arm hidden away inside a false covering of skin , would you just pass your hand up and down Bud 's side ? " " Do what ? " " Just press lightly up and down his left side , so they see that it is really and truly him . Well , come on now , honey . " " Oh , Daddy . " " Now , Dubby , you 're the one who wanted a summer job , you know that . You 're the one who wanted to wear the number Over 21 , ' remember ? You 're a big girl now and sometimes big people have to do things they do n't necessarily like to do . Touch his side , sweetheart . " " Oh , Daddy , I ca n't . It 's so uccchy . " " Look , young lady , either you touch him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put you over my knee ! You may be over twenty-one , you know , but you 're still not too old for your daddy to give you a good old-fashioned spanking , press conferenceor no press conference ! " Here the photographers came surging forward again , cameras in the air . " What a clown , " mumbled a reporter known to be no great admirer of Mazuma 's . " Clown my ass , Smitty ! " snapped the Reaper owner . " Do you think I want you boys leaving here half-believing that you 've been had ? Do you ? Do you think I want the people of this country to suspect that the wife of the President of the United States , the First Lady of the Land , has asked somebody to be honorary co-chairman of the March of Dimes who has been disguised by me , Frank Mazuma , for reasons of publicityor profit , to look like some kind of freak , when in fact be is n't ? Do you think I want our brave allies to harbor the slightest suspicion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you boys know what Tokyo Rose could do with a little tidbit like this ? Do you , Doubloon , my innocent daughter ? Do you realize the kind of venom that Jap bitch could pour into the ears of  --  ? " " Oh , please , " cried Doubloon , " I ca n't bear you , Daddy , when you sound like a minister ! " " And what 's wrong with sounding like a minister , may 1p222ask ? Since when is religion a dirty word in this country , may I ask ? " " Oh , all right , I 'll touch him  --  just stop lecturing me ! " " Okay then , okay , " said Mazuma , subsiding , and nodded to the photographers to get ready . Doubloon meanwhile readied herself . First , she squeezed her eyes shut very tightly like a little girl preparing to swallow a spoonful of cod-liver oil . Then she rose up on tiptoes so that her narrow white heels came popping up out of her orange shoes ( " Oh baby ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of her heels ) ; and then , with great reluctance and much wiggling of the can , she extended the finger of one hand very , very slowly in the direction of Bud Parusha 's body , which all the while he had been standing shirtless before the crowd , had been turning a deep shade of crimson . Because of the lightning storm of flashbulbs that accompanied the contact of Doubloon 's fingertip with Buddy 's flesh , the effect of her gesture upon the former Mundy was not immediately apparent . But when at last everyone 's vision was restored , there for all to see was a bulge of substantial proportionsin Buddy 's new flannel trousers . " My , my , " laughed the reporters . Mazuma , never at a loss for words , quipped , " Well , gentlemen , I 'll tell you one thing my new right-fielder ai n't missin ' , " and with that , brought the house down . What a clown indeed . Is it any wonder that when Mazuma beckoned , the reporters came in droves ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had struggled all their lives to prevent the great American game from becoming just another cheap form of popular entertainment , wished that Frank Mazuma , and all his kind , might be lined up against the outfield wall and shot ? The jubilant mood in which the press conference ended continued on through the pregame ceremonies of " Welcome Bud Parusha Day "  --  baseball stunts and feats of skill performed by the visiting Mundys . " Their tribute , " announced Frank Mazuma , to the forty-odd thousand who had of course turnedp223out not to welcome Bud Parusha but to witness the return of Bob Yamm , " their tribute to their former teammate , a great ballplayer and an even greater human being , brother of the great Tycoon Parushas , now serving so gallantly with the United States Marines , Angelo and Tony  --  " here the fans rose and accorded Angelo and Tony a standing ovation that lasted two full minutes  --  " Bud Parusha ! " Scattered applause as Bud ran from the Reaper dugout waving his mitt at the stands . From the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in awe at Buddy all in home team white . How like a bride he seemed to them in their own tattered road uniforms of gray ! Jolly Cholly , the kindest coach who ever lived , flashed the V for Victory sign  --  " Good luck , kid ! " he called , and Parusha was all at once washed over with an emotion so strong , so engulfing , that he even felt it in his missing limb . Take me back , cried the heart of the brideto-be , take me back before it 's too late . Maybe you 're where I belong ! But what American in his right mind ever wanted to be back with an eighth place team when he could be up with one in seventh ? So , instead of bolting for the Mundy dugout , Bud continued on to home plate , to his deliverers , Mazuma and Doubloon . And now the first of the Mundys who had agreed to performthat afternoon was introduced to the fans . On the sly , Mazuma had approached each of the disgruntled Ruppert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulars and one of the relief pitchers was so desperate , or so gullible , as to be taken in when the owner promised to make Reapers out of them too if they proved to be " crowd pleasers " in the manner of Buddy P. " Ladies and gentlemen , " Mazuma announced into the mike that had been set up at home plate , " it is a pleasure and an honor to introduce to you the youngest player in the history of the major leagues , Mundy second-sacker , fourteen-year-old Nickname Damur ! " Nickname carne charging full-speed from the visiting leatn 's dugout and made a perfect ( and he hoped , crowdpleasing ) hook slide around Doubloon 's leg and into the plate . " Cut it out , " snapped Doubloon . " Reputed 10 lie the fastest base runner in the game today  --  by those , that is , who 've had the rare opportunity of seeing him on base  --  only kidding , Nickname ! " quipped Mazuma , clapping the boy on the back , while the mob howled  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases with none other than the second cousin by marriage to the great Seabiscuit , my own Doubloon 's polo pony  --  Graham Cracker ! " Here a snorting little chestnut filly danced up out of the Reaper dugout . " Grahams ! " called Doubloon , and she ran to where the batboy , who had led the horse up past the water cooler and on to the playing field , was holding the pony by the reins . " Oh Grammies ! " cried Doubloon and buried her lips in the pony 's mane . Then , in high-heeled shoes , shorts , and blouse , she was hoisted up onto her mount by the batboy ; her riding crop was tossed up to her and she was off  --  galloping all the way to the center-field wall and back . " Graham Cracker will be carrying one hundred and seven pounds . Or , " said Mazuma , " to put it so that you folks who do n't follow the ponies understand , 38-22-36 . " Now Nickname and Graham Cracker lined up with their noses even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base . " As you fans know , " said Mazuma , " thanks to General Douglas D. Oakhart there are still no pari-mutuel windows allowed in Patriot League parks . But speaking for myself and fun-loving men everywhere , I do n't see what 's to stop you from placing a friendly little wager with your neighbor ... " While the hubbub of betting excitement swept through the stadium , Doubloon took the opportunity to lean down across Graham Cracker 's neck , and as though talking into the horse 's ear , whispered to the Mundy second-baseman , " Would n't crowd us on the turn , Nickname  --  not if you want to come out of this thing in one piece . " And they were off ! " It 's Graham Cracker in the lead as they break from the plate , " announced Mazuma , dropping into a deep gravelly voice and firing his words like bullets  --  " It 's Graham by half a length down the first-base line ! At the bag , Graham turns wide  --  and it 's Nickname making his dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now they 're neck and neck , Nickname'sright there ! So is Graham ! They 're around secondp225heading for third , and it 's Nickname now by a length , a length and a half with a third of the way to come  --  and now Graham Cracker is making her move as they pass the shortstop position ! Graham Cracker is not beaten yet ! She 's coming with a rush ! If she do n't get blocked , she 'll give that Mundy an awful drive ! Now they 're around third , they 're heading for home , and here comes Graham Cracker  --  " and now forty thousand screaming , hollering fans were on their feet , and even as Doubloon 's whip curled across his mouth , even as the blood sprang from his nose , Nickname could imagine victory  --  himself a Kakoola Reaper , second-baseman for an authentic big league team , a club with a park of its own , fans of its own , and an owner of whose presence you could never for a moment be in doubt ah , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and once again that whip as it flailed backwardsto crack open the skin of his brow , and no , he would not be defeated , no , he would not be a Mundy for the rest of his born days  --  " Do n't ! " hollered Jolly Cholly , as Nickname began to go into his slide  --  but he did , he did : at the risk of being crushed to powder beneath Graham Cracker 's four plunging legs , the ambitious fourteen-year-old , who wanted only to improve his lot in life ( as who does n't ? ) , who wanted only to better himself ( as who would n't ? ) , went in under the horse 's hoofs . " Crazy little prick ! " cried Doubloon , and swerving to avoid a collision at the plate , allowed Nickname to score . She herself went hurtling headlong out of the saddle and flew some thirty feet through the air , then bounced into the Mundy dugout , where Big John , taking her on the short hop , was able to squeeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry the broken body of the unconscious young woman to the emergency operating room of Kakoola Memorial . Then , with forty thousand flabbergasted fans looking on  --  yes , even the Kakoola fans were staggered , even their expectationsof a lively afternoon of thrills were exceeded by this calamitous turn of events  --  Mazuma borrowed a pistol from a stadium guard and put a bullet through Graham Cracker 's skull . " Gee , " gulped Nickname , as the pony , who had lain twitching it agony only inches from home plate , died with ap226whish of fumes from her exhaust , " I was only tryin ' to win . " In his grief , Mazuma had to smile . " Well , if Doubloon kicks the bucket , Damur , you 'll see what you won . When the fans get through with you , Nickname , you 'll envy the unenviableGamesh . My educated guess , kid , is that even if Doubloon survives , you yourself are washed up . To coin an appropriatelyparadoxical phrase , You 're out of the running , flashin-the-pan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mundy . " Kee-rect , " said Mazuma . " I believe you have just Mundied yourself for life . " " But how could I ? I won ! " " Tell it to them , Nickname , " said Mazuma , lifting his gaze to the mob howling now for Nickname 's unsportsmanlike hide . " Like the feller says , " quipped Mazuma , covering his ears , " where you 're concerned , it 's all over but the shouting . " Minutes passed before Mazuma could even hope to make himself heard ; then he stepped to the microphone , raised one hand , and into the red roaring mouth of the crowd , tossed this tender filet : " Official time , fourteen and four-fifths seconds . The winner  --  Damur ! " " Murderer ! Killer ! Monster ! Fiend ! "  --  yes , those were the nicknames they were now suggesting for the youth perenniallyin search of the right monicker for himself . After the groundskeepers had dragged Graham Cracker 's carcass across the field and out through the Mundy bullpen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints , Mazuma announced to the crowd that he intended to continue with " Welcome Bud Parusha Day " ceremonies as planned . And when , in a breaking voice , he said , " I ca n't help but think that Doubloon would want it that way , " the fans once again came to their feet to deliver a standing ovation . To the surprise and delight of everyone , the next person to be introduced was a stout , gray-haired woman in a longishprint dress and sturdy shoes who was helped up out of theReaper dugout and escorted to the microphone by a smallarmy of Boy Scouts . " Ladies and gentlemen , " said Mazuma , pecking her once on the cheek , " this little lady happens to be  --  my mom ! And with her , Troop 40 of Mazuma Avenue School ! " The Boy Scouts came instantly to attention and saluted  --   |p227some  saluted Mother Mazuma , others Frank Mazuma , still others the American flag in center field , and a few simply saluted each other . Mrs. Mazuma waved shyly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said into the mike , but so softly the fans had to lean forward in their seats to hear . . . Today , carne the even gentler echo . . . " I consider myself  --  " I consider myself . . . " the happiest mother  --  " the happiest mother . . . " on the face of the earth  --  " of the earth .. . Yet another standing ovation . " Now , fans , " said Mazuma , " as you all know , there is a custom in baseball , old as the great game itself , for the team at bat to attempt to rile up the team on the field by that benign form of badinage known as bench-jockeying . And as you also know if you 've been out to the park this year to see our erstwhilevisitors at play , there is probably no player in the entire league who the bench-jockeys can rile up quicker and easier than the man I am about to introduce . All you have to shout from the bench is Hothead , bet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mother ! ' and then watch that Mundy fume . Folks , let 's give a big welcome to Bud Parusha 's former teammate and fellow defective , Ruppert Mundy catcher , Hothead Ptah ! " Wearing but one shin guard  --  " Only got but one shin ! " Rot would snarl at the wiseguys  --  and his chest protector , and carrying his mask and his glove , Hot came racing out of the Mundy dugout at what for him was top speed . Oh , was he eager ! " Well , " said Mazuma when the laughter died down , " here she is , Hot my mom ! " " Howdy ! " " Good day , Mr. Ptah . " " Well , Hot , " said Mazuma , " think you can throw her out at second , two out of three ? Personally , I have to say I got my doubts , knowin ' Mom here and her speed . " The crowd went wild as Hothead proceeded instantly to lose his temper . " You 'll eat those words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mazuma , having to wait now for his own laughter to subside ( " Ills daughter 's in the hospital , snrgery is being perl'orntecl on her spinal column at this very moment , and he can still laugh ! What a guy ! " said the Healerp228sportscaster to the hundreds of thousands tuned to KALE ) , " to assist Hothead in his attempt to cut down my mother stealing two times out of three , here is the proud owner of the sorest arm in baseball , Mundy relief ace  --  " Yes , to the delight of the multitude , Chico Mecoatl began the long sad walk in from the Mundy bullpen . " Eeeep ! " they cried , " eeeep ! " imitating that little yelp he made when he pitched . Oh , how the crowd loved it  --  while the Mundys themselveswere dumbstruck . Chico , even Chico , with an E.R.A. of 14.06 , could no longer bear the indignity of wearing the RuppertR ! " And , " continued Mazuma , " covering second , to take the throw from Hothead  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Mundy second-sacker  --  " " No ! No ! " "  --  Nickname " " MURDERER ! KILLER ! THUG ! " they shrieked , as Nickname , tipping his cap , ran gamely out to his position . When Big John rose from the Mundy bench to go out to cover first , he quickly assured his startled teammates that he was only doing it for the kicks involved . " Do n't worry , boys . I ai n't no turncoat . Only trade I 'd consider is to the Gypsyswouldn'tmind dancin ' with a bear before I die ! Haw ! Haw ! " Mrs. Mazuma , meanwhile , had retired to the Reaper dugout , to leave her purse for safekeeping with the Boy Scouts of Troop 40 , and to change into her spikes . To spare himself some suffering , Chico rolled his warm-up pitch on the ground to Hot , who then pegged the ball down to Nickname at second . Ducky Rig , the Reaper catcher , came out to pretend to be the batter , and to yet another standing ovation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me check  --  yes sir , that 's it all right , a major league record , " said the sportscaster , " for standing ovations in a pregame ceremony in regular season competition "  --  Mazuma 's mom walked to first in her baseball shoes , being careful to avoid stepping down on the freshly laid foul line . " How do you do , Mr. Baal , " she said , and Big John gave the fans their money 's worth by sweeping off his cap and bowing in the manner of Sir Walter Raleigh . Then the Mexican right-hander went into his stretch ; he looked cursorily back over his left shoulder to first  --  and surep229enough , the old lady in the print dress came climbing down off the bag , and taking one inch , and then another , and then another , wound up taking herself a very healthy lead indeed . Engaging Chico 's eyes , she began to move her arms in a slow swinging motion , looking for all the world as though she would be breaking for second as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Chico had n't thrown to first to hold a regular base runner to the bag so far this year , and he was n't starting up at this late date with an old lady . Not with his arm , he was n't . So , into his snake-like wind-up he went , and with that yelp of his  --  " Eeeeep ! "  --  looped the ball into the dirt . Hot blocked it neatly with his wooden leg , and Mrs. Mazuma held at first . On the second pitch she went ! The pitch , when it finally arrived , was high , but Hot , playing inspired ball , leaped to grab it and still in the air , fired down to Nickname . Dress and all , Mrs. Mazuma slid , and her son , who was serving now as umpire at second , called , " Y'r out ! " The look she gave him when she rose to brush the dirt off herself could hardly be described as maternal . " He missed the tag , Frank . " " I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mazuma into the hand mike he was carrying . " He never touched me , Frank , " said Mrs. Mazuma , kicking angrily at the bag . " Look , no favors around here just because you happened once upon a time to have nursed the umpire ! If I said Y'r out ! ' , y'r out ! " Shaking her head in dismay , she trotted back to first , but not before turning to toss a few words Nickname 's way . Nickname now walked the ball to the mound , waving for I lot and Big John to join him and Chico for a conference . " Look , " he said , " you ai n't gon na believe this  --  but know what Mrs. Mazuma just told met She flashes me this look , see , and she says , Do n't block that bag , sonny , or next time I 'll cut your ears off ! ' " " Well , whattayaknow ! Just as I suspicioned ! That card Mazunia done it to us again the she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " snarled I lot , " I do n't care if it 's a it ! You **32;14805;TOOLONG , and in this narrative I intend to avoid the conventionalhowlers . The " flied lice " and " No tickee , no shirtee " variety is really no closer to the real thing than the plain speech I have just put in Big Hing 's mouth . Chinese do more than transpose r and 1 , and v and b , and s and sh . They swallow most of their consonants and they seldom give a word an ending : a glottal stop amputates every final syllable . So what Big Hing really said was , " Shi ' duh ' " and " We go ' a pro'luh ' " ; there is no point in being faithful to this yammering . Little Hing 's English was much better than Big 's , though Little spoke very fast ; but when they were in the same room , Little did n't open his trap , except to mutter in Cantonese . That morning he sat in silence , his teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uppers with yellow pickets . The conversation , I knew , would be brief , and the only reason Big Hing asked me to sit down was that I towered over the desk like a sweaty bear , panting with annoyance , my tattoos showing . My size bothered them especially . I was a foot taller than Big Hing , and a foot and a half taller than Little  --  when they were standing . I sat and sank into a chair of plastic mesh , and as I was sinking Big Hing started to explain . A month before , he had been told that a man was coming from Hong Kong to audit our books . There was another Fling in Hong Kong , a towkay bigger than Big Hing , and the auditing was an annual affair . It was also an annual humiliation because Big Hing did n't like his accounts questioned . Still , it happened every year . At one time it was a sallow little man who always arrived ravaged from traveling deck class on a freighter ; then , for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popping eyes , who hugged a briefcase  --  turned to suede by wear  --  to his starched smock with frog buttons . The auditors stayed for a week , snapping the abacus and thumbing the ledger ; Big Hing sat close by ,  |p7|pouring  tea , saying nothing . Last year it was a man called Lee , and he was the problem , though Big Hing did n't say so . All he said was : meet this man at the airport . It was why Hing was agitated . He assumed Lee was Cantoneseor at least Chinese . But he discovered , I never learned how , that Lee was an ang moh , a redhead . The ang mohs were my department . It was the reason I was employed by I ling  --  Chop Hing Kheng Fatt : Ship Chandlers &; Provisioners , as the shop sign read . Hing was peeved that he was mistaken about the name , and furious that his books were going to be scrutinized by an ang moh . He beamed with anger and banged his fist down upon the fluttering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet him at the airport . I drew my own conclusions , and I was correct in every detail except the spelling , which was Leigh . " My car 's at the garage , " I said . I was not being difficult . It was a noisy ten-year-old Renault with 93,000 miles on the clock . One wheel , the front right , had come unstuck from the chassis and made the front end shimmy at any speed , a motion that rubbed the tread from the tires . " I 'll have to take a taxi . " " Can , can , " said Big Fling . Little Hing whispered something , staring at me , keeping his teeth locked , a coward 's ventriloquism . For Little Hing I was the ultimate barbarian : my hair was once reddish , I am hairy , my arms are profusely tattooed  --  a savage , " just out of the trees , " as Yardley used to say . " Bus to airport , taxi to town , " said Big Hing . That was Little 's whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus was forty cents . There was no direct bus . I hated sitting at an out-of-town bus shelter , in the heat , with twenty schoolchildren . But I said okay because I could see Big Hing 's anger makes him determined that I should save one-sixty and know who was boss . I did n't start arguments I knew in advance I was going to lose . Bigp8Hing was my towkay : I could n't win . But my dealings with him were small . He counted out $2.40 from petty cash and looked at his watch . " What time is his plane due in ? " I asked . Big Hing thought three-thirty ; Little murmured in Cantonese , and I expected an amendment , but Big stuck to threethirtyand gave me the flight number . I went down to consult my bus guide . So far it had been an unpleasant day , ruined first by the peon telling me to hurry and second by the command to take the bus all the way out to the airport . After looking at the bus guide I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right about there being no direct bus , but the i 8-A Singapore Traction Company bus passed by Moulmein Green . I could have lunch at home for a change , and if I hurried , a quick nap . The transfer would have to be made on Paya Lebar Road  --  a stroke of luck : I could see if Gladys was available before continuing on the 93 to the airport . None of this would cost a penny extra ; out of two humiliations I had rescued a measure of self-respect . And if Gladys was free and Leigh was interested I stood to make nine dollars . In any event , I was anxious to meet him . It was nice to see a new face , and an ang moh 's was more welcome than most . We were lonelier than we admitted to ; after many years of residence in Singapore , we all went for the mail twice a day , even Yardley and Smale , who never got any . This is the beginning of my story , and already I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haphazardrecollection of a single morning 's interruption , than if I had planned it as carefully as I once intended and began with the rumbling factual sentence I used to repeat to myself in the days when I believed my early life mattered , before I went away  --  about being born in the year 1918 , in the North End of the city of Boston , the second child of twop9transplanted Italians ; and then the part about my earliest memory ( the warm room , my wet thumb and velvet cushion , m y father singing with the opera on the radio ) . There is no space for that here.  |p10FOURTEEN  YEARS AGO , lowering myself on a rope from the rusty stern of the Allegro , anchored then in the Straits of Malacca ( " the financial straits , " Yardley said ) , I did not think I was an old man  --  though if anyone had insisted I was old I would have believed him . Most people are willing to make fools of themselves with a little persuasion , and the question of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old and young make little difference : the old man talks easily to a child . They say every age is more barbarous than the last . It is possible . If there is an error in the statement it does n't matter , because the people who say this are either very young or very old , just starting out and with no experience , or musing in life 's sundowner with false flickers of halfforgottenmemories . The age , as they call it , is too big to see , but they have time on their hands : it is too early for one and too late for the other to worry about being wrong . What they do n't know is that however awful the age is , it is placid and hopeful compared to a certain age in a man . Fifty : it is a dangerous age  --  for all men , and especiallyp11for one like me who has a tendency to board sinking ships . Middle age has all the scares a man feels halfway across a busy street , caught in traffic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black upstairs room , full of furniture , afraid to turn on the lights because he 'll see the cockroaches he smells . The man of fifty has the most to say , but no one will listen . His fears sound incredible because they are so new  --  he might be making them up . His body alarms him ; it starts playing tricks on him , his teeth warn him , his stomach scolds , he 's balding at last ; a pimple might be cancer , indigestiona heart attack . He 's feeling an unapparent fatigue ; he wants to be young but he knows he ought to be old . He 's neither one and terrified . His friends all resemble him , so there can be no hope of rescue . To be this age and very far from where you started out , unconsoled by any possibility of a miracle  --  that is bad ; to look forward and start counting the empty years left is enough to tempt you into some aptly named crime , or else to pray . Success is nasty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen , who know nastiness without the winch of money . Then it is clear : the ship is swamped to her gunwales , and the man of fifty swims to shore , to be marooned on a little island , from which there is no rescue , but only different kinds of defeat . That was how I recognized Mr. Leigh , the man they sent from Hong Kong to audit our books . I knew his name and his flight number  --  nothing else . I waited at Gate Three and watched the passengers file through Health and Immigration . First the early birds , the ones who rush off the plane with briefcases , journalists and junior executives with Chinese girl friends , niftily dressed , wearing big sunglasses ; then the two Chinese sisters in matching outfits ; a lady with a little boy and further back her husband holding the baby and juggling his passport ; a pop group with blank faces and wigs of frizzy hair , looking like a delegation from New Guinea , anxious to be met ; the missionary priest with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a few overdressed ones , their Zurich topcoats over their arms . Laggingbehind , a lady in a wheelchair about whom people say , " Lord , I do n't know how she does it , " a man with a big box , a returning student with new eyeglasses , and Mr. Leigh . I knew him as soon as I set eyes on him : he was the only one who looked remotely like me . He was red-faced and breathless ; and , unaccustomed to the heat , he was mopping his face with a hanky . He was a bit heavier than he should have been  --  his balance was wrong , his clothes too small . I waved to him through the glass doors . He nodded and turned away to claim his suitcase . I went into the men 's room , just to look in the mirror . I was reassured by my hair , not white like Leigh 's and still quite thick . But I wished I had more hair . My face was lined : my nap had made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked more rumpled than usual because I had rolled my sleeves down and buttoned the cuffs . It was my tattoos . I hid them from strangers . Strangers ' eyes fix on tattoos as they fix on scars in unlikely places . A person spots a tattoo and he has you pegged : you 're a sailor , or you do some sort of poorly paid manual labor ; one day you got drunk with your friends and they got tattooed , and to be one of the gang so did you . It did not happen this way with me , but that is the only version strangers know of a tattooing . Mr. Leigh was just pushing through the glass doors as I came back from the toilet smoothing my sleeves . I said hello and tried to take his suitcase . He would n't let go ; he seemed offended that I should try to help . I knew the feeling . He was abrupt and wheezing and his movements tried to be quick . It is usually this way with people who have just left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their rhythm is different  --  they are attempting a new rhythm  --  and they are not sure what is going to happen next . The sentencethey have been practicing on the plane , a greeting , ap13quip , they know to be inappropriate as soon as they say it . Leigh said , " So they did n't send the mayor . " Then , " You do n't look Chinese to me . " I suggested a beer in the lounge . " What time are they expecting me ? " he asked . He had just arrived and already he was worried about Hing . I knew this man : he did n't want to lose his job or his dignity ; but it is impossible to keep both . " They were n't too sure what time your plane was coming in , " I said . We both knew who " they " were . He put down his suitcase . One reason I remember the first conversation I had with Mr. Leigh ( or William , as he insisted I call him , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply to " Bill " ) is that I had the same conversation with every ang moh I met in Singapore . We were in the lounge having a beer , sharing a large Anchor ; every few minutes the loud-speakers becamenoisy with adenoidal announcements of arrivals and departures in three languages . Leigh was still keyed up and he sat forward in his chair , taking quick gulps of beer and then staring into his glass . I asked about the flight and the weather in  --  William beingEnglish , I attempted some slang  --  " Honkers . " This made him look up from his glass and squint straight at me , so I gave up . And was it a direct flight ? No , he said , it landed for fueling at Bangkok . " Now that 's a well-named place ! " I said and grinned . I ca n't remember whether it got a rise out of him . I asked if he had a meal on the plane . " Yes , " he said , " perfectly hideous . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , trying to sound more disgusted than him . The word stuck to my tongue . I was n't telling the truth . I thought airplane food was very good , always the correct color and each course in its own little covered trough on the tray , the knivesp14and forks wrapped up and all the rest of the utensils in clean envelopes and in fitted slots and compartments . I had to agree the food was hideous . He was a guest , and I had plans for him . The next thing I said to him was what I said to everyone who came through . I said it slowly , with suggestive emphasis on the right syllables : " If there 's anything you want in Singapore , anything at all "  --  I smiled here  --  " just let me know and I 'll see what I can fix up . " He replied , as most strangers did  --  but he was not smiling  --  " I 'm sure you do n't mean anything . " " Anything . " I took a drink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promise . He mopped his face . " I was wondering  --  " And I knew what he was wondering . The choice was n't large , but people did n't realize that . A tout could follow a tourist on the sidewalk and in the space of a minute offer everything that tourist could conceivably want . The touts who did n't know English handed over a crudely printed three-by-five card to the man with a curious idle face . The card had half a dozen choices on it : blue movies , girls , boys , exhibition , massage , ganja  --  a menu which covered the whole appetite of longing . No new longings were likely , and the tout who breathed , " You want something special ? " had in mind a combination based on the six choices . Leigh was perspiring heavily . Vice , I was thinking : it sounded like what it was , it squeezed , expressing the grape of fantasy . Gladys was free . It was possible to stop off at her place on the way back from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to say so . But it is a mistake to make explicit suggestions : I discovered that very early . If I suggested a girl and the feller wanted a boy he would be ashamed to admit it and the deal would be off . It was always wrong to offer an exhibition  --  like saying , " You ca n't cut the mustard but how about watching ? "  --   |p15and  if a person was thinking of having a go he would refuse if I suggested it . Most people thought their longings were original , but they were n't : they could only be one of six , or else a combination . Various as fantasy , but fantasy did n't allow for the irregular performance of man 's engine . I knew the folly of expectation , and how to caution a feller against despairing of his poor engine and perhaps hitting his pecker with a hammer . I sized up Leigh as he was blotting his cheeks and pulling at his collar , counting the whirring fans in the lounge . I took him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an ordinary massage , something special , Lillian jumpingnaked on his spine . Intimacy , as the girls called it , or boochakong , to use the common Chinese term I preferred to the English verb , would still be a strong possibility , I was thinking . There was no such thing as impotence : it was successful as soon as money changed hands . It was n't the money , but the ritual . " What do you say ? " I asked , as brightly as I could . Usually it was n't so hard ; when it was , it meant the feller was worried about asking for something I could n't provide . " Oh , I do n't know , " he said , and drew a deep breath . So I was wrong about the exhibition , and just as well , I thought ; I hated those monkeyshines . I guessed Leigh was slightly bent ; his particular crimp was a weakness for transvestites , of which , as is well known , there is a whole sorority in Singapore . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardest ones to handle , but over the years I had seen how they reacted to the Chinese boys who in skirts were more winsome than girls . Middle age may be an emergence of this comfort , too , a fling at play-acting with a pretty boy , a reasonable occasion for gaiety , the surprise of costuming and merry vestments . If I detected the wish I took the fellers down to Bugis Street and steeered them over to the reliable ones , Tiny or Gina . Lucy had the operation which some/times disappointed the fellers . Your bashful fruit pretended he was talking to a girl , but just so we knew where we stood I said , " Take Gina  --  he 's a very nice feller . " The client looked surprised and said , " You mean  --  ? " And then : " I might as well take him home  --  I 'm too drunk to notice the difference , " and going out would slip me ten dollars . " What did you have in mind ? " asked Leigh . A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just keep smiling in a willing fashion . But he looked as though he meant it and would n't tumble to my willingness . I said , " I thought . . . if you were interested in anything illegal , hyah-yah , I might be able to  --  " " Illegal ? " said Leigh and put his hanky down . He leaned over and , puzzled and interested , asked , " You mean a prosti-tute ? " I tried to laugh again , but the expression on his face turningfrom puzzlement to disgust rattled inc . It had been a mistaketo say anything . " No , " I said , " of course not . " But it came too late , my tardy denial only confirmed the truth , and Leigh was so indignant  --  he had straightened up and stopped drinking  --  that shame , unfamiliar as regret , tugged at my neck hairs . Through the glass-topped table in front of me I could see I was curling my toes and clawing at my sandals . " Let 's go , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to get up . I was hot ; I wanted to roll up my sleeves , now damply stuck to my tattoos , revealing them . " Flowers , " he said , and narrowed his eyes at me , " are you a ponce ? " " Me ? Hyah-mn ! What a thing to say ! " It was a loud hollow protest with a false echo . Prostitute , he had said , pimp , whore , queer , ponce  --  words people use to name the things they hate ( liking them they leave them nameless , the human voice duplicating the suspicion that passion is unspeakable ) . " I 'm a sort of pornocrat , " I was going top17say , to mock him . I decided not to . His incredulity was a prompting for me to lie . The waitress passed by . Leigh said , " Wan am ! " greeting her in vilely accented Mandarin . " Scuse me ? " she said . She took a pad from the pocket of her dress , a pencil from her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Leigh . He had turned away from me and was looking at the girl . But the girl was looking at me . " Nee hway bu hway  --  " " Mister , " said the girl to me , " what ship your fiend flom ? " Leigh cleared his throat and said we 'd better be going . In the taxi he said hopelessly , " I was wondering if I might get a chance to play a little squash . " " Sure thing , " I said , pouncing . " I can fix that up for you in a jiffy . " Squash ? He was wheezing still , and red as a beet . Carrying his suitcase to the taxi rank he kept changing hands and groaning , and then he put his face out the taxi window and let the breeze blow into his mouth , taking gulps of it the way dogs do in a car . He had swallowed two little white pills with his beer . He looked closely at his palms from time to time . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club , Flowers ? " We had agreed that I was to call him William if he called me Jack . I liked my nursery-rhyme name . Now I felt he was cheating . " Name it , " I said , and to remind him of our agreement I added , " William . " I had an application pending at the Cricket Club once , or at least the " Eggs , " two elderly bald clients of mine , who were members , said I did . I had been trying to join a club in Singapore for a long time . Then it was too late . I could n't apply for membership without giving myself away , for I often drank in the clubs and most of the members  --   |p18they  knew me well  --  thought I had joined years before . There was n't a club on the island I could n't visit one way or another . I had clients at all of them . " Cricket Club 's got some squash courts , but the Tanglin 's just put up new ones  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's none at the Swimming Club so far , though we 've got a marvelous sauna room . " I thumped his knee . " We 'll find something , William . " " Sounds very agreeable , " he said , pulling his head back into the taxi . He was calm now . " How do you manage three clubs ? I 'm told the entrance fees are killing . " " They are pretty killing , " I said , using his dialect again , " but I reckon it 's worth it . " " You 're not a squash player yourself ? " " No , " I said , " I 'm just an old beachcomber  --  drinking 's my sport , nyah ! " That made him chuckle ; I was laughing too , and as I shifted on the seat I felt a lump in my back pocket press into my butt : two thick envelopes of pornographic pictures I had brought along just in case he asked . Their reminding pressure stopped my laughing . The taxi driver tilted his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gull ? You want boy ? Mushudge ? What you want I get . What you like ? " " Just a game of squash , driver , thank you very much , " I said in a pompous fruity voice to this poor feller for the benefit of the horse 's ass next to me . Then I smiled at William and tried to tip him a wink , but his head was out the window and he was blinking and gulping at the breeze and probably wondering what he was doing on that tedious little island.  |p19I  WALKED into a bar where they did not know me well and I could hear the Chinese whispers : " Who does that jackass think he is ? " And then it ceased ; my face made silence . It was not the face you expected in Ho 's or Toby 's or the Honey Bar , in the Golden Treasure or Loon 's Tip-Top . Years ago I had not minded , but later my heart sank on the eveningsall my regulars were tied up and I had to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting with plump hostesses ; and the secret society members watched me  --  in Ho 's the Three Dots , in the Honey Bar the Flying Dragons . There was no goblin as frightening as a member of a secret society staring me down . He first appeared to have no eyes , then the slits became apparent and I guessed he was peering at me from somewhere behind the slits . I never saw the eyes . The slits did n't speak ; and it was impossible to read the face , too smooth for a message . I turned away and slipped the manager a few dollars to releasethe girl , and when I was hurrying out I heard growls and grunts I did n't understand , then titters . On the sidewalkI heard the whole bar crackle and explode into yelling laughter . Now they had eyes ; but I was outside.  |p20One  night a thug spoke to me . He was sitting up front at the bar eating a cold pork pie with his fingers . He was wearingthe secret society uniform , a short-sleeved shirt with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark  --  and his hair rather long , with wispy wing-tufts hanging past his ears . I did n't think he saw me talking to the manager , and after I passed the money over and turned to go the thug put his hand on my shoulder , and rubbing pork flakes into it , said gruffly , " Where you does wuck ? " I did n't answer . I hurried down the gloomy single aisle of the bar , past eerily lit Chinese faces . The thug called out , " Where you witching ! " That was in the Tai-Hwa on Cecil Street , and I never went near it again . Who is he ? they murmured in the Belvedere , the Hilton , the Goodwood when I was in the lobby flicking through a magazine , waiting for one of my girls to finish upstairs . I could have passed for a golf pro when I was wearing my monogrammed red knit jersey  --  the one with long sleeves  --  and my mustard-colored slacks and white ventilated shoes . No one knew I had a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for taxis in town and who sent me everywhere , but always to redheads , with parcels . In my short-sleeved flowered batik shirt , with my tattoos displayed , they took me for a beachcomber with a private incomeor a profitable sideline , perhaps " an interesting character . " Once , in the Pebble Bar of the Hotel Singapura , an American lady who was three sheets to the wind said I looked like a movie actor she knew , but she could n't think of his name . " What 's your name ? " she asked . I smiled , to give her the impression that I might be thatactor , said , " Take a guess , sweetheart , " and then I left ; leaving , I heard some hoots , from the gang of oil riggers whoalways drank there , and I knew who they were hooting at . My appearance , this look of a millionaire down on his luck ,  |p21which  is also the look of a bum attempting to be princely , was never quite right for most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color in the Tai-Hwa and all the other Chinese joints  --  that was clear ; at the Starlight , strictly Cantonese , they seated me with elderly hostesses and overcharged me . I was too dressy for the settler hangouts and never had enough money for more than one drink at the Hilton or Raffles , though I looked as if I might have belonged in those hotels . I certainly looked like a member of the Tanglin Club , the Swiss Club , the Cricket Club , and all the others where my chits were signed for me by fellers who liked my discretion . I was always welcome in the clubs , but that was a business matter . And they did not laugh at the Bandung : they knew me there . In the taxi I mentioned the Bandung to Leigh ; he did n't say no , but he thought we should stop at Hing 's first  --  " Let 's have a look at the towkay " was what he said . We got stuck in rush-hour traffic , a solid unmoving line of cars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were passing the wrecked sedan at a crawl to note down the license number so they could play it on the lottery . There was a bus in front of us displaying the bewildering sign I Do n't Know Why , But I Prefer Sanyo . The local phrase for beeping was " horning , " and they were horning to beat the band . We sat and sweated , gagging on the exhaust fumes ; it was after five by the time we got to Hing 's . Little Hing was sitting in the shop entrance reading the racing form . He sat like a roosting fowl , his feet on the seat , his knees drawn up under his chin . Seeing us , he turned his bony face and bawled upstairs , then he locked his teeth and snuffled and paddled the air with his free hand , which meant we were to wait . " Your Oriental politeness , " I said . " He 'll spit in a minute , probably hock a louie on your shoes , so watch out . "  |p22We  had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was making us wait . Hing spent the best part of a day saving face , and Yardley said , " When you see his face you wonder why he bothers . " Gopi , the peon , brought a wooden stool for Leigh , but Leigh just winced at it and studied Hing 's sign : Chop Hing Kheng Fatt : Ship Chandlers &; Provisioners , and below that in smaller assured script , Catering &; Victualling , Marine Hardware , Importers , Wholesale Drygoods &; Foodstuffs , Licensed Agents , Frozen Meat , and the motto , " All Kinds of Deck &; Engine Stores &; Bonded Stores &; Sundries . " " Sundries " was my department . The signs on the shops to the left and right of Hing , and all the other shops  --  biscuitcolored , peeling , cracked and trying to collapse , a dusty terraceof shophouses sinking shoulder to shoulder on Beach Road  --  were identical but for the owner 's name ; even the stains and cracks were reduplicated down the road as far as you could see . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramshackle permanency common in Eastern ports , as if having fallen so far they would fall no further . " What 's your club in Hong Kong ? " I asked . " Just one , I 'm afraid , " he said . He paused and smiled . " The Royal Hong Kong . " " Jockey or Yacht ? " " Yacht , " he said quickly , losing his smile . Little Hing spat and went back to his racing form without bothering to see where the clam landed . " Missed again , " I said , winking at Leigh . " I 've heard the Yacht Club 's a smashing place , " I said , and he looked at me the way he had when I said " Honkers . " " You 're in luck , actually . You have a reciprocal membership with the Tanglinhere and probably a couple of others as well . " " No , " he said , " I inquired about that before I came down . Bit of a nuisance , really . But there it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong Yacht Clubp23and the Tanglin Club had reciprocal memberships and privileges ; a member of one could sign bar chits at the other and use all the club 's facilities . So he was not a member , and there we were standing on the Beach Road sidewalk , on the lip of its smelly monsoon drain , at the beck and call of a surly little towkay who had chosen to sulk upstairs , lying about clubs we did n't belong to . It made me sad , like the pictures hidden in my back pocket I would never admit to having : two grown men practicing lies , and why ? Big Hing came out in his pajamas and gave Leigh that secretsociety stare . Hing was not a member ; he was a paid-up victim of the Red Eleven , who controlled Beach Road and collected " coffee money " for protection . The payment gave Hing a certain standing , for having victimized him the Red Eleven would stick by him and fight anyone who tried to squeeze him . Leigh handed over a letter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flap . He put on his old wire glasses and read the column of characters , then he smiled his angry eyeless smile and nodded at Leigh . " I trust everything is in order , " said Leigh to Hing . It was a wasted remark ; Hing was muttering to Little Hing , and Little replied by muttering into the racing form he held against his face . " Where 's our friend going to put up ? " I asked . " Booked at the Strand , " said Big Hing . " Can come tomorrow . " He picked up his grandson and bounced the trouserless little feller to show the interview was over . The Strand Hotel was on Scotts Road , diagonally across the road from the Tanglin Club . As we were pulling into the Strand 's driveway , under the arch with the sign readingEuropean Cuisine  --  Weddings  --  Parties  --  Reasonable Prices , Leigh saw the Tanglin signboard and said , " Why do n't we pop over for a drink ? " I let my watch horrify me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half past six . That place is a madhouse this time of day . Fellersp24having a drink after work . Look , William , I know a quiet little  --  " " I 'd love to have a look at those new squash courts of yours , " he said . He hit me hard on the arm and said heartily , " Come on , Flowers , I 'll buy you a drink . " He gave his suitcase to the room-boy at the Strand , signed the register , and then clapped his stomach with two hands . " Ready ? " " I 'll buy you a drink , " said Leigh , but that was impossible because money was not allowed and only a member could sign chits . The brass plaque on the club entrance  --  MEMBERS ONLY  --  mocked us both . I looked for someone I knew , but all I could see were tanned long-legged mothers , fine women in toweling smocks , holding beach bags and children 's hands , waiting for their syce-driven cars after a day at the club pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing ; the sight of that joy lifted my heart  --  I could n't help but think they were plotting some trivial infidelity . " The new squash courts are over there , " I said , stepping nimbly past the doorman and bounding up the stairs . " Drink first , " said Leigh . " I 'm absolutely parched . " He was enjoying himself and he seemed right at home . He led the way into the Churchill Room , and " Very agreeable " he said , twice , as he looked for an opening at the bar . The Churchill Room had just been renovated : thick wallto-wallcarpets , a new photograph of Winston , a raised bar , and a very efficient air-conditioning system . In spite of the cool air I was perspiring , a damp panel of shirt clung to my back ; I was searching for a familiar face , someone I knew who might sign a drink chit . The bar was packed with men in white shirts and ties , some wearing stiff planter 's shorts , standing close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their companions or sort of climbing over each other and waving chit pads at the barmen . Leigh was push/ing ahead of me and I had just reached out to tap him on the shoulder and tell him I had remembered something important  --  my nerve had failed me so completely I could not think what , and prayed for necessity 's inspiration  --  when I saw old Gunstone over in the corner at one of the small tables , drinking alone . Gunstone was one of my first clients ; he was in his seventies and came to Singapore when it was a rubber estate and a few rows of shophouses and go-downs . During the war he was captured by the Japanese and put to work on the Siamese Death Railway . He told me how he had buried his friend on the Burmese border , a statement like a motto of hopeless devotion , an obscure form of rescue , I buried my friend . He was the only client who took me to lunch when he wanted a girl , but he was also the cagiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and even put my own name on the hotel register . What he did with the girls , I never knew  --  I never asked : I did not monkey with a feller 's confidence  --  but it was my abiding fear that one day Gunstone 's engine was going to stop in a hotel room I had reserved , and I was going to have to explain my name in the register . I never saw Gunstone 's wife ; he only took her to the club at night and most of my club work was in the daytime . " Jack , " he said , welcoming me , showing me an empty chair . Good old Gunstone . " Evening , Mr. Gunstone , " I said . It was a servile greeting , I knew , but I could not see Leigh and I was worried . Gunstone seemed glad to see me ; that was a relief . I feared questions like , " Who are you and what are you doing here ? " " What 'll you have ? " asked Gunstone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gunstone turned to find a waiter Leigh appeared with a drink in his hand . " Chappie here wants your signature , Flowers , " said Leigh.  |p26I  took the chit pad from the waiter and put it on Gunstone'stable , saying " All in good time , " then introduced Leigh . Gunstone said , " Ever run into old So-and-So in Hong Kong ? " and Leigh said charmingly , " I 've never had the pleasure . " Gunstone began describing the feller , saying , " He 's got the vilest habits and he 's incredibly mean and nasty and  --  " Gunstone smiled  --  " perfectly fascinating . He might be in U.K. now , on leave . " " Do you ever go back to U.K. ? " Leigh asked . " Used to , " said Gunstone . " But the last time I was there they passed a bill making homosexuality legal . I said to my wife , Let 's get out of here before they make the blasted thing compulsory ! ' " Leigh laughed . " I meant to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you married ? " " Nope , " I said . Leigh went on talking to Gunstone . Once , and it was at the Tanglin Club , I used to fix up a certain feller with girls . The feller was married and I eventually got friendly with the wife , and " She 's ever so nice , " I said to the feller . On the afternoons when he had one of my girls I visited his wife at their house in Bukit Timah and had no fear that he would show up . But there were children ; she hollered at them and sent them out with the amah . She was very sweet to me , a moment after she had cuffed the children . One afternoon I was in the Bandung . I had agreed we should meet , but I realized I was late , delaying over a large gin . She was waiting ; I was waiting ; I did not want to go . It was like marriage . I went on drinking , and lost her . " I must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pads over and signed them . He said , " I scratch your back , you scratch mine . " " Tomorrow , " I said , and winked . " Lunch , " said Gunstone . " The usual time , what ? " " Sounds frightfully hush-hush , " said Leigh.  |p27To  Gunstone I said , " We were just leaving , too , " which made it impossible for Leigh to object . It was unfair to do this , but I was sore : Leigh 's two gin slings were going to cost me a whole afternoon of waiting in the lobby of a hotel , cooling my heels and worrying about Gunstone 's engine . Yardley was telling his joke about the Irishman and the lovestarvedgorilla as we entered the Bandung . We walked over to the bar and , perversely I thought , Yardley delivered the punch line to Leigh , " One thing more , sair , ' says O'Flannaganto the zoo keeper , If there 's any issue  --  any issue at all  --  it 's got to be raised a Roman Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smale , Frogget , and loudestof all and closing his eyes with mirth , Yardley himself . I smiled , though I had heard it before . Leigh was n't amused ; he said , " Yes , well . " That was his first mistake in the Bandung , not laughing at Yardley 's joke . Yardley , an oldtimer , had been drinking in the Bandung for years , and one day when Yardley was out of the room Frogget said , " Yardleyis the Bandung . " Every bar had a senior member ; Yardley was ours . Frogget , a large shy feller , balding but not old , was Yardley 's ape . Frogget  --  Desmond Frogget  --  ate like a horse , but he was sensitive about his weight ; it was considered impolite to remark on the amount of food Frogget ate , the platters of noodles he hoovered up . Froggetcould not have been much more than thirty-five , but the ridiculous man had that English knack of assuming elderly biases and a confounding grumpiness that made him seem twice his age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that happened before he was born and like other equally annoying youths who drank at the Bandung started sentences with " I always " and " I never . " " Do n't believe we 've met , " said Yardley , putting his hand out to Leigh . Leigh hinted at reluctance by frowning as he offered hisp28hand , but the worst offense was that after he said his name he spelled it . " Been in Singapore long ? " asked Srnale . Smale was a short , ruddy-faced man whose squarish appearance gave the impression of having been carpentered . He carried a can of mentholated cigarettes with him wherever he went . He was working the cutter on the lid as he asked Leigh the question . " No , " I said , " he just  --  " " To be precise , " said Leigh in a prissy voice , and checkinghis watch , " four hours and forty-five minutes . " " We like to be precise around here , " said Yardley , nudgingFrogget . " Do n't we , Froggy ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slag heap of life , it 's a bloody good thing to know the time of day , what Froggy ? " " I always wear my watch to bed , " said Frogget . " You come down from K.L. " Yates asked , seeing Yardleygetting hot under the collar . " Hong Kong , " said Leigh , stressing the Hong the way residentsdo . He looked around the room , as if trying to locate an exit . The Bandung was a huge place  --  in its prime a private house with an elegant garden , birdbath , and sundial and intersecting cobblestone paths . But the garden had fallen to ruin and the trellises had broken under the weight of vines which had become thick , leaning on and pinching the frail trellis ladders . I liked the garden in this wild state , the elastic fig trees strangling the palms , the roots of the white-blossomed frangipanis cracking the stone benches and showing knuckles between the cobblestones . And the vines , now more powerful than the trellises that had once supported them , needed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walled front entrance to the verandah , where there were pots of orchids hanging from wires , with gawking blossomsand damp dangling roots.  |p29The  bar itself stood in what was once a vast parlor , colored glazed tiles on the floor and a ceiling so high there were often some confused swallows flying in circles near the top . The windows were also large and Yardley said a swarm of bees flew in one day , passed over the heads of those drinking at the bar , and flew out the other side without disturbing a soul . The adjoining room we called the " lounge , " where there was a jumble of rattan furniture , a sofa , the piano Ogham used to play , and little tables and potted palms . No one sat there except the barman , Wallace Thumboo , when he was totting up the day 's chits at midnight , sorting them into piles according to the signatures . I was seeing the Bandung now with Leigh 's eyes , and I could understand his discomfort , but I did n't share it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Do I smell cats ? " He wrinkled his nose . " I was in Hong Kong a few years back , " said Yardley . " My towkay sent me up to get some estimates on iron sheeting . I was supposed to stay for a month , until the auction , but after two days I came back . Could n't stick the place . They treated me like dirt . Told the towkay the deal was up the spout . Ever been to Hong Kong , Froggy ? " Frogget said yes , it was awful . " What 's the beer like ? " Smale asked Leigh . " My dear fellow , " said Leigh , " I have n't the remotest idea . " That annoyed everyone , and Yardley said , " Got a right one ' ere . " At that point I was n't sure who I disliked more  --  Yardley for being rude to Leigh , or Leigh for spelling his name and saying " I have n't the remotest idea " to what was meant as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Yardley 's side . " Flowers , " said Leigh sharply , ignoring the others , " I thought you said we could get a drink here . " This magisterial " Flowers , " in front of my friends . Frog/get grinned , Smale winked and raised his glass to me , Yates frowned , and Yardley smirked as if to say , " You poor sufferingbastard "  --  all of this behind Leigh 's stiffened back . I knocked for Wally and ordered two gins . Leigh wrapped his hanky around his glass and drank disgustedly . It may have been anger or the heat , but Leigh was reddening and beads of sweat began percolating out of his face . Ordinarily , Yardley would have behaved the same as Gunstone and said , " Ever run into old So-and-So in Kowloon ? " which might have brought Leigh around . Or he would have told his story about the day the swarm of bees flew through the window , and if he was in a good mood he would have embellished it by imitating the bees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flapping his arms , and buzzing until he was breathless . " Bit stuffy in here , " Smale said . Yardley was looking at Leigh . Leigh seemed unaware that he had nettled Yardley . Yates said he had to go home and Yardley said , " I do n't blame you . " " Say good night to Flowers , " said Frogget . " Mister Flowers to you , Froggy , " I said . Yates left , saying good night to everyone by name , but omitting Leigh . Leigh said , " Tiffin time  --  is n't that what they call it here ? " Yardley had not taken his eyes off Leigh . I thought Yardley might sock him , but his tactic was different . He told his McCoy joke , the one he always told when there was a woman in the bar he wanted to drive out . It concerned four recruits being interviewed for the army . The sergeant asks them what they do for a living and the first one , saying his name 's McCoy , mutters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into sacks , you see " ) ; the next one , also a McCoy , is a cork soaker ( " soaks it in water , you understand " ) ; the third McCoy is a coke sacker ( " sacks coke for a dealer in fuel " ) ; and the last one , a mincing feller in satin tights , says that he 's the real McCoy . Yardley told it in several accents , lengthening itp31with slurs and pauses ( " What 's that you say ? " ) , and obnoxiouslyset it in Hong Kong . Leigh made no comment . He ordered a gin for himself , but none for me . " You giving up the booze , Jack ? " said Smale , who noticed . " A double , Wally , " I said . Yardley giggled . " I must have my tiffin , " he said . " Tiffin time , breh-heh , " said Frogget . " Take care of yourself , Jack , " said Yardley , and left with Frogget shambling after him . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thoughtful voice . He pressed down the lid of his cigarette can and said , " Say , Jack , what was the name of that skinny one you fixed me up with ? Gladys ? Gloria ? " I pretended not to hear . " Give me her number . God , she was a lively bit of crumpet . " He stared at Leigh and said , " She does marvelous things to your arse . " " Ask Wally , " I said . " It was like being dead , " said Smale , still addressing Leigh . He grinned . " You know . Paradise . " Wally was polishing glasses at the far end of the bar , smiling at the glasses as he smiled at the counter when he wiped it and at the gin bottle when he poured . Wally said , " What you want , Mr. Smale ? You want mushudge ? " He nodded . " Can . " " Aw hell , " said Smale . " Maybe I should forget it . I could have another double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down to the amusement park and play the pinball machines . What do you think ? " He leered at me , then snorted and sloped off . Leigh did not say anything right away . He climbed onto a barstool and dabbed at the perspiration on his upper lip with his finger . He looked at his finger , and feelingly , said , " How do you stand it ? " It made me cringe . It happened , this moment of worryp32when , hearing a question that never occurred to me , I discovered that I had an answer , as once in the Tai-Hwa on Cecil Street , a stranger wearing dark glasses asked , " Where you does wuck ? " and I remembered and was afraid.  |p33IN  MY CUBICLE , irritably dialing a third hotel , I heard Gopi coming . Then , in Singapore , disability determined the job ; Gopi , a cripple , was a peon from birth . He could be heard approaching by the sigh-shuffle-thump of his curious bike-riding gait . One leg was shorter than the other , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the good leg and making Gopi lean at a dangerous angle as he put his weight on it . A long step with his good leg checked his fall , and that was how he went , heaving along , dancing forward , swaying from side to side , like the standing dance of a man pumping a bike up a steep hill . Some years ago a horse named Gopi 's Dream ran an eight-furlong race at the Singapore Turf Club . I was not a member of that club , but two dollars got me into the grandstandwith the howling mob ; and it was there that I spent at least one afternoon of every race meeting . I had just arrived and was getting my bearings when I saw that the horse I had picked for the first race had been scratched . There were poor odds on all the others except Gopi 's Dream , and the logic of choosing this horse was plain to me . I putp34ten dollars on him to win , though my usual bet was a deuce on a long shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed into my hands as the ponies leaped down the homestretch . I told myself that half the bet was Gopi 's Deepavali present . Gopi 's Dream won , as all horses do when the logic is irrefutable , and it paid two hundred dollars ; half I put away for Gopi , the rest I lost in the course of the afternoon . The next day I took Gopi to a shop over on Armenian Street and had him fitted for a brace and a boot with a fiveinchsole . He was a bit rocky on it at first , but soon he got the hang of it and instead of his cyclist 's swaying he learned a jerking limp , dragging the enormous boot and clumping it ahead of him and then chasing it with the other leg . The brace clinked and the boot gave out long twisting squeaks . The odd thing was that although he walked fairly straight he walked much more slowly , perspiring and pulling and swinging the boot along . He stopped wearing the apparatus . He told me in Malay that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at the cobblers being put right . After a week I asked him about it ; he started wearing it  --  two days of clinks and squeaks , then he stopped . I asked why . It was biting . The brace was a greater affliction than the limp , a cure more painful than the ailment ; the incident cured me of certain regrets . " All full up , " the voice was saying to me over the phone . Gopi peddled over and I slammed the receiver into its cradle . " Hupstairs , " said Gopi , pointing his slender finger to indicate that Leigh was in Hing 's office . He clamped his tongue at the side of his mouth and scribbled in an invisible ledger to show he had seen Leigh writing . Then he asked me about Leigh : Who was he ? Where was he from ? Did he have children ? Was he a Eurasian ? I told Gopi what I knew and asked what time Leigh had arrived.  | " Seven-something . " That was news . As an eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I did a good job I had a chance for promotion , I used to come in at seven-something , too . By the time Hing rolled in I was already in a sweat , saying " Right you are , Mr. Hing , " and " Just leave it to me . " There was no promotion . I asked for Christmas off ; Hing said , " I am Buddhist , but wucking on Besak Day , birthday of Buddha , is n't it ? " I started to come in at eight-something and never said " Leave it to me , " and after I made a go of my enterprise it was ten before I showed my face . I would not be promoted , but neither would I be sacked : he could never have gotten another ang moh for what he paid me . In the acceptanceof this continuing meekness , the denial of any ambition , was an unvarying condition of enduring security and the annual promise of a renewed work permit . It was an angle , but it cost me my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounge said , " Go on , Jack , have another one , " I was happy ; I had the satisfaction of having earned my reward . The reminder that the drink would never have been offered if I had n't had a girl in tow was something that did n't worry me unless a feller like Leigh woke up my scruplingwith , " How do you stand it ? " A feller who lived in Singapore and knew me would never have asked that . The real question was not how but why . My answer would have unstrung him , or anyone . Leigh was eager to please Hing  --  that was plain . He had not found out it was no use . And who was he , this accountantfrom Hong Kong ? A clerkly fugitive , laying low after an incautious embezzlement in London ? Sacked by a British bank for interfering with a woman in Fixed Deposits , or for incompetence ; and like many ang mohs in the East , seeking cover in a Chinese shop , consoling himself with clubby fantasies and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern , an alien at a great distance , the bird of passagep36who mentioned from time to time when things got rough that there was always Australia ? He had lied about his clubs  --  the first time anyone had tried that on me  --  but so had I , three times over . It could not be held against him . The feeling I had for him was an inward clutching at self-pity . There was so much I could have told him if only he had been friendly and stopped calling me Flowers . Go away and save yourself , I wanted to say ; I could have watched him do that and watching him given myself hope . I had my girls ; I knew the limits of employment ; I had faith in extraordinarykinds of rescue , miraculous recoveries ; I knew a thing or two about love . What was his alternative ? I decided to watch him closely , this version of myself ; his nervy question still rankled , and pity prevented me from asking him the same . He was not aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , shoulders heaving . His arms did not swing or give him motion . They dangled uselesslyas he pedaled . He was a small man , and sometimes I believed that without him I would have floundered . I dialed another hotel for Gunstone and got another refusal . That was the last of his Victoria Street favorites . It was nearly lunchtime , so I called the Belvedere . I was at the airport , I told the receptionist , and did they have an airconditioneddouble room for one night ? " All our rooms  --  we got eight hundred plus  --  they are all air-conditioned , " she said . " That 's very nice , " I said , and made the reservation . " If Hing asks , " I told Gopi , leaving him holding the can as usual  --  but who except the meekest man would hold it ?  --  " tell him I 'm down with the flu . " Since it was going to be lunch at the Tanglin , then off to the Belvedere , I thought I 'd better change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gunstone asked . " My others are at the cleaners , " I said , still rolling " I'vep37just come from a funeral " around on my tongue . He would have asked who died , or perhaps have been spooked by the announcement . I had the fluent liar 's sense of proportion and foresight . Gunstone was calmed . Lunch was the Friday special , my favorite , seafood buffet . I followed Gunstone , taking the same things he did , in the same amounts , and I soon realized that I was heaping my plate with oysters and prawns , which I liked less than the crab and lobster Gunstone took in two small helpings . I put some oysters back and got a frown from the Malay chef . At the table I said , " I hope I have n't boobed , Mr. Gunstone , but I 've fixed you up at the Belvedere this afternoon . " He stabbed a prawn and peeled off the shell and dunked the naked finger of pink meat into a saucer of chili paste . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have we , Jack ? " " The other places were full , " I said . " Quite all right , " he said . " But I ate at the Belvedere last week . It was n't much good , you know . " " Oh , I know what you mean , Mr. Gunstone , " I said . " That food is perfectly hideous . " " Exactly , " said Gunstone . " How 's your salmon ? " I had not started to eat . I took a forkful , smeared it in mayonnaise , and ate it . " Delicious , " I said . " Mine 's awful , " he said , and he pushed his salmon to the side of his plate . " Now that you mention it , " I said , " it does taste rather  --  " " Desiccated , " said Gunstone . " Exactly , " I said . I pushed my salmon over to the side and covered it with a lettuce leaf . I was sorry ; I liked salmon the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreadful , too , " said Gunstone a moment later . I was just emptying a large claw . It was excellent , andp38I ate the whole claw before saying , " Right again , Mr. Gunstone . Tastes like they fished it out of the Muar River . " " We 'll shunt that over , shall we ? " said Gunstone . He moved a lobster tail next to the discarded salmon . I did the same , then as quickly as I could ate all my crab salad before he could say it was bad . I gnawed a hard roll and started on the oysters . " The prawns are a success , " he said . " The oysters are  --  " I did n't want to finish the sentence , but Gunstone was no help "  --  sort of limp . " " They 're cockles , actually , " said Gunstone . " And they 're a damned insult . Steward ! " A Malay waiter came over . " Take this away . " Demanding that food be sent back to the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by people who use that word . I admired people who did it , but could not imitate them . " Yours , Tuan ? " asked the waiter . " Yes , take it away , " I said sadly . " Want more , Tuan ? " the waiter asked Gunstone . " If I wanted more would I be asking you to remove that plate ? " Gunstone said . The waiter slid my lunch away . I buttered a hard roll and ate it , making crumbs shower down the front of my suit . " That steward , " said Gunstone , shaking his head . " The most intelligent thing I ever heard him say was , If you move your lump of ice cream a bit to the right , Tuan , you will find a strawberry . ' God help us . " I laughed and brushed my jacket . " Still , " I said , " I would n't mind joining this club . " " You do n't want to join this club , " said Gunstone . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun , by the pool , and one of those tanned long-legged women whispering urgently , " Jack , where have you been ? I 've been looking everywhere for you . It 's all set . " " Why , whatever for ? "  | " A place to go , I suppose , " I said . The Bandung 's only publicity was the matchboxes Wallace Thumboo had printed with the slogan , There 's Always Someone You Know at the Bandung ! Gunstone chuckled . " If they can pronounce your name you can join . " " Flowers is pretty easy . " " I should say so ! " But Fiori is n't , I thought . And Fiori was my name , Flowers an approximation and a mask . " Now , " said Gunstone , looking at his watch , " how about dessert ? " Gunstone 's joke : it was time to fetch Djamila . The old-timers , I found , tended to prefer Malays , while the newcomers went for the Chinese , and the Malays preferredeach other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked the big-boned Australian girls ; Germans were fond of Tamils , and the English fellers liked anything young , but preferred their girls boyish and their women mannish . Britishsailors from H.M.S. Terror enjoyed fighting each other in the presence of transvestites . Americans liked clean sporty ones , to whom they would give nicknames , like " Skeezix " and " Pussycat " ( the English made an effort to learn the girl 's real name ) , and would spend a whole afternoon trying to teach one of my girls how to swim in a hotel pool , although it was costing them fifteen dollars an hour to do it . Americans also went in for a lot of hugging in the taxi , smooching and kidding around , and sort of stumbling down the sidewalk , gripping the girl hard and saying , " Aw , honey , whoddle ah do ? " Later they wrote them letters , and the girls pestered me to help them reply . Djamila  --  " Jampot , " an American feller used to call her , and it suited her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waiting by the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank with my trusty suitcase as we pulled up in the taxi . I hopped out and opened the door for her , then got into the front seatp40and put the suitcase between my knees . Djamila climbed in with Gunstone and sat smiling , rocking her handbag in her lap . Smiling is something girls with buck teeth seldom do with any pleasure ; Djamila showed hers happily , charming things , very white in her broad mouth . She had small ears , a narrow moonlit face , large darting eyes , and heavy eyebrows . A slight girl , even skinny , but having said that one would have to add that her breasts were large and full , her bum high and handsome as a pumpkin . Her breasts were her virtue , the virtue of most of my Malay girls ; unlike the Chinese bulbs that disappeared in a frock fold , these were a pair of substantial jugs , something extra that moved and made a rolling wobble of her walk . That was the measureof acceptable size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , each responding to the step of Djamila 's small feet . Her bottom moved on the same prompting , but in a different rhythm , a wonderful agitation in the willowy body , a glorious heaving to and fro , the breasts nodding above the black lace of the tight-waisted blouse , the packed-in bum lifting , one buttock pumping against the other , creepingaround her sarong as she shuffled , showing her big teeth . " Jack , you looking very smart , " said Djamila . " New suit and what not . " " I put it on for you , sweetheart , " I said . " This here 's Mr. Gunstone , an old pal of mine . " Djamila shook his hand and said , " Jack got nice friends . " " Where 's that little car of yours , Jack ? " Gunstone asked . " It packed up , " I said . " Being fixed . " " What 's the trouble this time ? " " Suspension , I think . Front end sort of shimmies , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the way with those little French cars . Problems . It 's the workmanship . " The taxi pulled up in front of the Belvedere . The doormanin a top hat and tails snatched the door open and letp41Gunstone out . I handed over the suitcase ; it was a good solid Antler , a sober pebbly gray , filled with copies of the Straits Times and an R.A.F. first-aid kit , a useful item  --  once we had to use the tourniquet on a Russian seaman , and the little plasters were always handy for scratches . " You should get yourself a Morris , " said Gunstone at the reception desk . I could not answer right away because I was signing my name on the register and the clerk was welcoming me with a copy of What 's On in Singapore . I was not worried about being asked about Gunstone and Djamila ; anything is possiblein a big expensive hotel , and the accommodating manager will always smile and say he remembers you . In the elevator I said , " Yes , your Morris is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Djamila . The elevator boy and the bellhop stared at her . My girls looked fine , very pretty in bars and on the street , but in well-lighted hotels they looked different , not out of place , but prominent and identifiable . " I hate these American cars , " said Gunstone . " So do I , " I said . " Waste of money . " " Nice and big , " said Djamila . She gave a low throaty laugh . Most of my girls had bad throats : it was the line of work , all those germs . " Here you are , sah . Seven-o-five , " said the bellhop . He followed us in and swung the suitcase over to a low table ; I could hear the newspapers shift inside . He started his spiel about the lights and if there 's anything you want , but I interrupted him , pressing fifty cents into his hand , and he took off . " Your lights , " I said , discovering the switch and turning them all on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors , as the bellhop would have done if I had given him a chance . " Your TV , your washroom , window blinds , radio  --  " switching that on I got a melody from Doctor Zhivago . " I think everything is in order . "  | " You could n't do better than a Morris , " said Gunstone . He came over to me and said , " What 's she like ? " in a whisper . " Very rewarding , " I said . " Very rewarding indeed . " Djamila was sitting on the edge of the large double bed , removing her silver bracelets . She did it with dainty grace , admiring her arm and showing herself her fingernails as she pulled each bracelet past them . Gunstone , on a stuffed chair , sighed and twisted off one of his shoes . He had pulled off a sock and was intently poking the limp thing into the empty shoe , pushing at the balledupsock with his trembling finger , when I said : " I 'll leave you two to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The elevator boy , seeing the feller he had just deposited on that floor , looked away from me , at the button he was punching , and I could tell from the movement of his ears and a peculiar tightening of a section of scalp on the back of his head that he had summed up the situation and was grinning foolishly . I felt like socking him . " What 's your name ? " " Tony-lah , " he said . A person sobers up when he has to tell a stranger his name . " Here you are , Tony . " I handed him a dollar . " Do n't blab , " I said . " Nobody likes a blabber . " That dollar would have come in handy , and I could have saved it if I had gone down the fire stairs , which was what I usually did . But seven flights of dusty-smelling unpainted cement was more than a man my age should tolerate . A little arithmetic satisfied me that I could afford one drink ; in the Belvedere lounge-bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I nipped into the lounge , found a cool leather armchair , and sat very happily for a few minutesreading What 's On and looking up every so often to admire the decor . Yardley and the rest did not think much of the new Singapore hotels  --  too shiny and tacky , they said , no character at all . Character was weevils in your food , metal folding chairs , and a grouchy barman who insulted youp43as he overcharged you ; it was a monsoon drain that had n't been cleared for months and a toilet  --  like the one in the Bandung  --  located in the middle of the kitchen . Someday , I thought , I 'm going to reserve a room at the Belvedere and burrow in the blankets of a wide bed  --  the air conditioner on full  --  and sleep for a week . The ground floor of the Belvedere was Italian marble and there was a chandelier hanging in the lobby that must have taken years to make . I was enjoying myself in the solid comfort , sipping my gin , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spilling out of conches , gilded sea urchins and fingers of coral ; but I became anxious . It was not my habitual worry about Gunstone 's engine failing . It was the annoying suspicion that the seven or eight tourists there in the lounge were staring in my direction . They had seen me come in with Gunstone and Djamila and like Tony they had guessed what I was up to . The ones who were n't laughing at me despised me . If I had been younger they would have said , " Ah , what a sharp lad , a real operator  --  you 've got to hand it to him " ; but a middleagedman doing the same thing was a dull dirty procurer . I tried to look unruffled , crossing my legs and flicking through the little pamphlet . Recrossing my legs I felt an uncommon breeze against my ankles : I was n't wearing any socks . How could I be so stupid ? There I was in the lounge of an expensive hotel , wearing my black Ah Chum worsted , a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a high gloss  --  and sockless ! That was how they knew my trade , by my nude ankles . I wanted to leave , but I could n't without calling attention to myself . So I sat in the chair in a way which made it possible for me to push at the knees of my pants and lower my cuffs over my ankles . I tried to convince myself that these staring tourists did n't matter  --  they 'd all be on the morning flight to Bangkok . I lifted my drink and caught a lady 's eye . She lookedp44away . Returning to my reading , I sensed her eyes drift over to me again . You never knew with these American ladies ; they made faces at each other in public , sometimes hilarious ones , a sisterly foolishness . The other people began staring . They were making me miserable , ruining the only drink I could afford . The embarrassment was Leigh 's doing ; the stranger had called my vocation " poncing . " " Telephone call for Bishop Bradley . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over the loud-speaker in the lounge , a cloth-faced box on the wall above a slender palm in a copper pot . No one got up . Two ladies looked at the loud-speaker . It stopped , the voice and the hum behind it ; there was and expectant pause in the lounge , everyone holding his breath , knowing the announcement would start again in a moment , which it did , monotonously . " Bishop Bradley . . . Telephone call for Bishop Bradley .. Now no one was looking at the loud-speaker . I had fastened all the buttons on my black suit jacket . I stood up and turned an impatient face to the repeated command coming from the cloth-faced box . I swigged the last of my gin and with the eyes of those people upon me , strode out in my clerical-looking garb in the direction of the information desk . I knew I had made them sorry for staringat my sockless feet , for judging my action at the desk , and There goes the bishop , they were saying . Outside I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the while blaming Leigh for this new behavior of mine , embarrassment and fumbling shame making me act strangely . His shadow obscured my way : I wanted him to go.  |p45IT  WAS EARLY lighted evening , that pleasant glareless time of day just before sunset ; the moon showed in a blue sky  --  a pale gold sickle on its back  --  and it was possible to stroll through the mild air without hunching over and squinting away from the sun . It was the only hour when the foliage was not tinged with hues of sickly yellow ; trees were denser , green , and cool . All the two-story Chinese houses set in courtyards along Cuppage Road had their doors and green shutters open for the breeze , and there was a sense of slowed activity , almost of languor , that the sight at dusk of men in pajamas  --  the uniform of the peaceloving  --  produces in me . A formation of swallows dived into view , pivoted sharply like bats , and then chased , lurching this way and that , toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cloud poured this brightness into a subdued rosy wash . The palms towering above the Bandung did not sway  --  they never did in Singapore  --  but I could hear the papery rattle of the fronds shaking , hearing a coolness I could n't feel . To a northern-born American , the palm tree was when I was growing up , a graceful symbol of wealth : it suggested lushp46Florida , sunny winter vacations , certain movie stars and long days of play , white stucco hotels and casinos on wide beaches , and fresh fruit all year round ; fellers had fun under nature 's parasol . I looked up at the Bandung 's palms , a tree I no longer associate with fun , so as to avoid looking at the top of the stockade wall enclosing the garden ; on top of the wall glass shards were planted to discourage intruders and the sight of these bristling never failed to make my pecker ache . I crunched down the cobblestone path , under the tunnel of vines , in the comfortable damp of the freshly watered garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bandung and was now dazzling at the back door , shooting brilliant gold streaks through two rooms , along the ground floor on the gleaming tiles . My jacket sat well on me for the first time that day , and with Gunstone 's envelope of cash in my breast pocket , I was cool and happy . But I knew what I was in for : I quailed when I heard Yardley 's angry whoop of abuse echo in the big room . I paused near the wicker chairs on the verandah , and for a hopeless fluid moment I wished there was somewhere else I could go . It was n't possible . A man my age , for whom a bar was a habit and a consolation  --  a reassurance of communitythat could nearly be tender  --  a man my age did n't drink in strange bars ; that meant an upsetting break in routine ; my friends interpreted absence as desertion , and they did not forgive easily . It would have seemed especially suspicious if I had avoided the Bandung after being responsible for bringingLeigh there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Yardley 's last joke was proof of that . The blame was mine and an explanation was expected of me . I had come prepared to denounce Leigh . Yardley saw me and stopped whooping . Frogget was beside him ; Smale , Yates , and Coony were at the bar , and over in an armchair drinking soybean milk and absorbed in the Reader 's Digest sat old Mr. Tan Lim Hock . Mr. Tan , a retiredcivil servant , helped the regulars at the Bandung withp47their income tax  --  " He can skin a maggot , " Yardley said . He was a rather tense man whom I had seen smile only twice : once , when he saw what Hing paid me ( " Is this per mensem or per annum ? " he asked ) , and once  --  that day in 1967  --  when China exploded her H-bomb . I crossed the tiles and ordered a gin . Yardley 's defiant silence , and the sheepishness on the faces of the rest , told me what I had expected : that Leigh was the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Are you alone ? " asked Yardley . Yates and Coony looked at him as if they expected him to continue , but all he said when I told him I was alone was , " Wally nearly got pranged this afternoon . Is n't that right , Wally ? Got a damned great bruise on his arm . Show us your bruise again , Wally , come on . Wally , at the center of attention , was uncomfortable . " Not too bad , " he said , smiling at his bandaged elbow . " That 's not what you told me ! " said Yardley . He turned to me . " Poor little sod nearly got killed ! " Yardley was maddened ; ordinarily , Wally 's injury would not have mattered to him  --  he might even have mocked it  --  but Yardley was in a temper , and his anger about Leigh , which I had deflectedby barging in , had become a general raging . It was at times like this that he called Frogget " Desmond " instead of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had attached himself to Yardley and like Wally simplified his loyalty by surrenderingto abuse for praise ) ; and it was only in anger that Yardley remembered I was an American . " It 's these bloody taxis , " said Yates  --  the " bloody " was for Yardley 's benefit . Yates was a quiet soul , the only one of us who did not work for a towkay . He got what were called " perks , " home leave every two years , education and family allowances , and could look forward to a golden handshake and one hundred cubic feet of sea freight . " No , it 's not , " said Yardley . " It 's these jumped-up bastardsp48who come here and act like they own the road . " He stared at me . " You know the kind , do n't you , Jack ? " " I see them now and again , " I said . " Who was it , Wally ? Was it a Chink that ran you down ? " Mr. Tan Lim Hock was ten feet away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Wally , blinking and gasping at his own recklessness . " He did n't hit me , I fell . Assident . " " He hit you , you silly shit , " said Yardley . " I knew it was a European , and I 'll bet he does n't live in Singapore either . No sir , not him . Would n't dare . Take someone like that friend of yours , Jack  --  " Yardley began blaming Leigh for Wally 's bruise . Not so incredible : a month earlier , in a similar series of associations , after he had been overcharged by the Singapore Water Board on an item marked " sewer fee , " he flung the crumpled bill in Wally 's face and said , " There 's no end to the incompetenceof you fuckers . " Now , Yardley worked himself up into such a lather that soon he was saying  --  ignoring Wally and the bruise  --  " That pal of yours , that shifty little bastard would run down the lot of us if we gave him half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps bringing him in here I 'm going to stay home  --  nothing against you , Jack , but you should know better . Wally , for God 's sake look alive and give me a double . " " Let me explain , " I said . They did n't know the half of it ; I could tell them Leigh 's lie about his club , the airport story about " What ship your fiend flom ? " and how he had suggestedwe go see Hing before having a drink ( " Arse licker ! " Yardley would have cried ) . But I flubbed it before I began by saying , " William arrived yesterday , and where else  --  " " William ? " Yardley looked at me . " You call that little maggot William ? Well , I 'll be damned . " He shook his head . " Jack , do n't be a sucker . Even bloody Desmond can see that bugger 's jumped-up , and he knows you 're a Yank so he canp49get away with telling you he 's governor general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 'm telling you he 's so shifty the light does n't strike him . " " I hear he 's a nasty piece of work , " said Coony . " He 's all fart and no arse , " said Smale , who then mimicked Leigh , saying , " I have n't the remotest idea . " " He 'd try the patience of a bloody saint , " said Yardley . " Why do n't you lay off him , " I said , surprising myself with the objection . " Jack likes him , " said Yardley . " Do n't he , Desmond ? " " Yeah , " said Frogget , turning away from me and rubbing his nose which in profile was a snout . " I fancy he does . " " I do n't , " I said , and although I had planned a moment earlier to denounce Leigh , I hated myself for saying it . When I first saw Leigh at the airport I had an inkling  --  a tic of doubt that made me want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw me . Now I understood that tic , and whatever I might say about Leigh did not matter : I could prove my dislike to these fellers at the bar facing me , but there was no way I could make myself believe it . It was not very complicated . Middle age is a sense of slipping and decline , and I suppose I had my first glimpse of this frailty in Leigh , the feeling of the body growing unreliable , getting out of control in a mournfully private way  --  only the occupierof the body could know . Once , I might have said , " He 's all fart and no arse , " but hearing it from Smale was a confirmation of my fear . The ridicule involved me  --  it was fear , and I was inclined now to defend the stranger , for hearinghim ridiculed I knew how others ridiculed me ; defendinghim was merciful , but it also answered a need in myself by providing me with a defense . It was so simple . But the peril of being over fifty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinging to transparent deceptions . We let others confirm what we already know , and we get mad because they say it ; what appears like revelationp50is the calling of a desperate bluff : the young wiseacre who , starting his story , says , " This feller was really old , about fifty or sixty  --  " drives every listener over fifty up the wall . We knew it before he said it . What is aggravating is not that the wiseacre knows , but that he thinks it 's important and holds it against us . Our only defense is in refusing to laugh at his damned joke . So : " He 's not here , " I said , " and it 's not fair to talk behind his back . " " Look who 's talking about being fair ! " said Yardley . He had overcome his colicky anger and was laughing at me . " Who is it that imitates the maggot skinner when his back is turned ? " It was true ; I did . When Mr. Tan left the bar I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Digest and bottle of Vimto soybean milk . I looked over and was glad to see that Mr. Tan had gone home ; Yardley 's " Chink " had done it . My other routines were Wally polishing glasses , Frogget 's shambling , and Yardley , drunk , forgetting the punch line of a joke . My imitations were not very accurate , but my size and panting determination made the attempt funny . Mimicryreassures the weak , and the envious fool takes the risk as often as the visionary who mocks the error and leaves the man alone ; I did not like to be reminded by my brand of mimicry . " I 'm turning over a new leaf , " I said . " By wearing a suit ? " Smale asked . Of course . I had forgotten I was wearing a suit . That bothered them most of all . They were sensitive about fellers who dressed up and made a bluff of the success they felt was denied everyone because it was denied them . " I had to go to a funeral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled up my shirt-sleeves . I knew instantly what Yardley 's next words would be . He said : " Do n't tell me your friend 's packed it in ! "  | " That 'd be a ruddy shame , " said Smale . " Let 's drop it , shall we ? " I said . After all my indignant sympathy that was the only rebellion I could offer . Then Leigh walked in . I heard Gopi 's characteristic trampling of the cobbled path in the garden , his whisper , and Leigh 's , " Ah , yes , here we are , " and my heart quickened . " Long time no see , " said Yardley . Leigh brightened ; but Yardley was beckoning to Gopi and ordering Gopi a drink . " How you doing ? " said Yardley , putting his arm around the peon . " There you are , " said Leigh . I winced at the demonstration of pretended relief . Leigh glanced at the others and said , " ' d evening " and " M'ellew . " " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a good chap . " Gopi had a whiskey in his hand . He drank it all and at once his eyes glazed , his face went ashen and matched his caste mark . " Leave him alone , " I said . " Gopi , do n't drink if you 're not in the mood . " " He 's going to be sick , " said Coony . " I like this little chap 's company , " said Yardley . It was his revenge on Leigh . " Have another one ? " Gopi nodded , but he was not saying yes . He covered his face with a hanky and pedaled to the door . Outside , in the garden , he became loud , hawking and spitting . " The call of the East , " said Smale . Gopi groaned , and dragged himself away . " That was mighty nice of you , " I said to Yardley . " He 'll be all right , " Yardley muttered , and turned away , saying , " Now , where was I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing ? " asked Leigh . " Anyone I can , " I said . " That clerk of yours very kindly showed me the way here . Poor chap 's got a sort of gammy leg , has n't he , and I was a bitp52sorry he had to  --  " Leigh was still talking about Gopi 's lameness , but he was not looking me in the eye . He stared at my tattoos , the ones on my left arm , and in particular at the long blue crucifix crowned with a circle of thorns dripping inverted commas of blood onto my wrist . I pressed my right to my side as soon as I saw him fasten on the left . " He 's a wonderful feller , " I said . " Minds his own business . " I reached for my drink and when I lifted it his gaze lifted until it met my own . He looked tired . He had been hard at work all day , probably sitting in that low chair in Hing 's office , out of range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slapped at papers on his desk . Leigh 's eyes were watery and his hair was stuck to his head with sweat ; the floridness of his face , which had looked like ruddy good health the day before , was not a solid color , but rather many little veins and splotches . I looked at him as at a picture in a newspaper that goes insubstantial with closeness , the face blurred to a snowfall of dots . " How do the accounts look ? " I asked , handing Leigh a tumbler of gin . " Bit ropey , " said Leigh . " Any of the pink stuff ? " Wally shook some drops of Angostura into the gin . " That 'll put lead in your pencil , " I said . " Best to put it in the glass before the gin and work it around the sides , " said Leigh . He wrapped the glass in his hanky , said , " Cheers , " and drank . " I do n't mind telling him to get knotted , " Yardley was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips . " We 'll sort it out , though if you ask me , your towkay 's missing a few beads from his abacus . " " He 'll drive you out of your gourd , " I said . " Funny little thing , is n't he ? I ca n't understand a word he says . " " What about your towkay  --  in Hong Kong ? " I asked  | " Him ! " Leigh gathered his features solemnly together and said , " In actual fact . . . he 's a cunt . " Yardley heard and smiled , and I wondered for a moment whether the obscenity would redeem Leigh . It did n't . Yardleycontinued to talk to the fellers on my right , and sometimes to me ; Leigh spoke only to me . I was , awkwardly , in the middle , a zone of good humor . There was no way out of it ; to skip off with Leigh would mean the end of my drinkingat the Bandung ; the desertion would prohibit my return . Soon Yardley was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talkative on his third drink. "  --  God , sometimes I hate it , " Leigh said . " One thinks one is going to the tropics and one finds oneself in the Chineseversion of Welwyn Garden City . The call of the East indeed  --  your friend over there was right . That fantastic hoicking puts me off my food , it really does . Still , it wo n't be much longer . " " How long do you plan to stay in Hong Kong ? " " My dear fellow , " said Leigh , " not a moment longer than is absolutely necessary . " In different words , for fourteen years I 'd said the same thing to myself ; it was an ambiguous promise , and when I said it , it sounded like never . But Leigh 's sounded like soon . " Margaret  --  my wife  --  Margaret 's got a magnificent cottagepicked out . In Wiltshire  --  you know it ? Fantastic place . When I go all broody about the Chinese , Margaret looks at me and says , We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cottage . That cheers me up . And then I do n't feel so bad about  --  " The name depressed me ; it sounded like the name of an old folks ' home , and I imagined an overheated parlor , a radio playing too loud , an elderly inmate snoring in an armchair , another in a frilly apron busying himself with a dustpan and brush , and a young heavy nurse patiently feeding a protestingcrone who was wearing a blue plastic bib and battingp54the spoon away with her hand . Just saying the name lifted Leigh 's spirits ; he was still talking about the cottage. "  --  thought of doing a little book about my experiences . Call it Hong Kong Jottings and pack it with sampans and chatter from the club , that sort of thing . I see myself at Elmviewon a spring morning , in the front room , sun splashing through the window , working on this book . In longhand , of course . Outside I can see masses of bluebells and a green meadow . " He sighed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds  --  " I could not think of another way of saying it  --  " very agreeable . " " You know , " he said , " I 've never set foot in that cottage . I saw it from a motorcar ; Margaret pointed it out from the road . It was raining . We had a ploughman 's lunch in the village  --  beautiful old pub  --  and went back to London that same afternoon . But it 's as if I 've been living there my whole life . I can tell you the position of every stick of furniture , every plate , how the sun strikes the carpet . I can see the tea things arranged on the table , and there 's that  --  " he sniffed  --  " curious stale smell of cold ashes in the grate . " Yardley used to say , " Everyone in the tropics has a funkhole , " and Leigh had told me his ; his description had taken the curse off the name  --  the place was happy , a credible refuge . I had my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had kept my imaginings to myself and added little details now and then over the years . Maybe I had had one gin too many , or it might have been my triumphant feeling over that Bishop Bradley business . Whatever it was  --  it might have been Leigh 's candor magnetizing mine  --  I drew very close to him and whispered , " It 's an odd thing , is n't it ? Everyone imagines a different funkhole . Take mine , for example . You know what I want ? " " Tell me , " said Leigh , sympathetically . " First , I want a lot of money  --  people do n't laugh at a feller with dough . Then I want a yacht that you can sleepp55on and a huge mansion with a fence or a wall around it and maybe a peacock in the garden . I 'd like to walk around all day in silk pajamas , and take up golf and give up these stinking cheroots and start smoking real Havana cigars . And that 's not all  --  " Leigh gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly I stuttered to a halt and finished my drink in a single gulp . He thought I was mocking him . The dream of mine , the little glimpse of fantasy that had widened into the whole possible picture I saw every day I spent on that island , saving my sanity as I obeyed Hing or turned my girls out or sorted pornographic pictures on the kitchen table in my house in Moulmein Green , hopeful and comforting in its detail , making me resourceful  --  that to him was mockery . He said , " Are you taking the mickey out of me ? " There was no way I could explain that I was perfectly serious . I saw it all coming to me quickly , like a jackpot I imaginedmyself winning : " Just a minute , " I would say to the fellersat the bar , and while everyone watched I would put a coin  --  say my last  --  into a one-arm bandit , yank the lever and watch the whirr become a row of stars as the machine exploded and roared , disgorging a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture , he had said ; I had not giggled  --  at that or the bluebells . I believed it because he did . But my version of Elmview , my own funkhole ( deep-sea fishing in a silk robe and a velvet fedora , with a cigar in my teeth ) made him mad . And what bothered me most was that I could not tell whether he felt mocked because my imaginings were grander than his or because they sounded absurd and he doubted them . I would not have minded his envy , but his doubt would have made my whole plan seem inaccessible to me by encouraging my own doubt . His grim expression made me say what I at once regretted : " I guess it sounds pretty crazy . " He did not hear me . Behind me , Yardley was horsingp56around , bawling a joke : " Organ , ' she says . That 's no organ , breh-heh ! Looks more like a flute to me ! ' " " I take it Singapore 's not a terribly expensive place to live , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " It 's probably more expensive than Hong Kong ! " " I 'm quite surprised , " he said , lifting his eyebrows . He took a sip of his drink . " Then the salaries here are n't very , urn , realistic . " " They 're not too bad , " I said . I even laughed a little bit . But I stopped laughing when I saw what he was driving at . " You mean Hing ? " He nodded and gave me the tight rewarded smile of a man who has just tasted something he likes . He said , " You 've got an amah 's salary . " " You 've got the wrong end of the stick , " I said . " If you think I bank on  --  " But I was ashamed , and flustered  --  and angry because he still wore that smile . He had spent the day in that upstairs cubicle examining my salary . What could I say ? That Gunstone had a few hours before thanked me with an envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Singapore , and was snooker champion of one ( unbeaten on the table at the Island Club ) , and knew a sultan who called me Jack and who had introduced me as his friend to Edmundde Rothschild at a party ? That once , on Kampong Java Road , where I had my own brothel , I cleared a couple of thousand after pilferage and breakage was settled ? That Edwin Shuck of the American embassy had told me that if it had not been for me Singapore would never have been used as a base for the GIs ' " R and R " and Paradise Gardens would not have existed ? That I had plans ? I hated him most when he said , with a concern that was contemptuous patronage , " How do you manage ? " My elbows were on the bar , my head in my hands . Far off on a green ocean I saw a yacht speeding toward me withp57its pennants snapping in the breeze . A man in a swivel chair on the afterdeck had his feet braced on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him a lovely girl in a swimsuit stood with a tray of drinks and  --  I knew  --  club sandwiches , fresh olives , dishes of rollmop herring , and caviar spread on yellow crackers . The fish leaped , a tall silverthing turning in the sun , whipping the line out of the water . The yacht was close and I could see the man now . It was not me ; it was no one I knew . I released my fingers from my eyes . " Flowers , " said Leigh . Why was he smiling ? " How about a drink at the club ? " My girls were fairly well known at the Bandung  --  " Jack 's fruit flies , " Yardley called them  --  but no one there had any knowledge of my club work , and how I came straight from the Churchill Room or the Raffles Grill to the Bandung like an unfaithful husband home from his beguiling mistress 's arms . I tried to whisper , " Maybe later . " Leigh looked beyond me to the others . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toilet ? " " In the kitchen , " said Coony , glad for a chance to say it . Wally pointed the way . " Does this establishment have a toilet ? " said Smale . He guffawed . I wondered if Leigh could hear . " Calls it a toilet , " said Yardley . " He knows it 's a crapper , but he calls it a toilet . That 's breeding , you understand . " Frogget went yuck-yuck . " What 's this club he 's talking about ? " asked Yardley suspiciously . I said I did n't have the remotest idea . " You sound more like him every day , " said Yardley . " Knock it off , " I said . " Do n't be narked , " said Smale . " He 's your mate , ai n't he ? " " He has n't bought anyone a drink yet , " said Coony . " I could tell he was a mean bastard . "  | " Did you hear him rabbiting on ? " asked Smale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pasture , " said Frogget . " That shows he 's around the twist . " They had heard . They had been talking the whole time but they had caught what Leigh had said about Elmview  --  a distorted version of it . I had whispered , confiding my hopes ; they could not have heard me . But why had I weakenedand told Leigh ? And who would he tell ? He was out of the room ; I wanted him to stay out , never to come back , and for his engine to gripe and stop his mouth . " He 's a pain in the neck , " I said , at last . " Been in the bog a little while , " said Smale . " What do you suppose he 's doing in there ? " " Probably tossing himself off , " said Frogget . " You 're a delicate little feller , " I said . No one said anything for a little while , but it was not what I had said to Frogget that caused the silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear in the bar . The only sounds were the fans on the ceiling and the murmuring of Wally 's transistor . We were drinking without speaking , and looking around in the way fellers do when they have just come into a bar ; Leigh might have crept back without pulling the chain . " So he 's doing your towkay 's accounts , " said Yardley . It was a meaningless remark , but for Yardley an extraordinary tone of voice : he whispered it . " It 's a very fiddly sort of job , " said Yates after a moment . " You really have to know what 's what . " " Takes ages to do those sums , " said Smale . " Our accountanttold me some days he looks at all those numbers and feels like cutting his throat . " " You have to pass an exam , " said Coony , staring toward the kitchen . " To be an accountant . It 's a bugger to pass . Iknow a bloke who failed it five times . Bright bloke , too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his earp59the way a child holds a seashell for the sound . He ordered drinks and when Wally set them up Yardley handed me two gins and a bottle of tonic water . " Pink one 's for your pal , " he said . He glanced toward the kitchen . " I would n't mind living in Wiltshire , " Smale said . He said it with reverent hope , and we continued talking like this , in whispers . I had not realized just how long Leigh had been gone until I saw that the ice in his pink gin had melted and my own glass was empty . I climbed down from the barstool and hurried into the kitchen . The toilet door was ajar , but Leigh was not inside . He was sitting on a white kitchen chair , by the back door , with his head between his knees . " William , " I said , " are you okay ? " He shook his head from side to side without raising it . " Get up and walk around a bit . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear me ?  --  the fresh air will do you a world of good . Can you get up ? " He groaned . The back of his neck was damp , the sick man 's sweat made his hair prickle ; his ears had gone white . I knew it was his engine . " He sick-lah , " said Wally , appearing beside me with the radio squawking in his hand . " Will you shut that fucking thing off ! " I screamed . I do not know why I objected or swore . " Get a doctor , and hurry ! " Wally jumped to the phone . Yardley and the others came into the kitchen as I was helpingLeigh up . Leigh 's face had a white horror-struck expression  --  wide unmoving nose holes  --  that of a man drowning slowly in many fathoms of water . I had seen these poor devilshoisted out of the drink : their mouths gaped open and they stared past you with anxious bugging eyes , as if they have acquired phenomenal sight , the ability to see far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a throng of ter/rors . Leigh looked that way ; he seemed about to whisper rather than scream . He was breathing : I saw a flutter in his throat , and a movement like a low bubble rise and fall in the declivity of his shoulder . We carried him into the lounge , stretched him out on the sofa , and put pillows under his head . I took off his watch ; it had made white roulettes on his wrist , perforations that would n't go away . He looked paler than ever , more frighteningin the posture of a corpse . But the worst part was when his legs came alive  --  just his legs , like a man having a tantrum  --  and his kicking heels made an ungodly clatter on the bamboo armrest of the sofa . " Christ , " said Coony , stepping back . Smale and Frogget clamped their hands on his ankles and held them down . The clattering stopped , but the silence after that weird noise was much worse . I was conscious of standing there with my tattooed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , and I heard a voice , Yardley 's , saying , " See that tatty sofa over in the lounge near the piano ? That 's where Jack 's mate from Hong Kong packed it in . It was the damnedest thing  --  " I turned to shut him up . But he was not talking ; he was standing , expressionless , holding Leigh 's drink , the pale pink gin in which all the ice had melted . He seemed to be offering it to Leigh and though he held the tumbler in two hands it was shaking . Leigh stared past us , at that looming thing very far off we could not see . I memorized his astonishment . It made us and the Bandung and everything on earth small and unimportant , not worth notice , and we were  --  for the time Leigh was on the sofa  --  as curious and baffled as those people on a city sidewalk who pass a man looking up at the sky and look up themselves but are made uneasy because they ca n't see the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner of speaking  --  by the act of dying  --  Leigh had the last word ; though toward the end we tried to take back the things we had said . I have a memory of the six of us dancing around that green sofa in the badly lighted lounge , before the doctor came and took him away , frantically attempting ways to revive him , to coax him back to life so that we could have another chance to be kind to him  --  or perhaps so that he could amend his last words , which had been " Does this establishment have a toilet ? " to something if less memorable , more dignified . Our reviving methods were the ineffectual kind we had learned from movies : lifting his eyelids ( why ? did we want to see the eye or not ? ) ; plumping his pillow ; unbuttoning his shirt ; pouring cold water over his face with the Johnnie Walker pitcher ; fitting an ice bag on his head like a tam-o ' - shanter , and lightly slapping his cheeks while asking persistentquestions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you hear me ? "  --  to which there were no replies . The doctor sensibly put a stop to this . " How did he get so wet ? " he asked as he knelt and swiftly tinkered with Leigh 's chest and shone a light in his eyes . He held Leigh'sp62wrist various ways and said , " It 's too late . " It sounded like a reproach for what I had whispered to Leigh  --  " Maybe later . " " A lot he cares , " said Smale , muffling what he had said with his hand and backing away from the doctor . " Is it all right to smoke ? " asked Coony . But he had already lit one , which was smoldering half-hidden in his cupped fingers . " One of you will have to come along with me , " said the doctor , ignoring Coony 's question . The doctor was Chinese , and I think what Smale held against him was his unclinical appearance ; he was wearing a bright sports shirt and Italian sandals . Yardley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to the next of kin , offering me the consideratesympathy they had lavished on William , as they had started calling him when he was on the sofa and , most likely , dead . We wore long faces  --  not sad because we liked him , but mournful because we hated him . Coony put his hand on my shoulder and said , " Are you okay , Jack ? " " I 'll be fine in a minute , " I said , becoming the grieving person they wanted me to be . " If there 's anything we can do , " said Yates . I put on my suit jacket and fixed my tie . I was dressed for a death , buttoning the black jacket over my stomach . " What are you going to tell his wife ? " asked Yardley . I stopped buttoning . " Wo n't the hospital tell her ? " It had not occurred to me until Yardley mentioned it that I would have to break the news to Leigh 's wife . " They 'll get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve and confided , " They 'll make it sound bloody awful . " " Do n't tell her it happened here , " said Coony quickly . " Say it happened somewhere else . " " During the day , " said Smale . " A sunny day . " " But in the shade , " said Coony , " of a big Angsana tree . Inp63the Botanical Gardens . While he was  --  " Coony hit his fist against his head . " While he was having a good time with the rest of us , " said Yardley . He looked from face to face . There was a long silence . The doctor was at the bar speakingon the telephone to the hospital . " Near the bandstand , " said Frogget . " Maybe he tried to climb that hill . And it was too hot . And his ticker gave out . " " We told him to stop , " said Yardley , sounding convinced . " But he would n't listen to us . Have it your way , ' we said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of something , " I said , cutting Yardley off . I did n't like this . It had all fallen to me . He was mine now , though I had tried several times to disown him . I had not wanted him ; I had disliked him from the moment he asked , " Flowers . . . are you a ponce ? " And his triumphant contempt : " How do you stand it ? " and " How do you manage ? " It was as if he had come all that way to ask me those questions , and to die before I could answer . The doctor clicked Leigh 's eyes shut , moving the lids down with his thumbs ; but the lids refused to stick and sightless crescents of white appeared under the lashes . We carried him to the doctor 's Volvo and folded him clumsily into the back seat . I sat beside him and put my arm around him to keep him from swaying . He nodded at every red light , and at the turning on River Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long have you been in Singapore ? " the doctor asked . It was a resident 's question . I told him how long . He did not reply at once ; I guessed I had been there longer than him . He drove for a while and then asked when I would be leaving . " Eventually , " I said . " Pretty soon . " " Have n't I seen you at the Island Club ? "  | " Yes , " I said . " I go there now and then , just to hack around . " " What 's your handicap ? " " My handicap , " I said . " I would n't repeat it in public . " The doctor laughed and kept driving . Leigh slumped against me . In my locked bedroom on Moulmein Green , late at night and so dog tired after driving one of my girls back to her house from a hotel that I collapsed into bed without pulling my pants off or saying my prayers , I had imagined death differently  --  not the distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something very close , death crowding me in the dark : a thing stirring in a room that was supposed to be empty . The feeling I got on one of those nights was associatedin my mind with the moment before death , the smotheringsound of the cockroach . A glossy cockroach , motionless , gummed to the wall by the bright light , goes into action when the light is switched off . It is the female which flies and its sound is the Chinese paper fan rapidly opening and closing . This fluttering dung beetle in the black room is circling , making for you . You listen in the dark and hear the stiff wings beating near your eyes . It is going to land on your face and kill you and there is nothing you can do about it . I did not imagine a moment of vision before death , but quite the reverse , blindness and that fatal burr of wings . Leigh 's eyes were not completely closed , the lids were ajar and the sulfurous streetlamps on Outram Road lit the gleamingwhites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinned an admission ticket to his shirt  --  number eighty-six , a lottery number for Mr. Khoo  --  and turned out his pockets : a few crumpled dollars , a withered chit , some loose change , a wallet containing calling cards , a picture of Margaret , a twenty-dollar Hong Kong note , and a folded receipt from the Chinese Emporium on Orchard Road . This went into a brown envelope.  | " We 'll need a deposit , " said the nurse . I took out Gunstone 's envelope , Singapore Belvedere , and handed over fifteen dollars . How do you manage ? " Please fill up this form , " she said . The form was long and asked for information I could not provide without Leigh 's passport . So with the matron 's permissionI went back to the Strand by taxi , told the desk clerk that Leigh was dead , and picked up the passport . " It seems like only yesterday that he checked in , " the desk clerk said ; he assured me that he would take care of everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copying Leigh 's full name , home address , nearest relation , race , and age  --  he was a year younger than me ; the pen shook in my hand  --  Leigh was staring out of the chilly morgue drawer ; after the autopsyhe looked much the same , though unzipped , he fixed on that distant thing with the single eye the autopsy left him . I had forgotten Leigh 's suitcase . After the certificate of death had been made out I picked up the case at the Strand , and at my insistence the taxi driver detoured past the Bandung . As we went past I could see lights burning and Yardley , Frogget , Smale , and the others at the bar , like lost old men , vagrants huddled around a fire late at night , sharing a bottle , afraid to go to bed . It was after midnight . I did not have the heart to wake up Leigh 's wife and get her out of bed to tell her she was a widow . I locked my door , put a match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mosquito coil , lighted to suffocate the gnats and drive the cockroaches away , smoked like a joss stick . I blinked in the fumes and tried to pray ; the first words that came to me were , Is this all ? The next day I awoke as if after a binge , with that feeling of physical and mental fragility , exposure , distraction  --  the knowledge of having done something shameful which refusesto be summoned up : of having revealed my closest secretwhich now everyone knew except me ! And then I re/membered Leigh , not as a corpse ; it was an uncharitable intrusive thought , something connected with the smile he wore when he had asked , " How do you manage ? " A picture of his dead face followed . So more as an act of penance than out of any curiosity , I opened his suitcase and picked through it . Each thing I found made me sad ; nothing was concealed . There were tags and labels on the case , the traveler 's campaign ribbons , KHAO YAI MOTOR LODGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag from the airline with the destination letteredSIN . Here was a sock with a hole in the toe , a pathetic little sewing kit , some salt tablets , a packet of Daraprim , very wrinkled pajamas with a white-piping border , his human smell still upon them . In a paper bag from the Chinese Emporiumthere were a set of screwdrivers , a new shaving brush , some Lucky Brand razor blades . There was a wrapped parcel of batik cloth from another shop , probably a present for his wife , and stuck to the parcel were two receiptsfor the cloth , but giving different prices , the lower faked price to fool the customs official in Hong Kong and avoid a few dollars ' import duty . At the bottom of the case was a detective novel with a grisly title that described Leigh 's own death , an eerie coincidence italicizing the improbable fraud of one , the pitiful condition of the other . He was in the morgue drawer , and here was his poor bundle of effects : this was all . I dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The suitcase caught my eye ; I opened it again and sorted through it quickly , lifting everything out a second time and shaking the clothes . There was no money in it ! I had told the desk clerk at the Strand he was dead , but only later picked up the suitcase . After I had left with the passportthey had gone up to his room and robbed him . The phone crackled ; Hing fretted beside me ; Gopi watched . I said , " Listen carefully . Yesterday I was with yourp67husband at the Botanical Gardens . Wait a minute  --  listen . It was a beautiful day  --  " It was a suffocating day , producing the feverish symptoms of a fatal illness in me . I had picked up my car at the garage , we had all met at the mortuary , and we followed behind the hearse  --  polished and sculpted like an old piano  --  attemptingfunereal solemnity by keeping our faded elderly cars in file , my chugging Renault , Yardley 's blue Anglia , Hing 's Riley ( he sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Mr. Tan and Wallace Thumboo in an old Ford Consul , Yates in his boxy Austin , and the others trailing , impossible to see in my rear-view mirror . We hit every red light , getting hotter and sicker at each stop , and we lost the hearse ( I could see Yardley irritably pounding his palm against the steering wheel ) at one junction when it speeded up and ran on the yellow . Gladys was with me . I had guessed in advance that only men would be there , and that did n't seem right . Also , I had to drop her off at a hotel immediately afterward , an appointmentof long standing I had only noticed that morning in my desk diary . Gladys was fanning herself absent-mindedly as I drove , and quickly against her chin at stoplights , making that fluttering I dreaded , the papery burr of beating cockroach wings . I told her to knock it off . That and the heat oppressedme . We were not in sunlight , but sweating in the mid-morning Singapore veil of dim steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing on the ground solid . There was nothing worse , I was thinking , than a cremationon a hot day in the tropics . It had all the inappropriatenessof a man puffing on a pipe in a burning house . I vowed that I would spare myself that fate . The crematorium off Upper Aljunied Road was a yellow building , with a chimney instead of a steeple , on a low hill , in a treeless Chinese cemetery , a rocky weedy meadow ofp68narrow plots , stone posts as grave markers , figured like milestonesturned on a lathe , an occasional angel , and worn cementvaults with peeling red doors , set in scorched hillocks : a whole suburb of trolls ' huts , clustered there in the kind of chaotic profusion that matched their lives , sleeping families on shophouse floors , and now , head to toe , beneath those posts and stones . Here and there was a high vault with a roof , fenced in from the others , the graveyard equivalent of a towkay 's mansion , which might almost have borne a nameplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this was hazy in the steamy air and when I looked back , obscured by the dust cloud our procession of cars was raising on the road that wound up to the crematorium . The chimney was not smoking . Some distance away , in the middle of the cemetery , a ghostly white-shirted party with umbrellas open stood slightly bowed before a vault mound . They could have been praying , but they were n't . Stooping reverentially , they began to let off firecrackers . " Ca n't they stop those little bastards ? " said Yardley , rushingup to me after we parked . Our dust cloud descended , sifting down on us . He looked at Gladys and suppressed another curse . " We ca n't have that nonsense going on duringthe service . " The Chinese mourners were lighting packets of fifty with the fuses knotted . The noise carried in steady burps ; there were flashes and delayed bangs . " Bloody  --  " Yardley turned and stalked away growling . " To amaze the gods , " Gladys said . " Very lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . " The other fellers came over to us . " Are you okay , Jack ? " asked Coony . " I hope it does n't rain , " said Smale , leaning back and squinting at the sky . We looked at him . " It 'd ruin it , " he said nervously . " Would n't it ? " Was hep69thinking of the fire that could be doused , or was it that fear of excessive gloom that fellers associate with rain at funer-als ? " It wo n't rain until October , " said Yates . The two Hings were in white , their terrifying color of mourning , white cotton suits and straw hats , carrying umbrellas , looking wretched . Mr. Tan wore a black tie . Becauseof the appointment , Gladys wore a bright green dress and carried a large handbag ; her face was a white mask with wizard 's eyes . Big Hing cracked his umbrella open , shook it , and walked in oversized shoes toward the building , holding the umbrella upright , but bouncing it as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked the hearse driver what we were supposed to do . He said four of us were to carry the coffin into the chapel ; the priest would take care of the rest . I objected to the word " priest " to describe an effeminate Anglican cleric of perhapsthirty , blushing in the heat , his cheeks pink , and wringinghis hands by the crematorium door ; in his white smocklikesurplice he eyed Gladys disapprovingly , like a spinsterishintern about to check her for the clap . I beckoned to Yardley and the others and said , " Look alive . " I had known most of them for fourteen years ; I had drunk with them nearly every night at the Bandung . Only that . I had never seen them all together , assembled in daylight away from the Bandung . So I was seeing them for the first time . They were strangers who knew me . The bad light of the Bandung had been kind to Yardley 's liverish pallor , a tropicalsallowness in an unlined face ; Frogget looked bigger and hairier , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his glasses had slipped down his nose from his perspiring ; Smale 's hair was reddish  --  I had always thought of it as brown ; Coony 's hair was combed straight back , the shape of his head , and his lower lip , which always protruded when his mouth was shut , was dry for once . None of them wasp70standing straight ; they were self-conscious in their suits , in unfamiliar postures , and Yardley 's leaning  --  one shoulder higher than the other  --  made him appear unwell . It might have been the old-fashioned rumpled suits I had never seen them wear , dark gray or black , wrinkled , smellingof moth balls and spotted with mildew like soup stains : an old ill-fitting suit makes the wearer seem shy . The wrinkleswere not in the usual places , the consequence of sitting or reaching , but were in unlikely places , across the chest of the jacket , pinches on the back and sleeves , drawer folds , 11 creases from storage , the cuffs bunched up ; the trousers were more faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suits reminded me of somethingYates had once whispered at the Bandung . " Tell me , Jack , " he said , " do n't we look like the legion of the lost ? " It seemed disrespectful to smoke near the crematorium , so we were all more edgy than usual . The hearse driver and his assistant slid the coffin out and Yardley , Frogget , Smale , and myself carried it across the dusty compound to the entrancewhere the rest stood behind the cleric . I thought I heard Yardley mutter , " He 's damned heavy , " but he might have said , " It 's damned heavy . " It was . I was afraid we might drop it . The others had been up drinking the night before and I had not been able to sleep . I knew they were worried about dropping it too , because they were carrying it much too fast . " Wally , " I said . Wally stood blocking the door , looking inside , with his back to us . " Wally ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was turned away . My hands were growing moist and slippingon the chrome fixture I was holding , and I snapped , " Move it or lose it ! " He jumped out of the way , and we proceeded inside and unsteadily down the aisle , panting , the six busy overheadp71fans in the room of folding chairs mocking our forced solemnitywith practical whirrs . We placed the coffin on a high wheeled frame at the front of the room and took our seats with the others . After a few moments Yardley leaned over and asked , " What 's the drill ? " I shrugged . It was my first cremation , and in that bare room of steel chairs , the only ornaments the photographs of the President and his wife , I could not imagine what was going to happen . We sat expectantly , the chairs squeaking and clanking . Hing loudly cleared his throat , so loud it made me want to spit , and as one person 's hacking inspires another 's , particularly in a still room , soon Smale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outside , the pooppoopof firecrackers continued ; and beside me Gladys began beating her fan , scraping it against her chin . The cleric walked up the aisle , his starched surplice rustling . The coughing stopped ; now there were only the fans , the chair squeaks , and the distant firecrackers . " Fellow brethren , " he said , looking at us with uncertainty and distaste ; he clung to his Bible , holding it chest high , and nodded at everyone individually with his pink flushed face  --  making suspense . He took a breath and began . His sermonwas the usual one , but he was young enough and had delivered it few enough times to make it sound as if he believed it : life was short and difficult , a testing time loaded with temptations ; and he pictured God as the all-seeing bumptious neighbor , rocking irritably on his celestial porch and passing judgment . He talked about our weaknesses and then concentrated on Leigh 's soul , which he addressed with great familiarity . The worst religions , I was thinking , rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in the same sinking boat ; harping on your sameness and denyingyou fancies and flesh and blood and visible hope , they reduce you to moaning galley slaves , manacled to a bloodyp72oar , puking in a sunless passage and pulling blindly toward an undescribed destination ; and constantly warning you that you might never arrive . " Believe in God , " the cleric was saying , and I thought , Yes , that 's easy , but does God believe in me ? I liked my religion to be a private affair ashore , a fire by a stone , a smoky offering ; one necessary at night , the light giving the heavens fraternal features to surprise me with the thrill of agreeable company . It was to make the authority of ghosts vanish by making holiness a friendly human act and defining virtue as joy and grace as permission granted. "  --  to judgment , " the cleric was saying , and as he spoke he jerked around several times to nod at Leigh 's coffin , as if Leigh was listening as long as his corpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paradise . " We are all of us sinners , wallowing in the flesh , " the cleric said . Gladys stopped fanning herself . She sniffed and began to cry ; and I hoped she was not planning to repent and back out of the appointment at the Palm Grove . She was the only person weeping ; the Hings were impassive and pale , Mr. Tan and Wally limply crestfallen ; Yardley and the others were sweating , but the sweat ran like tears and wet their faces and was almost like grief . My face was streaming , too , but I was n't crying ; my thoughts were too confused for that . Leigh , alive , had reminded me of myself , and his death warned me about my own  --  a warning so strong it made me ignore his death for part of the time . But I was also thinking : Now he ca n't tell anyone about my plans , my silk pajamas and cigars ; and I felt childish relief mingled with adult sadness that he was out of the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship ceases to vibrate and it makes a silence so sudden after three weeks of continual noise that you think your heart has stopped and you wonder for seconds if you 're dead . After those seconds you understand mortality , andp73the silence that terrified you is a comfort . Leigh 's death affectedme that way , and at the cremation I felt peaceful . It seemed better that he was going to be reduced to ashes  --  a corpse made small and poured into a little pot was not a corpse ; it was so tiny and altered you could n't reasonably weep over it . Cremation simulated disappearance ; it really was like flight , a movement I knew well . Bodies decaying underground made people cry , but a dozen pots on a shelf , a bottled family , were uncharacteristic relics of the forgettabledead , who might have simply skipped off and left their urns behind , one apiece . Burning , as the cleric hinted  --  and here I agreed  --  was like deliverance ; it was only bad on a hot day . My thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a clatter at the door ; a scrape ; a shufflethump , shuffle-thump . The cleric stared . We all turned . Gopi was cycling in , his shoulders heaving , making his sleeves flap . His eyes were big from the physical effort of his pedaling , and his shirt was stuck in a dark patch to his back . He took a seat at the front , alone , and he watched the coffin as if it was a magician 's box . The cleric , who might have thought Gopi was going to interruptwith Hindu wailing , quietly resumed , " Let us pray . " We knelt on the stone floor . Gopi had to look back to see how it was done . I was anxious for him , balanced on that wobbly knee ; he managed by steadying himself on the chair next to him . A sound of enormous wheezing filled the room as we stood ; it was not ours . A clapped-out harmonium had begun asthmaticallyto breathe " Jerusalem " at the back of the room . Yardley and the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did so with the hoarse gusto they gave the obscene songs Frogget started at the Bandung on Saturday nights . Frogget had a fine voice , higher than one would have expected from a feller his size and ( Gopi and Gladys were bothp74weeping for Leigh  --  why ? ) all the voices rang in the room , echoing on the yellow walls and drowning the fans , the firecrackers , and even the woofing harmonium with the hymn . And did those feet in ancient timeWalk upon England 's mountains green ? We gave the lines in the last part  --  Bring me my bow of burning gold , Bring me my arrows of desire  --  the sahib 's emphasis , trilling the r in the command resolutely . The cleric walked over to the coffin and sprinkled it and prayed out loud . I started thinking of the man out back , stoking the fire like a fry cook in clogs , stirring the coals in a black kitchen , sweating worse than we were and wiping his face on his shoulder , banging his poker on the furnace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What burial customs . It was over . The cleric flung his arms into the sign of the cross , a novice 's flourish of sleeves , and blessed us and said , " Amen . " The coffin was rolled out of the room through a rear door and we all went out to our cars . " You ready ? " I asked Gladys . Her tears had dried . She looked at me . " This short time or all day ? " Before I could answer Yardley was beside me asking , " You coming along ? We 're going for a drink . The day 's a dead loss  --  no sense going to work . " " I 'll be there in a little while , " I said , and seeing Fling leaving , smiled and waved him off . Hing 's face was tight ; he was unused to the lecturing at Christian services and might have expected the brass band , the busloads of relatives , the banners and pennants and cherry bombs that saw a Chinese corpse to the grave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am dropping ? " I did not reply . Yardley and Frogget faced the sky behind me . I turned to look . Smoke had started from the chimney , a black puff and ripples of stringy heat , then a gray columnp75unimpeded by any breeze shooting straight up and enlarging , becoming the steamy air that hung over the island . Despair is simple : fear without a voice , a sinking and a screamless fright . We watched in silence , all of us . Coony ground his cigarette out and gaped ; then , conscious that we were all watching the smoke , we looked away . " Who 's paying for this ? " Yardley asked . " I am , " I said , and felt sad . But when I got into the little car with Gladys and started away , throwing the shift into second gear , I felt only relief , a springy lightness of acquittal that was like youth . I was allowed all my secrets again , and could keep them if I watched my step . It was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p79FOR  AS LONG as I could remember I had wanted to be rich , and famous if possible , and to live to the age of ninety-five ; to eat huge meals and sleep late out of sheer sluttishness in a big soft bed ; to take up an expensive but not strenuous sport , golf or deep-sea fishing in a fedora with a muscular and knowledgeable crew ; to gamble with conviction instead of bitterness and haste ; to have a pair of girl friends who wanted me for my money  --  the security was appealing : why would they ever leave me ? All this and a town house , an island villa , a light plane , a fancy car , a humidor full of fat fragrant cigars  --  you name it . I guessed it would come to me late : fifty-three is a convenient age for a tycoon ; the middle-agedman turning cautious and wolflike knows the score , and if he has been around a bit he can take the gaff . It did not occur to me that it might never happen . Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune , a fine conscious postponement , made the romance , for to happen best it would have to come all at once , as a surprise , with the great thud a bag of gold makes when it 's plopped on a table , or with the tumbling unexpectedness ofp80thick doubloons spilling from the seams of an old wall you 're tearing apart for the price of the used wood . One rather fanciful idea I 'd had of success was that somehow through a fortuitous mix-up I would be mistaken for a person who resembled me and rewarded with a knighthood or a countryestate ; it was as good as admitting I did not deserve it , but that it was far-fetched made my receptive heart anticipateit as a possibility . It might , I thought , be a telephone call on a gray morning when , fearing bad news , I would hear a confident educated voice at the other end say , " Brace yourself , Mr. Flowers , I 've got some wonderful news  --  " Wonderful news in another fantasy was a letter . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 8-A bus out of Moulmein Green in the morning , or killing time in a hotel lobby when a girl was finishing a stunt upstairs , or dealing out the porno decks , or standing on the Esplanade and staring at the ships in the harbor . One started like this : Dear Mr. Flowers , It gives me great pleasure to be writing to you today , and I know my news will please you as much .. . Another was more direct : Dear Flowers , I 've had my eye on you for a long time , and I 'm very happy to inform you of my decision concerning your future .. . Another : Dear Jack , I am asking my lawyer to read you this letter after my death . You have been an excellent and loyal friend , the very best one could hope for . I have noted you in my will for a substantial portion of my estate as a token thanks for your good humor , charity , and humanity . You will never again have to think of ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singled out by our Foundation to be the recipient of a large cash disbursement . You will see from the enclosed form that no strings whatever are attached .. . Another : Dear Mr. Flowers , The Academy has entrusted to me the joyful task of informingyou of your election . This carries with it as you know the annual stipend of .. . There were more ; I composed as many as thirty in an afternoon , though usually I stuck to one and phrased it to perfection , working on it and reciting every altered declaration of the glorious news . The last was long and rambling ; it was only incidentally about money , and it began , My darling . . . No man of fifty-three wants to look any more ridiculous than his uncertain age has already made him , and I am well aware that in disclosing this fantastic game I played with myself , the sentences above , which prior to a few moments ago had never been written anywhere but in my head , much less typed under the embossed letterheads I imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Moulmein Green  --  I am well aware that in putting those eager ( " Brace yourself " ) openings in black and white I seem to be practicing satire or self-mockery . The difficulty is that unchallenged , squatting like trepanned demons in the padded privacy of an idle mind , one 's lunatic thoughts seem tame and reasonable , while spoken aloud in broad daylight to a stranger or written before one 's own eyes they are the extravagant ravings of a crackpot . You know what I want ? I said to Leigh , and told him , and was made a fool by his look of shock ; I should have kept my mouth shut , but how was I to know that he was not the stranger who would say ,  | " I 've got some good news for you , Flowers . " He might have thought I was mad . Madness is not believing quietly that you 're Napoleon ; it is demonstrating it , slipping your hand inside your jacket and striking a military pose . He might have thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I used to stand in Singapore doorways and hiss , " Hey bud " at passers-by . Crude I may have been , but mad never ; and I would like to emphasize my sanity by stating that even though I dreamed of getting one of those letters ( It gives me great pleasure . . . ) I could not understand how I would ever receive one , for I imagined thousands , paragraph by glorious paragraph , but I never mentally signed them , and none , not even the one beginning My darling , bore a signature . Who was supposed to be writing me those letters ? I had n't the faintest idea . The letters were fantasy , but the impulse was real : a viscerallonging for success , comfort , renown , the gift that could be handled , tangible grace . That momentary daydream which flits into every reflective man 's mind and makes him say his name with a title , Sir or President or His Highness  --  everyone does it sometimes : the clerk wants a kingship , it 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waking moment . I was n't kidding ; even the most rational soul has at least one moment of pleasurable reflection when he hears a small voice addressing him as Your Radiance . I had a litany which began Sir Jack , President Flowers , King John , and so forth . And why stop at king ? Saint Jack ! It was my yearning , though success is nasty and spoils you , the successfulsay , and only failures listen , who know nastiness withoutthe winch of money . If the rich were correct , I reasoned , what choice had they made ? Really , was disappointment virtueand comfort vice and poverty like the medicine that was good because it stung ? The President of the United States , in a sense the king of the world , said he had the loneliest job on earth ; where did that leave a feller like me ?  |p83The  theatrically convulsed agony of the successful is the failure 's single comfort . " Look how similar we are , " both will exclaim : " We 're each lonely ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So strictly off my own bat I gave myself a chance to choose  --  I would take the tycoon 's agony and forego the salesman 's . I said I wanted to be rich , famous if possible , drink myself silly and sleep till noon . I might have put it more tactfully : I wanted the wealth to make a free choice . I was not pleading to be irresponsible ; if I was rich and vicious I would have to accept blame . The poor were blameless ; they could not help it , and if they were middleagedthey were doubly poor , for no one could see their aches and no one knew that the middle-aged man at that corner table , purple with indigestion , thought he was having a heart seizure . That man will not look back to reflect unless he has had a terrible fright that twists his head around . Characteristically , he will look back once , see nothing , and never look back again . But Leigh and his hopeless last words gave me such an awful shock that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long look back  --  with the recent memory of imagining what my own last words might be , Is this all ? mumbled in a hot room  --  and thought of nothing but what had brought me to Singapore , and the sinking ships I had boarded since then . It was a bumboat . I jumped off the Allegro and there I was , sitting at the stern of a chugging bumboat , making my way toward Collyer Quay . It might have been cowardice ; in me , cowardice often looked like courage by worrying me into some panicky act . I ran , and it looked like pursuit ; but it was n't that  --  it was flight . The burnboat touched the quay . The Chinese pilot pressed a finger in salute to the hanky that was knotted around his head like a tea cosy . Having learned the trick of survival and reached a ripe old age , most fellers can look back on their lives and explain the logic of everything they 've done , show you the pattern ofp84their movements , their circlings toward what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can point without regret to the blunt old-type exclamation marks of their footprints , like frozen ones in snow , and make sense of them . If the footprints are a jumble and some face in retreat the feller might say with a wild accompanying cackle that he had his shoes on backward and appeared to be walking away as he advanced . The explanation is irrefutable , for old age itself is a kind of arrival , but I could not say  --  being fifty-three in Singapore  --  that I had arrived anywhere . I was pausing , I thought , and there was no good reason for any of my movementsexcept the truthful excuse that at the time of acting I saw no other choice . The absence of plot or design inspired my forlorn dream that magically by letter I would become a millionaire . My life was a pause ; I lived in expectation of an angel . My vision was explicit , and no guilt hampered it ; I wished away the ego of my past  --  I would not be burdened by my history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be one of those travelers who , unnerved by the unconscious boldness of their distance  --  the flight that took them too far  --  believe themselves to be off course and head for anything that resembles a familiar landmark . Only , up close , they discover it to be a common feature of a foreign landscape on which identical landmarks lie in all directions . They chase these signs , their panic giving the wheeling chase some drama , and very soon they are nowhere , travelers who never arrive , who do not die but are lost and never found , like those unfortunate Arctic explorers , or really any single middle-agedfeller who dies in a tropical alien place , alone and among strangers who mock what they ca n't comprehend , the hopeful man with the perfect dream of magic , burned to ashes one hot day and negligently buried , who was lost long before he died.  |p85THE  BUMBOAT touched the quay . I vaulted to the stone steps and almost immediately , in a small but ingenious way , became a hustler . The word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aspect of a business I understood well , for over the previous eleven months , soothed by Mothersill 's Pills , I had been crossing and recrossing the Indian Ocean in the Allegro , and at every port , from Mombasa to Penang , I had been appointed by the captain to perform a specific job for extra pay ; that is , to take on supplies by contacting the ship chandler . I enjoyed doing this ; it gained me admittance to a friendly family ashore , Ismailis in Mombasa , Portuguese in Beira , an Indo-French one in Port Louis , Parsees in Bombay . It was an entry into a world as mysterious for the sailor as the sea is for the landsman , the domestic life , drama in dry rooms that lay beyond the single street of seamen 's bars , the frontier that barricades harbors from their cities . At each port the ship chandler was our grocer , butcher , dhobi , fishmonger , hardware man ; he would supply anything at short notice , but I believe that at Hing 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for introducing a newp86wrinkle to one of the world 's most versatile professions . Later it was taken up by other ship chandlers and Singapore became a port in which even a large vessel could make a turnaroundin six hours without the crew mutinying . I look back and see a wild August storm , known in Singaporeas a Sumatra : a high wind blows suddenly from the west and the sky gathers into unaccountable blackness , a low heavy ceiling , night at noon , the cold rain sheeting horizontallyinto the surf . That day I was standing in the wheel house of a rocking launch . It was warm and sunny when we left the quay , but fifteen minutes out the sky darkened , the cabin door banged , and rain began hitting the glass with a sound like sleet ; we bolted the doors and breathed the enginefumes . Stonelike waves , each dark one with streaming ribbons of oil on its bumpy edges and topped with a torn cap of lacy froth , slammed into the starboard side of the launch , making the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto a canvas strap and wiping the steam off the back windowput my nose to the moaning glass . We were towing a forty-foot lighter , the sort used for transportingbales of raw rubber ; Chinese decorations were painted on the bow , evil white and black eyes , green whiskers , and a red dragon-fang mouth . The painted face with its scabrous complexion of barnacles rose and fell , gulping ocean , and the canvas cover , a vast pup tent pitched over the lighter , was being lashed by the wind ; our towrope , now loose as the lighter leaped at us , now tight as it plunged and dragged , was periodically wrung of water , which shot out in a twist of bubbly spray as it stretched tight . A grommet on the corner of the canvas tarp tore free , and the tent fly burst open , unveiling our cargo , twenty-three smartly dressed Chineseand Malay girls , their scared white faces almost luminousin the gloom of the quaking shelter ; they were huddledon crates and kegs , their knees together , holding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fog and rain and steamed-up windows , was very poor , and I had the impression we were thrashing in the open ocean , for no ships and not even the harborside could be made out . It was just after tiffin ; no wharf lights were on . It was fearfully dark and cold , and I was dizzy from the cabin fumes . We might have been in the South China Sea . " More to port , " I shouted to Mr. Khoo , showing him a circleI had drawn on the Western Roads of my harbor chart . " No , " he said , and spun the wheel starboard . " Do n't give me that ! " I said , and went for him . The launch bucked and threw me to the floor . I could feel the launch turning , slowed by the weight of the lighter , and just under the whistling wind the screams of my girls . Mr. Khoo was taking us back . I had seen seamen fight below decks during storms on the Allegro ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest and hide near the bridge , like a child in a slum runningfrom his quarreling parents . My fear was of seeing peopleenclosed by a larger struggle swept away and dying in a hammer lock . The storms encouraged fighting , and the fightingseemed to intensify the storm . " Give me the wheel like a good feller , " I said to Mr. Khoo . Mr. Khoo threatened me with a sharp elbow and held tight to the wheel . The wipers were paralyzed on the window ; I swayed and tried to see . " Do you know what this is costing me ! " I shouted . " Can not , " said Mr. Khoo , refusing to look at me . " Drop the anchor , then , " I said . " I 'll do it . " I unbolted the door and stepped into the wind . Up ahead , the rusty brown silo of a ship 's stern loomed , a light flashed , and I made out the name , Richard Everett , Liverpool . " Oh boy , there she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was crouched at the wheel . He looked up at the freighter , twisting his head . Ip88stayed on deck , waving to faces framed by yellow bonnets . It was too rough to use the ladder ; some men in slickers and boots were pushing a cargo net over the side . The launch still pitched . Mr. Khoo worked the lighter close by circling the launch around and nudging it against the side of the Richard Everett , and I had the satisfaction in a storm during which other lightermen waited at the river mouth by Cavanagh Bridge , of seeing my girls hoisted up , three at a time in the hefty cargo net , all of them soaked to the skin , fumbling with collapsed umbrellas and shrieking at the gale . The crane swung them on board and lowered them into the hold . There was a cheer , audible over the storm and wind , as the cargo net descended . I went up myself with the last load of girls and to the sound of steel doors slamming in the passageway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen hands of gin rummy ; the light softened in the porthole and then the sun came out . He paid me fifteen dollars a girl . He had asked for them on consignment , but I insisted on a flat rate . Two hours later , in sparkling sunshine , we were on our way . I rode in the lighter with the girls . We took down the canvas roof and May played a transistor radio one of the seamen had given her . Some of the girls put up their umbrellas , and they all sat as prim as schoolteachers on a Sunday outing . Junie wore a sailor hat . We cruised slowly back , enjoying the warmth and the light breeze , and docked at Pasir Panjangbehind a palm grove  --  I could not risk arriving at CollyerQuay or Jardine Steps with that cargo . It was not my first excursion . I had been doing it for severalmonths , usually small loads . Sometimes only two in a sampan rowed out from Collyer Quay to an old tanker , the girls disguised as scrubwomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundles of old rags , to fool the harbor police . I had always made it a practice  --  I was the first in Singapore , perhaps anywhere , to do so  --  to have a girl along with mep89when I delivered groceries and fresh meat and coils of rope , just in case . The girl was always welcome , and came back exhausted . The storm made me ; it became known that I was the enterprisingswineherd who took a lighterful of girls out at the height of a Sumatra that swamped a dinghy of Danish seamenthat same day . A week later a crewman on the Miranda buttonholed me : " You the bloke that floated them pros out to the Everett ? " I told him I was , and stuck out my hand . " Jack Flowers , " I said . " Call me Jack . Anything I can do for you ? " " You 're a lad , you are , " he said admiringly , and then over his shoulder , " ' ey , Scrumpy , it 's ' im ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out my pencil and clownishly licked the lead , and winked , saying , " Well , gentlemen , let 's see what we can scare up for you today . . . " The Sumatra had come sudden as a bomb , darkly filling the sky , outraging the sea , pimpling it with rain like lead shot , wrinkling it and snarling it into spiky heaves . I never let on that it hit us when we were halfway to the Richard Everett or that I had put my last dollar into releasing those girls and hiring the launch and lighter , and that to have turned back  --  no less perilous than going forward  --  would have disgraced me and ruined me irrecoverably . If we had sunk it would have been the end , for none of the twentythreegirls knew how to swim . I had not known the extent of the risk , but it was a venture  --  probably cowardly : I was afraid to lose my money and scared to turn back  --  that had tremendous consequences . The mates on the Miranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me commissions . And Fling 's business boomed . I had known Hing long before I jumped ship . The Allegro was registered in Panama , but her home port was Hong Kong . We were often in Singapore , and the only occasion in eleven months we left the Indian Ocean was to take a cargo of rub/ber to Vancouver . I thought of jumping ship there , and nearly did it , except that beyond Vancouver and the cold wastes of Canadian America I saw the United States , and that was the place I was fleeing . Hing was the first person I thought of when I developed my plan for leaving the Allegro . At the time he seemed the kindest man . I always looked forward to our stops in Singapore , and Hing was glad of our business . Just a small-time provisioner , delivering corn flakes to housewives at the Britishbases and glad for the unexpected order of an extra pound of sausages , he worked out of his little shop on Beach Road ; Gopi packed the cardboard cartons , and Little Hing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not dealing with Hing then . Our ship chandler was a large firm , also on Beach Road , just down from Raffles Hotel . One day , checkingover our crates of supplies , I saw some secondhand valves wrapped in newspaper that I felt were being palmed off on me . " We did n't order these , " I said . The clerk took them out of the crate . He dropped them on the floor . " Where are the ones we ordered ? " The clerk said nothing . The Chinese mouth is naturally grim ; his was drawn down , his nether lip pouted ; his head , too large for the rest of his body , had corners , and looked just like a skull , not a head fleshed out with an expression , but in contour and lightness , the sutures and jaw hinges visible , a bone with a flat skeletal crown . This feller 's head , ridiculouslymounted on a scrawny neck , infuriated me . " Where , " I repeated , " are the ones we ordered ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion . " Out of stock . " " I thought as much . So you gave us these . You 're always doing that ! " I almost blew a gasket . " We 're going to be at sea for the next ten days . What if a valve goes ? They aren'tp91going to be any good to us , are they ? " I wanted him to reply . " Are they ? " Anger takes some responsive cooperation to fan blustering to rage . He would not play ; the Chinese seldom did . Some fellers accused the Chinese of harboring a motiveless evil , but it was not so . Their blank look was disturbing because it did nothing to discourage the feeling that they meant us harm . The blankness was blankness , a facial void reflecting a mental one : confusion . If I had to name the look I would call it fear , the kind that can make the Chinese cower or be wild . The clerk cowered , withdrawing behind the counter . I kicked the crate and stamped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway of his shop . I was immediatelywell disposed to him ; he was reliably fat and calm , and he had the prosperous , satisfying bulk , the easy grace of a trader with many employees . " Yes ? " Apart from a few wooden stools , a calendar , an abacus , bills withering on a spike , and on the wall a red altar with a pot full of smoldering joss sticks , the shop was empty of merchandise . Little Hing was carrying groceries from the back room , Gopi was ramming them into a crate . " I need some valves , " I said . Then , " Got ? " He thought I was saying " bulbs , " but we got that straight , and finally , after I described the size , he said , " Can get . " " When ? " " Now , " he said , calling Little over . " You want tea ? Cigarette ? Here  --  " He shook a cigarette out of a can . " Plenty for you . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had the valves for me in twenty minutes , and that was how we started doing business with fling . The next time the Allegro called at Singapore , Hing had put up his ship chandler 's sign . There was nothing he could not get ; he had a genius for winkling out the scarcest supplies , confirming the claim he printed on his stationery , Provisions of Every De/scription Shall Be Supplied at Shortest Notice . And every time I called on him with my shopping list he took me out to dinner , a roast beef and Yorkshire pudding feed at the Elizabethan Grill , or a twelve-course Chinese dinner with everything but bears ' paws and fish lips on the table . It was simple business courtesy , the ritual meal . I was buying a thousand dollars ' worth of provisions and supplies from him ; for this he was paying for my dinner . I was an amateur . I thought I was doing very well , and always congratulated myself as , lamed by brandy , I staggered to the quay to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the businesslogic of " Have a cigar  --  take two , " when it was too late ; but as I say , I started out hissing , " Hey bud " from doorways along Robinson Road . I was old enough to know better . During one of the large meals , Hing , who in the Chinese style watched me closely and heaped my plate with food every five minutes , leaned over and said , " You . . . wucking . . . me . " His English failed him and he began gabbing in Cantonese . The waitress was boning an awed steamed garupa that was stranded on a platter of vegetables . She translated shyly , without looking up . " He say . . . he like you . He say . . . he want a young man . . . " " Ang moh , " I heard Hing say . " Redhead . " The waitress removed the elaborate comb of the fish 's spine and softened Hing 's slang to , " European man . . . do very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not speak awkward like Chinese people . And he say . . . " Hing implored with his eyes and his whole smooth face . I was thirty-nine . At thirty-nine you 're in your thirties ; at forty , or so I thought then , you 're in the shadow of middle age . It was as if he had whispered , " Brace yourself , Flowers . I 've had my eye on you for a long time . . . " I was excited . The Chinese life in Singapore was mainly noodles and children in a single room , the noise of washing and hoicking.  |p93It  could not have been duller , but because it was dull the Chinese had a gift for creating special occasions , a night out , a large banquet or festive gathering which sustained them through a year of yellow noodles . Hing communicated this festive singularity to me ; I believed my magic had worked , my luck had changed with my age ; not fortune , but the promiseof it was spoken . I saw myself speeding forward in a wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hing 's shop . He shook my hand , offered the can of cigarettes , and began clacking his lighter , saying , " Yes , Jack , yes . " Little Hing came over and asked for the shopping list , the manifests and indents . " No list , " I said , and grinned . " No ship , no list ! " I had turned away to explain . " From now on I 'm working for the towkay . " Behind me , Big Hing was screwing the lid back on to the can of cigarettes , and that was the only sound ; the tin lid caught and clicked and rasped in the metal grooves , and was finally silent . Big Hing was grave , reflectively biting his upper lip with his lower teeth . He banged the cigarette tin onto the trestle table , making the beads on the abacus spin and tick . He becamebrisk . He led me to my cubicle , two beaverboard partitions , without a ceiling , narrow as a urinal , and he shot the curtain along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the stool and put my head down . I did not turn around . I knew the Allegro had sailed without me.  |p94THE  SECOND TIME I met Hing , when I was still buying for the Allegro and thought of him as a friend , he took me to an opium parlor , a tiny smoke-smeared attic room off North Bridge Road . It was one of the stories I told later in hotel bars to loosen up nervous fellers whom I had spotted as possibleclients . I had expected the opium parlor to be something like a wang house filled with sleepy hookers relaxing on cushions ; I was not prepared for the ghostly sight of five elderly addicts , dozing hollow-eyed in droopy wrinkled pajamas , and two equally decrepit " cooks " scraping dottle out of black pipes . The room was dark ; a single shutter , halfopen , gave the only light ; the ceiling panels seemed kept in place by the cobwebs that were woven over the cracks between the panels and the beams they dangled from . The walls were marked with the cats ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture , broken crates and stools , and low cots and string beds with soiled pillows where the derelict men slept with their mouths open . A very old woman in wide silk trousers and red clogs drank coffee out of a condensed milk tin and watched me . It was anp95atmosphere only an opium trance could improve . I anxiously sucked one pipeful ; none of the skinny dreamers acknowledgedme , and we left . In front of the opium parlor , where Hing 's Riley sat , a parking attendant , a round-faced girl in a straw hat and gray jacket , was writing out a ticket . Hing saw the joke immediately , and we both laughed : the parking ticket at the opium den . I embellished it as a story by increasingthe overtime parking fine and glamorizing the dingy room , giving it silk pillows and the addicts youth . The opium parlor was Hing 's idea . He had convinced me that I could ask anything of him ; he said , " Singapore have everything , " and he wanted a chance to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I chose simple pleasures , outings , walks , the Police Band concerts at the Botanical Gardens , fishing from the pier . Hing made suggestions . He introduced me to Madam Lum and her chief attraction , Mona , a girl with the oddest tastes , whom I used to describe truthfully to fellers , saying , " She 's not fooling  --  she really likes her work , and everyone comes back singing her praises ! " Hing took me to the " Screw Inn , " a little bungalowof teen-age girls off Mountbatten Road , and he taught me that yellow-roofed taxis were the tip-off : more than two parked together in a residential area indicated a brothel close by . At Hing 's urging I had my first taste of the good life : a morning shave , flat on my back at the Indian barbershopon Orchard Road ( Chinese barbers used dull razors  --  the sparse Chinese beard was easy to scrape off ) ; a heavy lunch at the Great Shanghai , followed by a nap and a massage by a naked Chinese girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward invited another girl into the room so that the three of us could fool for the whole afternoon . After tea , both girls gave me a bath and we went for a stroll ; I walked them to a bar , had a last drink , then early to bed with a novel  --  the sequence of a lovely exhausting day , which gave me a stomach full of honey and the feeling that the skinp96I wore was brand new . Hing paid the bills . He had few pleasures himself , and he was n't a drinker . What he liked were big Australian girls in nightclubs who stripped to the buff and then got down on all fours and shook and howled like cats . He understood food ; he taught me the fine points of ordering Szechwan meals , the fried eels in sauce , the hotsoursoup , poached sea slugs , steamed pomfret , and crisp duck skin that was eaten in a soft bun . He gave me bottles of ginsengwine , which he claimed was an aphrodisiac tonic , and on the appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he was glad I was n't British , and why was n't I married , and how did I like Singapore ? All this time I was his customer ; the ritual friendship ended when I became his employee , and at 600 Straits dollars a month I was treated as a difficult burden , crowding his shop with my bulk , wasting his time , eating his money . He stopped speaking to me directly , and if the two of us were in the shop alone he assumed a preoccupied busy air , rattling scraps of paper , pretending to look for things , banging doors , groaning , saying his commercial rosary on his abacus . He spoke to me through his dog ; my mistakes and lapses got the dog a kick in the ribs . I thought I might be promoted , but I learned very early that no promotion would come my way . The job interested me enough so that I could do it without any encouragementfrom Hing . For Hing to thank me , somethinghe never did , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of face : civility was a form of weakness for him . I understood this and took his rudeness to be the gratitude it was . We had no contract ; after our verbal agreementHing arranged a visa for me which allowed me to stay in Singapore as long as I worked for him . This was convenient ( the bribe came out of his pocket ) , but limiting : if he fired me the visa would be canceled and I would be deported . He needed me too much to fire me , but I knew that to remindhim of this would be to ask for a sacking , for that was the only way he could demonstrate I was n't needed.  |p97But  I was . A year on the Allegro and all the calls we had made at Singapore had acquainted me with most of the other vessels and skippers who called regularly , and I knew many of the fellers in the Maritime Building who managed the shipping lines . The advantage I had , which Hing had hinted at , only dawned on me later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chandlers in Singapore were either Indian or Chinese . As a paleface in the late fifties in Singapore I drank in clubs and bars where " Asians , " as they were called , were not allowed . Largely , I drank in these places because I was not welcome in the Chinese clubs , and I did n't like the toddy in the Indian ones . It offended me that I was forced to drink with my own race  --  later , I would not do otherwise : I could n't relax with fellers of other races  --  but in the end , this simple fact of racial exclusiveness landed Hing with many contracts for supplying European ships . I was learningthe ropes : Chinese and Indians transacted all their business in offices , Europeans did it in clubs and used their offices as phone booths . A club , even a so-called exclusive one , was easy to enter but hard to join . The doormen were Malays or Sikhs , and I had learned how to say " How 's every little thing , brother ? " in Malay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dared to turn an ang moh away ; and as for signing the drink chits , I had a number of match tricks and brain twisters that I 'd spring on anyone drinking alone . The loser had to sign for the drink . I never lost . " Just in from Bangkok , " I 'd say . " Feller up there showed me a cute gimmick . You 've probably seen it . No ? Well , you put six matches down like this , make a little sort of circle with them . There . Now  --  I wonder if I 've got that right ? I 'm a real jerk when it comes to these tricky things . What you 're supposed to do is rearrange five matches without disturbing  --  " After I explained , I 'd say , " Loser signs , okay ? " and the drink would be as good as mine . That was a British con.  |p98Americans  were easier . " Bet you ca n't name the twelve apostles , " or " Whose picture 's on the hundred ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " secured my drinks with Americans , and with a drink in my hand I could stay in a club bar for hours , making up stories , chatting , or telling jokes that appealed to the listener 's prejudices by confirming them . There were not many Chinese jokes , apart from the funny names , of which I had a long list , culled from the Singapore telephone directory ( " Pass me the phone book , Ali ; my friend here does n't believe Fook Yew and Wun Fatt Joo really live in Singapore " ) . There were many good Indian jokes , and these always went down well . I told Englishmen the joke about the Texan who 's accused of sodomizing animals . " Cows , pigs , mules , " says his accuser , a girl he wants to take home . She goes on , " Sheep , dogs , cats , chickens  --  " The Texan interrupts in annoyance : " What do you mean , chickens ? " Americans were always bowled over by the story of the Englishman whose pecker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally decides to see a doctor , who says he knows how to sew the thing back on . " Just hand it over and I 'll see to it straightway . " The Englishman slaps his pockets , says , " I 've got the damned thing here somewhere , " and gives the doctor a huge cigar . " This is a cigar , " says the perplexed doctor , and " My word , " says the Englishman , " I must have smoked my cock ! " Sometimes I clowned around , like making a great show of ordering cherries in brandy , simply to say , " To tell the truth , I hate these cherries , but I like the spirit in which they 're given ! " So , even without the match tricks and brain twisters , someone was always buying me a drink and saying , " You 're a card . " And in clubs where I was not a member , fellers said , " We have n't seen you lately  --  missed you at the film show , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about time we tackled that gatecrashers ' clause " ; eventually , a fellerwould ask , " Say , Jack , what 's your line of work ? "  | " Me ? I 'm in ship chandling . " I never said I was a water clerk . " Odd , that , " would be the reply . " I know exactly what you mean , " I 'd say . " But the way I figure it , this business could use a little streamlining . Methodshave n't changed since Raffles 's time , and by God neither have some of the groceries they 're flogging , from the taste of them ! Shops have n't been swept in years , bread 's as hard as old Harry , weevils in the rice  --  mind you , I 've got nothingagainst our Asiatic brothers . It 's just as you say , they work like dogs . On the other hand , your Indian is never really happy handling meat  --  but you ca n't hold their religion against them , can you ? " " One ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And your Chinese ship chandler  --  he 'll give you a turd and tell you it 's an orchid . Shall I tell you what I saw one day in a Chinese shop ? This 'll kill you  --  " The feller would be agreeing with me and putting his oar in from time to time . I 'd tell my valve story and he 'd cap it with a better and terrifying one about defective life jackets or wormy provisions , all the while working up the indignationto change ship chandlers . My most effective selling ploy , which I used just before mealtimes , when conversations always got around to food , was my English breakfast . This never failed . The English , I had discovered , had a weakness for large breakfasts ; it might have had a literary source  --  a Dickens character havinga beefsteak with his tea  --  or a tradition begun on those cold mornings when the Thames used to freeze over , or war rationing . Whatever the reason , it was an inspired way of getting a contract . I hit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singapore , with a feller from the Victoria Shipping Lines . It was on the verandah of the Singapore Cricket Club , on a Saturday just before tiffin . The feller was sitting beside mep100in a wicker chair and we were watching some ladies bowling on the grass . This form of bowling was exactly like the Italian game bocce , which my father played in an alley in the North End every Sunday afternoon . It was the only game I knew well , and I was commenting on the ladies ' match to the felleron my right . " Got ta have more left-hand side . . . Not enough legs on that one . . . Kissed it . . . Never make it . . . She 's out for blood  --  it 's going like a demon  --  " The ladies took a rest . I turned to the feller and said , " Seems there was this Texan  --  " " Very amusing , " he said , when I finished , his **27;14839;TOOLONG the honking laughter he could n't suppress . " Have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm hungry , " he said . " No time for breakfast this morning . Ruins the day , do n't you find ? " " Absolutely , " I said . " That 's what I try to tell these skippersI deal with . Give a seaman a slap-up breakfast and he 'll do a fair day 's work . Cut down on his lunch , but do n't ever tamper with that breakfast of his ! " " My idea of a really topnotch breakfast is kippers , porridgeoats , eggs , and a pot of tea  --  hot and strong . " He smacked his lips . " You 're forgetting your fruit juice  --  juices are very important . And choice of cereals , some bubble and squeak , huge rashers of bacon , or maybe a beefsteak and chips , stack of toast , hot crumpets , marmalade . Boy ! " The feller was nodding in agreement and swallowing . " It 's a funny thing , you know , " I went on . " These ship chandlers do n't supply fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper and the fruit grows locally . They give you this tinned stuff . " " You can taste the metal . " " Sure you can ! " " Potatoes make a nice breakfast , " he said , still swallowing . " Hashbrowns  --  fry ' em up crisp and hot and serve them with gouts of H. P. Sauce . "  | " I 'm famished , " he said , and looked at his watch . " Me too , " I said . " I would n't mind a big English breakfastright this minute . I envy the seamen on some of the ships I supply . " " All the same , " he said , " it sounds an expensive meal . " " Not on your nelly , " I said , and quoted some prices , adding , " I buy in bulk , see , so I can pass the savings on to the customer . I still make a profit  --  everyone gains .

" I winked . " Think about it . We 'll see your men get a good breakfast . Oh , and if there 's anything else you require  --  anything at all  --  just give me a tinkle and I 'll see what I can scare up . Cheers . " He rang the next day . He offered me a chandling contractfor three freighters , a couple of tankers , and two steamshipsof modest tonnage that did the Singapore  --  North Borneorun . At the end of the conversation he hesitated briefly and murmured , " Yesterday , urn , you said anything , did n't you ?

She 's got , say , twentythreeable seamen , and  --  " " You 've come to the right man , " I said . " How about a coffee ? I 'll explain then . " " Lunch , " he insisted , pleased . " At the club . And thanks , thanks awfully . "  |p103AT  THAT PERIOD in my life , my first years in Singapore , I enjoyeda rare kind of happiness , like the accidental discovery of renewal , singing in my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true power : mercy and boldness . I felt brave . I did n't belittle it or try to justify it , and I never wondered about its queer origin . I was converted to buoyancy , and rising understood survival : the surprise of the marooned man who has built his first fire . I had turned forty without pain , and until Desmond Frogget came I was the youngest drinker in the Bandung . The Bandung was a lively place : freshly painted , always full , with free meat pies on Saturdays and curry tiffin on Sundays , and a Ping-Pong table which we hauled out to work up a thirst . A stubby feller named Ogham used to play the piano in the lounge , jazzy tunes until midnight and finishing up with vulgar and patriotic songs . I can see it now on a Saturdaynight , the room lit by paper lanterns rocked by the fans , Wally in a short white jacket and black tie shaking a gin sling , the main bar heaving with drinkers , all of them regulars , and me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-neck shirt that was my trademark , and Ogham in the lounge playing " Twelfth Street Rag . " Some feller would lean over and say to me , " Oggie could have been a professional , you know , but like he says , that 's no life for a man with a family . " Ogham pounded the piano at the Bandung and never introducedus to his family , and after he left Singapore there were various explanations of where he had gone . Some said to a London bank , but Yardley sneered , " He was a lush . He got the sack and three months ' gadji and now he 's in Surrey , mending bicycles . " For Yardley no fate was worse . With Ogham gone I hacked around sometimes with the Warsaw Concerto , hitting a sour note at the end of an expertly played passage to be funny , but some fellers said I was being disrespectfulto Ogham and I had to stop . Later , an old-timer wandering back through the lounge from the toilet in the kitchen would glance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder what happened to him . Christ , he could have turned professional . " " Oggie did n't know whether his arsehole was bored or punched , " Yardley would reply , believing Ogham to be a deserter . " He got the sack and three months ' gadji and now he 's in  --  " The day Ogham left he got very nostalgic about a particulartowpath he had played on as a child ; he bought us all a drink and reminisced . I had never seen him so happy . We listened at the bar as he took a box of matches and said , " The gasworks was over here , " and put a match down , " and the canal ran along what we used to call the cut  --  here . And  --  " The scene was repeated with the others , the memory of a picnic or tram ride re-enacted at the bar before their ships sailed . Many of the regulars at the Bandung started to leave . It was getting near to Independence , and over a drink , when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englandp105and not his house in Bukit Timah . So the Bandung emptied . On a side road at the city limit , it was too far off the beaten track for the average tourist to find it , and what tourists there were in those days came by ship . I spent most of my free time hustling in bars in the harbor area , places a tourist with a few hours ashore might wander into , or in the cut-price curio shops in Raffles Place . I had earned enough money in my first year to be considered a big spender in the Bandung , and to rent a large yellow house on River Valley Road , with three bedrooms and a verandah supported by solid white pillars , shaded by chicks the size of sails on a Chinese junk . As a bachelor I lived in one room and allowed the other rooms to fall into disuse . I had two gray parrots who pecked the spines off all my books , a dozen cats , and an old underemployed amah who played noisy games of mahjong with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning as they shuffled the mahjong tiles , a process they called " washingthe tiles . " The amah had made the bed and fixed breakfastenough times to know that I was not practicing celibacy , and she was continually saying that as a " black and white " she was trained to care for children , a hint that I should get married . She sized up the girls I took home and always said , " Too skinny ! You not like hayvie ! Yek-yek ! " I believed that I would marry a tall young Chinese girl , with a boy 's hips and long crow-black hair and a shining face ; and I 'd take her away , the hopeful mutual rescue that was the aim of every white bachelor then in the East . I did not give up the idea until later , when I saw one of these marriages , the radiant Chinese girl , shyly secretive , easily embarrassed , transformed into a crass suburban wife , nagging through her nose about prices in a monotonous voice , with thick unadventurous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boring and suburban , saying to exhausted listeners in perfect English , " Well , we Chinese  --  " I had the idea of marriage ; as long as I postponed the action , romance wasp106possible for me , and I was happy . Any day , I expected to get the letter beginning , " Dear Mr. Flowers , It gives me great pleasure to be writing to you today , and I know my news will please you  --  " Or perhaps the other one , starting , " My darling  --  " My brief , unrewarding enterprises , evenings calling out " Hey bud " to startled residents walking their dogs , afternoonssailing two fruit flies dressed as scrubwomen ( greasy overalls covering silk cheongsams ) to rusty freighters  --  these were over . The Richard Everett episode and the notoriety that followed it singled me out . Fellers rang me up at all hours of the night , asking me to get them a girl , and one of my replies  --  delivered at four in the morning to an importuningcaller who said he hoped he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " I had said , " I was up combing my hair . " In the harbor bars I was " Jack " to everyone , and I knew every confiding barman by name . What pleasure it gave me , knocking off early at Hing 's , to go home and put on my white shoes and a clean flowered shirt and then to make my rounds in a trishaw , a freshly lit cheroot in my teeth , droppingin on the girls , in bars or massage parlors , to see how many I could count on for the evening . The wiry trishaw driver pumped away ; I sat comfortably in the seat with my feet up as we wound through the traffic . The sun at five o'clock was dazzling , but the bars I entered were dark and cool as caves . I would stick my head in and say in a jaunty greeting to the darkness , " Hi girls ! " " Jaaaack ! " They would materialize out of booths , hobble over to me on high heels , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me genial tickling pinches in the crotch . " Come , Jack , I give you good time . " " Me , Jack , you like ? " " Touch me , baby . " " You 're all flawless , " I 'd say , and play a hand of cards , buy them all a drink , and move on to a new bar . Many of the girls were independent , not paying any secret society protectionp107money . I called them " floaters " because when they were n't floating around looking for a pickup I was literally floating them by the dozen out to ships in the harbor . A great number of them who hung around the bars on Anson Road  --  The Gold Anchor , Big South Sea , Captain 's Table , Champagne Club , Chang 's  --  came to depend on me for customers . They were using me in the same way as Hing , to get Europeans , who did n't haggle and who would pay a few dollars more . The Chinese were after the ang moh trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier . I could get white tourists and sailorsfor the girls as easily as I got the club members who were in the shipping business for Hing . The floaters along Anson Road and the Hing brothers were not the only ones who depended on me ; the British servicemen at Changi , the sailorsfrom H.M.S. Terror , the club members and tourists depended on me as well : the Chinese who sought the ang mohs were in turn being sought by the ang mohs , and both , ignorant of the others ' hunting , came to me for introductions  --  finding me they found each other . But the girls in the wharf-area bars forfeited all their Chinese trade when they were seen holding hands with a paleface . After that , they were tainted , and no Chinese would touch them or notice them except to bark a singular Cantonese or Hokkien obscenity , usually an exaggeration of my virility ( " So the redhead 's got a big doo-dah ! " ) , meant as a slur on the girls for being lustful , and on me for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most Chinese consider the size of the normal male organ . I was resented by most of the Chinese men in the bars ; they accused me , in the oblique way Hing had , of spoiling the girls . The occupation of a prostitute they saw as a customarytraditional role , an essential skill . But pairing up with red-haired devils made the girls vicious  --  it was an abnormality , something perverse , and the Chinese men consideredthese girls of mine as little better than the demon/women in folk stories who coupled with dogs and bore hairy babies . And that was not all . The men also had that littlecountrygrievance , a point of view Yardley and the old-timers shared , about rich foreigners butting in and sending the prices up . Neither accusation was justified : the girls ( who nearly always hated the men they slept with ) were improved by their contact with Europeans , quiet undemanding men , unlike their sadistic woman-hating counterparts in the States . The men were instructive , curious , and kind , and wanted little more than to sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chinese whore in Singapore . And as for the prices going up  --  after a decade of inflation , when the price of a haircut doubled , cigarettes increased five times , and some house rents  --  my own , for example  --  went up by 20o per cent , the price of a short time with massage stayed the same , and an all-nighter cost only an extra three-fifty . Until Japanesecameras flooded the market , a night in bed with one of my girls was the only bargain a feller could find in Singapore . The Chinese men would not listen to reason . " Boochakong just now cost twenty-over dollar-lah , " they complained . I felt loathed and large . Some simply did n't like my face or the fact that I was so pally with Chinese girls . I have already mentioned the secret-society member , the Three Dot in the Tai-Hwa who asked me threateningly , " Where you does wuck ? " Another brute , late one night , took a swing at me in the parking lot of the Prince 's Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlocking my car  --  Providence made him stumble ; and later the Prince 's manager , who to a Chinese eye might have looked like me  --  they ca n't tell ang mohs apart , they say , and do n't find it funny  --  was found in a back alley with his throat cut and his flowered shirt smeared with blood . Karim , the barman , said his eyes had been ritually gouged . I had to choose my bars carefully , and I made sure my trishaw driver was a big feller . Still , I was making money , and it delighted me on sunnyp109afternoons to have a cold shower , then make my rounds in a well-upholstered trishaw , chirping into dark interiors , " Hi girls ! " and to say to a stranger in a confident whisper , " If there 's anything you want  --  anything at all  --  " and be perfectlycertain I could supply whatever he named . Being American was part of my uniqueness . There were few Americans in Singapore , and though it was the last thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place for a good reason  --  the glad-hander , the ham with the loud jokes and big feet and flashy shirts , saying " It figures " and " Come off it " and " Who 's your friend ? " and " This I got ta see , " it was the only role open to me because it was the only one the people I dealt with accepted . It alerted them when I behaved untypically ; it looked as though I was concealing something and intended to defraud them by playing down the Yankee . In such a small place , an island with no natives , everyone a visitor , the foreigner made himself a resident by emphasizing his foreignness . Yardley , who was from Leeds , but had been in Singapore since the war  --  he married one of these sleek Chinese girls who turned into a suburban dragon named Mildred  --  had softened his Leeds accent by listening to the BBC Overseas Service . He put burnt matches back into the box ( muttering , " These are threppence in U.K. " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cup before the tea . The one time I made a reference to the photographin the Bandung of the Queen and Duke ( " Liz and Phil , I know them well  --  nice to see them around , broo-rehah ! " ) , Yardley called Eisenhower  --  President at the time  --  " A bald fucker , a stupid general , and half the time he does n't know whether he wants a shit or a haircut . " Consequently , but against my will , I was made an American , or rather " The Yank . " When America was mentioned , fellers said , " Ask Jack . " I exaggerated my accent and dropped my Allegro pretense of being Italian . I tried to give the impression of a cheerful rascal , someone gently ignorant ; I claimedp110I had no education and said , " If you say so " or " That 's really interesting " to anything remotely intelligent . It was awfully hard for me to be an American , but the hardest part was playing the dumb cluck for a feller whose11 intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoned they had great natural gifts ; Yates , in his own phrase " an avaricious reader , " would say , " I 'm reading Conrad " when he was stuck in the first chapter of a book he 'd never finish ; Yardley pointed to me one night and said , " I would n't touch an American book with a barge pole , " and Smale ended every argument with , " It all comes down to the same thing , then , do n't it ? " to which someone would add , " Right . Six of one and half a dozen of the other . " They were always arguing , each argument illustrated by anecdotes from personal experience . That was the problem : they saved up stories to tell people back home ; then , realizing with alarm that they probably were n't going home , wondered who to tell . They told each other . Stories were endlessly repeated , and not even the emphasis or phrases varied . The silent fellers in the Bandung were not listening ; they were waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine listener  --  the inexperienced American , there to be instructed . But the funny thing was , I had a college education and almost a degree . It was no help in the Bandung to say a bright truth , for even if someone heard it he was incapable of verifying it . And on the job it created misunderstandings . I recall meeting an Irish seaman on one of my " meat runs , " as my ferrying of girls into the harbor was called . Hearing his brogue I said , " I 'm crazy about Joyce , " and he replied , " That skinny one in the yellow dress ? " I said , " You guessed it ! " and he went over and pinched her sorry bottom through a fold in her frock . Later he thanked me for the tip-off . He was right and I was wrong : education is inappropriate to most jobs , and it was practically an impertinence to the enterprises of the feller whom an In/dian ship chandler on Market Street described as " having a finger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I was thirty-five , a freshman . I always seemed to be the wrong age for whatever I was doing , and because of that , paying dearly for it . But I was not alone . Older students were a common sight in every university in the late forties and fifties , army veterans from the Second World War and then Korea , wearing faded khaki jackets with the chevrons torn off , the stitch marks showing , and shoes with highly polished toes . My inglorious war  --  a puncturedeardrum put me behind a desk in Oklahoma  --  ended in 19455 . I came home expecting a miracle letter ( Dear Jack , It 's good to hear you 're home and I have some fabulous news for you . . . ) , but nothing happened . I helped my father in the tailor shop , blocking hats and putting tickets on the dry cleaning , and sometimes doing deliveries . My uncle said , " There 's good money in printing , " so I joined a linotype school , which I quit soon after . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A good short-order cook can name his salary " sent me in other directions . I was reading a great deal  --  the serious paperback was having its vogue in the early fifties ( they were thought to be somewhat salacious : " He 's just reading a paperback " was considered mockery )  --  and I was encouraged by the biographicalnotes , less frequent today , which listed the previous occupations of the author on the back cover . " Jim Sidebottomhas had a varied career , " they 'd begin , and go on to list twenty back-breaking jobs . I imagined my own biographical note : " After his discharge from the U.S. Army , where he reached the rank of corporal , John ( " Jack " ) Fiori worked as a hat blocker in his father 's tailor shop , and then in successionas a printer , draftsman , short-order cook , bartender , dishwasher , lifeguard , baker , and fruit seller . He has always considered fiction to be his chief aim , and has this to say aboutp112the present novel : I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a good biographical note , enhanced by an imagined photograph of me smoking a cigarette over a typewriter . I smoked . I bought a typewriter and learned to use it . I typed my biographical note . But that was all : there was no book . I had nothing to write . I knew nothing beyond my name and the face I practiced . I did n't understanddanger or regret ; a book was an extensive biographical note . Twenty years later William Leigh turned up and asked me urgent questions , and died with a foolish sentence on his lips . before I could reply ; and I burned him to dust . So this memoirwas provoked . Writing a book is a splendid idea , but it was not mine . My notion was simpler , just a picture of my experienced face and the list of jobs that made the face that way . This memoir is not the book or the work I imagined ; it was urged upon me , like a complicated , necessary enchantmentI did little to inspire , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboriously , to conjure : an imprecise trick , half accident , half design , begun as a deliberate memory ( " Mister Hing vaunting Mister Jack . . . " ) and completed by the kind of magic that to discover thoroughly is to fail at . I thought I could learn at college . It was my only reason for going . I found myself among a few earnest veterans and many fresh-faced kids . The older fellers never flunked out , but at the same time never excelled , resenting being lectured to and corrected by educated fellers the same age or younger , draft dodgers or fairies with leather elbow patches , whom they could only nag with the reply , " I 'll bet you do n't even know how to clean a gun ! " The ones on the GI Bill lived with their harassed wives and children in gray Nissen huts , referred to as " married quarters . " Most of the older fellers were economics majors or engineers ( the pocketful of pens , the slide rule in a scabbard ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in the college routine . Be/sides , they had problems at home , and so they treated their education as a job , being punctual and tidy , carrying creased lunch bags , and keeping regular hours . I saw them in the student union salting a hard-boiled egg and underlining a physics book . Some , of whom I was one because I was unmarried and majoring in English , were accommodated by the fringe people , the art majors , would-be poets , weekend winos , hangers-on , and hitchhikers . That was the enterprise then , saying , " Aw shit , I got ta bust out " and hitchhiking in sweat shirts across the country , aiming for California or Mexico , and staying drunk the whole way by gagging down whole bottles of Tokay or Muscatel . These fellers would show up with stories of their travels ( " I met this beautiful sad old man in Denver , and he says to me . . . " ) and some poems about America which they 'd shout , taking swigs out of a can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck hands on freighters , and going to sea was the height of their ambition . Some hung around the Seafarers ' International Union in Brooklyn , hoping for a job , but few of them succeeded  --  they were too young and not strong enough for the work . They talked about Zen Buddhism , Ezra Pound , the atom bomb , mystical experiences . There was a little marijuana around , but the big kicks were in drinking three bottles of terpin hydrate cough syrup or washing down a can of nutmeg with a glass of milk . Or getting drunk like Dylan Thomas ; or trying to grow a beard . It was my beard that gained me entry . I had stopped shavingwhen I worked the night shift at the bakery and still had it the day I shambled in to register for classes . It was bright red , cut square across the bottom . They complimented me on it and I explained its redness by saying that Vivaldi 's hair was the same color . I suppose I should have kept to myself , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I liked the company ,  |p114the  spirit of careless romance in the younger kids . People called them " beatniks , " already a dated word then , but they thought of themselves as " the folk . " I moved into the top floor of a coffee shop , and generally I stuck close to them , proving my friendship the only way I knew , buying beer for them , lending them money , trying to set them straight on Ezra Pound , who was a fake poet but a genuine fascist ; and I kept my hot eyes on the long-haired girls who strummed guitars and wrote poems in black sweaters and dancers ' tights . I wrote poems , too , unfashionable rhyming ones : Is that the wind ? I asked my friend , That shakes the trees and makes them bend ? In a group of six or seven grim-looking undergraduates I was the big bearded one in army fatigues , older than the others and trying to look inconspicuous ; and more than likely there would be a small pale girl next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you were my age , " she would say , and go on cracking my heart , bending my ear . It did not last long . My reading only trained me to read better . What I wrote sounded like what I read : " A cold dark November in my soul , " I 'd write , and then furiously cross it out , or again and again , " I was born in the year 1918 , in the North End of the city of Boston , the second child of two transplanted Italians  --  " Then half a chapter about childhoodfears  --  not the informed apprehension of the adult , but the impatient uncertainty of the little boy who was always made to wait , who thought he might die in his bed if the lamp was switched off and whose pleasures were his thumb , and the minutes after confession and the time spent in a slate urinal , pissing with one hand and eating an icecreamsandwich with the other . To sit down and write Chapter One  --  Childhood was to begin a book rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . My character'sname was Jack Flowers , not John Fiori . A first-lovep115chapter and an army chapter loomed , and Jack was going to discover the simplicity of love and the surprise of wealth . If the book succeeded I would write another about success ; if it failed , about failure . The fellers in the coffee shop asked me what my book was about . I said , " It 's about this guy who 's trying to write a book  --  " Writing bored me , and it sickened me in my attic to , be staring at a white sheet of paper ( " Chapter One " ) while the sun was shining outside and everyone else was at play , for every word I wrote seemed a denial of the complex uniquenessI could see just outside the window . My descriptions reduced what lacy trees and grass I could see to sorry props on the page , and my characters were either brutes or angels , too extreme and simple to be human . Still , fiction seemed to give me the second chances life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my short time as a student the artistic fringe people switched from getting drunk to getting high . I could cope with alcohol , but drugs baffled me , and I did n't even know that the pills I was taking to get my weight down , little heart-shaped orange tablets , were a kind of pep pill . " John , " a girl said , seeing me swallow one , " what 's that ? " I was too embarrassed to explain that they had been prescribedto reduce my waistline . They killed my appetite : skinny fellers had more girl friends . I said , " It 's just a tablet . I do n't even know the name  --  " " Dexedrine , " she said . " Fantastic . " " You want one ? Here , take a dozen . " " Cool . " She swallowed three . " You wo n't want any lunch , " I said . " Crazy . " She shuddered . That amused me . Handing out these reducing tablets won me the girl friends I had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . But happiness is a blurred memory of sensational lightness ; fear and boredom leave me with a re/membrance of particular details . I recall the discomfort : squatting or sitting cross-legged on the floor , listening to long poems by nineteen-year-olds beginning , I have seen . . .  --  getting cramps behind my knees , my back aching  --  And I have seen . . . I made myself sick on that sweet wine ( " Look out , John 's barfing ! " ) and they talked about Zen , rejection slips from quarterlies with names like The Goatsfoot , ban-the-bomb , Ezra P. I would be dying for a hot bath . I admired their resilience ; they could stay up all night gabbing , eating nothing but Dexedrines and cough syrup ; I 'd say , " Hell , I hate to be a party-pooper , but  --  " and crawl off to bed , hearing And I have seen  --  all the way to my room . The next morning I 'd see them stretched out on the floor , paired up but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their shoes . They invented a past for me . I deserved it ; I had not told them a thing about myself . They intended flattery , but thej+I stories were truly monstrous : " You 've got a wife and kids somewhere , have n't you ? " a girl whispered to me in my attic , candid in the dark after love . Another , rolling over , said , " Do anything you want to me  --  I know you 're a switch hitter . " I was a genius ; I was a deserter ; I was shell-shocked ; I was a refugee ; I sometimes took a knife to bed ; the Germanstortured me . The stories were too ridiculous to deny , the truth too boring to repeat . I had grown to like the kids ; I did not want to disappoint them . I used to make the eyes of those lovely girls bright by saying , " If I laid you once I 'd turn you into a whore . " It ended badly . The coffee shop was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent discussing music and poetrywere interpreted by the neighbors as sex orgies . We got strange phone calls , and visits at odd hours from welldressedmen . The police raided us . I say " raided . " Two cops opened the door and said , " We 've had a complaint about you . "  | " Let 's see your search warrant , " I said . It seemed a good gambit , but they were n't buying it . " Out of the way , fatso , " they said , pushing past me . They went upstairs , rousing people and saying , " Nothing here , " and " Okay in here . " Soon they were back in the hall , surrounded by angry poets and pretty girls . One cop showed me his white glove . The palm was filled with Dexedrines . " Whose are these ? " They were n't mine . I had stopped taking them , though I still passed them around . I said , " Mine . " " No , they 're not , " said a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're his , " said the cop , " so shut up . " " Anyway , what 's the problem ? " I said . " I take these things to kill my appetite . I got a weight problem . " " You got a problem , fella , " the cop said , " but it ai n't no weight problem . Better come along with us . " Rita screamed at him . In the squad car the cop driving said , " We know all about you and those kids . You should be ashamed of yourself . " I was charged with possessing drugs without a prescription , procuring drugs for a minor , and on hearsay , on charges of fornication , bigamy , homosexuality , and petty theft . My trial would be in three weeks . Bail was steep , but the coffee shop fellers and some sympathetic faculty membersstarted a fund and bailed me out ; they told me I was being victimized . Jumping bail was easy ; the only loss was the money . I took a Greyhound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flew to Hong Kong and signed on the Allegro . It was not despair ; it was the convenience of flight , an expensive exit that was possible because it was final . I had no intention of going back . It would have been bad for my heart , and I 'm using that word in its older sense.  |p118And  : " Flowers , " said the skipper of the Allegro , reading my name from the crew list . He made a mark on the paper . " Age  --  thirty-eight . Single . No identifying marks or scars . " He looked up . " Your first contract , I see . Know anything about oiling ? " " No , " I said , " but I do n't think it would take me long to learn . " " What can you do ? " " Anything , " I said .

Fresh eggs  --  "  |p119A  YEAR LATER , nimble in my soft white shoes , I was guiding a deeply tanned cruise passenger in his club blazer through the low sidewalk corridors of Singapore back lanes . It was night , dark and smelly in the tunnel-like passageways , and quiet except for the occasional snap of mahjong tiles and the rattling of abacus beads  --  no voices  --  coming from the bright cracks in burglar doors on shophouse fronts . Some shops , caged by protective steel grates , showed Chinese familiessitting at empty tables under glaring bulbs and the gazes from the walls of old relations with small shoulders and lumpy heads in blurred brown photograph ovals  --  the lighted barred room like an American museum-case tableauof life-size wax figures depicting Chinese at night , the seated mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a coconut row at the far edge of the table . Sikh watchmen huddled , hugging themselves in bloomers and undershirts on string beds outside dark shops ; we squeezed past them and past the unsleeping Tamil news vendors playing poker in lotus postures next to their shuttered goods cupboards . Here was a Chinese man in hisp120pajamas , crouching on a stool , smoking , clearing his throat , watching the cars pass . Farther along , four children were playing tag , chasing each other and shrieking in the dark ; and under a street-corner lamp , a lone child tugged at an odd flying toy , a live beetle , captive on a yard of thread  --  he flung it at us as we passed and then pulled it away , laughingin a shy little snort . " Atmosphere , " murmured the feller . " You said it . " There was a quicker way to Muscat Lane , but that took you over uncovered sidewalks , past new shops , on a well-lighted street . The atmosphere was an easy detour . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad the shops are closed , " I said . " One down this way has bottles filled with dead frogs and snakes  --  right in the window . Frog syrup . Sort of medicine . The mixture  --  two spoonfuls three times daily . Hnyeh ! " " You seem to know your way around . " " Well , I live here , you see . " " Funny , meeting someone who actually lives in a place like this , " said the feller . " I 'm glad I ran into you . " " Always glad to help out . You looked a bit lost , " I said . I had met him in the Big South Sea , and all I had said  --  it was my new opening  --  was " Kinda hot . " " By the way , it 's not very far from here . " " Wait , " he said , and touched my arm . " Is that a rat ? " A smooth dark shape , flat as a shadow , crept out of the monsoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cat , " I said . " Millions of them around here . " I stamped my foot ; the rat turned swiftly and dived back into the drain . " A small pussy cat . " " I 've got a thing about rats . " There was a child 's fearful quaver in his voice . " So do I ! " I said , so he would not be embarrassed . " They scare the living daylights out of me . Feller I know has doz/ens of them in the walls of his house . They scratch around at night  --  " " Please . " " Oh , sorry , " I said . " Not to worry . Take a left  --  mind your head . " We passed under a low black archway into Sultana Street ; a darkened shophouse smelling gloriously of cinnamon made me slow down to take a good whiff of the sweet dust in the air . Then we turned again into an alley of wet cobblestoneswhere there was no sidewalk , Muscat Lane . " I never would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I could tell by his voice that he had turned to look back . He was nervous . " That 's what I 'm here for ! " I said , trying to calm him with heartiness . " I just hope they 're not all asleep . " I stopped at an iron gate , the only opening in a high cement wall , burglar-proofed with rows of sharp iron crescents instead of broken glass bristles . The house had once belonged to a wealthy Muslim , and the iron gate was worked in an Islamic design . Across the alley , four yellow windowsquaresin the back of a shophouse illustrated the night : a Chinese man and wife faced each other in chairs at one ; above them a schoolboy , holding a fistful of his hair , wrote at a desk ; next to him , an old man looked into a mirror , scraping his tongue with a stick ; and in the yellow window under the old man 's an old lady nuzzled an infant . " It 's night , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like an oven . " A padlock chained to the bars held the gate shut . I was rapping the lock against a bar . " Yes ? " A dim face and a bright flashlight appeared at the side of the gate . " Mr. Sim , is that you ? " " Jack , " said Mr. Sim . " Yeah , how are they treating you ? I thought you might bep122in the sack . Look , have you got a girl you can spare ? " " Got , " said Mr. Sim . " Good , I knew I could count on you . But the thing is , we 're in kind of a rush  --  my friend 's ship is leaving in the morning  --  " " Six-twenty , " said the feller anxiously , still glancing around. "  --  and he does n't want one too old , " I said . The feller 's instruction meant he wanted one younger than himself ; that was simple  --  he was over sixty , and no hooker downtownwas over thirty . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nice and clean . They 're clean , are n't they ? The feller was asking about that . " " Clean , " said Mr. Sim . " Fine , " I said . " So can we come in and have a look-see ? " " Can , " he said . He undid the chain and swung the gate open . " Come in , please . " " A red light , " said the feller . " Appropriate . " " Yes , sir , appropriate all right ! " I said , stepping back . " After you . " He was mistaken , but so pleased there was no point in correcting him . The red light was set in a little roofed box next to the door . It was a Chinese altar ; there was a goldleafpicture inside , a bald fanged warrior-god , grinning in a billowing costume , wearing a halo of red thunderbolts . He carried a sword  --  a saint 's sword , clean and jeweled . A plate of fresh oranges , a dish of oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been set before it on a shelf . The feller had seen the light but not the altar . It was just as well : it might have alarmed him to know that the girls prayed and made offerings to that fierce god . " Cigarette ? " asked Mr. Sim , briskly offering a can of them . " Tea ? Beer ? Wireless ? " He flicked on the radio , tuned it to the English station , and got waltz music . " I buy that wireless set  --  two week . Fifty-over dollar . Too much-lah . But - ! " He clapped his hands and laughed , becomingp123hospitable  --  " Sit ! Two beers , yes ? Jack ! Excuse me . " He disappeared through a door . " So far , so good , " said the feller , fastidiously examining the sofa cushion for germs before he sat down and looked around . He seemed satisfied . It was what he expected , obviously the parlor of a brothel , large , with too much furniture , smelling of sharp perfume and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding many boisterous ghosts and having a distinct shabbiness without there being anything namably shabby in it . The light bulb was too small for the room , the uncarpeted floor was clean in the unfinished way that suggestedit was often very dirty and swept in sections . It was a room which many people used and anyone might claim , but in which no one lived . The calendar and clock were the practical oversized ones you find in shops ; the landscapeprint on the wall and the beaded doilies on the side tables looked as if they had been left behind rather than arrangedthere , and they emphasized rather than relieved the bareness . The room was a good indicator of the size and feel of the whole house , a massive bargelike structure moored at Muscat Lane . Outside , the date 1910 was chiseled into a stone shield above the door ; the second-floor verandah had a balconyof plump glazed posts  --  green ones , like urns ; the tiled roof had a border of carved wooden lace , and barbed wire  --  antique enough to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting columns of the verandah . The feller sniffed : he knew where he was . In the room , as in all brothel rooms , a carnal aroma hung in the air , as fundamental as sweat , the exposed odor from the body 's most private seams . " Ordinarily , " I said , " Mr. Sim would n't have opened up for just anyone . Like I say , he knows me . They all do . Not that I 'm bragging . But it 's the convenience of it . " " I 'm very grateful to you , " he said . He was sincere . Thep124house on Muscat Lane was a classic Asian massage parlor and brothel . If it had been a new semidetached house on a suburbanstreet he would not have stayed . But when he spoke there was the same nervous quaver in his voice as when he had spied the rat . He was trembling , massaging his knees . That made half the excitement for a feller , the belief that it was dangerous , illegal , secretive ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in little gulps . A feller'sfear was very good for me and the girls : it made the fellerquick ; he 'd pay without a quibble and take any girl that was offered ; he 'd fumble and hurry , not bothering to take his socks off or get under the sheet . Fifteen minutes later he 'd be out of the room , grinning sheepishly , patting his belt buckle , glancing sideways into a mirror to see whether he was scratched or bitten  --  and I 'd be home early . I dislikedthe fellers who had no nervous enthusiasm , who sat sulkily in chairs nursing a small Anchor , as gloom-struck and slow as if they were at the dentists , and saying , " She 's too old , " or " Got anything a little less pricy ? " " I wonder what 's keeping your friend , " said the feller , leaning over to look through the door . The movement made him release one knee ; that leg panicked and jumped . " He 'll be along in a jiffy , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for you . " " I was going to ask you something , " the feller said . " The purser on the ship said there were pickpockets here . Peoplein Singapore are supposed to be very light fingered . " " You do n't have to worry about that , " I said . " I was just asking , " he said . " The purser lost a month 's salary that way . " " It happens , sure , " I said . " But no one can take that fat pig-skin thing you cart around . " " How did you  --  ? " He hitched forward and slapped his backside . " It 's gone ! " I pulled his wallet out of my pocket and threw it over to him . " Do n't get excited . I pinched it when we saw the rat.  |p125It  was hanging out a mile  --  I figured you might lose it . " The explanation upset him . He checked to see that all the money was there , then tucked the wallet inside his blazer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  " I started , and tried to laugh , but at that momentMr . Sim came through the door with Betty , who was carrying a tray with two beers and some cold towels on it . " Hi , sugar , " I said . The nutcracker , I called her , because her legs were shaped exactly like that instrument ; she was not simply bowlegged  --  her legs had an extraordinary curvature , and the way they angled into the hem of her skirt gave no clue to how they could possibly be hinged . Her legs were the kind a child draws on the sketch of a girl , a stave at each side of a flat skirt . Betty poured the beers and handed us each a cold towel with a pair of tongs . She took a seat next to the feller and waited for him to wipe his face with the towel and have a sip of the beer before she put her brave hand casually into his lap . The feller clutched his blazer , where he had stuck the wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The feller looked at me . " They understand that my ship is leaving at six-twenty ? " " She know , " said Mr. Sim . " I tell her . Betty very nice girl . She . . . good . " " She 's a sweetheart . She 'll really go to town on you , " I said to the feller ; and to Betty , " You take good care of him  --  he 's an old pal of mine . " I stood up . " Well , nice meeting you . " " You 're not going , are you ? " said the feller . He plucked Betty 's hand out of his lap and stood up . " Things to do , " I said , burying my face in the cold towel . " I 've got to get some rest  --  the fleet 's in this week . Those fellers run me ragged . " " I 'll never find my way back . "  | " Can ring for a taxi , " said Mr. Sim . " Where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stay , " he whispered , " please . I 'll pay for your trouble . " " No trouble at all , " I said . " I just wanted to help you out . You looked lost . " " I 'll treat you to one , " he said confidentially . " It does n't cost me anything , " I said . " I thought maybe you were doing this for the money . " " I get my share from Mr. Sim , " I said . " Do n't worry about that . " " So there 's no way I can get you to stay ? " " You can ask . " " I 'm asking , for Pete 's sake ! " " Okay , I 'll hang on here , " I said . " Take your time . " " Thanks a million , " he said , and nodded in gratitude . " What your name ? " asked Betty , steering him out of theroom , carrying his glass of beer . " Oh , no you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on the stairs . " He 'll be back in ten minutes , " I said to Mr. Sim . " No , no ! " said Mr. Sim . " Rich fella  --  old man . Halfhouror more-lah . " " Bet you a fiver . " " Bet , " said Mr. Sim , eager to gamble . We put our money on the table and checked our watches . " Quiet tonight , " I said . " Last night ! English ship ! Fifty fella ! " He shook his head . " All the girls asleeping now . Tired ! You like my new wireless set ? " " Nifty , " I said . " Nice tone . It 's a good make . " " The fella come back , he want me to eat a mice ? " It was Mr. Sim 's party trick . He ate live ones whole to astonishand mortify rowdy seamen ; he appeared beside a fellerwho was getting loud and offered a handful of them.  |p127When  they were refused , Mr. Sim would dangle one before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop it in like a peanut , saying , " Yum , yum ! " It was a shrewd sort of clowning , and it never failed to quiet a customer . " I do n't think so , " I said . " Might give him a fright . He 's scared of rats . " " Rats , " Mr. Sim laughed . " During Japanese occupation we eating them . " " Rat foo Yong , " I said . " Yech . " " No , " Mr. Sim said , seriously . " Egg very scarce . We make with tow foo , little bit chilies , and choy-choy . " He wrinkled his nose . " We hungry-lah . " " I 'm not scared of rats , " I said . " But I really hate cockroaches . I suppose you could say I 'm scared of them . " And what else ? I thought  --  odd combinations : locked rooms , poverty , embarrassment , torture , secret societies , someone in a club asking me " Who are you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , Mr. Sim ? " " No , " he said firmly , and he looked handsome . " What about the police ? " " These Malay boys ? I not scared . But they making trouble on me . " " Buy them off , " I said . " I buy-lah , " he said . " I give kopi-money . Weekly ! " " So what 's the problem ? " " These politics , " said Mr. Sim . " The other year some fella in here shopping votes  --  Okay , Sim Xiensheng , vote for me-lah '  --  and now they wanting close up house . Pleh ! " He laughed  --  the insincere , unmodulated Chinese cackle , the mirthless snort of a feller surprised by a strong dig in the ribs . It was brief , it had no echo . He said , " They close up house  --  where we can go ? What we can do ? " " Go someplace where they ca n't find you , " I said . " I know a few . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my own , something really fancy . " Mine would be at thep128edge of town , a large house with stained-glass windows  --  dolphins , lilies , and white horses  --  to keep the sun out ; an orchestra in the parlor  --  six black South Indians with brilliantinedhair , wearing tuxedos , playing violins ; silk cushionson the divans , gin drinks and sweet sherbets . " Jack 's place , " they 'd call it . Mr. Sim laughed again , the same reluctant honking . " You not start a house . You get trouble , " " Well , no more than you . " " More , " said Mr. Sim , and he showed me his face , the Hakka mask of a tough pug , the broad bony forehead , no eyebrows , just a fold in the brow , the swollen eyes and lower lip thrust out and the hard angular jaw . He said again , " More . " The door opened . " Hi there , " said the feller , moving quickly toward us . " Sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch and grunted . " That 's mine , I believe , " I said , and scooped up the ten dollars from the table . The feller sat down . Betty brought him a glass of tea and a hot towel . The feller wiped his hands thoroughly , then started on his chin , but thought better of it and made a face ; he dropped the towel on the tin tray . " Shall we go ? " " I 'll just knock this back , " I said , showing him my glass of beer . " Wo n't be a minute . " He had crossed his legs and was kicking one up and down and attempting to whistle . What looked like impatience was shame . " Betty . . . good , " said Mr. Sim . " Very pleasant , " said the feller . But he avoided looking at Betty as he said so . To me , he said , " You must find Singaporea fascinating place . I wish we had more time here . We 've got three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there  --  then  --  " " Nice watch , " said Mr. Sim . " Omega . How much ? "  | " Thank you , " said the feller , and pulled his sleeve down to cover it . " Er , should n't we be going ? " " Plenty of time , " I said . " It 's only a little after eleven . Say , how 'd it go inside ? " " Not , um , too bad , " he said , still kicking his leg . " Say , I really think we must  --  " " Jack , " said Betty . " Yoh ? " " He got one this big ! " She measured eight inches with her hands . It was a vulgar gesture  --  the feller winced  --  but her hands were so small and white , the bones so delicate , they made it graceful , turning the coarseness into a dancer 's movement . Only her open mouth betrayed the vulgarity . I saw a tattoo on her arm and reached over to touch it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where 'd you get it ? " " No , " she said . She covered it . The feller coughed , stood up , and started for the door . " See you next time , " said Mr. Sim . " Thanks a lot , " I said . " Do n't mention . Bye-bye , mister , " he called to the feller . Then Mr. Sim drew me aside . " You taking girls out to ships , some people they do n't like this but I say forget it . Everybody know you a good fella and I say jack my friend . No trouble from Jack . Two hand clap , one hand no clap . But you listen . You do n't pay kopi-money . You do n't start up a house , or  --  " He rubbed his nose with the knuckles of his fist and looked at the floor , saying softly , " Chinese fella sometime very awkward . " " Do n't worry about me , " I said . " Would it be safe to take a taxi ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sultana Street . " Oh , sure , " I said , and flagged one down . On the way to the pier I said , " It 's rather late for intros , but anyway . My name 's Jack Flowers  --  what 's yours ? " " Milton , " he said quickly . " George Milton . If you'rep130ever in Philadelphia it 'd be swell to see you . I wish I had one of my business cards to give you , but I 'm fresh out . " " That 's all right , " I said . He was lying about his name , which on the I.D . card in his wallet was W. M. Griswold ; and his address was in Baltimore . It might have been an innocentlie , but it hurt my feelings : he did n't want to know me . I had rescued him , and now he was going away . " The first thing I 'm going to do when I get down to my cabin is brush my teeth , " he said . The taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Will you take twenty bucks ? " " Now ? " I said . " Yes . " " Be good , " he said , handing it over . It was still early and I was within walking distance of the seafront bars . I strolled along the pier , stepping carefully so I would n't get my shoes dirty on the greasy rope that lay in coils between the parked cars and taxis . At Prince EdwardRoad , near the bus depot , two fellers were standing under a streetlamp trying to read what looked like a guidebook . They were certainly tourists , and probably from Griswold'sliner ; both wore the kind of broad-brimmed hat strangers imagine to be required headgear in the tropics . It gave them away instantly : no one in Singapore wore a hat , except the Chinese , to funerals . I walked over to them and stopped , rattling coins in my pocket with my fist and negligently whistling , as if waiting for a bus . Their new shoes confirmed they were strangers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their halfinchsoles said they were Americans . " Kinda hot . " They turned and enthusiastically agreed . Then they asked their reckless question in a mild way . I nodded , I whistled , I shook my jingling coins ; I was the feller they wanted.  |p131It  was so easy I could not stop . I hustled at a dead run until the streets were empty and the bars closed . New to the enterprise , I had the beginner 's stamina . It was n't the money that drove me ; I ca n't call it holy charity , but it was as close to a Christian act as that sort of friendly commerce could be , keeping those already astray happy and from harm , within caution 's limits . I raided my humanity to console them with reminders of safety , while reminding myself of the dangers . I was dealing with the very innocent , blind men holding helpless sticks ; their passions were guesses . It especially wounded me that Griswold had lied about his name : in my conscientious shepherding I believed I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than urging , I paid close attention to a feller'sneed and was protective , adaptable , and well-known for being discreet . In those days it mattered , and though I acted this way out of kindness , not to impress anyone as a smoothie , it won me customers . There were so many then , and so grateful . I should n't remember Griswold among them , for he was so typical as to be unmemorable  --  something about the very desire for sex or the illicit made a feller anonymous without trying . But Griswold had lied ; the lie marked him and identified his otherwise nameless face and brought back that evening . His distrust made me relax my normally cautious discretion , and for years afterward if a feller said he was from Baltimore I replied , " Know a feller named Griswold there ? " Some knew him , or said they did , and one night a feller said , " Yes , we were great friends . That was such a damned shame , was n't it ? " And I never mentioned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOUSE on Muscat Lane was one of several in Singapore that did business in the old way . Any port is bound to cater to the sexually famished , but the age and wealth of a city , until recently , could be determined by how central the brothels were . Once , in old and great cities , they were alwaysconvenient , off shady boulevards , a stone 's throw from the state house ; in the postwar boom they went suburban to avoid politicians and high rents ; then they moved back to the center  --  Madam Lum 's place was near a supermarket  --  and it was no longer possible to tell from their location the city 's age , though prosperity could still be measured by the number of whores in a place : the poorest and most primitive , having none , made do with forced labor , blackmail , or unsatisfying casual arrangements in ditches and alleyways and in the rear seats of cars . Singapore was very old then , not in years but in attitude and design because of the way the immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district , Fukien in another . As a feller who had seen Naples and Palermo duplicated down to buildingp133styles , hawkers ' cries , gangster practices , and patron saints in the North End of Boston , I understood that traditional instinct to preserve . The completely Chinese flavor of vice in Singapore made it attractive to a curious outsider , at the same time releasing him from guilt and doubt , for its queer differences ( Joyce Li-ho had the tattoo of a panther leaping up her inner thigh ) made it a respectable diversion , like the erotic art anthropologists solemnly photograph , maharaniand maharajah depicted as fellatrix and bugger on the Indian temple . The sequence of activities in a Chinese brothel parodied Oriental hospitality : the warm welcome  --  the host bowing from the waist  --  the smoke , the chat , the cold towel , then the girl  --  usually the feller chose from one in a parade ; money changed hands in the bedroomwhen the feller was naked and excited ; then the stunt itself , and afterward , a hot towel and a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironed bedsheets and yapped beyond the rail . It was the Chinese host 's puritanism , his ability to make pleasure into a ritual , that added so much enjoyable delay to it . And though the Chinese customers with a harelike speed treated the whole affair with no more concern than we would in popping out for a quick hamburger , the fellers I took along , mainly gawking travelers bent on carrying away an armload of souvenirs , welcomed the chance to enter , and more than enter  --  participate  --  in a cultural secret , to be alone with the exotic Oriental girl in a ceremonial state of undress , and later to have that unusual act of love to report upon . It was much appreciated because it was perfectcandor , private discovery , the enactment of the white bachelor 's fantasy , the next best thing to marrying a sweet obedient Chinese girl . I could provide , without danger , the ultimate souvenir : the experience , in the flesh , of fantasy . By never putting a price on my services , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans treating it , they 'd say , as part of their education , continentals looking on it as a kind of critical therapy , the English preferring not to discuss it  --  I always came out better . I was prompt and responsive ; I did n't insist on my presence ; and I had a sense of humor . " That was quite an experience , " the feller would say , his face flushed . " Glad you approved , " I 'd say , hailing my trishaw for the ride home . " You 've been a great help . Really , I  --  " " Do n't mention it . It 's just a question of mind over matter , ai n't it ? " " How 's that ? " " I do n't mind and you do n't matter  --  hyah ! " My dedication to these souls , whom anyone else would call suckers , was so complete it made me unselfish in a way that calmed and rewarded me , for paradoxically it was this unselfish dedication that was commercially useful  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool as to think that the money had been virtuously earned  --  there was no brotherhoodin a cash transaction ; my small virtue was a fidelity to other people 's passion , but I would not martyr myself for it , I expected some payment . I was not a pimp with a heart of gold ; however , I knew and could prove that I had saved many fellers from harm and many girls from brutes  --  not only from greedy cabbies , but the curfew districts controlled by the secret societies , the streets where all the pretty girls were men with kukris in their handbags , the girls with pox , the sadists , the clip joints , the houses you came away from with the fungus on your pecker known as " Rangoon Itch . " " I 've saved a lot of fellers from Rangoon Itch in my time , " is hardly a saintly testimony , but it might be the epitaph of a practical man who gave relief the only way he could , trusting instinct and operating in the dark . Ip135took blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Useful Man , my tombstone motto would go . I was a knowledgeable friend in a remote place , able to read obscure and desperate verbal signals ; with a deliberately corny sense of humor  --  the undemanding comedy that relaxed the fellers by avoidingall off-color or doubtful jokes , specifically the ones relatingto lechery , which in the circumstances could only annoythe fellers by mocking or challenging their heat . And Singapore helped . It was that atmosphere that had been exported with the immigrants from China and the oldie-worldie style of the city 's subdivision into districts . To say that there was only one street in Singapore where you could buy a mattress is to describe the rigidness of the pattern ; ship chandlers occupied one street , coffin makers another , banks another , printeries another . Brothels took up a whole block , mixed higgledy-piggledy with Chinese hotels , from Muscat Lane to Malacca Street , and the area was self-contained , bordered on one side by bars and noodle shops and on the other by laundries and pox doctors . " It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without fuss , the excesses of Shanghai were available in the dream district  --  opium dens here , brothels and massage parlors and cockfights there  --  constructed by the wishful immigrant who in his homesick fantasy remembered a childhood longing for wealth and provided for his pleasure with the tourists ' subsidy . An American appropriately complimentedthe unreality of it by saying , " It 's just like a movie ! " " Jack , I want to tell you I feel very lucky , " the same feller went on . " Give them a few years and they 'll pull this all down and build over it  --  apartment houses , car parks , pizza joints , every lousy thing they can think of . Tokyo 's already getting commercialized . " We were on Sago Lane , near Loon 's Tip-Top ; through the upstairs window of Loon 's we could see two Chinese girls inp136red dresses , one smoking and looking out at the sky , the other combing her long hair . " They 'll put a gas station there or some dumb thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " It 'll just ruin it . " " It makes my blood boil , " I said . But I could not match his anger . Then he said something I have thought of many times since : " I feel damned lucky , " he said . " At least I can say I knew what it was like in the old days . " Nineteen fifty-nine ! The old days ! But he was right ; it was pleasant then , and it changed . Answering the squalor of the city were the girls ; noiseless and glittering and narrow as snakes , they looked like anyone'sidea of the Oriental concubine . That was theatrical , a kind of costuming : the whore 's mask depicted the client 's sexual ideal  --  they were expected to pose that way , as in white shoes , I was expected to look like a pimp . It was the nearest word , but it did n't describe me : I was gentle . The girls were practical and businesslike . Their obsession was with good health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor surgery , assisting like sexy nurses , those dentist 's helpers who worked on complicated extractions , bending over a feller 's open mouth , making him comfortableand being quick when he grunted unusually . They believed in ghosts and had a horror of hair and kissing and stinks and dirt , and complained we smelled like cheese . Some did n't feel a thing , but just lay there sacrificed and spread and might say , " You are finished , yes ? " before a fellerhad hardly started . Most had the useful skill of the reliableworker , the knack of being able to do their job convincinglyand well without having the slightest interest in it , and all had the genius to be remote at the moment of greatest intimacy , a contemplative gift . They were **25;14868;TOOLONG , but they swore in English , and I wasp137certain from the soft way they spoke to each other in Chinesethat they seldom swore in their own language , and had that learner 's curious habit of finding it easy to say " fuck " in another tongue , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has learned it early in life and knows its social limits . Dirty talk stimulated a lot of fellers , but left others cold . I remember a feller demanding to leave the Honey Bar , and as we left , saying disgustedly , " I could never screw a girl that said bullshit . Bullshit this , bullshit that . I 'm not a machine . I like a girl I can talk to , a little human warmth . " Many of the girls were modest in a conventional way , which even as a pretense was a compelling sexiness in a whore : " I could n't get the little doll to take her dress off , " was a frequent comment from the fellers , and as no tipping was allowed in the houses , no amount of money could persuadethe girls to disrobe . Yet far from diminishing their effectiveness it made them sought-after ; any variation increaseddesire and the silk dresses gave these cold quick girls an accidental allure , titillating by flouncy mystification , partly concealing the act in the dark , keeping enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be provoked . A girl stark naked was not sexy . Hing was driven wild by even a clothed woman on all fours  --  as long as she was Australian and large ; Ogham said the finest pleasure was to stick an ice pick into a woman 's bloomered bottom ; and once in the Bandung , when we were on the subject , Yardley said with awful sincerity , " Jesus , I love to see a woman with her mouth hanging open . " I knew the girls too well to think of them as kindly and cheerful , but they understood their cues and were dependable . Observe what virtue was in them : obedience , usefulness , reliability , economy  --  not mortification and solitary prayer . On one occasion , boarding a launch for a run out to a ship , Doris Goh ( never absent , never late ) stumbledp138and fell into the water at the quayside . She could not swim and went rigid as soon as she went under . I hauled her out ; soaking wet , her dress stuck to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a heavy rope of loose braid . I told her she could go home if she wanted to , but she said no and soldiered on , earning forty dollars in the wheel house while her dress dried on a hanger in the engine room . They were unambitious in some ways , but not at all lazy and did n't steal . So it surprised me  --  my amusement crept upon by an old slow fear  --  when I opened the Straits Times and saw , under ISLAND-WIDE VICE RING BROKEN - JOO CHIAT RAIDNETS 35 , a photograph of five girls being dragged by the arms toward a police van while grim Malay policemen watched , sturdily planted on widely spread bandy legs , holding trucheons and riot shields . The girls ' faces were very white from the flash bulb 's brightness and their astonished eyebrowswere high and black , their objecting mouths in the attitude of shouting . That they were objecting did not surprise me  --  they were indignant , an emotion as understandablein them as in any harmless lathe operator yanked from his machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joo Chiat house was thought to be safe , with a Chinese clientele , protected by the fierce Green Triangle secret societywhose spiderlike and pockmarked members could be seen at any time of the day or night playing cards by the back entrance , their knives and bearing scrapers close to hand . The article in the paper said this was " the first raid in an all-out campaign launched by the P.A.P . to rid the islandof so-called massage parlors . " There were two raids the following day . One at an opium den resulted in the arrests of seven elderly men , six of whose worried , sunken-eyed faces appeared in the paper ; the seventhwas pictured on a stretcher with his hands clasped  --  he had broken his leg when he slipped trying to escape acrossp139a steep tile roof . The second raid was at a massage parlor very close to Muscat Lane where all the girls , and the decor , were Thai . The raids disturbed me , but the picture I made of it in my mind was not of the girls  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pajamas across a clattering rooftop . I decided to lie low that night at the Bandung . " You do n't understand the political background , Jack , " Yates said . " I 'd steer clear of Chinatown if I were you . " " Do n't say we did n't warn you , " said Yardley . " I never go to Chinatown , " said Froggett . " Bloody waste of time . " " Harry Lee 's putting the boot in , " said Smale . " I hate that little sod . " " I was just wondering what was going on , " I said . " Nothing that concerns you , " said Yardley . " So keep out of it . " The next morning I went to see Mr. Sim . He seemed suspiciousat my arriving so early , and reluctantly let me in . I asked him about the raids . " Must be careful , " he said . " How Kheng Fatt is keeping , okay ? " " Hing ? He 's doing all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , unless I 've got business on a ship . " " So what you are worried ? You got a job , neh ? " " If you want to call it that . Look , I earn peanuts there  --  little-little money . I ca n't bank on it . If they go on closing the houses down and arresting the girls I 'm going to be out of luck . And so are you ! " " Better than in jail . " " What are you going to do ? " He did n't look at me , but he showed me his face . He said , " Funny thing . You know new wireless I got ? Yes ? It don'twork now . I enjoy that wireless set , but it need repair . " " Where are you planning to go ? " I asked  |p140He  discovered his shirt and smoothed the pockets . " They say a lot of the cops are plainclothes men , " I said . " You know , Special Branch fellers wearing shirts like mine and plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay up and just before they get into the saddle they say , Okay , put your clothes on  --  you 're under arrest . ' I think that 's terrible , do n't you ? " Mr. Sim twisted the tail of his shirt , and he worked his jaw back and forth as he twisted . " I 'll level with you , Mr. Sim . The reason I came over is I 've got a plan . We know they 're trying to close things up  --  they 've already nabbed about a hundred people . So why wait ? Why not just put our heads together and set up somewheresafe . Like I was telling you . We 'll go where they least expect us , rent a big house up on Thomson Road or near a cemetery , get about ten girls or so and run a real quiet place  --  put up a sign in front saying The Wongs ' or Hillcrest ' or Dunroamin . ' What do you say to that ? " " It is a very hot day . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got much time . Are you interested or not ? " " It is a hot day , " said Mr. Sim . " I am expecting my auntie . " " No taxis allowed  --  only private cars , no syces . Girls by appointment . If you think the Dunroamin idea is silly we can put up a sign saying Secretarial School  --  Typing and Shorthand Lessons . ' No one 'll know the difference . " He had twisted his shirttail into a hank of rope and now he was knotting it . " My auntie is very old . I tell her to stop so much smoking  --  forty-over sticks a day ! But old peoples . Kss ! " " Okay , forget it . " I stood up . Mr. Sim let go of his shirt and leaped to the door . " Byebye , Jack . See you next time . Do n't mention . " That night I brought a feller to Muscat Lane . I had metp141him in a bar on Stamford Road . He had asked me if I knew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow me . But the house was in darkness , the shutters were closed , and the red light over the altar was turned off . I rapped the lock against the gate bar , but no one stirred . Mr. Sim had run out on me . " This looks like a washout , " the feller said . " I 'm not even in the mood now . " " They 're worried about the cops . There 's a political party here that 's putting the heat on  --  trying to close down the whole district . They 've got everyone scared . It did n't use to be this way , but maybe if we walk over  --  " " I do n't know why it is , " said the feller , " but people are always saying to me , You should have been here last year . ' It really burns me up . " " That 's natural , " I said . " But you got ta understand the political background , you see . " " Political background is crap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship . " " If there 's anything else you want , anything at all , " I said . " I could find you a gal easy enough . Fix you up in a hotel . Bed and breakfast . " He shook his head . " I had my heart set on a cathouse . " " We could try another one , " I said . " But I do n't want you to get in dutch . How would it look if you got your picture in the papers  --  Gripe ! " " Makes you stop and think , do n't it ? " he said . " Sure does , " I said . " But if there 's anything else  --  " " Naw , " he said , but saying so , he laughed and said again , " Naw , " as if he was trying to discourage a thought . I was hoping he did n't want a transvestite  --  it would be hours before they 'd be on Bugis Street . " What is it ? " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God , you do n't want to leave empty-handed , do you ? " " Naw , I was just kicking around an idea that popped up , "  |p142he  said , laughing down his nose . " I do n't know , I 've never seen one . " " Seen what ? " He stopped laughing and said gravely , " Back home they call them skin flicks . " The room was stifling with all the shades drawn , and the screen was a bedsheet , which struck me as uniquely repellent . We sat , six of us , wordlessly fixed on the blue squares jumping and flickering on the screen while the rattling projectorwhirred : the countdown  --  a few numbers were missing ; the title  --  something about a brush salesman ; the openingshot  --  a man knocking at a door . We fidgeted when the man knocked ; no knock was heard . It was a silent film . The absence of a soundtrack necessitated many close-ups of facial expressions ; and a story was attempted , for both characters  --  salesman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot of conquest with a naturalclimax  --  an older concept of pornography . The salesmanwore a tweed double-breasted suit and his hair was slick and wavy . I guessed it was late forties , but what country ? The housewife wore a long bathrobe trimmed with white fur , and when she sat down the front flapped open . She laughed and tucked it back together . The salesman sat beside her and rolled his eyes . He took out a pack of cigarettes and offered one , a Camel . So it was America . He opened his case of samples and pulled out a limp contraceptiveand made a face ( " Oh gosh ! " ) and shoved it back . Then there was an elaborate business with the brushes , variousshapes and sizes . He demonstrated each one by tickling the housewife in different places , starting on the sole of her foot . Soon he was pushing a feather duster under her looseningbathrobe . The housewife was laughing and trying to hold her robe shut , but the horseplay went on , the robe slipped off her shoulders. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thick velvet cushions , and just above it on the wall a picture of a stag feeding at a mountain pool . The man took off his shoes . This was interesting : he wore a suit but these were workman 's shoes , heavy-soled ones with high counters and large bulbs for toes  --  the steel-toed shoes a man who does heavy work might wear . His argyle socks had holes in them and he had a chain around his neck with a religious medal on it . His muscled arms and broad shoulders confirmed he was a laborer ; he also wore a wedding ring . I guessed he had lost his job ; as a Catholic he would not have acted in a blue movie on a Sunday , and if it was a weekday and he had a job he would not have acted in the movie at all . Out the apartmentwindow the sun shone on rooftops , but I noticed he did not take his socks off . Perhaps it was cold in the apartment . Afterward he walked back to his wife through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look what I won  --  twenty clams ! " The housewife was more complicated . Judging from her breasts she had had more than one child . I wondered where they were . There was a detailed shot of her moving her hand  --  long perfect fingernails : she did n't do housework . Who looked after her kids ? From the way she sat on the sofa , on the edge , not using the pillows , I knew it was not her apartment . She took off the fancy bathrobe with great care  --  either it was not hers ( it was rather big ) or she was poor enough to value it . She had a very bad bruise on the top of her thigh ; someone had recently thumped her ; and now I could see the man 's appendix scar , a vivid one . Two details hinted that the housewife was n't American : her legs and armpits were not shaved , and she was not speaking . The man talked , but her replies were exaggerated faces : awe , interest , lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's lips and then her head slid down his chest , past the appendix scar  --  it was fresh , the reason he was outp144of a job : he had to wait until it healed before he could go back to any heavy work . The housewife opened her mouth ; she had excellent teeth and pierced ears  --  a war bride , maybe Italian , deserted by her GI husband ( he thumped her and took the children ) . The camera stayed on her face for a long time , her profile moved back and forth , and even though it was impossible now for her mouth to show any expression , as soon as she closed her eyes abstraction was on her face  --  she was tense , her eyes were shut tight , a moment of dramatic meditation on unwilling surrender : she was n't acting . Mercifully , the camera moved to a full view of the room . On the left there was a wing chair with a torn seat , a coffee table holding a glass ashtray with cigarette butts in it ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind ?  --  perhapsrehearsed it ) , and on the right , the face of a waterstain on the wall , a fake fireplace with a half-filled bottle on the mantlepiece  --  the Catholic laborer had needed a drink to go through with it . There had been a scene . If you 're not interested we 'll find someone else . And : Okay , let 's get it over with . It was breaking my heart . There was a shot of the front door . It flew open and a large naked woman stood grinning at the pair on the floor  --  this certainly was the owner of the fancy bathrobe ( the cameraman 's girl friend ? ) . She joined them , vigorously , but I was so engrossed in the tragic suggestions I saw in their nakedness I had not questioned the door . It was a silent movie , but the door had opened with a bang and a clatter . The feller beside me had turned around and was saying , " What do we do now ? "  |p145WITH  SOME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and my tone of voice to make the story truer , by intensifyingit to the point of comedy where it was a bearable memory , my escape from the blue movie raid became part of my repertoire , and within a year I was telling it at the bar of my own place , Dunroamin : "  --  Then the Chief Inspector , a Scotty , says to me , Have I not seen you somewhere before ? ' and I says , Not the club , by any chance ? ' and he says , Jack , I 'll be jiggered  --  fancy finding you in a place like this ! ' I can explain everything , ' I says . Confidentially , I thought they were showing Gone with the Wind , ' and he laughs like hell . Look , ' he says in a whisper , I 'm a bit shortstaffed . Give me a hand rounding up some of this kit and we 'll say no more about it . ' So I unplugged the projector and carried it out to the police van and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And to top it off I still have n't found out which club he had in mind ! " I walked through the bar at Dunroamin all night , chatting fellers up , introducing the girls , and settling arguments . " If you 've got a certain attitude toward cats , you 're queer they say . Ai n't that right , Jack ? "  | " Sure . If you want to bugger a male cat , that means you 're queer , prih-hih ! " As always , my clowning went over well , but like my new version of the blue movie story it was the clowning that worriedme  --  the comedy struck unexpected notes of despair . I turned my worst pains into jokes to make myself small and to obscure my sick aches ; it was my fear of being known well and pitied  --  my humor was motivated by humility . I sang songs like " What Did Robinson Crusoe Do with Fridayon a Saturday Night ? " and saying , " I would n't have anyone here that I would n't invite into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had moved in with my amah and pets  --  as another joke . But it was no laughing matter . I had plowed my whole savings into it . My refusal to admit I took it seriously was my way of guarding against anyone feelingsorry for me if it failed . It did n't fail ; and the feature of it that I had conceived as a joke of last desperation was what saved the house from collapse . The house itself was not large , but it was walled in and set back from the road . I picked it for its high wall and rented it cheap from a superstitious towkay : it was on Kampong Java Road and the rear opened on to the Lower Bukit Timah Road cemetery . Those several acres of tombstonesand the fact of the house being associated with some Japanese atrocities accounted for the low rent , but gave me headaches when it came to getting girls to live in . The joke was the Palm Court orchestra : fellers often came and paid my slightly higher bar prices to sit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very difficult  --  the house was haunted ; finding South Indian violinistswas easy  --  many were looking for work . Mr. Weerakoonwas my first violinist ; he was backed up by Mr. ( " Manny " ) Manickawasagam and Mr. Das . Albert Ratnam played the piano , Mr. ( " Subra " ) Subramaniam the cello , Mr. Pillay the clarinet . Manny , an impressive baritone ,  |p147sometimes  sang , and Subra switched to the accordian for the faster numbers . They turned up punctually at six every evening in their old-fashioned tuxedos and bow ties , smelling of Indian talcum , breathless after their hike from Serangoon Road . Their hair was neatly parted in the middle , making two patches of brilliantined waves which shook free to glisteningblack springs as soon as they began playing . Weerakoon , who had a severely large handlebar mustache , made them practice until seven , and he interrupted them constantly , saying , " No , no , no !  --  Take that from the top again , " while looking at me out of the corner of his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A very nice rendition of Roses from the South . ' " " Hopeless . But what to do ? Ratnam ca n't read music . " " It was very bouncy . I 've never heard it played bouncy before . " " Fast tempo  --  I think it suits your house . But Pillay was dragging his feet . We need much practice . " And pinching the waxy tails of his mustache , he 'd add , " We shall have urnpleof trouble with more tricky numbers . " Weerakoon persuaded me to redecorate the front lounge and turn it into a music room . He had me print a concert card with the selections and intervals listed on it , menu fashion : he propped this on a music stand at the door . The orchestra had the effect Mr. Sim obtained by swallowing live mice  --  it fixed restless seamen into postures of calm , and later they told me Dunroamin had class . I could see them from the bar , where I stood to greet fellers arriving : a row of rough-looking men with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And all night the scree-scree from the music room took the curse off the bang= ing bedroom doors and the noisy plumbing , the creaky bedspringsand quacking fans , and that loud way the girls had of washing , sluicing themselves with dippers and gargling at the same time.  |p148The  Singapore residents , clubbable ones especially , flatteredthemselves that the Palm Court orchestra was for them , though some complained , calling Weerakoon and the others " greasy babu fiddlers . " Some said I should sack them and get a couple of girls to put on a show . But I resisted these suggestions  --  sex exhibitions saddened me nearly as much as blue movies : this panicky nakedness was desire 's dead end . The Palm Court orchestra , central to what I came to think of as my little mission station  --  a necessary comfortable house on the island outpost  --  was for the seamen . I had discovered something about them that I had been too obtuse or distracted to grasp on the Allegro : most men who go to sea are quiet and conservative by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected community on a ship where the slightest disorder can be fatal ; even the youngest have elderly cautious tastes  --  pipe-smoking and hobbies  --  and few read newspapers ; most are anxious in the company of women and very shy on land , natural drunkards and rather unsociable . It was for them that Mr. Weerakoon practiced the waltz from Swan Lake , and he encouraged them to make requests after he finished the selections listed on the concert card . Then , a seaman with a ruined face would lean over , making his wooden chair squawk , and in a gravelly voice ask for " Brightly Shines Our Wedding Day " or " Time on My Hands . " My girls passed out cold towels from trays or leaned against the walls with their thin pale arms folded , or scuffed back and forth in the flapping broken slippers they always wore . In many ways , though it was not my wish  --  I was still gropingto understand my job  --  Dunroamin was a traditional establishment , with cold towels , hot towels , glasses of tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks more expensive than in a downtown bar ; the oldest and frailest amahs did the heaviest work  --  yoked themselves to buckets of water and tottered upstairs to fill the huge stone showerp149jars , scrubbed sheets on the washboards out back , or boiled linen , which they stirred with wooden paddles , in frothy basins of hot evil-smelling water on the kitchen stove . In those same basins , after a quick rinse , they made mee-hoon soup and ladeled it out to the customers who demanded " real Chinese food . " Dunroamin worked smoothly , but it was older than my devising : the system of payment  --  the chit pads in the bar , the shakedown in the bedroom  --  the jaga at the front gate ( Ganapaty , who said , " I am a dog , only here to bark " ) , the thickly waxed oxblood-colored floors in the graceful white house , camouflaged by vast Angsana trees that dripped tiny yellow blossoms , flanked by servants ' quarters and a carriage shed ; sloping rattan chairs with leg rests on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ( though I insistedthey call me Jack ) the soft cry of " Tuan " with the morning tea , the skill of the Indian musicians and Weerakoon'shabit of saying " Blast " when he played a wrong note  --  it was all a colonial inheritance , and it had fallen to me . But if my whorehouse was a scale model of the imperial dream , I justified my exploitation by adding to it humor and generous charity , and by making everyone welcome . What Chinese fellers visited , mostly embarrassed businessmenwith names like Elliot Ching and Larry Woo , did so for the same reason the rest of the Chinese stayed away  --  because my girls made love to redheads . I watched from my corner of the long bar , near the telephone and Ganapaty'semergency buzzer , greeting arrivals with , " Glad you could make it  --  what can I do you for ? " and later watched them go down the gravel drive , each one depleted , rumpledfrom having dressed hurriedly  --  their ties and sometimestheir socks stuffed in their back pockets  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew to be the meekness that comes after spending energy in a harmless way . It was pleasant to see them leave withp150new faces and I was flattered and reassured by their promisesof generosity : " If there 's ever anything I can do for you , Jack  --  " But I was the host . " Just settle your bar bill at the end of the month , thank you , and a very good night to you all . " I got up early . In my pajamas at a sunny desk I totaled the previous night 's receipts and checked to see that the bar was well stocked and the rooms were clean  --  in each room a girl would be brushing her hair before a mirror , a houseful of girls brushing : it cheered me . It was a strenuous round of ordering and overseeing , making sure the laundry was done , the pilferage recorded , the grass cut , the house presentable ; then , I took my shower , cut across the cemetery to Lower Bukit Timah Road and caught the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the stool in my little cubicleand took orders from Hing . In the days when I had hustled on the street and in bars , saying " Kinda hot " to likely strangers , I was glad of the safety of Hing 's . I knew my job as a water clerk well enough to be able to do it easily . And though the money was nothing ( any of my girls earned more in a week ) , the stool where I hooked my heels and pored over the shipping pages of the Straits Times was important . It was the basis for my visa , a perfect alibi , and a place to roost . But the success of Dunroaminmade me consider quitting Hing 's . I continued to get friendly promises of attention from the fellers who came to Dunroamin , yet my relationship with them remained a hustler-client one . I was a regular visitor to the clubs and knew most of the members ; in the shipping offices of the Asia Insurance Building and in the Maritime Building , fellers called me by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . But they never stopped to pass the time of day . The talks I had with them took place at prearranged times and for a specific purpose ; and I was seldom introduced to their friends . I was careful not to remind them thatp151I knew more about them than their wives  --  and seeing them with their wives , by chance after a movie or at a cricket match at the Padang , it amazed me that the fellers came to Dunroamin : their wives were beautiful smiling girls ( it was about this time that I had my fling with the Tanglin Club wife whom I reported as being " ever so nice " ) . My quicknessmight have disturbed the fellers . My attention to detailin arranging for girls to be sent out to ships or for club members to make a discreet visit in a trishaw for a tumble at Dunroamin could have been interpreted as somewhat suspicious , a kind of criminal promptitude , I think , the blackmailer'sdogged precision . Still , most of the fellers insistedI should get in touch if I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a simple matter . Mr. Weerakoon said he needed new violin strings and could not find any in the shops . I knew the importer ; I had fixed him up on severaloccasions . I gave him a telephone call . " Hi , this is Jack Flowers . Say , I 've got a little problem here  --  " " I 'll ring you back , " he said quickly , and the line went dead . That was the last I heard from him . I asked about him at his club . " Why do n't you leave the poor chap alone , " one of his pals  --  also a customer of mine  --  said . " You 've got him scared rigid . He 's trying to make a decent living . If you start interfering it 'll all be up the spout . " That was the last I heard from the pal , too . I got the message , and never again asked for a favor . But they continued to be offered . They sounded sincere . Late at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of gratitudeand good will . I had made them that way : I was the kind of angel I expected to visit me . They said I should look them up in Hong Kong ; I should stop over some day and see their ships or factories ; I should have lunch with themp152one day  --  or the noncommittal , " Jack , we must really meet for a drink soon . " The invitations came to nothing ; after the business about the violin strings I never pursued them . So I stayed at Hing 's , as his water clerk , both for safety and reassurance : it was the only job I could legally admit to having  --  and soon I was to be glad I had it . A young Chinese feller came in one evening . It was beforesix , the place was empty , and I was sitting at the bar having a coffee and reading the Malay Mail . " Brandy , " he said , snapping his fingers at Yusof . " One cup . " Yusof poured a tot of brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink . I knew from his physique that the Chinese feller did not speak much English . The English-educated were plump from milk drinking , the Chinese-educated stuck to a traditionaldiet , bean curd and meat scraps  --  they were thin , weedy , like this feller , short , girlish , bony-faced . His hair was long and pushed back . His light silk sports shirt fit snugly to the knobs of his shoulders , and his wrists were so small his heavy watch slipped back and forth on his forearm like a bracelet . He kept looking around  --  not turning his head , but lowering it and twisting it sideways to glance across his arm . " Bit early , " I said . He looked into his drink , then raised it and gulped it all . It was a stagy gesture , well executed , but made him cough and gag , and as soon as he put the snifter back on the bar he went red-faced and breathless . He snapped his fingers again and said , " Kopi . " " No coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feller frowned at my cup . Yusof reached for the empty snifter . The feller snatched it up and held it . I heard footsteps on the verandah and went to the door , thinking it might be Mr. Weerakoon . I faced three Chinesep153who resembled the feller at the bar  --  short-sleeved shirts , long hair , sunglasses , skinny pinched faces . One was small enough to qualify as a dwarf . He swaggered over to a barstooland had difficulty hoisting himself up . Now the four sat in a row ; they exchanged a few words and the one who had come in first asked for a coffee again . Yusof shook his head . He looked at me . " We do n't serve coffee here , " I said . " That is kopi , " the feller said slowly . The others glared at me . " So it is , " I said . " Yusof , give the gentlemen what they want . " At once the four Chinese raised their voices , and getting courage from the little victory , one laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over to me . " You wants book ? " he asked . " What kind ? " " Special . " He unbuttoned his shirt and took out a flat plastic bag with some pamphlets inside . " Do n't bother , " I said . " Finish your coffee and hop it . " " Swedish , " he said , dangling the plastic bag . " Sorry , " I said . " I ca n't read Swedish . " " Is not necessary . Look . " He undid the bag and pulled one out . He held it up for me to see , a garish cover . I could not make it out at first , then I saw hair , mouths , bums , arms . " No thanks , " I said . " Look . " He turned the page . It was like a photograph of an atrocity , a mass killing  --  naked people knotted on a floor . " I do n't need them , " I said . He shook the picture in my face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell this creep I do n't want his pictures . " " Tuan  --  " Yusof started , but the dwarf cut him off . " You buy , " said the dwarf . " I not buy . "  |p154Now  I looked at the three fellers near the bar . The first had swiveled around on his stool . He held the brandy snifter out at arm 's length and dropped it . It crashed . Upstairs , a giggle from a girl in a beaverboard cubicle . " How much ? " I asked . " Cheap . " " Okay , I 'll take a dozen . Now get out of here . " The dwarf buttoned the pamphlets into his shirt and said , " You come outside . Plenty in car . You choose . Very nice . " I shook my head . " I not choose . I stay right here . " Glass breaks with a liquid sound , like the instantaneous threat of flood . One feller shouted , " Yoop ! " I saw Yusof jump . The mirror behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke a second time . " Tell them to stop it ! " I said , and went to the door . " Where 's your lousy car ? " A black Nissen Cedric was parked on Karnpong Java Road , just beyond the sentry box where Ganapaty was hunched over a bowl of rice . He busily pawed at the rice with his fingers . " In there , " said the dwarf , opening the trunk . There were torn newspapers inside . I turned to object . My voice would not work , my eyes went bright red , and a blood trickle burned my neck ; I seemed to be squashed insidemy eyeballs , breathing exhaust fumes and being bounced . Believe any feller who , captive for a few days , claims he has been a prisoner for months . My body 's clock stopped with the first sharp pain in my head , then time was elastic and a day was the unverifiable period of wakefulness between frequentnaps . Time , like pain , had washed over me and flooded my usual ticking rhythm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; pain became the passage of time , pulsing as Ip155drowned , smothering me in a hurtful sea of days . But it might have been minutes . I ached everywhere . For a long time after I woke they kept me roped to a bed in a hut room smelling of dust and chickens and with a corrugatediron roof that baked my broken eyes . This gave my captors problems : they had to feed me with a spoon and hold my cup while I drank . They took turns doing this . They untied me , removing everything from the room but a bucket and mattress , and they brought me noodles at regular intervals . My one comfort was that obviously they did not plan to kill me . They could have done that easily enough at Dunroamin . No Chinese will feed a man he intends to kill . Anyway , murder was too simple : they did n't want a corpse , they wanted a victim . " Money ? You want money ? I get you big money ! " I shouted at the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my timid heckling . Grudgingly , saying " Noodoos , " banging the tin bowls down , they continued to feed me . Now and then they opened the shutters on the back window to let me empty my bucket . They did n't manhandle me  --  they did n't touch me . But they gave me no clue as to why they were holding me . Confinement was n't revenge for fellers who lingered at a murder to dig out the corpse 's eyes or cut his pecker off , and risking arrest by wasting getaway time , dance triumphantlywith it . I guessed they had kidnaped me , but if so  --  time and pain were shrouding me in the wadded gauze of sleep  --  something had gone wrong . Often I heard the Cedric start up and drive away , and each time it came back they conversed in mumbles . The Singapore police were poor at locating kidnapers . Even if the police succeeded , what rescue would that be ? It would mean my arrest on a charge of living off immoral earnings . Some friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towkays and their childrenlived in fear of kidnapers ; they were often hustled awayp156at knifepoint , but they were always released unharmed after a heavy payment . Who in the world would pay for my life ? A memory ambushed my hopes . On the Allegro a feller had told me a story I remembered in the hut . A loan shark had worked on a freighter with him . He called the feller a loan shark , but his description of the feller 's loans made them sound like charity of the most generous and reckless kind , and eventually everyone on the ship owed him money , including the skipper . One day at sea the loan shark disappeared , just like that . " We never found him , " said the feller on the Allegro , and his wink told me no one had ever looked . The remembrance scared me and made me desolate , and I believed I would stay that way , in the misery that squeezes out holy promises . But that loneliness was electrified to terrorthe day my Chinese captors had a loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their mutters , in the regular arrivals of meals and in the comings and goings of the Cedric ; and I had begun to pass the time by reciting my letters of glad news and my litany , Sir Jack , President Flowers , King John , Bishop Flowers . I drew comfort from the predictable noises of my captors and their car . My comfort ended with the arguing  --  that day they did n't bring me food . I heard it all . The dwarf 's name was Toh . He fretted in a high childish voice ; the others bow-wowed monotonously . I listened at a crack in the wall , as my empty stomach scolded me and the argument outside grew into a fight . It had to concern my fate  --  those whinnyings of incredulity and snufflinggrunts , smashings and bangings , and Toh 's querulousnessrising to an impressively sustained screeching . Then it was over . That night they put the bed back into my room , but I was so hungry and disturbed I could n't sleep . I was drowsy hours later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dazzle of the sun through the door warmed my face . I started to rise , to swing my feet off the bed . " You stay , " said Toh.  |p157Two  fellers began tying me up . " What 's the big idea ? " I said . " You want money ? I get you money . Hey , not so tight ! " I considered a fistfight , working myself into a fury sufficient to beat them off and then making a run for it . I decided against it . Any rashness would be fatal for me . They were small , but there were four of them , and now I looked up and saw a fifth . I had survived so far by staying passive ; I was sensibleenough to prefer prison to death  --  to surrender anythingbut my life . Something else stopped me : I was in my underwear and socks  --  they had taken my shoes . I would n't get far . If I had been dressed I might have taken a chance , but seminaked I felt particularly vulnerable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ankles to the end of the bed , and then put ropes around my wrists and made me fold my arms across my chest . I was in a mummy posture , bound tightly to the bed . The fifth man was behind me . I rolled my eyes back and saw that he was stropping a straight razor , whipping it up and down on a smacking tongue of leather . " Who 's he ? " Numbness throttled my pecker . Toh was checking the knots , hooking a finger on them and pulling . Smick-smack , went the razor on the strop . Toh pushed at my arms , and satisfied they were tight , said , " That Ho Khan . " " Just tell me one thing , " I said in a pitifully unfamiliarvoice . " Are you going to kill me ? Tell me  --  please . " Toh looked surprised . " No , " he said , " we not kill you . " " Why the razor ? " " Shave , " he said . The other fellers erupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed to see them . It was impossible . I could n't move . " You 're trying to scare me , are n't you ? " I heard smicksmack-smuck . Toh leaned over and nodded , smiling . His dwarf 's facep158made the smile impish . " Scare you , " he said , " and scare udda peoples , too . " " What do you mean by that ? " Smuck-smuck . " Come on , this is silly . I 'm an American , you know . I am ! The Americanconsulate is looking for me ! " " Mei-guo ren , " someone said , " an American . " Another replied in Chinese , and there was laughter . " Now I give you but , " said Toh . He scrubbed the backs of my arms with a soapy cloth . The others leaned over for a good look . One was holding a bowl , eating noodles as he watched , gobbling them in an impatient greedy way , smackinghis lips and snapping at the noodles like a cat , not chewing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gave me hope . No one would eat that way in the presence of a personabout to be slashed . Ho Khan fussed with the razor . He braced his elbows , one against my throat , one on my stomach ; and then , scrapingslowly , shaved the hairy parts of my arms that Toh had soaped , from my elbow to the rope at my wrists . To my reliefhe put the razor aside . My relief lasted seconds . Ho Khan fitted a pair of wire glasses over his eyes and took a dart-shaped silver tool which he dipped into a bottle of blue liquid . He leaned on me again and with the speed of a sewing machine began jabbingthe needle into the fleshy part of my arm . He was tattooingme  --  biting on his tongue in concentration  --  and behind him the others shouted , bursts of Chinese , seeming to tell him what to write in the punctures.  |p159AT  NEWTON CIRCUS , by the canal , they pushed me out of the car and sped away , yelling . I found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enough for a pack of cheroots and a meal of mutton chops at a Malay gag stand on the corner . I was grateful for the night , and glad too for the incuriousness of the Chinese who wolfed food noisily at tables all around me and did n't once look at me . My arms appalled me ; I examined them in the light of the stall 's hissing pressurelamp . The shaven backs of my arms were swollen and raw , the fresh punctures tracking up and down from elbow to wrist , the small half-exploded squares of Chinese characters , perhaps fifty boxes puffed up and blue and some still leaking blood . I felt better after a meal and a smoke , and left , swinging my arms , so that no one could see their disfigurement , down the canal path , past the orphanage , in the direction of Dunroamin . I smelled the acrid wood smoke , the stink of violence , before I saw the damage ; the strength of it , at that distance , telegraphed destruction . The house was gutted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted the two stucco roof peaks , the gaping windows , the broken and burned verandahp160chicks . The abandoned black house looked like an old desertedfactory ; the fire had silenced the insects and killed the perfume of my flowering trees . No crickets chirped in the compound , a smell of burning hung in the still air . Torn mattresses were twisted and humped all over the driveway and lawn . I was about to go away when , feeling the fatigue and pause of melancholy , I decided that I would enter the house , to try to find something in the ruins that belonged to me , anything portable I could recognize to claim as a souvenir , maybe a scorched clock or the German metronome Mr. Weerakoon kept in a cupboard drawer : There 's an interestingstory behind this little thing . . . I stumbled in the driveway , and stumbling felt like an intruder . Stepping over the splintered front door , I passed through the bar . Broken glass littered the floor . I balanced on fallen timbers , tiptoed into the music room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire had made , not wanting to go upstairs to see what had happened to my cats . The staring shadowsof the overturned chairs stopped me . I could feel the tattoos aching on my arms . Then I saw the candle burning in the kitchen , and near it a crouching man , his face lighted by the yellow flame . The eeriest thing about him , this old scarecrow in the burned-out house , was that he was imperturbably reading a folded newspaper . I would leave him in peace . I started toward the front door and kicked a loose board with my first step . Bang . The candle flame flickered and went out . " Do n't worry , " I called to him . " I 'm not going to hurt you. , , I made my way into the kitchen , found the candle and lit it . The old man had run to the wall where a blanket was spread . He was Chinese and had the look of a trishaw driver , the black sinewy legs and arms , close-cropped hair , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket and shorts , and on his feet were rubber clogs cut from tires.  | " You know me , eh ? Me Jack . " I laughed . " This my house ! " In that dark smelly place every sound was weird and my laugh was ghoulish . " You want smoke ? " I threw him a cheroot . He cowered when I brought the candle over for him to light it . " Me Jack , " I said . " This my house  --  Dunroamin . " He blinked . " You house ? " " Yeah , " I said . " All finished now . " He cackled and said something I could n't make out . " You live here now ? " I asked . " Sleep here , eat here  --  makan here , eh ? " " Makan , makan , " he said , and picked up a small bowl . He offered it to me . " You makan . " There were lumps of rice inside , with two yellow pork rinds on top of the rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the rinds . It was a sharing gesture and it worked . The poor man was calmed . He went to a tin lunch pail and spooned some more rice into the bowl . " No , " I said . " Makan , " he said , and smiled . I took the bowl and ate a few grains , chewing slowly . I pointed to the newspaper . " You read , eh ? Sin Chew Jit Poh ? " Naming the paper was like conversation . I thought of another . " Nanyang Siang Pau , eh ? " He nodded eagerly and handed me the paper . I put the bowl down and unfolded the paper , looked at it , said , " Yes , yes , " and gave it back . He did n't respond . He was looking at my arms . He put a skinny finger on one row of tattoos , and tapping each character , worked his way down , tracing the vertical column . He frowned and tapped at another column , but faster now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I grinned . He backed away , holding an outstretched palm up to ward me off ; he groaned distinctly , and he ran , kicking over the tinp162lunch pail , and tramping the broken boards of the music room , and howling down the drive . That night I slept on the old man 's blanket and breathed the fumes from his crudded lunch pail . " Curse of Dogshit , " said Mr. Tan , translating in the Bandungthe next day . He read my left arm . " Beware Devil , Whore 's Boy , Mouth Full of Lies , Remove This and Die . Very nasty , " said Mr. Tan . " Let me see your other arm . " The right said , Red Goatface , Forbidden Ape , Ten Devils in One , I Am Poison and Death , Remove This and Die . After that , Mr. Tan was included in the conversations Yardley had with the others when my tattoos were mentioned . For years , Mr. Tan had sat every afternoon alone with his bottle of soybean milk . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he called upon Mr. Tan to repeat them . " Incredible , " Yardley said . " There , what about that one ? " " Forbidden Ape , " said Mr. Tan promptly . " Can you imagine , " said Yardley . " And that one  --  ' Monkey'sArse ' or something like that ? " " Dogshit , " said Mr. Tan . " All right , " I said . " That 's enough . " " Remember old Baldwin , the chap that worked for Jardine ? " asked Smale . " He had tattoos all over the place . Birds and that . " " You going to keep them , Jack ? " asked Coony . " Souvenir of Singapore . Show ' em to your mum . " " You think it 's a joke . " I said . " These things hurt . And the doctor says I have to wait till they heal before I can get them off . " " You 'll never get them buggers off , " said Yardley . " The doctor says  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Acid , " said Yates . " They burn them off with acid . I readp163about this somewhere . It leaves scars  --  that 's the only snag . But scars are infinitely preferable to what you 've got there , if you ask me . " " Maybe they used some kind of Chinese ink , " said Coony . " You know , the kind that never comes off . " " Balls ! " said Smale . " If it was Chinese ink he 'd be able to wash the flaming things off with soap and water . No , that there 's your regular tattooing ink . You can tell . " " Monkey 's Arse , " said Yardley , laughing . " Christ , be glad it 's not in English ! What if it was and Jack was in London , on a bus or something ? Fares please , ' the conductor says and looks over and sees Monkey 's Arse , Pig Shit , and all that on Jack 's arm . " " He 'd probably ride free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better one , " said Smale . " Let 's say Jack 's in church and the vicar 's just given a little sermon on foul language . The lady next to Jack looks down and  --  " " Lay off , " I said , rolling down my sleeves to cover the scabrous notations . " How would you like it if they did it to you ? " " No bloody fear , " said Coony . " If one of them little bastards  --  " " Shut up , " said Yardley . " They 'd tattoo the same thing on your knackers before you could say boo . " Yardley turned to me and said , " Do n't get upset , Jacko . They got ways of gettingthat stuff off . But I 'll tell you one thing  --  you 'd be a fool to try it again . " " What are you talking about ? " " That whorehouse of yours , " said Yardley . " You were asking for it . Any of us could have told you that . Right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you 're saying I deserved it . " " What do you think ? " I said , " I was making a few bucks . " " Where is it now ? " Yardley nudged Frogget.
