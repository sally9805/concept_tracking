txt ERNIE KOVACS did n't look much like a comedian . He was a large man with a rather unsavory mustache . He tauten witti a heavy tongue and smoked fat cigars . He looked more like a garment manufacturer . But he was not only a comedian , he was that rarest of things : a genius . I say that knowing the word has been Close-up With Jeff Lyon cheapened of late . Everybody has become a genius . You hear it all the time . The genius of Buddy Holly . The genius of Vince Lombardi . Well probably be talking about the genius of Sam Popeil soon . 1 mean Ernie Kovacs was a genius . In the traditional , creative , unique way . NOW YOU MAY ask why I 'm writing about Ernie Kovacs . I 'm doing so to give people ample time to clear off some Tuesday nights this spring to watch five hours of vintage Kovacs . The Public Broadcasting System has purchased the rights to the videotapes and kinescopes of the late comedian 's old television shows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending hours culling through it all and retaping and stringing together what he thinks is the best , and most representative , of Kovacs ' humor . AND WHEN HE 'S done , Erdman , who is also associate producer and director of Channel 11 's Soundstage series , will have put together 10 half-hour shows . They will be aired over the PBS network each Tuesday night , beginning April 12 . Fun if you remember Ernie Kovacs , like I do . And fun if you do n't . Ernie Kovacs It 's been a long time since he died . January of 1902 , to be exact . He was 42 , and just reaching the peak of his career . when his speeding station wagon skidded into a lightpole as he returned home in the rain from a Beverly Hills party . He left a legacy far greater than the tapes , which his widow , actress Edic // =MI From page one Get ready for return of Mr. Kovacs // Adams , has kept in storage all these years . Ile left a brand of original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamelessly . Richard Lester picked it up when he directed the Beatles ' movies . Rowan and Martin used it when they did Laugh-In . The NotReady-For-Prime-Time players do a form of it each week on Saturday Night Live . .. IT IS A KIND of humor they used to call zany , or madcap , a venture into the incongruous and visually unexpected . At the least it is bizarre , and at the most it is controlled schizophrenia . What else can one say , for example , about something like Kovacs ' Nairobi Trio . Reduced to its basics , it is three stringy-haired apes in greatcoats and derbies , one playing piano , one the xylophone , and one waving a baton , to the tune of a solfeggio . At the end of each chorus , the ape with the baton gets struck on his derby by the xylophone player . I ca n't explain why , but it is perhaps the funniest comedy routine ever put on television . And it is by far Kovacs ' most famous . The Nairobi Trio will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' favorites like the effeminate poet Percy Dovetonsils and the blackout scenes with the Threepenny Opera background music . ERDN1AN SAYS eight of the programs will be spliced " potpourris " of various shows . Two shows will be virtually uncut and as ho made them for the American Broadcasting Co . One is the last show he made , which was Close-up aired posthumously . And one is entirely without dialogue , and features the Kovacs character Eugene , a Chaplinesque bumpkin in squishy tennis shoes who invades an exclusive men 's club . As Eugene walks past Rodin 's statue , the Thinker , he hears humming . As he walks past The Lovers , he hears panting . In the club library he opens the book " Camille " and a hacking cough comes out . Recently I watched the first show that Erdman had completed . As . the Kovacs theme song , Oriental Blues , began playing I was catapulted back 20 years . IT STARTED off with the blaelcouts . A bathtub empties , as a hand sticking out of the drain clings desperately before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda straw while the glass fills , rather than empties . A person goes into a darkroom and comes out as a negative image . There is a six-second routine of a used car dealer tapping the roof of an auto , causing the car to fall through the pavement . Kovacs , whose lack of concern for money was legendary , spent $13,000 on this one brief scene . People break eggs and celery to the 1812 Overture . A 50-foot cowboy squashes a ranch house . And , in a German ' western concocted by Kovacs , the cowboys all wear lederhosen . At one point in the German western , the villain walks on the scene , and a trembling townsman gasps " Schwartze Bartel " Which translates to " Black Bart ! " ERDMAN HAS been scrupulous In not cut ? ting any of the routines down . This was a condition requested by Miss Adams , but it does create a small problem . Kovacs ' humor was slow-paced , even by 1050s standards . By today 's standards , it can drag . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff , " Erdman says . " He has n't changed . but we have . I find that to watch this I have to wind down , to settle back and relax . It is n't ha ha anymore , it 's a chuckle . It is gentle and bizarre , and very far ahead of its time . " That must he remembered . Kovacs was doing avante-garde satire while Milton Berle was still hitting people with a pig bladder . " I think the world is ready for Ernie again , " Miss Adams says . " We 've been through the ' 60s . We 've been rebels , . and now we 've gone full circle . Ernie 's point of view was to take a potshot at anyone who took himself too seriously . " DE WAS A MOODY . lovable Hungarian , as funny off the stage as on , she recalls . Ile was crazy and impulsive , like when he spent his life savings on an expensive sports car for their second date because he did n't want to take her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius . " It was a raw genius , " Miss Adams says , " that sort of subconscious kind that just comes straight out . Ernie had three bizarre things in the back of his head and he just sort of reported them . " Stay tuned .
