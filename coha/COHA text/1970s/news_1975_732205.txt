txt Several members of the Senate Banking Committee said Friday that William Proxmire , the panel 's chairman , probably had the hare minimum of votes to bring to the senate floor a bill that would save New ' York City from default . Nevertheless , he was unable to avert a postponement of committee action until next week . " It appears that Prox has the votes to get a loan guarantee bill out of committee , " Sen. Robert Packwood R. , Oro.J , who opposes the legislation , said after a 31/2-hour bill-drafting session , Some Democratic supporters of the measure privately agreed with Pack-wood 's assessment , but noted that many of those votes would be made without enthusiasm merely to accommodate the chairman and enable the bill to reach the floor . They hoped that the four-day postponment would give Proxmire an opportunity to enlarge his majority of one , and thereby increase its support . SEN . EDWARD Brooke R. , Mass. , who also opposes the legislation , told the committee that " to rush this legislation on the floor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long run . " He said after the session that if the 7-to-8 majority could be enlarged to 8-to-5 , " it would be a better situation . " " I could n't vote for it at this particular time , but I may well be able to vote for it later , after we 've reviewed all the options , " Brooke said . The committee members regarded the key vote as the one belonging to Sen. Stevenson D. , who voted with the 7-6 majority to consider the loan guarantee legislation . Since then , however , although not ruling out such legislation , he has said that ho favors restructuring New York City 's debt , THERE WERE ludications that Stevenson 's defection from the loan guarantee proposal would be balanced by the support of Sen. Robert Morgan ID. , N. C. , who voted against considering the legislation but gave Proxmire his proxy " for procedural purposes . " " I do n't know what I 'm going to do , " Morgan , who had previously expressed criticism of the loan , guarantee program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " I want to help New York  --  the question is how . The uncertainty must be ended . One thing that we can not do is nothing . The result of a default and nothing more would be calamitous . " He added , " One thing that must be done is to restructure the debt of the city of New York , which now exceeds $14 billion . " Stevenson noted that the smallest obligations issued by the city were for $10,000 and asked , " Now , who are we bailing out , poor widows and orphans ? " Sen. Jacob Javits R. , N.Y. shedding his earlier optimism , said the chance of congressional help is " grim . " He called for changes in the law to ticcommodate a city bankruptcy and " avoid absolute anarchy in New York City . " Javits , at a news conference , said , " We must insist on some legal instrument which would enable the city to survive a default . " UNABLE SINCE March to sell bonds to pay debts as they became due , New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The city owes $12.3 billion . Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur Burns advised Congress Thursday to let the city go into default and to alter the bankruptcy laws so that payment of interest and principle on debts could be suspended with repayment later stretched out at lower interest rates . The city 's operations could be placed under a court 's supervision . " WHAT I SAY to sea . Buckley is , ' Okay , do anything you want about these matters , but let 's have a little care about the timing so it does n't abort any effort we 're making here to get absolutely indispensable ! credal help , " Javits said .
