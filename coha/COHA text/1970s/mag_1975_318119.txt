THE EVENING COLONNADE by CYRIL CONNOLLY 469 pages . Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. $15 . <P> <P> Your leather-bound classics with the cut India-leaf pages are hopelessly water-stained-those that did not sink on the coral reef coming in . And so the hypothetical question has become not what one Great Book but what one Great Reader would you want to be shipwrecked with on a desert island . For the past four decades , the right answer for the literate Robinson Crusoe has been Cyril Connolly , who died last November at the age of 70 . <P> He was the author of one witty novel ( The Rock Pool ) and a rather indescribable , rather marvelous volume of quotations , moody autobiography and black-Irish philosophy he called The Unquiet Grave . But by temperament and profession he was above all that obsolescent specimen , The Bookman . The bulk of his writing , like this last collection , was in the form of reviews . Posed against a floor-to-ceiling bookcase with his snub-nose schoolboy 's impertinent face , he seemed as much in his natural habitat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other critic , with the possible exception of Edmund Wilson , was so persuasive in coaxing readers to rush out and buy the book he himself had just read . But while Wilson made his readers feel it was their duty as civilized men , Connolly made any recommendation look like a pleasure no hedonist could afford to miss . <P> Pressed Flower . The son of an avid shell collector , Connolly had a passion for classifying . He invented categories of style-for instance , mandarin ( Samuel Johnson , Henry James , and all those who do n't write as they talk , including , of course , Connolly ) . His lifetime hobby was drawing up lists of those who made literature what it is today , culminating in that half book , half catalogue , The Modern Movement . Connolly loved the sweeping judgment : " The greatest single poem of the first half of the twentieth century . . . " turns out to be the Four Quartets . " If there is one key book of the twentieth century . . . " -a clause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But despite all those reviews in the Observer and then the Sunday Times of London , he was not primarily a critic . He was always being something less or something more : a gossip , an anecdotist or , more often , an essayist . Here he is , taking off from the Gide-Paul Valery letters : " Letters are most alive when freshly delivered in the sender 's handwriting , something perishes when they are typed , more when they are printed , most of all when they are translated . Finally we are left with a well-pressed flower from the original blossom , a silent film of a lifelong tennis match without the sound of the rallies , the oaths and the endearments . "
