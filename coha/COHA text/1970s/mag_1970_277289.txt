There is a backlash built into every expos , witness the case of Don Luce , 36 , a U.S. correspondent in Viet Nam . Last spring Luce ( no kin to TIME 'S founder ) discovered political prisoners of the Vietnamese government locked into underground " tiger cages " that were being maintained by American dollars supporting the Vietnamese penal system . Luce told visiting Democratic Congressmen William R. Anderson and Augustus F. Hawkins , then escorted them on a tour of the cages , during which Congressional Aide Tom Harkin snapped a number of damning pictures . The Congressmen broke the story , and Luce supplied material for a pictorial essay in LIFE , creating considerable embarrassment for the Vietnamese government and the U.S. embassy in Saigon . He also wrote pieces for the Manchester Guardian and some Vietnamese papers . <P> The director of the Vietnamese press center , Nguyen Ngoc Huyen , has now told Luce that his press card will not be renewed . Huyen admitted to other correspondents that the reason was the tiger-cage story . The pro-government Saigon Post , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gods have finally caught up with Don Luce . This man was more dangerous to Viet Nam than a Stokely Carmichael . So we must kick him out , and any others like him . " <P> Don Luce is to the South Vietnamese government what Ralph Nader is to General Motors . An agricultural specialist who went to Viet Nam in 1958 for International Voluntary Services , Luce speaks Vietnamese fluently , knows the culture and people better than virtually any correspondent or U.S. Government employee . That may be the problem . Luce feels he witnessed wholesale indifference to the fate of the Vietnamese people . When his Vietnamese workers on one agricultural program were deprived of six months ' pay by a Vietnamese provincial administrator , he was told by U.S. and Vietnamese officials it was none of his affair . When an entire island was defoliated by U.S. planes , Luce asked $10,000 restitution for lost crops . A U.S. official told him : " The whole damn country is not worth $10,000 . " He switched to journalism in 1967 , and ever since , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the damage of the Viet Nam War to the ordinary citizens . Popular with the Vietnamese he lived and worked with , Luce now finds that many of his old friends have stopped visiting him for fear they will be followed . <P> In the past , American journalists have usually been saved from losing their press cards by zero-hour rescues from the American embassy . So far , no such aid has been offered to Luce .
