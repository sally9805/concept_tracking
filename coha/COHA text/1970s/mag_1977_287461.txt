" Hssst ! " hissed the minked Westchester matron to a furbelowed companion at New York 's Grand Central Terminal . " Come with me . I know a place that has earmuffs ! " <P> Good luck ! Bonne chance ! Happy hunting ! <P> Among other items in nationwide short supply and fierce demand in this killing winter are woolen underwear , blankets ( wool and electric ) , flannel shirts , wool socks , parkas , mittens , gloves , mufflers , ski pants , goggles , hand warmers , car batteries , weather stripping , calking guns , firewood , woodburning stoves , electric heaters , and radios with the weather band that tells you how frightful today is going to be . <P> Yet another item in short supply is old-fashioned common sense . Herewith TIME 'S all-purpose , endless-winter survival guide , as composed by Senior Writer Michael Demarest : <P> CODDLE YOURSELF . Frostbite , associated in the popular mind with polar explorers and Everest ascenders , is a real and insidious danger whenever it is freezing outside . Just ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of noses and ungloved fingers . Smoking increases the risk , since nicotine constricts blood vessels , hastening the cooling process . Nor should one drink alcohol before venturing outside . Booze opens up the blood vessels and accelerates heat loss from the body . <P> The first symptom of frostbite is a tingling sensation in the extremities . The skin turns slightly red at first and then becomes pale grayish-yellow and numb . Pain subsides and sometimes blisters begin to appear . At the first signs , the victim should be brought inside and the affected parts warmed with tepid , not hot water . Snow should never be massaged on a frostbitten area . Second-and third-degree frostbites are treated like burns ; sometimes victims are hospitalized . Thus it is only commonsensical to suit up for winter as if it were a mortal foe-which it can be ( see box following page ) . <P> CODDLE YOUR CAR . Cars get the blahs , just as people do in the cruelest months . The battery is the auto 's tenderest part : in freezing temperatures , it loses up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the car should be garaged at night , with a blanket over the hood or a warming watch light hung inside . To keep the battery charged , the driver should stay in second gear for as long as possible at speeds under 50 m.p.h. ; when the car is in high gear , the generator does not produce enough energy to beef up the down-drawn cells . Never try to start the car when any accessories - heater , radio , windshield wipers-are turned on . Keep an aerosol can of ether in the car . You may not have to use it to fight off bears or buffaloes , but it can be a useful way to whiff alive a cold , dank motor . <P> EAT HEARTY . The metabolism works overtime when the body is exposed to cold . As the human 's heat pump , the body has to be fueled-with food . In Maine logging camps , a typical meal consists of vegetable soup , baked beans , bread and jam , macaroni and cheese , ground-beef casserole , pancakes , spaghetti and meatballs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . Somewhat more delicately , Julia Child girds for winter with bean soup , enriched with leftover beef or lamb stew or whatever , and home-baked bread . And long johns .
