Bowie Kuhn , Commissioner of Baseball , must dream about Septembers like this . All too often the coming of crisp evenings means limp competition - pennant races already decided , games being played for the sake of the schedule . Last week , for a change , there were tight races in three of the four major league divisions , providing more drama than any September has seen since baseball expanded in 1969 . <P> Adding to the pennant excitement , St. Louis Cardinal Leftfielder Lou Brock was on the verge of shattering one of baseball 's most celebrated records : Maury Wills ' mark of 104 stolen bases in a single season . Finally , at least half the teams still in contention were there because young , relatively obscure players have suddenly become stars . <P> Only a month ago , the season seemed dull . With the exception of the Eastern Division of the National League , where St. Louis and Philadelphia were battling for the lead , all was quiet on the first-place front . Then the balance abruptly began to shift . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the story in this race focused on Lou Brock and Philadelphia 's third baseman Mike Schmidt . Brock was making headlines with his running , but he was also winning games by being in scoring position on second after his steals . Schmidt , who hit .196 as a rookie last year , boosted himself and the Phillies this season by leading the league in home runs and RBIs through the end of August . <P> As summer waned , though , Pittsburgh Pirate Slugger Willie Stargell announced that " the race does n't start until September 1 . " A week before Stargell 's target date , the rapidly improving Pirates took over first place . Leading the charge has been Richie Zisk , not exactly a household name among ball fans . Until this year the Brooklyn-born rightfielder was best known as a dreamer . " He 'd stand out in the field and think about a movie he 'd seen , " recalls Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh . Going into last weekend , the former woolgathering champ was hitting .325 , second best in the league . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are headed for a showdown series next week . <P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE WEST <P> No one could blame the Dodgers last week if they had a frightening sense of dj vu . Just a year after they had fallen apart in the second half of the sea son , the Dodgers seemed ready for a repeat performance . Their 10-game lead earlier this year had dwindled to a margin of 2 , and they still had six games with the surging Reds . <P> Even so , prospects for the Dodgers were hardly hopeless . Though the Los Angeles lineup lacks big-name bats like Cincinnati 's Pete Rose , Joe Morgan and Johnny Bench , the Dodgers have their share of potent hitters . First Baseman Steve Garvey , who was the Dodgers ' bat boy 15 years ago , sports a healthy batting average of .324 , followed not far behind by young Leftfielder Bill Buckner . Jim Wynn , the " Toy Cannon , " adds the power of 30 home runs and 99 RBis . And there is always iron-arm Mike Marshall in the bullpen . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
