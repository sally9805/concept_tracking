The business of regulating business is one of the fastest-growing areas of government . It is also fast becoming one of the most criticized , even though nobody denies the need for some regulation or the benefits of clean air , pure water , safe products , healthy workers and employed minorities . An alliance of liberals and conservatives now protest that regulation is excessive and the benefits are not worth the price . They have found an ally in Jimmy Carter , who promises to battle regulatory excess as part of his Stage II anti-inflation plan . And not a moment too soon . " Our regulatory system , " asserts Assistant Commerce Secretary Jerry Jasinowski , " is out of control . " <P> America 's regulatory history dates back to the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission 91 years ago , and big growth came during the New Deal , when such agencies as the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission were started . But most of the excesses that are drawing fire were born in the mid-1960s and early 1970s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a large number of new bureaus were formed , including the Environmental Protection Agency , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission . <P> Certainly , reformers do not want an end to all regulation . But most agree that many of the pre-1960s agencies have outlived much of their usefulness and that their rules , once necessary to curtail the old robber barons , now work to inhibit natural competition and accelerate inflation . These agencies do little if anything to improve the quality of life , and deregulation , as proved by the CAB 'S move to free air fares and the SEC 's loosening of brokers ' commission rates , can quickly and dramatically cut prices . <P> Where newer agencies like the EPA and OSHA are concerned , even the most ardent deregulators want some rules to remain , admitting that it is impossible to put a dollar price on social welfare . But at the same time they argue that there are now too many silly , contradictory and ineffective rules that snarl enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to identify and enact sensible changes that would allow regulation to achieve much the same social goals in a less wasteful way and with a much smaller damage to other , equally important economic goals , including job-creation . <P> Often the newer agencies are headed by enthusiasts who see a mission to push new rules without regard to price . As a result , they have made little attempt to apply the most elementary cost-benefit analyses . Cheaper solutions that could achieve the same ends or almost the same ends have been ignored in favor of overkill . America has just not got value for money from its red-tape spending spree . <P> The full costs of federal regulation are difficult to determine and open to bitter dispute . One of the most widely accepted estimates has been made by Economist Murray Weidenbaum , head of the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University . He divides the costs into two categories . The first is administrative costs , which consist of visible federal spending on regulatory agencies . These have rocketed from $745 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is , it only hints at the real burden .
