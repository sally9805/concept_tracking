85 films and 21 plays later , Henry Fonda is still working <P> He has been acting for 53 years . With a half-century 's experience behind him it should seem natural for Henry Fonda to play an old man . But at 73 the old pro has to work at acting his age . He resolutely puts on a stoop and shuffle as he portrays an aged Supreme Court Justice in his 21st play , First Monday in October , which opens on Broadway this week . Yet the man 's youthfulness is what lingers in the mind . In his comic turns , Fonda remains as lean and lithe as when he came to national attention in The Farmer Takes a Wife . Watching the star , audiences find it difficult to remember that Jane Fonda is 40 , that Peter Fonda turned 38 this year . Some four decades after his film debut , Henry Fonda still can not help suggesting younger men - like the young Mr. Lincoln , or Mr. Roberts . <P> Not that Fonda consciously tries recreation . All the long parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physique and casting . " I 've just got the Fonda bones , " he says , " tall and skinny . " Still , some of his most memorable characters were created when those bones played against type-the magnificently klutzy dope in The Lady Eve , the martinet in Fort Apache , the scruffy bandit leader in Once Upon the Time in the West . But , as he admits , the image that has sustained his career is of the man with strained conscience , like the reluctant hero of The Ox-Bow Incident or of 12 Angry Men . " I guess I go overboard to avoid taking credit for the image I have , " says Fonda . " That way it 's easier to live with myself . I do n't feel I 'm totally a man of integrity . " He pauses thoughtfully , in the classic Fonda manner , and adds : " But if there is something in the eyes , a kind of honesty in the face , then I guess you could say that 's the man I 'd like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , his self-definition turns out to be much simpler than that . Above all , he insists , " I 'm an actor . " The kind of actor , he omits to add , whose professional life is paralleled only by a handful of great British stars with full freedom to go where the roles are and no concern about the size of the part . " It 's easier to move back and forth between the theater and films in England , " Fonda feels , " where everything is in one place . Here film and theater are separated by the width of the continent , and it 's not easy to uproot children from school , mothers and wives from homes to live in a hotel . I 've done a lot of theater because I want to . If I 'm away from it for a while I miss the audience contact , and even more the joy of creating something from start to finish . Film is still a director 's medium . " <P> Not that Fonda turns his back on his movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not full roles , that he relishes . Director John Ford , for whom he worked seven times , was a major influence : " If there is a style that emerged from that group of actors who worked repeatedly with Ford , it was a certain spareness . You learned to rein in your emotions . If they 're there , they are going to color your voice , show in your face , the way you move . "
