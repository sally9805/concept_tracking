Mortgage money , like the middle class , has long been moving out of the cities and into the suburbs , where houses are newer , incomes higher and lending risks lower . Abetting this migration is a decades-old practice called " redlining , " by which lending institutions map older city districts off limits for loans , mortgages and insurance . Would-be property buyers in redlined territory are denied loans regardless of their income or credit rating , and older city neighbor hoods quickly turn into newer slums . <P> Now a spirited fight against redlining is mounting across the U.S. by the residents of declining neighborhoods . Their tactic : to make investments in the inner city financially attractive to lenders once again , a process that community groups call " greenlining . " <P> On Milwaukee 's slightly shabby West Side , some 90 neighborhood clubs , schools and religious organizations recently formed the West Side Action Coalition , solicited pledges for $1.25 million , then offered to deposit the money in two friendly savings and loan companies ; the S &; Ls have promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Paul , giant Midwest Federal Savings &; Loan Association , responding to similar appeals , has agreed to increase its central-city loans from $19 million to $85 million this year . In Boston last month , citizen groups and local banks formed Neighborhood Housing Services , Inc. to secure loans for rehabilitating houses in two blue-collar sections of Dorchester and Roxbury . <P> Greenlining 's greatest success so far has been achieved in Chicago 's South Shore area , onetime haven of the city 's white elite , now home for a black mostly working-class population . After losing $36 million in deposits within five years , the South Shore National Bank was considering relocating its headquarters - and assets - outside the community . <P> With financial support from private foundations , the Episcopal Church and United Church of Christ , Businessman Ronald Grzywinski , 38 , bought control of the bank last August and promised to use its assets to salvage declining neighborhoods . Grzywinski and Bank President Milton Davis , 40 , have lengthened the bank 's hours , added more employees to prevent long lines at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts . This quarter , the bank will show its first gain in six years , and has an nounced plans for a development corpo ration to help save the decaying South Shore . <P> Jumping On . Public officials have begun jumping on the greenlining band wagon too . With the backing of Illinois Governor Dan Walker and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley , the Illinois state housing development authority last month announced that it will lend $20 million to state savings and loan institutions for distribution in city neighborhoods . Wisconsin Governor Patrick J. Lucey has written to lenders in Milwaukee County condemning redlining . The Federal Home Loan Bank Board , over seer of all federally chartered savings and loan associations , recently outlawed any geographic distribution of loans that discriminates against minority groups .
