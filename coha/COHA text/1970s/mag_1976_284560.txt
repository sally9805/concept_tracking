Irvine Co. owns an 80,000-acre ranch that makes up one-fifth of Orange County , Calif . There the company has been building houses and factories grouped into developments that are remarkably successful examples of comprehensive urban planning . It must be put up for sale , however , because the James Irvine Foundation owns the controlling interest . Under federal tax law , the foundation can not control an enterprise that aims at making a profit-and Irvine Co. not only tries to turn a profit but clears a rather tidy one . Mobil Oil Corp . offered $200 million in May , setting off a frantic bidding war . Since then , counteroffers have come from Cadillac Fairview , a Canadian land developer , and SMBH &; Z , a Detroit investment firm .

During the 1973-74 recession , while most developers were retrenching , Irvine was preparing its most ambitious project : Woodbridge , a new community with $42 million in parks , lakes and other public facilities .
