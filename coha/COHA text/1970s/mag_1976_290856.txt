" The wounds of war take time to heal , " said an Angolan government spokesman in Luanda last week . " A bit of bad blood is bound to persist . " That is quite an understatement . Nearly four months after it won the ferocious civil war for control of Angola , with the vital help of 12,000 Cuban soldiers and $300 million in Soviet military aid , Agostinho Neto 's Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) is still having trouble consolidating its control over the country , which is roughly twice the size of France . The cities , the Atlantic coastline and most of the central interior are secure , reports TIME Nairobi Bureau Chief Lee Griggs , who flew to Luanda last week to cover the political show trial of 13 whites , including two Americans , charged with mercenary activities . But officials in the capital concede that resistance continues in the oil-rich northern enclave in Cabinda and in the populous Central Highlands primarily along the Benguela railroad , which is still closed to copper exports from neighboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinda , Cuban troops have spearheaded an air and ground action against local separatists of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda ( F.L.E.C. ) and diehard remnants of the defeated National Front for the Liberation of Angola ( F.N.L.A. ) . They have apparently been successful in quieting the area-especially since Zare President Mobutu Sese Seko closed his border with Cabinda after Luanda protested that supplies were being funneled to the rebels . The rebel problem is more persistent in the south , where Cubans are also guarding the Benguela railway . Running clear across central Angola , the railway is difficult to defend against sabotage . The line has been blown up in a dozen places in recent weeks ; three locomotives have been destroyed by saboteurs of Jonas Savimbi 's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) who simply loosened rail bolts and let the trains derail by their own weight . <P> In addition to fighting continued resistance from a so-called handful of enemies , the Neto government faces huge problems in trying to rebuild war-shattered Angola . Coffee production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be only 500,000 bags this year , down from the normal 3.5 million bags . The industrial diamond concession in northeastern Angola will produce less than half its prewar output of 2 million carats this year . Internal transport is a shambles : dozens of key bridges and roads have been destroyed . Perhaps the most hopeful note for Neto is that production of crude at Gulf Oil 's refinery in Cabinda has been resumed ; the $500 million annual royalties from the facility now account for 80% of Angola 's foreign exchange earnings . <P> Peeling Paint . Because of the traffic disruption , the food-rich Central Highlands are short of flour , sugar and salt , while fresh fruit , meat and vegetables are on sale in Luanda ( pop . 400,000 ) only three days a week . Long lines form for everything from bread and cigarettes to beer and bottled cooking gas . Three of every four buses in Luanda have been sidelined for lack of spare parts , and only about 20 taxis ( of a prewar fleet of 600 ) are still operating .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
