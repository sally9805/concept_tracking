Angry gypsies are pressing to settle old scores <P> When they first appeared in Germany 500 years ago , one chronicle denounced them as an " uncouth , dirty and barbarous " people who " live like dogs and are expert at thieving and cheating . " During the Middle Ages , aristocrats out on a hunt considered them fair game , along with birds and boar . More than 400,000 of them were murdered by the Nazis in the course of the Holocaust that also claimed 6 million Jewish lives . Even today West Germany 's gypsies are openly persecuted . Says Grattan Puxon , general secretary of the Roma World Union , an international gypsy organization based in Bern , Switzerland : " We are the forgotten victims of Fascism . " <P> A race of dark-eyed , olive-skinned traders who began migrating out of India a millennium ago and still speak their own language ( a guttural tongue with Aryan roots called Romany ) , gypsies have been vilified wherever they have gone . Of the 10 million who now live outside India , roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in Western Europe and 500,000 are in the U.S. But only 50,000 gypsies are in West Germany . It is the home , they believe , of the worst prejudice against them . <P> Though studies have shown that the rate of violent and sexual crimes is lower among gypsies than among the German population as a whole , they remain marked as dangerous people , as well as chronic pickpockets and con men . Tellingly , the German name for gypsy , Zigeuner , literally means " wandering swindler . " Complains Romani Rose , a German gypsy activist : " If a sandwich is missing in the schoolroom , a gypsy child gets blamed . " <P> Attempts by gypsies to move into decent neighborhoods invariably touch off protests . Most gypsies are confined to ghettos ; in Bad Hersfeld , a town of 30,000 near the East German border , 200 gypsies live in old refugee housing that lacks hot water and indoor toilets and is so overrun by rats from a nearby garbage dump that children are not allowed out at night . In summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering salesmen and secondhand dealers , the treatment that they encounter is especially rough . Owners of almost 90% of West Germany 's campsites , claiming that the gypsies would pester vacationers by peddling their wares , have tacked up signs reading GYPSIES FORBIDDEN . Police periodically descend on camping gypsies with guard dogs and submachine guns and force them to move on . " We are the original campers , " Rose complains . " Yet now everyone can live like a gypsy in West Germany except gypsies . " <P> As part of Hitler 's drive to exterminate " inferior races , " the Nazis in 1938 established a Central Office for Combatting the Gypsy Menace , which arbitrarily classified thousands of gypsies as common criminals and sent them to concentration camps . Later , gypsies became targets of the Nazi crusade for racial purity .
