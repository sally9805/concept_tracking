There was little snow on the slopes above Aspen , Colo. , last week , but the skiers in the chic resort had plenty to take their minds off the discouragingly good weather . Down in the Pitkin County courthouse , the likes of Jack Nicholson shared a front bench with newsmen from papers as far away as London . In the back of the crowded room , spectators stood on piles of law books and craned their necks to catch a glimpse of the defendant . Claudine Longet , 34 , one of the town 's beautiful people , was on trial for shooting her ski-ace lover , Vladimir ( " Spider " ) Sabich . <P> The event , like Aspen itself , brought together the worlds of big-buck entertainment and world-class skiing . The waiflike , French-born defendant had been a lead Folies-Bergre showgirl in Las Vegas . There she met Andy Williams , the Kennedys ' favorite crooner , and ended up marrying him and his singing career . After 14 years of marriage and three children , they were divorced in 1975 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The skier , a former world pro champion , was a celebrated bon vivant who owned a $250,000 mountaintop house in Aspen . It was there , while he was washing his face , that Longet killed him on March 21 . <P> After the shooting , Longet told police that she had found a .22-cal. pistol in the house and had decided to ask Sabich how to operate it , thinking the gun would be good protection when he was away . As they talked the gun fired , hitting him in the abdomen . Murder was out , but she was indicted for " reckless manslaughter . " <P> The prosecution team , led by Levi's-clad Assistant District Attorney Ashley Anderson , 29 , based much of its claim that Longet had behaved recklessly on the testimony of Aspen Detective David Garms . He related how Longet had told him after the shooting , " I raised the gun and playfully went ' Boom , boom , ' and it went off . " Anderson also tried to establish that Longet was reckless by nature . He called Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He denied that he had told an Aspen neighbor the day after the shooting that Longet was a " crazy gal who likes to drive fast , ski fast and take chances . " <P> No Joke . For the defense , Longet - wan and wide-eyed and conservatively turned out in shirt and sweater-was her own best witness . She told the jurors that " Spider and I loved each other very much , " an assertion that contradicted local gossip that their relationship was on the skids . The word was that Sabich had ordered Longet to leave because he was tired of her jealous , inhibiting manner . Prosecutor Anderson claimed to have a witness whom Spider had bet $100 that Longet would be gone by April , but he never produced one . <P> On the stand , Longet flinched when she was handed the gun to show the jury how she had held it . Whispered Longet : " I continued walking toward him , telling him I wanted to know more about it . " Had she raised the gun " playfully " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't joke with guns .
