The remaining snags-are apparently these : ? Israel is reluctant to withdraw its forces from the west bank of the Suez Canal and from their most forward positions on the east bank of the canal without some guaranty that this will not leave the Egyptians in an advantageous position to resume hostilities . ? Egypt is reluctant to agree to any withdrawal plan which would deny it the option of resuming hostilities unless there is a cast-iron guaranty that such a plan would be only the first stage in a fairly speedy timetable for Israeli withdrawal from all Egyptian territory held by the Israelis since the six-day war of 1967 . Dr. Kissinger was back in Aswan , Egypt , Monday for the second time in three days , after visiting Israel . After conferring with Egyptian President Sadat in Aswan he was expected to fly later Monday to Israel for a second round of talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed on the principle of disengagement of their forces from the potentially explosive interlocking embrace in which last year 's October war left them astride the  --  Suez Canal and in Sinai . The basic question to be resolved is : If they disengage , what next ?
