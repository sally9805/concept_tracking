I Vespri Siciliani is the kind of work with which grand opera has frequently made a spectacle of itself , in more ways than one . Written by Giuseppe Verdi for the Paris Opera in 1855 , it had something to please every vagary of the self-indulgent French musical taste of the time-five acts , a lengthy ballet , historical fireworks , huge choruses , soulful solos . The story is set in 13th-century Palermo , where the French colonists are oppressing the Sicilian natives . Arrigo , one of the principal revolutionaries , discovers to his horror that he is the illegitimate son of the chief oppressor , Montforte . Not only does this news test his divided loyalties , but it ruins his romance with the fair Elena , who is sympathetic to the Sicilians . With loud cries of " Vendetta ! " the Sicilians overthrow Montforte at the final curtain . <P> The libretto was a piece of hack work from a Parisian scenario factory run by an enterprising auteur of sorts named Eugene Scribe . Having just successfully completed Rigoletto and La Traviata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messy French text with the passion he brought to everything . <P> Why , then , even bother with Vespri ? Why should the Metropolitan Opera , currently some $3,000,000 in debt , go to the time , trouble and expense of mounting the opera for the first time in its 90-year history ? Fair questions , which were not entirely answered by the premiere performance at Lincoln Center last week . Yet the Met 's brief for Vespri contains any number of good points . Conductor James Levine and Stage Director John Dexter eliminated a half-hour 's worth of ballet ( wisely , considering the Met 's declivity for dance ) and edited the work down to three acts , running a relatively tidy 3 hours . Then there were the principal singers : Sopra no Montserrat Caballe , Tenor Nicolai Gedda , Baritone Sherrill Milnes , Bass Justino Diaz . They constituted the kind of front-rank cast that the company does not regularly assemble these days . Nor does the Met orchestra play every day with the snap and precision that it gave Conductor Levine . <P> Old Saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music than any but scholars would have deduced from its century or so of neglect . The over ture is more or less an orchestral favor ite . The first-act aria , " O tu , Palermo , " is a recital staple for basses . What a surprise , though , to discover the power of the quartet and chorus with which Verdi concludes the second act - a moment of grand confrontation in which every body perceives everybody else 's seeming treachery . Or to find that Verdi has rarely written anything lovelier than Elena 's farewell to Arrigo , " Ah , parli a un core . " Spinning out its delicately chromatic cantilena like the mistress of cantabile that she is , Soprano Caballe stopped the show for a full two minutes and 45 seconds . The applause ceased only when Caballe held up a palm and signaled Levine to continue .
