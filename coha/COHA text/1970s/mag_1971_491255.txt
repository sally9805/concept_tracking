// This is the young lady , as almost everyone knows by now , who has personified the return of ro  --  mance in her lovely self . But no one has so been able to reach her innermost heart as this veteran interviewer of The Saturday Evening Post , whose rare insights and warmth of personality have created an art form of his own , long familiar to American readers . There is a glow in his words , the glow which has been missing for quite awhile from the magazine scene : but it is back , and he is back , and it could well be that you may never forget this moving revelation of the heart of a young actress who has stirred the emotions of the whole world . Read , then , these variations on a theme , and it is Love , by PETE MARTIN . 1 saw Love Story in a small cinema near Paoli , Pennsylvania . There were four in our party ? my wife , me , another couple our age . The crowd in the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . A girl in her teens said , " Phillip was chicken . He would n't come . He 's scared he might show he 's got feelings . " When the movie was over and people were shuffling out , we just sat there not saying any  --  thing . I looked at the teenager who 'd been stood up by Phillip . Tears made slick , silver streaks on her cheeks . But I did n't cry . Nor did any in my group . Our emotion was deeper than tears . One of us said , " It 's so beautiful . I do n't want to talk . " It took me back to the opening night of Death Of A Salesman , starring Lee J. Cobb . When that curtain went down I sat absolutely still , too . I did n't speak all the way home . Love Story is no Death Of A Salesman , but it grabbed me . All right , I 'm a sentimentalist . So what ? To me senti  --  ment is not a debased , moronic emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Love Story , used a few words I connect with a locker room or a trucker 's drive-in , but they did n't shock me . As Ali uses them on screen they 're just a way of talking , a means of com  --  munication between the young . Heard that way they are n't dirty . Last March , buying a shirt in Jacksonville , Florida , I asked a young , slim clerk if she had read or seen Love Story . She had done both . " It 's a classic , like brought up-to-date , " she said . " You know , Romeo and Juliet at Harvard . It 's so // real it was creepy . I knew how those two felt all the time . " I 'll buy that . I 'll also buy the judgment that the film is better than the book . That only makes Erich Segal 's book more of a triple phenomenon . The hard-cover version was on The New York Times best seller list for over a year , most of the time at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sion have been sold . More than 5,000,000 soft-cover copies were printed in the largest print order for any book since the invention of mov  --  able type . As a side effect , the movie 's musical score has been a recording top-seller . And seven Academy Award nominations speak for them  --  selves . To certain critics , Love Story 's most unforgivable sin is its enor  --  mous , continuing success . In the first eight weeks after it opened , the film grossed more than $28 million , an all-time record for any film . It was chosen by Queen Eliza  --  beth for honors at England 's Twen  --  ty-Fifth Royal Film Festival . Madame Pompidou selected it for similar celebration in France . This year the book has been the Number One best seller in such countries as France , Holland , Japan . Love Story 's " timing , " acci  --  dental or planned , had to be split  --  second-right to explain such tri  --  umphs . The movie-going public had become so tired of skin and sexual sloppiness , so weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so sick of bombed-out university libraries , it was thirsty for a sip of honest emotion . Almost immediate  --  ly , the first sentence of the movie ( and of the book ) began to seep into the brain pans of critics and other writers : " What can you say about a twenty-five-year-old girl who died ? " One of the first so inspired was Time magazine 's cinema critic , Ste  --  fan Kanfer . Kanfer wrote : " In an era of sexual license and X-rated sprees , it was inevitable that the hottest sentence of the hottest best seller could have been lifted from La Boh'eme . " Kanfer answered Segal 's what-can-you-say query . " You can say that All MacGraw is genuinely touching . When a Rad  --  cliffe girl chooses to die on screen , the Academy Awards can be heard softly rustling like Kleenex in the background . " In January , Life 's Loudon Wainwright used the phrase to lead off a page of restrained emotion he called Another Sort of Love Story . Wainwright 's intimate essay was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family , a dog named John Henry , to sleep . " Un  --  done by sentiment , " he confessed , " and for some wild reason remembering not Lassie but Love Story , I will risk a version of its opening ques  --  tion : ' What do you say about an I11/2-year-old dog that died ? That he was at least as beautiful as Ali MacGraw ... That he ran shining and marvel  --  ously fast through fields . . . floated burnt au  --  burn over stone walls . ' " More people wrote Wainwright to say , " Thank you " than for any  --  thing he had ever written before . Segal 's first sentence even infected a sports writer , Jim O'Brien of the New York Post . On February 8 , O'Brien began a column on the New York Knickerbockers : " What can you say about a 25-year-old basketball team when it dies ? That it was beautiful and brilliant ? That it captured the world 's championship , NBA version , as well as the hearts of New Yorkers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tug . I fought off the impulse to use any part of it , but the temptation was too strong . I thought , I 'll make mine different . I 'll put it this way . " What do you say about a 3I-year-old girl named All MacGraw who seems to be the reincarnation of that extinct species , the Hollywood Star ? " I did n't have to answer that question . Ali answered it for me . She has been interviewed many times but she is too young , too new to movie making , to have developed a " set " life story . Her husband , Para  --  mount Vice-President Bob Evans , told me , " She feels that too much has been made of her . She 's been interviewed before . However , what she 'll tell you will be different and more revealing than anything she has said previously . Her thinking is flexible . " When I walked into her Fifth Avenue suite she seemed more willowy , yet shorter , than she had been on screen . And more beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderly . Tothe left of it ( for some reason not to the right of it ) , a laughline is engraved like a parenthesis . Her voice is clear yet low pitched . There is nothing of the acting school about her . My son , who knows her , told me , " She 's a lot like Sara Breckenridge and Jane Perkins . Father . " They are two intelli  --  gent , idealistic upper middle class girls he recalls from his days at prep school and at Dartmouth . There were flowers on the table and a pot of hot coffee waiting . Books were stacked around the room ; I caught a glimpse of Future Shock and an anthology of F. Scott Fitzgerald novels . Ali 's son Joshua , born a few weeks after Love Story opened , slept two rooms away . My son had told me that she was a very private person , but that did not mean she was shy . We talked about an expose-style article about her husband that had appeared in a national magazine a few years be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person in that article is not the person know . So I find it very scary when you read about someone , because then you suddenly decide that 's who they are . I think the important thing always is meeting the person ; only the village idiot will base his judgment of people only on what he reads about them . You ca n't judge people by the clothes they have , by the house they live in , by any of that stuff . " Still , she said later , it was a photograph that led to her first ( and only other ) film . Goodbye Columbus . " It was taken in the early 1960s , when I was working in New York for a fashion photo  --  grapher . An agent saw it , and ask  --  ed : ' Would you like me to represent you getting into films ? ' I said , ' I do n't know . I 'm not an actress . I have a job . I could n't take time off to wander around . 1 can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a lunch hour . It does n't sound very practical , but if it ever works out it sounds as if it would be fun . ' Frankly , I never thought it would . So it was really a luck thing when first Goodbye Columbus came up . " The agent sent me to meet Stanley Jaffe , Paramount 's presi  --  dent , and Larry Peerce , the pie s ture 's director , and I thought this was kind of crazy because the girl 's part in Columbus was a compli  --  cated part and I 'd had no acting experience . But Stanley and Larry Peerce and Paramount were willing to use an unknown . Me . That 's the luck part . It took a lot of guts for Stanley and Larry.1 mean they could have waked up with a horror on their hands and suddenly have to recast in the middle of a $10,000 shooting day . " They did n't , of course , and the result is his  --  tory : a hit for Paramount , and stardom for Ali MacGraw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actress is a funny thing , " she said . " A girl is really on slippery ground there , because you do n't know from one picture to the next whether you can work satisfactorily again . But I 've got one thing going for me that gives me strength . I 'm tremendously proud , and I like to be good at what I do . I have a great respect for being a pro at anything you really care about . " It annoyed me when one critic wrote , ' She did n't have to act in Goodbye Columbus , just be herself . ' I resented that because Brenda Patimkin definitely was not ine . I had to work like a maniac to accomplish whatever I accomplished in Columbus . An actress is fair game for critics . It 's their right to say I act atrociously because it very well may be true . But I did resent the critic who said I was just being me in Columbus . " The thing is , I do each scene over five or six or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then somebody says gee , you had a breeze doing that scene . I work like a dog to make it look as if I 'm not working at all , to make it seem easy and natural . " 1 like to create a character who is memor  --  able , not just stand up and be me . Of course , I will always be me , but since I am inventing some  --  thing I have to be more than that . I have n't yet read the script where I have said to myself . ' I 'm that girl . She 's me . ' The fun of it is finding what the character would n't do , and learning it , and making it part of you for two hours . I think I am a creative person up there on the screen . If I ca n't create that person I wo n't have fun doing my job . " All saw that kind of person in Jenny Cavilleri , the heroine of Love Story , although she is ex  --  tremely self-critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I played the role of Jennifer was n't as multi-faceted as I would have liked it to be . Given the language she has to use , she may seem a little overbearing . She 's constantly making some smart remark and that 's not enough . A human being has to have more than that . I guess I should have found more things for her to be . I tried , but I did n't find enough to round her out so that you would n't have to read her as brash . " Some of Jenny 's scenes were terribly hard . One I was never satisfied with was the so-called fight scene on the telephone . And I had a diffi  --  cult time with the scene where Oliver offers to take Jenny to Paris after he learns she 's dying of leukemia . Jenny has to say , ' I do n't want Paris , do n't need Paris , I need you . ' The only reason it works is because of the director , Arthur Hiller , because he just coaxed me and coaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about . I guess it 's just because I do n't know if I would have her strength . I do n't know that as Ali MacGraw I would n't cry and ... " She paused , and I tried to prompt her . " And go to Paris , maybe ? " " No , not that . I just do n't know if I could coolly pick up my cucumber salad and say , ' Listen , I know what is going on , and let 's not talk about it any more . ' Luckily for me , I have never been that sick , so I had a difficult time believing that quietness would be enough to convey Jenny 's feelings . But Arthur thought it was . And it 's funny , because I 've read reviews that point that scene out as being a really good one . If it 's good , it 's entirely because of Arthur . " I apparently have a problem , " she added . " In the movie I make a lot of faces . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces all my life . But a lot of the faces I made in that movie were inadvertent . I must have read it at least once in every review , ' Spare us those smug , contemptuous faces that Ali MacGraw makes . ' I did n't mean to be contemptuous . I never thought I was . But a lot of people mentioned it . " That 's not all the critics mentioned . I asked All what she thought was eating them . " What seems to infuriate some critics is this . It 's so successful . The more people who line up to see it of an afternoon and then bring their husbands back that same night to see it , the angrier the critics become . You can almost see them foaming at the mouth and complaining , ' How dare they , after what I 've written about it ? ' It 's a curious reaction . It 's fine to say anything you want to about any film . If you 're a critic that 's your right . But if somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine with you , too . " I 've read some very negative reviews of Love Story , but they were reviews which had been carefully thought out . I 'm sure they were sincere . The fact that millions of people go to see the movie does n't make those adverse criticisms or opinions any less real or honest . What I do n't understand is why some of the critics are so up  --  tight about it . I 'm very outspoken myself . Many times when I think something , there are n't fifty people who agree with me . But I do n't feel threatened . I just feel okay . " In my opinion , everybody should go to every movie in this frame of mind : I 'm just going to see the movie . I 'm not anticipating anything . I 'll have a nice time or hate it , whichever I like . I know some people who go and say , I 'm just not going to like it because I 've already made up my mind I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've read the book , and I think it 's unimportant and trivial , so I resent it being made into a movie . ' I 'm refusing to get into putting those people down . I go to a movie hoping that I will like it . " She said , " 1 have no quarrel with the critics who said I was atrocious in Love Story and I mean really atrocious . I hope you understand this when you write your story about me . I do n't want to be part of any hassle with the critics . Whatever they say is just fine with me . I do n't have to defend this movie . It 's over and donewith . Now on to the next thing in my life . I do n't open magazines and see Love Story being put down and grow hysterical about it . 1 honest  --  ly do n't give a damn . " Was she surprised at Love Story 's phenomenal success ? " All of us , my husband Bob , the producer and I were surprised at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed this one ? I do n't know what Arthur Hiller thought , but I do know that all of us , every single person , Erich Segal included , are thunderstruck at what has happened . Maybe it came along just at a time when the public was ready for it . 1 think that had something to do with it . Maybe three things : timing , the fact that it was well-publicized and that it 's been a well-handled movie . Also , the fact that the book was a great success before the movie reached the screen . If most people who liked the book go to see the film , that 's millions of people . The book had a lot to do with it . " When I read the script I thought it would be sort of like a little European love story , certainly not as great as Brief Encounter , which is one of my favorites : Bob thought that , too . He never thought ' Wow ! This is going to be the biggest money-maker Paramount has ever had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to start a trend thing . ' He said , ' This is a nice little movie . ' " Then , as time went on , he got more and more involved with it . And he began to work along with everybody else on it . But the truth is , Bob does that with every film Paramount turns out . I know it sounds a little unbelievable be . cause I 'm married to him , but I 've watched him work too hard on too many details on other films that did n't have his wife in them to think for a moment that he did anything special for me this time . He cares about details ; that 's why he 's good at his job . He cared about the details of Love Story , too , but that did n't make it different as far as he was concerned . I spend too many evenings in my room while he 's at the studio working with directors on other films to think he gave Love Story extra care . Of course he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every Para  --  mount film , hot or cold . The thing is that Love Story had the unbelievable luck that everything worked out . Most films do n't have that going for them . " The thing that 's more important than Love Story is this : I 'm concerned with knowing my  --  self , understanding myself and respecting myself . I have high standards . My values are high , too . I make heavy demands on myself . I want to know who I am , very thoroughly , and know what I can do . I think I know more now out of necessity because of all the unreal stuff that is going on around me . I am trying to learn what means so much to me that 1 ca n't he without it , and have my life consumed with that , and only a little with junk which means nothing to me . What my life is going to be about had better not be about being a movie star , that 's all . " I 've been asked , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't answer that for a simple reason . I do n't know . They do n't talk about film business . I think they are understandably afraid that I 'll be carried away with all the attention I am getting . So they never talk to me about films or motion pictures at all . They think what happens when you are a starlet or whatever , will go to my head and my values will change . Continued on page 106 continued from page 53 " They 're wrong , although some  --  times when I get very , very nervous ( which is often , lately ) I have the feeling that they think my life has become crazy because of film suc  --  cess , " I give that a lot of thought ; in fact I think about it constantly . 1 plan to keep it from getting to me by organizing my life very coldly , as if somebody else was organizing it . Most of my time is going to be spent with things that mean the most to me . Reading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I 'm trying to keep un  --  touched is real life , as opposed to reel life . My big dream is n't the most expensive , lavish house in the world . Bob and I have a pretty big house in California but that does n't mean anything to me . Money does n't mean much to me , either . If it happens to be a fat month or if it 's a skinny month I can live on exactly what I have . " A lot of people think that I 've always lived in comfort and ease and did n't have to worry about anything . But sometimes I 've had to count my money very carefully and choose between fresh flowers for the table or a salad . Fortunately I have great flexibility that way , and rye never starved . So it never bothered me and it would n't bother me if I have to live that way again . " Some people have the jerky idea that if you say that you lived in Westchester County , you must have had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were two miles between houses , and during the war we walked because gas was rationed . It was still country , fields and woods . Since then a lot of those big tracts of land have been sold off to developers who build tacky houses . The biggest shock in my life was to go there one day with Bob and find the beautiful , beautiful woods I used to play in filled , every other acre , with a shoddy little house that somebody was going to be stuck with for $70,000 . " I love real country . And I like to be smack in the city , too . I ca n't stand the in between . To me , New York is a kind of special place and I enjoy it . I like the fact that in about eleven seconds you can be everywhere . And I do n't mean leap  --  ing from expensive restaurants to the theatre . Just to walk down a New York street is an experience . I lived here for 12 years , and I love it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York now because of the constant strikes of every kind of public utility em  --  ployee , and the filth . But I think it 's the most exciting and rewarding place in the world . I certainly would n't like to be paying 40 cents to get on the subway . When I was taking subways they were 15 centsor 20 cents , and 40 cents is a lot of money for some people to pay out twice a day . That 's a lot , just to get on that thing , and sit in the dark ? probably stand up . " If New York could only func  --  tion physically better as a city . I 've never been in a place that I 've loved as much , a city I 've loved as much . Maybe Paris , but I have n't lived there long enough , that is . Paris is a place I would have loved to live in . " I prefer not to live in a house surrounded on four sides by other houses . I 'd hate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of privacy . That would drive me crazy . In a city like New York you can have tremendous privacy , al  --  though of a different kind . I mean there are anonymous places to walk . You can make being a private person your life-style . It 's harder for me now that Love Story has come out . More people recognize me on the streets . Sometimes , when we go to a place to eat they ask me for my autograph . I think probably what had a lot to do with it was being on the cover of Time . Al  --  though T did n't think that cover was a striking likeness of me . They made me a pretty girl , but that 's not me . " Maybe I wo n't be able to sur vive it in spite of the fact that so many people , including my hus  --  band , are trying to build walls around me . They sense my vulner  --  ability . They love me and they want to help me get through it all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous . But if I find I ca n't get through it , I 'll quit . " How will I know when that time comes ? What will tell me I ca n't take it any more ? One thing : If I get so nervous I ca n't deal with my family any more . Or if 1 found myself perpetually depressed and frightened . That will be another way . " Would she rather stop making movies altoget her ? " I 'd really like to do about one picture a year at the very most , " she said . " Definitely not more than that . It takes too much out of my real life . I loved the three months that I spent making Love Story , but I think three months is enough time to be diluting what I give my family . " 1 hope not to do any work un  --  til fall . I suppose if I read an out  --  standing script , the most outstand  --  ing in my life , and had a chance to work with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose I would be torn a little . But I have a feelinginside that 1 will have everything sorted out better if I have six months of just being with my new baby and living in our house with Bob and just organizing my life . After that I think I 'd love to do a film . " But tell you this much . I do n't look forward to doing an  --  other story with the same kind of girl in it like Brenda in Columbus and Jennifer in Love Story . That would be a very big mistake . I do n't want to be again just a pretty , 24-year-old girl with long brown hair . I do n't want the public saying , ' Here we go again . There she is with those blue jeans on . ' " For one thing I could do a peri  --  od piece . I could go back 20 or 30 years . I 'd love it . I 'd like to do an older girl . Someone closer to my own age . A woman , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do a 121-year-old man , but I 'd not believe me as a 121-year-old woman . Dustin 's stretch is incredi  --  ble . " I do n't think about being durable ? whether I 'm going to last or not . I do n't care a hoot . It 's weird . I just do n't . There must he something wrong with me . Maybe that 's a big thing in my favor . May  --  be I 'll last because if I try too hard I might not make it . I care very much about being good at whatever I 'm doing . I care a lot . I want what  --  ever I can do well . But I have n't got my life planned around work in films . I hope I can because it is my favorite thing that I have done . But as I 've said , 1 do n't enjoy the stuff in between at all . " Outside her hotel door when I buzzed for a down elevator , I re  --  membered her voice . Young , warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leap at her jugu  --  lar from the jungle that grows around celebrities , that nothing would threaten her impossible easy stardom , bruise her young mother  --  hood , That walking the razor edge we all have to walk to keep a mar  --  riage from coming unstuck neither she nor her husband would stumble . I wanted her to be continually guarded against the weirdos she calls " Star Freakers , " meaning those who are driven out of their odd and twisted minds by the pre  --  sence of the film super nova . " Star Freakers " want to see , hear , touch what they call " somebody . " If they come away from their brush with stardom triumphantly and idiotical  --  ly brandishing an autograph , they rush wildly to show it to other " Star Freakers " not so lucky . Those who know her better than I would rather suffer such wounds themselves than have her armor pierced . 1 had only met her once . I talked to her only two hours .
