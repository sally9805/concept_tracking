txt The proposed Republican platform released today charges that the Democratic party " has been seized by a radical clique which scorns:our nation 's past and would blight her future . " On Vietnam , the platform says the United States should not perform an " act of betrayal " by overthrowing the Saigon ( Government and " we most emphatically say the President of the United States should not go begging to Hanoi . " The preamble and the foreign policy section of the platform Were completed by the Resolutions Committee for presentation next week to the Republican National Convention . As expected , the document endorses President Nixon 's policies , but the two sections are filled with tough language , tougher than that used by the President . Democrats Accused Written largely in the White House and approved by the committee , the document was seen here as setting the tone for a bare-knuckles campaign in which the Democrats will be accused , as the platform says , of being " bemused with surrender " in Indochina and being engaged in a " convulsive leftward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Arizona , the committee chairman , said the remaining sections of the document , which will run to about 24,000 words , would be completed by tomorrow night . The committee was at work tonight on sections that entailed heated fights on labor policy and day care centers . " This year , " said the preamble , " the choice is between moderate goals historically sought by both major parties and far-out goals of the far left . The contest is not between the two great parties Americans have known in previous years . For in this year 1972 the national Democratic party has been seized by a radical clique which scorns our nation 's past and would blight her future . " Forward or Back " The choice is between going forward from dramatic achievements to predictable new achievements , or turning back toward a nightmarish time in which the torch of free America was virtually snuffed out in a storm of violence and protest , " it said . " It is so easy to forget how frightful it was . " There was Vietnam ? so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At home , the document says , // " our horrified people watched our cities burn , crime burgeon , campuses dissolve into chaos . " Three and one-half years later , it continues , there is " a calmer sea with a sure , steady hand at the helm , " and the nation is undergoing " a saga of exhilarating progress , " with " a quarter-billion Americans peaceful and prospering as never before , humane as never before , their nation strong and just as never before . " On Vietnam , the proposed platform praises Mr. Nixon 's withdrawal of American ground troops and his efforts at peace negotiations . " We take specific note of the remaining major obstacles to settlement ? Hanoi 's deH mand that the United States ' overthrow the Saigon Government and impose a Communistdominated Government on the South Vietnamese , " it says . " We commend ' the President 's refusal to perform this act of betrayal , and we most emphatically say the President of the United States should not go begging to Hanoi . We believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four months after an internationally supervised ceasefire has gone into effect throughout Indochina and all prisoners have been returned is as generous an offer as can be made by anyone ? by anyone , that is , who is not bemused with surrender ? by anyone who seeks , not a fleeting peace at whatever cost , but a real peace that will be both just and lasting . " On American prisoners , the platform says : " We insist that , before all American forces are withdrawn from Vietnam , American prisoners must be returned and a full accounting made of the missing in action and of those who have died in enemy hands . " On the Middle East , the document says : " We will continue to act to prevent the development of a military imbalance which would imperil peace in the region and elsewhere by providing Israel with support essential for her security , including aircraft , training and modern and sophisticated military equipment , and also by helping friendly Arab governments and peoples , including support for their efforts to diminish their dependence on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our political opposition to slash the defense forces of the United States  --  specifically by cutting the strength of our fleet , by reducing our aircraft carriers from 16 to'six and by unilateral , withdrawals from Europe ? would increase the threat of war in the Middle East and gravely menace Israel . " On defense , the proposed platform says : " The new Democratic left would undercut our defenses and have America retreat into virtual isolation . We categorically reject this slashnow , beg-later approach to defense policy . " " We will surely fail to achieve lasting peace if we go crawling to the conference table , " the document says . " Military weakness is not the path to peace : it is invitation to war . " " We reject a whimpering ' come back America ' retreat into isolationism . " Mr. Rhodes said at a news conference that some minor changes , but not substantive ones , were made by the committee in the draft document made public today .
