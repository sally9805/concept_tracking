Campaign fever hit Miami and surrounding Dade County last week and press and television reporters moved in to record the frenzy . A key mayoralty election ? No . The latest and perhaps final chapter in the struggle over whether to retain Dade County 's bitterly debated ordinance outlawing discrimination against homosexuals in housing , employment and public accommodations . This week the county will hold a referendum to decide whether or not to rescind the law . Already the issue has grown into a symbol of the countrywide battle for homosexual rights-pitting the zeal of Singer Anita Bryant , the pro-repeal crusader , against the anti-repeal efforts of newly energized gay activists . <P> Born Again . The ordinance was enacted last January despite the opposition of Bryant . Now 37 , she was a runner-up for Miss America in 1959 and has made several million-record sellers . She earns around $500,000 a year , including $100,000 for extolling Florida citrus fruits on TV . A devout Baptist , Bryant claims she was " born again " at the age of eight . As an entertainer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she opposes this ordinance because it prevents private and parochial schools from discriminating against homosexuals in hiring teachers . Her four children attend a Baptist school . Says she : " When the law requires you to let an admitted homosexual teach your children and serve as a model for them , it 's time to stop being so tolerant . " Her main argument : " The Bible clearly says homosexuality is an abomination . " <P> Joining with other anti-homosexual forces around Miami , she became the prime mover behind Save Our Children , Inc. , and collected 66,000 signatures , more than enough to force this week 's referendum on the ordinance . <P> Replying to Bryant 's charge that homosexual teachers could harm their pupils , Miami 's gay activists say there have been no such incidents in any of the 38 other cities and counties with similar laws . They claim , with the backing of some psychiatric evidence , that a person 's sexual orientation is fixed between the ages of three and five . <P> Although they have remained quiet in the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reside , are distributing buttons and hawking T shirts reading ANITA , DEAR , CRAM IT . The group has put together a get-out-the-vote drive and mailed some 250,000 pamphlets in the campaign 's closing days . <P> The Dade County Democratic Party has endorsed the ordinance . So has the National Council of Churches and 125 local clergymen . Gay activists have persuaded a variety of big names-including Feminist Gloria Steinem and former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark-to come to Miami . The biggest surprise has been contributions : some $350,000 has poured in , mostly in small sums , much of it from anonymous donors , at least half from outside Florida .
