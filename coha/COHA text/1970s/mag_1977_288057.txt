And nowhere to go but up <P> " We used to call Clay Felker our drinking editor , not because he had a more agile elbow than any of the rest of us , but simply because he . . . managed to get to more parties in a week than anybody else in a month . " <P> Thus did Esquire Founding Editor Arnold Gingrich ( 1903-76 ) once describe a certain garrulous subeditor who worked on the magazine during the highest of its haute-smartass days nearly two decades ago . Young Felker left Esquire in 1962 , but became even more conspicuous in publishing and partying circles by founding New York in 1968 , losing it this year in a bitter fight with Australian Sleaze-paper Publisher Rupert Murdoch ( TIME , Jan. 17 ) , and then scouring the globe for some new publishing adventure . Last week he found an old one : Esquire . <P> <P> For an estimated $5 million , the prodigal-along with his former New York designer Milton Glaser and Publisher Vere Harmsworth 's Associated Newspapers Group Ltd .

Glaser will become design director , Felker editor in chief as well as the chief executive of the magazine company ; Harmsworth will be chairman . <P> The acquisition is richer in history than profit .

But with the rise of raunchier men 's books ( Hugh Hefner dreamed up Playboy after leaving a $60 a week Esquire promotion-writing job in 1952 ) , and uncertainty about what Esquire 's voice should be ( the monthly has had four editors in as many years ) , advertising and circulation have dwindled . Over the past two fiscal years , Esquire lost more than $2 million . <P> The magazine has recovered somewhat this year ; first-quarter ad pages were ahead 30% and newsstand sales were up 10% , though total circulation is down a bit , to 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Esquire more timely-by shortening its Rip Van Winklesque lead time ( the January issue is now in preparation ) and doubling the magazine 's frequency . Felker , 51 , is tight-lipped about what else may mark his reign , but emphatic about what will not . Still smarting from his takeover by Murdoch , he has worked out an agreement with Harmsworth , whose firm is putting up most of the purchase price , that he will not be removed while Esquire is successful . Vows he : " What happened with New York will never happen again . "
