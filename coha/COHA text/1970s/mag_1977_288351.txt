Loophole closing gives way to deeper cuts <P> While continuing to shift the scenery about backstage , the Carter Administration last week announced another delay in raising the curtain on its anxiously awaited tax-reform program . The news came from a weary Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal , after a grueling five-hour White House session on tax options in which the President and his top economic aides failed to resolve a number of key issues . <P> Completion of the package , which was once supposed to go to Congress by Oct. 6 , has already been postponed several times , and Blumenthal now says that at least one more meeting with the President is needed before the proposals are unveiled , perhaps at the end of this month or early in November . The White House is fighting a self-imposed deadline : unless congressional hearings on tax revision begin this year , there is little hope of getting the program through Congress before the 1978 elections . <P> The prime reason for the delay is that the Administration wants to wait until the bitter congressional fight over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid getting the tax-revision proposals entangled in that scrap . Also , the White House has lately become increasingly concerned about possible sluggishness in the economy next year , and about the stiffening resistance of businessmen and some Congressmen to the tax-reform plan , even before it has officially been announced . In order both to pep up the economy and , they hope , disarm critics , Administration planners are subtly shifting the emphasis of the tax package from a program of reform to one of stimulative tax cuts , especially for business . <P> Carter at one time spoke of a reform program that would shift the tax burden but would involve little change in Government revenues or none at all . However , by last month a Treasury planning paper called for a net tax reduction of $17.2 billion to be phased in over several years-$13.8 billion going to individuals , $3.4 billion to business . Last week Blumenthal reported that White House planners were considering deepening the net cut to as much as $22 billion-possibly $15 billion to individuals , $7 billion to corporations . The aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would eventually perk up the economy . What form the enlarged business reductions would take-if indeed they are made at all-has not yet been decided . <P> <P> For the shorter term , Charles Schultze , chief of the Council of Economic Advisers , is concerned about a possible slowdown in the economy during the second half of next year . The CEA has suggested that the President consider asking Congress for a " quickie " tax cut next year in the event that stimulus is needed before the tax-reform bill is passed . The President , at his press conference last week , stopped just short of endorsing the idea when he said that a tax cut " may come next year or perhaps later-I think next year . " One idea is to propose lowering withholding rates as early as next April , in anticipation of passage of a permanent reduction in the tax package . No decision is likely on this option until early next year .
