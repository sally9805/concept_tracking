JAPAN 'S National Railways boasts the fastest trains in the world ( up to 120 m.p.h . ) . But its commuter trains , which carry 10 million commuters in and out of the Tokyo area every day are appalling . For the past three weeks , a slowdown by the National Railway Union has changed conditions from awful to intolerable . The breaking point finally came at Ageo station , 25 miles north of Tokyo , where a swarm of 10,000 commuters suddenly went berserk as their Tokyo-bound train arrived late and packed to the doors . " Korose ! " ( Kill them ! ) , someone yelled . The motorman was pulled from his cab and beaten , windows were smashed , and vending machines kicked in . Total number of injured during the slowdown : 91 . Said one commuter proudly : " Now they know we are not cattle . "
