If the Khomeini regime falls , it is quite possible that the Iranian left will come to power because of the virtual disintegration of all political forces in the mod erate center . Of the three major leftist parties , the Fedayan and Tudeh believe in Marxism and the Mujahedin in Islamic socialism , a variant that provides for a belief in God . Only the Communist Tudeh Party appears to be closely associated with the Soviet Union . All three parties are hostile to the West . <P> The Fedayan and Mujahedin are the more dynamic groups with a degree of support among the masses and in the armed services . The most persistent and ferocious of the Shah 's opponents , they were brutally suppressed and suffered heavy losses . But they continued to provoke bloody clashes with SAVAK and played a major role in the battle for Tehran , which led to the Shah 's downfall . Says a Mujahedin leader : " We have waded through blood and fire to our present status . " <P> The Mujahedin is the more moderate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it differs in wanting to establish a classless society , or " pure Shi'ism . " The party boycotted the referendum on the theocratic constitution , and it refused to surrender the arsenal it had built up during its long struggle against the Shah . Persecuted by Khomeini forces , the Mujahedin nevertheless feel they are spiritually akin . Says a party leader : " The struggle is between two kinds of Islam , two kinds of Shi'ism , not them and us . " <P> The Fedayan , on the other hand , are a hard-line secular group with no ties of any kind to Khomeini . They were the first political group to stage marches against the government after the fall of the Shah . They sent thousands of guerrillas to fight against Khomeini 's forces in Kurdistan , thereby demonstrating a capacity to put an army into the field . But they did not take part in the recent rebellion against the constitution in Tabriz . Explains a Fedayan leader : " We do not join any movement simply because it is opposed to the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class privilege , the exercise of national sovereignty by genuine , grass-roots popular councils . " <P> Though some of their leaders were trained by Palestinians , the Fedayan consider themselves to be devout Iranian nationalists . They scorn the Soviet Union for backsliding from Marxist-Leninist principles and for giving Iranians advice that primarily serves Moscow . <P> Unlike the Fedayan and Mujahedin , the Communist Tudeh Party operates openly in Iran despite its firm ties to the Soviet Union . It has cheerfully supported the establishment of a rigid Islamic state in Iran . Says Tudeh Leader Noureddin Kianuri : " Our party 's objectives are identical with those of Khomeini : the eradication of all forms of imperialism , particularly from America . "
