txt Letters The M.T.A. 's Answer to Bus Bunching To the Editor : In response to Professor William Vickrey 's June 29 letter regarding installation of a Computerized , Automated , Bus Spacing and Dispatching System , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is aware of and has taken steps to alleviate the bus bunching problem in New York City . In fact , we are currently testing a system similar to but more sophisticated than the one Professor Vickrey espouses . An experimental bus radio data locator is being tested on routes operating out of the Transit Authority 's Queens Village depot . Currently , the system is being utilized to pinpoint present and previous bus locations . In the future , as sophisticated programs are added , it will also be able to report mechanical malfunctions . Eventually , the system may be utilized to give a loading profile , or actual count of the Con Ed Is Ready To Test-Burn Coal To the Editor : We were pleased to read in Terry Agriss 's letter ( July 7 ) that the state Department of Environmental Conservation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Con Edison 's application to pre-test the burning of coal by burning higher sulfur oil . But we are puzzled by some of the letter 's statements . Our " gasoline line " ads are intended to let the public know there are alternatives to an energy policy that results in gasoline lines and heating oil shortages . As the ads point out , our nation should use " the right fuel for the right purpose . " The ads are not intended to imply that D.E.C. is delaying our current application . In fact , though her letter does not mention it , Ms. Agriss 's agency has informally indicated it expects to hold hearings in September on the application we filed in February . This is indeed " expeditious " treatment when compared to the more than four years taken by former D.E.C. officials when they rejected our previous application for a variance to use less expensive higher sulfur fuel . But , for the record , we have submitted an application for the test-burn of higher sulfur oil to prove we could burn coal without violating Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested additional data not available when we filed the application , specifically an air dispersion analysis based on a computer model of the anticipated test results . We have had good cooperation from D.E.C. staff in preparing this analysis . These data will be submitted within a few weeks in time to meet a September schedule . JOYCE HERGENHAN Vice President , Con Edison New York , July 9 , 1979 o uie tenor : With auto sales in a profound stump and auto inventories at an all-time high , the . U.S. economy could easily slip into another serious economic recession . The fastest way to solve the gasoline shortage problem without rationing , however , is to quickly replace automobiles having an average fuel economy of less than 19 miles per gallon with smaller , more efficient cars . Income-conditioned tax credits for new cars exceeding the 1980 goal of 20 miles per gallon might be an effective way to revive auto sales and encourage low-and moderate-income families to replace gas-guzzlers with new cars offering superior fuel economy . I would advocate a maximum tax credit of $1,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less who order a new fuel-efnumber of passengers on each bus . This will help prevent overcrowding on some buses and underutilization of others . Our system , designed by Motorola , enables a dispatcher to compare bus location with the schedule . All buses are equipped with two-way radios , so he can then advise a driver to slow down if buses are bunching . In addition , buses are equipped with silent alarms for reporting emergencies . If the dispatcher sees a flashing light indicating an emergency signal , he can notify police immediately and direct them to the bus . By late summer , the system will be programmed to indicate if a bus is slow , on-time or fast . A refinement to this system will give the dispatcher additional scheduling information , such as the time a bus was due at one location , when it is expected at the // Stuart Leeds Official Cars on W-2 's To the Editor : Apropos Mayor Koch 's effort to cut back the use of city autos , I was taken with some of the reasons given for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found public transit unsuitable for security reasons or that it was " difficult , exhausting , and wasteful . " I think this is the feeling of most New Yorkers about public transit , but we are not furnished with chauffeurdriven limousines to take us to work and home . There is a simple solution which involves applying existing laws . If a lower-level employee were to be given two tokens a day to get back and forth from work , this would be taxable income to him . Why not include the value of a chauffeur-driven limousine furnished to city officials on their 1V-2 Forms and have them pay income tax on this fringe benefit ? I estimate the value of such a car at between $20,000 and $30,000 a year . If city officials had to pay tax on that amount out of their own pockets , the lines to return city cars would rival the lines at gas stations . CARL T. MURZIN Great Neck , L. I. , July 5,1979 ficient car before the year 's end . An additional deduction of $50 from this credit might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the size of the credit is reduced to a minimum of , say , $200 . Tax credits of this magnitude would be especially useful in helping to compensate middle-income families for the loss in market value that will be sustained if they trade in a relatively new gas guzzler for a more efficient vehicle . Since they will be freeing up gasoline for others to use , there is an important sense in which the buyers of new cars ought to be compensated for such losses and rewarded for making others better off . EDWARD F. RENSHAW Professor of Economics and Finance State University at Albany Albany , July 6 , 1979 next and how many minutes it has deviated from the schedule . If the program proves successful , we will expand it to other boroughs . One such system is being developed for a Staten Island depot expected to open in 1980/1981 . HAROLD L. FISHER Chairman , M.T.A. New York , July 6 , 1979 Calcutta 's Experience To the Editor : Professor Vickrey , who described a Computerized , Automated , Bus Spacing and Dispatching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative method that is used in India to encourage good timekeeping . Somb bus routes in Calcutta are served by syndicates of private bus owners . The buses are generally driven and maintained by their owners , who retain all the takings . Only the route is shared . To overcome the problem that a delayed bus will pick up more than its " fair share " of passengers , the syndicate 's rules require all late buses to pay a substantial amount to the bus following for each minute of delay in completing the route . The arrangement is reported to work well , although it is not as comprehensive as that described by Professor Vickrey . The system of private bus owners sharing a route has many advantages , and might even be worth trying in some parts of North America . GABRIEL ROTH Washington , July 3,1979 Making Policy For Society 's Ills To the Editor : ? Your series on the risks of low-level radiation might well be expanded to include the most troublesome public policy question , one associated not only with radiation , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , and hosts of other categories of workers . Increasingly , policy is made on the basis of statistical studies which indicate higher than normal incidences of particular maladies where certain groups of workers , or certain communities , are concerned . On that basis , we conclude there is a direct cause-effect relationship between the working or living environment and the malady . Unfortunately , the affected individual seldom can prove beyond question that his or her disease was a direct result of radiation , working in a coal mine , or fighting fires . We end up with an ironic contradiction ; while we admit a certain problem does indeed affect large numbers of people , we deny them relief on a case-by-case basis . A rare exception is New York 's " heart law " for firefighters and policemen , a law subject to continuing attack . I suggest we must address the contradiction . We can not admit a problem affects society as a whole while refusing to admit it affects individuals in that society . FREDERICK C. THAYER Assoc . Prof. , Graduate School of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , 1979 Cause and Effect To the Editor : Is n't it strange ! Germans value freedom from speed limits and other gas regulations , and end up without a shortage . They value sound money over lavish Government spending , and end up with the lowest inflation rate in the Western world . Can anybody see cause-and-effect relationships here ? A. J. DAVIES Ricigeiieid , July 1 , 1979 Tax Credits for Fuel-Efficient Cars The West Bank Belongs to Its People From Time Immemorial ' To the Editor : I will confine my remarks in replying to Yaaqov Berman 's June 13 letter to a few self-evident facts that can be instantly and categorically verified in the computerized files of The Times . ? For Mr. Berman to suggest that the Arab Legion , which had served in the whole of Palestine during World War II and which had withdrawn on May 15 , 1998 , in deference to U.N . resolutions , was a totally different force from the " Jordanian Army , " " established solely for annexing Palestine to Jordan , " which had re-entered Jerusalem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , totally untrue and untenable . No country in the world can miraculously establish a combat-fit , new army in two to three days . Mr. Berman 's allegation accords Jordan providential powers which it neither claims nor would be self-deluded to accept . ? The British named the Jordan Army the " Arab Legion " during that period because its size of 9,000 to 5,000 men did not entitle it to be named the Jordan Army corps in a global war . In Jordan , and the rest of the Arab World , it was known as the " Arab Army " ( al-Jaysh al-Arabi ) because its mission was a continuum of the great Arab Rebellion of World War I. ? That the Jordan Army had a number of senior British Army officers is not unique . The Jewish Brigade was , likewise , commanded largely by British officers , because they were more highly qualified . Besides , the Jewish Brigade and the Hagana became known as the Israeli Defense Army . Indeed , General Dayan and most of the top-level commanders of the present Israeli Army made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Dayan sustained his eye loss as a lieutenant in the British expedition which wrested Syria and the Lebanon from Vichy France . ? That the Jordan Army did not establish a Palestinian state was the result of Israel 's conquest of substantial territories that had been earmarked for a Palestinian State . Cut off from all sides except the east , Jerusalem and West Bank citizens , in their truncated and encircled enclave , were left with no outlet to the rest of the world save through Jordan to the East . It was they , therefore , who fervently sought unity in order to survive , quite apart from their inherent penchant for unity . The Act of Unity of 1950 specifically provided that it should not in any way prejudice the ultimate solution to the Palestine question . ? II M. Berman believes that we are the Palestinians ' " fickle friends , " then I appeal to him to be more compassionate and sincere toward the victimized Palestinians by pressing the Israeli leadership , which presently controls the whole country , to concede to the Palestinians their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and co-exist with them in peace , dignity and amity . I would be the first to applaud him if he does that and proves me and my Government " fickle friends " of the Palestinians . Yes , the West Bank belongs to its people from time immemorial , and is not " up for grabs " by anyone .
