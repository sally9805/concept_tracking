20 Supply and Demand Treating Heroin Addiction by Peter J. Ognibene There are more than a half million Americans who use heroin . Most are addicts who support their habit by committing crimes such as burglary , prostitution and robbery . A $40 or $50 a day heroin habit would require $150-$200 in stolen property to sustain the addict for a single day . It is estimated that half of all property crimes in New York City are committed by narcotics addicts . The cost to the nation in property losses is several billion dollars a year . The human costs are incalculable . Every year more than a million kilograms of opium are illicitly harvested . Most of it is grown and consumed in Asia , but about a fifth of the crop is thought to enter the international market . Worldwide heroin seizures this year are expected to account for about four percent of the crop , which is 20 percent of the heroin in international traffic . These seizures have had an effect in the United States on the availability ( low ) , price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the streets . One government official involved in controlling illicit drug traffic believes it is only a matter of time before more of the world 's illicit opium finds its way here through new channels . A recent General Accounting Office study on international narcotics trafficking notes : " The illegality of heroin is the sole reason for its high cost in this country ; in England the pharmacy cost is $0.04 per grain compared with a US street price of from $30 to $90 per grain . " If alcoholics can get their " fix " at neighborhood bars or liquor stores which in many places are state-operated , why , some ask , should n't narcotics addicts be able to " pick their poison " at local pharmacies ? Legalizing heroin would destroy its profitability and almost certainly lead to the end of illicit trafficking , much as the 21st Amendment knocked out bootlegging in " wet " states . Taking the profit out of the heroin trade , however , would probably not lower its use . On the contrary , there is reason to believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroin would lead to more people experimenting with the drug and becoming addicted to it . Heroin maintenance would require high doses administered three or four times a day . It is foolish to expect an addict to make multiple visits to a clinic and at the same time be able to lead anything like a " normal " life . Permitting take-home doses would result in increased experimentation by new users of the addict 's acquaintance . " Heroin addiction is analogous to an infectious epidemic , " says Dr. Peter Bourne , the former director of Georgia 's narcotics treatment programs who is now an assistant director of the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention ( SAODAP ) . " It spreads by face to face contact among friends . One addict , a Vietnam veteran , told me he had gotten 50 people started on heroin since his return . " The dope pusher , contrary to legend , is more of a local merchant than an initiator of young innocents . Bourne is hopeful heroin contagion can be DECEMBER 23 &; 30 , 1972 reversed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other addicts . SAODAP has been in business for a year and a half overseeing the drug abuse programs of 19 federal departments and agencies . Its director , Dr. Jerome H. Jaffe , is responsible to the President for " coordinating all of the federal drug abuse prevention efforts in treatment , rehabilitation , education , training and research . " Law enforcement activities are now within his purview . SAODAP currently is concentrating its resources on increasing the availability of medical treatment for heroin addicts . When Jaffe appeared before the House Appropriations Committee in September , he reported there were 60,000 heroin addicts being treated and " another 30,000 . . . still on waiting lists , hoping that treatment capacity will soon expand .. We must create a situation in which treatment is so readily available that no man can say he committed a crime because he could n't get treatment . " Jaffe estimates a " need for a treatment capacity of between 160,000 and 175,000 treatment ' slots , ' since each ' slot ' provides treatment for more than one patient each year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased capacity would make it possible to treat half the nation 's heroin addicts in any one year . It 's assumed that about twice as many addicts will volunteer for treatment once the word is out that it is immediately available . New York City , for instance , has over 16,000 on its waiting list for methadone maintenance . SAODAP is providing funds for a number of different methods of treatment . " Multimodality " is the fancy word , but from the addict 's point of view it boils down to two alternatives : methadone maintenance or " cold turkey " ( detoxification ) . Although the addict in the latter instance may be given methadone or another substitute for heroin for a short period of time to delay the pain of withdrawal , he will go through withdrawal when he is later taken off the drug ( detoxified ) . Under methadone maintenance , the addict is switched from heroin to oral doses of methadone , a synthetic narcotic which blocks the need for heroin . He is thereafter maintained on a stable dose of methadone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have been successfully withdrawn from methadone . The statistics show more people in drug-free programs than in methadone , but this preponderance is illusory . " If you go to any one of the several programs that do not use chemotherapeutic approaches viz. , methadone maintenance , " Jaffe told the committee , " you will find they keep no records , We can not tell how many people are waiting and how many are treated . . . We do know there are 30,000 people seeking treatment with methadone . " In other words , Jaffe 's assertion that " we have increased drug-free programs more than we have methadone programs " is meaningless because it tells us nothing 21 about which programs nave been more effective in getting addicts off heroin . Because methadone maintenance is addiction by another name , it is controversial . Black communities which have for so long paid the heaviest price for heroin addiction are skeptical of methadone . Their objections were expressed to Jaffe by Congressman Louis Stokes ( D , Ohio ) : " They black people are aware and concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another form of narcotic addiction is not curing that human being , " Jaffe replied : " Then I guess we have to ask , what do we mean by cure ? Will they assume the responsibility for the fact that a substantial number of people who are denied treatment in programs die because they do n't seek alternatives other than methadone ? . In many parts of the country , we have 10,000 or 15,000 people on methadone who , according to the program directors , are working every day , paying taxes , being law-abiding citizens . " Methadone maintenance has been widely criticized , but the critics have yet to offer a workable alternative . At least methadone gets addicts out of the heroin-crime cycle , eliminates the considerable danger of of their getting hepatitis from heroin injections and gives them the heroin-free stability necessary for a more normal life . SAODAP has been getting larger appropriations every year to expand treatment of heroin addicts , but heroin addiction is more than just a clinician 's problem . Jaffe 's office has been curiously shortsighted about the nonmedical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myopia is its enthusiasm for " narcotic antagonists . " A SAODAP fact sheet describes the effect of these nonnarcotic , nonaddictive chemicals : " Given before an opiate , an antagonist will prevent opiate-like effects . Given after an opiate , it will antagonize or reverse the opiate effects and will precipitate a withdrawal syndrome in addicted persons . " Jaffe 's office is properly interested in narcotic antagonists and is funding research to find one that will last at least 24 hours and have no undesirable side-effects . But Jaffe and his staff seem to have given little thought to who would want to take a narcotic antagonist . Why , for instance , would a person pay $40 or $50 to buy heroin , probably committing crimes to get the money , only to have his " high " blocked by the narcotic antagonist he took that morning ? Why would he take one after a heroin fix only to " precipitate a withdrawal syndrome ? " Jaffe told the committee that he " was probably the first investigator in this country at least , and perhaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of narcotic antagonists in the treatment of heroin addiction . " The uses , however , appear limited . " One possibility is the early experimenter may benefit from the antagonists which are not an active substance and protect him from the heroin high and overdoses and 22 move from experimentation to addiction , " Jaffe said . But later in his testimony he admitted : " Last year we could find only 27 people in the whole United States in federally sponsored programs where they were using these antagonists . " Jaffe 's interest in narcotic antagonists is understandable ; what is not is how a drug which will not eliminate or reduce " drug hunger " can have the widespread use he seems to contemplate . One of the great problems facing SAODAP is educating the public about heroin and other drugs . Although the federal government has spent almost a billion dollars on drug abuse control and treatment since 1969 , a GAO study notes " this spending has not curbed drug abuse . " A study by Macro Systems , Inc. for the Department of Health , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columnist Jack Anderson published excerpts , suggests the reasons for the tailure of drug education programs : The unquestioned premise of education in general , and drug education in particular , holds that one can change behavior through information and education . There appears to be at least as much evidence disproving this premise as that supporting it . More importantly , it seems clear that youthful drug users know more about drugs than most transmitters I official sources , and prefer to seek further drug information from their peers rather than from authorized sources ... It seems evident from this study that perceptions of the dangers of drugs do not necessarily lead to desired behavioral change , and that drug use can not be explained or predicted by any single set of circumstances . . . A major finding . relates to the fact that illegal drug use is endemic among the youth population and that use of alcohol , tobacco , and mood-altering drugs on the part of adults is also widespread ... Furthermore , it has not been unequivocably sic proven that drug use , especially marijuana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to smoke marijuana because it is illegal calls the law into question not marijuana The use of drugs by young people seems to be woven into their total life style which appears to be taking place in a society saturated with many forms of drug-taking . Over 73 percent of young people state they use drugs for fun , pleasure , or to satisfy curiosity ... Furthermore , programs focused upon clearly debilitating drug use would have a better chance of being accepted . It may be more significant to attempt to reinvigorate the high schools of America , raise the quality of teaching , and provide realistic valuable activities enhancing the self-worth of our young people than embark upon a failure-ridden quest for a youthful society free from drug use ? a proposed idyllic island awash in a sea of alcohol , nicotine , and legally prescribed drug-taking . THE NEW REPUBLIC What should the government do ? Bourne says , " There 's a lot of evidence that drug abuse education has in fact been drug abuse advertising . " To whom do you address your message ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " carries the expectation that they will use drugs . " A message aimed to a general audience is likely to miss the people who need it most . The Macro study implies that if drug prevention is the goal , education is not the answer . Nothing is " the answer , " but when the public has been misinformed about the effects of drugs , it needs to be reeducated . Take , for instance , the popular misconception about heroin " overdoses , " More than 1200 people died last year from narcotics-related causes ( mostly heroin ) . In New York City it was the leading cause of death for males between the ages of 15 and 35 . The press generally attributed these deaths to " overdoses " of heroin , but a recently published Consumers Union study , Licit and Illicit Drugs , argues that the deaths were not the result of higher than usual doses of heroin , but rather of a synergistic reaction of heroin and other chemicals in the body . Three currently under suspicion are alcohol , barbiturates and quinine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government could play a credible role by spreading an awareness of the dangers of multiple drug use with heroin . A coincidental effect of such public education might be a reduction in potential heroin users and an increase in addicts seeking treatment . Educating the public about heroin " overdoses " is a reasonable task for government , but care must be exercised to guard against overzealous functionaries trying to write a larger message . For example , telling persons that they will get hooked if they try heroin could backfire , as much of the earlier anti-marijuana propaganda did . When the heroin shortage hit Atlanta this year , Bourne said , " the purity went down , and there was a tendency for people to use heroin just on the weekends . Every person who uses heroin is convinced he can handle it ; so when they used diluted heroin , they believed they were beating it . " Medical treatment can get people off heroin , but keeping them off is less of a medical than a social problem . For the patient on methadone maintenance , Bourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroin . If heroin is scarce and his friends are no longer using it , his chances of staying clean are excellent . But if heroin is readily available and his friends are using it , his chances of staying clean are practically zero . In Atlanta there was a spectacular drop in the availability of heroin and a spectacular rise in the number of people staying clean . " The danger then is clear : heroin addiction , which was thought to have peaked in recent years , may once again rise if the supply increases . Heroin addiction is " a life style problem that can not be solved by chemical means , " says Bourne . " One must first deal with the physical addiction and second DECEMBER 23 &; 30 , 1972 with the life style . Virtually every heroin addict will eventually come in and want help . If you can keep an addict involved in a program for a year , he has about a 40 percent chance of success ; two years , about an 80 percent chance of staying heroin-free . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an educational program . It is an obligation to try to get people jobs , but jobs are a function of the local economy . The job market is good in Atlanta , for example , but bad in Seattle . " The government , Bourne adds , " is not spending heavily on jobs . " When one has cut through the public relations fog , 23 one finds that the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention has a single function today : expanding methadone maintenance as rapidly as practicable . Because there is a shortage of medical facilities to treat addicts , this emphasis is perhaps necessary for the time being , but time is not on the government 's side . Late next spring a new illicit opium crop of more than a million kilograms will begin to be harvested . If narcotics traffickers succeed in diverting a greater share of it into international traffic , the United States could find itself in the midst of a resurgence of the heroin epidemic .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
