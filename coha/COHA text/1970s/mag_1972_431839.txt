 | PUBLIC DOCUMENTS The Department of the Interior recites the reasons it should n't be doing what it is doing . THE DEPARTMENT of the Interior 's cave-in to the oil industry 's demand for a pipeline right-of-way through Alaska seems to have all but escaped public notice . Not many people have the time or competence to read and digest the record laid out in a number of weighty public documents : a six-volume environmentalimpact statement , three volumes of economic analysis , a four-volume critique , plus several thousand pages of Congressional testimony . Yet displayed there are the tracks of a government agency seemingly more concerned about appearing to comply with the law than about actually observing it . The most revealing document is Interior 's own massive Final Impact Statement . This report was prepared in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 , which requires a complete statement of the possible consequences of any agency action " significantly affecting the quality of the human environment , " plus a thorough examination of the alternative courses . But Interior needed something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two years ago , the Department attempted to issue a right-of-way to Alyeska Pipeline Company to construct an 800-mile service road adjacent to the pipeline arguing , incredibly , that the two were separate projects . That move was blocked by a federal district court , in part because the court considered Interior 's eight-page impact statement patently inadequate. * To build an environmental case against the proposal to run a transAlaskan pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez , one need scarcely go beyond the information ? and conceded lack of information ? provided by the Final Impact Statement itself . In brief , there are three categories of environmental hazards associated with the pipeline : ( 1 ) constructing service roads , campsites , airstrips , pumping stations , and the pipeline itself over hundreds of miles of fragile tundra without permanently disturbing its delicate ecological balance ; ( 2 ) piping two million barrels a day through a forty-eight-inch pipe at 145 degree -- without either melting the pern frost and rupturing the pipe where the line is submerged , or blocking animal migration where it is stilted. ( 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm " at Port Valdez and transporting it to markets in 250,000L pennyweight tankers without endangering a wide spectrum of saltwater , : resources . Interior 's statement flatly admits that none of these problems has been satisfactorily resolved . these short excerpts from the repot : indicate : Virtually all activities related to pipeline and road construction have a potential to cause erosion through watershed disturbance . The frequency , volume , and location of potential spills from the pipeline system can not be modeled or predicted with the available information .  | Any point along the southern two-thirds of the proposed pipeline route could be subjected to an earthquake of magnitude greater than 7.0 on the Richter scale , and it is almost a certainty that one or more large-magnitude earthquakes will occur in the vicinity of this portion of the proposed route during the lifetime of the pipeline . Strong ground motion and large ground displacement accompanying such an earthquake could damage ? even rupture ? the proposed pipeline . In the event of a pipeline rupture , 14,000 barrels of oil could leak out during the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an additional 50,000 barrels of oil could drain from the pipeline at some localities . The report does not mention that many smaller leaks would remain undetected until substantial damage had occurred . Crude oil in concentrations as low as 0.3 mg/l is extremely toxic to fresh water fish . The pipeline would span some 350 rivers and streams , many of which are valuable spawning grounds for salmon and grayling . Numerous studies of accidental oil spills have shown that crude oil and distilled petroleum products are toxic to plants . Data from Alyeska studies show that tundra species are killed where parts of the tundra plants are coated with Prudhoe Bay crude oil . Oil-caused loss of vegetation in areas underlain by ice-rich permafrost would result in its degradation and erosion of the soil . Oil spilled in tanker casualties or transfer operations would affect the marine ecosystem to an extent that would be determined by many variable factors . The salmon and other fishery resources of Prince William Sound would be especially vulnerable to such spills . Over the long term , however , persistent lowlevel discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea could have a greater adverse effect than could short-lived larger spills . If the statement meets the environmental questions with relative candor it is much more elusive with regard to the broad public-policy justifications for the pipeline . In effect , pipeline will put the oil where it is least needed ? on the West Coast . The statement assumes instead of proves the important point , and @#  | blandly asserts that the West Coast can absorb the full output of the pipeline . It goes on to argue that this will reduce the West Coast 's dependency on the politically sensitive Middle East without ever explaining how our national-defense posture would be improved with other sections of the country almost totally dependent on foreign oil . The Department made practically no effort to judge the possible effect of the anticipated discovery of billions of additional barrels of oil beneath the Prudhoe Bay fields , to coordinate oil production with production of the 26 trillion known cubic feet of natural gas that also lie in the North Slope fields , or to acknowledge the long-term effects the pipeline will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior seems to suffer " pipeline vision , " its attentions focused exclusively within the limits of the application before it . 5EVERAL OF THE ISSUES given short shrift , or ignored altogether , by the Interior report were aired in mid-June by Senator William Proxmire 's Joint Economic Committee . The committee was examining Interior 's May 11 decision to approve the trans-Alaskan right-of-way to see what effect it would have on national energy policy . From the testimony of energy economists S. David Freeman of the Twentieth Century Fund , Charles J. Cicchetti of Resources for the Future , and Richard Nehring , a young " whistleblower " who had written segments of the Interior report and then resigned in protest over the Department 's final decision , a pattern of startling administrative ineptness and shortsightedness emerged . To start , Interior 's cheery projections of West Coast demand inexplicably assumed a rate of increase nearly double that of the past decade of extremely rapid growth , combined with projected curtailments in supply far beyond anything likely to occur . The statement also ignored other sources of supply such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , which together could bring an additional million barrels of oil a day to the West Coast . Not , of course , that the oil companies would be the ones likely to suffer . stuck with no market for their North Slope oil . The excess could be traded to Japan in exchange fe Japanese rights to Middle East o which could then be sold profitab. ' on the East Coast . Or the exec -- could be shipped by tanker to Central America , piped across the narrt , . ' neck of the continent , and trap ported for refining to the Virg : - Islands , a duty-free port . For the seven oil companies it -- volved in the venture , the benefits would be diverse and enormouARCO. for example , which is crud , poor on the West Coast , would ge : enough oil to remain competitiveplus a little something extra for Japan or the Caribbean . British Petroleun whose merger with SOHIO is cond. - tional upon its being able to produce 600,000 barrels per day by 19 r . needs the North Slope crude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which requires goods moving between American ports to travel American bottoms and upon which Interior relies heavily for the maintenance of safe navigational star : - dards ) , would be circumvented if the oil moved either to Japan or to Central America . And the complicate , web of trade-offs and dummy salt. - would present the companies with variety of ways to shortchang ? Alaska on royalty payments . @# THE WISPINESS of Interior 's logy , is best seen in its consideration et the estimated 26 to 325 trillion cubi , feet of natural gas in the North Slope fields . There are only three thingthat can be done with this gas : it car . be flared ( wasted ) ; piped out as tin oil is produced ; or reinjected into the ground for later production . After a year or so of oil production , however , the cost of reinjected gas iprohibitive . The Interior report notethat for natural gas , " route selection . and construction procedures would be similar to those for an oil pipeline . but with some simplification resulting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , though . there are important practical problems standing in the way of a trans-Alaskan gas pipeline . The gas would have to be liquified at Valdez prior to shipping , ac operation that would run to $50 ' million a year . In addition , there are only about a dozen liquified natural gas tankers operating in the world . while twenty to forty would be needed to handle the Valdez traffic alone-.  | Thus Interior concludes : " A gas pipeline across Alaska appears to be a remote possibility because of the problems involved in shipment from the southern terminus ; a gas pipeline through Canada to the Midwest appears to be much more feasible . " There is absolutely no question about the environmental benefits of Living a single long pipeline corridor instead of two , especially since additional energy reserves in the Alaskan and Canadian Arctic may attract even more pipelines in the coming decade . There is simply no long-run justification for widely divergent oil corridors . Yet Interior has considered the trans-Alaskan application in a virtual vacuum , unconnected to the area 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rounds of diplomatic discretion , Canadian officials have expressed friendly interest in a trans-Canadian pipeline , it would seem that a single oil-and-gas pipeline system through Canada provides the best solution . In fact , at one point an Interior task force concluded that , even if only oil production were involved , the Mackenzie River route through Canada was environmentally safer than the Valdez project since it would have fewer of the seismic problems of the Alaskan route and would involve no marine transportation . The final Interior statement carried no such recommendation ; according to Richard Nehring 's testimony before the Proxmire committee , it had been deleted by the Department . Interior Secretary Rogers C. B. Morton testified that the Department had been forced to amend the draft report because the staff analysis of the Canadian alternative " did n't take into consideration river crossings . " Whether he at once discharged the seventy-odd maladroits who had forgotten about Canadian rivers , the Secretary did not say . In any event , deletion and alteration of unfavorable staff findings had all along been Interior 's procedure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public its " draft " environmental-impact statement . But a draft of the " draft " had already been circulated among various federal agencies a month earlier and submitted for inspection to the Alyeska Pipeline Company . Gordon Watson , Director in Alaska of Interior 's Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife , detected variances between the two documents @# that he made known in a plaintive memorandum to his Washington chief , a memo subsequently leaked to the press . Among other things , the danger of oil spills to entire watersheds had been changed to refer only to rivers and streams adjacent to the pipeline route . Reference to the likelihood of major spills along the route had been deleted , and so had all discussion of tanker traffic and oil spills in Prince William Sound . Discussion of the difficulty the pipeline would pose for animal migration had been dropped . Also missing was a statement , present earlier , on the unique value of Alaska 's wilderness system . In defending Interior 's action before Proxmire , Secretary Morton recited many imponderables involved in the Canadian route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and resolution of the aboriginal land claims of Canada 's Eskimos and Indians , to list three and the costly delay that resolving these uncertainties would now entail . This argument placed Morton in the position of advertising his own Department 's lack of diligence and using it as an excuse for further sloth . " This is a private project , " Morton told his task force last year , a remark recalled by Nehring during his testimony before the Joint Committee . " If the investor does not want to put his money in the Canadian route , then it is not a real alternative . " Charles Cicchetti framed the social issue a bit more broadly , making clear the poverty of Interior 's vision . Noting the convergence of public interests in favor of a trans-Canadian route to the Midwest , he said : " Contrary to this conclusion is the position of the oil companies who , it seems , intend to utilize existing irrational industry regulations at the expense of oil consumers , taxpayers , the State of Alaska , the United States maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed the real reasons for selecting an inferior economic and environmental alternative in order to maximize their short-run profits . Accordingly , the issue being considered today is more than a question of economic or environmental superiority . In my opinion , the issue is which interest , oil profits or national well-being , will dominate major decisions of this nature . " @#
