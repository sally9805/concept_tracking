Question : With the Miami Dolphins playing in the Orange Bowl , the world 's best thoroughbreds running at Hialeah , and big-time college sports crowding the calendar , what is Florida 's biggest spectator sport ? Answer : Dog racing . The turnstiles spin merrily year-round at one or more of the state 's 17 tracks ( there are only 23 others in the rest of the U.S. ) . Despite the dearth of glamour and the shortage of champions that stand out from the pack , huge numbers of gamblers want to wager on the greyhounds that futilely chase an ersatz rabbit around an oval of either five-sixteenths or three-eighths of a mile . <P> If Florida is dog racing 's capital , its White House is the West Flagler Kennel Club in Miami . That neon and plastic Churchill Downs for dogs attracted more than a million fans last season , outdrawing the Dolphins or Hialeah . Many of the breed improvers now come and go without ever seeing a live dog . Instead , they sit in sybaritic comfort in " The Great Racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where bettors can watch the tote board and the race on a 40-ft. closed-circuit TV screen . It is more convenient to put down late bets that way . Between races they study Vince De Marco 's 75 greyhound tip sheet . When the mechanical rabbit takes off on its mad whirl around the track , the fans become possessed . Cries of " Come on , you goddam dog ! " echo through the auditorium . <P> Presiding over this six-night-a-week hound happening is Isadore Hecht , 60 , West Flagler 's owner . The former tomato grower and banana importer bought the track 20 years ago when it handled just $14 million in bets during a 13-week season . Hecht modernized the plant and produced a greyhound gold mine . In 1972 the track handled $63 million in bets ( 8% went to management ) in a 16-week meeting . Every night Hecht can be found in a posh suite of offices perched at one end of the track . There he can monitor the betting windows on TV or close the curtains and lock the office door by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few things you are n't going to stop people from doing , " he philosophizes while sitting behind an inch-high stack of $100 bills . " Smoking , drinking , and maybe sometimes placing a bet . " For Hecht , an evening at West Flagler " is an evening of fun . That 's what we call it , an evening of fun . " <P> Like a Las Vegas casino , West Flagler keeps the price of admission minimal . The best grandstand seats cost 750 or 500 , and one section is free . But in an " evening of fun , " the average fan bets $72 . Some of the more affluent , like Businessman Jos Martinez , can afford to lose repeatedly when they " wheel a Quiniela " for $6-track talk for placing a bet on three combinations of three competitors picked to win , place and show . " You never know , " says Martinez . " You can have the best dog in the race and sometimes she wo n't run . "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
