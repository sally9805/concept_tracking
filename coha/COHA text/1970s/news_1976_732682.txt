txt Jimmy Carter Tuesday was loudly booed by delegates to the American Legion national convention as he promised to pardon all Viet Nam War draft resisters if he is elected President . Shouts of " No , no , no " filled the Seattle Coliseum as delegates stood in protest , gesturing thumbs down . The chairman of the convention called for order , and the Democratic nominee continued his appeal to the Legionnaires to help " bind the wounds " caused by the war . Carter explained that he is not offering amnesty to the resisters , since that would imply approval of their actions , whereas a pardon would not . " TO ME , THERE is a difference . " he said . " Amnesty means that what you did is right . A pardon means that what you did  --  right or wrong  --  is forgiven . " Carter had predicted at a press conPresident Ford , calling for four debates with Jimmy Carter , said they should begin shortly after Labor Day .

A small group of Carter supporters in the balcony attempted to counter the demonstration with applause , but to little avail . Most delegates stood and applauded respectfully when the address was coneluded , in cool contrast to the friendly ovation given the candidate when he entered the auditorium . CARTER , WHO has outlined his pardon plan repeatedly during the campaign , was able to appease the audience slightly by explaining that he feels military deserters should be dealt with by the military courts on an individual basis rather than be included in any blanket pardon . The candidate hailed Viet Nam vetereans as " our nation 's greatest unsung heroes . " " I could never equate what they have done with those who left the countm to avoid the draft , but I think itAis time for the damage , hatred , and divisiveness of the Viet Nam War to be over , " he said .

The young people cheered , and Carter made no mention of his distinctions between an amnesty and a pardon , as he was to do with the Legionnaires . In his Legion speech Carter also urged a constant assessment of the all-volun teer Army , arguing that as civilian unemployment begins to drop it will be " much more difficult to maintain our present military strength . " ASKED AT the news conference if he would over consider reviving a peacetime draft , Carter said he would take that action if it were the only alternative , but quickly added that he does not believe it would be necessary .
