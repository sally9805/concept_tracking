txt The United States and the Soviet Union announced the formation of a joint commission today to devise a comprehensive trade agreement that has proved impossible to reach during President Nixon 's visit to Moscow . The announcement , not altogether unexpected , represented an admission by both sides that the two countries had been unable to reconcile differences on the trade issue , and it constituted the first disappointment of the Moscow summit meeting . Under the terms of the agreement , announced to reporters here by Peter M. Flanigan , Assistant to President Nixon , the joint commission will have these assignments : cTo negotiate an over-all trade agreement including reciprocal " most favored nation " treatment  --  meaning , essentially , that imports from the Soviet Union will receive the same tariff advantages given most other United States trading partners . CT ? devise arrangements under which credits will be provided to finance sales by each nation to the other . 9To negotiate provisions for the establishment of business offices in each country by concerns in the other . CTo set up an arbitration mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tired The President , himself appeared tired yet exhilarated after his first five days in the Soviet Union . At a dinner he gave this evening for Leonid I. Brezhnev , general secretary of the Soviet Communist party , Mr. Nixon raised his glass , and said : " We look forward to the time when we shall he able to welcome you in our country and in some way respond in an effective manner to the way in which you have received us so generously in your country . " In effect , today was Mr. Nixon 's last day of official meetings with Soviet leaders . He will pay a ceremonial visit to Leningrad tomorrow , rest for most of Sunday before delivering a televised address to the Soviet people that evening , and will participate in a reception Monday before flying to Kiev , Yet the final day ended on what was seen by both sides as an immensely positive note , reflected not only in the arms agreement but in the words of the dignitaries here . Mr. Nixon , in his toast tonight , called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also an " indication of what can happen in the future as we work toward peace in the world . " In response , Alexei N. Kosygin , the Soviet Premier , called the pact " a major agreement on the road toward curbing the arms race " and a " great victory for the Soviet and American peoples in the matter of easing international tension . " The joint trade commission is to hold its first meeting in Moscow in July , with Peter G. Peterson , the Secretary of Commerce , heading the American delegation . Further meetings will be held alternately in Washington and Moscow . Ronald L. Ziegler , the White House press secretary , expressed Mr. Nixon 's conviction that " this agreement can result in increased prosperity for both our people , " that the commission will in time become a " permanent institution " and that it would " contribute significantly to the efforts to improve relations between the United States and the Soviet Union . " Despite these hopeful words , however , the mere establishment of a commission to pursue objectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed to be a disappointment to the Russians and it fell short of the public expectations announced earlier by Mr. Nixon . Soviet leaders had expected to win agreement , while Mr. Nixon was here , to specific arrangements for larger agricultural imports from the United States and had hoped as well for new arrangements under which it would receive more favorable tariff treatment for Soviet exports to the United States . The day before lie left for Moscow , Mr. Nixon listed trade as one of three important areas in which he expected progress . The others were cooperation in space , which had been agreed upon earlier , and a limitation on the production and deployment of strategic nuclear weapons , signed and announced today . The announcement of the trade commission today means that the optimistic projections , voiced by some American officials about immediate expanded trade with the Soviet Union will not be realized . The Secretary of Agriculture , Earl K. Butz , forecast while in Moscow last month that American grain sales to the Soviet Union might run as high as 5209-rni ! lion a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that over-all trade between the two countries -- now about $200-million a year  --  could rise to $5-billion . In recent days , however , American officials have been scaling down their expectations , for two reasons . The first was that it had become clear that specific trade issues could not be settled in a short period of time when the two countries had a long record of tension and two quite different economic systems . Also , and from the American side this was immensely important , the United States felt that a settlement of the lendlease issue was a necessary prerequisite . The United States originally asked for $2.6-billion for what it supplied Russia after World War II , and later reduced this to $800-million . The most the Russians are known to have offered is $300-million , although this may have been increased in the current talks . Mr. Flanigan conceded that settlement of the lend-lease question would be required before Congress would agree to arrangements for a new and long-term trading relationship . " The extension of most-favored-nation treatment is dependent on Congressional action , " Mr. Flanigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through regular diplomatic channels , and Mr. Flanigan said it would not become the responsibility of the new commission . But there appeared to be little doubt that settlement of the debt was crucial to the success of the commission . Another possible reason for the delay on an accord , though neither Mr. Flanigan nor any other American official has publicly specified it , have been American reluctance to agree to new trade arrangements until it had assurance of Soviet intentions to play an active role in the settlement of problems elsewhere . At a dinner here this week , Secretary of State William P. Rogers said there was no connection between bargaining by the United States on the trade issue and its obvious desire for Soviet help on the war in Vietnam . But the indications here were that there is ' more than a casual connection between the two . It appeared to most observers here tonight that the establishment of a commission to pursue objectives that both sides would like to reach represented a compromise between Soviet desires for a quick accord and United States desires for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
