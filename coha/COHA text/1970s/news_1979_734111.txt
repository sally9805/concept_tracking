txt After 22 years of construction and nearly $100 million in expenditures , engineers here are about to open North America 's first land road to the Arctic , directly linking the population centers of the United States and Canada with the vast , wilderness areas rich in minerals north of the Arctic Circle . Until now , the region 's spectacular scenery and its resources have been reachable only by costly air transoortation , by dog sled or by water around Alaska fora short period in summer . But soon plows and bulldozers will begin removing the winter 's snow from the new road , which runs from a point near historic Dawson City north and east to Inuvik near the Beaufort Sea . And then early in April the Yukon Territorial Government will quietly open the 460-mile mad , called the Dempster Highway , to anyone with wheels . Impact of Project Unknown No one knows fur sure the impact the , project will have on the native pnpul ; i. tine , the economy , rh , . hind ? H , 1 the incluMmt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route . The road , with the accompanying spurs expected over time , will play a major role in the economic development of Canada 's far north . It is certain to attract many developers , prospectors and drilling rigs in search of the kind of riches that made the nearby Klondike such an attraction 82 years ago . The road could also provide a convenient right-of  --  way for oil or gas pipelines from Arctic deposits now being explored . And mate ; of the more than 300,000 it , ; old homers who visit the Yukon annually will likely be drawn by the woods , mountains and plains , packed with wildlife , as well as the adventure and still considerable danger of driving across the Arctic Circle in the family station wagon . Local conservationists have been , protesting against the road for years . In meetings , rambling newspaper articles and letters to the editor , they voiced fears for the region 's delicate environment , especially the unknown effects of regular motor traffic on the Porcupine caribou herd , one of the last large herds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than eight feet in the air , are an important source of food for the natives . The animals spend their summers in northeastern Alaska and wander in unpredictable patterns across the border into the Yukon each winter to forage and have their calves . " We 're talking about a lot of things happening up there that nobody knows about , " said Jack Hibberd , a former Minister of Renewable Resources . Such protests , however , have received little attention beyond this undeveloped corner of Canada . The road was built piecemeal over the years far from any significant human habitation . It had the enthusiastic support of businessmen in both the Yukon and Northwest Territories . And it fit the federal commitment to develop the north and improve Canada 's energy self-sufficiency , a key policy of successive governments in Ottawa . The governments have banned hunting along the entire highway and for five miles on both sides . Officials have promised to monitor the caribou herd for any ill effects and have not ruled out closing the highway for short periods or requiring all travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they have sought to play down news of the road 's existence . But territorial government officials are determined to keep the road open year round , at an estimated annual cost of $1.4 million . ' We Can not Stay Still ' " We will watch the environmental impact , " Dan Lang , the Yukon 's Minister of Highways and Public Works , said in an interview , " but we have to continue developing our resources . We are in the 20th century now and we have to expand our economic base . We can not stay still ; we go ahead or we go backward . So we must take some gambles to encourage growth . That 's the same way they built the transcontinental railroad . The Dempster will open early next month . " Only in the Yukon would the new road be called a " highway . " The territory , which is four times the size of New York State , has only 23,000 residents living along 2,726 miles of road . But only 119 miles of these roads are paved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which accounts for the protective steel screens on the front of so many vehicles here . Named for Corporal W.J.D. Demp. ster , a mounted policeman who found a missing patrol in the area in 1911 , the new $97 million highway starts at Route 3 about 300 miles north of here , At first it meanders through virgin forest . Then it climbs the Ogilvie Range , one of several rugged mountain ranges it encounters . Dipping into valleys and following ridge lines past spectacular waterfalls , the road moves north to the tundra above the treeline across two major bridges built by Canadian construction troops on exercises . Three convoys Make the Trip At times narrow lanes branch off , wandering for miles toward an abandoned gravel pit before stopping with no warning or space to turn around . At the halfway point there is one motel and gas station , the Eagle Plains Hotel . There are virtually no road signs . But at precisely the correct spot , there is a giant tire , probably from an earth mover . Some traveler with a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circle . "
