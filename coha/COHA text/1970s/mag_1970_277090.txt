Whatever the Senate 's vote this week on the controversial nomination of G. Harrold Carswell , President Nixon is determined to appoint men to the Supreme Court who are " strict constructionists . " Since he will probably have the chance to choose several more Justices , what might that ill-defined term come to mean in the 1970s ? <P> Seven months of activity by Nixon 's first strict constructionist appointee , Chief Justice Warren E. Burger , are beginning to provide some answers . Burger would prefer to have the court take a less active role than it did during the Warren years , assume a low profile , and keep hands off more decisions of other branches of Government . <P> Ironically , Burger 's respect for precedent has at least once confounded the Nixon Administration . Last fall he joined a unanimous bench in applying previous holdings of the Warren court and in ordering Mississippi schools to desegregate " at once . " Indeed , Burger has not seemed anxious to lead a major retrenchment from most of the Warren court 's stands . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burger court " might take new positions on a wide range of topics . Among them : <P> RACE . Burger has lately voiced some doubts about the court 's summary handling of recent school integration cases . In January , he and Justice Potter Stewart added to one decision a " memorandum " suggesting that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals might well have been allowed to interpret the meaning of " at once " in the light of " the various situations of the several school districts . " A Burger concurring opinion to another decision became an important part of Nixon 's desegregation message three weeks ago . Burger urged the court to take future school cases that could " resolve some of the basic practical problems " of its past rulings , " including whether , as a constitutional matter , any particular racial balance must be achieved in the schools ; to what extent school districts and zones may or must be altered ; to what extent transportation may or must be provided . " <P> WELFARE . A five-man majority recently ruled that welfare recipients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Burger 's dissent typified his view that the court should not intervene when other parts of Government have recently acted . Arguing that regulations going into effect this summer will give welfare clients the same rights as the court ruling , Burger rapped the majority 's action as " another manifestation of the now-familiar constitutionalizing syndrome : once some presumed flaw is observed , the court then eagerly accepts the invitation to find a constitutionally ' rooted ' remedy . We ought to allow evolutionary processes at various administrative levels to experiment . " <P> LABOR . As Burger sees it , the Warren court went too far in putting most picketing and other union activity beyond the reach of state courts . In 1959 the court made it clear that the National Labor Relations Board was the proper body to deal with such matters . When the court recently used that doctrine to reverse a Florida state court 's ban on picketing for higher wages , Burger joined Justices Stewart and Byron White in a separate concurring opinion urging reconsideration of the Warren court 's rule .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
