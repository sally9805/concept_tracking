THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IATELY , writers , directors , and producers in virtually every me- 4 dium of communication have been experimenting with new ways of mingling fact and fiction . In the field of books , the most prominent current practitioner may be E. L. Doctorow , the author of " Ragtime , " who introduces historical characters into his story and then has them say things that they did not say and do things that they did not do . On television , the mingling has taken the form of " dramatizations " of real events . In a dramatization , the known events of the historical record are filled out with material that is invented by the television writers . In some cases , as in " The Adams Chronicles , " words are put in the mouths of historical figures . In other cases , as in " The Missiles of October , " a dramatization of the Cuban missile crisis , the actors virtually impersonate the historical figures , and at least some of the words they speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken . In either case , the elements that television is able to add  --  the new words , the new situations , the gestures , the facial expressions  --  are made up . The special appeal of the dramatizations lies in the apparent opportunity they afford to " actually see " historical figures in action , but the elements of the production which lend the impression of actuality are precisely those that are fictitious , A recent film in the disaster genre , " The Hindenburg , " has mixed the imaginary and the real in a slightly different way . At the moment when the audience expects to see a spectacular reenactment of the incineration of the Hindenburg and its passengers , the director instead shows  --  intercut with fictional footage -- newsreel footage of the actual incineration of the Hindenburg . Instead of embellishing fact with fiction , he attempts to embellish fiction with fact , and the result is that the audience is invited to be entertained by a real disaster . In an atmosphere in which people are asked to regard fictional movies as though they were real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be surprising that people are beginning to show signs of regarding real events  --  things happening to them or around them  --  as though they were movies . The recent financial crisis of New York City is one of many such events that come to mind . The treatment of the crisis in the news media was distinctly in the new disaster mode . The commonest depiction of the situation was a cartoon drawing of skyscrapers toppling over  --  a representation that was strongly reminiscent of the advertisements for the film " Earthquake " but had nothing to do with what was going on in the city . Until the very end , the public responses , too  --  the drawing up of sides , the stereotype of New York as sinful villain or virtuous hero , the indifference to the real economic consequences for the nation  --  were more those of an audience at a play than those of dtizens watching the approach of a catastrophe that could seriously disrupt the lives of alI of them . The members of the public , for a moment , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events in their own lives . ? ? Dawn THE theme of the 1976 Greater New York Automobile Show , at the Coliseum last week , was , according to the people working to promote the show , " Dawn of the New Automobile Era . " " New York City is the one location the world 's automotive industry is betting on for its long overdue recovery , " one of the publicity releases said . Other descriptive phrases for the " Dawn of the New Automobile Era " included " a now totally-mobilized industry , " " this Bicentennial year which is also a vital turning point for the auto industry , " and " a car market that 's no longer in the doldrums , " and there were also the statements " Luxury in automobiles is rising again from the ashes of 1974 and 1975 sales years " and " Sales figures for 1976 and early returns for 1976 indicate that the Bicentennial Year will he the Year of the Luxury Compact . " Using these proclamations as a guide , we took a brief look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the show advised us to keep our sights strictly on the future . " Do n't look back at cars like the Bricklin , " he said . " The Bricklin made its auto-show debut as a new car last year . It was the star of the show . Big star . Big bomb . It had these two hydraulically operated gull-wing doors that pulled straight up to open . Only sometimes you sat and sat waiting for them to open . You wo n't see the Brickfin here this time . " The same man steered us to this year 's stars . " Compact Luxury , " he said . " They stand for fuel economy . " We picked the Cadillac Seville to sit in for a taste of Compact Luxury . The car was a rich chocolate brown ( Chesterfield brown , according to Cadillac ) outside , and it had nice beige leather seats . It looked a great deal like the four-door Mercedes sedan . Very restful . Through its windows , of " Soft-Ray glass , " we could see and hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in long evening gowns and Iots of makeup stationed at the sides of Fords , Chevrolets , Buicks , and so on  --  giving her little talk into a hand-held mike . " The last of a magnificent breed , " she was saying about her cream-colored Cadillac Eldorado convertible , which looked enticing , but we stayed in the chocolate-brown Seville , where we were joined by Gus Leconte , the manager of the Cadillac Display . " That one is sold as of half an hour ago , " said Mr. Leconte , a compact , economical-looking gentleman with a rasping voice . He meant the Eldorado . " Our biggest cry is we do n't have enough stock . Demand is getting stronger than supply . " " Does Mercedes object to this one ? " we asked . " Why not ? " said Mr. Leconte , looking proud . " But we have two Sevilles . One with , one without the Astroroof  --  an eight-eighty-five option . " " How much without the Astroroof ? " we asked . " Without any options , twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Leconte said . We sat in several other Luxury Compact cars . They had names like Dodge Aspen , Plymouth Volare , Pontiac Sunbird , and Buick Skyhawk , and they all felt great . To a man , the people in charge of them told us that all these cars were Luxury , all were Compact , all were little on the outside but big on the inside , and all were economy cars only at the gas station . Even the Alfa Romeo people had " fuel-stingy " models , called the Alfetta sedan , the Alfetta GT ( sporty ) , and the Alfa Romeo 2000 Spider Veloce ( even sportier ) . " Miles per gallon , " an Alfa Romeo man said sombrely as he handed us a heavy packet of Alfa Romeo brochures ? ? and photographs that would take until the next auto show to mull over . " M.P.G. is the big selling point . " We sat for a while on a strip of what felt like wax grass beside the turntable for the 1976 Ford Granada , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body side stripes . " Every hour on the hour , it turned out , Ford held a drawing for a prize at the Granada turntable . Prize : a Pinto wristwatch . We made a quick check around . There were more different prize-entry forms to fill out and more prizes to win in drawings at the show than there were automobiles . In addition to the wristwatches , the prizes included flashlights , power tools , Jack LaLanne Health Spa memberships , razors , a motorcycle , a motor scooter , at least one car , fire extinguishers , vacations at Holiday Inns , Veedol Motor Oil , driving glasses , electric bicycles , picnic baskets , a sailboat , knit hats with matching scarves , and a player piano . " This is more than a show , this is a big opportunity , " an Oldsmobile man said to us , handing us a form to fill out headed " Win a Special-Edition ' 76 Olds Cutlass ! " We watched a couple of nine-year-old boys put their own toy Corgi cars on a couple of turntables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the toys and the big cars with equal interest . On our way out , we passed the Chevrolet giveaway . A young man stood beside the Caprice on its turntable . He was facing a couple of dozen visitors to the auto show , and he held a lock and three keys dangling on separate strings in one hand ; in the other was a brand-new five-dollar bill encased in a see-through plastic case . " Guess which of the three keys opens the lock , and you win the money , " the young man was saying , in a fairly successful imitation of a carnival barker . Founding Fathers THE United States was discovered and colonized by Prince Madog ab Owain Gwynedd , of what is now Wales , who arrived in Mobile Bay in his ship the Gwennan Gorn with three hundred men in 1170 , well ahead of Captain Farragut , who did n't get there until 1864 , when he steamed up to confront the Confederate fleet and cried " Damn the torpedoes ! " Columbus came somewhere between the two , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter . In 1610 , a Welsh colony was set up in Newfoundland , and in 1735 someone returning to England from North America reported in The Gentleman 's Magazine that he had encountered a tribe of Welsh-speaking Indians , to whom he had preached two sermons a day in Welsh for a fortnight . In 1793 , the Welshman John Evans set out for the Mississippi River in search of the Welsh-speaking Indians on an expedition equipped by the Spanish governor of New Orleans . In the Dakotas , he came upon the Mandan Indians , who , to his sad consternation , were interested only in juicy fertility rites and would not respond to a single word of Welsh . Sadly , he slipped back down the river . He died shortly thereafter , but his charts and notes were sold by Napoleon , along with Louisiana , to Jefferson , himself a Welshman , who later gave them to Lewis and Clark for their expedition . In 1778 , Dr. Richard Price , a - Welshman , was made an honorary citizen of the United States for suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was signed by seventeen Welshmen . There is still a Welsh colony in Patagonia , and the Welsh-speaking Indians were last heard of in British Columbia . All this peculiar information emerged last week when , in the company of our good pat the old curmudgeon , we called on Wynford Vaughan-Thomas , the Welsh Bicentennial Ambassador to the United States , in his digs at the Drake Hotel , at the beginning of his tour of the United States and Canada to invite all Americans to visit " the land of their Founding Fathers " in 1976 . The old curmudgeon maintains that he discovered America , in 1904 , when he arrived from Liverpool aboard the White Star liner Cymric , whose name derived from the Welsh name for Wales . Mr. Vaughan-Thomas , who is the Executive Director of Programs of the commercial television network in Wales when he is not showing the flag abroad , is sixty-seven and looks only two-thirds of it . He is a cheerful and outgoing man . The curmudgeon , who is neither , asked him if he represented all of Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he knew about the secessionists . " I was going down to Wales one afternoon several years ago on the South Wales Pullman for a dinner at the Cardiff City Football Club , " the o.c. said , " when my train was halted for forty-five minutes at a bridge while some Royal Engineers sappers disarmed a large bomb . " " Oh , " said Mr. Vaughan - Thomas . " Well , that was the only incident , and it was the I.R.A . " " When , as a visiting American , " continued the curmudgeon , " I get on a bus at Carmarthen to go to Cardigan and ask the driver how long the journey will be , all the people in the bus , who have been speaking English , start speaking Welsh . " " We 've been at war with the English ever since we drove out the Roman legions , " Vaughan-Thomas said . " What do you do when you get on a bus ? " said the curmudge . " I speak Welsh . " Vaughan - Thom as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he visits Wales every summer and especially likes the country around Brecon , in the mountains . " But what , " he asked , " is there to be said for Welsh country cuisine ? " " Have you dined in Miami ? " said Vaughan-Thomas , pouring him a cup of coffee . The two did agree on the merits of the Golden Linn inn in DOIgelley , as the English spell it , or Dolgellau , as the Welsh spell it . " Another example of the war between the Welsh and the English , " said Vaughan-Thomas . He went on , " Dylan Thomas and I grew up together in Swansea , where his father was our English master  --  a formidable disciplinarian . How did Dylan ever get through school ? He persuaded me one day not to go to French class , which he hated . ' Let 's go into the town and play billiards , ' he said . As we stole past the headmaster 's study , he popped his head out thc window and asked us where we were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said when Dylan told him . ' I hope you get caught . ' Oh , that wonderful voice of Dylan 's ! It was n't his original voice at all . He did n't have it until he came hack from reading his poetry in London for the first time . But the English , when they recite poetry , always seem to be apologizing for it . They have the most wonderful language , mind you , but they should n't be allowed to speak it . " Bells and Drells WE recently got an early-morning phone call from our friend Weldon Arthur McDougal III . He is the energetic promo man for Philadelphia International Records , the Philadelphia-based , black-owned record company , and he reminded us that once in a conversation with him we had said that , along with Brenda and the Tabulations , Jay and the Techniques , anti Martha and the Vandellas , Archie Bell and the Drells , the black singers from Houston , Texas , had the best name for a singing group , and that their two hit songs from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't Stop Dancing , " had remained in the hest-for-dancing category . " Well , " McDougal said , " Archie Bell and the Drells are now with us . They have a new album , and I 'm bringing them to town tomorrow to meet New York , and then I 'm throwing a party for them at Leviticus . " At noon the next day , with McDougal , we hopped over to the Statler Hilton hotel , where Archie Bell the Drells were staying , to get a daylong view of them . McDougal , who was dressed from head to foot in black , introduced us around  --  first to Archie Bell and then to Willie Parnell , James Wise , and Lee Bell ( Archie 's brother ) , who make up the Drells . When we were introduced to Archie Bell , he said " Hey , what 's happening , ai n't nothing to it " in one breath . Later , we learned that this is his favorite way of greeting people . We focussed on Archie Bell , because the Drells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a collection of patchwork-denim and polyester outfits , Archie Bell was wearing a smart-looking leisure suit . It was beige , with deep-brown stripes running down the pants legs , and the jacket had darts and tucks that made it fit snugly . After telling us how glad he was to be in New York , he said , " I would like to mention that we have one of the finest tailors in the country . He 's from Houston , Texas , and his name is Johnny Burton . He makes clothes for people like the Temptations and James Brown . He made this suit I am wearing , and he made the suits we are wearing on our album cover  --  the ones with the little bells all over them . " ' Then Archie Bell said , " We have been waiting so long to come back . When I had those hit songs ' Tighten Up ' and ' I Ca n't Stop Dancing , ' I was in the Army , so I could n't do any entertaining . When I got out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working since we were in high school . We lived in the same neighborhood and went to the same high school . My brother Lee joined the group in 1969 . But all the time we did n't have any hits we were working . We 've been on the road for three hundred and twenty days out of a year . Sometimes three hundred and fifty . We worked the South a lot . My mother always told us that we could do anything . She has seven children , all of them boys . You ever heard of Ricky Bell ? He is a top college football player , and he is my brother . " At a quarter to one , McDougal , who had been busy all this time taking pictures , announced that it was time to make the first stop . The first stop was an autographing session at the record store Disc-O-Mat , which was a few blocks away from the hotel , and for the next nine hours this is what Archie Bell and the Drells did : At Disc-0- Mat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity stills , and Archie Bell also autographed pictures of Ricky Bell . At a quarter past two , they went to Leviticus for rehearsal . At four o'clock , they left Leviticus and taxied up to the midtown offices of Cash Box , the music trade magazine , for an interview with a young reporter , who asked them questions like " Do your producers make you feel comfortable in the studio ? " and " I 'll confess that I 'm a little ignorant about what you guys have been up to , so how about if we kind of clear this up ? " On their way out , they met Steve Ostrow , the man who compiles the weekly album charts for Cash Box , and he told them that their new album had just debuted on the charts at No. 183 . At five o'clock , the Drells took a taxi to their hotel , and Archie Bell went off to a Nunn Bush shoe store to buy a pair of shoes . At half past six , they were back at Leviticus for the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were lots of black people at Leviticus . There were even some easily recognizable black people there . We picked out Lou Rawls , the singer ; David Ruffin , the former lead singer of the Temptations ; Don Covay , the important R. &; B. singer from the sixties ; and Harold Melvin , of Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes . At eight o'clock , Archie Bell and the Drells disappeared into the dressing rooms at Leviticus to change into their show clothes . At half past eight  --  show time  --  they reappeared , and they were quite incredible to see . They were wearing identical white skin-tight jumpsuits that had gold studs and brown bells running down the sides , and tight-fitting white bolero jackets over the jumpsuits , and white platform shoes . They sang most of the songs from their new album , plus " Tighten Up " and " I Ca n't Stop Dancing . " The audience was very pleased , and cheered and danced . Archie Bell was very pleased . He said to us , " I could do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , New Yorkers went through a spell of weather so cold that it had the local press and television stations reporting that the big story in town was the weather . On the memorable morning when the temperature dropped below zero and the city became colder than it had been in eight years , wintry clichj-s assaulted us from every quarter . Frigid winds " punished , " the mercury " plummeted , " the metropolitan region " shivA21164 ( iiiith ( 4 FE1311.1.1ARY 91 19 7 G ered in the grip of an Arctic air mass , " and -- our favorite ? " the metabolism of city and suburban life slowed perceptibly . " The star attraction in this vignette was , of course , the awesome windchill factor . We have done a bit of research into the canonization of the windchill factor , and have learned that during and shortly after the Second World War the Quartermaster Corps and the Medical Research Laboratory of the United States Army conducted some tricky experiments in which they placed live volunteers inside large refrigerators , adjusted the temperatures to troubling extremes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how their mortal flesh reacted . Depending upon the temperature and the wind speed , the flesh reacted from badly to worse , and when the Army had run enough of these tests it came up with a logarithmic formula  --  based in part on work done earlier by Dr. Paul Siple in the Antarctic  --  that is what we now know as the windchill factor . According to this formula , when the temperature is minus ten and no wind blows , the ternperature feels like minus ten . But when it is minus ten and the wind blows at thirty miles per hour , minus ten feels like minus sixty-four . And so forth . Eyeballs glaze over , penguins weep . The windchill factor tells people who already know that it is absurdly cold outside exactly how miserable they should feel . It can be a valuable conversation piece in an elevator , but that , we think , is the limit of its usefulness . At seven-thirty on the fabled subzero morning , when the temperature officially hit one below , a newsman on one local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like thirty-four below outside . Armed with that information , we switched stations just in time to hear another announcer agree that it was one below but maintain that it really felt like minus fifty . Sixteen degrees just by changing stations ! This sort of thing illustrates the versatility of the windchill factor , and it raises the ultimate question about it , which is " Says who ? " The other day , we made the rounds with Dr. Frank Field , the meteorologist , to find out just how he arrives at WNBC-TV 's version of the windchill factor . Three times a day , Dr. Field , whose office is on the seventh floor of the RCA Building , drops by the National Weather Service office , which is on the mezzanine floor of the RCA Building , and gathers the information he needs for his evening weather reports . The National Weather Service has about twenty Teletype machines , and they also keep gauges somewhere . Dr. Field rarely bothers with the gauges . In the " NewsCenter 4 " television studio he has a radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his data from Irving Pullman and Stanley Krowka , down on the mezzanine floor , who operate the terminals that print out information gathered by the National Weather Service and stored in a computer in Suitland , Maryland . If , on a given day , Dr. Field is interested in the windchill factor , Krowka and Pullman tell him what it is . Dr. Field never has to run outside , lick his finger , and hold it up to feel the cold air rushing against it . What this means is that , assuming that at no time has New York City experienced a naturally windless minus-fifty degrees , we are at the mercy of the Army and its refrigerated human guinea pigs . In the same way , no one actually feels the temperature-humidity index , the warm-weather discom fort standard , which does for masochists in the summer what the windchill factor does for them in the winter . Dr. Field assured us that he never tries to " sell " his weather forecasts , and that he bothers to mention the windchill factor only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last thing we asked him was how anyone who broadcasts the windchill factor would ever really know what it feels like . Dr. Field said , " He would n't . " Line ONthe night of its opening , we walked through " Drawing Now , " the Museum of Modern Art 's major winter show , with Bernice Rose , the young curator who had put it together . No use to say that Mrs. Rose had " hung " the show ; " installations " are more the mood of the day , and Mrs. Rose showed us a number of drawings that had been applied directly to the wails of the museum , without benefit of mat , frame , or any of that . It is one purpose of the show , Mrs. Rose told us , to demonstrate that drawing is not necessarily a conservative medium  --  that drawing can stand on its own , and is not necessarily a preparation for something else  --  and she showed us a number of works that made her point . In the long , narrow corridor leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she showed us a drawing by Robert Morris , which had been done directly on the wall and on a long piece of paper on the floor ( now covered by Plexiglas ) , and which extended the length of the corridor and echoed the contours of the artist 's hands and feet . " He worked in powdered graphite and plate oil , " Mrs. Rose told us . " The work was timed . He put his hands and his bare feet into the medium and then walked along a section of wall for ten seconds or so , and then went hack for more of the medium . An assistant timed him . The sense of the piece is ' keep walking , ' which for a narrow corridor is extremely appropriate . And , of course , if you do keep walking you get to the rest of the show . " Mrs. Rose showed us the rest . Mrs. Rose has dark hair , and eyes that are penetrating and intelligent . She told us that the show bad been arranged to evoke a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the deliberative . In the Less deliberative galleries , we admired a series of Rauschenbergs illustrating Dante 's " Inferno , " a series of fantastic monuments conceived by Claes Oldenburg , and a portrait by David Hoduicy . In the slightly more deliberative galleries , we depended more heavily on Mrs. Rose . She showed us a work by Michael Heizer that had been sandblasted onto a glass window . Through the glass that Mr. Heizer had sandblasted we could see Fifty-fourth Street , and an Audi and a Volkswagen . We admired some titles  --  especially Bruce Nauman 's " My Last Name Extended Vertically 14 Times " ? and Mrs. Rose showed us an interesting piece done in wire and pencil by Richard Tuttle . Mr. Tuttle , Mrs. Rose explained , had drawn an irregular line with a pencil directly on the museum wall ( not far , in fact , from Michael Heizer 's sandblasted window ) , followed the line with a stifF piece of wire , and fastened the wire lightly to the wall . " You have the pencil line and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What could be more descriptive of drawing ? " There was an optional-black-tie dinner to celebrate the opening of " Drawing Now . " It is useful at parties at the Museum of Modern Art to ask people to come in dinner clothes , because the artists wo n't come in dinner clothes however much you ask , and then you can tell the artists from their patrons . We heard one good line , from a patron . " It 's not just quality , " this patron said . " It 's about quality . "
