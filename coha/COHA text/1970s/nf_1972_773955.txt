Such a statement , published early in the agency 's consideration of a proposed action , would inform the consumer of his stake in food quality decisions . It would promote consumer participation as well as education , . and it would institutionalize consideration of the consumer 's interest in the agency . As the cases above illustrate , the dynamic technology of the meat industry can be used to adulterate meat quality as well as enhance it . In the case of the gradual fattening of the hotdog , we saw how the technological reach of the meat industry can exceed the regulatory grasp of USDA when a strong consumer presence is lacking in the agency . Adulterated hotdogs are only one result of the meat industry 's excessive influence in USDA . It can also have profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the technology of meat processing have been paralleled by a revolution in the corporate structure of meat production . In this development , agribusiness has an interface with farmers at the supply end of the meat chain , rather than consumers at the retail end , and here it benefits from an advocacy gap even wider than with consumers . The following chapter discusses chicken farming in the Deep South . As we shall see , the problems of the poultry grower have a common cause with the problems of consumers , farm workers , and environmentalists when they confront this nation 's agricultural establishment : organized bargaining power is heavily weighted on the side of agribusiness. 5 Poultry Peonage Us folks in the chicken business are the only slaves left in this country . ? Crawford Smith , Alabama contract farmer The dirt-poor hill country of Northern Alabama was the scene of bizarre events in the spring of 1970 . Its poor white chicken farmers , rugged individualists to a man , had organized and were out on strike ? the first time for farmers anywhere in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffersonian agrarian values , walked picket lines before the gates of Pillsbury , Ralston-Purina , and the other food conglomerates which bought their chickens for processing . Equally unprecedented was the decision of federal meat inspectors in the chicken plants to honor the pickets and refuse to enter the plants . Strangest of all , truckloads of black industrial unionists from Birmingham arrived at one plant to cheer the farmers on . The locals swore that the ghosts of Tom Watson and the Populists could be seen dancing in the shadows , their dream of a labor-farmer coalition against the trusts come true at last . These events were stimulated by profound economic grievances which foreshadow problems for the consumer as well . A study by USDA economists recently reported that poultry growers in Northern Alabama work for an average of minus 36 cents an hour . They survive in the short run by living off the depreciation // on their houses and equipment or by going deeper into debt ; in the long run , they sell out to larger growers or go bankrupt . Their economic plight reflects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which buy their chickens . The concentration of meat production and marketing power in relatively few food conglomerates over the last two decades has not been matched by compensatory restructuring of consumer and farmer power . In dealing with the farmer suppliers at one end and the consumer at the other , Swift , Pillsbury , Ralston-Purina , Central Soya , and the other agribusiness giants still maintain a man-to-man contact with unorganized individuals . The unequal relationship encourages - an irresponsible marketing power which permits the corporation to pass the costs of its mistakes and excessive profit margins either forward to the consumer or backward to the supplier . This imbalance assumes classic proportions in the chicken country of the Deep South . The corporations see nothing improper in their refusal to deal with debt-ridden farmers except as individuals . The Operations Manager of the Pillsbury Company , after refusing to meet with a grower 's association , explained : Our position continues to be that we will gladly meet with any grower on an individual basis to discuss problems , complaints , or questions . . . .2 A Wisconsin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : What farmer would want to buck up against a big corporation to fight for his rights , with probably $18 in his checking account , against a staff of twenty-five attorneys , to which money does n't mean anything . How can a small farmer compete in this situation ? 3 The infiltration of the corporate state into agriculture is having a profound effect on the economic and social relationships of rural America . As large integrated companies move in , they force more and more family farmers to lose their independent status and become , in effect , organization men in overalls . Large corporaPoultry // tions have recently moved into cattle ranching , cotton growing , orcharding , and other kinds of farming . Dow Chemical now grows catfish in Texas ; Purex is growing vegetables on thousands of acres in the Southwest ; American Cyanamid and John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company have a joint venture to grow corn , wheat , and soybeans on a 35,000 acre farm in North Carolina . Swift , Tenneco , Textron , Campbell Soups , Ralston-Purina , Pillsbury , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations of this size go into farming , they pull the whole agricultural establishment in their wake . Congressional committees and the federal farm bureaucracy become more attuned to the interests of corporate agribusiness and less sensitive to the needs of small farmers , the rural poor , and the consumer . The corporatization of agriculture has been more rapid in the chicken industry than anywhere else . The chicken farmers of Mississippi , Georgia , Alabama , and Arkansas provide a melancholy model of what the new industrial state may hold in store for rural people . For readers of Southern fiction , this has a special irony . The chicken farmer , while he often cuts a ludicrous figure , was at least his own man farming his own land . He grew chickens in a back lot , fattened them with diets of home-grown cornmeal and mush and sold them at auction at the county market when he was ready . As late as 1959 , nearly 60 percent of all broilers were still grown by independent farmers and then purchased in the open market by large processors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . Over 98 percent of all chickens are now produced under contract to large integrated corporations . In contract farming , the corporation contracts for use of the farmer 's land and its production resources . The corporation provides inputs such as seeds , feeds , medicines , and chicks or other livestock while the grower supplies the land , labor , and management . In this system , the corporation gains many of the advantages of family farming ( primarily cheap labor ) without taking from the farmer the costs and risks of capital ownership . The farmer sells the commodities directly to the 104 packer or processor at a fixed price agreed on in advance . The farmer is , in effect , paid as a wage laborer on a piecework basis . In ten years from 1954 to 1964 , the broiler industry went from 3 to 98 percent integrator controlled . Mergers of processing and slaughtering firms increased at a rate of 41 percent during the four years 1960 ? 1964.4 As a result , the open market , the traditional cushion between the farmer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer protected by competitive bidding in the marketplace . If a farmer wants to sell chicken , he must sell to a corporation through a contract with a fixed formula price or not at all . There is still an open market for hogs and cattle but it too may succumb to contract agriculture , as Swift and other companies increasingly buy fed cattle directly from the feedlot at a fixed price . The American Agricultural Marketing Association estimates that 50 percent of American food will be produced by farmers under contract to corporations in 1970 ? 1980 and that within fif- , teen years , 75 percent of agricultural production and marketing will be cornered by contracts.5 Until the early fifties , the chicken industry was fragmented with hatcheries , feed companies , growers , and processors all operating more or less separately . Gradually , large companies began to integrate these elements . Feed companies like Ralston-Purina and Pillsbury integrated forward to develop markets for their feeds , while poultry processors integrated backward as a means of controlling costs . Eventually the largest companies absorbed all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds . The " integrators " found it more profitable to contract with independent farmers to do that . In broiler integration , therefore , the big companies grow the feed , hatch the chicks , and slaughter and process the mature birds . The farmer furnishes his land , building , equipment , and labor to feed the chickens for eight weeks until they grow to marketable weight of three and a half pounds . On one level , the integrated chicken industry is the great success story of American agriculture . Before World War II , chicken was still a seasonal dish . Families looked forward to " spring chicken , " a by-product // of the spring hatch from farm flocks of layers . As demand increased , a few producers began raising chick-ens not as egg producers but as fryers for the market . Spurred on by World War II , when people turned to chicken while other meat was scarce , broiler produc tion climbed steeply after the Depression . From 1939 to 1958 , poultry sales increased an average of 14 percent each year.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 310 million in 1947 . The American who ate eighteen pounds of chicken a year in 1940 , consumed thirty-nine pounds a year in 1969 . Market specialists estimate that he will consume forty-five to fifty pounds by 1980 . As a result of rapid technological development in genetics , feeds , animal drugs , and economies of scale , the price of chicken has actually declined as consump tion has gone up . In 1950 , broilers cost the consumer $0.60 a pound ; in 1970 the price was $0.42 a pound . The price received by the grower has plummeted from $0.29 to $0.15 a pound in the same period.7 It is impor tant to note that while retail prices declined 33 percent , payments to growers declined nearly 50 percent . Retail prices for beef , by comparison , have increased from $0.67 a pound in 1955 to nearly $1.00 in 1969 . The farmer has stayed in business by increasing the efficiency of the process by which chickens convert feed into meat . No animal surpasses the chicken as a meat factory . While it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beef , it takes only 2.4 pounds* to produce a pound of chicken , down from four or five pounds in 1950 . The time needed to grow a broiler to market weight has also declined , from ten to twelve weeks in 1950 to eight to nine weeks in 1969.9 The chickens themselves have become computerized units in a factory environment . The chicken which used to run free to scratch and root in the soil until time for slaughter , now spends its short life in a 12 " by 18 " cage crowded up against three other birds . His day may consist of sixteen hours of artificial light in a totally programmed environment . Crowding favors disease by creating stress and aiding the buildup of // harmful bacteria and parasites , such as coccidia . The chicken 's feed , therefore , is sprinkled with antibiotic drugs . Other drugs , including arsenic and antibiotics , such as nitrofurans , are fed to increase the rate at which the chicken matures and gains weight . Before going to market , chickens may also be bathed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shelf life . In addition , the birds ' chemical diet may con tain coloring additives to give their flesh a desired yellowish tint . They are also sprayed regularly with pesticides . With this medicine chest of ready chemicals , the poultryman can cheat on sanitation without suffer ing severe flock losses , but at the risk of chemical con tamination of the final product . Stress also induces cannibalism . Chickens are , therefore , debeaked to keep them from destroying their neighbors , 10 and in some cases given tranquilizers . One indication of how far the chicken industry has come from the barnyard is the development of what must be one of the world 's most exotic and highly-specialized professions : chicken sexing . For economic reasons , chicks must be segregated by sex at birth . Chicken genitalia being what they are , it is virtually impossible for the untrained eye to distinguish the sex of a day-old chick . But in 1925 , the Japanese discovered some telltale sign of sex in the chick 's anatomy which they jealously guarded as a trade secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without its chicken sexor imported from Japan . The best can sort 800 ? 1040 baby chicks an hour . The Japanese sexors have recently founded the American Sexing School in Lansdale , Pennsylvania , and will let anyone in on their secret for $1300 and an eighteen-week course . To keep their pro fessional standards high , they have , in the best Ameri can tradition , formed the American Chicken Sexing Association . The technical sophistication of chicken growing , // especially in disease control , gives an impetus to concen-tration in the industry . According to Dr. Philip Raup , Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Minnesota , one of the determinants of the most effective size of firm in poultry production and beef feeding is a scale of operations large enough to support a resident veterinarian . " Without expert advice , the typical farmer can not develop the skills to use chemical technology effectively . Much of the effort at farmer education in the use of feed additives , farm chemicals , and drugs is conducted by private companies who pre-fer to concentrate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce this technology has outrun efforts to distribute it in packages useful for the small farmer . He blames the Federal Extension Service and agricul-tural experiment stations for the failure to develop an effective extension program in animal health . ' ? The pyramiding of economic power in the chicken industry has created a vicious marketing system which can be turned against the consumer as well as the farmer . Up to now , many of the benefits of cost-reduc-ing technology have been passed on to the consumer . But as concentration increases , this may cease . The history of concentration in other industries ? the making of automobiles is a classic example ? shows that when a few firms dominate the production field , many of the rewards of technological advance are captured by the firms and not passed on . At the same time , a techno-logical rigor mortis may set in as the firms , freed of competitive pressure in pricing , devote more energy to corporate risk-reduction than to product improvement . In the chicken business , Pillsbury , Swift , and Holly Farms may soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breakfast food makers ? by using adver-tising to create the illusion of differentiation in essen-tially similar products . The advertising costs to create the image of " brand name " poultry will be passed on to the consumer.13 The Pillsbury chicken may soon rival the NBC peacock as the nation 's most ubiquitous TV fowl . Thus far , however , the full weight of the food con-glomerates ' market power has been turned toward the supplier , not the consumer . // An Honest Day 's Pay Despite the broiler industry 's modernization and growth , the growers have not shared in its prosperity . Of all the links in the chain of chicken production , the actual growing of chickens has the lowest profit margins . As one observer noted : " If the growing of chicks were profitable , it would have been integrated long ago . " This situation exists because the relationship between the farmer and the companies is so extremely one-sided . Even though the farmer has invested nearly 50 percent of his industry 's capital , he is hardly an equal partner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price . Companies deny that they stake out exclusive claims for specific territories , but the fact is that with the exception of Gainesville , Georgia , and a few other areas , many growers face local monopoly situations where there is only one company to deal with.14 The contract price from company to company varies very little . Usually the contract is drafted by the company and presented to the grower on a take it or leave it basis . One California grower , in a letter to Congressman B. F. Sisk ( D.-Cal. ) in October , 1971 , described contract bargaining : . . . in today 's market , the grower dare not bargain for decent pay lest he be cut off by the integrator ; his mortgage , land , home , and everything are threatened if he so much as asks for a better deal than these phony contracts which are not contracts at all but merely unilateral work rules imposed from on high . In 1969-1970 , the grower received between one and three-fourth cents and two cents per pound for birds he raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point for the average grower is $0.0229 per pound . Robert Troy , a skilled observer of the Southern poultry scene , gave this description of the economic plight of one Alabama grower , a Mr. Thurmond Banks , who grows chickens for Spring Valley Farms in Empire , Alabama : For eighty-four days Mr. Banks and his family fed , watered , housed , and looked after 22,500 chickens . Mr. Banks // estimated his total labor at a minimum of 588 hours . His gross receipts minus direct cost yielded him a net of $317.67 , which works out to be $0.25 an hour for his investment of labor and capital . But depreciation and tax costs , which the grower rarely takes into account , would come to about $370.00 on his equipment . Thus Mr. Banks and his family were actually making about minus $0.08 an hour , which would be a windfall if the negative income tax were enacted . 1 ? 5 Many growers are not sophisticated enough in budgeting to realize that a year 's net cash flow , without deductions for fixed costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor measure of income . There is a story about a lady chicken grower who was asked by a labor organizer how she was doing with her chickens . " Great , " she said . The surprised organizer then asked if she had figured out her direct and indirect expenses . " Lord no , " she answered . " I would n't have nothing then . " 16 The fact is that most growers have been working for almost nothing.17 The Economic Research Service of USDA has estimated that poultry farmers in Georgia earned only $0.53 an hour for their labor in 1952 , and that income then declined in the next decade to reach a low of $0.01 per hour in 1964 . They rebounded to $0.54 an hour in 1965.18 Testimony in Senate hearings on the Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 showed that many growers were forced to live off their depreciation . Conditions have not improved much since . These dismal figures are not confined to the South . Congressman Sisk of California recently estimated that California growers receive an average of $0.30 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contract farming to the integrator is that it allows them , in effect , to hire workers while legally evading the minimum wage laws . 1969 was a record year and yet the net return to the average farmer was approximately $2,000 per year , a three-fold improvement since 1960-64 , but an income which still puts him well below the poverty line.19 ( These figures do not include depreciation and interest payments . They were figured on the very unlikely 1 10 SOWING THE WIND assumption that the farmers were debt free . ) This represented total farm income for broiler growers and was calculated at $0.021 per pound of broilers sold . An Alabama study of cash flow budgets for broiler growers found that a farmer with a 20,000 bird capac ity who produced three batches of broilers in 1969 , ended up $628 in the red , after payments on housing and equipment loans , depreciation , and other fixed costs were taken into account . If production was expanded to four and a half batches a year , the farmer came out ahead but just barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The return on the chickens themselves was only $90 ; he earned the other $800 by , selling the chicken 's manure.21 If the farm unit had a 45,000 bird capacity with four and a half batches a year , the total return was $2,000 per farm in spendable and nonspendable income , a modest return to say the least for a businessman with a $40,000 investment in housing and equipment alone . If manure sales and increases in net worth ? the non-spendable income ? are not included , the farm was over $4,700 in the red . When this example was cited before the Senate Agri-culture Committee in 1969 , spokesmen for the integra tors said it was unrealistic because it depreciated chicken houses over five years rather than ten.21 It is true that the growers ' profits improve with ten year depreciation . His average spendable income is now a " realistic " $374.62 for the year or $31 a month . He has 1 additional nonspendable income of $1,800 from 360 tons of manure.22 Whether the depreciation is figured at five or ten years , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally chicken shit. ? The integrators fare differently , to say the least . James Finlayson , a leading poultry consultant for Pillsbury , estimates that on a five year average , pubPoultry // licly held companies essentially in the broiler business , can average 23 ? 24 percent return on invested capital before taxes each year.23 The chicken farmer is convinced that his small profits are caused as much by the way they are calculated by the integrator as by market conditions . Here the grower has been totally at the mercy of the integrator . The National Broiler Council , the major association of integrators , publishes a code of ethics which states that its members should give the grower a written contract with full documents on his flock , showing the amount of feed used , the condemnation rate , the weight and number of birds slaughtered , and a settlement sheet giving the calculations used in reaching payment . The only problem with the Code of Ethics is that few integrators have observed it.24 From the beginning of his association with the integrator , the grower is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Noblin , President of Scott County Farm Bureau in Forest , Mississippi : There are no broiler contracts in this area . Integrators simply give the producer a sheet showing what would be paid per pound , based on the feed conversion . The terms of the socalled contracts are not discussed with the producer , nor is it signed by the integrator or producer.25 The Packers and Stockyards Administration of USDA reported in 1967 that the grower frequently did not know how many chickens the integrator brought to him , nor how many were eventually taken away , nor how much they weighed . Chickens are neither counted nor weighed at the farm . He has had to take the word of the company on all of these matters . The grower is not permitted to inspect the scales of the integrator . Frequently , he has been forbidden to see the USDA condemnation and grading certificates on the chickens he markets even though all condemned birds are charged to the grower.26 Growers are forced further into debt by the company 's requirement that they install expensive equipment such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving the chicks . Ralston-Purina in the mid-sixties would only contract with growers who agreed to a tie-in purchase of company equipment . 1 12 SOWING THE WIND During the National Food Marketing hearings in 1966 , a grower in East Texas testified that " Purina " made him buy a fan worth $19 at any 5 &1Oc/; store for $50 . The National Farmers Organization charges that the companies deliberately increase the growers ' indebtedness with these measures so they will be forced to take chickens at any price . The companies claim that their only interest is to improve the quality of the chicken houses and cut their losses . In many cases , the grower 's contract is so unequal that he has been compared to the sharecropper in both his status and his poverty . The difference in this version of that infamous relationship is that the bossman is an absentee landlord with a corporate , not a personal , identity whose " big house " is in a paneled board room in faraway Minneapolis or New York . Otherwise the analogy needs no explanation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who supplies him with his essentials to make a crop ( in this case , baby chicks , feed , and technical advice ) ; the field man collects the harvest ( eight-week-old chickens ) , measures the results ( he weighs the chickens , and sets the price ) , and decides what the cropper 's share ought to be . The cropper may even be forced to buy his supplies ( his broiler equipment ) from the company store . The corporate landlord keeps all the records . When results are totaled up , the poultry " cropper " often finds he has a bigger debt instead of a big payment , and is even more in thrall to his bossman than before . ' The poultry farmers have all the insecurities of an organization man and none of the fringe benefits . Thej farmers are not strictly employees of a corporation , and are therefore without retirement , medical benefits , a minimum wage protection . These farmers keep chicks in their houses only at the sufferance of the corporation . David H. Sloan , President of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The poultry producer in most cases has invested everything he has in the property , poultry houses , and equipment . He is at the mercy of the processor because he must have birds to grow or go broke . " 28 The grower also shares the psychological state of the sharecropper . The latter knew that he could be evicted if he complained ; the grower // knows that he can be cut off arbitrarily by the integrator and be left with no chickens to raise . A Georgia organizer for the National Farmers Organization used only mild hyperbole when he recently described the growers as " the last slaves to be freed in the South . " The Burn-Out Pillsbury , Arkansas Valley Industries , and the other integrators argue that the grower benefits from the contract system and that the system itself has nothing to do with his penury . It is true that in the fifties , contract farming appeared to be a great opportunity for the farmers . Production was centered in the depressed , rural counties of five Southern states , where there were many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . For many of these marginal farmers , raising chickens seemed to be the last chance to make money off their farms . The contracts promised to take all the risk out of chicken raising . The farmer on contract is somewhat protected from the fluctuations of the free market , but risks remain . Many growers have market related contracts and thus risk loss in a down market . They risk loss from condemnations which may not be their fault and from cutbacks during periods of overproduction ; they risk loss through damage to or obsolescence of their equipment . The integrators justify the growers ' economic plight by pleading their own poverty . In the words of John Yarbrough , the militantly pro-integrator publisher of the news weekly the Poultry Times : " Any grower who believes his integrator is making money today is not acquainted with the economic facts of the broiler business . " 23 The poultry industry was plagued with overproduction in 1970 ? 1972 and the broiler divisions of many large integrators lost money . But on a five-year average , as mentioned earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested capital , according to a leading poultry consultant . ( The cyclical nature of the business , rather than sustained low profits , has persuaded some conglomerates , Ralston-Purina for one , to get out of the business . ) In any case , the losses of the broiler divisions of food conglomerates are not // what they seem . Current tax laws permit diversified companies to deduct losses of one operation from the profits of unrelated or distantly related operations and substantially reduce their total tax load . An effort by poultry growers to prohibit the use of farm production losses as deductions from nonfarm production operations in tax calculations failed to win support in Senate hearings on corporation farming in 1968 . Moreover , in periods of overproduction , large feed manufacturers like Ralston-Purina can make up in profits from selling feed the losses they incur in processing chickens . One indication of the integrators ' financial strength is that they frequently increase their investment in the ' poultry industry during surplus crises . This was the case with the turkey industry in 1961 and 1967 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conglomerate goes into farming , profit should be the motive . However , we have seen such companies enter into or expand turkey operations during years where there was little or no profit potential . This leads one to feel that profit , for a specific year at least , is not the only motive.i0 Overcapacity is precisely what keeps the poultry farmer in peonage , for it robs him of any bargaining power he might have . In the South , the growers have a term for increases of production in a falling market . They call it a " burn-out . " Only the strongest independent growers survive , and they are far more vulnerable than before . The Packers and Stockyard Administration in 1967 accused the processors of using this strategy . It reported that integrators use get-rich-quick advertising campaigns to encourage farmers to build new facilities to grow chickens , even in times of surplus.31 Feed companies , for example , go into the chicken business primarily to create new markets for feed . They therefore have a vested interest in a chicken surplus . Chickens have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , while the farmer takes the brunt of loss from low chicken prices , feed sales boom . Each burn-out , however , leads to greater concentration of market power in few economic units . The farmers can not match the financial staying power of the integrators in a falling market . As their debts increase , they become more dependent on the contrac- // new legislation ? Or should the growers dispense with the old institutions and seek self-help through new institutions of their own making ? It is clearly an offense to democratic values that individual farmers should have to confront alone the full force of corporate power , but is the political system flexible enough to respond ? Here on the obscure stage of the chicken farm , one sees exaggerated in microcosm the plight of farm workers , consumers , textile workers , meat inspectors , and other groups left exposed to irresponsible corporate power by structural imbalances in the political and economic system . The federal agency with regulatory responsibility in the area of chicken farming is USDA 's Packers and Stockyards Administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1967 , it first brought the growers ' situation to national attention . Based on the uncompromising research of James D. Tuggle and Everett Stoddard , the report described the inequities of the contract system in merciless detail . Spurred by these revelations , Secretary of Agriculture Freeman pledged immediate investigation of any complaints of boycotting or other retaliation by contractors against farmers who joined cooperatives in an attempt to better their lot . " He also promised new regulations for growers ' contracts . The effect on the poultry industry was electric . The large integrators directed a barrage of criticism at Freeman and the Packers and Stockyards Administration . In September , 1967 , in an attempt to gain industrywide support , Freeman promised that no new regulations protecting the growers would be put into effect until they had been reviewed in advance by an advisory committee which included integrators and growers . " Thus began a long series of delay . Regulations giving the grower a more equal voice in negotiating contracts were not proposed until three years later in the fall of 1970 . At the request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were then further delayed . The regulations require : ( 1 ) a written contract which includes all significant details , including duration , termination and conditions , and payment terms ; // ( 2 ) settlement sheets with all information necessary to compute payments due to the grower ; ( 3 ) condemnation and grading certificates ; ( 4 ) grouping or ranking sheets which show the grower 's position vis-a-vis other growers during the settlement period . The regulations seem modest enough , by the standards of any other industry , but they are seen as a fundamental threat to the free enterprise system by some integrator spokesmen . John Yarbrough of the Poultry Times called Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng a " pseudodictator " when he signed the Federal Register notice of the regulations on January 23 , 1971 . He quoted a poultryman : " If the Secretary of Agriculture can require all of the things contained in the new Packers and Stockyards regulations , we are living in the wrong country . This is just like Russia . " 3r The regulations went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their enforcement and , therefore , remains to be tested . Up to November , 1971 , USDA had still initiated no formal proceedings against any integrator . The growers have luckily not waited for USDA to equalize their bargaining terms with the conglomerates . Out of desperation , they have cast aside the separatist ideology of the family farmer and organized in selfdefense . They recognized that the old cliches of individualism and economic independence , appropriate perhaps when an open market existed as a buffer between the farmer and the integrator , had now become luxuries they could not afford . The efforts of farmers to organize against the integrators have a long and often violent history . They began in 1961 with the formation of the Northwest Poultry Growers Association in Arkansas . Its best known leader was Ellis Hale , who with his wife and four children , raised 200,000 broilers a year in Scott County , south of Fort Smith . His efforts to organize growers were at first discouraged , and then actively opposed by Arkansas Valley Industries , Ralston-Purina , and Tysons Foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hale was successful with his message that farmers should stop living off the depreciation of their investment and earn a fair return . But in the spring of 1 18 SOWING THE WIND 1962 , the resistance of the integrators became more threatening . In May , when growers congregated at the Scott County Courthouse for one of Hale 's meetings , they got an ominous reception . As the farmers arrived , they found that Arkansas Valley Industries had cars and trucks parked strategically on the square around the courthouse , covering all its approaches . Company officials were sitting in the vehicles taking down the names of the growers as they passed by . During the meeting , a company truck with no muffler gunned its motor near the courthouse door , drowning out Hale 's words . In August , Arkansas Valley Industries canceled its contracts with Hale and his father and brother , all of whom were members of the Northwest Poultry Growers Association . Ralston-Purina and Tysons Foods joined AVI in boycotting all growers who had joined the association . Because of the blacklisting , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicks for their broiler houses and went bankrupt . The Hales filed a civil suit against the poultry companies in the hopes of recovering their losses , but when they could not put up the $10,000 necessary to prepare and present the case , their attorneys withdrew.38 After a lengthy investigation by the Packers and Stockyards Administration , the three integrators were ordered in 1968 to " cease and desist " their harassment of the growers . The order was subsequently overturned for lack of jurisdiction by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1969 . USDA has still not asked for legislation to give Packers and Stockyards jurisdiction in such j cases . Hale lost everything . The Arkansas case helped inspire new organizing efforts in other states . The holding action in Alabama in the spring of 1970 was organized by the National Farmers Organization , the most militant of the farm organizations which support the growers ' demands for collective bargaining . The NFO strike was marred by violence on both sides . Night riders roamed the lonely claytop roads of northern Alabama , burning the chicken houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired on , and there were fights on the picket lines . As one observer noted , there was " much violence , with neighbor turned against neighbor . The // wounds will not heal completely during this generation . " 39 The striking farmers refused to accept checks from the integrators . They demanded higher contract pay ments and the right to monitor the weighing and inspec tion of their birds . From the beginning , the companies refused to negotiate with the farmers ' representative . John Bagwell , the President of Spring Valley Foods in Cullman , Alabama , was asked by a reporter whether he would negotiate with the NFO . He gave a forthright response : I 'd rather be dead and in hell , than talk with W. O. Thomas the NFO local President . . . the day I talk to that bunch , I 'll call the reporters to Cullman and have W. O. Thomas pull down his britches and I 'll kiss him square on the ass.4 ? USDA , while officially an impartial observer of the strike , actually went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspectors refused to cross the NFO picket lines because of the violent atmos phere , the Inspector General investigated them , judged them to be AWOL , and deprived them of pay . All the inspectors received letters of reprimand from the Department . The Alabama Poultry Inspectors Local of the American Federation of Government Employees feels strongly that the investigation by the Office of the Inspector General was biased and unfair.41 There are also charges that the Farmers Home Administration has made reprisals against striking growers . T. H. House of Addison , Alabama , who has an FHA mortgage on his farm , was told by local FHA representatives that his farm would be " a-changing hands " if he did n't take chickens from the integrators.42 // The NFO holding action was temporarily stopped by an injunction on June 28 , 1970 , by the U.S. District Court for Northern Alabama . In July , 1971 , nearly a year later , the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans reversed the lower court , finding that the com-plaints of Ralston-Purina , Pillsbury , and twelve other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The court held that " the procedures followed by the plaintiffs in this case can not be sustained under any standard . " This decision is cold comfort for the NFO . The picket lines have vanished and some growers have returned to the companies , but the nine-county local is holding on . John Bagwell , President of Spring Valley Foods , boasts : " They 're whipped . We 've broken them . " He may be right . Many of the growers are in deep financial trouble . The lower court , in granting the pre-liminary injunction which broke the strike , required the fourteen corporations to put up only a $2,500 bond to compensate NFO members in the event that the injunc-tion was found to be " improvident . " NFO had asked for $1 million . Crawford Smith , one such grower , observes : It 's a hard row to hoe . All we 're asking is fair wages for a fair day 's work . . . . Seems like we just keep on losing ground.43 More recently , the American Agricultural Marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has organized growers against the Maple-wood Poultry Company in Belfast , Maine . The growers decided not to accept chicks after the integrator made contract changes which allegedly reduced the grower 's income by 20 percent . The AAMA has asked the Packers and Stockyards Administration to investigate threats and intimidation against growers . The growers have not as yet received much help from the Congressional arena . The Agricultural Fair Prac-tices Act , better known as S.109 , which was passed in 1967 , in practice has proved a triumph of form over substance . It promised to protect the grower against unfair trade practices such as boycotts , blacklists , con-tract cutoffs , and harassment . In November , 1971 , USDA filed its first suit against an integrator under the act . USDA charged that the Maplewood Poultry ComPoultry // pany mentioned above threatened to boycott farmers who complained about its contracts . Responsibility for administering the act was recently transferred from the Farmers Cooperative Service to the Consumer and Marketing Service , a move which , by putting it in a primarily marketing agency , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Consumer and Marketing Service has thus failed to give active support to investigation and prosecution under the act.44 Claude Gifford , an editor of the Farm Journal , the leading farm magazine , recently accused USDA of being slow in pressing cases for farmers.45 Two other bills , S.2225 , and a bill sponsored by Senator Walter Mondale ( D.-Wisc. ) go much further in defining and protecting the growers ' rights at the bargaining table . They would make the failure of an integrator to recognize a bargaining association an unfair labor practice . These bills are now pending . According to the National Broiler Council and other integrator spokesmen , these bills threaten the efficiency and lifeblood of the processing industry . On the contrary , the right to organize to protect occupational interests is a basic cornerstone of the free enterprise system . This kind of institution building is essential to give balance and fair play to the economic relationships of contract farming . The integrators ' attempt to invoke the ideology of economic independence and individuality to justify their attacks on growers ' organizations is particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to increase their own bargaining muscle through group action . Operating under the umbrella of the Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 , Ralston-Purina and other integrators have formed the National Broiler Marketing Association which now controls 35 ? 45 percent of the nation 's broilers.46 The Capper-Volstead Act was designed to allow small producers to legally collude in order to offset the power of large corporate buyers . It seems doubtful that its farmers wanted it to be used to allow large integrators and nonfarm processors to collude against the small farmer . Neither the Federal Trade Commission nor the Justice Department has challenged the legitimacy of the National Broiler Market122 SOWING THE WIND ing Association . Both have long been indifferent to the impact of corporate concentration on the small farmer . With the exception of the strong Packers and Stock-yards report in 1967 , USDA has been at best lukewarm to the attempts of growers to organize in their self-defense . Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng recently gave bargaining associations the weakest possible endorsement : " We are not intrinsically opposed to bargaining associations . " 47 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain-ing , and warns that the " rewards and incentives of the free market system must not be . . . unduly inhibited . " 48 Lyng is strangely silent , however , on the free-market implications of collusion among the integrators . One must conclude , therefore , that up to now USDA has failed this test of its responsiveness to the needs of small producers . ' More help may be forthcoming in Congress now that the National Farmers Union and the American Farm Bureau Federation have joined forces to support a strong bargaining bill . NFO prefers to go it alone with its collective bargaining strategy without government interference . These groups may force USDA to re-evaluate its relationship to farm bargaining . Defenders of the " corporate-integratee " system of agriculture , while conceding that low prices have pro-duced hard times for all branches of the poultry indus-try , argue that farmers and rural communities are still better off than if the integrators had not arrived on the scene . They make three basic points : ( 1 ) integrators allow farmers to stay on the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance and a stable market provided by the integrators ; ( 2 ) integrators provide jobs off the farm in processing , distribution , and marketing ; ( 3 ) integrators are more effi-cient and therefore reduce prices for the consumer . On the first point , it would be valuable to know more about the circumstances under which farmers become growers for an integrator , to see whether the alternative was in fact leaving farming altogether , and to see // whether total incomes in fact increased as a result of integration . In the integrated broiler industry of Northern Alabama , at least , it is abundantly clear that growers are making extremely low returns on their capital and labor . This experience suggests that collective bargaining and marketing associations are far more efficient than integration in protecting farm income . One problem is that even if the integrator does increase income for farmers in the short run , it tends to drive out small processors and other buyers for the farmers ' commodities , creating a quasi-monopoly situation . In other words , vertical integration often leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his contract price suddenly declining . Subsequently , if the integrator decides to shift its business elsewhere , in response to organizing efforts by farmers , for example , the growers are left in the lurch with no local markets for their chicken . Ralston-Purina 's plans to move out of the contract chicken business create this threat in some Southern localities . As for the off-the-farm jobs provided by the integrator , we need to know more about who gets these jobs , and what their wages and working conditions are . It is likely , however , that new bargaining institutions which keep ownership in the hands of farmers will have a more beneficial effect on the rural economy . This is true because small farms would keep profits in the area and at the same time avoid the effects of absentee ownership by integrators who may be more interested in low taxes than decent schools . It can not be assumed that lower costs to the consumer of a " corporate-integratee " produced commodity when they occur are the result of increased efficiency from integration alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? e.g. , improved feed conversions ratios ? have taken place at the farm level . Of course , when one firm runs the whole vertical chain , it is possible that it could reduce consumer prices by eliminating the " waste " profit of a series of middlemen . However , no firm is going to give up increased profits just for the consumer 's sake . For every middleman eliminated , who made perhaps a 5 percent profit , there is a service to he performed by the // new firm 's capital , on which it may earn a 10 percent return . If integration leads to significant market control , particularly when accompanied by horizontal concentration , higher prices for the consumer are the likely result . Unfortunately , corporate secrecy about the profits and losses of different operating divisions and products makes judgments about the relative efficiency of the integrators difficult . For the individual chicken farmer , therefore , the lesson is clear . The integrated corporations have come to the South and the other poultry areas to stay . As the corporate state advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in self-defense . The alternative is the neo-feudalism of northern Alabama . 6 Hidden Ingredients Federal regulation of meat and poultry is heavily biased toward the principle that what the consumer can not see can not hurt him . The plant inspector is primarily concerned with bruises , tumors , fecal contamination , enlarged livers , stray feathers ? defects which he can see , touch , or smell . But of far greater potential danger to the consumer 's health are the hidden contaminants : bacteria like salmonella and residues from the use of pesticides , nitrites , hormones , antibiotics , and other chemicals used in food production and processing . Here the inspection failures are more often errors of omission than commission . Monitoring meat for chemical residues has traditionally been limited to spot checks for a few compounds , often with analytical equipment either too insensitive or too time-consuming to catch contaminated meat before it reaches the consumer . There is no regular monitoring of salmonella or other microbiological contaminants in meat and poultry plants in the United States . Yet at least thirty diseases , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmissible to man through meat , milk , poultry , eggs , and other foods of animal origin . Changes in the technology of food processing have increased the risk of microbiological poisoning , as more fully processed foods are offered to the consumer and as the time span between processing and consumption continues to increase . The increased density of animal populations for both feeding and processing and the contamination of their environment have also increased the hazards . In the absence of microbial standards , strict // adherence to the sanitation rules set out in the USDA Inspectors Handbook reduces the spread of bacteria within the processing plant . But as we have seen , the inspectors who apply these rules on the production lines are sometimes not backed up in USDA when the plant managers complain , and even if they do get cooperation from USDA and the processor , the speed with which they must work weakens this front line of consumer defense . The hazards from chemical contaminants are both more serious and less easily controlled . With the possi-ble exception of a few stores specializing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy meat which is not contaminated to some degree with synthetic chem-ical residues . Between 80 and 90 percent of all beef and poultry produced in this country is grown on a diet of antibiotics and other drugs from birth to slaughter . Three-fourths of all cattle in the United States are fed stilbestrol and other growth-stimulating hormones . Pesti-cides enter the human food chain when meat animals eat contaminated feed and water or are directly sprayed to control parasites and insects . Both the FDA and the USDA keep watch on the levels of chemicals in food but the technology of residue monitoring , as well as budget allocations for this task , is inadequate . For example , there are several highly poisonous chemicals which may be present in meat at levels too small to be discovered by present screening devices but too large to be safely consumed . Carcino-genic compounds , such as stilbestrol and nitrosamines , and the tetra-dioxin contaminant of the herbicide 2,4,5-T , a potent agent of birth defects in test animals , are three chemicals in this category . The threat of chemical residues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry is another side effect of the rapid application of chemical tech-nology to agriculture . As with the use of pesticides on crops , the short-term effects on yields of hormones and antibiotics which increase the body weight of the animal are sometimes allowed to outweigh potential long-term hazards at the human end of the food chain . The use of antibiotics and hormones has helped cause basic changes in cattle and poultry feeding practices . // The practice of cramming immense populations of livestock into small areas is closely tied to the use of antibiotics in feed . Cattle are now confined by the thousands in feedlots where they must stand shank to shank in a mire of manure . Tens of thousands of chickens are raised under one roof in cages in which three or four birds are stuffed together in a 12 " by 18 " space . Veterinarians find that the incidence of respiratory diseases and other illnesses increases when animals are raised under such stressful conditions . Crowding also creates conditions favorable to the rapid- spread of disease . While this feeding system may increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contend with increased fears of disease and epidemics in his animals . He therefore feeds them a substantial diet of antibiotics , tranquilizers , and other prophylactic drugs to suppress disease and relieve stress . Corporate agriculture fears that its huge investments in feedlots and broiler houses would be threatened if discovery of unanticipated hazards to human health forced drastic restriction of the use of antibiotics and synthetic hormones . Their anxiety leads to tremendous pressures on the federal regulators and scientists who must evaluate the safety of agricultural chemicals . These pressures are doubly effective because the agencies which make the decision , FDA 's Bureau of Veterinary Medicine and USDA 's Consumer and Marketing Service , both have promoted the chemicalization of meat production . Questions about safety usually originate outside these agencies in the National Cancer Institute and other health agencies which have no direct voice in the decisions . For this reason , questions of safety in the use of animal drugs can not he left to the experts in the federal agencies and laboratories on the assumption that objective science will prevail . The search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dense as any in the Federal Trade Commission or the Interstate Commerce Commission . Politics , for example , influence the question of which chemical residues are to be looked for in meat . Dr. James Stewart , until recently chief of chemical residue sampling at USDA , concedes this is often a political question . Money is given to the Agricultural // Research Service in a lump sum and allocated accord-ing to whatever residue has caused the biggest stir in the media . When hormone pellets in chickens produced a scare in 1956-1957 , the number of animals checked for stilbestrol and other growth-stimulating chemicals greatly increased . In the mid-sixties , the possibility that drug-resistant bacteria might result from the use of antibiotics in feed caused alarms , and sampling for antibiotic residues became the vogue . In 1970 , since the mercury scare , USDA has initiated sampling for heavy metal residues , but planned to reduce monitoring of antibiotics and hormones , until dissuaded by public and Congressional criticism. ; ; In the past , the consumer has relied on scientists to provide answers to the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when weighed against the economic benefit of its use , is an acceptable risk ? But " acceptable risk " is ultimately a political judgment . Evaluation of balance of risks and benefits should be based on as complete and pertinent scientific data as pos-sible , but decisions about how much risk the public is willing to accept ? e.g. , weighing a potential cancer hazard against an increase in the price of beef ? must be made by society and its political leaders . The chem-ical industry and the producers and processors of meat know this and direct their paid advocates in the trade associations accordingly . The consumer must also be informed and represented if the hazards from meat 's hidden ingredients are to be kept to a minimum . It is only when the condition of full and timely disclosure of risks and benefits to the consumer is met that one can justifiably speak of the level of safety the con-sumer wants and is willing to pay for . Food Poisoning The federal meat and poultry acts create a false sense of security in the public mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers that the circular inspection mark with the word " Inspected for Wholesomeness " is the consumer 's " guarantee of safety . " The housewife who buys " USDA Inspected " meats may be forgiven , therefore , for believing she is buying a product free of disease-producing organisms . The USDA inspection sticker suggests that meat has gone through an inspection procedure which , with each successive step , leads to a safer product . In the case of bacteriological contamination ? the presence on meat of disease-producing germs ? the opposite may be the case . In Poland and Denmark , countries with outstanding meat standards , every object which comes into regular contact with meat during processing is routinely checked for the presence of salmonella , staphyloccocus , hepatitis , and other bacteria . Meat handlers and inspectors are tested to eliminate human carriers . In this country , no effort is made at any stage from slaughter to retail sale to monitor and control microbiological contaminants in fresh meat and poultry . In the absence of these controls , meat and poultry may become more contaminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of processing . An inspector at a poultry plant in the South gives a startling description of indifference to bacteriological hazards : During inspection , diseased and contaminated chicken parts drop into a belt which runs over a trough of water . Intestines , tumors , windpipes , fecal matter , and heads drop off into that trough . There are not enough spigots so employees wash their hands in the trough , then go back to handling chickens . I guess 40 ? 50% of " ready to cook " chicken goes out in a highly contaminated form.l Microbiological contamination most often occurs when the chicken 's abdomen is opened and its viscera removed . Once fecal material is deposited on the skin , it is difficult , if not impossible , to remove.2 After the bird has passed along the processing line , it goes into a " chiller , " a large tub of ice water . This is the last stage before the chicken is packed for market : Filthy feathers go directly into the chiller along with the bird . . . also fecal matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's the way it 's used . The bacteria count must be fantastic and the birds are absorbing 2 or 3 percent of that water.3 These conditions have been recognized by some sec-tors of the meat industry . The general manager of the Polo Food Products Company , which buys fresh poultry for its cooked products , reports that a continuing prob-lem with the fowl he buys is the presence of tramp metal such as staples and pieces of equipment , screws , nuts and bolts , and excessive feathers , hair , and improperly eviscerated birds . According to the manager " this hap-pens in many cases when a processor is trying to run a line too fast with not enough workers . " 4 These conditions are not typical of the industry as a whole , but indifference to contamination in clearly wide-spread . The General Accounting Office , in a Novem-ber , 1971 , report on sixty-five poultry plants accounting for one-fifth of the nation 's poultry output , found gross contamination in thirty-five plants . Ironically , the only person who checks bacteria counts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around once a year to sample tap water which goes into the chiller . Federally inspected poultry , there-fore , may he potent carriers of bacteria to the marketplace . The major causes of food poisoning are described in the chart below . The most common food-borne dis-ease is salmonellosis , described by the National Acad-emy of Sciences ? National Research Council as " one of the most important communicable disease problems in the United States today , " and " a potential threat " to every American.5 Fifteen hundred species of bacteria compose the genus Salmonella . The victim of the disease experiences abdominal pain , diarrhea , nausea , and vom-iting for from one to eight days . When the victim is very old or very young or debilitated by some other disease , it is frequently fatal . In the summer of 1970 , twenty-five residents of a Baltimore nursing home died within forty-eight hours from salmonella infection caused by an unidentified contaminated food . Salmonella is caused by an organism which abounds in nature , but is easily killed by normal cooking heat . // Consequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is recontaminated by remaining for several hours in warm temperatures , or touched by hands , cutting instruments , or cutting boards which have previously come into contact with uncooked fowl or meat . The National Communicable Disease Center estimates that 2 million Americans each year are afflicted with the disease at a probable cost of $300 million.6 Even this figure may underestimate the hazard . The Task Force on Research Planning in Environmental Health Science , in its 1970 report to the National Institutes of Health , warned that present reporting of food-borne diseases is inadequate . The data is provided voluntarily and is , therefore , dependent on the interest of state health departments . In recent years , three states or less have reported almost all the cases of salmonellosis in the United States , 7 indicating that most states fail to make comprehensive reports . Accurate data on the prev alence of this food-borne disease , therefore , are simply not available . Most cases are never recognized , let alone reported . Sudden cases of nausea , diarrhea , headache , and fever are passed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been caused by bacteria in un clean but appetizing food . The Task Force concludes : Although reports from the National Communicable Disease Center have been of value , the lack of adequate morbidity data is undoubtedly a major reason for the downgrading of the problem of food- and water-borne illness and for the lack of concern by decision-makers ( budget officials , health and welfare administrators , and political leaders ) in seeking corrective action.8* No one disputes that salmonellosis and other food-borne diseases are a serious problem , but there is con troversy over whether they are a regulatory problem . USDA has tried to take its inspectors and the meat // Causes of Food Poisoning Reported in 1970 Clostridium perfringens ?

Its publication Agricultural Marketing , speaking of salmonellosis , states : Hardly ever is the villain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the packing plant . Rather the leading suspect is someone outside the plant , such as the retailer , the caterer or housewife who fails to follow a few basic rules in caring for meat or poultry.l ? A study by the National Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta appears to support USDA . The study shows that , in a typical year of 124 outbreaks where the cause was known , only nine were caused by the food proces-sor . In ninety-seven cases , the fault rested with food service establishments such as restaurants , schools , and nursing homes . The consumer at home was at fault in sixteen cases . The Communicable Disease Center warns , however , that " it is difficult to draw definite conclusions about patterns of food-borne illnesses from these data . " It is far more complicated to trace microbiological con-tamination back to the processor than to the place where food is prepared . The point is that the risks of serious illness from mishandling meat , poultry , and eggs are greater if the food is contaminated when it leaves the food processor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry slaughtering plants , careless handling of pro-cessed food , and exposure of meat to filthy equipment in meat plants , increase the incidence of food-borne diseases . Domestic fowl probably constitute the largest single reservoir of salmonella bacteria , according to the National Academy of Sciences . The New England Journal of Medicine has reported that 50.8 percent of " U.S. Inspected " poultry in a ? sur-vey was contaminated with salmonella while only 48.7 percent of uninspected poultry was contaminated . This seems to indicate that some clean chickens become contaminated in the slaughterhouse . In eleven of thir-teen surveys of USDA inspected plants , public health doctors Arthur Wilder and Robert MacCready found high levels of salmonella present . They found that poultry products , both eggs and meat , are the com-modities most often incriminated in outbreaks of the disease.11 As much as 95 percent of the poultry from // one USDA plant was found to be contaminated . The study concluded that : It is obvious that the present federal inspection system for poultry can not insure a pathogenic-free product . The con-sumer expects that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every effort should be made to produce a pathogen-free product.12 Contamination of beef in meat plants also warrants concern . The National Academy of Sciences has stated that the number of individual animals carrying salmo-nella is usually relatively small , but slaughtering procedures provide very effective means of spreading contamination from infected to clean animals.13 Meat contaminants often originate in the slaughter operation from the soil and manure in cattle hides , spillage from the intestines , and the knives used to cut carcasses . Under presently approved USDA methods , carcasses being dressed on the kill floor are exposed to huge numbers of organisms . Scrupulous sanitation is especially vital when the processor is the one with control over cooking . Ready to eat meat products are usually processed at tempera-tures sufficient to destroy bacteria present in the con-taminated raw materials . Nonetheless , according to Dr. John Siliker of Siliker Laboratories : " The greatest potential danger lies in sliced sausage products , sliced bologna , luncheon meats , etc. , that are consumed with-out further cooking . In many cases these products are sliced and packaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in locations having air supplies in common with raw meat processing . " 14 Siliker urges con-stant bacteriological surveillance of the processing environment . In a one-week period in August , 1971 , Genoa salami produced by Armour and Hormel had to be recalled nationwide by USDA after twenty people became ill from staphylococcus bacteria found in the products . Dr. Gilbert Wise , a meat specialist for the Consumer and Marketing Service , warns that the public health danger from this source of contamination is increas-ing : " The food chain is getting longer . We 're introducing // new handling procedures , new processing procedures and every time the product is manipulated , there is another chance for contamination . Heat-and-serve convenience foods , which do not require thorough cooking prior to consumption , as well as mass production and distribution , rapid processing cycles and new packaging in containers , have added to the urgency of development of microbial standards . " 15 Federal efforts to establish microbiological standards have floundered . In 1968 , Rodney Leonard , then administrator of the Consumer and Marketing Service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department before they were implemented and action is still pending . In the absence of microbiological monitoring , USDA 's failure to enforce its present sanitation standards is an even more serious problem . The General Accounting Office , in its 1969 report on poultry inspection , presented a graphic example of this failure . On November 23 , 1962 , an inspector at a poultry plant which processed chickens to be used in meat pies reported the following violations : gravy used in the pies was often kept at temperatures up to 98 ? Fahrenheit for over five hours at a time , providing a perfect breeding ground for salmonella and other food poisoners ; baskets and racks were filthy and crusted with food from previous days . Sixteen memos from USDA to plant management warning of these violations were ignored . On December 3 , 1962 , USDA finally threatened to withdraw inspection services if the problems continued , but took no action . In another visit on February 13 , 1964 , USDA inspectors turned up eighteen violations , but no action followed . Two years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service warned the plant that its sanitation was a disgrace and gave it a deadline of December 3 , 1966 , to clean itself up . This deadline was then extended until March 17 , 1967 , although subsequent inspection showed that conditions remained about the same . The deadlines were again extended until finally , on November 3 , 1967 , the plant closed for relocation . This case and subsequent GAO reports showed that this five-year saga of noncompliance was not an isolated case.16 // For the present , the housewife remains her family 's last and perhaps only defense against these disease-carrying bacteria . The risks can and should be reduced through more rigorous inspection , the setting of maximum allowable microbiological levels , and the development of microbiological standards for use in processing plants , food service establishments , and other facilities where food is handled . To educate the consumer , the New Jersey Public Health Association has formally petitioned the Secretary of Agriculture to affix the following label to all raw meat and poultry : Caution : Improper handling and inadequate cooking of this product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspection , some disease-producing organisms may be present . Consult your local health department for information on the safe handling and preparation of this product . The Water Game Of the hidden ingredients added to meat products , excess water has the greatest potential for direct consumer fraud . The General Accounting office estimates that a 1 percent increase in the weight of poultry from added water may cost the consumer $32 million a year.17 Selling water as meat is obviously very profitable . And as a medium for bacteria and other contaminants , water threatens the consumer 's health as well as his pocketbook . Poultry absorbs moisture in two ways : when it is washed and chilled after evisceration , and by the/ deliberate addition of oil and water basting solutions by the processor . Some absorption of water in the production process is inevitable and desirable . The question is : how much ? The chilling stage , where the birds are rotated in large tubs of ice water , is critical . In order to prevent the incubation and rapid growth of bacteria , the body heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chilling is designed to lower the internal temperature of poultry to 40 ? or lower , a temperature which stops the growth of most foodpoisoning bacteria . // In the past , when chickens were chilled on ice , they did not absorb much water . But during the 1950s , equipment came into use which caused chickens to gain as much as 20 percent water by weight during processing . In 1960 , the Consumer and Marketing Service responded to this problem by moisture tolerances for the various classes of poultry processed at federally inspected plants . Chickens shipped in " ice pack " cartons , the most common method , were allowed to absorb 12 percent moisture during ' processing . The standards were developed in accord with what C &MS; felt was " good commercial practice " ( i.e. , the industry norm ) . In the 1960s , new developments in refrigeration made it possible to clean and chill birds adequately with considerably less water absorption , but the old C &MS; standards remain in effect . As a result the washing and chilling operation acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds as is legally possible . One processing plant employee frankly admitted that the controls on his plant 's chilling equipment were set to put as close to 12 percent moisture in the poultry as possible , despite the fact that the poultry could be adequately chilled and washed with 7 or 8 percent moisture absorption . " This extra 5% costs the consumer approximately $160 million a year .. Attempts by plant managements to keep the moisture absorption at the legal maximum means that small variations in plant operation frequently push the moisture absorption over the legal limit . ' USDA has been frequently criticized for failure to enforce its moisture regulations . The General Accounting Office has charged that large amounts of waterlogged poultry are being shipped to the consumer . In 1967 , for example , USDA allowed forty-four federal plants ? accounting for over 13 percent of all interstate poultry ? to stay in business despite exceeding moisture limits at least 20 percent of the time . ' " 0 The GAO concluded that the Department 's failure to act defrauded the consumer and encouraged managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the past the inspector in charge in a poultry plant took samples of slaughtered birds and reported the // plant when it was out of compliance on 20 percent or more of processing days . The inspector reported to a regional moisture controller who then visited the plant to check its chilling procedures . The in-plant inspector did not have authority to retain the watered poultry nor to adjust the chilling machinery . This led to excessive delay in correcting violations . In 1970 , two years after the GAO first presented its complaints to the Consumer and Marketing Service , USDA proposed a change in its regulations to allow the inspectors in the plants to retain waterlogged poultry and to allow the plants to adjust the chilling machinery under inspector supervision . Any poultry exceeding 13 percent moisture is retained by the inspector until drained . Any poultry between 12 and 13 percent is suspect and retained if it exceeds 12 percent on more than one test . The new regulations were proposed on March 20 , 1970 , but their implementation was delayed another eight months by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USDA poultry officials justified their foot-dragging by arguing that excess water is drained from the birds during shipment and handling and that , therefore , the consumer is protected . However , protests from the poultry processors over the new moisture limits clearly show that the new limits , by reducing the weight of birds at the plant and therefore the price supermarkets pay for them , can save the consumer money . Theodore Huisinga , Vice-President of the Willman Poultry Company in Minnesota , estimates that the new program will cost his plant between $30,000 and $40,000 a year . James Rooney of the Gopher Turke . Farm , also in Minnesota , warned that the new regulations would cost Minnesota turkey men $1 million to $2 million a year . " I The new regulations put additional pressure on the poultry inspector . Excess water in chicken is never discovered by the consumer . If the inspector does not control the poultry processor , he can water his birds with virtual impunity . Small changes in the water pressure or temperature of the chiller or even improper opening cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // New regulations providing for injections of water in meat of 2 to 10 percent and basting fluid in poultry up to 6 percent will put even greater burdens on the meat and poultry inspector . These regulations , advocated by the processors , went into effect in January , 1971 . Liquid injections are designed , according to the poultry industry , to inhibit dryness and make meat more tender and juicy . Unless carefully monitored , however , they can also bloat the meat or improve the meat 's color so that consumers will not be able to tell whether it is stale . The Federal Poultry Products Inspection Act and Federal Meat Inspection Act define an adulterated product as one having any substance " added or mixed or packed with the meat in order to increase its weight and size or reduce its quality or strength to make it seem of greater value than it is . " USDA claims that the liquid injections will serve a beneficial purpose and therefore are permitted under the law . Such meat must include a bold statement that declares the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each of its ingredients " stated in the order of predominance . " 22 Strict enforcement of these standards is necessary to protect the consumer from buying oil as well as water for the price of meat . USDA also permits the packers to sell added water at frankfurter prices . Under USDA regulations , the packers can add up to 10 percent water to cooked sausage products . As with chickens , the extra water is added during the chilling stage of processing . Using a generous rule of thumb , USDA assumes that typical meat contains four times as much water as protein . Therefore , if the average frankfurther has 11 percent protein , it will have 44 percent water . The packer can then add 10 percent more water , up to a level of 54 percent , before the frankfurter is considered adulterated . In practice , however , the water added to this hotdog is closer to 15 percent than to 10 percent . Laboratory analysts for Consumer Reports discovered recently that the typical meat used in frankfurters has a natural water-protein ratio of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an average 11 percent protein hotdog is therefore 39.6 percent , not 44 percent . When the packers , using USDA 's rule of thumb and 10 percent // dispensation , market a frankfurter with 54 percent water , the consumer ends up buying 36 percent more water than the natural meat contained . This invisible inflation of the food dollar costs consumers millions of dollars each year . Antibiotics and Microbial Pollution Antibiotics , the heralded miracle drugs developed during World War II , are now more frequently used by farmers than by doctors . There is increasing concern that this use of antibiotics may jeopardize their effectiveness in human medicine , yet feedlot operators , chicken growers , and other intensive livestock producers claim that their operations are inextricably hooked on these drugs . This apparent conflict creates a highly charged risk-benefit decision for federal regulators . Nearly 80 percent of the meat , milk , and eggs consumed in the United States comes from animals fed medicated feed during all or part of their lives.23 Antibiotics are fed to swine , chickens , and cattle from birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doses of antibiotics between 4.5 and 11 ppm ( parts per million ) are supposed to make the animals gain weight faster than they would if they ate their feed without drugs . Higher doses , up to 50 ppm in feed , are used prophylactically to keep disease from gaining a foothold in a herd of animals . Over half of the nation 's annual antibiotic production goes to livestock and poultry . Antibiotic feed additives make up a rapidly growing $100 million industry , involving sixty companies . Feedstufls , the leading weekly newspaper for agribusiness , has nearly as ma fy drug ads as the AMA Journal . There is a difference in style , however . Where the AMA Journal has a reclining bikinied beauty hawking Ampicillin , Feedstuffs has a healthy hog with the caption " Protect ' em , push ' em all the way to market with Pfizer 's Terramycin . " While the FDA must screen each antibiotic for safety and efficacy , farm use of these drugs is hardly controlled at all . A farmer can buy penicillin by the pound at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy one tablet for personal ( human ) use . Dr. William // B. Buck of the Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine told a 1967 National Academy of Sciences symposium : At present a farmer or any lay person can purchase many of these drugs in any quantity and without any restriction . Such persons can and do incorporate them into feed grain mixes for livestock at levels up to ten , perhaps twenty , times those recommended.2 Critics of the use of antibiotics in feed cite several potential health hazards : allergic and toxic effects of drug residues in drug sensitive persons ; the develop ment of hypersensitivity through frequent exposure to antibiotic residues ; and most important , the develop ment of drug resistant bacteria which may make some " miracle " drugs obsolete for human medicine . If antibiotic residues occur in food , highly allergic people may become seriously ill , particularly with peni cillin . Antibiotics may also upset the bacterial ecology of the stomach , intestines , and bowels and lead to diges tive disturbances . Finally , small prolonged doses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug resistance in man . Up to now , residues in meat appear insignificant , but those in eggs and milk have been high enough at times to cause allergic reactions . In 1969 , for example , USDA randomly sampled 3,523 of 135 mil-lion animals slaughtered and found antibiotic residues in less than 1 percent of them . However , when 470 animals were tested after the government had received word that excessive residues might be present now , 130 contained illegal residues of up to 40 units of penicillin per pound . FDA and USDA share responsibility for keeping anti biotics out of meat . FDA sets a safe level or tolerance for antibiotic residues in meat which USDA analysts then monitor . FDA is supposed to withhold approval of any antibiotic for which a practical method for detect ing its residues in meat is lacking . Unfortunately , because the agency , FDA , which approves the analytical method is different from the agency , USDA , which must use it , conflicts develop . FDA sometimes approves an antibiotic before USDA has had time to validate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as // coccidiostats in poultry ( coccidia are poultry parasites ) , were approved by FDA before a sensitive method of analysis was available to detect their residues.25 This failure has become more serious as FDA now suspects that some of the nitrofurans are carcinogenic.26 One reassuring factor , however , is that antibiotics are destroyed in the cooking of most food . Of far greater concern for public health is the threat that the use of antibiotics on farm animals will cause harmful bacteria to become drug resistant . Bacteriologists have long known that bacteria can quickly become resistant to an antibiotic and hand the mutant gene down to the next generation.27 Concern about this phenomenon increased in 1968 with a Japanese discovery that bacteria can " catch " resistance to antibiotics much as people " catch " germs . A harmless intestinal bacteria which becomes resistant to tetracyclines , for example , can transfer its resistance or R-factor to disease-causing bacteria that it bumps into . Moreover , certain bacteria , when exposed to one antibiotic , can develop and transfer resistance to other antibiotics with which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual becomes ill from one of these resistant bacteria populations . Doctors may discover too late that the antibiotic he customarily uses to treat the illness is no longer effective . Japanese doctors , during a 1968 epidemic of dysentery , found that the disease-carrying bacteria , shigellae , were resistant to not one but four different antibiotics . The health implications of drug-resistant bacteria are ominous . Dr. David H. Smith , an antibiotic expert at Harvard University , reports that in one year at Boston 's Children 's Hospital twenty-four of twenty-six deaths dote to bacterial disease were caused by drug-resistant bacteria . The London Times reported on April 4 , 1969 , that a total of thirty babies died of gastroenteritis over a three-month period in two hospitals in Manchester . A year earlier fifteen children died under similar circumstances in a hospital in Teeside . In both incidents , the deaths were caused by bacteria that failed to respond to antibiotics.28 There is no direct evidence connecting these cases of drug resistance with the use of antibiotics in feed . // It is important to note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as those used to treat human diseases , including streptomycin , penicillin , and tetracycline . Moreover , bacteria carried by animals often cause human illness , notably salmonella . A British study found humans and pigs to be harboring the same spectrum of drug-resistant salmonellae during a particularly lengthy outbreak of salmonella in England in 1969.29 It has also been demonstrated that farm workers who look after animals on antibiotic feed have more antibiotic resistant bacteria in their intestines than those who do not . " Laboratory tests have clearly established that it is theoretically possible for the drug resistance of animal bacteria to be transferred to human germs . Whether such transfers take place outside the laboratory remains a matter of controversy . Nevertheless , the Swann Report , an assessment of the risks and benefits of animal drugs by a British committee of distinguished scientists and health experts , relied heavily on a case where antibiotics used in calves produced a drug-resistant salmonella germ . The germ was transferred from calves to farm workers to dairy cattle , which passed it along in their milk . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on the Use of Antibiotics in Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine ) recommended sweeping restrictions on animal drugs to Parliament on November 20 , 1969 . The Report concluded that ( a ) an increase of bacteria showing transmittable antibiotic resistance has resulted from the use of antibiotics in farm livestock ; ( b ) some enteric animal bacteria ( e.g. salmonella typhimurium ) can cause disease in man and animals and that , therefore , development of resistance to antibiotics in these bacteria may endanger life . The report recommended that no antibiotic which has therapeutic value for man ? such as penicillin or the tetracyclines ? should be added to feed . Other antibiotics , such as nitrovin , virginiamycin , and zinc bacitracin , which are not used to treat human disease , can be substituted as growth promoters in feed . The Report also advised that other therapeutic antibiotics be sold only by prescription from a trained veterinarian . It // noted that farm workers who handle drug fed livestock are becoming resistant to antibiotics at a faster rate than the rest of the population . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the practice of giving antibiotics at subtherapeutic doses to simply relieve stress in animals . The Swann Report has been vigorously attacked by scientists associated with the chemical and drug industry in this country . Dr. Robert White-Stevens , now at Rutgers University but formerly with American Cyanamid , calls the report " a desperate attempt to turn the clock back . If the protein needs of man are to be met by the year 2,000 then such obsolete procedures will simply have to be abandoned and their adherents will be dragged kicking and screaming into the twentyfirst century . " 31 American drug companies have joined with the British pharmaceutical industry in trying to discredit the report in the United Kingdom . British scientists have complained about a propaganda campaign designed to frighten the consumer and small farmer with alarmist predictions about higher prices and costs . They also criticize " distinguished men in the feed antibiotic field from the U.S. " for giving out misleading and irrelevant data to support the anti-Swann cause.32 Nevertheless two successive British governments have upheld the Swann recommendations , and in 1970 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Use of Antibiotics to review the report . Compared to the British , FDA has been remarkably nonchalant in evaluating the potential hazards of animal drugs . In September , 1967 , Dr. C. D. Van Houweling , who is now Director of FDA 's Bureau o fe Veterinary Medicine , the nation 's chief regulator of animal drugs , warned that " FDA believes it is imprudent to persist in such a widespread application of antibiotics without attempting a systematic understanding of the consequences to the microbial environment of man and nature . " ; ; But while sales of animal antibiotics have increased well over 60 percent since this statement , FDA by December , 1971 , had still failed to complete its evaluation . // The FDA Task Force did state in its interim conclusions that " it is a logical conclusion that the use of antibiotics in food animals , which results in development of resistant organisms and an increased reservoir of some bacteria in animals which can be transferred to human beings , may give rise to a human health hazard . " 34 But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and other findings have delayed its final report . FDA Commissioner Charles Edwards has threatened to discharge the Task Force if it did not report by the end of 1971 . Three points of controversy on the task force are findings by some members ( 1 ) that the use of antibiotics as growth stimulants makes treatment of sick animals more difficult , ( 2 ) that feed antibiotics prolong the carrier state of salmonella organisms in the animal , ( 3 ) that bacteria have the ability to transfer to one another resistance to several antibiotics after being exposed to only one antibiotic.35 In carrying out FDA 's responsibilities , Dr. Van Houweling states : " the Bureau of Veterinary Medicine tries to strike a balance between safeguarding human health and meeting the needs of the livestock industry.36 Spokesmen for the livestock industry and drug companies warn that intensive livestock production would be very expensive if not impossible without drugs , but critics of antibiotics have evidence that the need for drugs has been exaggerated , and that the farmer is often pressured into buying drugs he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns . One of the three most prevalent poultry diseases , coccidiosis , shows increasing resistance to antibiotics . Dr. Whitehair and Dr. Pomeroy at a 1969 National Academy of Sciences symposium on animal feeds concluded , after a survey of animal infections , that even though the response to antibiotics is at times rather dramatic , " yet poultry diseases , enteric infections in pigs and calves , and mastitis in dairy cattle present a much greater problem today to both producers and public health officials than they did before the advent of antibiotics . " 37 British veterinarians too are finding that " multiple resistant strains are common and in recent times it // has become more difficult for veterinary surgeons to select a suitable drug for treating enteric bacterial dis ease of farm animals . " Second , drug companies use the same tactics as pesticide makers in making claims for the economic value of feed antibiotics to farmers . The latter give pesticides credit for increases in crop yield which fre quently are the result of fertilizers , new seed strains , and other farm technology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain and quality of livestock since the introduction of antibiotics , neglect to mention the contributions , in the same period , of better breeds , better housing , conveyor belt feeding , and improved diet to animal growth.3s Third , many scientists question the adequacy of the effectiveness of data supplied by the drug companies . Members of the federal antibiotics task force have noted that the data supporting the efficacy of antibiotics as a growth stimulant is often ten to fifteen years old and strongly recommend that the effectiveness of these drugs be reviewed " as promptly as possible . " 3 ' Dr. David Smith has observed that " early experiments on antibiotic-induced growth promotion were not adequately controlled and were carried out before modern breeding and sanitation procedures became a part of animal production . " 40 Antibiotics appear to be most effective as substitutes for sanitation when animals are crowded or improperly housed or nourished . ' Antibiotics may also cause harm to the animal by upsetting the normal microorganism balance in his intestine . Just as a pesticide can make a new pest out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial and pest insects , anti biotics in some cases release harmful bacteria from natural control by other microorganisms , thereby caus ing disease.42 On another level , farmers , like the typical consumer , have wasted millions of dollars buying combination anti biotics with bogus claims that they were doubly effec tive against disease . FDA has recently suspended the sale of over 1,000 antibiotic combinations because they were ineffective for their intended use . While the FDA 's experts may violently disagree in the overall assessment of antibiotic hazards , it does seem // clear that the use of human antibiotics , such as peni cillin and the tetracyclines as growth promoters and stress-relievers for livestock , poses an avoidable human hazard which the public should not tolerate , particularly when there are substitutes available which have no use in human medicine . The New England Journal of Medi cine , in an editorial on the phenomenon of resistant microbes , gives an apt warning : " Man has succeeded in polluting his environment with an astonishing variety of noxious agents . The development of an antibiotic resistant microbial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare . . . . " 43 // Pesticides and PCB 's The Department of Agriculture shares with the FDA responsibility for detecting residues of pesticides in the food supply . The residue surveillance program in the Consumer and Marketing Service collects tissue samples from beef animals and poultry before they reach the retail shelf , while FDA tests for residues in all foods after they are offered for sale.44 The chief virtues of the USDA program are that it tries to catch contaminated meat before it reaches the consumer and that it promises an intensive scrutiny of meat products alone . FDA 's market basket surveys of retail food , on the other hand , look at average pesticide intake from one 's total diet , not the amount of pesticide contamination in a particular food . According to Dr. Virgil Wodicka , Director of FDA 's Bureau of Food , Pesticides , and Product Safety , food is tested by making " composite samples of commodity groups . " One result is that high levels of pesticide in individual samples such as meat products " tend to be leveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analytical sample , so that the overall ( average ) . . . would not necessarily reflect the presence of extreme samples . " 45 Listed in the table below are results of sampling for pesticide residues in meat for the years 1967-1969 . These low levels of pesticide residues in meat are reassuring on the surface . Everyone appears to gain from these results : the consumer , worried about the long-term effect of pesticide residues on his health ; the // chemical companies fearing new restrictions on pesti cides ; the cattlemen and poultrymen who fear condem nation of their animals ; the budgeteers in the Executive Office and appropriations committees fearful of public pressure for expanded pesticide monitoring ; and the powerful marketing and commodity branches of USDA which do not want their promotional efforts for meat embarrassed by their colleagues in the pesticide regula tory branches . A closer look at these results , however , suggests strongly that they promise a good deal more than they deliver . USDA 's surveillance of pesticides in meat and poultry falls short in the following areas : ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small to give valid statistical estimates of the extent of contamination or to identify local pesticide hotspots . In 1969 , CMS 's eight regional laboratories tested only 3,000 poultry carcasses out of over 2 billion chickens and turkeys slaughtered . Sampling on this scale allows for spot-checks which at best might identify major national trends in pesticide residues . Excessive pesti150 SOWING THE WIND cide contamination of meat or poultry is often very localized , however , the result of negligence by farmers and processors in a single county or plant . Rodney Leonard , former Administrator of Consumer and Mar keting Service , states that " the sampling they do is n't intended to locate particular birds with pesticides in them . It 's more like sticking thermometers in rivers and lakes around the country and coming up with a national average water temperature . " 46 In October , 1969 , Campbell Soup 's packing plant at Worthington , Minnesota , discovered illegal amounts of heptachlor epoxide in turkeys stamped " inspected for wholesomeness by USDA . " A crash testing program con-ducted in strict secrecy was launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have to be banned on the eve of Thanksgiving . It turned out that only 350,000 turkeys were affected , and all of these came from growers under contract to Arkansas Valley Industries . The growers had spread heptachlor epoxide on their turkey ranges to hold down chiggers , despite label warnings that livestock should not be exposed to it. * Some of the birds contained as much as seventeen parts per million of heptachlor ( or thirty-four times the permissible level ) . If Campbell Soups had relied on USDA 's official assurance of " wholesomeness " without checking on its own , the contaminated turkeys would have been routinely sold for Thanksgiving dinner . ( 2 ) Some of the most dangerous pesticides are over-looked when USDA examines its meat samples . Many consumers have the mistaken impression that to look for one pesticide contaminant is to look for them all , but this is not the case . Until 1970 , USDA never looked for mercury . Sampling for lead , cadmium , and other heavy metals is just getting under way in response to recent alarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis oriented . They rarely take the initiative in looking for new contaminants in meat . The same can be said for the whole profession of chem ists . No American chemist thought to examine fish for mercury until a Norwegian exchange student at WestHidden // ern Ontario University in Canada showed them the way in 1970 . Another chemical contaminant overlooked by USDA until 1971 is the polychlorinated biphenyls , commonly called PCB's. ( 3 ) USDA permits the uses of some pesticides which may contaminate meat even though it lacks analytical technology to detect the chemicals in the food supply . USDA permits the use of the herbicide 2,4,5-T on pastures and rangeland where cattle graze . 2,4,5-T contains up to 1 ppm tetradioxin , a highly stable compound which causes birth defects in test animals and is highly poisonous to man ( see Chapter 7 ) . USDA 's pesticide monitors report , however , that they lack instruments sensitive enough to measure dioxin regularly in meat . ( 4 ) The secrecy with which USDA shrouds incidents of seizure gives the public a false sense of security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective chemical monitoring and controls . The PCB emergency in the summer of 1971 illustrates this point , as well as many other weaknesses of chemical surveillance , PCB 's ( for polychlorinated biphenyls ) are used in the form of a colorless , odorless liquid which is thicker and more syrupy than molasses and has the remarkable ability to withstand temperatures up to 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit . It is primarily used to conduct heat in transformers and other heat exchange equipment . PCB 's possess toxicological , chemical , and environmental properties strikingly similar to DDT . In fact , the compounds are so similar that some of the environmental damage attributed in the past to DDT is now thought to have been caused by PCB's.48 Monsanto is the sole domestic manufacturer of PCB 's ( under the name Aroclor ) . Like DDT and many other chlorinated hydrocarbons , PCB 's are extremely persistent , pervasive , and toxic substances . They degrade even more slowly than DDT , and are water insoluble and fat soluble . Thus , PCB 's accumulate and concentrate in bodily fat tissues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stability , PCB 's are found virtually everywhere in the ecosystem . One researcher reports that in arctic lakes " rarely if // ever visited by man , " all of the fish analyzed contained measurable amounts of PCB ; one lake trout had 12 ppm in its fat . Concentrations of up to 250 ppm have been found in human tissues . And random samples of milk from nursing mothers in California averaged over 2 ppm . The incomplete scientific evidence on PCB 's suggests that they constitute a significant human health hazard . Back in 1942 , all 100 men in continual work contact with PCB 's in , one plant contracted chloracne , a skin disease . In 1968 , cooking oil contaminated with PCB 's caused an outbreak of skin disease affecting over 300 people in Japan , including nine pregnant women . Some miscarried , two of their babies were stillborn , and all showed symptoms of chlorobiphenyl poisoning . According to the rough calculations of Dr. Robert Risebrough , a PCB expert at Berkeley , consumption of 45 pounds of fish and/or poultry contaminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ppm might produce the effects observed in Japan . There is evidence that the toxicity of PCB formulations may in fact be due to the presence of contaminants ( called dibensofurans ) similar to and only slightly less toxic than the dioxin contaminants of 2,4,5-T . Because PCB 's are primarily industrial chemicals , they have been exempt from the safety tests required of pesticides and food additives . FDA has never established a formal tolerance for PCB 's in food . But after several incidents of massive PCB contamination of the food supply , FDA finally set a temporary " action level " of 5 ppm in flesh and 0.5 ppm in eggs , below which PCB residues were deemed safe . According to Dr. Robert Risebrough , the 5 ppm figure " is just a number . I 'm sure FDA pulled it out of the air . " And recent events strongly suggest that FDA does not even enforce these levels with any seriousness . In 1971 , a PCB accident led to the most widespread accident of food contamination in regulatory history . PCB 's used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Carolina plant between April 30 and mid-July . The meal was sold to sixty-five companies in twelve states for use , among other things , as an ingreHidden // dient in feed for chickens , turkeys , hogs , and catfish . When Holly Farms , the nation 's largest producer of broiler chickens , discovered in June that flocks fed this feed showed mortality about seven times the normal rate , FDA ( responsible for inspection of shell eggs ) and USDA ( responsible for inspection of meat , poultry , and egg products ) were faced with a full-scale food crisis . In the ensuing weeks , these agencies condemned many tons of fish meal , over 165,000 broilers , 250,000 pounds of turkeys , hundreds of thousands of eggs , several hundred thousand pounds of egg products , over 1,000 tons of catfish feed , and other assorted foodstuffs . The PCB incident has several lessons . First , the peculiar division of inspection responsibilities between USDA and FDA can lead to a striking lack of coordination . For example , FDA never furnished USDA with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contaminated meal ; thus USDA could not ensure that all possible sources of contamination of meat and poultry were closed off . Second , many of these failures are chronic and derive , to a great extent , from the agencies ' lack of adequate resources to deal simultaneously with more than one food emergency ( a fact acknowledged privately but almost never publicly by many food inspection officials ) . Indeed , it is precisely because these agencies are so vulnerable to crisis and need more support and resources that their passion for secrecy and public complacency is so irresponsible . Throughout the PCB affair , the agencies never wavered from their Panglossian public information posture . An egregious case in point occurred in August when FDA took samples from a suspect shipment of 60,000 eggs in North Carolina , releasing the shipment for trucking to a Washington , D.C. distributor . Five days later , when FDA completed its analysis of the sample , it found PCB levels in the sample four to five times the permissible concentration . FDA went to the distributor 's warehouse , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area restaurants several days earlier . At this point , FDA threw up its hands and went on to other things . It made no effort to alert consumers to the danger // so that they could destroy those contaminated eggs not yet consumed . The matter only became public when , over a week later , an outside investigator leaked it to the press . FDA , asked by the press to explain its performance , proceeded to systematically undermine the integrity of its own " action level , " established in light of the chronic toxicity of PCB 's , their concentration in human tissues , and their ubiquity in the ecosystem . One FDA spokesman told the press , " that much PCB is like a drop in a tank car . " Another insisted that there was no real health problem due to the short-term exposure . " I 'd hate everybody to start worrying about the eggs they eat . " It is precisely such perfunctory , complacent public assurances in the face of scientific uncertainty concerning PCB 's that is bound to increase the alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear the risks of uncertainty . These incidents of nondisclosure to the public are all too common . Not only do they ? when they are ultimately brought to light ? erode public confidence in food inspection agencies , but by inhibiting the public and Congress from learning of the magnitude of the threat of chemical contaminatioh of the environment , these agencies dissuade the public from pressing for changes in public policy concerning food inspection and toxic substances . Finally , effective regulation requires detailed information about the characteristics and location of chemical contamination of the food supply . This information is at present not available to the food agencies or even to Congress . For example , Monsanto , the sole manufacturer of PCB 's , has continually and steadfastly refused to furnish Congressman Ryan with its production and sales data concerning PCB 's . It regards such data as " extremely confidential " even though it has no competitors for this product . Monsanto states that it is willing to furnish the information to " responsible government agencies " but reserves the right to determine which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compel the disclosure to government agencies of all information for the protection of the public should be enacted . // Carcinogens in Meat : Who Gets the Benefit of the Doubt ? Almost 200 years ago , Sir Percival Potts , an English physician , discovered the relationship between exposure to soot and a high rate of scrotal cancer in chimney sweeps . This discovery marked the beginning of studies of the environmental causes of cancer . In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries the studies began to focus on man-made chemicals as causes of cancer . A leading cancer specialist , Dr. E. Boyland , now estimates that " not more than 5 percent of human cancer is due to viruses and less than 5 percent to radiation . Some 90 percent of cancer in man is therefore due to chemicals , but we do not know how much is due to endogenous carcinogens and how much to environmental factors . " 49 An expert committee of the World Health Organization concluded in 1965 that at least half of all cancer in man is due to environmental factors . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prevented by finding and removing chemical carcinogens from food , water , and other environmental sources.50 During the 1950s , when the breakthroughs in chemical technology achieved in World War II began to be applied to agriculture and food processing , concern mounted about the potential hazards for man and the environment of the chemical industry 's rapidly proliferating products.51 This concern led to a series of amendments to the Food , Drug , and Cosmetics Act of 1938 ? the Pesticides Amendment in 1954 , the Food Additives Amendment in 1958 , and the Color Additives Amendment in 1960 ? which aimed to place the burden of establishing safety of these chemicals on the chemical industry . These laws make the government 's safety decisions appear very straightforward . When judging food chemicals , FDA is to consider only whether the chemical is effective ? i.e. whether it serves its intended purpose ? and whether it is safe when used as directed.52 The economic impact of the chemical on the food industry was ruled out , as are any benefits it may have . // In practice , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaney Amendment , one of the 1958 amendments , states categorically that it is unsafe for a chemical that causes cancer to be added intentionally to food . But , as we shall see , exceptions to this rule permit some carcinogenic chemicals to appear in meat indirectly . Second , safety is a very relative concept , especially when one is trying to extrapolate hazards for man from reactions of test animals . The latitude for human judgment in estimating risk is very , very wide . Third , when hazards turn up , as they often do , after a chemical has become entrenched in the marketplace , the definition of safety often takes on political implications as the food lobbies maneuver to protect their investment . The regulators , in defining safety , often use code words such as " toxicological insignificance " and " no-effect levels " and " limits of analytical sensitivity " to mask the fact that benefits and industry reaction are being weighed unofficially against risks . As a result , regulators are constantly making decisions which have the effect of determining whether small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals ) should be tolerated in food . These decisions are as politically hazardous for the regulator as they are potentially perilous for the public . To the sausage maker and the cattleman who uses the chemicals to make his hotdogs red and his steers grow faster , the risks may seem very remote and the benefits very palpable . To cancer specialists , however , the economic benefits may seem trivial and the risks ? a possible increase in the incidence of cancer a decade or more after human exposure ? often catastrophic . The consumer , if he knows about the carcinogenic residues at all ? and often he does n't ? is simply confused and often a little frightened . No one wants to increase the risks of cancer , but does it really make sense to increase the price of beef or turn hotdogs gray because a chemical caused cancer in a mouse or a hamster ? These questions are made more complex because the consequences of a given decision are shrouded in mystery . One often does not know how much of the carcinogen is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or how many people might ultimately be // affected by it.53 Unlike botulism where an inspection failure leads rapidly to a readily diagnosed lethal disease , a carcinogen may wait years to strike and then leave no clue to its identity when it does . In other words , the regulator 's decision usually has little or no feedback to tell him whether he has done the right thing . In the absence of confirming scientific data , politics often moves in . No responsible critic expects the agencies to guarantee absolute safety . But many of the questions about the relative risks and benefits of food chemicals could he answered with more research and sharper residue detection methods . Unfortunately the agencies , influenced by consumer apathy ( now diminishing ) , internal organizational conflicts , and pressures from the food and chemical industries and the budget cutters in the Office of Management and Budget , have often been slow to make this investment or require industry to make it . For example , Congress appropriated over $6 million more for meat and poultry inspection for fiscal 1972 than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleading poverty , were planning to cut back on chemical surveillance of meat . It is up to Congress , not the food bureaucracy , to decide how much the public is willing to pay for safer food . If Congress is to set priorities responsibly , the public must be informed about the risks , costs , and benefits of food safety decisions . The next two sections provide an inside look at two of the most significant food safety issues facing FDA and USDA . DES : Balancing the Risks of Hormones in Meat Nearly three-fourths of the 40 million cattle slaughtered annually in the United States have been fattened with an artificial hormone banned as a threat to public health in Sweden , France , Australia , Argentina , and seventeen other nations . In addition , Sweden and Italy have banned the importation of cattle from the United States which have been fed this hormone . Known as DES , or diethylstilbestrol , it is mixed with feed to increase the efficiency with which cattle convert feed into pounds of beef . It is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is strong evidence that it causes cancer in both test animals and man. * According to the Elanco Products Division of Eli Lilly , the chief producer of DES , cattle fed this hor mone gain 10 to 13 percent more weight on 10 percent less feed than cattle without stilbestrol . It adds $90 million annually to the profits of cattle growers . The National Cattlemen 's Association estimates that beef prices would increase up to 10 percent if DES were not used . ( Some meatpackers and veterinarians claim that DES also makes beef watery and of lower qual ity , but experiments to date fail to support this charge . ) Since it was first approved for use in poultry in 1947 , DES has caused concern because it causes cancer in several species of test animals , including cancer of the breast in mice , rats , and dogs , cancer of the testicles in mice , and cancer of the kidneys in hamsters.54 Like many other known carcinogens , DES induces cancer only after a long latency period . Malignant tumors appear only after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lifetime . Until very recently , cattlemen took comfort in the fact that DES had not been shown to cause cancer in human beings . But in April , 1971 , researchers at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston made a star tling discovery which puts the risks of DES in a new light . In seven young women , they diagnosed adenocar -- cinoma of the vagina , an extremely rare cancer which heretofore had been virtually unknown in premenopau sal women . Medical detectives , compiling exhaustive case histories on the girls , found one common factor in their backgrounds which seemed to explain this aston ishing cluster of cases : between fifteen and twenty years ago , the mothers of each of the girls had been treated with stilbestrol during pregnancy to prevent miscar riage. ** The victims had received DES in utero , as fe tuses . The New England Journal of Medicinein an // alarmed editorial , called this discovery " highly signifi cant , of great scientific importance and serious social implications .

In addition to the cancer risk , there is also the possi bility that synthetic female hormones , such as DES , may upset the hormonal balance and induce sterility or fem inine characteristics in men . Stockholm University 's Dr. Allan Bane , a veterinary specialist with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization which has called for a worldwide ban on DES , cites cases in the United States where farmers who inhaled DES dust while mixing it with feed , developed female-like breasts and symptoms of sterility . There is also the famous case of the New York restaurant employee whose fondness for chicken necks led to startling changes in his anat omy . After the restaurant 's patrons were served the wings , legs , and breasts , the man was given the leftover chicken necks for his supper in the kitchen . At that time , DES pellets were routinely implanted in the necks of chickens to speed growth . The man ate a multitude of necks and developed pronounced female characteristics . ( DES implants in chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , requires DES far in excess of amounts the average citizen would be ex-posed to . It is the cancer hazard primarily which leads USDA to condemn all meat in which any residues of DES are detected. * Nevertheless citizens continue to be exposed . While the amount of DES getting into meat is the most urgent question and will he discussed at length , there is also the problem of the fate of the hormone after it is excreted ' from the animals in the feedlot . While little definitive information is known about DES after it
