For such a contentious subject , TIME 'S special report on socialism ( March 13 ) drew a remarkably calm and reasoned set of responses from our readers , as reflected in the excerpts printed in this week 's Letters column . In contrast , the cover story on the serene Cheryl Tiegs ( March 6 ) brought a surge of emotion-charged letters-555 at last count . Most of our critics were angry and articulate women who found the story sexist . Predictably , the most enthusiastic supporters were males who felt that the cover was , as one put it , " a breath of fresh air . " <P> Week after week TIME 'S readers write , continuing a dialogue with our writers and editors that the magazine has always encouraged . In 1977 , 58,518 readers sent in letters , just a bagful less than 1976 's election-year record of 59,071 . <P> Among our heaviest mail producers was the coverage of the widely acclaimed television series Roots , based on Alex Haley 's bestselling book . Americans became fascinated with finding their own roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of articles on the clash between gay liberationists and Anita Bryant produced 997 letters ; most of the correspondents were angry at Bryant . As it happened , the subject that drew the most comment was not a story at all . When TIME 'S new graphic design appeared in August , most of the 1,900 comments were sharply negative . But within a month the furor had died down , and readers were writing in to say that they were warming to the changed format as to a new friend . <P> Every day , four or five bulging mailbags arrive on the 23rd floor of the Time-Life Building in Rockefeller Center . The letters are immediately pored over by Letters Chief Maria Luisa Cisneros and her staff . The most newsworthy are sent to Reporter-Researcher Nancy Chase , who picks those that will be published . A digest of the week 's letters is also distributed to TIME 'S editors and news bureaus . All letters are acknowledged , and those that question the tone , emphasis or factual content of a story are answered by Cisneros , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondents . More and more , Cisneros and her co-workers are finding that the letters are thoughtful , and require thoughtful replies . Says Cisneros : " Our writers are much more serious now . They really mean business . " All of which pleases the writers and editors of TIME , who pay close attention to the comments of their best critics .
