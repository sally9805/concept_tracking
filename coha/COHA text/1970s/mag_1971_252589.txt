About 300 million people in the world have highly visible deformities , which cause emotional problems not just for the victims but for the society around them . Primitive cultures often " solve " the problem by putting the cripples to death . Civilized cultures , it now appears , might do the same if they dared . <P> In a three year study of attitudes toward the maimed , two German psychologists , Gerd Jansen and Otto Esser , questioned 1,600 adults and 1,000 school-age children . To avoid hypocrisy , they even checked some of their cases with lie detectors . <P> Many of their subjects spoke sympathetically of the handicapped , but they often reacted to the sight of deformity with involuntary revulsion : breaking into a sweat or feeling faint chills . Few of them wanted to be friends with a deformed person , much less to marry or adopt one . Most ( 63% ) thought the victims should be kept out of sight in institutions . Although nobody said openly that the handicapped deserve to die , a number spoke guardedly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably would rather be dead . " <P> Other findings : <P> The younger the children being tested , the more pronounced their aversion to the handicapped . " Rejection is the spontaneous reaction , " says Esser . " As children grow into society 's system of norms , they also grow into pity . " - Children dislike slightly handicapped youngsters more than gravely handicapped ones . Esser 's explanation is that healthy children at first think of a child with a minor defect as an equal , but then are disappointed and angered when they find he can not keep up . By contrast , a child on crutches or in a wheelchair is so " different " that the healthy child feels no sense of identification . ? Ignorance is a major obstacle to social contact with the handicapped . Ninety percent of those interviewed said they did not know how to approach such a person : Would it hurt him to shake hands ? they wondered . Did he want help , and if so , what kind ? <P> A physically normal person 's aversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being struck by a similar fate . As Jansen and Esser see it , the burden-perhaps an impossibly heavy one-is on the victim himself , to let others know how he would like to be treated and to shift attention away from his damaged body and toward the self inside .
