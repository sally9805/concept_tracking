txt Governor Carey yesterday ended his support of Mario M. Cuomo for Mayor and gave his " full and enthusiastic endorsement " to Representative Edward I. Koch , who defeated Mr. Cuomo in the Democratic primary . Mr. Carey , who had promoted Mr. Cuomo 's candidacy and who had promised to back him through the general election even if he ran only on the Liberal line , signaled his decision to reporters yesterday morning in Austin , Tex . But it was not until he had returned to New York last night and spoken with Mr. Cuomo by phone that his office issued a statement withdrawing the commitment to Mr. Cuomo . Reached at home last night , Mr. Cuomo praised the Governor and called him a friend who " did everything a friend who also happens to be a Governor could do . " Despite the lobs of his major supporter , Mr. Cuomo said he would remain in the race on the Liberal line and was " actively pursuing " the mayoralty . Mr. Koch issued a statement , which said , " I welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every New Yorker . " Governor Says Goal Achieved In his statement last night and in his brief remarks to reporters yesterday in Texas , Mr. Carey explained that his major goal in getting involved in the mayoral election was to provide new leadership for the city . The Governor was known to feel that Mayor Beame and Bella S. Abzug , who were ? among those ruled out of contention in the initial primary voting of Sept. 8 , could not run the city . Further , he said , having accomplished his goal , he had to devote his time to running the state and not to New York 's mayoral election . What he did not say was that he will be a candidate for reelection in his own right next year and could not ask potential backers for more money in a losing cause for Mr. Cuomo . Among the issues facing the state that he said demanded his attention was the need for legislation to enable New York City to sell notes this year , a need underlined by a letter to him from Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last week . Need for Legislation Cited Mr. Carey indicated that he would call a special session of the Legislature if the legislators did not take up the matter on their own when they reconvene next month . Mr. Proxmire , speaking for the Banking Committee , which oversees the Federal Government 's loans to New York City , said that he wanted the city to get back into the commercial investment market // this year . The investment community , however , wants safeguards written into a loan agreement , and the city 's bond counsel has said that such safeguards would require legislative approval . " We have legislation that 's required in Albany for a city note offering , " Mr. Carey said in a conversation at the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library at the University of Texas before delivering a speech . " If it requires legislation , " he said , " as I believe it does , those are the things we have to concentrate on . That has to be my preoccupation , not politics . I ca n't spend all mytime in meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to something that 's behind us now , that is , the runoff and the primary . " Cuomo ' Not Surprised ' Mr. Cuomo last night said that in his phone conversation with Mr. Carey the Governor had not specifically told him - what he was going to do , although it was clear that some change in his position was imminent . " He said he thought he had better get back to the business of running the state , " Mr. Cuomo said . " I 'm not surprised by what he did . I understand the Governor 's position . He 's Governor , and he 's head of the Democratic Party . " I do n't feel betrayed . It would be very difficult for me to feel betrayed by this Governor . He has been a friend to me . I have no complaints . He has been a very good Governor , and I hope he wins again . I could have made it very easy by winning the primary , but I did n't . " Mr. Carey , in his statement last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , James Vlasto , called Mr. Koch " a man of proven ability and deep commitment to progressive government . " him " Based on my long association with i as a colleague , I know that he possesses outstanding qualities of leadershi7 , " the statement said . The decision by Mr. Carey to drop Mr. Cuomo ended a dilemma that had plagued him since Sept. 19 , when his hand-picked candidate lost the primary runoff : whether to be a loyal Democrat and support Mr. Koch or be a loyal friend and support Mr. Cuomo . There were increasing indications in recent days that the decision had so occupied the Governor that he was neglecting the duties of his office . Mr. Carey had tried to get Mr. Cuomo to end the problem by withdrawing from the race or , failing that , by being an inactive candidate , but Mr. Cuomo refused . Officials of the Liberal Party could not be reached immediately last night . They were expected to be angry about the Cuomo decision since , at Mr. Carey 's urging , they had dropped plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican candidate for Mayor . Now they are left with Mr. Cuomo , who said last night that he was in the race to stay unless " my money dries up and everybody leaves me and Matilda his wife ) over a pot of coffee ? which I do n't expect to happen . " " The game is lost only when we stop trying , " Mr. Cuomo insisted . But with six week until the Nov. 8 election , it was clear that a Cuomo victory would be ranked among the political upsets of the century .
