For more than two decades American investment in the Far East has benefited from a strong U.S. military presence . Confident that their invested dollars were reasonably secure , American corporations have poured in excess of $1 billion since 1964 into new electronic , car assembly and other manufacturing and distributing facilities all along the Pacific rim of Asia . The outlay contributed to rapid economic growth rates-more than 10% in South Korea , Taiwan and the Philippines in 1973-and also to soaring overseas profits for both the multinational companies that pumped in the money and the banks that financed them . Now , in the wake of the Indochina debacle and the uncertainty surrounding U.S. foreign policy elsewhere in Asia , businessmen are starting what President Dorman Commons of the San Francisco-based Natomas Co. , an oil firm active in Asia , calls " a major reassessment of the role of U.S. investment in the Pacific . " <P> Privately , several American corporate and banking executives admit that a number of capital outlays in Asia are being quietly deferred ; others are being " downgraded " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them more carefully . As a result of the reappraisal and the worldwide recession , total U.S. investment in Asia is expected to slow down . The country that will be affected most is Thailand , where Communist-backed insurgents have already become more aggressive . Some investors there are also dismayed by the Thai government 's insistence on reducing the American military presence in order to appease Communist neighbors , a situation aggravated by last week 's events off the coast of Cambodia . <P> In Thailand , American companies have more than $120 million invested , largely in rubber tires , textiles and electronics . Preparing to journey for a firsthand look at the Asian situation , National Semiconductor Corp . President Charles Sporck last week termed his company 's Thai assembly plant " a source of concern . " He added that despite Thai government assurances that the plant is secure , " to tell you the honest truth , I 'm not so sure . " In the first quarter of 1975 , applications to invest in Thailand from U.S. and other firms fell more than 50% below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker in Bangkok : " People are becoming reluctant to invest more because of the situations in Cambodia and Saigon , and they rather like to wait and see . " <P> What they have seen thus far can hardly be reassuring . Although the Thai economy remains strong , stepped-up guerrilla attacks have forced a shutdown of operations by three U.S.-Thai mining companies , an Italian construction concern and an American oil firm . Last week a group of bankers in New York to discuss a new Thai oil-drilling venture had their meeting interrupted by the news that U.S. Air Force planes had sunk Cambodian ships . They adjourned to await further news .
