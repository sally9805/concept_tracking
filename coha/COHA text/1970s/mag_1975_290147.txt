Leave it to the New York City Ballet to come up with something novel in the way of dance spectaculars : instant festivals of new works inspired by the music of a single composer . In one heady , hectic week of June 1972 , the company presented 21 original ballets , all shaped by Igor Stravinsky compositions . Last week , to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Maurice Ravel 's birth , City Ballet offered a unique " Homage " to that composer , with the first of three programs that will provide New York City audiences with 16 brand-new pieces of choreography ( plus one untarnished oldie , La Valse ) . <P> No other company in the world would even dare this kind of paroxysm of creativity . The main reason , of course , is that no other dance troupe has resident choreographers with the inventiveness of George Balanchine or the fluency of Jerome Robbins , who will be responsible for 13 of the Homage productions . If audience reaction at a celebrity-laden gala preview can be trusted , the Homage to Ravel could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have as lasting an aesthetic impact as the Stravinsky festival is another matter . That orgy of new dance is an evergreen memory to many balletomanes , and ten of the works created for it are still in the company 's repertory . <P> Dreamy Look . Judging by the first program , the Ravel Homage may be a mixed blessing . The opening ballet was Balanchine 's Sonatine , set to a Ravel piano piece of 1906 . It is the sort of evanescent pas de deux that Mr. B. has created countless times in the past . As performed by Violette Verdy and Jean-Pierre Bonnefous , it has the dreamy , offhand look of an advanced studio exercise-lovely to look at but nothing substantial to remember . <P> Reviewing any work by Jerome Robbins these days is something of a risk . He fusses and tinkers with his choreography so much that two performances of a work are seldom the same . Robbins might want to make changes in the first and third sections of Concerto in G ; the movements for soloists and the corps are marred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and curse . It is to be hoped that he will leave untouched Concerto 's second section , an extended adagio pas de deux for Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins that ranks with Robbins ' loveliest creations . The best of his pas de deux have a sense of intertwined intimacy . They constitute a kind of visual poetry in suggesting , through gesture and motion , the moods and mystery of the relation between man and woman . This achingly tender dance duet is greatly enhanced by the supple , lyric grace of Farrell , who has returned to the company after five years in exile , as it were , with Maurice Bjart 's Ballet of the 20th Century . There is a mature queenliness now in the style of this quintessential Balanchine ballerina , and she has never danced better .
