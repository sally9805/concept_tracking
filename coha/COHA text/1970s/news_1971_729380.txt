txt All kinds of thoughts went thru my mind when I first found out we had been invited to visit Red China . It was the last day of the table tennis tournament in Tokyo and we all were shocked by the invitation . I really did n't know anything about China except the little I had read in history books , and , of course , the propaganda you hear . At first I thought the trip would be a great opportunity , but when I started thinking it over , I began wondering what their purpose was in asking us . Then , other thoughts  --  maybe the people would n't like us or maybe we would n't get back . But I had to make a decision that same day and decided to go . I felt the Chinese All Sports Federation would take good care of us . All but two of us went . One man had to pick up his mother in Seoul , Korea , and a girl had scheduled a vacation with a friend in Hawaii .

I was rather surprised , tho , that there was no real briefing by the State Department .

We flew from Tokyo to Hong Kong and from there went by train to the border . I became more and more nervous during the two hour train ride , and I think the others felt the same way . One man played cards ; I looked out the window . The woman across the aisle kept fumbling with her camera . She was so nervous she could n't get it back in the case . That was the same woman who later broke out in a rash which a Chinese doctor told her resulted from a nervous condition . He gave her a shot of Vitamin B.12 .

I remembered the shriveled old woman on the platform as we got off . She had a basket of candy and gum and she kept trying to sell us trinkets . We talked to each other while we were in the station . Once I went outside to look at the river that separated us from China . After an hour and a half , it was time to go . I had lost some of the nervousness while sitting in the station , but the minute I walked out that door I felt it building up again . We went down a little sidewalk toward the bridge that crossed the river . It was a big bridge with a metal top and a wood floor . There was barbed wire along the sides and there were guards standing every few feet . When I saw the guards , it reinforced the fears I 'd had . We walked across the bridge two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rifle stepped out . I think my heart stopped . But he simply collected our passports . I did n't see mine again until I came back across the border a week later . At the other end of the bridge , Mr. Fong from the All Sports Federation was waiting for us . He was very friendly and , thru an interpreter , welcomed us . There were other people there , too , and they all seemed very nice . Get on Canton Train They took us to a rest station right away , a place with davenports and chairs . We drank tea while they checked our baggage three customs . But they did n't really check it  --  a Chinese woman later told us proudly that we had passed customs without our bags being opened . I was pretty tense when we went into the rest station and saw Mao 's picture on the red books and quotations everywhere . We asked whether we could take the books and they said , " Oh , yes , of course . " I found one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After an hour they served us lunch  --  eight or 10 courses .

I wanted to eat , the , because I did n't want to offend our hosts . Since they served the food to us , we had some of everything . There were no knives or forks  --  only chopsticks . I 'd never used them be- fore . The Chinese people laughed with us as they showed us how to use the chopsticks . I got pretty good at it , except I never did get so I could cut meat . After lunch , we got on a train for Canton . It was a regular passenger train , but it was old and had kind of a dirty appearance on the inside .

The Chinese all wore the typical uniforms , either gray or blue pants and jackets with stand up collars . Some had on white shirts or blouses . Wear Red Buttons The men and women looked very much alike except that the women had longer hair , cut as tho someone had put a bowl over their heads . Everyone wore the red buttons with a g ' d picture of Mao . On the way to Canton , we went past green fields with hills in the background . Men in coolie hats , the kind you see in history books , were working in the fields with handmade hoes . There was n't any farm machinery of the kind seen in the United States .
