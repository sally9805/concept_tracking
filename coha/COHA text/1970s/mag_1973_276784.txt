" It 's hard to believe that a man of your intelligence could have been involved in so much complicated complicity and knew nothing about it . " <P> - Senator Herman E. Talmadge <P> " What a liar . " <P> - Senator Daniel K. Inouye , muttering to himself but picked up by a live microphone . <P> However injudicious , those conclusions reflected the frustrations of the Senate Watergate committee as the seven Senators grappled futilely with the superbly prepared , unyielding testimony of a long-awaited witness : John D. Ehrlichman , President Nixon 's former domestic affairs adviser . Bobbing and weaving with both body and word , the confident and combative Ehrlichman admitted to not a single impropriety , regretted nothing , professed to have had an amazing unawareness as the scandal gradually engulfed the White House . Through four days of surprisingly ill-focused questioning , the loquacious aide insisted upon a similar uncomprehending innocence on the part of his boss , Richard Nixon . <P> If the Senators learned little that was new about how the wiretapping and burglary of the Democratic national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken in order to conceal all evidence pointing toward Nixon 's associates , they learned more than they seemed to want to about Ehrlichman 's personal and political ethics . <P> This amoral view from just outside the Oval Office embraced burglary as legal in safeguarding national security even when not specifically authorized by the President , job overtures to a judge handling a politically charged trial as proper , snooping and tailing to determine the sexual and drinking habits of candidates as legitimate practices in political campaigns . Stealing psychiatric records , recording phone calls from friends seeking advice , arranging for a former Cabinet officer to avoid confronting a grand jury-all were unobjectionable to Ehrlichman . <P> In his chilling concept , it does not matter that there is both a law and an ethic to protect every man 's conversations with his psychiatrist . Nor does it matter whether such information serves any legitimate purpose ; Ehrlichman expressed doubts about psychiatry . If Government wants it , there ought to be a way to get it . After all , insurance adjusters , any private detective , seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a doctor . Why not the White House ? <P> Easily the most defiant and least contrite of all the Watergate witnesses thus far , Ehrlichman 's mastery of the situation was impressive , his debating skill sharp , his language fascinating , his face an all-too-expressive reflection of his inner disdain and contempt for his questioners . When the nomination of the hapless L. Patrick Gray as FBI director was doomed , Ehrlichman did not urge its withdrawal , but suggested coldly : " We ought to let him hang there . Let him twist slowly , slowly in the wind . "
