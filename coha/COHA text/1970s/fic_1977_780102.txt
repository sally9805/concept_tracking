 | Although the Israeli understood his captor perfectly , he did n't respond . " Stand up ! " The guard gripped his kurbash , a leaden whip made from the coarse hairs of a bull 's tail . " My pleasure , " Dov said , struggling to his feet , refusing to let the pain rippling through him register on his face . Several of his ribs were cracked and the open wounds on the backs of his legs , inflicted by palm frond lashings , festered with infection . Haltingly Dov followed the guard through the dimly lit underground corridor , past two narrow passages lined with the fourteen al-Aadem , death row cells ; then past the damp muabed section , containing those serving life sentences ; until they reached an iron gate . The guard fitted a single key into the lock . The bolt clattered and the metal squeaked loudly as he pushed the gate open . Farther on , the corridor walls changed from gray to white . As they mounted a flight of concrete stairs the temperature rose . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of perspiration glistened on his brow . In the center of the room stood a high straw stool supported by wooden legs . Opposite it was a desk , uncluttered , with an upholstered chair . The plaster walls were bare ; the lone window closed ; the blades of the fan overhead , still . The guard motioned to the stool with the butt of his kurbash . Dov moved toward it and sat . His legs dangled ; neither they nor his back had any support . Outside the sun beat down on the desert . The sweat began to trickle from Dov 's body , dampening his brown prison shirt . According to a thermometer by the door the room temperature stood at 102 degrees . Moments later Suleiman Sarraj entered carrying a copper tray loaded with iced drinks . He set it on the edge of the desk , removed a tan folder from the top drawer , and  | sat down . The guard stationed himself against the wall at the prisoner 's back . " How are you , Dov ? " Sarraj asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just fine . I 'm in a beautiful suite on one of the lower levels . It 's got everything  --  a blanket , a gallon can , room service , meals delivered directly to my door . You ought to stop by sometime . " " Oh Dov , " Sarraj said , shaking his head . " I thought a few weeks at Tadmor would convince you further resistance is quite futile . Evidently I was mistaken . " He took one of the drinks in his hand and almost spilled it . The condensation on the outside of the glass made it slippery . " Or maybe my men have been too gentle . In any event , it seems they 've failed to show you exactly how serious I am . " A drop of perspiration rolled down Dov 's nose and onto his shirt . The dry heat invaded every cavity of his body . There was pressure on the sockets of his eyes . His mouth was viscid . His nostrils parched . His throat felt like someone had run sandpaper along its inner walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Second Bureau chief set his glass down . " I 'm sorry I ca n't do that , at least not yet . But as soon as you begin cooperating you shall have a glass of Kortisan . It 's a local specialty , made by soaking licorice roots in water for several days . The result , chilled , is quite delicious . I 'm sure you 'll find it . . . " " Why do n't you just kill me and get it over with ! " Dov shouted . " I 'm afraid that would do neither of us much good . Besides you are too young to lose your life . Believe me , at twenty-six you 've barely begun . I know , I have a son and daughter about your age . " There was paternal warmth in his voice . " I do n't want to see you dead . As  | I 've told you before , I want to help you , to send you back to Israel . In fact , let me do something now , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flipped a switch on the wall . The whine of an electric motor sounded overhead and the black blades of the fan suspended from the ceiling gradually picked up speed . Dov shivered as a stream of hot air glanced off his sweaty brow . " Is that better ? " He nodded . " Good . Now , tell me  --  what do you know about the former Nazis living in Damascus ? " " Which Nazis ? " " How did you penetrate the German colony here ? " Sarraj demanded impatiently . Dov 's lips curved into a smile . " I just asked where I could find the best knockwurst and sauerkraut in town . " Sarraj strummed his fingers on the desk . " If you persist in this manner , I 'll have the answer beaten out of you . I will ask just one more time . How did you penetrate the Nazi colony ? " A long silence followed . Sarraj stood up . " You are a fool . You will regret this , I promise you . " He motioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door behind Sarraj , then turned toward the prisoner . " Over here , " he said . Dov lowered himself to the ground and looked over to where the Arab pointed . Two wrist shackles were bolted into the wall just above the casing . As he moved near , the guard grabbed his shoulder , pushed him face forward against the door , lifted his right hand , locked it inside the manacle , then did the same with his left . Dov hung over  | the door . The wood felt warm where it pressed against his cheek . He heard the sound of the kurbash beating the air , then abruptly the first blow ripped into his infected calves . The bull 's hair shredded his prison garment and the outer layer of his skin with one stroke . Dov bit his lower lip hard . Again and again the guard lashed at the hack of his legs , cutting through tendon and muscle , bloodying his whip . Dov tore at the shackles , writhing in agony . Streams of sweat ran down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nose . The guard paused for a moment , stepped to his left , then sent the ends of the kurbash slicing through the side of Dov 's knee . The second blow struck the exposed peroneal nerve . Excruciating pain clawed down Dov 's leg and exploded into his foot . His tongue caught in his throat . He screamed without restraint . The door opened . Sarraj stood there for a long time , studying the boy 's face . Finally he spoke in a soft voice : " Have you had enough ? " Dov turned his head away . " Take him down , " Sarraj said to the guard . When Dov was seated on the stool , Sarraj reached into his desk and withdrew a gun . It was an FN Browning .45 caliber High Power Automatic Pistol manufactured in Belgium under license as a copy of the American original . He circled around the desk and faced the young Israeli . " I have lost my patience , Elon . I did not bring you to al-Mazza for you to waste more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our discussions . Either you begin cooperating or you will not leave this room alive . " His voice was flat . Dov felt the control of his mind slipping . His head 5  | throbbed . And the thirst . " Sarraj , give me something to drink , " he cried out . Sarraj sensed that he was on the verge of victory . He lowered the Browning to his side . He had now only to apply the coup d'gr &ce.; But he would edge toward his final threat . He knew better than to spoil his advantage by proceeding too quickly . " Why did the Colonel send you to Syria ? " " Please , Sarraj , my legs . Let me lie down . " " In a minute . There 's a doctor waiting in the next room . As soon as I have the information I want you shall have treatment , a bed , food . Now , tell me , how did you penetrate the Nazi colony ? " " No , " he whispered , weakening . Moisture built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will be over for you . In a few days you 'll be home . Think about it , no more beatings , an end to the pain . " Dov licked his lower lip ; it was bleeding . " Nobody ever holds out under prolonged torture . You 've been here for five months . The Colonel will understand . Nobody will blame you . You 'll be considered a hero for lasting as long as you did . Please do n't make me use the pistol . You made a special effort to seek out the Nazis . Tell me , did Ludwig Streicher help you ? " " I ca n't , " he shouted , burying his head in his arms ? waiting , wanting to die . Sarraj moved next to the chair , gun in hand . " You leave me little choice . " Dov looked up . The pistol was pointed at his elbow . In one terrible instant he realized Sarraj was not threatening to kill him . " You would n't ... " " The bullets for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ends . They 'll shatter on impact . Why did you come to Syria ? " " The Colonel sent me . " " I know that , " Sarraj said , the anger in his voice scratching his words . " Why ? " " I ca n't tell you . " " I 'm not bluffing ! " Sarraj pushed the muzzle of the Browning against Dov 's skin . " Who is your contact in Damascus ? " " I have no contact here . " " You 're lying ! Who is Operative Sixty-six ? " At the mention of the highly placed Israeli agent terror swept through Dov . How had Sarraj known ? It was impossible . But no time to think now . He had to focus his will against Sarraj . Defy him . Resist . That 's all that mattered . " I 'll give you one last chance . I want the identity of Operative Sixty-six . " Silence . " I want his name ! " Sarraj screamed . " Now ! " Dov stared into his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gritting his teeth . Sarraj pulled the trigger . The sound exploding in such close quarters was deafening . Pieces of flesh splattered the wall . Blood gushed from the open wound . Dov 's arm , hanging from the elbow by a piece of membrane , swayed in the air . Then the skin tore and it fell to the ground . " Get a doctor , " Sarraj shouted at the guard . " I do n't want him dying . " 7  | THE MAN KNOWN as Hans Hoffmann cried out in his sleep . Jarred awake , Michelle shook the naked body beside her until his eyes opened . Slowly he stirred . Drawing his hand from under the covers he touched her cheek , seeking palpable proof that she was real and the dream was not . " Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? " Michelle asked in French . For a split second Hans did n't understand her . The dream had been in German , that dream from his youth was always in German . " What do you mean , is anything the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to her language . " You cried out . " He shrugged and turned onto his back . " I must have been dreaming . It 's nothing to worry about . An occasional nightmare is healthy , it releases tension . " Comforted by an explanation , she smiled and hooked her foot around his . The night air brushing through the curtain bore the damp odor of the sea and the pines outside . Though Hans 's eyes were open , the dream was still there : the mud , the barking dogs , the barbed wire . Michelle sensed his thoughts , still clinging to the night-  | mare . Helping the only way she knew how , she drew him close and brought their lips together . Her mouth worked , arousing him . Strands of her long black hair embraced his face and she felt his response to her breasts . Slowly she rolled her tongue from his ear to the base of his neck and back again . He reached for her ; the memories had been put back in their place . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the white hillside cabin looking down at the Cyprus coastline . Ten miles to the east lay Kyrenia , a hamletlike fishing village , plaster and red tile roofs . Below the town fishing smacks and small boats were sheltered inside two arms of a sea wall that formed a miniature harbor . On one arm stood the Virgin Castle . The other arm was a quay with a lighthouse at the end . Anchored outside the harbor , flying a red flag with a gold crescent , was the 3,500-ton M. Feuza Cakmak , a World War II vintage destroyer stationed there ever since Turkey first landed six thousand troops on the island in July , 1974 . The white cabin Michelle had rented stood in the midst of a forest of pines and acacias . Behind them rose the Kyrenia mountains , whose terraced vineyards and olive orchards reflected the early morning light . Above the orchards , atop a three-thousand-foot peak , St. Hilarion 's Castle stood guard over the rolling hills to the west . Though inhabited more than seven hundred years earlier by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartments , great halls , monastery , and fortifications have been preserved , intact . On their way down to the beach Hans and Michelle saw no one . She had chosen the cabin with care . The nearest neighbors were several miles away . Michelle wanted to stay away from any place where they might be  | seen . She said she was married . Hans did n't mind one way or the other . As they moved along the water 's edge Michelle noticed , and not for the first time , that he had an attractive physique . He was strong  --  she had discerned that the night before  --  but now walking without his shirt , she could see the muscles in his arms and shoulders . A shade under six feet , his small blue eyes , charming manner , and ability to put strangers at ease made people remember him when they returned home from a crowded party . Occasionally it struck those he was close to that they really knew little about him . His name sounded German and indeed in most Berlin nightclubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , for he was known equally well by the maitre d 's in Paris and Buenos Aires . At Christy 's in London , his checks , drawn on an obscure Argentinian bank , were accepted without question . After hundreds of grueling hours with teachers and tapes he 'd mastered four languages , all without the trace of an accent . He was difficult to place . In fact , natives of England , Germany , France , and Argentina all assumed he was born in their country . It would never have occurred to them to think otherwise . Hans and Michelle continued to walk for a long time without speaking . When they finally reached the beach he stopped . " I 'm going for a swim . Would you like to come ? " he asked , placing a kiss on her forehead . She shook her head . " I 'll just lie out in the sun for awhile . " " Fine , I wo n't be long . " As he shed his sandals and watch , Michelle removed a blanket from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smoothing down the lumps of sand with her hand . Hans walked into the Mediterranean and dove headfirst into a churning wave , the saltwater filling his mouth . With a series of powerful strokes he propelled himself away from the shore . When he was in quiet water , out past the waves , he flipped onto his back and floated , offering no resistance to the drop and lift of the swells . Though his eyes were shut , the glare of the sun penetrated his skull . The water felt cold in comparison to the warm air . After awhile Hans almost succeeded in purging himself of all thoughts . Almost . He knew he should return immediately to his apartment in Nicosia . He should not be away when the weekly transmission was due in from Damascus ; but the trip to Kyrenia was worth the risk . For months the cable traffic had been routine , and Michelle was a telephone operator at the Syrian Embassy  --  cultivating her favor might produce large rewards . Besides , he was tired , he deserved a rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he tried to convince himself . In the evening while she prepared dinner he built a fire in the pit outside the cabin . When the wood began to burn freely he sat on the ground and listened to the sounds of the surf pounding the rocks scattered along the coastline . He 'd met Michelle several weeks ago . He 'd seen her half a dozen times at the Ottoman Bank on Stasinos Avenue , a block from the Syrian Embassy ; but it was not until he discovered she worked at the Arab legation that he approached her and struck up a conversation . When Michelle brought out the skewers of souvlaki he took the handles and held the rows of beef , green peppers , and onions over the crackling flame . He liked his meat singed on the outside but rare on the inside . It  | reminded him of people , encased by a shell of defenses , which when permeated leads to a soft , tender core . " I 've got Cokinelli and Pella , " Michelle said . " Which would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , choosing the semidry over the very dry Greek wine . She returned in a moment with a tray bearing a tomato , cucumber , and avocado salad as well as the Pella . She lowered it to the grass area in front of the cabin , poured the red wine , and set the full glasses down by the settings she 'd already arranged on wooden placeboards . " The meat 's ready , " he said , moving toward her . As he slid the beef , onions , and peppers off the skewers and onto their plates , she dished out the salad . The smell of the souvlaki filled the air . Michelle bit into a piece of meat causing the juice to trickle down her chin . She smiled and wiped it away with a napkin . Hans speared a large chunk of beef with his fork and popped it into his mouth . His face contorted , he grabbed at the Pella and drank , mixing the cold wine with the hot meat . " Did you burn yourself ? " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green pepper off her plate , leaned over , and slipped it into his mouth . He chewed it slowly . " Are you married ? " she asked suddenly . Hans thought about his wife and their childless union . It had been over three years since he 'd seen her . He promised he 'd try and be home for his fiftieth birthday six months ago , but he 'd been unable to make it . At least he 'd called . " No , I 've never been married , " he said . " A wise decision . " " Maybe . "  | " Have you ever considered marrying ? I mean , you must meet dozens of attractive , intelligent women in the import-export business . " " Like yourself ? " he teased her . She laughed . " You forget , I 'm already married . " He snapped his fingers . " It completely slipped my mind . " She put her knife and fork down and playfully lunged at him , pushing his shoulders to the grass and pinning them there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michelle smiled . " I do n't know . I have n't thought that far ahead . " " Well I have . " He kissed her , tasting the Pella on her breath , and reached for the zipper at the back of her blouse . " Let me help , " she said . He nodded and she rolled to the side . They undressed in silence , the light from the fire creating shadows that danced among the trees . The night air felt warm against their naked bodies . Hans lay on his back with her head on his chest , but for some reason his thoughts were elsewhere . Shattered specks of light pierced the heavens . He stared into the sky , made out the constellation Orion and tried to distinguish the colors of its four perimeter stars . Failing , he closed his eyes and listened to the interminable silence of the dark hunter , who seemed somehow to be trying to tell him something . " What 's the matter ? " Michelle asked . " Nothing . " " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and silently ran her nails along his spine . She really did n't care if he told her what was 16  | on his mind or not . Her assignment was not to understand him , not to extract information from him ; but to keep him occupied , away from his apartment in the heart of Cyprus , away from his radio transmitter , away from the message he should have been receiving . . 17  | PRESSURE BUILT in Hans 's ears and he felt the landing gear lock into position . Preparing for arrival , he took the white plastic coffee cup off the tray in front of him and handed it to a passing stewardess . " How soon are we due in Frankfurt ? " he asked her . " We 'll be landing at Rein-Main Field in seven minutes . " He thought about the ever punctilious Germans . It would not do for a Lufthansa stewardess to say five minutes , or ten minutes , when the precise figure was seven . Three weeks had passed since Hans was ordered to liquidate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was to be reassigned immediately . He supposed he was . Agents simply were not presented with vacations or sabbatical leaves . Not that he minded ; he could n't think of anything he would want to do with time off . There was a ping above his head . He fastened his seatbelt and sank deeper into the cushion . He lacked any feeling of well-being now that the Cyprus operation was over . He thought only of the next mission . Karl Richtman met Hans at the terminal , quickly ush-  | ered him into a small , beige Mercedes 250c , then sped out of the airport , accelerating rapidly onto the autobahn . Hans knew the route well . It was a short six miles along the Main River to the city . " Where are you taking me ? " Hans asked , as they raced through the wooded German countryside . " Nowhere . I 'm just going to drive long enough to make sure you were n't followed , then I 'll head back to the airport . You have a flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated before asking the next question . " Where am I going ? " Richtman looked sideways at him . " You 're going home . " Hans 's face bore no expression of the emotion he felt . " For how long ? " " I have n't been told . " He paused for a moment . " Would you like it to be permanent ? " Hans looked out at the tree-lined highway . Tall cypresses bent and straightened in the breeze . " I do n't know . I have n't given the idea much thought . " " There is a limit to how long one can stay out there . I 've been in Germany for two years and I can hardly wait to get home . You must he tired . " " Not too tired , " Hans snapped . " I did n't mean that , " Richtman said apologetically . Hans sensed that he did . " We just heard there was some trouble on Cyprus . " " Is anyone following us ? " Richtman looked into the rear-view mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the all-clear signal . " " Good . " Richtman swung the Mercedes off the autobahn and proceeded to the airport via a secondary highway . A strained silence separated the two men as the car darted  | through the traffic . Finally Hans turned and placed his hand on Karl 's shoulder . " I 'm sorry if I was short with you , but you hit me with quite a surprise . It 's been awhile since I was home . " Richtman smiled . " I understand . It must be a long time since you 've seen your wife . " " Three years , and then it was only for a month . " " It 's rough . You know , I missed my son 's graduation from the university . " Richtman paused for a moment . " Maybe men like us have no right to marry . " Hans did n't respond . As they parked in front of the departure terminal Richtman reached into his coat pocket . " Give me your Hans Hoffmann papers and I 'll give you your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passport Richtman extended across the seat . Holding it in his hand , he fingered the gold embossed letters on the vinyl cover . " You have n't forgotten who you are ? " Richtman said jokingly . " No . " Major Ari Ben-Sion of the Mossad Haelion Lemodiin Ubitachon , his country 's supreme intelligence agency , slipped his Israeli passport into his coat pocket and headed for the El Al departure lounge . As the Boeing 707 inched its way over the Aegean Sea , Ari took a final sip of his J &; B , then lay back and closed his eyes . There was so much to think about , so many loose ends to tie up in Israel ; but he preferred not to deal with any of that before he landed . He would sort out his life later . Now he would sleep . He was jarred awake as the tires , locked into position below the wings , banged down on the concrete runway . The plane surged forward in the air , bounced , and began 20  | to slow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window , Ari saw that the lettering over the terminal read BEN GURION INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT . It had been LOD AIRPORT the last time he 'd landed . As he cleared customs he noticed the young men in olive uniform , short-muzzled Uzi submachine guns in hand , stationed at strategic points throughout the terminal . Not everything changes , he mumbled to himself , heading for the car rental desk . He gave the clerk his name , signed a form , and she handed him the keys to a car parked in stall number fourteen , directly across from the Egged bus stop . The Colonel , knowing Ari preferred to come in alone , always left him a vehicle . Outside the odor of jet fuel hung in the air . Pushing a shopping-cart-like baggage carrier , Ari threaded his way past the sheirut drivers , loudly beckoning arriving passengers to share a taxi to Tel Aviv or Jerusalem , and headed toward the bus stop . The yellow and blue number 401 bus , idling in the street , black exhaust spewing from its rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aviv . Behind him at the Wimpy stand , hamburger patties were cooking on a greasy grill . Though Ari had slept through the meal on the plane he was n't hungry . With the grinding of gears the bus pulled out and sped toward the security checkpoint just before the Petah Tikvah-Ramla highway . Ari looked across the street . At the end of a row of empty stalls were two cars , a Peugeot 504 and an Israeli Susita . The numbers painted on the ground along the stalls had worn away and were illegible . Ari pushed the cart toward the Peugeot , his hands vibrating as the wheels rolled over the rough asphalt . Reaching into his pocket , he pulled out the keys the receptionist had given him , found the round-ended one , and inserted it in the 21  | lock . It would n't turn . He tried the other one . The result was the same . Looking at the keys more closely , he saw that the imprint on them was in Hebrew . He took hold of the cart and pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Speeding into the Ramla junction , Ari veered to the left , choosing the familiar road that wound below the Latrun Monastery 's terraced vineyards . Bypassing the highway that cut through the Arab village of Abu Gosh , where David had kept the Ark of the Covenant for two decades waiting to enter the holy city , would delay his arrival in Jerusalem by twenty minutes . But the Abu Gosh route was new  --  for that reason he avoided it . On both sides of the road pines soared abruptly above the flat kibbutz fields , silent sentinels marking the entrance to Bab el Wad , the Gate of the Valley . From there Ari entered a narrow gorge and for twenty-five miles the ribbon of concrete climbed and twisted through rock and forest , cresting two thousand feet above the coastal plain . At several points on the side of the road lay the scorched steel skeletons remaining from the convoy that broke through to Jerusalem in the 1948 War of Independence . In a country where the past is a national obsession , they were constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time Ari reached the outskirts of Romema and entered the city . Driving down Weizmann Street , he noticed that a new , cylindrical building , appearing about twenty stories high , had risen across from the central bus station . Though he 'd never seen the windowed tower before , he knew it was a Hilton Hotel ? he 'd stayed in an identical structure in Nairobi . Turning into Ruppin Street , he proceeded into the rocky valley watched over by the Hebrew University on one side and the Knesseth , the Israeli Parliament , on the other . Ari 22  | halted in front of a row of brown government buildings , built of stone , and left the car by the curb , under a sign that read NO PARKING AT ANY TIME . A few lights dotted the facade of the end building , nearest the Knesseth . One of them would be the Colonel 's . He always worked late . Ari bypassed the steel-reinforced front door , certain to be locked now , and moved down a narrow concrete walkway to the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and headed into the enclosed stairwell , a yellow light flashed on the security guard 's desk in the lobby . Looking up at his overhead closed-circuit TV screen , the army sergeant followed the intruder 's movements . Moments later Ari entered the small , dimly lit lobby and faced the boyish-looking sergeant . " Ben-Sion to see the Colonel , " he said . The security guard pointed a commanding finger at the stranger . " Wait right there . " Lowering his arm , he reached for the cables on the switchboard behind the desk and dialed the third floor . It took a few seconds for the Colonel to answer and tell the guard to send the man up . When he turned to do so , Ben-Sion was gone . Ari walked hurriedly through the quiet corridors , not wanting to slow down and let the memories catch up with him . Reaching the Colonel 's office , he paused for a moment , then entered without knocking . The Colonel moved out from behind his desk , and the two men hugged , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " the Colonel said , breaking the embrace . " Three years . " " It seems even longer . " He reached for a small box on his desk and held it toward Ari . " Will you have a cigar ? " They 're Dunhill Montecruz , hand-made in the Canary Islands and most mild . Take one . " Ari withdrew one of the cedar-lined aluminum tubes , unscrewed the cap , and 23  | slipped out the cigar . But before he could strike a match the Colonel produced a lighter . Ari took it from him , lit the cigar , and handed the lighter back . " Excuse me , you must be tired , " the Colonel said apologetically . " All the traveling and time change . Do sit down . " As the Colonel moved behind the desk Ari dropped into a chair and cautiously faced the pudgy , balding man who was responsible for the security of the State of Israel . There had been no time change , Ari thought to himself ; the hour he 'd lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle East . The Colonel knew that . " There were no problems with the flights , were there ? " " No . " " You met Karl in Frankfurt ? " Ari nodded . Of course he met Richtman in Frankfurt , how the hell else would he be in Jerusalem now . The Colonel rose and moved to shut the window behind him . " We had a horrid winter this year  --  five feet of snow and no equipment to move it . The city was virtually paralyzed . " " I heard about it , " Ari said , trying to push the impatience from his voice . The Colonel was exactly as Ari had remembered him : the slight smile , the verbal banality , the talking of trivia . He 'd continued that way , probing for weak spots until his victim was caught off balance and easily tripped up . " I hope they 've warned you about the inflation ; you 're going to find food prices up something frightful since you were here last . We 've been forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ari nodded dutifully . The Colonel sat down , pushing aside the redbannered afternoon edition of Maariv he 'd not yet found time to read . " You know , Ari , I remember when you first  | entered the Service . You 'd been at Deganya less than a year and already you were bored with kibbutz life . Running the British blockade three months after being liberated from Dachau had its effect . You 'd caught the smell of adventure , martyrdom , nobility . Those qualities were no good to us , but we found beneath all that crap there was a sense of mission , of survival . So I took you , and my hunch proved to be right . Within two years you became one of my most valuable agents . " There was an uncomfortable pause , the silence broken only by the sound of an electric clock buzzing on the wall behind the Colonel 's desk . Finally , Ari took a deep drag on his cigar and spoke . " I was away from my receiver the twelfth of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indeed , " the Colonel said , as if Ari 's words contained information he did not already possess . " A bit unlike you , " he added , lighting a Montecruz for himself . " I was following a lead near Kyrenia . " The Colonel screwed the top back on the cigar tube ; he saved them for his grandchildren . " Did anything come of it ? " " No . It was a dead end . " " I see . " " It happens ! " Ari said . " Yes , it does . " The Colonel nodded understandingly . " Dead ends eventually confront us all . " The Mossad chief placed his glasses on the desk , rubbed his eyes , then looked up . " Ari , I was wondering if you 'd had enough ? " " I do n't understand . " " I was wondering if you were worn out , tired , if you wanted to quit spying . " He could n't believe what the Colonel was saying . " You mean , do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was a long silence , each second seeming interminable . " I 'd rather not , " Ari said finally . The Colonel puffed on his cigar , then allowed the smoke to drift from his mouth . " I thought you 'd say that . " He knocked a short length of ash into the wastebasket at his feet . " Ari , I 've got only three operations that are worth anything , and Hans Hoffmann is one of them . Your work 's been of tremendous value to us , but even the best agents ca n't remain out there all the time . Everyone has to come in periodically , otherwise the loneliness  --  it becomes too strong to fight . Then , inevitably . . . " The Colonel stopped in midsentence and put his glasses back on . " Maybe we 've made a mistake , maybe we 've neglected you for too long . Maybe it 's time . " Ari thought about all the airports and train stations he 'd been in , the all-night vigils he 'd undertaken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake and warm while his adversary slept in a heated apartment across the street . " Time for what ? " Ari said at last . " I do n't understand what you 're saying . What is it you want me to do ? " The Colonel leaned back in his chair . " I want you to take a few refresher courses  --  physical exercise , instruction in the use of some of the new explosives , that sort of thing . Ari , I want you to keep sharp . There are a lot of young agents on the way up who are begging for field assignment . I ca n't keep them in the background indefinitely . " Ari said nothing so the Colonel went on . " And of course while you 're here I 'll want to make use of your experience ; you might think about giving a few lectures and possibly you could spend some time in Operational Planning . I would n't be surprised if you came up with a  | suggestion or two . Some of those armchair theorists on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Abruptly the Colonel ground out his cigar . " But enough of this for now . You just got in . You have n't even been home . We can talk again another time . " " Does Yael know I 'm here ? " Ari asked . The Colonel nodded . " I had one of the girls phone a while ago and tell her you were due back this week . She 's pretty shaky . I thought it best she had some time to prepare herself . " Ari rose . " Is that all ? " " I should think so . " The Colonel moved across the room and accompanied him to the door . " Take as long as you need ; when you 're ready , report to Yehuda Shamir in room 312 . He 'll debrief you and arrange those refresher courses I mentioned . " " I 'll be in tomorrow , " Ari said flatly . Opening the door , he stepped into the hall , then turned back . " What about the car ? " " Oh that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're settled . " Ari nodded and moved slowly down the corridor . Outside , he pushed up the collar of his jacket and walked along the empty street , listening to the echo of his footsteps . Lights shone from the windows of Givat Ram , the dormitories at the back of the Hebrew University campus . Ari wondered what it would have been like to attend a university . He kicked at an empty Goldstar beer can and sent it spinning into the rocks and weeds along the side of the road . Such speculation was pointless ; he was only stalling . He shrugged and retraced his steps back toward the Susita . The Colonel had been even vaguer than usual . Ari wondered why . Driving down Yafo Road into the heart of the New City , he turned left on Straus Street , passed the Bikur  | Holim Hospital and headed into Mea Shearim , the orthodox quarter of Jerusalem . Though it was late , and the streets were virtually deserted , while Ari waited at a red light two frail men wearing long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curb and crossed in front of the Susita . Strolling arm in arm to lend each other support , they prodded the pavement with their sticks as they walked . Buried from dawn to dusk in the timeless world of books it was only at night that they ventured out for a breath of fresh air . After they 'd passed , Ari eased down on the accelerator . Minutes later the street climbed the steep hill that opened into the northernmost tip of the city  --  Ramat Eshkol , a Ili , ' fashionable suburb built on land taken from Jordan during the Six Day War . Ari parked the car in front of number 12 Mitla Pass Road and ran his eyes along the rows of five-story stone buildings and manicured flower gardens , so characteristic of the newer sections of Jerusalem . All the streets in Ramat Eshkol : Nahal Zin , Straits of Tiran Street , Mishmar Ha vul Parran Road , Ramat 11 HaGolan Road , Midbar Sinai Way , were named after the sites of Israeli victories in the 1967 fighting . No street names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kippur War . Ari mounted the stone steps at the base of the building and pushed the red button on the wall to his left . Immediately the dark corridors were bathed in light . He now had sixty seconds to reach his door before the lights automatically shut off . Energy was conserved here . Suddenly the sound of several of Jerusalem 's ubiquitous alley cats rose from the basement , their hissing and shrieking reverberating through the narrow corridors of the building . Ignoring them , Ari climbed the stairs to the fifth floor , inserted a key in the door at the end of the  | hall , and pushed himself inside  --  as if he were accustomed to doing so daily . Yael was asleep on the couch . A black and white test pattern shone from the television ; a half-empty bottle of Carmel 777 cognac lay on its side on the floor . Ari stood motionless at the entrance to the living room , surprised at how old his wife looked . Streaks of gray ran through her once ash-brown hair , and deep lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved into the room and shut off the television set . She stirred groggily . Though he had ceased to love his wife long ago , it pained him to see her like this . " Yael , " he whispered as she slipped back into the fog accompanying alcoholic sleep . At the sound of her name she opened her eyes . " Ari , " she half cried . He bent down and stroked her tangled hair . At the touch of his hand she stiffened , and buried her head in the cushion . He reached across the couch and gently took hold of her shoulder . " No . " She pushed his hand away , squeezing it as she did . " Yael ... " " Go away . Why did you have to come back now , after so long . " " They want me to stay in Israel  --  for awhile . " " What difference will that make ? " She turned away and pushed herself deeper in the couch . " I do n't feel well , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you something hot to drink . " He rose and went into the kitchen without waiting for her to answer . Rummaging through the refrigerator , he could n't find a bottle of milk . About to close the door and look in the cupboard for a jar of instant  | coffee he suddenly realized the plastic bag , mounted in the white holder he 'd shoved to the side , contained milk . He took it out , warmed some , removed the skin which she hated , and brought a steaming mug into the living room . Yael lay passed out on the couch , clutching the open cognac bottle in her arms . Ari set the milk down and removed the 777 from her grip . She mumbled something incomprehensible . Lifting his wife 's unresisting body in his arms , he carried her into her room , drew back the bed covers , and slipped her underneath them  --  noticing as he left that a handful of multicolored pills were scattered over the nightstand . Restless , he opened the sliding glass door and stepped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ari looked into the distance and imagined he could make out the ring of lights that surround Jerusalem like satellites : to the east , Jerico ; to the north , Ramallah ; to the south , Bethlehem . Closer by , atop a high peak to the west , the tower of Nebi Samuel stood silhouetted in the bluish white moonlight . There the prophet who lent his name to the peak sat in judgment over the nation of Israel ; followed nine hundred years later by the Maccabees , who fasted on the same spot before they swept down on the Romans occupying their city . Ari had hiked to Nebi Samuel many times . From there , staring across the Bab el Wad valley , Jerusalem looked like a metropolis cast randomly atop a series of desolate mountains , with no rivers , no sustaining fields , in fact no reason for existing , except the belief in men 's minds . Ari stood there for a long time thinking about what the Colonel had said , wondering how long it would be before he was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell asleep on the couch . Rising early the following morning , he left the apartment , drove to the Sanhedria Pension in the Bukharian quarter just outside Mea Shearim , and rented a room . 31  | IN THE SUMMER of 1947 , after being warned that the Zbrojovka Brno arms works in Prague would deal only with the authorized representative of a sovereign nation , a young , virtually untried Haganah intelligence lieutenant managed to acquire eight signed and sealed blank letterheads from the Paris legation of Ethiopia . The desperately ill-equipped provisional Jewish government in Palestine was immediately able to purchase ten thousand Model E-18 Mausers , one hundred MG-34 submachine guns , and several million accompanying cartridges . No one asked where the letterheads came from . Ari did not volunteer an explanation . Then a decade later a mysterious sabotage incident occurred at the outbreak of the Sinai Campaign . At dawn on October 29 , 1956 , a Soviet Ilyushin with half the Egyptian General Staff on board plunged into the Mediterranean somewhere off the coast of Lebanon . In its baggage compartment was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his wife . It had been purchased at a discount from a recently opened import-export firm , Hans Hoffmann Ltd . And now  --  refresher courses . After Ari was debriefed Yehuda Shamir gave him a  | dog-eared Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Manual , explaining that it was better than anything they had in Hebrew , and suggested he work out on his own . There had been a time when Ari daily did calisthenics before breakfast , but over the years , he could n't remember exactly when , he 'd replaced the knee bends with coffee and a cigarette . Following the Canadian system he exercised each morning for twenty minutes . After the fifth day he accidentally misplaced the manual . He did n't ask for another one . On the pistol range Ari discovered , much to his surprise , that his aim was way off . He checked out a Llama Model VIII 9-mm automatic pistol , choosing the nineshot .38 over the seven-shot .45 , and began practicing an hour each afternoon . After a few days his accuracy improved considerably , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores were still kept on file in the room on the second floor of the walled police compound directly across from the central post office on Yafo Road . Ari was given some instruction in the new uses of explosives . The Colonel was particularly fond of tetryl , a high-power charge made from dimethylaniline and nitric acid , which when inserted in a tobacco pipe or ballpoint pen turned those implements into lethal weapons ? but these lessons were occasional and brief . Ari spent most of his time in Operational Planning . Due to his familiarity with London he was asked to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting , as quasi-operatives , a number of the numerous East End Jewish taxicab drivers who regularly made the run to Heathrow Airport . Theoretically at least , he read from a file , it should be possible for them to queue in the ranks outside incoming Soviet and Arab flights , pick up specially targeted passengers , and rifle 33  | their briefcases which normally were placed in the empty space next to the driver , below the rear-riding customer 's field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive and negative aspects of the plan , including in it an additional section on the possible consequences to his country 's relations with England should one of the cab drivers be caught and confess that he was working for the Israeli government . Ari was in favor of mounting the operation , but to protect Israel he strongly suggested the Mossad limit its contact to one carefully selected British Jew , who could then do the necessary recruiting under the auspices of a local fringe movement , possibly the Heirut party . Ari wrote his report rapidly in the hope that the sooner he finished , the closer he would be to a field assignment . In actuality his superiors were so pleased at the speed and insight with which he completed his analysis of the projected operation that the case histories of three Egyptian agents , earmarked for study by the Colonel 's administrative aides , were diverted to his desk . The weeks bumped into each other . A month passed , followed by another , then another . The paperwork piled up . As soon as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drink , not a lot , but more than he had before . He firmly believed the solution to personal difficulties was rigorous self-discipline . Knowing exactly how much Scotch he could swallow before his intellectual capabilities diminished , he never exceeded that limit . But recently he 'd been reaching it more often . Several times Ari spoke to the Colonel , requesting reassignment to Europe . Cordial as always , the Colonel praised him lavishly for the work he 'd done since returning to Israel , but said little else . Growing increasingly restless as he realized he was becoming more than a 34  | temporary pencil and paper pusher , Ari pressed for a date when he could plan on going abroad . The Colonel intimated that he did n't have one and did n't know when he would . In the meantime , he added , the Service must utilize each man where he was most needed . For once Ari fully understood him . Everyone in intelligence life paid homage to that sacrament . Unknown to Ari there was quite a lot of whispering going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch hours . Everyone seemed to be speculating about the reason for his reassignment to Operational Planning , but nobody could get close enough to him to learn his side of the story . It was rumored he 'd made a mistake on Cyprus , that somehow he was connected to the capture of Dov Elon in Damascus , and did n't even know it . No one was sure of the facts . All agreed , though , that in his time he 'd been one of the best field agents the Mossad ever had . And probably still was , many thought . From the Bukharian quarter Ari walked toward the center of town . The afternoon was warm and pleasant . Soon he passed the black and white sawhorses drawn across Yehezkel Street by the police at sundown every Friday night to keep vehicles out of Mea Shearim during the twenty-four-hour Sabbath observance . Inside the orthodox quarter young men in their white , open-throated shirts and girls in white Sabbath dresses laced with colored embroidery mixed comfortably with the bearded Jews wearing long black gabardines and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriages through the open streets . Ari was hungry . Generally he took his meals at the Restaurant Stark on King George Road , but on Satur-35  | days , when the Jewish restaurants in Jerusalem were closed , he walked into the Old City and patronized the Arabs . Crossing toward the police barrier at the end of Straus Street that marked the southern boundary of Mea Shearirn , Ari noticed a young woman , partially hidden in the shadow of the massive Histadrut building , pointing a camera with a telephoto lens at a bearded , blackgarbed Jew seated on a stone step near the corner . Hurriedly he moved toward her . " I would n't do that , " he said in English . Her clothing and her expensive Nikon photographic equipment told him she was one of the numerous American tourists who invaded Israel in the summer . " What ? " she said , lowering her camera and revealing a striking face . Ari pointed toward the old man . " He would consider it a personal affront and a desecration of the Sabbath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't realize . " Her cheeks reddened . " Thank you for telling me . " The woman , tall , apparently in her late twenties , had blue-gray eyes shaded by dark lashes , and dimples that deepened when she talked . The front strands of her champagne-colored hair , parted down the middle , curled as they fell along the sides of her face . She wore a V-cut peasant blouse exposing a gold necklace and the upper curves of wellformed breasts . Her nails were long and clear ; Ari immediately noticed that she used little makeup . " Your accent . " She hooked her camera strap over one shoulder . " Are you British ? " " Something like that , " he said , anticipating the next series of questions and knowing his pride would prevent him from telling her he was a former spy put out to pasture to tend a flock of papers . " That 's encouraging . These Israelis have been driving 36  | me crazy . They 're all hands . " She smiled , suddenly seeing his small blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim Johnson . " " Hans Hoffmann , " he said , returning her smile . " And do n't worry about the local men , if anyone becomes excessively aggressive just give him a curt bli yadayim . It means hands off . He 'll get the message . " " Bli yadayim , " she repeated out loud . " Thank you , I 'll make use of that . " She picked up the leather case at her feet . " You 'll have to excuse me but I must be heading back to my hotel . I did n't realize the restaurants would be closed and I have n't eaten since this morning . " She slipped her camera in the case and zipped the top closed . " Thanks again for the advice . " She turned and started to walk toward Yafo Road . He stood there for a moment . The last months had been unbearably lonely .. . " Wait a second , " he said , catching up with her . " I was just going to have an early dinner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She hesitated . " I know a great place , the Golden Arabesque Restaurant . It 's got everything : ceiling-to-ceiling Oriental rugs , arched wooden porticos , hanging beads , camel saddles for seats . " " Does it have food too ? " " Of course . They serve the most exquisite Middle Eastern cuisine south of Beirut  --  tender mansaf , savory kebab , succulent chicken . So , are you coming ? " A smile etched her lips . " Sure , why not ? " As they walked toward the Old City Ari thought about how alone he was  --  then pushed the realization out of his mind . Yafo Road , its shops shuttered , its sidewalks deserted , testified to Jerusalem 's rigorous observance of the day of 37  | rest , differing from sections of the country , like heretical Haifa , where buses and some businesses operated seven days a week . Reaching the end of Yafo Road , they gazed upon the walls of the Old City , proud barriers imprisoning Old Jerusalem in a massive belt of stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages were sixty thousand people : Jews , Moslems , Christians , and Armenians  --  each sealed by race and rite into separate quarters . Ari bypassed Yafo Gate , certain to be crowded with tourists and nonreligious Israelis , and they entered the Old City via Damascus Gate , across from the East Jerusalem bus station and the spires of St. Stephen 's Church . Passing through the walls , they mounted a ceramic-tile staircase leading to the Golden Arabesque Restaurant . Inside , rows of hanging beads divided the dimly lit dining room into semi-private cubicles . Bowing in welcome , the maitre d ' guided them to a low carved-legged table , surrounded by red pillows , and bearing a round brass tray for a top . An Oriental rug blanketed the floor . Lanterns hung from the ceiling . Wailing music , turned low , played in the background . " What about the camel saddle seats ? " Kim asked as they settled onto the soft cushions . " If you would like one , " the maitre d ' said . " At another of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . " After the maitre d ' handed them menus and left , she turned to Ari . " You were n't kidding about the saddles , were you ? " " No . " He glanced at the menu , then closed it . " Do you like lamb ? " She nodded , knocking the brass table with her knee as she shifted position . " Good . It 's the only thing to order in an Arab restaurant . Most of the beef in the Middle East comes from 38  | Argentina . It loses something during the voyage . " He motioned to the waiter , who approached immediately . " We 'll have mezza and kebab for two , " he said . " And bring a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon select , 1969 if you have it . " The waiter nodded and moved through the beads . " They have French wine here , " Kim said in surprise . " Not exactly . The wine served in the Old City is Carmel , grown in Rishon le Zion . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's as good as anything Barton and Guestier or Bouchard bottles . " " You seem very familiar with the country . I take it you live in Israel ? " " I do for varied periods of time , " he explained . " I 'm in the import-export business . I purchase merchandise in the Middle East and South America and sell it in Europe . " He slipped back into his alter ego effortlessly ; in many ways he was as much Hans Hoffmann as he was Ari Ben-Sion . Just then the waiter arrived carrying a round copper tray bearing the Cabernet Sauvignon and the tiny dishes comprising the mezza . As he poured the wine and spread the small portions of dips , salads , meats , sauces , and vegetables on the table before them Kim looked at Ari in amazement . " This is incredible . You 'll have to tell me what all these things are . " He took a piece of flat pita bread and dabbed it into one of the dips . " I 'll start you with tehina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He brought the piece of bread to her mouth and she took a bite , then savored the taste for a moment . " What is it ? " " Ground sesame seeds . " 39  | " I like it . " As she reached for the shakshouka , highly spiced vegetables sauteed in oil , Ari took a sip of the cool wine and looked up at her . " Are you here as a tourist ? " he asked , wondering about her last name , which obviously was n't Jewish . She shook her head . " No , I 'm in the Middle East for a combination of professional and personal reasons . I 've been commissioned by People magazine to do a photographic essay on women whose husbands were killed in the 1973 War . The assignment will take me to Cairo when I finish in Jerusalem . " She tore off a piece of the pita bread . " As for the personal reason  --  I 'm running away from a bad marriage . " Ari nodded sympathetically . He liked her candor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about ? " " Not really , " she said . " I find the more open I am about my past the more readily people I 'm with will share the details of theirs . " She scooped a tiny mound of homous onto the pita and chewed it thoughtfully . " Ted and I met in college and thought we were perfect for each other . You know , same age , same background , same upper-middle-class upbringing , et cetera . He became an architect and I went into free-lance photography . Soon after the wedding I started selling my pictures but due to the recession in the United States none of the construction firms were hiring . I had to support both of us . He grew irritable and increasingly hostile every time I made a sale . Finally he took a job in a bookstore . Then came drugs . For four years I tried to make the marriage work , but I could n't . In the end I walked out . " She drained her glass . " It hurt , particularly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I understand the feeling , " he said softly . 40  | Soon the kebab , chunks of grilled lamb marinated in finely cut onions , spices , and marjoram and arranged on hot metal plates , was set before them . " You must travel a lot in your business , " Kim said , spearing a piece of lamb with her fork . " Yes , I do . " " Traveling can become terribly lonely . I mean living out of suitcases and hotels all the time , making friends , then having to leave . Do you enjoy it ? " His mouth momentarily full , he nodded . " If you make close friends they 'll always be there regardless of how much time elapses between visits ; and if the relationships are not the same when you return that means they were n't good friends in the first place , so you 've lost nothing . " His words left him uneasy ; they were too logical , too sterile . He wondered if his recent malaise was n't the result of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the field would n't leave him empty , alone . " That 's fine when you meet people who live in places you return to , " she said , refilling her glass . " But what happens when you become close to someone there 's little likelihood you 'll see again once you move on ? " He pushed the rice pilaf around his plate . He had no answer to that . After dinner they walked through the Christian quarter toward the New Gate , one of the seven portals allowing access to the Old City . The night was cool and comfortable . Sharp stars winked in the sky . As they neared the gate he took her hand and they mounted a narrow stone stairway alongside the wall . The ramparts , replete with crenellations and towers , continuously knocked down and reconstructed over the centuries , were most recently erected by Suleiman the Magnificent during the Ottoman period . 41  | They walked side by side along the parapet until they reached a ledge projecting out of the stone . Sitting down , they gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other with almost no space between them . Their white stone roofs , domed so that the pressure from the winter snow would not collapse them , shimmered in the luminous night . In the foreground the twin cupolas and the Romanesque belfry crowning the dark , incense-filled caverns of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre protruded from the hill at Golgotha , where it 's presumed Jesus Christ was crucified . Farther away , rising from the plaza where the Temple of Solomon had stood , the golden-domed Mosque of Omar sat serenely at the center of its spacious esplanade , the smaller , silver-domed al-Aksa Mosque stationed off to the side . Looking beyond the Old City wall , past the Biblical Valley ofJehoshaphat , Ari followed the terraced graveyard covering the Mount of Olives to the wooded groves of Gethsemane . From there his eye shot upward to Mount Scopus and the buildings of the university , pale fingerlike structures silhouetted against the black sky . " You know , it 's funny , " Kim said , parting the silence . " But I 'm as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for her to explain . " My father was Protestant and my mother Jewish , so they compromised and brought me up nothing . " " Maybe you 're better off , " he said , pleased that she was legally Jewish and surprised that he cared . " I do n't think so . I would rather have been given one faith or the other . It 's important to believe in something , particularly for children . " " Do you have any preference between the two ? " " Not really . But I guess I know more about Christianity than I do about Judaism . My parents are dead , but  | when I was young , even though they agreed to ban religion from the house , sometimes my father would tell me stories about Jesus . I still remember them pretty well . " She leaned back against his shoulder . " I think one of the reasons I took this assignment was because I hoped to learn more about Judaism while I was in Israel . " " There 's no better place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing out at the brightly floodlighted spot , below the Mosque of Omar , that marked the site of the Wailing Wall . There , even now , a handful of blackcoated Jews , bobbing back and forth to the rhythmic chants of their ancient prayers , watched over the thousands of petitions to God , written on scraps of paper , and wedged into the cracks and crevices of the great stone blocks of the Wall . Surrounded by the sounds of night they talked for a long time  --  rushing into an evening the type of unburdening that usually takes weeks . Strangers adrift , they tried to compress time , to cover their backgrounds in a burst . She shared at length the story of the souring of her marriage and he spoke about a wife who 'd disintegrated into an alcoholic . She confessed to tremendous feelings of guilt and he admitted that he bore a similar burden . She talked about the important part a career plays in forming a person 's self-image and he readily agreed . Finally it grew cold and they abandoned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After sundown Jewish Jerusalem burst back to life . Lights popped on , movie marquees lit up , restaurants and bars opened their doors , and by the hundreds the city 's inhabitants swarmed into the downtown triangle formed by the intersection of King George , Ben Yehuda , and Yafo streets . The rich aroma of roasting coffee floated over the crowd as Jerusalemites wandered up and down Ben Yehuda drifting from cafe to cafe , invariably 43  | bumping into friends they greeted with noisy shouts of recognition . Kim and Ari waded through a throng of people and ducked into the stark and brilliantly lit Cafe Atara , where luckily they found an empty table on the second floor . Ordering espresso and pastry , they ate in silence , content to people-watch . Afterward he walked her to the Eden Hotel on Hillel Street . Retrieving her key from the desk clerk , they stepped into the elevator , both wondering what the other was thinking . Once inside her room she moved toward a cassette player on the dresser and snapped in a tape . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the air . " I had a lovely evening , " she said , turning to face him . He crossed the room , sensing the softness of the body outlined under her cotton blouse . Placing one hand on her waist , he brought their mouths together . Her lips , warm and pliant , roamed over his . Her fingers circled the small of his back . He breathed in the musky fragrance of her perfume . As the Morning Movement ended they moved onto the bed . 44  | ARt SAT on the stone platform of the outdoor amphitheater atop Mount Scopus separating the segments of a Jaffa orange . A few feet away Kim , the ends of the scarf tied around her neck flapping in the breeze , stood at the edge of the rear balustrade , peering out over the gorge at the Wilderness of Judah . The barren hills , broken by deep ravines winding down through the rocky slopes to the Dead Sea , were a blazing brown . The sea itself shone as the sun touched its water . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white pith from the orange . She shook her head no . He checked his watch , which read three-thirty . During the summer , in order to eat their major meal of the day and hide from the heat , most Jerusalemites went home between one and four , then returned to their jobs and worked until seven . Ari would have to leave soon if he wanted to be back at the Ministry in half an hour . But he was in no hurry to do so . He 'd been with Kim for close to three weeks ; he knew when something was on her mind , and he knew she 'd tell him when she was ready . He would wait . A few minutes later she sat down , took a segment of 45  | orange off the brown bag in front of him , and tossed it in her hand . " I have to be going soon . " " You taking more pictures this afternoon ? " " No , I 'm finished with that . " She looked at the cliffs rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't understand . I meant leaving Israel . " He peered past her toward the Arava , where the Hills of Judea broke off and the desert began . " I ca n't very well photograph Egyptian war widows from here , " she explained . " Originally I wanted to be in Cairo more than a week ago . " A sadness started to press down on him but he said nothing . She leaned over and kissed his cheek . " When ? " he asked . " I do n't know . I want to stretch it out as long as possible . Maybe another ten days . " She tossed the piece of orange back on the bag , brought her hands to his shoulders and kneaded his flesh . " Let 's not discuss it now . I had a long morning in Jericho ; I 'm too tired to talk . Besides , you said you had a meeting at the Trade Ministry at four  --  you do n't want to be late . " He nodded and began picking up the scraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked . For the first time since she started speaking he smiled . " Of course , I 'll meet you at the hotel at seven-thirty . " He rose , took her hand , and helped her up . They walked back through the rows of vacant seats in silence . Ari sat at his desk not even pretending to work ; the depression he fought consciously now , deepening . A side of him long dead had burst alive in the past three weeks . He could not , would not , let her go . Though he 46  | knew quite well that a relationship with a woman was not enough to sustain him , he 'd realized recently that its absence was part of what was wrong with his life . Somehow he 'd figure out a way to stay with her . It had to be possible . But an entire afternoon 's agitated thought brought no solution to his dilemma . A little before seven Ari , staring blankly into the corridor , heard the sound of approaching footsteps . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second their eyes met . The Colonel 's forward momentum carried him past the door but he turned back and entered the cubicle where Ari worked . The bare-walled , windowless office contained a formica desk and a gray steel filing cabinet . There was no room for an additional chair , but at least Ari had the privacy he 'd requested . " How are you doing ? " the Colonel asked . " I hate what I 'm doing , " Ari said , taking a paper clip off his desk and reshaping the wire into a line . " I 'm bored , restless , and anxious to get out of here . " The Colonel nodded . " I understand , but do be patient . We 'll have something for you eventually . " He took a Dunhill Montecruz from his inside coat pocket and screwed the cap off the aluminum tube . " Actually I 've got something now , but I do n't think it 's quite your type of assignment . " " What is it ? " The Colonel lit his cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several days ago I received a message from the Chief Rabbi and the Headmaster of the Alliance Israelite Universelle school in Damascus . They 're worried about the safety of their families . An American news program called Sixty Minutes ' recently broadcast a second report showing that Jews in Syria are not suffering under the Baath regime . As a result the Syrian government , feeling 47  | free now to do what it wants , has begun cracking down on the leaders of the Jewish community , blaming them for the initial bad publicity . The Chief Rabbi and the Headmaster of the Alliance school have asked us to take their children out of the ghetto so they ca n't be used against them . " The Colonel chewed on the end of his cigar , drawing the hot smoke into his mouth . " But an assignment to cope with the repercussions of an American television program is n't important enough for you . I 'm going to send Shaul Barkai and another junior officer . " He glanced at his watch and yawned . " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a pile of paperwork to wade through before I can get out of here . " He moved toward the door , then turned back . " Do n't be too concerned , Ari  --  eventually something appropriate for you will come up . It 's just a matter of time . " As he left Ari began doodling on the corner of a classified report . While the Colonel was talking it had struck him that he could volunteer for the mission . But this assignment was n't at all what he was accustomed to  --  this Operation Breastfeed , this Operation Nursemaid . His field was military intelligence . He 'd spent his life concerned with matters critical to the survival of Israel . How could he volunteer for .. . He lit a cigarette and thought about Cyprus . He should n't have been away from his receiver . The Colonel had been angry . Maybe . . . by going to Syria , by saving the lives of a handful of children he could atone for his carelessness . More than even the score . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Ari , this kind of sentimental crap is exactly the stuff the characters say in those lousy plays at the Habima Theater in Tel Aviv . Besides , the Colonel 's right . This assignment is n't important enough . " Abruptly he ground out his cigarette and headed for 48  | the hallway . Any field work was a hell of a lot better than what he was doing at the moment . The Colonel had just finished a cup of coffee and was about to go over the most recent transmission from the Gideon network in Egypt when he heard a sharp knock on his door . " Come in , " he said , looking up in surprise as Ari entered . " Did I forget something in your office ? " he asked . " No . " Ari noticed that there was a new Matisse reproduction hanging on the wall behind the Colonel 's desk . " I was just thinking about what you said . " " Yes . " The seams and wrinkles around his eyes tightened , demanding further explanation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd like to do it . " The Colonel closed the file in front of him and pushed it to the side . " Ari , this is not the type of mission I 'm inclined to send you on . First of all , to be quite honest , it 's not exactly top drawer and second and more importantly , I 'm looking for an agent who can pass as an Arab . That 's why I want Shaul Barkai . " " But you said you needed two agents . What about Hans Hoffmann ? " The Colonel rubbed the back of his neck . " I really do n't think it 's a good idea . " " Why not ? As a wealthy businessman anxious to purchase large quantities of furniture and textiles he would be able to move freely inside Syria . " A long silence followed . Slowly the Colonel got up and walked around the room , searching for an ashtray . He found one , put it by his chair , then ignored it . His thoughts were elsewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked finally . Pacing behind his desk , the Colonel began mumbling out loud . " Hans Hoffmann could gain access to the Ger-49  | man colony in Damascus . And from there , yes , if he had a good cover story . . . possibly as an ex-SS officer .. . and you do know Dachau well . " He stopped and looked directly at Ari . " It could work . But are you sure you . . . " " I 'm sure , " Ari said forcefully , drowning out the rest of his sentence . " It just might be a good idea at that . " The Colonel settled back into his soft chair . " All right , I 'll send you to Syria . Pack a suitcase and take the bus down to Kibbutz Revivim the day after tomorrow . Report to Yosef Tsur . I 'll tell him to be expecting you . " Ari nodded . " Okay , that 's all . Now leave me alone so I can work out the details . " Buoyed by a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been to Revivim but he knew about the kibbutz , located thirty-five miles southwest of Beersheva . There on a desolate stretch of the Negev desert , behind the hills outside the settlement , the Mossad had constructed a walk-through scale model of Damascus . Throughout the evening Kim suspected that something had happened that afternoon ; after they made love she was sure of it . It was as if a heavy weight had been knocked off his shoulders and he could charge into every activity with renewed relish . Kim wondered how long the change would last . Several times she asked if anything special had occurred that day . Each time he brushed aside her queries with a kiss and a terse no . She knew better than to press him ; like most successful women she 'd learned that was not the way to get what she wanted . As they lay entwined in the soft afterglow of sex she ran her fingers from his buttocks up his spine to the nape of his neck then back again . After a few minutes he took 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , and brushed the knuckles with a kiss . " I want to ask you something , " he said , turning to face her . She looked at him , her blue-gray eyes bright in the darkness . " I just had an idea . The way things have worked out I find I 'm going to be flying to Damascus to purchase a rather large quantity of Arab textiles and furniture . I may be there for several weeks or longer . I do n't know yet . The point is , you could do the other half of your photographic essay from Syria instead of Egypt . It should n't make much difference which of Israel 's major adversaries you cover . " A note of expectancy edged his voice . " We could meet in Damascus . " Silence filled the room . " Kim ... " No response . " Do you want to ? " " I do n't know , " she said , restlessly shifting position under the covers . " What about my plans ? " " It seems silly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Could n't you buy similar merchandise in Egypt ? " " No . " She propped a pillow against the headboard and leaned back against it . As he moved near , touching his mouth to her thigh , she outlined his nose with her forefinger . " I do want to stay with you . I guess I could cable my editor . I do n't think he 'd mind if I ... " He pulled her down to him and covered the rest of her sentence with his lips . She snuggled against his chest . Her skin felt warm where it met his . Her scent was familiar , comforting . Gradually they came together trying to freeze the 51  | sweep of time , to hold onto the moment , to keep it from receding into the past . Breathing audibly , they rocked back and forth ; Ari surging into a rolling climax , followed seconds later by Kim . Afterward they both drifted asleep . Ari arrived at Kibbutz Revivim Tuesday afternoon , at the peak of the sun 's arc across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quadrant of the sky , sucked all moisture from the air . The kibbutz , set in the midst of rolling hills of rock and arid earth , survived on water piped down from the north . Walking along a row of white stucco cottages surrounded by patches of grass and leafy palms , he asked directions to the communal dining room and was taken there by a brown-skinned girl wearing shorts and sandals . Yosef Tsur , a slight , thinfaced man with a pencil moustache , was waiting for him inside . After lunch , Tsur , a Syrian Jew who had escaped from Damascus in 1961 , took Ari to his cottage , a one-room house on the fringes of the kibbutz with a window facing the desert . The walls of the cottage , bare now , would soon be covered with aerial photographs of Damascus . Ari was told to rest . Avraham Mendelssohn , an expert in the history and internal workings of the Waffen SS , would be in to see him at five . For the next eight days Ari 's time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape the summer sun , which was unbearable by eleven ; each morning Tsur drove him by jeep to the mile-long scale model where a host of Israeli agents had first familiarized themselves with the Syrian capital . Over and over again Tsur walked him through the streets of Damascus , spending a large chunk of time in the southeast sector of the inner city  --  the Haret al Yahoud , the guarded ghetto 52  | where Damascus 's three thousand Jews were imprisoned . In the evenings and nights , Mendelssohn drilled Ari on everything he needed to know to pass as an SS officer . He reviewed the titles , modes of address , collar insignias and the types of uniforms worn at various occasions , quickly  --  for they were already etched on Ari 's mind . He remembered them from Dachau . Next Mendelssohn rushed him through the ideological course he would have received had he been trained at the SS police school near Rabka in the Carpathian Mountains . Then came the marching songs , drinking songs , and various unit songs . In the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former German Jews into SS officers , but the Colonel had ordered him to take only eight days this time . Ari was expected to move socially among the Nazis , not penetrate their organization . Consequently , he need not be letter perfect . Though Mendelssohn thought his instructions a bit unusual , he did n't question them . The following Wednesday Ari took the bus back to Jerusalem , where the Colonel outlined the steps he and Lieutenant Barkai were to take to bring Chief Rabbi Sassoon 's and Headmaster Kimche 's seven children safely to Israel . For security reasons , from this point on , the mission was to be referred to only as Operation Goshen : the Biblical name of the land the Hebrew slaves inhabited before Moses led them out of Egypt . When the particulars of the briefing had been laid out and all questions answered the Colonel stacked the papers scattered in front of him and turned to Ari . " Now , if and only if something of a desperate urgency arises you can contact our permanently placed agent in Syria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel . " There 've 53  | always been rumors . For years I 've heard we 've had somebody high up in the Baath Party but it 's never been confirmed . How did ... " " Do n't ask any questions , " the Colonel said , cutting him off . " Operative Sixty-six is a member of the Syrian Parliament . He was a sleeper agent for twelve years . You need n't know more than that . As the last of the last resorts here 's how you reach him ... " After he 'd gone over the procedure for contacting Operative 66 Ari rose to leave . But the Colonel halted him with a sweep of his hand . " Just one more thing . While you 're with the Nazis , if you could find out how much they know about Dov Elon and how much he 's told his interrogators it would be most helpful . " Ari nodded and continued toward the door , aware from a lifelong association with the Colonel that his casual , last-minute orders were invariably crucial  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment . He took the Mossad chief 's request and filed it in the back of his mind . The Colonel 's offhand tone betrayed the importance of his words ; Ari would not forget either . After spending a final night with Kim and arranging to meet her at the New Ommayad Hotel in Damascus , he flew to Frankfurt . 54  | Guy LAVALLE sat in his room in the Ledra Palace Hotel staring out the window . Across Marcos Drakos Avenue stood the ancient Venetian wall which still surrounded the old city of Nicosia . At the base of the wall , near United Nations Square , someone had painted the word ENOSIS  --  the name of the nationalist movement , active intermittently since 1878 , that favored the union of Cyprus with Greece . Beyond the arrow-shaped battlements that topped the enormous ramparts Lavalle could see the twin minarets spiraling above the skyline from the Turkish section of the old city . They belonged to St. Sophia 's , once a magnificent crusader cathedral , now the equally splendid Selimiye Mosque . Moving across the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If all went well he would be back on the Continent in the morning . The phone rang for a long time . Just as he was about to hang up someone answered . " Hello . " The female voice sounded half asleep . " Michelle Giroux ? " " Yes . " " I think I have some information you might be interested in. " 55  | " Who is this ? " she asked suspiciously , pushing away the covers . " My name is of little importance . I could give you any one of a dozen , but you may call me Guy if you like . " Michelle sat on the edge of the bed and ran her fingers against her hair . It was nine A.M. She was not her best until after lunch . " What kind of information ? " " It 's about a mutual friend , or should I say adversary . " Michelle lit a cigarette and inhaled slowly . " What are you selling and how much do you want ? " Lavalle laughed into the receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What are you selling ? " she repeated coldly . Like most agents Michelle approached the informer with contempt , particularly when he possessed quality information ; for the better the information the greater the fear that lurking among one 's own colleagues was a malcontent , anxious to buttress his deflated ego by selling you out . " Do you know a Hans Hoffmann ? " Lavalle asked , slowly reeling out the bait . " If I did n't , there would n't be much point to this call , would there ? " Michelle decided to play his game ; she was excited . Hans Hoffmann had been her biggest assignment before he 'd gone back to Europe and disappeared . It had taken her months of standing in line at the Ottoman Bank before she 'd been able to lure him into initiating a conversation . Her superiors would reward her appreciably for additional information about the Israeli . " Then you 're interested ? " " That depends on the extent of your information and the price . " Michelle ground out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you be interested in knowing where he is right now ? " " How much ? " " Five thousand French francs . " " How will I know you 're telling the truth ? " Lavalle tugged at his short , dark beard . " You wo n't . " " Where can we meet ? " Michelle asked . " Have the money this afternoon . I 'll be outside Salim 's Oriental Bazaar in the Turkish quarter at two o'clock . " " How will I recognize you ? " " I 'll recognize you . " He hung up . Satisfied with the arrangements , Lavalle went downstairs and had a leisurely breakfast . He watched her from the shop across Asmalti Street , just off Ataturk Square . She wore a white blouse and a brown plaid skirt . Her black hair was pulled back and tied with a ribbon , exposing a quite lovely face . She was petite , yet perfectly proportioned . Lavalle suspected that more than a few men fell for her . Michelle seemed comfortable in the bazaar , arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with experienced intractability . After a few minutes she placed the stone on the counter with affected disinterest and started to leave . The merchant swore to himself , muttered an oath in praise of Allah , and gave in to her price , making her promise not to tell anyone how little she paid for the turquoise gem . Michelle slipped the ring on her finger , remembering he 'd said the same thing to her the last time she had made a purchase there . Lavalle waited until ten after two before crossing the street . Michelle was looking at some long embroidered dresses hanging in the open air when he drew near . 57  | " That one 's very nice , " he said , as she fingered a black dress with gold stitching . Michelle turned to find a tall , lean man with dark hair and a short beard looking over her shoulder . He was about thirty , younger than she had expected . " Shall we walk ? " he suggested . She nodded . They headed deeper into the bazaar , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , past clothing stores and innumerable merchants who bid them enter just to look : " No charge for looking . " Finally they stopped across from a candy factory , heavy with the aroma of sticky honey . " Who are you ? " she asked , speaking first . He smiled . " A friend . " " That 's not enough , my superiors will want to know more . " Then tell them we have something in common , a mutual dislike for Hoffmann and the rest of the Zionist swine . " " They will want to know who you represent . " Lavalle turned abruptly . " Do you want to ask questions or do you want the information ? " " The money is in my purse . Now where is Hans Hoffmann and what is he doing ? " Ignoring her , he began to walk along Beuyum Hamam Street toward the Saray Onou Mosque , noticing that due to recent hostilities on the island the bazaar was almost devoid of tourists . She hurried to catch up , rushing past a bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-two kilometers , depending if one is a Turkish or Greek Cypriot . Greek buses are not allowed to pass through the Turkish sectors of Cyprus ; consequently , the distances they must travel are greatly increased . But the sign was an old one . In 1974 invading forces from Turkey seized a third of the island , occupying everything north of a line running from Famagusta through Nicosia 58  | to Kokina . Greek buses no longer travel to Kyrenia . Lavalle soon stopped , but this time he looked at her without speaking . Understanding the message his eyes conveyed , she withdrew an envelope from her purse and handed it to him . Without bothering to check the sum , he slipped the money into his coat pocket . " Tomorrow Hans Hoffmann will fly from Frankfurt to Damascus . What he is doing there should not be very hard for the Syrian Second Bureau to determine for itself . " With that he turned and hurried away . 59  | FIFTEEN THOUSAND feet up and descending , the wings of the Lufthansa 707 seemed to shiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ari looked out the window at the desolate Syrian plain , broken by thorny shrubs and I thistles . Although Damascus is less than fifty miles from the sea , the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountain ranges cut off the moisture-laden winds and allow only a few inches of rain to fall on the Syrian capital each year . Below him the Barada River , winding down from the mountain grottoes east of Beirut , cut a channel through the barren soil . Entering Damascus , the river separated into six main arteries and fanned out into al-Ghutah , an oasis of more than a hundred square miles . Beyond III stretched al-Sahra , the desert ; then five hundred miles away , Bagdad , where the Barada dies . For centuries Damascus maintained contact with the outside world solely by means of camel-driven caravans which plodded across the sands . She is the oldest continuously inhabited city on earth ; her sisters , Nineveh and Babylon , expired long ago . As the airliner began its final approach into the wind Ari fastened his seatbelt and looked down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | minarets , mosques , mausoleums , and generally colorless skyline . The plane banged down on the tarmac , bounced , then slid into the desert runway . Ari felt his breast pocket ; his passport , the letters , cards , and documentary paraphernalia of a German national were all there . The Israeli Secret Service was meticulous , especially with the most minor details . His clothes , down to his underwear and socks , were of European manufacture , and his suits reflected the style and quality fitting a German commercial traveler in the import-export business . In the false bottom of his toiletry case the Mossad had installed a miniature transmitter ; a long-range antenna , wired into the cord of his electric shaver , would allow him to communicate directly with Jerusalem . As the passengers began to disembark Ari rose and stretched . The last ten days would have been hell if they had not served to inject meaning into a life devoid of purpose . He reveled in the night-long briefings , in memorizing the twists and turns of Damascus 's underground sewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city with Tsur . He knew every building in the Haret al Yahoud , the Jewish quarter , as well as the names and backgrounds of scores of its inhabitants . Getting into the haret without arousing suspicion posed a problem  --  but one the Mossad had anticipated and solved . The Colonel had activated Hans Hoffmann for one more mission , but Ari was determined not to make it his last . As he came down the steep steps from the plane the hot wind kicked the sand up from the runway and sent it sailing toward the terminal . Ari reached the ground and hurried past the olive-uniformed corporal who held a Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle at his side , right fore-61  | finger wrapped around the trigger . Parked along the edge of the field were five MIG-21s . Beyond them Ari caught the glint of Russian RPG-7 missile launchers . Damascus International Airport was used by both civil airlines and the Syrian Air Force . Ari cleared customs without delay , the Syrian Embassy in Bonn having stamped his worn passport with a threemonth visa . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import large quantities of Damascene furniture and textiles , he had insisted on seeing Ari personally , and providing him with letters to smooth his entry . The ambassador assured him that he would have no trouble communicating in French . Assigned the mandate over Syria at San Remo in 1920 , France retained control over the area until May , 1945 , when after a final armed clash and the threat of British intervention , the Gaullists withdrew and the Arabs proclaimed an independent state . But French influence remained strong , pervading the organization of Syria 's institutions as well as providing the country with an official second language . Making his way into the crowded arrival lounge , Ari allowed an Arab boy to pile his bags on a cart , watching as he placed the vital toiletry case on top of his other two suitcases . " Get me a taxi , " he said . The ragged youngster nodded and pushed the cart ahead of Ari , whistling merrily , apparently in his mind already spending the generous tip this wealthy businessman would surely give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door swung closed behind him and in front of Ari , he abruptly grabbed the small toiletry case and ran . Ari bolted out the door and chased him down the sidewalk , brushing past businessmen in styleless suits and tarbooshed sheiks . But the years had taken their toll 62  | on Ben-Sion . Despite the extra weight of the case the boy gained easily and Ari , frustrated and panting , was forced to stop . In disbelief he watched him disappear into a group of blue-coveralled workers . Breathing heavily , Ari turned back , hoping the boy would be satisfied with the shaving cream and the variety of soaps and scents and not search further and find the transmitter . Even if he did it would be unlikely he 'd take it to the police and admit to having stolen the case from an arriving passenger . Sweat rolling from his forehead and armpits , Ari slowly made his way toward the baggage carrier , cursing under his breath , for by chance the boy had chosen his most important piece of luggage . Contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Moving past rows of sandbags piled against the concrete terminal , Ari headed toward the taxi drivers calling for customers with a loud Shaam . . . yallah as-Shaam ! Immediately four surrounded him , shouting in Arabic and French , arguing among themselves , each swearing he 'd seen the tourist first . Ari pointed to a moustached man whose black and white checkered keffiyeh fell over his shoulders , and he grabbed the suitcases off the cart . Following the Arab to his taxi , Ari wiped his forehead with his sleeve , then stepped into the cab . Resting his arm on the ledge of the window , he quickly jerked it up . The metal was too hot ; the heat burned through his shirt . As the taxi driver screeched away from the curb Ari closed his eyes . The smell of gasoline clung to his nostrils . Passing rows of yellow stone houses with red tile roofs , they approached the city from the south , via Khalid ibn Walid Street . At the intersection of El Nasr Boulevard the traffic stalled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on bicycles with nargilehs strapped to their backs wove in between the horn-blow-63  | ing Fiats , Peugeots , Czech Skodas , and early-model Chevrolets . Drivers leaned out their windows and shouted curses up ahead . On the sidewalks peasant women in full-length festan , their foreheads circled in , gold coins , countrymen in dark blue cheroual pantaloons , Yizidis in loose-fitting trousers with brocade sashes , and businessmen in dark suits all went about their business , oblivious to the pandemonium in the street . To the left , through the square in front of the Hejaz Railroad Station , Ari saw the two pencil minarets and the domed prayer room of the Suleiman Tekkiyeh , a convent for the Whirling Dervishes , built by Suleiman the Magnificent in 1554 . As he leaned forward to take a better look the back of his shirt , wet , clung to the vinyl seat . Returning his head to the upholstery , he waited for the honking to die down and the taxi to start up again . It was cooler when 1 1 , the car moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brazil and Maysaloun streets on a little hill overlooking the Barada River . Ari paid the driver , who anxiously accepted his deutschemarks , and walked up the stone steps to the hotel . Inside he handed the clerk his passport and reservation voucher and in turn received a fiche de police , a questionnaire required of all foreigners . A red-coated and - capped bellboy brought his luggage to the fifth-floor suite . The rooms , a large bedroom and a smaller adjoining one , were white plaster with matching blue patterned rugs and draperies . The bellboy flipped a switch on the wall and the black blades of the overhead fan sliced slowly through the air . Ari gave him a handful of the piasters he 'd received downstairs in exchange for his hard currency and ushered the boy out the door . After unpacking he took a long , cold shower . Then he phoned 1,1111 64  | the Government Trade Bureau and spoke to the director , Amin al-Husseini , who 'd received a cable from the Syrian Embassy in Bonn and had been expecting his call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to welcome him in his office in half an hour if that was convenient . Ari thanked him and hung up . Gathering his papers together , he went downstairs and decided to walk the short distance along the river to the central government offices located off Marjeh Square . When he reached the street he was already sweaty . Standing inside the square that connected the decaying Surujiye Suq with the modern , bustling center of town , Ari stared up at the monument commemorating the completion of the Hejaz telegraph line to Mecca . The fifty-foot , soot-covered obelisk , erected in 1911 , was surrounded by a large area of grass , burnished brown by the long summer . At its base , Ari watched a juice seller crush a mound of carrots under a vise , working the lever back and forth until the liquid dribbled into the glass . The fronts of office buildings  --  five , six stories high , with neon signs protruding from their roofs  --  faced the square on all four sides . Their once creamy white facades were darkened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these windows , Ari remembered angrily , that inflamed Damascenes threw refuse at the dangling body of Eli Cohen , the Israeli spy hung publicly on May 18 , 1965 . More than ten thousand Syrians had crowded into Marjeh Square , pushing and shoving in order to secure the best possible view . Ari dipped his head in deference to the memory of his colleague , then moved toward the Trade Ministry , uneasy as he pictured himself suspended from the same gallows . " Salam alekum , " greeted al-Husseini as Ari was led 65 t " Salam ale um , ' 0 greeted al-Husseini as Ari was led  | into his office . " It is my great pleasure to welcome you to Damascus , " he continued in French , the language they had spoken on the phone . " Please have a seat . " He pointed to a wooden chair across from his desk . Al-Husseini , though of average height , was slight of frame . His face was thin and would have been considered plain if not for his eyes ; they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a French tailored business suit without a tie . Ari settled into the chair offered him and looked around the room . Al-Husseini 's office was sparsely furnished . Cheap , assembly-line-produced tapestries hugged the walls . A series of cracks spread across the ceiling . " Your accommodations are satisfactory ? If not I could ... " " That will be unnecessary . I have a very comfortable suite . " " Good . " Al-Husseini smiled . " Let me ring for some light refreshment . " He spoke into the phone in rapid Arabic . " I think you mentioned a letter when we spoke earlier , " he said , returning the receiver to its place . Ari reached into his breast pocket and produced the letter the ambassador had given him in Bonn . " You will be here for some time ? " the Trade Bureau director asked , unfolding the letter and slipping on a pair of reading glasses . " At least several weeks , possibly longer . " Al-Husseini scanned the page rapidly . " This is very impressive . So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and furniture in Europe ? " " That depends on the price . Inflation is spiraling in the capitalist world , with it inevitably comes a jump in the cost of labor . If I buy quality goods here inexpensively , I can sell them all over the Continent at prices European 66  | manufacturers wo n't be able to compete with . We should be able to operate at a substantial profit both for me and for your Syrian merchants . " " I can show you whatever is of interest , " he said , removing his glasses . " If you wish I will have a man with a car at your disposal in the morning . " There was a knock at the door and a young boy entered carrying a silver tray . He placed it on the desk in front of al-Husseini and left hurriedly . On the tray k was a flowered pot and a pile of little porcelain cups without handles , stacked one inside the other . The Trade Bureau director filled one with coffee and passed it to Ari . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's medium sweet , flavored with cardamon seeds . It pleases most tastes . " Ari held the hot cup with the tips of his fingers . As he sipped the coffee the ginger aroma of the cardamon drifted up from the surface of the liquid . " I like it , " he said . Al-Husseini smiled . " Good , we are off to a pleasant start . Now , tell me , what would you like to see first ? " Ari set the coffee on the edge of the desk . " At the moment I 'm most interested in hand-carved backgammon sets ; recently the game has become an international craze . " Al-Husseini laughed . " In this part of the world we have been playing shesh-besh , what you call backgammon , for nearly three thousand years . Damascus 's olive wood sets are the most delicately crafted in existence . You shall see some tomorrow as well as brocade woven from the finest silks . My personal assistant , Mustafa Suidani , will accompany you both to the shops and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your hotel whenever it is convenient for you . " 67  | " I 'd like to start early . Could he pick me up at 8:00 A.M. ? " Ari asked , wanting to leave the impression that he was a serious businessman . " If that is the hour you wish , he will be there . I think it best we leave any discussion of quantities and money until after you 've had the opportunity to examine our merchandise for yourself . But as the average per capita income for all Syrians is less than ten dollars per week I think you 'll find our prices quite reasonable . " Al-Husseini glanced at his watch and grimaced . " I must apologize for the abruptness of this meeting , " he said , rising . " But there are pressing matters I must attend to now . However , if you have no other plans for this evening , I 'd like to invite you to dine with me . " Ari stood . " Thank you , I would be delighted to do so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Ommayad Hotel . . . say at seven o'clock . " " Your hospitality is most gracious . Seven o'clock will be fine . " He turned and moved toward the door . " If there is anything else I might do to make your stay more pleasant , please do not refrain from asking . " Ari stopped and looked back at him . " Possibly there is one thing . " " Yes . " " Arabs and people of my background have shared an important concern ever since the Zionists moved into the Middle East . It is known that there are Germans of the old order living in Damascus . It can grow quite lonely in a foreign land without the company of one 's countrymen . If you could arrange something , it would be quite enjoyable to spend an evening with those with whom one has something in common . " " I understand fully , " al-Husseini said . " I 'll see what I can do . " Ari thanked the Trade Bureau director and left . 68  | Outside , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his immediate surroundings could prove crucial . Proceeding down Sa'ad Zaghloul Street , across from the Palace of Justice , he passed into Old Damascus without being aware of it . The houses were piled so thick against and on top of one another , they were indistinguishable from the walls surrounding the inner city . The narrow street , flanked by open shops overhung with clothes , twisted and curved , leading finally into the Suq Hamidieh , the broad , high , central marketplace . Overhead , the sun beat against the arched corrugated iron roof , slanting through stone and bullet holes , sending streams of light against the windows of the shops . Ari wove his way through crowds of bearded Druze , deeply tanned Bedouin , village women wearing long embroidered dresses , and dark-eyed , miniskirted Damascene girls . Hamidieh Street , criss-crossed by alleys , was lined with fruit and vegetable sellers sitting on stools next to stands piled high with tomatoes , sticky raisins , cabbage , eggplant , and sabbara pears . One old man , his keffiyeh flowing down his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of which a number of broken red samples were haphazardly exhibited . Ari studied the area carefully . Kibbutz Revivim 's scale model had provided him with an accurate layout of the city 's streets and alleys ; but the positions of the people and stalls , the best avenues for quick maneuver , could be determined only in person . Farther on , flies buzzed around chunks of raw meat hanging from iron hooks inside a series of butcher shops . Ragged beggars sitting on the ground stretched out their hands pleading for baksheesh . Boys from unseen restaurants carried trays laden with soup and stuffed peppers to customers in the lanes . Children , barefoot and dirty , played in the water that trickled along  | the edge of the sidewalk . Peddlers ' cries reverberated off the high vaulted roof , punctuated by the rat-a-tat-tat of the three-wheeled motorized carts that moved goods from shop to shop through the masses of pedestrians . Along the facades of the buildings electric lights blazed , as only patches of sunlight managed to pierce through the frayed awning overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ari hurried forward , breathing through his mouth . Two hundred yards into the suq he reached the nargileh shops , displaying a seemingly infinite size and variety of waterpipes on carpets spread across the sidewalk . In the dark shoe-sellers ' bazaar walls of footwear descended from frames on all sides , the smell of leather hanging heavily in the air . In the darkness the wooden sandals , Moroccan slippers , and bobbled tartan boots all glittered with cut-glass ornamentation . Ottoman daggers , vases etched with birds of paradise , and cheap opaline ware from China lined the shelves of the antique shops . Peddlers thrust garments at Ari and tried to press wooden boxes inlaid with camel-bone and mother-ofpearl into his hands . But it was not until he reached the silk bazaar that he stopped . Inside Tony Stephen 's shop the bright-eyed ChristianArab merchant let rolls of colorful damask tumble over the counters . Ari fingered the lustrous fabric , breaking off a thread and putting a match to it . Instead of burning , like polyesters , rayons , and other synthetic fibers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his customer knew the test for pure silk . Just then the high-pitched , plaintive call of the muezzin , beckoning believers to the third of the day 's five appointed times of prayer , rose above the din outside . First came the long , drawn-out musical wail Allah akbar from the Great Ommayad Mosque , and the muffled an-70  | swer Ashhad an la ilah ills llah from the at-Tawba . Then in rapid succession voices chimed in from all over the city , rising in splinters of sad refrain , falling tremulously away . On the sidewalk some people spread out prayer rugs where they were , knelt to the ground , and faced Mecca ? most unaware that in the first years of Islam , hoping to draw Jews to the riew religion , Muhammad had prayed toward Jerusalem . Others , Ari among them , hurried over the short distance to where the marketplace opened into the courtyard of the Ommayad Mosque . Inside the 145-yard-long prayer hall a thousand bodies knelt in unison , foreheads touching the carpets . The imam of the mosque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof and cried , " Allah akbar ! " and the congregation repeated after him , " God is great ! " Ari peered in through the ornately inlaid porticos , then looked up and followed the flight of chirping sparrows , who darted among the eaves and Roman capitals , around Byzantine cupolas and the mausoleum that reputedly holds the severed head of John the Baptist . Above the courtyard , with its variegated marble panels and double arcade of columns , glittered twenty thousand square feet of mosaic , the finest in Islam . Suddenly , listening to the singsong chant echoing off the walls of the long prayer hall , sweat broke out on Ari 's brow . Instantly he knew why . The fear was back . The terrible fear of discovery , the all-pervasive awareness that the slightest mistake , the most minute miscalculation , would bring the secret police crashing down on him . Pain would follow , excruciating pain , and then if he was lucky , a quick death . But spies , Ari knew from experience , rarely bumped into luck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its wake an emptiness that clung to him . Slowly he left the 71  | mosque and headed for the Bab al-Farraj Gate , where he could hail a shared sheirut taxi , distinguishable from private cabs by their special red and white number plates . At seven o'clock al-Husseini had picked Ari up at the New Ommayad and driven to the Caves du Roi Club , where they sat waiting for a third party , someone al-Husseini wanted him to meet . The restaurant was designed to approximate the atmosphere of an underground cavern . The walls and floor were of rough stone . A sheet of red cloth covered the ceiling and the same colored shades circled the dimmed hanging lamps . The tables and chairs were of unadorned wood . Soft music rippled through the background . " There he is now , " al-Husseini said , setting down his glass of arak and pointing to a tall , elderly man who despite his age moved hurriedly in their direction . He had fair skin and gray hair . The Trade Bureau director slipped off his seat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to introduce Sabri ibn Mahmud . " Ibn Mahmud bowed slightly and extended his right hand . " My pleasure , " he said in French , though everything about him was German , from his appearance down to his manners and the abruptness of his body movement . As they moved to a table in the far corner of the small room Ari turned to Ibn Mahmud . " You are German ? " he asked in that language . " That depends on who is asking . " " Herr Hoffmann can be trusted , " al-Husseini interjected . " He is a friend of the Syrian ambassador in Bonn . He carries a personal letter of introduction . " Ibn Mahmud nodded . " My real name is Franz Ludin. 72  | I was formerly first officer in the Propaganda Ministry of Dr. Josef Goebbels . " A smile spread over Ari 's face . " This is indeed a great honor . So few of Germany 's true sons are still alive . We meet all too rarely these days . Herr Ludin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toast . " Ari lifted his glass and raised it toward the ceiling . " To those that died and to those forced to scatter over the globe , seig heil . " " Seig heil , " Ludin exclaimed , emptying his glass . Then pouring another round of arak , he looked over at Ari . " You were a member of the National Socialistische Ar-beiterpartei ? " " Waffen SS , " he said proudly . Ludin added water to his arak and the clear grape alcohol turned a milky opaque . " Where were you trained ? " " At the police school in the woods near Rabka . That 's in the Carpathian mountains not far from ... " " The Polish ski resort of Zakopane , " Ludin finished his sentence for him . " I knew the school well , it was run by SS Oberscharfiihrer Oskar Walke . " " I 'm afraid you are mistaken , Herr Ludin . The school commandant was SS Obersturmfiihrer Wilhelm Hofle of I lamburg . " Ludin smiled and took another sip from his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trick you , but the Jews are everywhere , one can not be too careful . " " One can never be careful enough , " Ari agreed . " Where were you stationed during the war ? " " Dachau concentration camp , " Ari said , looking down at his plate . " I was only a minor functionary , an Untersturmfiihrer in charge of organizing the productive work of the prisoners in the labor kommando . No war crime charges were filed against me . " Ludin stared across the table at the man more than a 73  | dozen years his junior . " You seem almost embarrassed that no one is hunting you . " Ari nodded weakly . " Somehow I feel I could not have served the Fiihrer to the utmost if . . . " " Do n't be naive , Untersturmfiihrer Hoffmann . You had your task to perform , others had theirs . By chance you were not chosen to assist directly in the exterminali tion of the Jews . If you had been you would have complied without hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do you think Allied bombers leveled Munich , but left Dachau , a mere eleven miles to the northwest , untouched ? Because the Americans knew if they rescued the Jews , they would have had to absorb them in their borders , and they wanted them as little as we did . " " Herr Ludin donates his services as an expert on the Jewish Question to the Syrian Ministry of Orientation , " al-Husseini said . " There are Jews in Syria ? " Ari asked , acting puzzled . " A mere four and a half thousand , " al-Husseini explained . " Dealing with them is like asking the designer of the Aswan Dam to teach a child how to block the water draining down the side of a street , " Ludin said . Ari nodded understandingly . VIII As al-Husseini had taken it upon himself to order for his guests , soon steaming plates of Kharouf Mechout , stuffed roast lamb , were brought to the table . With their meal the waiter suggested a bottle of Domaine de Tourelle , a popular Lebanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the wine . The three men ate with relish . The minutes fell away as they alternated arguing Middle East politics with telling war stories . Ari played his role with the polish of the professional . He wanted to appear ingenuous , a bit 74  | naive . He felt he could win over the aging Nazi by playing on his vanity , on their common past . Ludin could be of invaluable service if manipulated skillfully from the outset . As baklava and coffee were served Ari yawned . " Pardon me , " he said , looking at his watch . " It 's later than I realized . I 've had a long day . " Though genuinely tired , he was anxious to return to the hotel for a quite different reason . Al-Husseini lifted his cup to his lips and drained the contents . " Do n't hurry yourself on my account , " Ari said . " I do n't mind taking a taxi . " " In that case please feel no obligation to stay , " alHusseini said , lowering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us have some business to discuss that I 'm sure would only bore you . " " Then I think I shall avail myself of some muchneeded sleep . It was indeed a pleasure meeting you , Herr Ludin , " Ari said , rising . " As I know virtually no one in Damascus I hope I can take the liberty of calling on you at your convenience . " " No need to be so formal , my friend . First of all , you must call me Franz . Second , all government offices are shut on Friday , the Moslem holy day . Why do n't we spend the afternoon and evening together and take in a few sights ? " " That 's kind of you , I 'd enjoy that very much . " " Good , then I shall pick you up at three , the day after tomorrow . " " I 'll be looking forward to it . " He shook hands with both men and left the restaurant . Back at the hotel , Ari went immediately to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim Johnson had registered two hours earlier and could be k d  | found in room 204 . Even though the second floor was only one flight up he took the elevator . Moving down the hallway , he knocked on her door , waited , then pounded harder ; but to his surprise no one answered . Wondering where she had gone at such a late hour , he wrote her a note , slipped it under the wood , and took the elevator up to his suite . Kicking off his shoes , he sat on the edge of the bed , then stretched out and tried to push the tiredness from his limbs . He 'd put the loss of the transmitter out of his mind all day , but now the impact of what had happened began to hit him . The Colonel , assuming he was too experienced an agent to misplace the toiletry case , had not arranged an alternate method of communication . If any more unexpected problems arose there would be no way to contact Jerusalem . He was cut off  --  on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian quarter of Damascus on the twelfth . Ari yawned out loud and let his thoughts drift elsewhere . A large part of him resented that he was in Damascus , resented the fact that he 'd volunteered , almost begged for assignment to a mission intended for two less experienced agents . Sure , he was n't a hundred percent as sharp as he used to be ; he began to realize that on Cyprus , but certainly he still had a number of good years left . Years that could be spent .. . Just then he heard a light tapping at his door . With a smile on his lips he moved across the room and opened it . Kim was standing in the hallway . For a long second he just looked at her . He kept forgetting the strong physical impact she had on him until they met after an absence and it struck him again . Dressed in a short skirt , her legs in cloth boots laced to the knees , her blue-gray eyes softly shaded and sparkling , she seemed more the crea-76 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd grown to know intimately . " Well , are you going to let me in ? " she asked , bringing her hands to her waist in mock anger . " I think I could be talked into it . " She entered the room and he drew her into his arms , comforted by the familiarity of her touch and the musky fragrance of her perfume . She kissed him , letting her lips linger over his , then moved toward the chair next to the dresser . " I 'm exhausted , " she said , sitting down . " I wanted to see the city . I 've been walking for . . . I do n't know .. . hours . " He sat on the bed near her and looked at the open door leading to the balcony . " Do n't you think it 's dangerous for a woman to be out alone here at night ? " " No , " she said , the edge of irritation cutting through her voice . Even before she answered he was sorry he 'd asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety ; that 's not what had prompted his supposed concern . " How was your flight ? " he asked quickly , changing the subject . " Fine . I 'm glad you convinced me to go through Greece instead of Cyprus . I really enjoyed myself in Athens . " Even if one had the foresight , as Kim had , to request her Israeli visa be stamped on a removable piece of paper , flying from Nicosia to Damascus was tantamount to advertising the traveler had begun his journey in Tel Aviv . Once in Syria all passengers arriving on flights from Cyprus were closely watched  --  a pointless policy since no one attempting anything subversive was foolish 77  | enough to enter a Moslem state from the island country so near to Israel 's coastline . Kim fingered the long strands of her champagnecolored hair , trying to draw the static electricity out of it . " Did you complete the necessary business transactions with your partners in Frankfurt ? " He nodded , hating to lie to her . She looked up at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you ask ? " It made him uneasy that she could immediately sense when something was on his mind ; then again , her ability to reach into him was a great part of what made her so attractive . " I do n't know . You seem a little tense . " " I 'm sorry . I 'm probably just tired . " He massaged the back of his neck with his hand . " It 's been a long day . " " Here , let me do that , " she said , moving onto the , bed . She worked the flesh in his shoulders and neck , kneading the tightness out of his muscles . " You 're going to put me to sleep , " he said as a liquid warmth flowed under his skin . She stopped and circled her hands around his chest . " Actually I would n't mind that . I 'm absolutely worn out . " He turned and kissed her on the forehead . " Let 's go to bed . " They undressed , slipped under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted from the world of conscious thought . 78  | AFTER MEETING Michelle , Guy Lavalle drove directly to Larnaca Airport and boarded a CypAir flight for Paris . He spent a day roaming the banks of the Seine , visiting art museums and viewing his favorite paintings . He was especially fond of Manet 's Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe and Pissarro 's The Orchard , hanging in the Jeu de Paume at the edge of the Tuileries between the Louvre and the Place de la Concorde . Both Manet 's bold plains of color and Pissarro 's splashes of light depicted the outdoors with extraordinary feeling . Lavalle appreciated their artistic innovations . Finally , certain that he was n't being followed , he met his contact and switched passports . Resuming his real identity , Lieutenant Shaul Barkai , member of the Mossad since 1968 , youngest agent ever to be awarded the Ot Haoz medal , a man on his way to a very promising career in Israeli intelligence , flew back to Tel Aviv . The Colonel stood at his window , waiting for Barkai to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Park next to the Knesseth , he watched a group of children playing war . One intrepid boy climbed a tree , waiting until two unsuspecting comrades crossed under him ; Id  | then he jumped and quickly stabbed both of them in the back with a rubber dagger . The two boys fell to the ground in mock death throes . Seconds later they got up and began arguing about who would play the paratrooper next and who would have to be the Arabs . Though their game saddened him , the Colonel felt a vague sense of well-being  --  at least in this generation the Jews would fight back . The sight of the children made him think about Rabbi Sassoon 's and Nissim Kimche 's offspring . It was not beyond the Syrians to induce parents to cooperate by threatening to torture their children ; they 'd done so before , most recently on the eve of the American newscameramen 's arrival in Damascus . The Colonel reached into his pocket for a cigar , then changed his mind . For weeks he 'd wondered if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven children . He knew why , in the end , he 'd decided it was . The potential propaganda value of the kids was enormous . For why would the leaders of a community voluntarily send away their children knowing if they did that they would never see them again ? The international news media had to draw the correct conclusion : the plight of Syria 's Jews was that bad . The Colonel closed his eyes and tried to rest for a moment . Lately he had been burdened by a growing sense of national insecurity  --  a feeling that Israel was alone among the nations , a thorn sticking in the massive flank of the world , a state whose existence irritates even her friends . The pressure grew increasingly harder for him to shoulder after the expulsion from UNESCO , as Israel was pushed still farther from the family of nations . Sometimes he wondered if the world was n't right . Maybe the Jews were committing some fundamental , perhaps catastrophic error , which if not rectified , would doom 80  | the Israelis and Arabs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lieutenant Barkai said from the open doorway . The Colonel slowly turned back from the window . " Please shut the door and sit down . " Barkai complied immediately . " I was n't interrupting you , was I ? " " No , " the Colonel said , falling heavily into his chair . " I was waiting for you . How did it go on Cyprus ? " " Satisfactory , sir . By now the Syrian Second Bureau should be on to Ari . " The Colonel nodded and lit a Montecruz . " Do you think there 's any chance she suspected you were an Israe-li ? " " No , from her point of view I could be from any one of a dozen intelligence services . Besides , looking at it from the other side , why would we be setting up our own man ? If we wanted to get rid of him surely there would be more direct methods . " The Colonel looked hard at the Syrian-born lieutenant . " You spoke to Ben-Sion before he left for Damascus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Barkai stalled . " I do n't think he 's quite as sharp as he once was . Apparently he never realized you - maneuvered him into volunteering for the mission . " " Beyond that ? " " I 'd rather not say , sir . I really do n't know him well enough . " The Colonel blew a puff of smoke into the air . " You did n't like this assignment much , did you ? " " It 's not a question of like or dislike , " Barkai snapped . " I followed your orders . " The Colonel nodded , pleased that Barkai understood the moral code of field agents . " Lieutenant , intelligence work has one law : it 's justified by results . At times you 81  | may be asked to do things that will seem immoral to you . Indeed , in the Biblical classroom , in the everyday world , they are immoral ; but not to the Service . Results , not morality , save lives , and the business we 're in is saving Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what Ari went to Syria to do . "  | IN THE MORNING Kim took the stairs to the second floor . Though Ari would have liked her to stay , the plan developed in Jerusalem demanded his bed be available . After she left he went down to the lobby and waited for Mustafa Suidani , al-Husseini 's assistant . The next few hours proved to be commercially productive . Ari bought a hundred and fifty backgammon sets and ordered them shipped to his company in Frankfurt . If anyone cared to check , the firm , Transworld Enterprises , was a legitimate one . When he left the factory he took one of the sets with him , explaining that he would send it ahead as a sample . He would mail it to Frankfurt , but not until he had coded a message about the lost transmitter and hidden the slip of paper in the board game . Richtman , certain to find the arrival of the small package unusual , would search it carefully . After Suidani dropped him back at the hotel , Ari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made up . He phoned Kim 's room , and a half-hour later they were speeding in a rented car toward Mount Kassioun , intent on escaping from the heat that hung over the city . Driving out Farouk El Awal Boulevard , they entered the orchards of al-Ghutah . On both sides of the road  | trees pushed up through the dry earth , their branches laden with apples , plums , figs , and mandarins . Irrigation channels flowed everywhere , fighting a constant battle with the sun . Farther north , on the outskirts of the Mohajirine district , women , holding their pantaloons above their knees , crushed apricots in stone troughs , while children picked the kernels from the gruel . At the base of the rolling foothills of Mount Kassioun , the road ended . They climbed through the trees , the air cooling as they wound upward along a path cut by the hoofs of sheep and goats . Finally Ari plopped down on a grassy knoll . Kim collapsed at his side , somehow panting and laughing at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He nodded , following her gaze up to Jabel al-Sheik , Biblical Mount Hermon , where Nimrod the hunter had dwelt , and near which the tribe of Dan had settled after fleeing from the Philistines . For a long time he stared at the snow-capped peak , beyond whose summit stretched the land he loved , but between whose borders he was not content to live . An ironic paradox . A long way to the west poplar trees surged up the Anti-Lebanon Mountains . On a further slope the Jordan River , beginning as a bubbling spring , trickled toward the Dead Sea . To the east the orchards pushed back the desert , drawing around Damascus like protecting soldiers . Beyond the outskirts of the city rose the barren mounds of el-Aswad and Mania ; behind them the sand continued until it joined the sky . " Do you ever laugh ? " Kim asked , leaning against his back . " That 's a strange question . " " Do you ? " " Of course I laugh . " 84  | " I just wondered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandwiches the hotel had made , and handed one to him . " You know , a relationship between an older man and a younger woman never works . " He bit into the dark bread . " Then why are you here ? " " I do n't know , maybe you remind me of my father , " she said jokingly , hoping he would smile . But he did n't . Suddenly the warm wind rose , rustling through the olive and walnut trees surrounding the glen where they sat . Kim gazed down into the valley , following a flock of sheep with her eyes . " I 'm a little afraid of you , " she said . " Afraid of what ? " " I 'm not sure . I just sense there 's a whole part of you that 's hidden , that I ca n't get to . Sometimes I reach out but instead of feeling flesh , I touch a wall . It 's as if there 's something important I do n't know . Every time I get close to discovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe that 's what frightens me . " Kim stroked his hand . " Do you understand what I 'm saying ? " " Not really . " She turned away in frustration . A long silence followed , broken finally by Kim . " What do you believe in ? " " Results , " he said without hesitation . " What do you mean , results ? " " Winning . " She sensed he was not talking about business , about closing the big deal , beating out the competition . " You mean like in a war , defeating the other side . " " That , or crushing the enemy within yourself . " " What enemy ? What is it you 're fighting ? " " What makes you think I 'm fighting anything ? " " I can feel it . It 's like there 's a bunch of people locked in combat inside you , with none of them able to emerge victorious . Everything seems so contradictory . Sometimes I almost think you do n't know who you are . " 85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , a low bellow that seemed to burst from deep within him . " You 've been reading too much Freud , " he said mockingly . He hurt her ; it showed in her eyes . She had tried to open an entrance into understanding him , only to have the door slammed shut in her face . She could not have known she 'd trod on a raw nerve , that he 'd laughed only to protect himself from her painful probing . It bothered him that she 'd been so accurate , that she sensed so much in so short a time . It was disarming , as well as potentially dangerous . Later , as they walked in the tall grass toward the Tomb of Abel , a small boy sitting among the rocks held out a bunch of pink grapes and stuck his hand in his pocket signifying he wanted money for the fruit . Ari shook his head no and to his surprise the boy did not run after them to pursue his offer . Instead he started eating the grapes himself . Kim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small secluded meadow , they lay down , deciding to rest for a while . The tall blades of grass rippling in the wind enclosed their bodies in a sea of green . A staccato chant rose from the minaret in the valley below , calling the Moslems to prayer . Kim unbuttoned her blouse exposing bare breasts , and brought his head to them . He lay there for a long time feeling the warmth of her chest on his cheek . " I suppose traveling around so much you make love to quite a number of women . " " Does it matter ? " " I guess not , " she said . He turned and looked at her . " I 've been to bed with a lot of women but made love to few . " A smile flicked the corners of her mouth , then it disappeared . " You had a bad dream last night . You were 86  | mumbling in your sleep  --  something about barking dogs , an oven , and the smell . I could n't make any sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is anything the mat-ter ? " " No , " he said , pulling her on top of him . " I 'm sure it was nothing . " 87  | THE BAZAARS of Damascus , thin , crooked streets , flanked by open shops and overhung with clothes , seem to cry out in shame . Not because the beauties of the past have vanished , but because they 've degenerated . For decades advancement has meant the ebb of artistry ; changelessness , a slavish cleaving to the past . At best the work of the old masters is carefully copied . The crafts themselves , once proudly utilitarian , now service the tasteless tourists . The heavily inlaid trays , copper veined with sil- ' I ver or brass , seem clumsy , anachronistic . Where once an old man took fifteen days to pound out the black designs painted on the metal surface of a small plate , now a series of young boys work on an assembly line , each specializing in a specific part of the design . Rarely is a piece wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid you may be disappointed , " Franz Ludin said to Ari as they walked under the vaulted roof of rusty , corrugated tin that covered the Street Called Straight . " The garments in the Suq el-Bzouriye are mostly woven from synthetic fabrics . " Shops pushing in from both sides of the street left only a narrow , noisy passageway between them . The air , trapped under the roof , was thick and hot . Somewhere 88  | near here , Ari remembered , the disciple Ananais received a vision from the Lord commanding him to go unto the house of Judas on the Street Called Straight and inquire after a man named Saul . Cured of his blindness and converted by Ananais , Saul of Tarsus , renowned as the scourge of Christians in Jerusalem , became Paul the Apostle . Ludin stretched out his hand , waving it at the donkey carts and motorized rickshas loaded with an array of fresh vegetables , rolls of damask , and electrical appliances . " At one time this was a mile-long , hundred-footwide thoroughfare known as Doconomos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doconomos is fifteen feet below us and only one of the seven great Roman gates of Damascus still stands . " Ari smiled to himself , thinking Ludin , if not fated to be born in the century of Nazism , would have wanted to spend his years as a Roman . " Ahmud Azziz , a young merchant I know , sells handloomed dresses of the purest silk , " Ludin continued as they skirted around a mound of dung left recently by one of the donkeys . " Maybe he can direct you to quality merchandise selling at a reasonable price . " " I hope so , " Ari said . " It is certainly worth speaking to him about it . " They passed into a narrow cobbled alley shot through with patches of sunlight streaming down from the holes in the roof overhead . The scent of crushed rose petals freshened the air . " There 's a perfume factory nearby , Damascus rosewater , " Ludin explained , as they moved through an entrance in the stone alley leading to a courtyard . Ludin circled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy brass knocker that hung on the door , and pounded the wood several times . " Azziz does n't have a phone so I could n't call him , but he 's 89  | usually home Friday afternoons . " There was no discernible sound of movement within , so Ludin rapped sharply on the door again . Still no response . " It seems Azziz is not in , " he said , turning to Ari . " I 'm afraid I 've wasted your time . " " Nonsense . I enjoy the opportunity to just walk around Damascus and talk to you . Besides , visiting these merchants and haggling over prices become tiring after a while . I think I 'm ready for some diversion . " " Tell me , what can I show you ? Damascus is overflowing with exotic sights : the tomb of Saladin , the minaret of Hisham , the Tekkiyeh of Suleiman , the Madrassa Selimiya . " " Excuse me , Herr Ludin . Your offer is most gracious . But after one has been sightseeing all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " My friend , if there is something you would like to do instead  --  the baths , a woman . Please , just ask . " " Well , when we dined with al-Husseini you did mention something about Jews in Syria . I was quite intrigued . Do you think it would be possible for me to witness your methods of dealing with them ? " Ludin smiled in self-contentment at his continuing role in the drama of the destruction of the Jews . For a second Ari lost himself ; he wanted to pounce on the former German propagandist , kick that smile off his face , crush it under his foot . He knew that murdering Ludin would make him no better than the animal the Nazi was , but that did n't matter . It did n't matter at all . " I like you , " Ludin said , wrapping his arm around Ari 's shoulder and leading him back toward Straight Street , past a bakery with a yellow pyramid of stale berazlik biscuits stacked in the window and slabs of makrouk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone 90  | floor . " Germany is getting weak , effeminate . The young are falling over themselves trying to imitate American dress and music . They ignore their Aryan heritage . Goethe , Schopenhauer , Nietzsche are abandoned for the likes of Gunter Grass , a blubbering schoolboy who peddles the myth of German guilt for profit . Fools , all of them ! They 're blinded by self-righteous sentimentality . For the time being we must abandon Germany , our work lies here in the Middle East . Before we can return we must slash the arteries of Israel and drown the Zionists in their own blood . " " And the Jews of Syria ? " " We practice on them . Come , I 'll show you . " " In 1947 there were twenty-five thousand Jews in Damascus and over forty thousand in the entire country , " Ludin said as they parked the car on El Amine Street on the fringes of the Jewish quarter . " Today a little over four thousand remain , and soon ... " He lifted his hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into suggestion . They got out of the car and began to walk . A bus , brown with Iraqi dust , rumbled by , spewing dark exhaust into the air . " Now only a few streets still belong to the Jews , " Ludin continued . Ari knew the history of the Jews of Damascus well ; Tsur had drilled the details into him . The Christians have sliced into the Haret al Yahoud from the north , the Moslems from the west and south . The streets where the Jews live are quiet . The doors of sunken courtyards are edged open and slammed shut to receive children from school . The walls are broken and crumbling . A subdued flow of Arabic parts the silence from various windows , the words often sounding like prayers . The use of Hebrew is met by beatings . Palestinians roam the streets at will ; rape is not uncommon . Residents of the quarter 91  | have been known to leave their apartments to walk across the street , only to return months later . Some do n't return at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described , they are sent back in separate pieces . Ludin approached the two soldiers lounging on the corner of El Amine and El Hadjara streets . He uttered a phrase in Arabic and presented a card to the elder of the two privates . Immediately they grabbed their lightweight , Japanese-built Armalite rifles , bolted up from the sidewalk and stood rigidly to attention . Ludin swore at them in a German they could n't possibly understand and headed up El Hadjara Street with Ari . Far off in the west the sun had dipped beneath the mountains of Lebanon , spraying clouds of bright orange through the evening sky . The snowcapped peak of Hermon stood silhouetted in the orange mist , slowly fading from view with the descending of night . " We have plans to significantly reduce the size of the Jewish population here , " Ludin said , his lips curving into a smile . " But we must retain a small number whose position can be exploited for internal consumption . In the eventuality of a setback at the front , the populace must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is healthy . " " What are the chances of any of the Jews actually having contact with Israel ? " Ludin laughed . " The word Musawi , follower of Moses , is stamped in red on their identification cards . They ca n't visit abroad or emigrate ; a government ordinance requires they obtain written permission before leaving the city ; soldiers are posted at all entrances to the quarter ; Palestinians are housed everywhere among them  --  they hardly talk to each other . Contact with Israel is impossible . " 92  | " I see . What about a synagogue ? I assume there once was one in the ghetto . " " What do you mean , once . There are two main synagogues , the Al-Frange and the old Jawbar synagogue . You would n't want the American politicians protesting about religious intolerance in Syria , would you ? " Ludin laughed and Ari forced himself to join in . " Come on , I 'll show you the Jawbar ; the Al-Frange is where we take the tourists and newspaper reporters . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ari said , trying to be flippant . Ludin laughed even louder . " I think they might be persuaded to allow us to enter anyway . " The stone synagogue was dark . Fifteen , maybe twenty old men sat on divans against the walls , all , it seemed , muttering different prayers . The couches were of a faded red , ragged and torn . No one stood on the raised platform in the center of the room to lead the congregation in prayer . One door of the ark was missing and the other swung loosely on its hinges . It hardly mattered , for there were no Torah scrolls for the doors to protect . The floor of the synagogue was mosaic and the walls covered with aged tapestries . Though rows of candelabras hung from the ceiling only one light , directly over the dais , was lit . Nobody looked up or whispered when they entered . The old Jews just continued to pray , as their ancestors had for centuries . " They huddle here and wait for their messiah to come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We managed to kill off six million of them , and they learn nothing . With the smell of burning bodies in the air they marched to the gas chambers , praying . Clearly a pathological people . But then you were at Dachau , this is not new to you . " 93  | Ari nodded . Haunting Hebrew melodies droned in the background beneath their loudly spoken German . " As a whole I find them wretched creatures , " Ari said . " That is , with one small exception . " " What is that ? " " Herr Ludin , I do n't dare tell you . I 'm afraid you will look upon me with disgust . " " Nonsense . You are a German , a former SS officer . " " But in front of you I 'm embarrassed to talk about my weakness . " " We all have weaknesses . Besides , I 'm an expert on the Jewish Question . I may be able to be of assistance . " Ari bit his lower lip . " I need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ludin nodded . " I know a clean restaurant that serves liquor . It 's just outside the walls . " As Ari followed him out of the synagogue he cast a final glance back at the old men . They moved along winding streets , then passed through the Bab Kaysan , a huge Ottoman gate that opened onto the spacious Ibn Assaker Boulevard . The restaurant was only a short distance away . Inside , they sat at a table with a red and white checkered tablecloth and ordered a bottle of arak . The room , brightly illuminated , was long and narrow , with copper plates dotting the yellow walls . After the arak was set before them Ludin rolled his glass between his hands . " Now tell me , what is it that 's troubling you ? " Ari drank off half his glass and looked down at the floor . " It began at Dachau . Some of the officers . . . well , it would get lonely . . . months on end without female company . There were no women around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real women . So a few of us decided since in the end we were going to kill them anyway , there 94  | really would n't be any harm in taking a female in for the night , as long as we were careful not to allow any of them to live long enough to bear our children . Some of the officers bribed them with food . There was always a large number of the animals who would do anything for a few scraps of meat , but they did n't seem to do anything for me . Those girls always licked your ass and begged to come back the next night . But one day a dark little Jewess named Rachael was assigned to one of my labor details . She could n't have been more than eighteen or nineteen . When I asked her if she 'd like to come to my quarters she spit in my face . I had two enlisted men carry her to my room on the spot and then , well , I availed myself of her . " Nervously he gulped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Rachael ? " Ludin asked , his tone flat . " Exhilarating , absolutely beyond description . I 'd previously experienced nothing causing comparable excitement . After she was gassed there were others , all defiant , resentful , angry , and young . Since the war I 've slept with many women . " He filled his glass and took a long drink . " But it has never been the same . " Ludin stared silently across the table . Ari looked away from him ; it was essential that Ludin make the next move . " You have surprised me , " the Nazi said , withdrawing a pack of cigarettes from his coat pocket . " Would you care for one ? " He held the pack outstretched in his arm . Ari took a cigarette and lit it . Ludin had to react sympathetically , the entire mission depended on it . He drew a mouthful of warm smoke deep into his lungs . Ludin slowly removed a cigarette , but left it dangling between his fingers . " I 've heard of other cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from raping Jewish women . We shall not speak around the issue , you did rape them . " Ari took a long drag off the cigarette , agree-95  | ing with Ludin by his silence . " The question remains as to why only Jewish women . Possibly your attraction is a manifestation of a hatred of women . Or a projection of some self-hatred . Or a misplaced fear that sleeping with a decent German woman bridges over to a violation of your mother . We would have to spend a long time together before I could uncover the source of your abnormality and be of any assistance . " Forcing his hand to shake , Ari reached for his glass and brought the licorice-tasting liquid to his mouth . It it was n't going right . Ludin was reacting like a psychiatrist outlining future therapy options for a patient . " But I can see why you led me to the point where I conveniently dragged the story out of you , " Ludin continued . " You are looking for another Jew-bitch sex goddess right here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . " Maybe you 'd like a nineteen-year-old , small , dark and defiant  --  another Rachael . " Ari crushed out his cigarette . It was important that he gain this Nazi 's respect ; it might be crucial later . " Listen , I 'm not asking you for anything , " he said , almost angrily . " If you want to do me a favor , fine , I 'll accept it . But I wo n't bend down and kiss your feet in gratitude . " Ludin touched him gently on the arm . " Do not get defensive , my friend . We are both Germans of the old order . There are not so many of us left that we can afford the luxury of dissension among ourselves . Go back to the hotel , have dinner and wait . I 'll deliver someone to your room in a couple of hours . " Ari smiled faintly and hurried out of the restaurant . Close to three and a half hours elapsed before there was a knock on his door . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl into the room . She was short , dark , and had small brown eyes that darted quickly around the hotel suite . Ari did n't need to be told that she hated her captors . The girl tried to squirm free from the arm one of the policemen held tightly around her waist . " If she does n't stop that throw her on the floor , " Ari said . At the sound of his voice the girl went rigid . " You may let her go . " The policeman dropped his hand and the girl , suddenly with no one to fight , remained still . " We were instructed to deliver this woman and to leave a number where we can be reached . You may phone us when you want her returned , " the officer who had held the girl said , holding out a slip of paper . Ari nodded and took it from him . " You two may go now , thank you . " The officers turned and left . " What did they tell you ? " Ari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that if I did n't come and please you my father and mother would be beaten . " She spat out the words and began unbuttoning her blouse . " Have you ever slept with a man before ? " " I 've been raped twice , " she said coldly . " Once by a Palestinian and once by the policeman I reported the crime to . " " Your name is Rachael Khatib , is n't it ? You have a brother named Yair who lives with his wife and two children on Haroe Street in Haifa . Your favorite color is yellow and you have a scar on your upper right thigh from a pot of boiling water that Yair accidentally spilled on you . " In fabricating the story of his sexual transgressions at Dachau he had described Rachael as the type of Jewess he desired , mentioning her name in the hope Ludin  | would send her and not another girl . The plan was not as tenuous as it first seemed , for Rachael was the only young Jewess left in Damascus with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped a ring with a small turquoise stone off his finger and held it out to her . She took it hesitantly , staring at the ring and then back at him , fear frozen on her face . " How did you get Yair 's ring ? How do you know about me ? " " I 'm an Israeli , " he said . She stared at him in utter disbelief . " But the police . . . " " They think I 'm a former Nazi . You need n't concern yourself with the details . I 've come to take Rabbi Sassoon 's and Nissim Kimche 's children to Israel . We 're worried they 're going to be used to pressure their parents into cooperating with the authorities . Success will depend on how quickly we move and how quietly . I do n't want you to speak to anyone except Nissim Kimche about what I 'm going to tell you . Everyone else is to think you were raped . Is that clear ? " She nodded . " What do you want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got up from the edge of the bed and brought a chair over , " I think you will be more comfortable sitting down . " She smiled and took a seat near him . He was amazed at her calm , at the tears she had not shed when confronted with her brother 's ring . Ari now knew why the Colonel had insisted he contact her  --  she was controlled and unusually strong . " Now , " he said , trying to comfort her with a smile , " I want you to arrange it so that two weeks from today on the twenty-second ... " Just then there was a knock at the door . " Quick , on the bed , " Ari whispered . Understanding , she kicked off her shoes , loosened her blouse , and dropped onto the mattress . He pulled his shirt off and ran his fingers through  | his hair , mussing it . When he opened the door Kim was standing in the hall wearing a short skirt and a tightfitting body blouse , cut well below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ; then she saw the girl lying on the bed . For an instant she stood immobile , unable to speak , her eyes attached to his naked chest . " Kim . " " I should have called , but I did n't think ... " " No , it 's not what it looks like . " A heaviness pressed down on him . It was happening again ; his job was encroaching on his private life , threatening to destroy it , the way it destroyed Yael . " It could n't possibly be what it looks like , " she said sarcastically . " You 're just having a business meeting . She 's quoting you the latest figures on Damascene furniture . " " Come outside . " He grabbed her hand and pulled her into the hall , closing the door behind them . " I know I 'm young , but should n't that girl be home doing her schoolwork . " " Stop it , " he said roughly . " I ca n't explain , but there 's nothing between me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you 're half undressed . " " Kim , no , " he half demanded , half pleaded . " If there 's nothing going on why is she lying on your bed and why ca n't you explain ? " The hall was empty , quiet . " Because if I explained your life would be in danger . " As soon as the words left his mouth he regretted speaking them . A shadow of fear crossed her face , darkening her eyes . " What is it ? Who is that girl ? What 's she doing in your room ? What are you doing in Damascus ? " " I ca n't tell you ! " he said , frustration breaking off the edges of his words . 99  | She clutched onto his arm . " Let 's get out of here , out of this hotel and out of Damascus . I 'll go with you anywhere you say . We can take a plane in the morning . I 'll finish my pictures later . I 'm frightened . You 're involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leave now , forget whatever it is you 're doing . " He drew her close and kissed her . For a second she seemed to fight him , but only for a second . Dropping her head to his shoulder , she looked up at his small eyes . " Please let 's leave . It ca n't be that important . " " It is . Trust me . " Gently he pushed her away from him . " I have to go inside now . I 'll call you tomorrow . " With that he turned and went back to Rachael and the Service .  | IN THE MORNING Ari picked up the scrap of paper lying next to the phone , dialed , and arranged for the officers to come for Rachael . As she emerged from the other room he suddenly thought about Dov Elon . This girl would have been perfect for him . He could just picture them romping through the fields on Dov 's kibbutz , wringing the sweetness out of life the way one squeezed the juice from an orange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was the use ? For all practical purposes , Dov was dead . He crossed the room and stared out the window at the harsh sunlight already glinting off the tiled roofs of the city . Ari wondered about his colleague . Strangely enough , though one of the things he was supposed to find out was how much Dov had told his interrogators , he did n't even know what the young intelligence officer had been doing in Damascus . When he 'd asked , the Colonel had hedged , explaining that the knowledge would be an unnecessary burden in the event he was captured and interrogated . Such secrecy bothered Ari . In the old days the Colonel had never withheld information from him . After Rachael had been taken away Ari sat on the edge 101  | of the bed and looked at the bottle of arak resting on the nightstand . The liquid was clear with a slight green-black tint to it . He 'd been drinking a bit too much recently and he knew it . Reaching over a pillow , he poured a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by throwing the contents down his throat he could faster forget his drinking it . Remembering the unmade bed in the next room , he slowly got up . Details are of paramount importance , he repeated to himself . The whole mission could be foiled by a cleaning lady finding underwear bearing a suspicious label , or the extra bed slept in when the gentleman had brought a young woman to his suite for the express purpose of sexual liaison . He tugged at the sheets and blankets on the bed where Rachael had slept , trying to smooth the wrinkles out of them . But whenever he pulled on one end of the blanket , inevitably a new crease appeared someplace else . Angrily he moved to the head of the bed and drew the blanket taut , stuffing the edges underneath the mattress . When the bedspread was in place he moved back into the main room , noting , to his dismay , that his breathing was labored and his forehead damp . He was slipping and although the realization was painful , he no longer could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untimely affair with Michelle on Cyprus , then in Damascus Airport he let that stupid kid take the transmitter from under his nose . But an incident that occurred in Jerusalem , right after the Colonel 's final briefing , worried him most of all . Late in the afternoon he had been walking past the construction site at Kiryat Wolfson when a terrific explosion rocked the earth . Instinctively he dove to the ground . He lay there huddled against himself for a long time  --  his hands shaking , his heart beating wildly . Finally 102  | he realized the blast had been caused by construction workers dynamiting foundations through the stony crust of the city . An hour later his hands were still trembling . The Colonel would call it a sign . Ari wiped the sweat from his brow and reached for the phone . When the receptionist came on he asked for Kim 's room . The phone rang for a long time before she answered . " Did I wake you ? " he asked . " No , I was in the shower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have breakfast together ? " " What about your friend ? Is n't she hungry ? " " She 's gone . " " Already . What 's the matter , was n't she very good ? " " Kim ! " " Okay , okay . I 'm sorry . " She paused and then spoke softly , " I 'm sorry . " " What about breakfast ? " " I ca n't . I 'm going out to take some pictures this morning . The Foreign Ministry phoned a little while ago ; the Israelis bombed the refugee camp at Khan esh Shih just after sunrise , killing a lot of civilians . The Ministry offered to provide a car and driver if I was interested in photographing the damage . I 'm being picked up in twenty minutes . " " I see . " There was a long silence parted by Kim . " Can we have dinner instead ? " " I guess so . " " What time ? " she asked . " How about seven , here in the hotel ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call you when I 'm ready . " Kim slowly returned the receiver to its place and relaxed the grip on the towel wrapped around her body . 103  | It fell to the floor exposing her full breasts and Rat stomach . She looked at herself with satisfaction . It pleased Kim that he wanted her . Ari wandered aimlessly through the Suq el-Bzouriye , thinking about the mission . He would meet Rachael one more time , pass the information to Lieutenant Barkai , then fly out of Damascus . In less than two weeks the children would be in Jerusalem . Ari wondered where he would be . He turned a corner into a dark and deserted passageway . Muddy water trickled down the alley , flanked by jewelers working in tiny , glass-fronted shops . Their wares  --  turquoise-studded bracelets , agate rings , and heavy brooches  --  were all oppressively alike . Farther on an old man sitting on a stool in the dirt , smoking his nargileh , looked up at Ari . " English . You speak English ? " he asked , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled and stopped . " An American tourist ? " " Something like that , " he said . The old man pulled a wooden box from under his stool and lifted the lid , exposing a jumbled array of glass vials . He reached in , grabbed a handful , and motioned his potential customer nearer . " Perfumes , the sweet blossoms of Damascus . " He studied the labelless vials for a long moment , finally choosing an amber-colored one . Uncorking it , he dabbed Ari 's wrist with the top . The smell of sandalwood rose from his skin . " It 's very nice , " Ari said , bringing his hand close to his nose . The old man grinned , exposing a set of rotting teeth . Quickly he dabbed Ari 's arm with the tangled aromas of musk , violet , jasmine , and chypre. 104  | " Enough , " Ari said , as the scent of orange blossoms was rubbed near his elbow . " How much ? " The old man studied his customer 's face , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One for four pounds or five for fifteen pounds , " he said after a minute . Ari smiled . " Surely you are not serious . The bottles are tiny . I 'll give you ten pounds for five of them . " " Ya-allah ! That is half price . It 's impossible . I can not . " He started to put the vials away , then stopped . " Ten for twenty-five pounds . Think of your woman . Give her my perfume and she will make love to you fifty , a hundred times more passionately . " Ari smiled . " Five for twelve pounds . " " I can not possibly go lower than fourteen . " " Not even to thirteen ? " " No . It 's too cheap . You are stealing food off my table . My grandchildren will starve . " " Well , then I guess we can not agree on a price . " He shrugged and started to walk away . " Thirteen pounds fifty piasters is my final offer , " the old man called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hunting through the thick wad of currency , he found a twenty-pound note , handed it to the old man , and received his change and the bottles in return . The merchant smiled ; he 'd made a healthy profit . As Ari continued down the deserted alley he realized suddenly that someone was following him . He glanced up ahead . Wood doors leading to cramped apartments lined both sides of the passageway . Quickening his pace , he listened . There were two , no , three pairs of feet that also increased their gait . Caught in an alley with no avenue of escape , he cursed himself for not bothering with extra precautions . 105  | The footsteps were approaching rapidly . He searched the ground for a stick , a sharp stone , a piece of glass . There was nothing . But there 's always something : a watch , an ashtray , a business card  --  anything that can gouge or cut becomes a weapon in trained hands . He reached into his pocket , pulled out a ball-point pen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The footsteps chased after him . Ari glanced back . Three young Arabs . No chance of escape . He spun around and crouched , clutching the pen like a dagger . He was quite calm . The Arabs stopped and approached slowly . Two carried clublike sticks . The third held a length of pipe menacingly in front of him . Ari backed up against the wall . Give them less of a target , he told himself . " We want your wallet , " the one with the pipe said . " You 're going to give your dollars to the Palestinians for a change . " They must have watched him buying the perfume . " I 'm not an American , " he said . " I 'm a German , a friend of the Arabs . " " Liar . " The young man lifted his pipe and moved closer , his eyes scorched with hate . " Wait ! " Ari shouted , reaching for his back pocket . " Here . " He tossed his wallet and pen at the man 's feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . He grabbed the arm holding the pipe and pulled it down hard against his knee . The pipe flew out of the man 's grasp and bounced noisily on the floor of the alley . Then with a powerful cutting blow he drove the side of his hand into the man 's neck , pulled him up again by the shirt , and hit him in the face with an upward thrust of his open fist . As he slumped to the pavement the other two charged . Ari bent his left shoulder low to the ground and lashed  | out with his right foot , catching one Arab in the small of the stomach and propelling him against the wall . The other swung the stick at his head . Ari managed to throw up his arm . The blow glanced off it and harmlessly hit his shoulder . With a cutting chop he struck the man 's wrist , knocking the club to the ground , then quickly drove a knee hard into his groin . As the man cried out and fell backward Ari heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned around just as the blow came . It seemed to part his skull . The alley spun . He felt a warm , tingling sensation . Then nothing . As he lost consciousness he thought he heard voices and the sounds of a scuffle around him . He woke , surprised to find he was propped against the wall of the alley . He 'd been struck somewhere in the middle of the narrow street ; he must have fallen to the ground there . Who could have moved him ? On a hunch , he felt his back pocket . His wallet was in place . He pulled it out and found , as he expected , that nothing was missing . Not even the Syrian currency . As he stood up a wave of pain rolled through his head . He touched the back of his skull . There was no blood . He was n't hurt badly . He took a few steps in the direction he 'd originally come from then bent to the ground . Something had caught his eye . A series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering the pavement . There were six of them . It was as if three men had been dragged away by the shoulders , the heels of their shoes leaving these tracks . Slowly Ari walked back toward the Street Called Straight , trying to sort out what had happened . If the muggers were irate Palestinians , and even that was uncertain  --  then who had attacked them , returned his wallet , and fled rather than reveal their identities ? He saw  | only two possibilities . Lieutenant Barkai , following him for some unknown reason , could have rushed to his aid the moment he was in physical danger . But he dismissed that idea immediately . Barkai was due in the country on the twelfth , four days from now . He would n't have ar- il rived early , even as a precautionary measure , not unless he was involved in something much bigger than the escape of seven children . And that was impossible  --  Ari would have known . The other possibility , the Syrian police , was equally implausible . For if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly they would take him to a hospital . On the other hand , they might not have called a doctor if they knew who he really was , but if that was the case they would n't have bothered protecting him in the first place . The whole incident just made no sense . He realized the best thing to do now was to put the dilemma out of his mind  --  to let his subconscious work on the problem in its own way . The answer would come to him in due time . Back at the New Ommayad Ari took three aspirin and climbed into the shower . He had a nasty bump on his head but the swelling would go away in a few days . He 'd phone room service and have some ice sent up as soon as he was dry . The jets of hot water streamed against his body , the steam clouding the tiled bathroom . The oppressive heat of Damascus drained him . He decided he would try and rest for a few hours before meeting Kim for dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been seated in the hotel dining room . " Screaming women , crying children unable to find their parents , bleeding bodies strewn in the rubble . I took a picture of one young man sitting on the steps of a wooden shack , the tears rolling  | down his face . He held his dead son in his arms . " " Do you know why the refugee camp was bombed ? " " Kol Yisrael Radio is claiming a commando group that infiltrated the Golan Heights and attacked a school there was trained in Khan esh Shih . " Ari picked up the menu and stared blankly at the Arabic and French lettering . He wondered if the Israeli retaliatory raid accomplished anything , if it edged the Middle East closer to peace , if attacking a refugee camp brought any measure of comfort to the families of those slain in the Golan . He shook his head in sadness . He accepted the raid for what it was : the Israelis ' attempt to mask a pervasive sense of helplessness with an excessive show of strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence . Ari belonged to that school of men who believed war should be fought exclusively by soldiers . " What are you going to do with the pictures ? " he asked , putting the menu down and sipping the water . " I 've already sent them to my editor . I think they illustrate graphically the senselessness of these killings . I hope they 'll be printed and given wide circulation , with or without my name . " " Why ? What possible good will it do to show the absurdity of raids and retaliation ? Everybody already knows killing is senseless . Can your pictures ground the war planes or silence the shelling ? Will a photograph splashed across the cover of Newsweek save one life ? " " Maybe not , but at least the world will see what 's really happening here . People are deadened by the sterile recital of statistics ; so many casualties this week in Middle East fighting , so many planes lost , so much money spent . But one picture , one sensitive layout can move millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved , " he said angrily . " What  | difference does it make ? Are they going to cease digging graves in Khan esh Shih or the Golan Heights because people are moved ? " " Well at least it 's a place to start . " He wanted to say , " Yes , the wrong place , " but he stopped himself . He realized suddenly that his anger was misdirected ; he was venting his frustration on her . The afternoon 's events and his inability to understand them had set him on edge . A long silence held . She toyed with her silverware as if she was pondering what to say next . Finally she studied his face and spoke : " Who was that girl in your room last night ? " " I ca n't tell you , Kim . " " Why not ? " " It 's best that you do n't know . " His voice was soft , contrite . " That sounds like an excuse . " " I want you to trust me . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , to meet you in Damascus . I do , and you jump into bed with another girl , state that you ca n't explain because my life would be in danger , and after all that you expect me to simply keep quiet and trust you ? " He said nothing . It was becoming increasingly difficult to play the role of Hans Hoffmann in her presence . " Who are you ? " she asked , her voice starting to quake . " Nothing makes any sense . What were you doing in Israel ? Why did you suddenly decide to come to Syria ? Who was that girl ? What was she doing in your room last night ? This import-export business is some sort of front , I know it . What are you really doing in the Middle East ? " " Kim , do n't ask any more questions . " " Why the hell not ? " Ari felt the shadow of the Service creeping behind  | him . As soon as he 'd changed passports in Frankfurt he had become Hans Hoffmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play that role with everyone , regardless of personal considerations . But he was finding it nearly impossible to continue doing so with her . " I lied to you when I was in Israel , " he said . The rest of his sentence stuck in his throat ; he had to force the words out . " I did n't tell you everything about me . " " I know that . " He thought about the three Palestinians and his mysterious rescue . There was a chance that somehow the Syrians had broken his cover ; if so , she might be in real danger . He had to protect both of them . " I 'm not exactly who I appear to be . " She stared silently into his eyes , waiting . " Telling the truth now is difficult . " He hesitated , uncertain if he did have to tell her . " Go on , " she said . He nodded . " During World War II I was an SS Lieutenant at Dachau concentration camp . " She looked at him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , not that . " She hesitated for a moment , then bolted up , knocking over her water glass . " How could you ? I ca n't . . . " Shaking , she ran toward the exit , bumping into the maitre d ' as she fled the room . Ari sat there , numb . He expected her to be alarmed , upset , a little afraid ; but the intensity of her reaction startled him . She was an American . She could n't even have been born until after the war was over . He stared toward the exit sign , wondering if she had become so emotional because she was half-Jewish . The irony of that possibility paralyzed him . He wanted to get up and chase after her , tell her the truth ; but he knew he could n't , not while they were in Syria .  | NEAR THE JORDANIAN BORDER the narrow highway turned into the twisting main street of Der'a . Proceeding toward the olive wood factory across town , Mustafa Suidani drove the dust-covered Peugeot 404 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter of the village , Ari quickly rolled up the window  --  he preferred the heat to the stench . The corridorlike , shabby streets were strewn with refuse and human waste . Housewives used them as a garbage dump , indiscriminately casting potfuls of water and the remains of food out their windows . Hoards of undernourished children with sick eyes and running noses , wearing only underwear or nightgowns , played among the refuse . Dogs , chickens , camels , and horses wandered around unbridled ; swarms of greenblack flies buzzed over dung heaped in the street . As Suidani navigated a sharp curve he narrowly averted a barefoot man , standing calf-deep in mud , washing his jackass . The donkey brayed plaintively as the car accelerated by . The unpleasant physical surroundings notwithstanding , shopping for merchandise to export to Germany became an enjoyable diversion for Ari . At first he 'd dreaded the day-long trips with Suidani , for they ex-  | pended much time and produced little . But soon he found that it was on these excursions that he could really relax into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , demanded pieces be custom crafted to rigid specifications , and stomped out of shops in mock outrage , only to be called back and have the price lowered , a deal agreed upon , and sweet mint tea served amidst much handshaking and smiling . Ari gained a genuine satisfaction from striking a successful deal , as if he really were a German businessman who would reap succulent profits from his bargaining . As the years bumped into each other , then brushed away , a sense of accomplishment , any accomplishment , was all Ari had left to cling to . Kim was gone . She had departed on a three-day visit to Aleppo without saying good-bye . The desk clerk assured him that the American lady , taking only a small suitcase with her , had not checked out of the hotel . Ari was relieved . He could wait . Aleppo had once been a thriving Jewish community , he remembered from one of the texts Yosef Tsur had given him to read . Then in December , 1947 ? a few months before the partition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty Jewish homes , fifty shops , ten synagogues , five Jewish schools , one orphanage , and one youth club . Afterward the angry mob burned one hundred and sixty Torah scrolls in a public bonfire . No accurate estimate of the number dead could be taken , for thousands of Aleppo 's Jews fled the city and sought refuge in Lebanon , making it impossible to determine if those missing had escaped or been killed . The Syrian Internal Security Service tried to halt this exodus unsuccessfully  --  that is , until they ordered frontier guards to shoot any Jew attempting to cross the border illegally . Emigration ceased ; those left  | behind huddled together waiting for the outbreak of war , hoping for an Israeli victory , yet knowing such a success would be brutally blamed on them . When cholera broke out in Syria in early 1948 a rumor spread that the Jews had poisoned the water . Mobs swept through the ghettos in Aleppo and Damascus  --  the killing and looting began again . Like a ceaseless drumbeat in a night without end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried their dead . Upon " request " they contributed forty thousand Syrian pounds in support of the Arab defense of Palestine . In the years following the 1948 war , with the help of vast sums of money and agents working inside Syria , large numbers of Jews passed illegally into Israel , most of them via Mardjayun , Metulla , and Bint Jubayl . When the Syrian government finally discovered this route and sealed off its southern border , arresting scores of its own citizens on the charge of helping emigrants enter Palestine , Israeli agents opened a corridor from Syria to Lebanon , from whose shores the Jews traveled to Israel by motorboat . Not all arrived safely ; hundreds were caught and imprisoned . Others were not so fortunate . In November , 1950 , a band of Arab seamen smuggled thirty Syrian Jews out of Damascus , promising to take them to Israel . Halfway between Beirut and Haifa the Arabs turned on their passengers , took their valuables , and murdered them . Twenty bodies were washed ashore and buried in Haifa . The trickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War . Immediately after Israeli troops captured the Golan Heights the humiliated Syrians locked a stranglehold on the few thousand Jews left inside the country , imprisoning them in guarded ghettos ? as if afraid that the Jewish community would vanish , depriving the populace of someone to blame for their  | country 's military defeats . Air Force Commander Hafez Assad , taking control of the government in 1971 , eased the restrictions on Syria 's Jews somewhat , but still only a handful had managed to escape since ' sixty-seven . When Ari returned to the hotel from the olive wood factory at Der'a he found a message tucked in his mailbox . He unfolded the yellow piece of paper , hoping the note was from Kim , only to discover that Franz Ludin had called and requested Ari telephone him at his earliest convenience . Disappointed , he moved across the faded red carpet to a house phone in a corner of the lobby and asked the operator to connect him . " Well , how has the buying been going ? " Ludin asked , after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a village in the south today . Vile place , but I found some handcarved olive wood bookends and chests inlaid with camel-bone that I think might sell well in Europe . " " And the price ? " " After an hour of haggling I threatened to find another factory , and the proprietor hastily agreed to a fifty percent reduction . " " Which means he 's still making twenty-five percent . " " At least , " Ari agreed . Ludin laughed . " Listen , I 'm having a few friends over for dinner on the sixteenth , some people I think you 'd ! be interested in meeting . Are you free ? " " If not , I would immediately become so . " " Good , let 's say about seven-thirty . I 'll have a car and river pick you up . " " Excellent . I 'll look forward to seeing you again and Meeting your guests . " " I think you will enjoy yourself . I 'm trying to arrange to have someone you should know join us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But  | he 's not well . It 's uncertain if he will be able to come . " Ari 's mouth went dry . The Colonel had not foreseen any of the old SS officers from Dachau being in residence in Damascus . Heinneman would spot him as a fraud ! " I do n't seem to remember a Hauptsturmfiihrer Heinneman , " he stalled , trying to think cf an excuse for not knowing the infamous Nazi . " But then there were quite a number of officers at Dachau in ' forty-four , ' fortyfive . " " That seems strange . I was sure you two would have worked together . You were in charge of the productive labor of the prisoners and Hauptsturmfiihrer Heinneman was responsible for the Sonderkommandos . Your workers must have been transferred to him after they were no longer strong enough to be of use to you . " The Sonderkommandos ran the gas chambers . Ari realized he 'd better change his story . " Of course . I remember the Hauptsturmfiihrer now . We called him The Kosher Butcher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used it . " He hesitated for a moment , then continued . " We talked on occasion but actually our jobs were quite distinct ; we almost never came into contact . " He knew his explanation was inadequate . " A pity . In any event you should have plenty of old times to talk about . " Sweat formed where Ari held the receiver . " If not , we shall create some stories that never happened , " he said , laughing the way men do when they 're recounting some sexual exploit that is drawn from their imagination rather than their past . He switched the receiver to the other side and wiped his hand on his pants . Somehow he would have to convince Heinneman that he really was an officer at Dachau . He had one thing in his favor  --  he knew Heinneman well . As a young man Ari had peered  | through the barbed concentration camp wire and watched the bald , monocled Nazi strut around the compound . Even after so many years Ari could picture him clearly : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips that always held a cigarette . Heinneman 's most distinctive feature , though , was a raised vein , running along his forehead and part of his cranium , that pulsated when he was angry . Ari was not surprised to hear he was ill ; the Butcher of Dachau had to be seventy or more . Yes , he remembered him  --  a young man does not forget the face of the person who burned two hundred and fifty thousand Jews . " My driver will come for you at seven-fifteen , " Ludin said , snapping Ari back into the present . " I 'll be waiting in the lobby . " " Good , then until Sunday . . . " " Oh , one more thing before you hang up . If it is not too much of an inconvenience , Herr Ludin , that Jewess you sent me . I would n't mind ... " " What time do you want her ? " Ludin asked impatiently . " After dinner . I see no reason to waste good money on feeding her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse me . " " Yes , of course . We will talk Sunday evening . " Ludin said good-bye and hung up . But instead of doing so himself , Ari turned around and faced the center of the lobby , affecting a continued conversation . Sitting in a leather chair on the far side of the room was a small , squat Arab , dressed in a dark business suit . Ari wanted to take a better look at him , for he had caught the Arab glancing up from his book several times while he was speaking to Ludin . At this point Ari was not ready to jump to any hasty conclusions ; he just memorized the  | reader 's face . Satisfied that the Arab 's physiognomy was permanently etched in his memory , he hung up and walked to the front desk . Approaching the bell captain , he took a ten-pound note out of his wallet . " The American , Miss Johnson . When she returns to the hotel I would consider it a favor if you called me . " Ari slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes . " The bell captain took the money and slipped it into his pants pocket . " I 'd prefer that Miss Johnson did not know about this discussion . " " Of course . " Ari nodded and went into the bar , thinking about the incident in the alley and the man with the book , trying to create a connection . If somehow the Syrian Second Bureau had penetrated his cover , to protect him until they learned why he came to Damascus , they might have attacked the muggers . If so , that would explain the man in the lobby : a team of agents would be watching him . He took out a fifty-piaster coin and spun it on the counter . But the Syrians could not have found out he was an Israeli , not so quickly . It was impossible . And the Arab by the phone  --  in all likelihood he was exactly who he appeared to be , a man choosing to read in a cool place rather than venture out in the afternoon heat . Ari ordered an Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts the bartender slid in front of him . When the beer arrived he took a long drink . The cold liquid felt good as it rolled down his throat . He nursed the rest of the Al Chark , sipping it slowly . But an hour later he was still stuck with the same conclusion : only the Mossad and the Second Bureau had sufficient reason to rescue him from the Palestinians .  | As he left the bar he wondered if any Israeli agents he knew nothing about had recently entered the country . Later , he stood on the balcony waiting for Rachael to be delivered to his room . He had asked to see her almost as an afterthought , being careful not to appear overly anxious . Ludin had n't seemed suspicious . Moving inside , Ari opened the dresser drawer and removed a bottle of Chivas Regal . The Scotch , with a stiff eighty percent import tax added on , had cost him a lot of money ; but it was worth it . He was sick of the licorice taste of arak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchase unforeseen necessities , and good Scotch was definitely a necessity . Next to the bottle lay a stack of Villars Larme de Creme chocolate bars . He had wanted to buy Rachael something . Never very good at selecting presents , he settled for the candy after rejecting a dozen more personal items . Sprawled on the bed thumbing through a day-old edition of Le Monde , he was sipping his second glass of Chivas Regal when the sounds of a scuffle in the hallway interrupted his reading . He went to the door , pulled it open , and the same two police officers shoved a girl into the room . " Oh no , " he whispered to himself . It was n't Rachael ! This girl was tall , thin , and at least ten years Rachael 's senior . " What about the other girl ? " he asked , trying to keep 1 his face from registering any alarm . ' " She 's been arrested . We brought you this one instead . " " There 's not much difference between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the floor , trembling . " Call us when you 're done . " The officers turned toward the hallway .  | " Just one more thing , " Ari said , his words halting them in place . " Why was the first girl arrested ? " The taller of the two looked back . " Because she 's a Jew . " Before Ari could ask if there was any connection between Rachael 's visit to the hotel and her arrest , they were gone . As the door slammed shut behind them , tears burst from the girl 's eyes . " Please do n't cry , I 'm not going to hurt you , " Ari said . He went to the dresser , poured two glasses of Scotch , and extended one toward her . She vigorously shook her head no . He pointed to a chair in the corner of the room . " Sit down , " he said . She stood pressed against the wall , riveted in place . He pushed his own glass away ; he did n't want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit . " She darted toward the chair aod fell into it , clasping her arms across her chest , trying to keep them from shaking . Ari took a chair from next to the bed and sat across from her . " What 's your name ? " " Saliha Maaruf . " The name was not familiar . Tsur , who had briefed him in detail on the inhabitants of the ghetto , had not mentioned a Maaruf family . Ari thought about the man he had seen in the lobby and the sudden arrest of Rachael ; there had to be some connection . Her arrest on the heels of her visit to the hotel was too much of a coincidence . Some extra sense inside him warned of a trap . " What happened to Rachael Khatib ? " he asked . The girl drew her legs tight together and seemed to collapse into herself . " What happened to Rachael ? " he repeated . " She was arrested . " " I know that . When and why ? " Saliha hesitated , then spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came here to the hotel , 120  | the soldiers took her and her father away . They do n't tell you why , when they 're coming back , if they 're coming back . " The girl broke into tears again . Ari took a handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to her . He wanted to believe this girl was legitimate , that she was a Jewess randomly selected to serve as Rachael 's substitute ; but he held back . If he gave the details of Operation Goshen to a Second Bureau agent he would soon find himself dangling from a rope in Marjeh Square . " How do you know Rachael came to this hotel ? " he asked . Saliha dried her eyes . " Everybody in the haret knew it . Jewish women , alone , never venture far from their apart ' ments . Rachael was taken to spend the night in a fancy hotel with a German , then she was arrested . It is not the type of thing that remains a secret . " Ari got up , retrieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of it in a gulp . " What did she say about the night she spent here ? " " Nothing . " " What did she say ? " he repeated roughly . " That you yelled , beat her , and made her . . . " The rest of her sentence dissolved into a torrent of tears . If this girl is working for the Syrians she 's a damn good actress , he thought to himself . " We assumed she did n't please you , " Saliha continued between choked sobs . " And that 's why you had her arrested . " Ari drained his glass and reached for the bottle , his hand shaking noticeably . Each question drove more strength out of him . He gripped the edge of the dresser to steady himself . He believed this girl was telling the truth  --  he wanted to believe it . Her anguish was too pervasive , the fear in her eyes , stark naked , real . She was terrified that she was next , that she would be 121  | beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did not have Rachael arrested , " he said softly . A puzzled look of uncertainty clouded her face ; she stopped crying . " Do you know Yakov Dahman ? " he asked quickly , mentioning the name of the recent escapee who had come to Kibbutz Revivim to speak with him . She started to answer , then stopped and lowered her eyes . " No , I never heard of him , " she said after a moment . He sensed that she was lying , that she was afraid to talk about a Jew who had escaped . Or , he asked himself , was that just what he wanted to believe ? Maybe she really was a Syrian agent who had never heard of Dahman ; that would explain why neither he nor Tsur had mentioned the Maaruf family  --  they did n't exist . Ari could not ignore the possibility that Rachael had been arrested to get her out of the way , so that the Second Bureau could plant this informer near him . He had to decide immediately : either he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be no delaying his decision . If he did not sleep with her and she really was a Jewess , he would lose the trust of the Jewish community , who at the moment already blamed him for the arrest of Rachael and her father . " Tell me about Ibrahim Sassoon , " Ari demanded , searching for some way to determine if she came from the Jewish quarter or the Second Bureau . " The Rabbi ? " Ari nodded . " What happened to him during the Yom Kippur War ? " She looked down at the floor . " He was tied to the gate of the Al-Frange Synagogue , arms spread out like a cross . Then he was beaten with palm branches . "  | " What about Rachael 's brother ? What do you know about him ? " " He does n't live in Damascus any more . " " Where does he live ? " " Israel , " she said . " What city ? " She mumbled something . " What city does he live in ? " Ari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he lives in Haifa . " " And his name ? " " Yair . " " And Eli Dahman , where does he live ? " Ari shouted . " In Israel , " she whimpered . " Do n't ask me what city . We just heard that he was smuggled across the Lebanese border . That 's all I know . " Ari paced the room . " Why did you lie to me before when I asked you if you knew him ? " " I was afraid , " she cried out , bursting into tears again . " It 's illegal for Jews to leave Syria . I could be put in jail just for knowing he 's in Israel . " " Recite the first paragraph of Israel 's Confession of Faith , " he demanded . She stared at him , a puzzled look of bewilderment on her face . " Do n't you know the Shema ? " he asked accusingly . " Va ahavta et adonai eloheha b'chol l'vavcha ... " " Enough , " he said . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refilled his glass . The bottle was half empty . I le knew that all he had succeeded in proving was that she was either a Jewess or a highly trained agent . And if the Second Bureau had sent somebody after him , it would not be a sloppily arranged affair . Ile touched the Chivas Regal to his lips , then stopped .  | He had surpassed his limit and he knew it . He set the Scotch down . " Why are you asking me all these questions ? " she asked , sitting back in the chair , pushing herself as far away from him as possible . He stared at her for a long time , hoping that something in her eyes would tip him in either direction . " Because I 'm an Israeli , " he said finally , wondering if he had just pronounced his death sentence . She looked at him in disbelief . " But Rachael said that you ... " " She really could not go around broadcasting that she had met with a representative of the Israeli government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I did n't know anything about it until tonight . " Suddenly a look of terror crossed her face . " You 're lying . You 're trying to trick me . I 'm going to be beaten and put in jail like Rachael . " He went to the dresser drawer , took out the chocolate bars , and handed them to her . They were soft ; the heat had melted them . " As a former Nazi and an Arab sympathizer I do n't have to trick you , I can take whatever I want . I have nothing to gain by pretending to be an Israeli . " She stared at him for a long time , the fear in her eyes fading . " Why are you here ? What does Rachael have to do with it ? " " We 'll talk in a few minutes . First , eat the chocolate ; it 's imported from Switzerland . " Ari moved out onto the narrow balcony and stared down at the noisy , neon-lit city  --  at the muddy Barada River with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tajhiz Secondary School directly across from the hotel . A warm , sandy breeze blew across Damascus from the El  | Hamad Desert . The wailing refrains of Fairuz , Syria 's favorite singer , rolled from a transistor radio on the balcony above him . Feeling the fear of isolation , Ari turned and went back inside . The chocolates still lay on the girl 's lap ; she had n't touched them . Lowering himself to the edge of the bed , he smiled at her . " Do you know Nissim Kimche ? " " Yes , " she said . " He 's the Headmaster of the Alliance school . He lives on Tel el Hadjara Street near the old Dandah Palace . " As she began to calm down he noticed her brown eyes , no longer fearful , were large and sad . He touched her hand . " You can eat the candy , there 's nothing in it . " She nodded and carefully began unwrapping the foil cover on one of the bars . He waited until she had bit off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachael was going to contact Headmaster Kimche and relay a message to him . I have no idea if she had time to do so . For now I have to assume that she did not . " The girl stared at him , silently chewing the chocolate . " I want you to take her place . Do you think you could tell the Headmaster something for me without anyone else over-hearing ? " " I do n't know . " She fingered the candy bars nervously and looked away . " I 'm afraid . " " I understand , but it 's important , otherwise I would n't ask . You might be saving the lives of some of your friends . And I promise , it wo n't be dangerous . " He held her hand in his . " Will you do it ? " A hard silence . Finally she nodded . " All right . " " Good . The message is short : just tell Nissim Kimche to arrange for his and Rabbi Sassoon 's children to be in the basement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's eleven days from now . You  | need n't be concerned about anything else . " " But what should I say if he asks why ? " " Do n't worry , he wo n't . " Her question made him uneasy ; details were the first thing a Syrian agent would want . " Is that all ? " She had expected something much more complicated . " Yes , except you are not to let anyone but Kimche know you met an Israeli agent ; everyone else is to think you were sexually molested . " She nodded , exhaling tensely . She looked worn out . " Are you tired ? " " Very " " All right , " he said , rising . " We 'll continue this in the morning . " His steps unsteady , he crossed the room and bolted the front door . He wanted no uninvited intruders . " I 'll sleep in the small bed . You can stay here . " " Thank you , " she said , as he closed the adjoining room door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of the narrow bed , then stretched out . The tiredness seemed to explode within him . The thoughts inside his head were jumbled , confused . He knew he had to work things out , grapple with his uncertainties , decide what to do next . But the ability to fit a pattern over the last days ' events eluded him . Suddenly he wondered if Karl Richtman had n't been right in Frankfurt ; maybe he was too tired . He closed his eyes and the Scotch spun inside his head . He fell asleep wondering if Saliha worked for Sarraj , hoping she was legitimate , and that a fate similar to Rachael 's did not await her departure from the hotel . There was a knocking on the bedroom door . Ari opened one eye just enough to discern that it was morning , then let himself sink deeper into the mattress . The  | knocking grew louder . He strained to wake up , sweating in his sleep . The last weeks had exhausted him , but he 'd be fine as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he forced himself into full consciousness . Realizing to his dismay that he was fully clothed , he wiped his forehead on the pillow case and unbuttoned his shirt , allowing the air to Row against his damp collar . The tapping on his door continued . He slipped on his shoes and thought about the girl who was trying to rouse him , hoping he had done the right thing in trusting her . He opened the door . " The phone was ringing and I thought it might be important , " she said self-consciously . " But it 's stopped now. , , Ari affected a smile in an attempt to calm her . " What do you want me to do ? " Ari looked at her bed ; the covers were tangled and draped half over the floor . She had n't spent a peaceful night either . " If you do n't mind , you could make the bed in the small room , " he said . " I 'm going to take a shower . I 'll be right back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteered . " No , just do the one . " She nodded and hurried past him into the adjacent bedroom . He moved toward the window . Taking the Chivas Regal from the dresser , he held it up to the morning light and looked through the amber bottle . The dark convexity of the glass shone out of its lip . There was something warm and comforting about the color amber . Scotch fills the meek with courage , provides the lonely with a friend , and helps the bored bide time . Ari shook the bottle vigorously , watching the bubbles form on the liquid 's surface , then disappear a second later . Scotch also distorts one 's judgment , destroys the body , and drowns reality in a false sense of well-being . People who drink because they ca n't cope  | with life soon find they ca n't cope with alcohol . He shook the bottle again , trying to keep the bubbles from disappearing , but he could n't , the same way he could n't seem to keep his world from disintegrating around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way to the bathroom , still clutching the Scotch . He looked into the mirror , not liking what he saw . His hair was matted against his skull , crease lines ringed his eyes , and he needed a shave . He screwed the cap off the Chivas Regal , brought the lip of the bottle to his nose , and inhaled . The odor stung the inside of his nostrils . He hesitated for a moment , then poured the Scotch down the drain . Ari emerged from the shower with a fresh sense of vigor and determination . He dressed quickly and crossed into the main room , where Saliha sat waiting in the same chair she had occupied the night before . " Did you sleep well ? " he asked . She shook her head . " I was up most of the night . " " I 'm sorry . " He moved to the phone on the nightstand and smiled at her . " Do n't worry . Everything 's all right . You 'll be home in a little while . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number , assuming he was not delivering their agent back to them . AR ! LAY on the bed , tangled in thought when the phone rang . " Monsieur Hoffmann , this is the bell captain . Your friend the American photographer has just arrived in the hotel . " Ari sat up excitedly and ground his cigarette into the bedside ashtray . " Is Miss Johnson in her room now ? " " She just stepped into the elevator . " " Thank you very much . " Ari hung up and hurried toward the door . When he reached her room he entered without knocking . " You , " she said , turning back from the window where she stood staring out at the city . " How did you know I was back ? " Irritation was evident in her voice . " Either I come down here every hour or I bribed the bell captain . " " What did it cost you ? " " Ten pounds . " " You could have gotten a decent whore for that price , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wasted your money , because you 're finished climbing into my bed . Go back to your  | friend the bell captain . I 'm sure for another ten pounds he can find you a consenting female . Maybe you can get somebody else right here in the hotel , since you 're used to not having to go too far . " " Why did you leave for Aleppo without saying anything ? " he asked , ignoring her sarcasm . " I had to get away from you . " " Because I 'm a former Nazi ? " She turned and moved toward the window without answering . " As an American you find Nazis utterly despicable ? " " Yes , " she said , facing him . " As an American and as a Jew . " " I 'm still the same man you met before you knew . " " What difference does that make ? " " What if I tell you I was in charge of organizing work useful for the war effort , that I did n't have anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do to stop them ? You were right there and you did nothing  --  that 's even worse . " She took a pack of cigarettes off the end table and nervously lit one . " You 're a murderer by virtue of your silence . " Feeling her slipping away , he groped in the nothingness . There had to be a way without telling her the truth . But he found none . " Kim , " he pleaded , at a loss for words . " Stay . " " Why ? What am I ? A balm to assuage your guilty conscience ? The token Jew who 's somehow different from the vermin you exterminated ? Why do you want me ? I thought Nazis believed they would be polluted if they slept with anyone with Jewish blood . " Anger cut through her voice . " Did n't Hitler enact some law to protect you from the poison secreted by our genitals ? " " To me you 're a person , not a Jew . " " In other words , a Jew 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if he were some clay object she was sticking her thumbs into , but on closer inspection he saw the thumbprints were his own . " I do n't hate Jews , " he said . Nervously she knocked the ash from the tip of her cigarette . " I do n't understand . How can a Nazi not hate Jews ? It 's impossible . It does n't make sense . " She paused for a moment . " That is , unless ... your behavior ... I told you my mother was Jewish that first night in Jerusalem . It did n't matter . You still continued to see me . " She crushed out her cigarette and looked at him . " You 're not really a Nazi , are you ? " Ari 's cheeks whitened . He was making a mistake and he knew it ; but something in his subconscious told him he could trust her , that if need be he could tell her everything . Two intruders in a hostile land , their fates were intertwined , dependent on each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to remain anonymous . " I ca n't tell you who I am , " he said , dropping into the chair by the bed . " Anything I say would only endanger you . " " How ? I do n't understand . You said that before  --  it scares me . " " Kim , just be patient . In a little while I 'll be able to leave here , then I 'll explain everything . " " Why ca n't you at least tell me who you are and what you 're doing in Damascus ? " " I just ca n't ! " he shouted . Angry at himself he moved onto the bed next to her and spoke in a gentle voice . " I 'll be finished here in ten days . Trust me until then , please , it 'll be the best for both of us . " She kicked at the fringes hanging from the edges of the bedspread . " I want to , but . . . " " All I 'm asking you to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hesitated . " Please . " She stared out the open window , then dropped her gaze to the floor . " I went to Aleppo to work you out of my system , but I could n't . I shot ten rolls of film but every time I looked through the viewfinder I kept seeing your face . " She smiled . " Even when the lens cap was on . I did n't want to believe you were a Nazi . I tried to block it out of my mind , to convince myself that the concentration camps were a long time ago , that you could not have been part of . . . " He kissed her , toppling the two of them over . Halfheartedly she struggled against him , pushing his hand away as he reached for the buttons on her blouse . " Do n't . It 's the middle of the afternoon . " " I noticed . " She laughed and let him pull the soft material away from her body . Afterward he lay back , thinking about the mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turning on his side , he rested his head against her shoulder . " Is Hans Hoffmann your real name ? " she asked , breaking the stillness . " No , " he said . " What is it ? " Silence . " I wo n't tell anybody . You can trust me . " " I know that . " " Why are you in Damascus ? " " I ca n't tell you . " " Why not ? " she said , suddenly angry . " Is screwing me all you care about ? " " If a body was all I wanted I would pay for it . " " Well , what do you expect me to do ; just jump into  | bed with you on demand , not knowing who you are or even what your name is  --  and then talk about the weather afterward ? " " When my work 's finished here . . . " " What work ? What are you ? Some underworld figure ? A smuggler ? A dope dealer ? An assassin ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it matter if I 'm any of those things  --  or all of them ? " " Yes , no . I do n't know . Oh God , why ca n't we just get out of here . " She kicked at the blankets . " So do n't tell me , do n't tell me anything . " She slammed her head into the pillow . He moved toward the side of the bed and stepped on the floor . " Just be patient . After the twenty-second I 'll be able to tell you everything . " She stretched her hand toward him . " Do n't leave yet . " " I have to . " " More secret business ? " " Yes , " he nodded , dressing quickly . " Will you be back early ? " " I do n't know , maybe . I 'll call you . " He stretched across the bed to kiss her good-bye but as he came near she turned away . After Moslem troops wrestled control of Damascus from the Byzantine Empire in 635 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city farthest from the west winds and fresh waters of Lebanon . Ari thought about this as he squeezed through a crowd of veiled women and sweaty men on the Street Called Straight . Heading east toward the Bab Touma , the Christian quarter , he turned the corner and neared a sherbet seller . Wearing red and white striped robes , with brass ewers strapped to his chest and bowls clicking , the 133  | man approached , urging him to " eat the sweet fruits of Damascus and make love five times a day . " Ari shook his head no , and increased his gait , skirting around two dogs fighting over a mutton bone in the narrow street . The Bab Touma , crushed and confused , its streets wrapped in sudden belts of din and silence , struck Ari as being medieval . The few new houses he spotted seemed to be wedged in against the jumbled architecture of other generations . Decorated coffee tables , shesh-besh boards , mother-of-pearl inlaid boxes , and polygonal stools called kursi spilled onto the sidewalk from open shops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkish warehouse , once filled with bales of Chinese and Indian silk . Now , empty oil drums lined its crumbling walls . As he proceeded north up Dja Afar Street in the direction of the Church of Saint Ananias the lane twisted and narrowed , winding past closed doors . From around a curve in the alley a group of ragged boys emerged , their pajamalike shirts dirty and torn . Realizing from his dress and coloring that Ari was a foreigner , they clustered around him chanting : " Anania ! Anania ! " in unison . He shook his head , indicating that he was not interested in visiting the church . But they insisted , their cry reminiscent of the bleating of sheep . Ari dug into his pocket , withdrew a handful of coins , and flung them back behind him . The gleeful boys scurried after the money , squealing and shouting as they fought each other for the piasters . Ari hurried out of the alley and through the ancient Roman arch from whose base Azaryeh Street began ? certain now that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a flight of stairs to the dark Cafe Shaam . Since Ottoman rule the kahwa has been an accepted meeting place for student groups , conspiring merchants , army officers , and gov-134  | ernment officials . In fact the city 's coffee houses are so closely linked with political factions , according to the affiliations of their customers , that the police and Internal Security Service mapped and classified them , invariably asking suspects which ones they patronized . Ari stood at the entrance for a while waiting for his eyes to adjust to the lack of light . Kibbutz Revivim 's scale model of Damascus was exact ; Ari had found the cafe without difficulty . Stepping inside , he glanced at the luminous dial on his watch . It read 5:30 ; he was half an hour early . As his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness he made out the shadowy figures of men seated at low tables , playing shesh-besh , and sucking on glowing nargilehs . The heavy aromas of tobacco and hashish hung in the air . Ari moved across the room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the center of the table was a nargileh . He removed the cover and dumped a small quantity of French Gitanes Blend into the metal bowl at the top of the pipe . Soon a special waiter approached and placed a chunk of burning coal over the tobacco . After snapping the lid back on Ari brought the long snakelike tube to his mouth and inhaled . The water in the glass jar at the base of the nargileh bubbled as the smoke was drawn through it , cooled , and sucked into his mouth . After a while a different waiter moved near and asked if he would like something to eat . Ari ordered salted olives , red peppers , a tray of sweetmeats , and a pot of mint tea . In the event Lieutenant Barkai was late , he would wait . Ari assumed that Barkai had crossed safely into Syria . He was supposed to have arrived early today . Carrying a forged Moroccan passport , the French- and Arabic-speaking lieutenant should have had no trouble entering the country . While he waited Ari nibbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the tea steep . 135  | Waiting was the fundamental task of intelligence agents . Anyone could be trained to kill or blow up buildings . But the ability to wait for hours , days , or weeks if need be , without becoming tense , without betraying that you indeed were engaged in an assignment  --  such patience could not be taught . It had to exist in a person . Ari allowed the thoughts to ripple through him . Noticing the total absence of women in the cafe , he mused about the anomalies of Moslem Syria . Fifty years ago polygamy and concubines had flourished in Damascus and a generation before that a woman appearing on the streets unveiled was automatically assumed to be a prostitute and could have been slain by any male passerby without fear of retribution . Even now many women would not talk to a man openly , or dare meet him ; for such behavior could easily taint their reputations . A woman who has been touched by another man is often considered unacceptable by prospective suitors . On the eve of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks him to stab her should she not prove a virgin . Even after marriage most Syrian women are relegated to a lowly status . They can not leave their homes without their husband 's permission and rarely speak with his friends , or for that matter , converse with their own spouses in public . Syrian men never talk about their wives and consider it an insult to be asked about them . Because of the distance they must keep from women , many males find release from otherwise unsatisfiable pressures in homosexuality . In the far corner of the room two young men sat close together , one 's hands reaching under the other 's loose robes . Behind the counter of the coffee house the radio blared the high-pitched songs of Om Kalthoum , the beloved Egyptian singer whose funeral in Cairo in 1975 drew crowds as large as , and causing as much damage as , 136  | the mourners who rampaged through the Egyptian capital following the interment of Nasser five years earlier . After a while Ari 's thoughts drifted to Kim . He wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service . In any event , he swore that he would not let this assignment ruin his relationship with her . Sweeping the room with his eyes , he checked to make sure that Barkai was not seated at one of the low tables . Then he asked the waiter for a shesh-besh set and began playing against himself . The blacks were ahead of the whites three games to one when Ari poured out the last of the tea . He slowly took one sip from the small porcelain cup at a time . The liquid left an unpleasant aftertaste in his mouth . It was lukewarm and poorly strained . The hours ground into each other then blew away . Two men at a neighboring table , who wore styleless black suits and flowing keffiyehs tied with gold ropes , offered Ari some hashish to mix with his tobacco . He smiled at them , graciously declined , then looked at his watch and followed the second hand around the dial . The calender date read the twelfth , the day the Colonel had set for the first meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another pot of tea Ari took up the small dice and rolled , beginning game five of the blacks against the whites . A double six came up and the blacks surged out ahead again . He wondered if the results of the game were n't somehow symbolic . It was a little after nine when Ari first allowed himself to realize that Barkai probably was n't coming . By ten thirty he was sure of it . But there was always a chance the lieutenant had been delayed and would still show . So Ari tossed the dice , relit the pipe , and waited . The water at the bottom of the nargileh was warm now , and it did little to cool the harsh tobacco . Ari let the tube drop from his 137  | mouth and focused his concentration on the game . When the music blaring through the cafe was interrupted for the last and final news report of the night at midnight , he stood slowly , stretched , and headed for the door . Outside he leaned against the stone wall of the building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculously appear . The minute turned into two , then five . Ari walked up the steps to the street and stopped , listening hard to what he thought was the sound of approaching footsteps  --  but in reality was the creation of his own imagination . He started to walk under the moonless sky . The combination of the darkness of the streets , the arches over them , and the narrowness between the walls was a bit unnerving . From a nearby passageway he heard the howl of a wolf-dog , followed by rasping and swishing sounds as the animal dragged refuse along the gutter . Wild dogs , long-muzzled like wolves , slept in the fields and ruins during the day , then glided into the old city at night , after the town was silent . Suddenly a pack of them , snarling and yelping , rushed up and attacked the first dog . The barking , echoing down the dark alleys , sent a shiver through Ari . He saw nothing . He only heard the noise : the horrible howling , the snapping , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-pitched wail . Then its throat was ripped open and silenced . Ari hurried through the night , the sounds of the dogs fading behind him . A fall-back meeting with Barkai had been arranged for the eighteenth at noon . If he was not contacted at the hotel he would have to wait until then .  | FRANZ LUDIN 'S DRIVER picked Art up at the New Ommayad and drove toward the western edge of the city , over the Nabek Bridge and into the fashionable Jisr district . Turning into Ibrahim Mansour Street , they passed the honey-colored minaret of the Raoudah Mosque spiII raling into the sky directly across from the walled Italian I Embassy , which had handled diplomatic relations with the United States until President Assad reestablished ties with America in 1974 . Soon the Czech Skoda stopped in front of a white stone villa at 14 Ataa el-Aiyouby Street , between the Banque de Syrie d'Outre-Mer and a florist shop . Ari got out and passed through a fountain courtyard into an arcade with vines climbing through the latticework . Hearing his approaching footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest in . Ari bowed with Prussian correctness . " I 've been looking forward to this evening . " With trepidation , he might have added . For if Rudolf Heinneman was well enough to attend the party , and his suspicions were roused by not remembering an Untersturmfiihrer Hans Hoffmann , Operation Goshen would meet an abrupt end  --  and Ari 's life with it . Ludin led him through the classically Syrian house whose rooms , opening into two courtyards , were 139  | not linked together . As they stepped outside into the iwan the three men standing there stopped talking . A quick glance informed Ari that though they were all German emigres , Heinneman was not among them . " Kameraden , I would like to introduce SS Untersturmfiihrer Hans Hoffmann . " Ari smacked his heels together and remained at attention as the three men approached . " Herr Hoffmann , may I introduce Colonel Ludwig Streicher , former instructor in military tactics at the Berlin War Academy , presently adviser to the Syrian army ; my associate from Goebbels 's propaganda ministry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolff . " The three men knocked the leather of their shoes together , each bowing stiffly as he was introduced . Following the war these Nazis , along with an estimated one hundred former Reich officials still living in Damascus , were actively recruited as military advisers by the Arab Wehrmacht Lieutenant Colonel Akhram Tabassa . Some , contacted in Germany and Austria by former Nazis carrying Syrian passports , underwent a crash course in Arabic , then proceeded to Rome and Geneva where clandestine processing stations set up in the Syrian legations supplied them with the papers necessary for travel to the Middle East . Others , fugitives contracted by the French and Spanish foreign legions to fight in Indochina , were sold to the Syrians for $500 apiece , smuggled through the French zone in Germany under the guise of legionnaires , and delivered for embarkation to ports in Italy and Turkey . The higher-ranking German officers , watched over by the paternal eye of SS Hauptsturmfiihrer Rostal , who was in charge of the ODESSA 's European branch , gathered in Augsburg where they were given forged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in newspaper delivery trucks 140  | to Lindau on Lake Constance , where Austrian women and children , hired to pose as their relatives , accompanied them to St. Gall in Switzerland . Major Gunther von Hardenberg , stationed in Beirut , met each plane from Geneva . His association for Christian German War Refugees assigned the Nazis to units in the Syrian army and helped them on their last lap to Damascus . Ludin , Streicher , Wolff , and Brunner had all been passengers on Hauptsturmfiihrer Rostal 's underground railroad . As Ludin poured a round of drinks Ludwig Streicher approached Ari , glass in hand . " When we get together like this it reminds me how much I miss Germany . Where did you serve during the war ? " " Dachau . " Streicher turned to their host . " It 's a pity Heinneman could n't be here . I 'm sure he would have enjoyed speaking to Herr Hoffmann . " Ari began to relax  --  he had escaped the Butcher of Dachau , again . Now , with the threat to his cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had struck a gold mine of high-ranking Nazi officers . He decided that upon returning to the hotel he would hide a coded request for further instructions in one of the backgammon sets and send it to Frankfurt . Maybe the Colonel would give him permission to liquidate Ludin and the others , if he could figure out a way to do it without jeopardizing his principal assignment . That is , if he heard from the Colonel . Though he had tried to put it out of his mind , the fact that Barkai had not shown up worried him  --  it worried him a lot . " Heinneman has not been feeling well , " Ludin said . " But he promised to try and join us for a little while later in the evening . " The muscles inside Ari 's stomach tightened . He was not out of danger yet . 141  | " Splendid , " Eichmann 's thin , balding aide , Heinrich Wolff , said . " Now let 's get our guest a drink and have him tell us about the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . Wolff took Ari by the arm and led him to a low , mother-of-pearl table serving as an outdoor bar . " The Israelis and West Germans look for me everywhere , " he said . " They accuse me , quite wrongly , of having killed Jews during the war . Fortunately , I 'm comparatively undisturbed in Damascus and allowed to earn a respectable living here . " Ari took the Scoresby Scotch the well-known fugitive offered him . A member of Eichmann 's staff in Bureau IVB 4a , Heinrich Wolff had been responsible for the deportation of Jews from Greece , France , Slovakia , and Austria to extermination camps in Poland . " Why did you say comparatively undisturbed ? " Wolff glanced at Streicher and sipped his drink . " Earlier this year we caught an Israeli spy masquerading as a Syrian banker with connections to the Krupp arms fortune in Germany . He turned out to be an Iraqi Jew . Spoke Arabic with a perfect Syrian accent , I 'm told . Ludwig knew him . " " What happened ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover story , did some checking , and discovered he was a fraud , " Wolff said . " And they arrested him ? " " Yes . Lucky thing too . He would have escaped , but evidently his people did n't show at the rendezvous point . They left him stranded . " " It was very strange , " Brunner added . " Some heads must have rolled in Tel Aviv over that one . We 're certain he sent a distress signal to Cyprus with the transmitter we found destroyed in his apartment . The Israeli 's liaison officer must have been away from his post . " 142  | Ari staggered back , fighting to keep his composure . Dov must have signaled for help the weekend he was in Kyrenia with Michelle . He was responsible for the ordeal the boy was undergoing . Nobody had told him ! " You 've suddenly turned white , " Brunner said . " What 's wrong ? " " Nothing , nothing , " Ari answered quickly , understanding now why the Colonel had brought him home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A piece of ice got caught in my throat . It 's passed . I 'm fine now . " He picked up his glass , took a long drink , then looked at Brunner . " Is this Israeli spy still alive ? " " We do n't know . The Second Bureau chief , Suleiman Sarraj , has kept the details surrounding his interrogation very quiet . " " Has he made him talk ? " " We have no idea . As I said , Sarraj has been tightlipped about the whole thing . " Ari frowned and turned toward the tall , powerfully built Streicher . " This could have been dangerous for all of us . Heinrich said you spoke to him . Were you able to find out what the Israeli was doing here ? " " No . " " But he must have said something that gave you a clue to the purpose of his mission . " " I 'd rather not discuss the incident , " Streicher said . Ludin stepped between his two guests . " Excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He took Ari by the arm . " And let us discuss more pleasant matters inside . Come , I want to show you the case of Weingut Erath Liebfraumilch that just arrived from Maikarnmer . Select a bottle for us to drink with our food . " As they settled into the den after the meal Ari glanced 143  | at his watch . He felt that after half an hour or so he could claim he was n't feeling well , make his apologies , then scurry back to the hotel without focusing suspicion on himself or insulting his host . He should leave as soon as possible , lest Heinneman show up and betray him as an imposter . Fate and Heinneman 's health had given him a temporary reprieve , but now it was up to Ari to avail himself of it . He 'd press Ludin for details about Dov 's capture and interrogation at a later date . Just then the doorbell rang . The sound flushed fear into his bloodstream . A few moments later Ludin 's Arab servant led an elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat as if a noose had been placed around his neck . It was Heinneman . Ari would have recognized him anywhere , at any time . Though he was bent now and he used a cane to steady himself , the man was the same . The eyes had n't changed , the monocle was still there , and so was the vein that stretched across his forehead . " Rudolf , come sit down and let me reacquaint you with an old komerad . Herr Heinneman , SS Untersturmfiihrer Hans Hoffmann of Dachau Camp . " Ari leapt to his feet and saluted Heinneman , shouting , " Jawohl , Herr Hauptsturmfiihrer . " " You were at Dachau ? " Heinneman asked , lowering himself slowly to the couch . " Yes , " Ari said . " Hoffmann , Hoffmann . I do n't seem to remember the name . " " We only met once or twice . " As Ari sat on the couch , Heinneman squinted , and peered at him through his monocle . " Your face looks vaguely familiar  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer . " " That 's strange , " Wehrmacht Colonel Streicher said . " How long were you at Dachau , Herr Hoffmann ? " Ari fought an inner battle , struggling against the tendency to simply allow himself to be taken , to end it all : the masquerade , the game , the isolation . " Two years , " he said . " It seems very odd that Rudolf does not remember you. , , Ari turned toward Heinneman . He could not understand why he and the other inmates had never pounced on this animal and beaten the life out of him with a rock , a board , or a shovel . There had been more than ample opportunity . Suddenly Ari wanted to do it now , before Streicher closed in on him . He looked at Heinneman 's neck ; he was certain he could snap it and be out the front door before Streicher , Ludin , and the other two recovered from the shock . There would be no possibility of escape , but at least .. . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , facing Heinneman . " My detachment was responsible for the organization of the camp labor komniando . Since I was of insignificant rank possibly you did not notice me , but I definitely remember you . You were a model of excellence that we younger men attempted to imitate . " There was no officer so well liked , so respected at Dachau . Your ruthless handling of the prisoners in punishment block number 11 was spoken of throughout the camp . When you passed the pathetic creatures shivered in fear . I remember one particular incident when a Jew was lying in the dirt and would n't get up as you ordered ; you pointed a pistol at his head and made him polish your boots by licking them and then wiping the spittle off with his beard . When he 145  | finished you emptied your gun into his temple , splattering his head over the ground . Then you made two young Jews carry the body to the crematorium . " Heinneman smiled at the recollection . " Of course , I remember the day clearly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my German shepherd , had come down with a cold and I was concerned about her . The Jew had interrupted my thoughts . Funny you should remind me of that morning  --  I have n't thought about Bitta in years . " Heinneman drifted back to the memory of his dog , then slowly forced his way into the present . " What made you recall that incident ? " " I was standing behind the barracks , laughing . The Jew rubbing your boot with his chin just struck me as being very funny . I 've always remembered it . " Ari remembered that particular killing not because Iil he 'd stood to the side laughing , but because he had been one of the two boys ordered to carry the corpse to the ovens . While holding the frail body by the shoulders , the Jew 's brains had dripped over his hands and onto his clothes . " In which part of the camp did you live ? " Heinneman asked . " I was in barracks three near the little bridge and flower garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk there after a long , tiring day . " Streicher lit a cigarette , and blew the match out as he exhaled . He held the cigarette from underneath with the tips of his thumb and index finger , the way Germans do . " Rudolf , do you remember Herr Hoffmann now ? " Streicher asked . Heinneman tapped his cane impatiently on the floor . Though technically Colonel Streicher held a higher rank than the ailing Hauptsturmfdhrer , the SS officer pri-146  | vately held all Wehrmacht officers in contempt , blaming them for the demise of the Third Reich . " I 'm an old man , " he said , letting his monocle fall from his eye . " And not so foolish as to believe that my memory does not fail me . Just because I can not remember one of the komeraden after more than a quarter of a century , there is no reason to suspect anything beyond the simple fact that I am becoming senile . " He took his cane and lightly struck Streicher on the knee . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Fiihrer was with us . " Ludin laughed , trying to chip away at the tension that blanketed the room . Ari and the other Nazis joined him . Whether Streicher was satisfied enough not to press his inquiries further , Ari did n't know . But the rest of the evening passed in trivial conversation . If Streicher was still suspicious of him , he kept it to himself . Back in his room in the hotel , Ari locked and bolted the door , then collapsed on the bed , shaking . 147  | IN THE MORNING , several hours before his second scheduled attempt to contact Lieutenant Barkai , Ari plodded through the marketplace on the Street Called Straight , stepping around puddles of mud covered over , unsuccessfully , by newspaper . The vegetable bazaar was cluttered with stalls piled high with tomatoes , peppers , onions , cabbages , and eggplants . Women from the al-Ghutah orchards , dressed in black and ultramarine cotton , their hair and necks veiled , their eyes outlined with kohl in emulation of the gazelle , crowded between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were easily distinguished from the women of the desert region near Hijaneh who wore bright yellows and pinks , their foreheads circled by a series of gold discs . Passing a man sitting on a straw stool eating stuffed vine leaves sunk in goat 's milk , Ari increased his gait , trying to escape the stench of rotting food trapped in the market by the corrugated iron roof overhead . Soon he reached the Roman arch on Bab Sharki Street just outside the Haret al Yahoud . He skirted around the soldiers lounging on the corner of el-Amine and Tel el-Hadjara streets , casting a casual glance in their direction . If a person acts at ease in a 148  | given place , those observing hirn will probably assume he belongs there . Anyway it seemed everyone was allowed fire passage in and out of the haret . Ari wiped the sweat off his brow with his shirt sleeve . Though it was the middle of September the eastern winds continued to blow in front the desert , daily depositing a thin layer of sand over the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mornings and nights were n't much cooler . At moved toward Rachael 's apartment  --  if anyone became suspicious he could always explain his presence there with lascivious innuendoes . An uneasiness had plagued him ever since Saliha 's unexpected appearance in his room . Rachael 's being arrested immediately after spending the night in his hotel was too much of a coincidence ; and if there was one thing his years in the Service had taught him , it was that most coincidences were humanly engineered . If so , Ari wanted to know by whom , end why . The sound of a boy screaming invaded his thoughts , breaking them off fractured , incomplete . The cry for help came from an alley just ahead of him , growing in tensity as it cut through the still Jewish ghetto . At the and of the screaming , wooden shutters on both sides of the street slammed shut . Trembling , the Jews attempted to ignore the pained plea forcing itself into their homes from the street below . But yanking the shutters closed offered no escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , streaming into the hearts whole families who sat numb , silent  --  wondering who would be next . Weeks , months , years ago , there had en a few who tried to fight back . They were now dead , along with their families , friends , and sometimes even their neighbors . Ari hurried toward the source of the screaming , trying 149  | not to run , not to appear too concerned . Turning into the alley , he stopped abruptly . The stench of burned flesh struck his nostrils . His mouth went dry and his eyes misted . Instinctively he turned away , the shrieking ricocheting inside his head . A young boy maybe sixteen or seventeen approached him , speaking in Arabic . Ari spun around and stared back to where a group of youths held a lean , scrawny-looking boy to the ground . A trash fire burned in the middle of the alley . One of the boys held a pointed stick over the glowing embers , the tip a fiery red . Blood and singed membrane dripped down the pinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Now the youthful band , mercifully deciding to spare the other eye , was busy burning a Star of David into the screaming victim 's chest . But the lines were jagged  --  the little Jew had squirmed , refusing to be held still . His brown skin was charred black and bloody , his chest burned repeatedly in an attempt to straighten out the lines of the six-pointed figure . Though Ari did n't respond , the boy who approached him kept talking . The flow of Arabic fell unintelligibly on his ears , that is except for the repeated use of the word Yahoud . " I do n't speak Arabic , " Ari said , gaining control of the anger churning inside him . He easily could have slammed into the crowd of boys , picked up the little Jew , and taken him to a nearby apartment building . But he dared not move or show any interest at all . " He 's a Jew , " the young Arab said , switching to French . " We caught him stealing food from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our land , but they enter our homes and take the bread off our tables . " The boy spat on the ground . Ari hoped they would not adhere to the Koranic injunction , followed literally in Saudi Arabia and Libya , 150  | that demanded a thief 's hand be chopped off as punishment for stealing . Suddenly the child 's screaming stopped . He had passed out . The boys let go of him and dropped their sticks ; evidently it was no fun poking at an unconscious body . * Ari looked at the young Arab and spoke softly . " He 's been taught a lesson . The Jew will not be so foolish as to attempt to take your food again . " The boy smiled , baring white teeth . Ari turned and walked back to the street , the smell of burned flesh lingering in his nostrils . The haret was deserted and quiet . While Jews in other parts of the world gathered to protest their persecution , here there was only waiting , a treading on time ; not life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark stairs inside a building at 21 El Boustana Street . He held onto the rail because the wood underneath his feet swayed with his every step . As he slowly inched his way toward the third floor , the stairwell grew darker . There were no windows , no light . " Ouch , " he said suddenly . A splinter from the rough railing had jabbed his finggrs. lie pulled it out and sucked at the tiny wound . In the dark he could n't see if he had gotten the sliver all out or not . The third-floor corridor carpet was faded and worn . The hallway itself was dark , musky , and heavy with the odor of stale air . It brought a chill to his bones , despite the heat . Ari knocked lightly on number seventeen and waited . There was no answer . He banged harder . Nobody came to the door , but he thought he made out a faint noise inside the apartment . He turned the handle and pushed . It would n't budge  --  the door was locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally he heard the sounds of approaching footsteps . A matronly woman opened the door . She was short 151  | and wrinkled , with mousy brown hair pinned back in a braided bun . " Madame Khatib ? " She nodded feebly , too tired to use words . " I just want to ask about Rachael . " She slammed the door shut ; but An caught his foot at the base , wedged it there , and forced his way inside . Hate lodged in her small eyes . " Have n't you done enough ? You 've taken my husband away and destroyed my daughter . Ca n't you leave her alone . What can you possibly want with her now ? " She shot a glance toward the closed door in the far corner of the room . Ari followed her gaze and moved across the apartment . " No ! " she shouted , clutching at his sleeve . " Do n't take her away again . Do n't do this to me . " A stream of tears ran down her cheeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , " he said , trying to reassure Madame Khatib . " I 'm not going to hurt her or take her away . I have n't touched her . I would n't touch her . You must believe me . " She stood there : frail , vulnerable , confused . The tears continued to roll down her cheeks . Ari opened the door to the tiny bedroom . Rachael sat looking out the window , her back facing him . She did n't move when he entered . " Rachael , " he whispered softly . No response . Ari stood in place . " Rachael , " he called louder . His voice echoed hollowly off the walls . Her mother pushed past him , grabbed the chair and turned it around . Rachael stared through them , offering no sign of recognition . Ari bent near her . " Rachael , can you hear me ? " She did n't blink . He rose , a look of horror impressed on his face . The 152  | fury cutting through him was matched only by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Ever since they brought her back . " " When was that ? " " Two days ago . " " What do the doctors say ? " " They ca n't find anything physically wrong with her . It 's her mind . She 's been . . . " Her voice broke ; she could n't go on . " What did they do to her ? " he shouted , venting his misplaced anger on Madame Khatib . " I do n't know . A neighbor found her wandering in the street . He brought her up . She has n't spoken a word since . " Rachael continued to stare at them , a glazed look of catatonia in her eyes . Ari took the girl 's head and held it against his chest . It was like touching a mannequin ; she did n't respond , she just allowed herself to be moved . He stroked her ( lark hair , and looked out the window , wanting to cry and not wanting to cry at the same time . Her visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have . Bending down , he looked into her vacant eyes , then brought his lips to her check . It was dangerous for him to be here , w have anything to do with her when it was obvious he could no longer claim his intentions toward this girl were purely carnal . " I have to go , " he said , turning to Madame Khatib . " If anyone asks , I came here intending to rape your daughter . That 's important . Do you understand ? " He drilled a hard glare at her . She nodded . Though confused , she decided if questioned she would comply with his request . The way this foreigner held Rachael convinced her to trust him . Abruptly Ari hurried into the main room . He could n't 153  | bear to be near the girl ; every second in her presence was a reminder that she 'd probably been arrested because of him . Mrs. Khatib followed . " Will she get better ? " she asked tearfully , begging for a comforting reply . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stopped . " Remember , if anyone asks , I came to rape her . " She nodded . He placed his hand on the doorknob , hesitated , then turned back . " Do you know Saliha Maaruf ? She says she 's a friend of Rachael 's . " " Saliha Maaruf . " She paused for a moment , then shook her head . " I do n't remember Rachael ever mentioning her . " " Are you sure ? " Madame Khatib nodded . Ari arrived at the Cafe Teyrouzi in the northern Chouhada district , across from the Syrian Parliament , forty-five minutes early . Standing in the entranceway , he pushed his shoulder against the wood casing , trying to support what little energy he had left . The incident in the alley , the man in the lobby , and the arrest of Rachael all suggested that the Syrians were onto him . And now there was the possibility that Saliha was a Second Bureau agent , that he 'd blown Operation Goshen . His mouth was dry . He felt the beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After glancing around the room , he settled into a corner table to wait for Lieutenant Barkai . The cafe was located in a better area of town than the one in which the two Israelis had first attempted to rendezvous ; it was essential that Ari move around , that no pattern be as-  | cribed to his activities . The Colonel had chosen Teyrouzi for no reason other than it had little in common with Cafe Shaam in the Christian quarter . Teyrouzi , large and well illuminated , with formica tables and white plaster walls lined with photographs of famous Arab personalities , was a particular favorite of Damascus 's intellectual elite . Ari ordered sweet coffee and a plate of shakshouka , vegetables fried in spiced tomato sauce . When the food arrived he ate slowly , occasionally glancing around the room . Barkai would show this time , Ari told himself as he chewed on a piece of makrouk bread . He was sure of it . If not , the Mossad would send somebody else or somehow get in touch with him . By now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sent in the specially packaged backgammon set . Without radio communication all he could do was wait for the Colonel 's next move . He was sure it would be made this afternoon . It had to be  --  time was running out . The children were to be lowered into Damascus 's sewer system in four days . There could be no delay : either Operation Goshen was executed according to the preset timetable or the children had to be abandoned . Those were his orders . Soon Ari ordered a second cup of thick Turkish coffee . Barkai was late again . Ari looked at his watch  --  the second hand crawled unceasingly across the white dial . He flipped the band so that the face pointed away from him and he could n't see what time it was . A simple crutch , but an effective one . The minutes slowly fell away . Ari was not a particularly philosophical man and he resisted the opportunity to pass the time by pondering such abstract notions as man 's fate and the reasons for the suffering he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last three weeks  | over and over in his mind , searching for something he could not put his finger on  --  the answer to a question he was yet unable to formulate . If Barkai did n't turn up he did n't know what he would do . Getting the children out of the ghetto was futile if the lieutenant was not prepared to transfer the youngsters to the boat that would take them to Israel . Ari could not carry out the entire operation alone , not with the Syrians on his back . Barkai had to show . Just then he felt the need to urinate . " Too much coffee , " he mumbled to himself as he rose and shuffled toward the rear of the room . When he returned from the bathroom , he saw a man looking out from the front doorway , his back facing the cafe . Ari 's heart skipped a beat . It was Barkai . Finally . As the adrenalin rushed through his veins he moved toward the lieutenant . Before he had crossed half the cafe , Shaul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope inside Ari snapped . His eyes had been playing tricks on him . It was n't Barkai ! The man standing in the doorway was about the same height and build as Barkai but the resemblance ended there . Ari stopped in the middle of the room and forcibly tried to calm himself . He was slipping farther than he 'd realized . He went back to the table , fighting an internal war of nerves he had fought before and lost . He ordered a bottle of arak . When it came he gingerly unscrewed the cap , poured himself a glass of the clear liquid , and drank it quickly . There was an unwrapped toothpick lying on the table . Ari hesitated for a moment , thinking that it might have been used , then laughed at himself . He took the thin piece of wood and began working his back teeth . It seemed silly to worry about other people 's germs when he chose lovers so haphazardly , without any concern for  | hygiene . He supposed everybody at times , unable to wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He remembered that when he was sixteen he and a German girl named Anna spent an entire summer with head colds . They were infatuated with each other and kept passing the cold back and forth . They could n't refrain from kissing long enough for both of them to get well . Angrily Ari spat the toothpick on the floor , poured himself a glass of arak , drank it , then poured another . Why was he thinking about that German girl now ? He directed his thoughts elsewhere , concentrating on a still lake in the Bavarian Forest outside Regensburg that always soothed him when he walked along its shores . lie could almost smell the scent of the pine trees climbing the nearby hills . Suddenly Rachael 's face appeared on the surface of the water . She stared up at him without a sign of recognition . He closed his eyes . The image held in his mind for a moment , then dissolved into blackness . Barkai never showed . Befikre returning to the New Ommayad Ari stopped at a falafel stand across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sandwich consisting of a round of pita bread , slit , and filled with discs of ground chick peas and pieces of tomatoes , pickles , and cabbage . He ordered his without the usual yogurt sauce . Eating the falafel as he walked , he hurried into the hotel and up to Kim 's room . He would make a decision about what to do later . At the moment he needed to relax ; to divert his thoughts away from the Service , his assignment , and the absent Israeli Intelligence officer . When he entered her room , Kim literally exploded into his arms . " They printed my pictures of Khan esh Shill in the International Herald Tribune ! " she said , excit-157  | edly waving the newspaper in her hand as she let go of him . " Let me see . " He looked at the paper , wanting very much to be part of her happiness . There were two pictures at the bottom of the page : one of a shelled building , gaping holes gouged out of its side ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth for the dead . Under the pictures was the by-line : K. Johnson . If Ari had any trace of doubt about her being who she said she was , it was now erased . Though he found himself unable to share in her success , he kissed her . At least it might help reduce the tension within him . " But you have n't heard the best part , " she said , pushing him away . " Somebody from the Foreign Ministry called and asked if I would like to take pictures of Israelis captured in border skirmishes since the October ' 73 War . It seems the American government has been pressing the Russians to get the Syrians to let the Red Cross in and visit the prisoners . It 's a little complicated , but the man who called was very impressed with the coverage in the Tribune . He 's invited me to photograph the Israeli prisoners to show that they are being treated within the confines of the Geneva Convention . " She took his hand and held it in hers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my door just to get a chance at printing the pictures . I 'm so excited , this is such a lucky break . " She rested her head on his shoulder , then jerked it up again , too agitated to settle in one place for more than a few seconds . Ari sat down , marveling at her exuberance , vaguely jealous that he was never able to get that excited about anything . " When are you going to take these pictures ? " " I do n't know . He did n't say . But it sounded like it  | would be soon . He told me he would call again tomorrow morning . " " Who was it that phoned ? " " I do n't know . I is mentioned his name , but I was so excited I forgot to write it down . " She frowned . " Do you think it matters ? " Ari lit a cigarette , slowly waving the match in the air until the flame went out . " No , as long as he intends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you remember his name or not . " He hesitated for a moment , then looked up at her . " Did he mention where the Israeli prisoners you 're to photograph are being held ? " " Yes , but it was something in Arabic . I do n't recall it ; those names are hard to remember . " " Does Tadmor or Sigin al-Mazza sound familiar ? " " Al-Mazza prison , that 's it ! " she said excitedly . " How did you know ? " " There was an article on the Syrian penal system in Le Monde a few days back , " he lied . " It said Israeli prisoners are usually kept in Tadmor in the north or al-Mazza , just outside Damascus . " Ile knocked a bit of ash from his cigarette into the wastebasket near the dresser . " The Syrians obviously do n't know you 're half Jewish . " She shrugged . " I 've never been involved in any Jewish activities , my name 's not ethnic , and on my visa application under religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not quite sure what a Unitarian is , but I figured the Syrians would n't know either and probably would n't bother to ask . " If she expected him to laugh he disappointed her . " Are you going to be able to talk to the prisoners in addition to photographing them ? " " I do n't know . I assume there will be a translator and some sort of communication . " 159  | Ari thought about Dov . The Nazis had been less than anxious to discuss the details surrounding his penetration of the German colony and subsequent arrest . He doubted he 'd be able to get much information out of them ; they seemed embarrassed by the whole affair . But , if Dov was at al-Mazza , there was a possibility Kim could contact him and find out how much he had told his interrogators . " There 's a specific prisoner I 'm interested in who very likely is at al-Mazza penitentiary , " he said , weighing his every word for the effect it would have . " Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You knew about al-Mazza before we came to Syria . " He nodded . " How ? Why are you interested in Syrian prisons ? " He recalled the Colonel 's casual , last-minute request for information about Dov , realizing again how important an accurate report would be . It was worth the risk . The mission was falling apart ; he had to salvage something , and there was a good chance Kim could reach Dov. it He took a deep drag off his cigarette , holding the smoke in his lungs for a long time before exhaling . " I know about al-Mazza because it holds more than a dozen of my countrymen , " he said . " I 'm an Israeli . My real name is Ari Ben-Sion . " She stared at him in disbelief . But after a few seconds the surprise in her eyes faded . " Ari Ben-Sion . " She repeated the name . " Now everything makes sense : why you were in Jerusalem , why you 're so secretive , so distant . " She rushed toward him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in place . He did n't know why he threw up a barrier after having told her so much . Maybe it was because he was vulnerable now , both as a spy and as a man ; and men , when vulnerable , tend to retreat behind harsh exteriors.  | She dropped back on the bed , a shadow of pain clouding her face . " But I do n't understand , if you 're an Israeli , then . . . " " Then what ? " " Then  --  we 're both Jews . " " Ironic , is n't it ? " " Oh Hans , " she said . " I mean Ari . Now I understand . You came to Damascus because of this Israeli in al-Mazza prison . " She paused , suddenly excited . " I 'll probably be going there in a few days . Maybe I can help . Maybe I 'll see him or can get a message to him via one of the other prisoners . I 'm not afraid . I 'll try anything . Just tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and looked out at the sun-scorched city . " The Israeli 's name is Dov Elon but I did not come to Damascus because of him . " He was stalling ; he did n't want her to realize the only reason he 'd told the truth about himself was to use her . " I do n't understand . " It seemed to Kim that he had offered to let her help , then abruptly snatched the opportunity away . " II you 're afraid you ca n't trust me , why did you bring up Dov Hon the first place ? " " I said Dov is not the main reason I 'm in Damascus , which has absolutely nothing to do with trusting you . " " " Then you 're in Syria on some assignment for the Israeli government . " " I 'm a spy , " he said matter-of-factly , the way other men stated their profession as a doctor or a lawyer . She looked up at him , fear reflected in her eyes . " That means if you 're caught , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ground out his cigarette with the same casual indifference the Syrians would display in snuffing out his life if he were captured . " Ari , I 'm scared . " He slowly took out a fresh cigarette , tapped the butt 161  | on the armrest to pack in the tobacco , and lit it . " I 'm scared too . " " What is it ? " she asked nervously . " Why are you in Damascus ? If you 're arrested and hung I do n't think I 'll be able to stand it unless I know . It must be something important or you would n't risk your life like this . " " You will be much safer if I do n't tell you . No interrogator can extract information you do not possess . I prefer not to involve you any more than I need to  --  it 's too dangerous . " " What do you mean not involve me ! " she said angrily . " You talked me into traveling here with you . I 've been seen repeatedly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . I am involved ! " " Kim , I ca n't tell you anything else . " " Then get out of here , " she said coldly . " I 'll take the first available flight to Europe . " Her sudden harshness stunned him . He sat there , on the verge of losing her , unable to do anything about it . At a loss for words he rose , not wanting to leave , but he had no choice . He could n't tell her about the children . " Damn it , where do you think you 're going ? " " You told me to leave . " " So now I 'm telling you to stay . " " Kim , I just ca n't tell you anything else ; you have to trust me . " She stood up and faced him . " Okay , okay . I 'll trust you . I 'll just stand here like a little china doll . I wo n't ask questions or learn too much about anything  --  that way we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll spread my legs , that is if you 're sure ' your penis wo n't shatter me . " He slapped her across the face , the crack of his hand against her cheek slicing through him like a knife . Ile 162  | stood there , his arm hanging awkwardly at his side . " Kim , I 'm sorry . . . " Apologizing made him feel even cheaper ; his words were so inadequate . Tears tumbled from her eyes . " That 's all right , " she said , forcing a smile . " The china doll did n't break . " He wrapped his arms around her waist and held her against him . " You mean so much to me , " he said , reaching down to kiss her . She let his lips meet hers , but that was all ; she did n't respond . He kissed her harder . She drew back and looked at him . " Why do men always try and make love to a woman after they 've hurt her ? Do you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips ? " He dropped his hands . " I guess it 's a way of hiding , of escaping from guilt . " " But you are really arrogant enough to think that you can slap me across the face , then kiss me , and I 'll feel better ? " " I guess I 'd like to fool myself into thinking that . " " Can you ? " " No . " " Your slapping me hurt you more than it hurt me ; it showed on your face . Every time I get close to what 's locked inside you , you erect a barrier between us and crouch behind it . Even when we 're in bed , when you 're deep inside me , you hold back , as if you feel guilty about making love , or loving itself . " He fidgeted uneasily . " You remind me of a lion cub who wants to be petted , but who lashes out at everybody with his claws before they can touch him . And I do n't know what you 're afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we ca n't go on like this , I 'm certain of that . Either you let whatever is inside you out , or I 'll leave . And this time I wo n't come back . "  | He bit his lower lip . There were so many things he wanted to tell her about his past , about the Service , about what it was like existing inside a hostile community , living year in and year out with the fear and the strain and the isolation . He hesitated , took out a cigarette , then returned it to the pack . " Kim , it will take time . " " I have plenty of time , " she said , sitting on the bed . " But I do n't . At least not now , not until we 're out of Syria . I have a mission to complete here and I must channel all my energy into it . Afterward there will be time to explain , as much time as we want . I 've decided this is going to be my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be diverted by personal considerations . I 've got to see it through successfully and I know my limitations . I wo n't be able to function efficiently if I crack myself open and show you what 's inside . I 'm just too tired . I do n't have the strength to do both at once . " He was n't quite sure if he believed his own excuse . She removed her watch and set it on the end table . " What about this Dov Elon ? You said he 's not the main reason you came to Damascus but that means he must be connected to some secondary reason . Is there anything I can do to help while I 'm at al-Mazza ? " He nodded ; he was about to bring up the subject himself . " If you find Dov and can manage to get rid of your guide for a few moments , just tell him the Colonel needs to know if Sarraj forced him to talk . " " But will he trust me ? Wo n't he think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't there a password or some-thing ? " She was right . He 'd already anticipated her question and realized there was only one thing she could tell him that would guarantee his trust .  | " There 's no password , " he said painfully . " Just tell Do you know Ari was responsible for his capture . There 's no way a Syrian could have that information . " Kim looked up at him , her eyes wide . But she said nothing .  | FROM ATOP the minarets wailing voices pierced the morning , waking the somnolent city , calling the followers of Muhammad to prayer . After a few minutes the undulating chant ceased and Damascus fell silent again . Inside the towers the guardians of the faith turned their record players off and reset the needles in preparation for the next appointed hour of prayer . Worship of the cult of civilization had struck even here . The cries beckoning believers to Syria 's mosques were prerecorded by professional muezzins in Mecca . Ari lay awake . Noises had kept him up most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked over at Kim , wanting to stroke her soft skin , yet not wanting to wake her . Curled on the far edge of the bed , she was sleeping peacefully . He flipped over on his back and stared up at the ceiling . It would be selfish to disturb her , he decided . So , moving closer to the wall , he let his thoughts turn to the absent Shaul Barkai . The phone rang and he snatched at it . A call so early might be the contact he was waiting for . " Hans Hoffmann ? " " Yes . " Ari sat up excitedly . The voice was familiar . This could be it . Finally . 166  | " Sorry to disturb you so early , it 's Franz Ludin . " Disappointment . " Good morning , " Ari said , forcing cheerfulness into his tone . " I did n't wake you , did I ? " He glanced at Kim ; she was still sleeping . " No , I 've been up for a while . " " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning let me make you an offer . Ludwig Streicher and I are meeting for breakfast in a restaurant next to the Ministry of Justice . Why do n't you join us ? " " I do n't know , " Ari hedged . He wanted to decline the invitation . Streicher was suspicious of him and another meeting might afford the Wehrmacht colonel the opportunity to penetrate his cover . " We are going to discuss a topic I 'm sure will be of great interest to you . Colonel Streicher specifically suggested I ask you to come along . " Ile had lost his chance to decline graciously . " In that case I would be delighted to join you . " " Excellent . We will expect you at the Saf'ar Pacha Restaw ant itt about an hour . It 's right next to the government buildings in Mat jell Square . You ca n't miss it . " " I 'll he their . " Ile bid Ludin good-bye and hung up . Kiln was still sleeping . IIe touched her gently on the shoulder and whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then retreated back into her dreams . " I 'm going out for the morning , " he said . She turned toward the wall . As he climbed out of the bed and headed for the shower he realized she had n't heard him . Ari walked into the Safar Pacha Restaurant and moved  | immediately toward a corner table where Ludin and Streicher were waiting . The restaurant was clean but by no means elegant . Plain wooden tables were arranged along the four walls as well as in the center of the room . Arabs , wearing dark suits , sat around them eating hurriedly . From their dress and manner Ari assumed the Safar Pacha was a meeting place for low-ranking government officials . " Please sit down , " Ludin said , as he approached the two Nazis . Ari smiled and chose the empty chair across from Streicher . He wanted to face his adversary squarely . " Are you enjoying your stay in Damascus ? " Streicher asked . " Very much so . " " Your purchase of merchandise is proceeding satisfac-torily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several shipments to Europe . All indications are that olive wood articles will sell in large quantities , particularly hand-carved backgammon sets . There seems to be an almost limitless market for them . Although the quality of Damascene textiles turned out to be somewhat disappointing , I would have to say that overall my stay here has been quite productive . " " And not only from the business aspect , " Ludin added , smiling . Ari 's face reddened ; little pinpoints of heat pricked his cheeks . " Franz tells me you are especially fond of , shall I say . . . kosher meat . " " What are you driving at ? " Ari pushed his water glass across the table , watching a damp trail form in its wake . " Franz knows what I want from the Jews . I told him so myself . " " It just seems unusual that after spending so much  | time with an attractive American , you still find it necessary to drag the dirt from the gutter into your bed . " " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you gentlemen . " Ludin drummed his fingers on the edge of the table . " Why did you go to see Rachael Khatib ? " " Because I wanted to fuck her , " Ari said angrily . " I get a thrill out of screwing Jewesses . I do n't understand why . I wish I could feel the same way about other women , about Miss Johnson , but I do n't . " He looked into Ludin 's eyes . " You think I like it this way ? You think I 'm happy that in order to find sexual relief I have to haunt the Jewish ghettos of every city I visit , searching out the dregs of humanity ? How do you think I feel afterward ? Like some conquering hero ? Like a wild stallion ? No ! I feel like an ostrich who has to bury his head underground . I want to smash the bitch 's face , relight the crematoria and throw her in . But that feeling soon fades . After a while the hunger returns , gnawing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it again . " Ari was breathing heavily . Hate burned in his eyes ; hate directed not at the Nazis sitting across from him , but at the Jews . For a brief moment his real self submerged into the void and he became Hans Hoffnann . He saw the Jews as the assassins of Christ , as murderers who stealthily stole up behind Christian children , slit their throats , then drained the blood for use in the baking of Passover matzoth . For a sickening second he saw the Jews through the eyes of the rest of the world : invading aliens , more e tinning than clever  --  different , dangerous , and deserving destruction . " How long have you felt like this ? " Streicher asked . The sound of the Nazi 's voice snapped Ari back into his cover story . " Ever since I was a teenager in Stutt-169  | gart , " he said , head bowed . " There was this Jewish girl , Eva Gruener , who lived next door to my family . She kept flaunting her body at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begging that she let me make love to her . Finally she said yes . I brought a blanket to the park and we undressed in the middle of a dense clump of trees . When it was time I could n't do anything . She started laughing . I was so embarrassed I picked up my clothes and ran . Later she told all my friends I was impotent . " " So then you really do understand your obsession with the Jews , " Streicher said . Ari nodded . " Sometimes when I 'm screwing one of the bitches I see Gruener 's face . But she is n't laughing any more . " Ari looked at both Ludin and Streicher . He could n't tell if they believed him . Suddenly Ludin laughed and turned to his companion . " Now that he has explained himself , his behavior makes sense . I think your suspicions are unwarranted , Ludwig . I must admit I find no reason to doubt that Herr Hoffmann is who he says he is . " Streicher grunted . " In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacted a member of the ODESSA underground in Stuttgart and had his identity verified . " " Of course not , " Ari said . Before Streicher could continue the waiter arrived carrying a metal tray loaded with dishes . Effortlessly he lowered the plates of eggs , rice , fresh figs , and sweet al-Juban cheese to the table . Then he hurried back to the kitchen , promising to personally brew their coffee . The three men ate in silence punctuated only by the sound of their forks scraping the heavy plates . The espresso arrived and they began talking about Hafez Assad 's liberalizing reforms and the effect they 'd had on the Baath Arab Social Renaissance Party . Finishing his breakfast , 170  | Streicher abruptly put down his silverware and excused himself , claiming that he was late for an appointment . Ari sensed that he was lying , that he had wanted to begin checking his credentials . Immediately . " You must try and understand my colleague , " Ludin said , after Streicher had left . " Ever since Soviet military personnel moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such tasks as supervising the clean-up of latrines and the laundering of enlisted men 's uniforms . The Communists refuse to have anything to do with us  --  it seems the twenty million Russians we killed during the war is a little difficult for them to forget . Ludwig is bitter ; in the late 1940s he helped forge a bunch of bedouin , camel breeders , and frightened city boys into the fighting force now known as the Syrian army . But one of the conditions the Soviet Union set before they began supplying Syria with sophisticated weaponry was that all Wehrmacht personnel be purged from positions of authority . In 1957 , in the aftermath of the Suez War , President al-Kuwatli dismissed scores of German military advisers to make way for the Russian and Czech missions . Streicher was decorated for outstanding . en'u'rs to the Syrian nation , then promptly relieved of active duty . ' I hat 's one of the reasons why he 's so suspicious of you and everybody else . Questioning your creentials gives him something to do . It swells his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see , " Ari said quietly . Streicher , the twice-deposed , twice-frustrated Nazi was on the verge of exposing him because he had nothing better to do than chase after faint scents in the wind . This time , however , Streicher had edged his nose too close to a flower , without first checking to see if a bee was n't waiting there , poised , ready to explode in his face . " But how do you stay in favor with the Syrians if the 171  | Russian influence is so strong ? " Ari asked . " I maintain a privileged position because the Syrians consider Brunner , Wolff , myself , and the other SS officers far superior to the Russians in dealing with the Jews . They compare our concentration camp statistics to the Soviets sending tens of thousands of their Jews to Israel each year . Need I say the Arabs prefer our solution to the Jewish problem . " Ari nodded understandingly , but something Ludin had said stuck to the edge of his thoughts . He was beginning to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dov . " You said one of the reasons Streicher is suspicious of me is because questioning my credentials makes him feel like he 's engaged in important work . But I sense there is more to it than that . He seems ill at ease , as if he 's worried about something . " " You are quite right , my friend . Something has all of us worried . It started with that Eli Cohen business in , 1965 , with the shock that we are vulnerable , even here . Then , earlier this year , two former German officers , Captain Rainer Kriebel and SS Standartenfiihrer Walter Remmer , were found murdered in their apartments . It appears there is another Israeli agent operating in Damascus . " " But at the dinner party you said the Second Bureau had caught the Israeli spy . " " An Israeli , but not the Israeli . We are certain that this Dov Elon was not in the country when Remmer and Kriebel were killed . " " Interesting . Then there were two of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ari sipped from his glass of water . " But where does Streicher fit in ? I remember Wolff saying that Ludwig knew the captured spy . " " That is a slight understatement . Streicher and Elon 172  | became fast friends . Elon claimed to be an associate of Streicher 's dead brother . He knew everything about him . Ludwig was highly embarrassed when he discovered he had been unburdening his soul to an Israeli agent . " " So that 's really why he 's so suspicious of me . He does n't want to get burned again . " Ludin nodded . " But what about Elon , ca n't he be made to divulge the identity of the other Israeli ? " " He is in the hands of the Second Bureau . The Syrians are most brutal and Suleiman Sarraj is one of the worst . Only Yussaf Fuad , chief of the General Security Service , has outdone his excesses . Between the two of them they should be able to persuade the Israeli to talk . " " Then you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is there any possibility the Israeli is dead ? That could explain the Second Bureau 's silence . " Ludin shifted position in the uncomfortable chair . " Sa rai is a very careful man . Ile would not let Elon die until he had the inhumation he wanted . lithe Israeli has not talked , he is still alive . " " Some of those bastards are unusually stubborn . He might hold out indefinitely . " " I doubt it . Every man can be broken  --  can be pushed to the point where his mind refuses to endure more pain . When this happens he 'll betray his country , his lover , or his family . Some resist for days , others for months . But George Orwell was right  --  under a skilled interrogator in the end they all submit . " " Or lose their sanity . " " Yes , " Ludin agreed . " Unfortunately sometimes that is the case . " Ari realized it was pointless to press Ludin for details about Dov . The German knew little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's successful penetration of the German colony , had probably decided to keep the Nazis in the dark about the interrogation . He would gain no information from his current maneuver . His only hope of finding anything out lay with Kim . Ari took the cloth napkin from his lap and placed it on the table . " Franz , you really will have to excuse me , but I promised al-Husseini 's assistant I would meet him a half-hour ago . He has been tremendously generous with his time and I do n't want to keep him waiting any longer . " " Of course , " Ludin said , rising . " But we must get together again soon . I will speak to Ludwig about you , I 'm sure that he can be reasoned with . " " That 's not necessary , I have nothing to hide . " He snapped to attention and reached for Ludin 's outstretched hand , which felt warm and clammy . As Ari left the restaurant he looked at the green , white , and black Syrian tricolor floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan the Colonel had devised to insure the children were safely smuggled out of Syria . But where was Lieutenant Barkai ? Why had n't he shown up ? The timing of Operation Goshen was critical . The Colonel had honed the movements of the two Israeli agents with the precision of a Swiss watch . Nothing should have gone wrong , yet obviously something had . With the transmitter lost , and time chewing away at the days , Ari knew there were few alternatives open to him . He could claim he needed to check on his European outlets , fly to Frankfurt , and phone Jerusalem directly from there . But that would consume precious time he did n't have ; the children were scheduled to be taken out of Syria in seventy-two hours . It would look suspicious if he remained in Europe for only a day or two . Otherwise he could wait for Barkai and continue to 174  | ignore the Colonel 's orders  --  which had been explicit : if there was serious reason to believe that the Second Bureau was onto him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hotel suite Ari bolted the door , drew the curtains , then went into the bathroom . Removing a fresh bar of soap from the medicine cabinet , he peeled off the Yardley wrapper , thankful for the Mossad training that taught him never to carry all his equipment in one case . Though he had lost the Rhinehart bar of soap that contained the material he really needed , the substance embedded in the Yardley would serve as an adequate substitute . With a pocket knife he cut through the soap approximately four centimeters in from the right edge . He tossed the carved-off piece into the wastebasket , returned to the bedroom , and sat at his desk . The yellow soap had been dyed to blend with the color of the explosive concealed inside it . Ari measured another five centimeters and cut through the bar , this time carefully placing the segment of camouflaged chemical into the ashtray . I Iv measured off another two centimeters and sent his knife slicing through the soft soap again . Discarding the useless sliver , he held the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gingerly picked at the center with the tip of his knife . In a few seconds he extracted a small metal firing pin . Placing it on the blotter , he took the tetryl out of the ashtray and scraped off the outer layer of soap , leaving a small quantity of malleable , claylike plastique . From the desk drawer he withdrew a ball-point pen with the advertisement Banque de l'Unite Arabe printed on it in French and Arabic . Removing the ink cartridge , he put the tetryl in its place and set the firing pin , held under pressure created by the pen 's spring , above the charge . Along with a business card he 'd picked up from 175  | the bank manager 's office on Maawia Street , he slipped the lethal weapon into an envelope . He would have preferred to make a conventional letter bomb that would explode upon opening , but the potassium nitrate and stabilizing ammonium oxalate he 'd need had been lost in the toiletry case . However , there was little cause for concern . The recipient would inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending the firing pin into the tetryl ? detonating the fatal charge . Later that afternoon he dropped the envelope addressed to Ludwig Streicher in the " Damascus Only " slot at the main post office near the Serail. 176  | AR ! SAT at the desk in his hotel room chain-smoking , waiting for Kim to return from her tour of the Syrian prison system . On the floor by the bed lay the Englishlanguage Daily Star from Beirut , the crossword puzzle face up , the boxes completely filled in . A pot of coffee , laced with Scotch , rested on the dresser half empty . Ari closed his eyes . He did n't want to sleep , nightmares invaded his dreams regularly now , but if he could just rest for a few minutes .. . The phone rang , jolting him awake . The sound felt like a splinter of ice cold metal as it pierced his skull . There was pain inside his head and the back of his neck ached front the position he 'd assumed , slumped over in the chair . Groggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop the strident ringing than to discover who was calling . " Hans , it 's Franz Ludin . " The Nazi sounded distraught . " The Jews have gotten Streicher ! " " What happened ? " Ari asked , shaking his head , trying to clear the haze from his brain . " Some kind of letter bomb . The German colony 's in pandemonium . None of us is safe ! If a package , a letter , even a note arrives that at all looks suspicious , call the 177  | police before you open it . " The words raced out of his mouth  --  panic was pushing them . " Is Streicher dead ? " " I do n't know . He was rushed to the Mojtahed Municipal Hospital . I have n't had time to call over there . I 've been busy trying to alert the Germans living in Damascus . " " Then I better not keep you . Thanks for the warning . I 'll be careful . " Ari hung up , immediately got the hotel receptionist on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information at the Mojtahed Hospital . When the connection was completed Ari inquired about Streicher 's condition . After a pause the clerk came back on the phone . " I have good news for you , " she said . " Colonel Streicher was not seriously injured . He is conscious and out of danger . You may visit him tomorrow if you like . " " Thank you very much . I 'll do that . " " Can I tell him who called ? " Ari slowly dropped the receiver into place without responding . Something had gone wrong . He must have prepared the charge improperly  --  it should have killed its victim . Now he was in real trouble . Streicher , already suspicious , would make the connection between the attempt on his life and his probing of Ari 's credentials . It was now a race with time . Somehow he would have to see to it that Operation Goshen was executed on schedule , in forty-eight hours  --  hopefully before Streicher was well enough to push his inquiries about Hans Hoffmann any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The escape valve , Operative 66 . He could contact the deeply placed Israeli spy . The muscles inside Ari 's stomach contracted . But would the Colonel want him to take the risk ? What would the head of Israeli Intelligence say 178  | later , at his debriefing ? Ari reached for the bottle of Chivas Regal he kept perpetually near him now . The transmitter was gone , Rachael had been arrested , the Syrians were probably onto him , Barkai had n't shown , Streicher might have an answer from the ODESSA at any time . Ari gulped down the Scotch , hardly tasting it . As the last of the last resorts , the Colonel had said , if and only if a desperate emergency arises , you can contact Operative 66 . Ari could hear the pudgy man 's voice . He stared at the bottle of Scotch , then quickly refilled his glass . He was scared , afraid of the guilt that would haunt him if he inadvertently led the Second Bureau to Operative 66 . He would not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything else . But hesitating was pointless . As the days spun away his clutching back after them grew increasingly more futile . Everything had come apart . It was a desperate emergency . He decided he would contact Operative 66 as soon as the still descended and night offered a measure of protective cover . Their was a knock on the door and Ari rose to answer it , noticing that his legs diet not move quite as fast as his mind wanted them to . Kiln fidgeted in the hallway , impatient with the nervous energy of the young who , unlike those worn by life 's disappointments , ca n't wait very long for anything . She entered the room , closed the door behind her , and leaned back against the wood . " What about Dov ? " he asked quickly . " I was able to speak to a pilot alone for a few minutes . His English was bad and I 'm not sure I understood him correctly . " " Did he know anything about Dov ? " " He was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just brought down from Tadmor who was kept in a separate cell . " " Did he know his name ? Had anyone seen him ? " Kim shook her head . " I 'm sorry . " " Did you ask him why this prisoner was kept apart from the others ? " " Yes , but he did n't know . " " What about the other prisoners ? " he pressed anxiously . " Did n't they know anything ? Had n't anyone spoken to him ? " She moved close and touched his shoulder . " There were guards with me the whole time . It was only by luck that I managed to speak to even one prisoner alone . My escort returned after a few minutes and stayed close the rest of the afternoon . " Ari spun around and her hand fell away from him . It was Dov . He was certain of it . Biting his lip , he stared at the blank wall . He 'd hoped Dov had found a way to commit suicide , to end his ordeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can get permission to go back . The man from the Foreign Ministry liked me . In fact he liked me a lot . He made it perfectly clear that he would do anything he could for me if we pursued our relationship . Maybe if I offered to discuss my photography at his home one night he might do some checking on Dov . I 'm sure I could think of a way to ask him without his getting suspicious . " Ari stiffened . She moved behind him and began working her fingers into his tight back and shoulder muscles . " Do n't , " he said , though he did n't want her to stop . She ignored him and dug her fingers deeper into his knotted flesh . He turned around to face her . " Kim , I do n't want you to do it . I need to find out about Dov , but not that way . " " Why not ? " she said angrily . " You told me you believe 180  | in results , not in rules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell me you 're trying to protect my honor , I would n't want to laugh . I 'm not exactly a virgin and if you were too preoccupied to notice let me assure you that you were not the first man I 've climbed into bed with . In fact I 'm pretty well broken in . One Arab minister more or less would hardly make much difference . I could probably knock him off two or three times and get him to do anything I wanted . These Arabs are crazy about blondes . They think we 're some kind of exotic sex goddesses just because none of their women are fairskinned . I would n't even have to put out much of a performance . I could just lie back and let his male ego ravish me . " " Stop it ! " " Why ? " she said loudly . " You 've offered me nothing but vague promises about what it will be like after we leave Damascus . And now you want exclusive control over my body . Are n't you being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want and if I feel like screwing ; some fat Arab to get information to help you , goddammit I 'm going to do it . " Ile backed away , bumping into a chair . " No . " " I do n't understand . I thought it meant a lot to you to find out about Dov . You said the Colonel wanted to know , that because of you he ... " " I did n't come to Damascus to find Dov ! " Ari said . It look a great deal of effort to push what was forming in his mind into words . " I came on a mission that must be completed in the next two days or else it will be too late . I have to forget about every other distraction or else I 'll fail , and the price of that failure will be the destruction of seven lives . I told you before I can not let personal considerations affect my better judgment and that judg-181  | ment says concentrate on my mission and drop everything else . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . He knew that he had to tell her to leave , that he needed one hundred percent concentration for the next fortyeight hours and that as long as she was near some part of him would be thinking about her and not the mission . Besides , she was in danger . Her association with him could bring the Second Bureau crashing down on her . Everything he had learned in the Service demanded he send her away . He started to speak but stopped . He could n't do it . He had to tell her to leave but the words would n't come out . They just would n't . " Just be patient for a few more days , " he said . " Do n't ask any questions and do n't do anything for me on your own . If all goes as planned I 'll be leaving Syria Saturday night . You can meet me in Jerusalem . Just go to Eighteen Ruppin Street and ask for the Colonel . Can you remember that without writing it down ? " She nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said nothing , the answer implicit in his silence . " What about Dov , ca n't I at least try ? " " Forget about Dov , " he said loudly , but without menace in his voice . " There 's no time . I do n't want . . . " Suddenly he was powerless to push back the emotion rising in his throat . He was responsible for Dov 's capture , for the suffering the boy had endured all these months . He and he alone . Ari cried softly , surprised at what was happening  --  he had thought himself as incapable of crying as he had been of loving . Detachment was the rule of life in the Service . He had always followed that formula , knowing no other . Now , suddenly , his whole world had pitched on its axis . 182  | Kim remained where she was  --  silent , waiting . He said nothing for a long time , vaguely aware that the flow of tears had carried away some barrier inside him . Finally he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drying his tears with her lips . Tumbling onto the bed , they undressed and made gentle love , staying locked together a long time , not wanting to start the rhythm that would inevitably end too soon . Kim ran her fingers to the nape of his neck , swirling up eddies of excitement . He tried not to anticipate the ecstasy he felt as her fingernails slid with barely perceptible contact around his waist , up his sides , and outward along his upper arms . Feeling pressure in his groin he slowly withdrew from her  --  they were not ready yet . She leaned over and ran her tongue along the same route her fingers had explored . The excitement churned into joy . Her lips danced along his skin so softly that he could not tell when she touched him and when he felt only the warmth of her breath . She worked her way over his stomach . Ile lay back . After a few minutes she stretched out on top of him . I le kit the wet warmth between her legs as they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forehead with his lips . " Nothing is going to keep us apart . " Smiling , she outlined his nose with her forefinger . " I do n't want to be left here . Can I come with you when you leave Saturday ? " He hesitated . He did n't even know if Operation Goshen was still viable . In either event it would be safer for her to travel by commercial airliner , alone . " Maybe , we 'll see , " he said . " They lay entwined in each other 's arms for a long time without speaking . The sheets were soft and the touch of her skin , smooth and warm . But he could n't stay . When it grew dark he silently got up and made his way into the 183  | bathroom , trying to shake the haze from his brain . He 'd been half asleep . The cold spray of the shower brought his body into painful submission . After a few minutes he was alert and thinking clearly . To insure that he was not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the utmost care . There could be no slipups . He dried himself and went into the bedroom to dress . " Are you going out ? " Kim asked . He turned and looked at her . " No more questions . " She dropped her head onto the pillow and watched him . " Can I ask what time you 'll be back ? " " No . " When he finished putting on his clothes he stood over the bed . Kim lay naked on top of the sheets . She had n't bothered to drape anything over herself . " Just be patient , " he said . " If all goes well tonight we 'll be leaving Syria in a little over forty-eight hours . " She smiled . He turned and headed toward the hallway , an uneasiness building in his stomach . He hoped he was doing the right thing . Reaching the elevator , he pushed the down button . The white plastic knob turned red . While he waited for the doors to part he ran over in his mind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Colonel had made it clear that , if necessary , he expected him to move along the predesignated route with the utmost caution . Ari was to turn around if he even suspected anyone was following him . Operative 66 was not to be jeopardized , under any circumstances .  | PATTERNED ON its French counterpart , Le Deuxieme Bureau de l'Etat Major  --  the Second Bureau of the General Staff , Syria 's military intelligence service  --  remains separate and distinct from the Mukhabarat , Syria 's general security service . These agencies , in bitter competition , duplicate and often sabotage each other 's work so that their leaders might achieve a further measure of personal political power . Directors of the Second Bureau and the Mukhabarat often become chiefs of staff , ministers of defense or interior , or presidents of the republic . Rarely do the two services even attempt to work together . So it was not without a certain uneasiness that Yussaf Fuad , head of the Mukhabarat , agreed to join General Suleiman Sarraj in his Second Bureau office on a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The structure just west of the walls of the inner city that houses the Second Bureau looks much like the other Kanawat district office buildings that flank it on either side . They are all under a dozen stories high , with white stone and stucco facades blackened by the exhaust spewing from the cars and buses passing noisily below them . The entrance to the underground garage below 14 Taa-  | dil Street is squeezed between the Cafe Tingiz and a barber shop , and signs advertising the businesses housed inside decorate the stone front of the building . There are buttons for floors one through nine in the elevator next to which a directory reveals the names and office numbers of various trading companies , insurance firms , consulting agencies , and similar corporate concerns . However , if one was inclined to count the number of stories from the outside an unlisted tenth floor would appear . In the elevator under the alarm buzzer is a slot , which , when fitted with a special key , powers the elevator to the Second Bureau offices at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarraj and Yussaf Fuad sat displayed an opulence that would have angered the average Damascene taxpayer had he known of its existence . A thick Persian carpet blanketed the floor and ornate tapestries hugged the walls  --  against them hung rows of silver plates inlaid with gold . Sarraj ' s large desk was of polished mahogany ; on the corner a pair of handcarved gazelle bookends supported an illuminated edition of the Koran . The suite also contained the only air conditioning unit in the building . General Sarraj stared at the file folder that lay open before him . The Second Bureau chief was conservative and calculating ; his operations meticulously planned , and executed according to a preset timetable . He despised spontaneity and treated any deviation from his exact orders with a ruthless vengeance . The fifty-sixyear-old graduate of the Gendarmerie , the Horns Military Academy , and the French General Staff College had built a career on his ability to foresee the demands of the future and accommodate himself to the needs of the present . He had spied successfully on the French for the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the French and the British for the Germans . His prowess at adapting 1$ to changes of regime was particularly important in Damascus , the scene of so many rapid and abrupt shifts of power . Physically Sarraj 's appearance was in total harmony with his temperament . His dark hair was combed to one side , each hair set in its proper place . He exercised regularly , which caused his face to bear a youthful appearance that hid his actual age . His plain brown suit hung on his narrow shoulders with an effortless grace ? a grace that did not carry over into his interpersonal relations . Sarraj was self-conscious about being short , particularly in the presence of powerfully built men like Yussaf Fuad . Extracting an 8 x 10 photograph from the folder on his desk , the dark-eyed , moustached general handed it to the Mukhabarat chief . " This is Major Ari Ben-Sion of Israeli Intelligence , " he said . Fuad , tall , heavy-chested , wearing an olive green military shirt without a jacket , took the picture in his large hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army ranks by virtue of his viciousness , eliminating his rivals when it was necessary , and often when it was not . 1Ic produced results , no matter what the cost  --  monetary or otherwise . His Mukhabarat , unlike the Second Bureau which operated in Western countries , was exclusively concerned with questions of security inside the Arab world . He personally controlled the Makatib al-Khassah , a special internal police force which yearly spent more than a million Syrian pounds on some 8,500 political informers . Fuad tapped the picture on the edge of the desk , then set it down . " And Major Ben-Sion is in Damascus now ? " Sarraj nodded . " Under the guise of Hans Hoffmann , in importer of furniture and textiles . The Zionists do not know that the Russians broke his cover some time ago . " lit picked up the photo and snapped at it with his fore-187 finger . " This one did us much harm before we found out about him and his weakness . " " His weakness ? " Sarraj smiled . " Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It happens sometimes , when an agent 's been allowed to remain in the field too long . The prolonged , utter aloneness begins to take its toll . A need for warmth arises , interfering with the ability to function effectively . A little over five months ago he was diverted by one of my agents near Kyrenia . " Sarraj slid another photograph toward Fuad . The Mukhabarat chief laughed lasciviously at the picture of Michelle and Ari in embrace . " But do not be fooled by his falling so easily into my trap on Cyprus . This Ben-Sion is a clever one . He eluded the Russian , Czech , and Arab intelligence services for years , and did us quite a bit of damage in the process . The KGB finally broke his cover . I do n't have the details , but somehow they tied him to the assassination of an important Egyptian agent in London . " " You have him under surveillance ? " " Of course , " Sarraj said . " Lucky thing too . Three Palestinians jumped him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in . We had to remove them . " " Did Ben-Sion see your men ? " " I do n't think so , " Sarraj said . " He was unconscious at the time . " Fuad broke into a broad grin . " How long has he been in Damascus ? " " Fifteen days . I 've had him watched since he boarded the plane in Frankfurt . One of my agents sat directly across from him , but something very strange happened . When he arrived in Damascus one of his cases was stolen by a baggage boy . " " What 's so unusual about that ? " Fuad said . " The 188 street urchins who work at the airport are hardly of high moral integrity . I 'm sure it was not the first time an arriving passenger was relieved of his belongings . " " Of course . However , this seemed more than just a simple case of theft . I have not been able to locate the culprit or discover his identity , but I did find out he appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he had never been seen there previously . Furthermore , the operation was engineered with professional precision . The boy ran out of the terminal and was picked up by a waiting vehicle . One of my men got the license number . It turned out to be a rented car registered to a nonexistent company . " " You suspect Kessim 's Public Security Service or Nahlawi and the Police  --  or possibly my Mukhabarat ? " " I do n't know , " Sarraj said . " To be quite honest about it , I 'm at a complete loss . I have been unable to determine what was in the case or who stole it . " Fuad leaned back and rocked in the chair . " This is very odd , but go on . What can you tell me about the Israeli 's movements III I ) alnascus ? " " Ben-Sion carried a letter of introduction to the Trade Bureau from the Syrian ambassador in Bonn . It seems our illustrious diplomat was duped by the Zionists . He will be recalled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to bring him back now and risk tipping off . Jerusalem . " Fuad nodded in agreement . " He has spent a considerable period of time purchasing Damascene textiles , furniture , and handicraft and shipping the merchandise to Frankfurt , " Sarraj continued . " As I said , he is clever . After being here only two days he tricked that Nazi windbag Ludin into having a Jewess sent from the haret to his hotel room . " " I guess he wanted to taste one of his own kind .
