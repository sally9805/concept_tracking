txt Sentiment for reforming the nation 's income tax system burst forth in Congress Monday , just in time to be recorded on the eve of the income tax filing deadline . Whether designed for the maximum political impact or not , more members introduced legislation involving income tax reform than on any previous day of the year .. Thrown into the legislature hoppers of both houses were measures ranging from simplifying the tax return forms to setting criteria for tax audits . S E N . CHARLES Mathias R. , Md. , for example , offered two hills . One , dealing with audits , would require the Internal Revenue Service to give a taxpayer a written notice explaining why his return was selected for audit , how the auditwill be conducted , and the rights of the taxpayer . The bill also would require the IRS to report to the Joint Congressional Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation the specific criteria it uses to select returns for audit , as well as annual reports of audit statistics . MATIIIAS 'S SECOND bill requires the IRS to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a taxpayer who is alleged to owe back taxes . Present law allows the IRS to impose the lien without court approval if it believes collection of the taxes will be jeopardized by delay . While Mathias ' bills , if they ' become law , might help some taxpayers with their 1974 taxes ? should they be audited or have a lien placed on their assets ? other measures introduced Monday will help the taxpayer only next year . THESE INCLUDE the House concurrent resolution introduced by Rep , Ronald M. Mottl D. , Ohio , a freshman , which calls ? on Congress to take whatever action necessary to simplify the tax forms . Mottl chose to introduce a resolution rather than a-specific bill because " it was faster and would not be controversial , " according to his staff . " Working up a bill would have taken too long . " " That 's another way of saying , " a staff member for an-o t h e r congressman offered , " that he could n't have gotten it in before April 15 . " THEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Md.1 , who joined with Mathias in cosponsoring a bill to protect the confidentiality of tax returns . Beall 's bill would try to prevent the misuse of tax returns which came to light during Watergate and subsequent investigations . Under the bill the only persons allowed access to tax returns would be the taxpayer himself , the IRS , and the Justice Department for enforcement of the tax code only , state tax officials , the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation , and the President ? under limited circumstances . A NEW YORK Democrat , Rep. Edward I. Koch , has proposed revising the tax tables so that married taxpayers and single taxpayers pay at the same rate and to eliminatewhat has become known as " the marriage tax . " The marriage tax came into being with the tax reform act of 1972 which was designed to help single taxpayers who could n't take advantage of joint filing . However , the 1972 act resulted in married workers paying a higher tax than they would if they were not , married whether they filed jointly or ps marrieds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRS " penalizing you for marrying , " accordng to Koch . The only way to settle it is to make every ' one pay the same tax , he concludes .
