In the Portage County , Ohio , courthouse last week , the trials began for the first of the Kent 25-students , outsiders and one professor indicted a year ago for rioting , arson and other crimes supposedly committed just before the campus shootings of May 4 , 1970 . On that day , four students were killed and ten wounded by National Guard gunfire . The same grand jury that handed down the indictments exonerated the National Guardsmen of any blame for the deaths . Last week a trial jury of eight men and four women visited the campus to examine the site of the slayings . TIME Correspondent William Friedman also looked in on the haunted campus to measure its mood a year and a half after the killings . His report : <P> On a crisp November afternoon , Kent State University resembles any other thriving Midwestern campus . Hirsute young men and their long-haired girl friends , identically dressed in blue jeans and peacoats , stroll hand in hand across a snow-covered reach of lawn . Their path is interrupted by bulldozed mud trails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new campus construction . <P> But Kent State today is nothing like Oberlin-or even Kent State , 1969 . The bloody afternoon of May 4 ensured that the campus would not be the same for years to come . Passers-by stop at the sculpture outside Taylor Hall , insert a little finger in a clean bullet hole and quietly move on . In general there is a sense of listlessness on the campus , coupled with a lingering frustration over the handling of what the students consider to have been a massacre . Last August the office of Attorney General John Mitchell dropped further federal investigation of the incident . Two nonradical students got up a petition calling on President Nixon to reverse Mitchell 's decision . They gathered more than 10,000 signatures in just eleven days and carried the petition to Presidential Aide Leonard Garment in Washington ; they have little hope of success . <P> Drastic Cuts . Kent 's new president , Glenn A. Olds , 50 , accompanied the students to Washington . He was named to replace Dr. Robert I. White , who retired after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad . Olds is past dean of international studies and world affairs for the State <P> University of New York , and most recently the U.S. representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council . His Government connections have led some students to brand him as " Nixon 's p.r . man on campus . " <P> Olds acknowledges his difficulties . He is aware that most of his students are disillusioned with the System , and that he can not proceed with the business of education until the question of May 4 is adequately resolved . On top of that , he must contend with a hostile state legislature , which has proposed drastic cuts in the state education budget . <P> No Outrage . Unquestionably , the school has calmed down ; the campus police force has been beefed up from 30 men to 88 , and most of the hard-core radicals have left school anyway . There have been no political rallies this year . Kent 's radicals came to the movement late in the game , and like Dostoevsky 's young radicals in The Possessed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says Dr. Edward Crosby , director of the Institute for African American Affairs : " The students had all been playing roles . They never expected violence . "
