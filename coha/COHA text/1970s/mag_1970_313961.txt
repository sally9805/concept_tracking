ON the walls of George Plimpton 's apartment and office , amid the photographs , posters , paintings , prints , drawings , letters , manuscript pages , animal heads , odd hats and assorted other mementos that take the place of wallpaper , are several cartoons . In one , a patient about to go under the knife looks up at the masked surgeon and plaintively asks : " Wait a minute ! How do I know you 're not George Plimpton ? " In another , set in some imaginary banana republic whose government is about to be overthrown , one mustachioed officer demands of his coconspirators : " Before we proceed with the coup , gentlemen . . . which one of you is George Plimpton ? " A third ( discreetly exiled to the office bathroom ) is set in a whorehouse . " See that new girl looking out the window ? " one prostitute whispers to another . " I hear she 's really George Plimpton . " <P> The funniest part is that none of these situations , the last one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or imagination of George Plimpton , the world 's consummate amateur . Sometimes , indeed , it is difficult to decide whether Plimpton is an amateur professional or a professional amateur , so intense is his desire to succeed in alien fields . He always loses but , in a larger sense , he always wins , proving that even in an age of constricting specialization a man can do almost anything he sets his mind to , if only for a moment . It is Plimpton 's triumph that he has restored the word amateur-which today is so often a synonym for bungler-to its original and true connotation : someone who takes up an art or craft not for gain but for love . <P> Consider what he has done . He has sparred three bloody rounds ( his blood ) with Archie Moore , then light heavyweight champion of the world . He has pitched to major league baseball stars in Yankee Stadium ; he has shanked and hooked his way over golf links in competition with the world 's top moneymakers , and lost to Pancho Gonzales on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training-camp quarterback for the Detroit Lions and missed baskets while working out as a forward for the Boston Celtics . <P> Three years ago , he toured with the New York Philharmonic as a percussionist-and was severely chastised by Conductor Leonard Bernstein when he set off a rack of sleigh bells out of tempo , ruining the first movement of Mahler 's Fourth Symphony . More recently he rode the high trapeze for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &; Bailey Circus and , as a one-line badman in a yet-to-be-released western ( Rio Lobo ) , he was shot and killed by John Wayne , who never could decide whether the tall ( 6 ft. 4 in. ) bit player 's name was Plimpleton , Pembleton , Parfilton or Plankton.
