txt Charity and red tape just do n't mix HE 'S WARM ; I guess I should look at it that way . My friend Stanley , the human icicle , has left his open-air suite of rooms along Lower Wacker Drive for warmer quarters , with side benefits that Include clean clothes , hot showers , a change of linen , and dinners of swiss steak with mounds or mashed potatoes . And If that sounds like the end of an 0 . Henry short story in which poor people and vagrants have merry Christmases in spite of things , we were certainly steering in that direction , but we 've taken a literary detour into " One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . " Stanley , who 's a proud Pole with the last name of Madrak , and whose mustache and beard curve up at the ends and make him look like the Count of Close-up With Jeff Lyon Monte Cristo , was the subject of my column nearly two weeks ago . He was living the life of a carton of Bird 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along Lower Wacker , the temperature was zero , and he was shivering so bad he could barely talk . He had no money , no friends , and his hand would n't work . He was eating from garbage cans . His sole , fine possession was a Thermos , but it was tough to get hot liquids to fill it , Drugstores and cafes threw him right out . NO MAN should have to freeze , I decided , so I wrote about Stanley 's plight . Chicago is a city with a big heart , I reasoned . There are agencies . Agencies with hot food and toasty beds and scalding coffee to put in a Thermos , and we give these agencies our dollars so that they will take care of the Stanleys of the world . The next morning I waited by my telephone to hear from these agencies . They must already have exceeded their monthly quotas of homeless Polish men with curlicue beards freezing to death under Wacker Drive , because none of the agencies called . But I did hear from a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her home until the weather warmed up , a man who would pay for a hotel room . In the days that followed checks began to appear , adding up to nearly $100 . People asked me to pass it along to Stanley . About 2 p.m. on the day the column appeared , I got a phone call from Police Cmdr. Paul V. . He is in charge of the 1st Police District , and he wanted to talk about Stanley . I have never known Cmdr. Paul V. // Stanley Madrak as a frigid resident of Lower Wacker . Homeless friend finds charity , red tape do n't mix // to be a particularly charitable man , so I listened up . " MEA CULPA , " Ile exclaimed . " What ? " I said , ' " Mea culpa . We 'll take a Inca culpa on that fella , living on Lower Wacker . We should have ' picked him up weeks ago . But . we 've taken care of it , Sent a wagon over there this morning and the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vague worry crept into my mind . " You took him to the Salve. lion Army , I guess , right ? " I ventured hopefully . " Not exactly , " said . " The . boys say they been picking that guy up for years and every time they take him to a mission he leaves right away , " " SO WHERE DID they take him ? " I asked , my alarm increasing . " To Chicago Stale Hospital . The Read Mental Health Center up north . I wanted to let you know . " Oh tine , I thought . We have taken a harmless , penniless , freezing person , who did n't once even ask for help , and we have put hint into the pecan jar for some close encounters of the Freud kind . Now I called Chicago Read . I got the social worker assigned to Stanley 's case . I-had visions of shock treatments , lobotomies , and nervo-dervo pills . " YES , I NNOW the case . " said the social worker , an extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do n't give shock treatments anymore . Mr. Madrak is in good hands . Right this minute he 's in a hot shower , and his clothes pre , hi the , washer . In a little while he 'll sit down to a hot meal . And then he 'll have his medication and everything will be . . . " - His medication ? I blurted. - Everyone gets medication here it ' they need it . He might be a bit anxious , or confused . " " IF HE IS , it is because lie was brought in there when he did n't ask to he ? " I asked . I have waited to see what would develop with Stanley . On Monday , I called the hospital again . . I was told I could n't get any information about Stanley . There 's something called patient confidentiality , and to tell me anything would violate slate law and Stanley 's right to privacy . I am not sure what Stanley 's rights are , but I think all he wanted in the first ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of a sudden , it 's his right that nobody can find out his fate . It took me die better part of an afternoon , but I found out a few things . Stanley has been diagnosed as paranoid . lie 's still a voluntary patient and has n't been committed , That means if lie asks to leave , doctors have five days to pet . idon the court to commit him or else to let him go . He almost certainly is getting medication , since that is " one of our , treatment modalities , " a doctor told me . NOW I WAN/T to be fair . The people at Chicago Read , and at the Mental Health Department offices downtown , seemed very kind and have assured Me that Stanley will be treated well . I believe them . Second of all , it 's warm at Chicago Read . not like Lower Wacker . Finally , maybe Stanley could use seine help . Ile seemed quite confused Monday on the telephone . But he also told me he is n't very hap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herd'I ? I ca n't go nowhere . " So 1 figure it this way . If all of us are any nicer to Stanley . he could begin to hate us.
