As he himself admits , Richard Nixon has a face that invites caricature . But lately the lampooning of the President has expanded far beyond the cartoonist 's drawing board and become a minor genre of the arts . Documentary Film Maker Emile de Antonio has compiled MilLHouse ( TIME , Oct. 18 ) , a wickedly derisive splicing of Nixoniana . Novelist Richard Condon ( The Manchurian Candidate ) has come forth with The Vertical Smile , a politico-sexual farce whose hero , Duncan Mulligan , is a Wall Street lawyer , transvestite and presidential candidate known , lest anyone miss the point , as " Funky Dune . " <P> Finally , Novelist Philip Roth ( Goodbye Columbus , Portnoy 's Complaint ) has written Our Gang , due out in November , starring President Trick E. Dixon , his wife Fitter , Attorney General Malicious , Vice President What's-his-name and others , including Jacqueline Charisma Colossus . In Roth 's manically scurrilous satire , Dixon stealthily retires to a bombproof White House locker room during a national crisis and suits up in his " Prissier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , the mimicry of Nixon 's manner and cadences is brilliant . Alternating between the Swiftian and the sophomoric , Roth has Dixon assassinated by drowning in an oversized Baggie and ending up in Hell , running for the office of Devil against Satan himself . <P> There may be some nasty fun in all of this meat ax malice , and some political truths as well . But most of it is so extravagantly hostile that even a determined Nixon hater may find himself feeling an unexpected sympathy for the victim.With enemies like that , Richard Nixon may have to lean less on his friends .
