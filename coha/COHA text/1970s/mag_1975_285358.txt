<P> In confinement at Maryland 's Fort Holabird , John Dean got a telephone call from his attorney , Charles Shaffer . " Are you sitting down ? " Shaffer asked . " No , " said Dean . " Sit down . " Dean did . Said Shaffer : " You 're free . " <P> Elated , but unable to reach his wife Mo in California because he had told her to keep their ever-ringing home phone off its hook , Dean began packing . He did so casually , since his fellow prisoner Jeb Stuart Magruder was near by , and Dean felt awkward about being released while Magruder remained confined . Then Magruder , too , was summoned to the telephone , and Dean got the drift of the conversation . He rushed up to Magruder . " Jeb , I got the same kind of phone call . " The two men joyfully hugged each other . <P> He 's Free . A third Holabird prisoner , Herbert Kalmbach , had been called to Washington by the Watergate special prosecutor 's staff for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington lawyer , Charles McNelis , when his Watergate attorney , James H. O'Connor , telephoned . " Is Herb there ? " O'Connor asked . " He 's free . I got it straight from the judge 's chambers . " Kalmbach picked up the phone and heard the news . His eyes filled with tears . <P> Thus did three of the men who were among the first to tell the truth about the Watergate cover-up learn that their prison terms had been cut short by a compassionate Judge John J. Sirica . Although they had formally applied for release earlier , Sirica had , in a sense , held them hostage until after the conspiracy trial ended . The testimony of Dean , Magruder and Kalmbach had helped convict four former officials of the Nixon Administration-John Mitchell , H.R. Haldeman , John Ehrlichman and Robert Mardian-in that trial . Former Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski believes , in fact , that the testimony of such lower-level members of the conspiracy , plus the celebrated March 21 , 1973 " cancer on the presidency " tape , would have produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the U.S. Supreme Court . <P> Judge Sirica refused to explain why he had freed the trio . Typically , he would only say : " I did what I thought was right . The orders will have to speak for themselves . " But TIME has learned some of the factors that Sirica considered . They included his belief that the three had been sufficiently punished for their Watergate transgressions , their cooperation with prosecutors , the lack of any move by the special prosecutor 's staff to oppose early release , and Kalmbach 's weeping at the trial , which dramatized the personal tragedy inflicted upon those caught up in the scandal . <P> The judge also apparently felt that the inexperienced Dean , the naive Kalmbach and the malleable Magruder had largely been exploited by the shrewder trio of Haldeman , Ehrlichman and Mitchell . Sirica , moreover , is known to favor setting an example of leniency for convicted men who cooperate in establishing the full truth of the circumstances surrounding their crimes .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
