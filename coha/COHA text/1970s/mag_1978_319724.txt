Friends , Romans , countrymen , lend him your ears . After almost 20 years of yearning to play Shakespeare , Richard Dreyfuss got his big chance in The Goodbye Girl , portraying an outlandishly gay Richard III - the King as a queen . This time , at the Brooklyn Academy of Music , Drey fuss is playing Shakespeare straight : he is Cassius to George Rose 's Julius Caesar . Dreyfuss , who has a hankering to be a history teacher , has thought a lot about his roles . Richard III , he feels , was one of the most wonderful of English Kings and needs rehabilitating . As for Cassius , " he is an absolutely sympathetic character . He did not hate Caesar . Rather he wanted to re-establish the republic . " One reason Dreyfuss has always wanted to play Cassius : " He is the smartest man in the play . " <P> Speed : average . Throwing arm : mediocre . Potential : may have started too late to make it . Such a rating from a major-league batting instructor might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case the instructor was Mickey Mantle and the player , Mickey Mantle Jr. , who at 23 wants to give baseball " my best shot .

Now trying out for a Yankee farmclub team in Hollywood , Fla. , he hopes to make up for lost time . So does his dad . " I was never around to work with him . I was always away , " says Mantle Sr. , 46 . " But if he had had my dad teaching him and working him like he did me , he would be good . " <P> Reporter : " I hear you do n't give interviews .

The occasion was the transfer to the state of Virginia of Leesylvania , a 485-acre tract once in the hands of the Robert E. Lee family and later purchased by the Ludwig-controlled American-Hawaiian Steamship Co . Said Ludwig at the ceremony : " I think the people of Virginia are entitled to one of the nicest possible parks in the United States . It is close to the Potomac , and it is close to the seat of some of our troubles and some of the action . " End of speech . <P> " When they told me I was going to make a screen test , I asked if the test would be true-false or multiple choice , " recalls the 1976 Olympic decathlon champion Bruce Jenner .

In one sequence he does a James Bond routine and brandishes a smoking umbrella . " He was really a lot of fun to work with . He made me feel relaxed , " says Hamill . Which helped during a mishap . Instead of being lifted straight up on harnesses for a " flying " number , Jenner and Hamill tipped over once they were airborne , becoming ungainly free-floating mobiles . Both preferred their ice capades.
