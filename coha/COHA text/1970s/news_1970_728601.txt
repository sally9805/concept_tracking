txt " We will never , ever sign a contract like that again , " a senior Australian Cabinet minister remarked ruefully about the 1963 agreement for 24 F-111C swing-wing aircraft . The Minister for Defense , Malcolm Fraser , had told Parliament that it would be 1974 before Australia was able to take delivery of the aircraft . In fact , it may never take delivery of them . It is much more likely at this stage that the Australian Air Force will end up equipped with the Phantom F-4 aircraft , a plane that it rejected in 1963 as not being good enough for the job . The F-111 purchase has always had its critics in Australia , both on grounds of performance and cost . With the passage of the years and the escalation in cost , the criticism has become more vocal . However , the government has always defended the purchase . This week it just about gave up even that . The only real reason it is stuck with the F-111 is that it signed a contract that locked it into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the plane nor any control over the specifications . Personnel change The Australian Government , which has always played down and frequently obscured the terms of the original contract , now has decided to reseal all . It can do so with reasonable political security , for all the major figures involved in the original contract now have left the political scene . And although the same government , in name , remains in power , its personnel are completely changed . In addition , the government is far from happy about the way in which successive American administrations have handled the F-111 contract . Legally , the Australians have been over a barrel and the Americans have held them to the letter of that contract . Only now , at this belated date when the original conditions have been drastically altered by U.S. Air Force decisions , has the American Government been willing to give any concessions . Even these were grudgingly given . ? While the Australian Government was really in no position to complain , it began to feel unreasonably squeezed when the Pentagon refused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear the agreement he had reached with Defense ? Secretary Melvin R. Laird . Mr. Fraser said the Americans were trying to wriggle out . The clearance then came through from Washington . // *Australians : never again ' // When Mr. Fraser outlined the history of the F-111 contract to the Australian Parliament , the Australian version of the F-111 saga indicated that Australian politicians and officials had been unbelievably na ? ve in their dealings with the American administration . For their part the Americans signed the Australians into a watertight legal document that has shown , in terms of goodwill , that business and politics do not mix . Mr. Fraser told Parliament that when Australia had ordered 24 F-111 aircraft in 1963 it agreed to take the aircraft on the same conditions and specifications as the USAF . However , the USAF had accepted the aircraft with very much downgraded specifications to those originally had not yet been demonstrated that the strength of the aircraft was adequate to sustain full flight maneuver loads with the required fatigue life expectancy . There were continuing difficulties with the wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of MAC steel . This steel is used in 15 critical components of the aircraft . No financial protection Apart from being prepared to fit in with the vague USAF specifications , the Australian Government was given no financial protection in the event of the aircraft failing to reach the performance capability needed . So far the Australian Government has laid out $250 million on the F-111 . This represents about 20 percent of the annual defense budget in Australia . Under the terms of the original contract Australia stands to forfeit the lot if it cancels . When Mr. Fraser went to Washington in April he had instructions to either negotiate some concessions on this contract or pay the bill and declare Australia out . As far as the Pentagon was concerned that was the way it was going to be . Only when the negotiators were cut down to U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard and Mr. Fraser did the American line soften . The change of heart was not motivated by sympathy alone . Australia is a major buyer of American equipment and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant . It has paid for all that it has received from the United States .
