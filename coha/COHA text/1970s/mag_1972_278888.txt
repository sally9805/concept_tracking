Every day there were new committee meetings and new resolutions to consider , but many interesting aspects of the U.N . Conference on the Human Environment never came to any vote . As delegates from 114 nations prepared to leave Stockholm last week , TIME Correspondent Friedel Ungeheuer cabled some impressions : <P> Motherhood was almost a dirty word here-but it had its defenders . At the scientists ' Environment Forum , Stanford Biologist Paul Ehrlich blamed half the world 's environmental problems on increases in population . A woman biologist from Nigeria , aided by four burly colleagues , startled the audience by seizing Ehrlich 's microphone and declaring that birth control was merely a way for the industrial powers to remain rich by preserving the status quo . Peace was restored only after Ehrlich conceded that the U.S. should curb its own consumption of natural resources before urging population controls on developing countries . Brazilian Economist Josu de Castro fumes at the very mention of birth control . " Genocide of the unborn ! " he charges . <P> Uniformed guards with dogs kept a wary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abandoned airport of Skarpnck , but the violent demonstrations the police feared never came . Instead , the students put on gentle " eco-skits " to dramatize " eco-catastrophes . " In one , for example , a girl painted as a skeleton and accompanied by drums and cymbals danced a warning about the radioactive fallout from French nuclear-bomb tests in the Pacific . Total damage to property caused by such activities : one broken window . <P> <P> At noon , many people gathered at the Grand Hotel , a pink elephant of a building with a view over the port ( impressively clean ) and the Royal Palace ( depressingly severe ) . The reason was simple . The U.S. Population Institute served a delicious free lunch there : marinated river salmon with sweet mustard , herring in fresh cream , tiny meat balls , thick slices of rare roast beef . To ask an environmentalist to dine , however , is to ask for trouble . Dr. Samuel Epstein , the Cleveland toxicologist who first warned of the harmful effects of the detergent component nitrilotriacetic acid ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer-causing aflatoxins . " Do n't know why the Swedes do n't get rid of them , " Epstein said . " They are so easy to detect-fluorescent . " <P> Economist Barbara Ward on the trend of speeches : " Truth is moving to platitude with alarming speed . " <P> The conferees fretted continually about the consequences of industrialization . Microbiologist Rene Dubos , generally the most optimistic of the U.S. 's major ecologists , said that modern farmers are putting more energy into the soil ( in the form of mechanization , fertilizers and pesticides ) than they are taking out in the form of bumper crops . By 1987 , Dubos predicted , such practices will cause enough pollution and depletion of resources to limit further growth . He offered the odd analogy of the medieval church builders in France , who decided to end their rivalry after the highest cathedral , in Beauvais , twice collapsed . " Every technology has its limits , " said Dubos.                    @
