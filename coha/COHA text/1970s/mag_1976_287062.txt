On the fifth floor of Detroit 's General Motors Building , in the center of a room ornately decorated in ivory and burnt orange , sits a 52-ft. - long table of highly polished walnut . Before each of the table 's 42 seats is a built-in microphone activated by a hidden button . It is a fitting setting for a spirited , but civilized , debate between powerful opponents who have come to know each other well . Such a square-off is exactly what is likely to begin this week when Leonard Woodcock , president of the United Auto Workers , reaches across the table to shake hands with George Morris , GM vice president for industrial relations , and open new contract negotiations between the union and the automakers . <P> The auto negotiations are the main event in this year 's crowded calendar of bargaining bouts . Nearly 700,000 of the 4.5 million workers involved in bargaining this year labor under pacts with GM , Ford , Chrysler and American Motors that expire Sept. 14 . Every auto negotiation carries the threat of a strike that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides rate the chances of settling without a strike this year as the best in memory . Main reason : the industry is booming , its workers are prospering and neither side sees much to justify a knockdown fight . <P> Last Midnight . No negotiator , of course , would dream of admitting that publicly . The union will , as always , choose a target company with which to conclude a pattern-setting agreement ( the betting in Detroit is that it will be Ford ) and doubtless continue talks down to the last midnight . Meanwhile , both sides are indulging in the usual rhetoric . GM Chairman Thomas Aquinas Murphy has warned that labor contracts that raise costs without improving productivity are " fateful mortgages upon our economic future , " and Woodcock has spoken portentously of " the final countdown " to bargaining . Yet even the sloganeering has lacked fire . For example , a U.A.W. convention early this year displayed a banner demanding REASONABLE WAGE INCREASES-hardly the battle cry of hot-eyed militants . <P> In truth , both sides have good reason to be satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' first-quarter profits amply demonstrated Detroit 's rise from the recessionary dumps : GM earned $800 million , Ford $343 million , Chrysler $72 million ( American Motors , however , suffered a $4 million loss in the most recent quarter ) . Only 30,000 workers at the four companies are still on layoff , one-tenth the number that were idle in February 1975 . The contracts signed in 1973 raised the average assembly-line worker 's wages 570 an hour and contained an unlimited cost of living adjustment ( COLA ) that has added another $1.09 . As a result , those workers now make about $6.57 an hour , a figure that other unions are scrambling unsuccessfully to match . <P> Consequently , U.A.W. leaders have talked surprisingly little about wages . Instead , they have made job security their No. 1 demand , responding to membership wishes . As one rank and filer succinctly puts it : " I got a wife and four kids . If they make sure I keep working , I 'll be happy with any contract . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
