txt With the price of gasoline heading toward $1 a gallon , many commuters in the New York metropolitan area who used to drive to work are turning to mass transit , but they are not finding enough seats on trains and buses . Throughout the country , fears bred by California 's gasoline shortage have longdistance travelers also switching to trains and buses . Amtrak says that its reservations are running 40 percent ahead of the number at this time last year , and long-distance bus lines likewise report increased traffic . In fact , Greyhound says that in some cases it is having trouble finding enough buses to handle the extra crowds . Page A17 . Although mass-transit ridership has increased in the New York City area in recent years , crowding speeded up last February when gasoline prices started their sharp rise . Transportation and government officials warn that the situation will get worse . 60 Gallons in a ** Drum " It 's getting to a point where we have a 50-gallon drum and we 're trying to put 60 gallons in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis S. Gabreski , president of the Long Island Rail Road . The L.I . R.R. reports that 4,000 daily commuters are without seats during the two rush hours every day . In Westchester County , 105 new buses have been put into service , but they have not been enough to prevent the crowding that has caused a severe standee problem . The same situation prevails on the three Conrail divisions that serve Westchester County and Connecticut ? the Hudson , Harlem and New Haven ? where , a spokesman said , " our rush-hour trains are largely filled to capacity right now , so if there was a critical increase in ridership , we would have to advise people to take off-peak trains ? before or after the rush hour . " Of all the suburbs , New Jersey seems the least affected by the increase in ridership , although many trains and buses have standees . The shift from cars is not likely to affect New York City , where perhaps 95 percent of business trips are already made with public transportation . Outlook Called Discouraging Mr. Gabreski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the lack of coaches would cause " chaos . " He said the lack was caused by " inaction over many years . " " We need 100 new cars to take care of my standees ? to give each commuter a seat , " Mr. Gabreski said . The immediate future is not bright , Mr. Gabreski said , because it would take perContinued haps five years to get new cars in service if the state , which operates the railroad through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , were to give the go-ahead tomorrow . There are now 89,000 regular commuters who make two trips a day on the Long Island , and an additional 67,000 singlefare tickets are sold each day . Ridership has been increasing in recent years , and the increase this year is running at a rate of 8 or-9 percent . The Conrail spokesman said yesterday that , the 1978 average was 240,000 daily riders ( counting each commuter as two rides and adding the single-ticket sales ) ; that the average had risen to 245,000 in January-February , and that it was near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waggoner , said that the three lines were carrying 160,000 riders a day and that there had been an annual increase of 6 or 7 percent in recent years . The Conrail lines are already short of equipment , Mr. Van Waggoner said , with a serious lack of passenger coaches . " A gas shortage would really make the need critical , " he said . In New Jersey , four lines ? the old Penn Central , the Raritan Valley , the North Jersey Coast Line and the Erie Lackawanna ? carry 150,000 commuters a day . The PATH line between NewarkJersey City and lower Manhattan carries 145,000 more . Most rush-hour trains are already crowded with standees . Jersey Has an Advantage New Jersey has an advantage over other suburban areas in that it has many bus lines , and buses can be added into service more quickly than railroad cars . There are 3,598 buses in service in the state , with 2,725 of them in use during rush hours . In New Jersey each day , 640,000 commuters ride buses serving the New York and Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state 's troubled bus system , which used to serve 1.1 million riders , could handle double the 640,000 figure , according to transportation officials , if employers could be induced to introduce staggered work hours . The 105 new buses in Westchester County cost $10.8 million , mostly in Federal funds , and , in anticipation of gasoline shortages , R. Ralph D'Adamo , the county 's Transportation Commissioner , decided to keep the buses that were replaced in storage in case they might be needed . It appears that they will be , since bus ridership in the county rose from 21 million in 1977 to 22.3 million last year and is continuing to rise , reversing a long-term decline . " More and more routes are experiencing severe standee problems , ' said Joseph J. Petrocelli , a transportation planner for the county . On Long Island , the east-west buses that bring Nassau County commuters to and from city subway terminals in Queens are crowded with standees , but the north-south lines linking areas within the county are not heavily patronized . John W. Follis , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old buses had been kept in mothballs.
