txt Senior military and diplomatic analysts said today that regardless of what part of the Soviet military establishment in Egypt had been directed to leave , one effect would be to weaken , temporarily at least , Cairo 's hope of fulfilling its repeated vow to drive Israeli forces out of the Sinai Peninsula . Another major effect , they agreed , will be to challenge Moscow either to provide more advanced arms or face the possibility of seeing a fundamental erosion of its extensive political-military investment in the Middle East , involving not only its relations with the Arab world but also its ability to contend with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean . The analysts were not certain whether Egypt was ordering only the 5,000 Soviet military advisers assigned to Egyptian gifiund and air units to leave the country , or whether the directive also applied to the 10,000 to 15,000 Russian pilots and others performing air defense missions in support of the Cairo Government and of Soviet objectives throughout the region . Few Combat Personnel Soviet combat personnel in Egypt include only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15,000 in this category include aircraft maintenance personnel , antiaircraft missile and artillery crews , base security troops and administrative personnel . The predominant view here was that only unit advisers and some technical experts helping to maintain Soviet equipment now being used by // the Egyptians were involved at this stage . But the threat to extend the withdrawal order seems im- , plicit in President Anwar el- , Sadat 's simultaneous directive that Egyptians assume control of bases and installations that up to now have been controlled exclusively by Soviet military contingents . An example , clearly , would be the Cairo West airport , from which the Russians have flown four MIG-23 planes on reconnaissance missions along the . Suez Canal , out over the Sixth Fleet and , on a few occasions , over Israeli-held territory . Tight Restrictions Enforced It has been reported by well . placed diplomatic sources in Cairo that even the chief of the Egyptian Air Force needed a pass from the Russians to set , foot on such bases in Egypt . ' That presumably will no longer be the case . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been pleading with Moscow to provide advanced weapons . She is said to be particularly eager to acquire a longer-range fighter-bomber to increase her pressure on Israel to accept a settlement under which the Suez Canal might be reopened and at least part of the Sinai returned to Egyptian control , or to gain a stronger military capacity to obtain her goals by force . The Soviet Union has supplied limited amounts of new arms . Informed sources say that about 50 ** and Sukhoi-7 fighters have been supplied this year to replace Egyptian aircraft losses incurred in training . In addition , at least 30 T-62 tanks , with a longerrange gun than on previous Soviet-supplied tanks , have been provided in recent months . But the Russians have appal , ently refused requests for more advanced fighter-bombers , such as the Sukhoi-11 . A squadron of Sukhoi-1 1 ' s is now being operated in Egypt by Soviet pilots , along with several squadrons of MIG-21 fighters , These units are believed to be stationed in the area of the Nile River Delta for defense against air attacks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been " several dozens " of flights of Soviet transport aircraft into three Soviet-controlled airfields in Egypt during May , June and July . In the light of President Sadat 's action today , analysts believe that the big transports were not carrying advanced jets for the Egyptian Air Force . Also supporting this view are recent reports from Beirut , Lebanon , that senior Soviet military men had told high military officials in Egypt and Syria that they did not know how to use effectively the modern weapons they now possessed . The Russians were said to have asserted that if there were an early resumption of war with Israel , the Arabs would probably be beaten badly . Only last week , the Egyptian Premier , Dr. Aziz Sidky , went to Moscow , reportedly for a three-day visit , to plead for advanced weapons . He returned to Cairo after one day . News reports said that his mission was regarded as a failure . Soviet advisers and technicians serving with Egyptian combat forces had been assigned to every air squadron and at least down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military analysts here . They have helped train , Egyptian troops in the use and maintenance of equipment as well as in tactics . Some Launchers Transferred In addition , Russian pilots have been flying about 60 MIG21 's and about 10 ** to provide air defense over Cairo , Alexandria and the area of the Aswan High Dam . Soviet troops have also been manning about 40 SAM-3 and 10 SAM-6 surface-to-air missile-launchers in interior regions , supported by antiaircraft artillery crews and base security troops . Some 60 SAM-2 launchers along the Suez Canal , initially operated by Soviet troops , were turned over to Egyptian crews about two years ago . As a separate mission , Soviet pilots have been flying about 10 TU-16 's , armed with long-range Kelt air-to-surface missiles , on reconnaissance missions over the American Sixth Fleet . These planes have flown from a base near Aswan . Most analysts doubt that Cairo can readily find any other country willing and able to take over the advisory and airdefense missions the Russians have been performing . The analysts feel that the Egyptians can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run into additional maintenance problems . But they say that if the air defense personnel are forced out and their advanced equipment is removed , the defense of the Egyptian interior will be markedly weakened . This would undermine Cairo 's diplomatic bargaining position and reduce Egypt 's ability to wage another round of war with Israel , they said . The Egyptian Air Force now has about 200 ** 200 MIG-15 's and ** 120 Sukoi-7 's , 26 ** and 35 Ilyshin-28 's . But intelligence sources say Egypt does not have enough experienced jet pilots to operate all the planes under her control . Israel , in comparison , has nearly 90 F-4 Phantom fighterbombers and more than 120 A-4 Skyhawk tactical bombers , and is now receiving nearly 40 more ** and 80 ** from the United States . Israel has about two experienced pilots for each plane .
