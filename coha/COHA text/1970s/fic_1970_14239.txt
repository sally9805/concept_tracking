( Center is the skeletal suggestion of a prison cell : two crude cots , a chair , a wooden box which serves as a clothes locker . An imaginary window downstage looks out on Concord Square . A Thrust extends forward , not part of the cell  --  nor are the playing areas at either side . The cell itself is raked . The cell door , imaginary , is upstage center . Surrounding the cell is the sky over Concord . There are night bird sounds , distant . Two men lie on the cots , motionless . Striped moonlight through the prison bars falls across HENRY , but the man on the other cot is in shadow . Time and space are awash here . Into a weak winter light , unrelated to the cell , an old man enters on the arm of his wife . He walks with studied erectness , using an um- brella as a cane . The wife is handsomely patrician . The old man has a shawl over his shoulders , a muffler around his neck . He stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen his wallet . ) What was his name ? LYDIAN Whose name ?

WALDO ( Vaguely . ) I keep thinking his name was David . ( Light strikes HENRY 's MOTHER as she comes into another area , also apart from the cell . She is distressed , piling disheveled hair onto the top of her head . ) MOTHER David Henry ! What have you gone and done ? ( HENRY rises on the cot . He is 29 , clean-shaven , with liquid eyes . His clothes are simple , the colors of the forest . This is a young man  --  with a knife-like humor , fierce conviction and devastating individuality . ) HENRY I have not gone and done anything , Mother . I have gone and not done something . Which very much needed the not doing . MOTHER Oh , good heavens ! ( Calling off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not done something again . HENRY ( Correcting her . ) Henry David .

HENRY I 'm myself , Mother . ( He lifts himself and sits on the edge of the cot . ) If I 'm not , who will be ? MOTHER When you 're baptized , they tell you who you are . HENRY I was n't listening . MOTHER At the christening you did n't cry once , not once . Reverend Ripley said how remarkable it was for a baby not to cry at a christening . HENRY You think I knew what they were doing to me ? MOTHER I suppose not . HENRY That 's why I did n't cry . WALDO He was the saddest happy man I ever knew . LYDIAN The happiest sad man , I think .

( He studies the umbrella affectionately , as if it were a lost old friend . ) Yes , my uh my ( But again he 's lost the name . ) Yes . ( LYDIAN helps the vague WALDO off , as the lights fall away on them. ) p. 5 MOTHER I would n't mind your being peculiar . But do you have to work at it so hard , David Henry ? HENRY Henry David . MOTHER Getting everything backward . How did you learn your letters ? HENRY Must the alphabet begin with A ? ( He stands . ) Why not with Z ? Z is a very sociable letter . Like the path of a man wandering in the woods . A is braced and solid . A is a house . I prefer Z.

" ( JOHN enters , stands beside his disturbed MOTHER . Both look at HENRY , as he sits in a Yoga-esque fixation , staring up into empty air . JOHN is taller than his brother  --  affable , more extroverted . JOHN moves smoothly , easily , in contrast to the explosively erratic movements of his younger brother. ) p. 6 MOTHER You know what David Henry 's trouble is , John ? JOHN What ?

He looks at HENRY with some amusement . ) Now here 's a rare specimen  --  WALDO ( The vital glow still upon kit face . ) There is an infinitude in the private man ! If a single man plants himself indomitably on his instincts , and there abide , the huge world will come round to him ( The light falls away on WALDO as he goes off . The light intensifies on HENRY and JOHN  --   --  the amber of sunny fields . ) HENRY ( Still squatting ; to himself. ) and there abide ! ( JOHN circles HENRY playfully , as if examining a specimen. ) p. 7 JOHN Hm ! Is this one wild or tame ? Wild , I think . Known to haunt the woods and ponds . Dull plumage . But a wise bird . Americanus something-or-other . I have it ! It is the species  --   --  BROTHER ! ! ! ( This joshing has broken HENRY 'S near-trance . He leaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! JOHN Welcome home .

And I would n't pay it . JOHN But think how Mama would love it  --   --  your diploma from Harvard , framed on the wall ! HENRY Let every sheep keep his own skin . ( JOHN gives him a disparaging shove on the shoulder , and they tussle like boys . Breathless , they sit side by side . ) John , I got more from one man  --   --  not even a professor  --   --  than I learned in four years of academic droning and snorting at Cambridge . And the strangest thing  --   --  he was n't a stranger . I knew him , I 'd seen him . You know him . You walk by him on the street , you say hello ; he 's just a man , just a neighbor .

HENRY ( Coming slowly to his feet . ) No . It 's you . And I. And God . And Mr. Emerson . And the Universal Mind ! JOHN And Aunt Louisa ? HENRY Yes , Aunt Louisa , too  --   --  false teeth and all . ( Scratching his head . ) It is n't easy to think of Aunt Louisa , swimming in the Milky Way . But that 's the way of things , I 'm sure of it . JOHN And if she ca n't keep afloat , you can dive in and save her ! ( They laugh . JOHN gets up , speaks more seriously . ) Now that you 've turned your backside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY ( Pacing about . ) Well , I think I 'll think for a while . That 'll be a change from college ! JOHN But what do you want to be ? Do you have any idea ? HENRY Yes , I know exactly . I want to be as much as possible like Ralph Waldo Emerson . ( The two brothers look at each other gravely . Light falls away from them . The light rises on WALDO and LYDIAN . He has the stature of a younger man , but he seems confused as he leafs through a manuscript. ) p. 9 LYDIAN Your lecture was splendid , dear . WALDO I think I read one paragraph twice . I lost my place . LYDIAN Nobody noticed , dear . WALDO If nobody noticed , then nobody was listening ! LYDIAN They thought you did it for emphasis . ( WALDO looks at his wife uncertainly . There is snoring from the other cell-cot . HENRY , during the WALDO-LYDIAN action , has returned to his own cot in the cell . ) WALDO ( Starts off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see that one fellow ? In the third row ? With his eyes ' closed . You do n't think he was sleeping , do you ? LYDIAN Concentrating , dear . ( Almost reassured , WALDO moves off with his wife . The snoring grows to a crescendo as the key of moonlight rises in the prison cell . HENRY rises to a sitting position on his cot , looks at his sleeping cell-partner . ) HENRY ( Gently . ) My friend  --   --  ( His fellow prisoner snorts , comes groggily awake . ) OTHER COT Huh ? Why  --   --  ? p. 10 HENRY Every human being has an inalienable right to snore . Provided it does not interfere with the inalienable right of other men to snore . ( The man on the other cot stares at him . ) I could n't hear what 's going on . OTHER COT Nothin ' goes on in here . Night half the time . Then day . Then night again . Do n't make much difference . HENRY Sshh ! ( HENRY hears with every pore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Did you hear that ? ( He comes to the imaginary downstage window . ) OTHER COT ( BAILEY ) I did n't hear nothin ' . Just a bird . HENRY ( Indignantly . ) " Just a bird " ! Can you make a cry like that ? Or feed on flowers ? Or carry the sky on your wings ? Friend , you and I ca n't even fly . ( There is a pause . BAILEY rubs his eyes . ) BAILEY ( Foggily . ) I missed part of that . Guess I 'm not full awake . HENRY ( Studying him . ) Nobody is . If I ever met a man who was completely awake , how could I look him in the face ? p. 11 BAILEY What you do to get yourself locked up ? HENRY What do you think ? BAILEY Well-l-l  --   --  a man who talks educated like you  --   --  he ca n't ' a ' done something small . Must be murder or worse . HENRY That 's what I 've done , by their lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Change . ) No . I refuse to commit murder . That 's why I 'm here . BAILEY Who they want you to kill ? HENRY Mexico . BAILEY Who 's that ? HENRY That 's where the war is . BAILEY What war ? HENRY ( Amazed , pacing . ) Friend , this cell may be the only place in the United States that 's at peace . BAILEY Who 's fighting who ? HENRY I 'm not fighting anybody . BAILEY Neither 'm I. HENRY But we 've got a President who went out and boomed up a war all by himself  --   --  with no help from Congress and less help from me. p. 12 BAILEY First I heered of it . ( Warily . ) Which side you on ? ( Pointing emphatically downstage , toward Concord . ) Are you agin ' them ? HENRY " Them " ? BAILEY Or are you one of them ? HENRY ( Thinks . ) I 'm one of Me . BAILEY That do n't make no sense . ( Far off , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downstage imagined window . ) HENRY Hear that ? Old friend of mine . He 's a night flyer . Does n't have to see where he 's going  --   --  or maybe he can see what we ca n't . Or hear ( The bird cries again . BAILEY looks at HENRY as if he were a bit daft . ) He 's headed for the pond . Did you ever make friends with a loon ? ( There is a pause . ) BAILEY Not till tonight . HENRY Any time you hear a man called " loony , " just remember that 's a great compliment to the man and a great disrespect to the loon . A loon does n't wage war , his government is perfect , being nonexistent . He is the world 's best fisherman and completely in control of his senses , thank you . ( BAILEY still is not sure about his new cellmate . ) What are you here for , friend ? p. 13 BAILEY I 'm waitin ' trial . HENRY What did you do ? BAILEY Nothin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAILEY ( Grudgingly . ) Burned down a barn . ( Defiantly . ) But I did n't do it . All I did was snuck in to get some sleep and I guess the sparks from my pipe fell in the hay and  --   --  HENRY Tell ' em that ! BAILEY The tellin ' time is the trial . That 's what I 've been waitin ' here for for three months . HENRY ( Rising in a fury . ) You 've been locked up here for three entire months , waiting for a chance to say you 're innocent ? BAILEY That 's about it . HENRY It 's outrageous ! ( Calling . ) Staples ! Sam Staples ! ( BAILEY stops him . ) BAILEY Now do n't make a ruckus . I 'm not a troublemaker . I just want to earn my keep , make a little tobakky money , and get along . HENRY " Get along " ! Those words turn my stomach . Mister  --   --  what 's your name ? p. 14 BAILEY Bailey . ( A figure crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) HENRY Mr. Bailey , listen ! What do you hear ? BAILEY Nothing  --   --  ' cept footsteps . HENRY Footsteps of what ? BAILEY A man , I guess . HENRY Where 's he walking ? BAILEY How would I know ? HENRY I know where he 's going . He 's going where he 's supposed to go . So he can be where he 's supposed to be , at the time he 's supposed to be there . Why ? So he 'll be liked . My God , a whole country of us who only want to be liked . ( Jutting his face squarely at BAILEY . ) But to be liked , you must never disagree . And if you never disagree , it 's like only breathing in and never breathing out ! A man can suffocate on courtesy . ( He paces . ) What if God wanted to be liked instead of loved ? What if the Almighty delayed every decision until He was sure it would please the majority ? Great whales might have offended some legislature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endlessly of the Common Good ! ( Vehemently . ) Common Good be damned ! Give me something magnificently uncom- mon ! p. 15 BAILEY I do n't understand what you 're sayin ' , but it 's a marvel to hear the way the words roll out ! HENRY I 'll put it in plain Anglo-Saxon , Mr. Bailey : you 're an uncommon man . You were protesting against the barn-builder who shut you in with clapboard and daily working hours . BAILEY Do n't say that to no judge ! If I burned down a barn , they 'd throw me in jail . HENRY Friend , where do you think you are ? You might as well have done the deed you did n't do ! BAILEY But I 'm not a man who goes around burning things down ! HENRY ( Thoughtfully . ) Good for you . Fire inside burns hotter than fire outside . A man 's con- viction is stronger than a flame or a bullet or a rock . ( Sinking onto the cot , thoughtfully . ) I wonder if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 'll weed my bean patch ? ( A little laugh . ) Of course , I might get some brain work done . BAILEY It feels good to talk to a smart fella . I bet you can even write . HENRY Sometimes . BAILEY I wish I was a writer . If I could write my name , I 'd die happy . p. 16 HENRY Then you 'd do better than most writers . Bailey 's not a hard name . BAILEY I know the start of it . It 's the start of the alphabet backwards . HENRY ( Stooping to the floor . ) I 'll teach you the rest ! ( A light comes up briefly on HENRY 's MOTHER . ) MOTHER Oh , David Henry 's an expert at getting things backward ! ( The light on her falls away . HENRY writes with his finger on the dust of the floor . BAILEY eagerly kneels beside him . ) HENRY B A BAILEY That 's as far as I know . HENRY Who 's Bailey ? BAILEY I am . HENRY That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BAILEY How do you write it ? HENRY ( Making a stroke in the dust . ) Simple as a beanpole . Straight up and down . " B-A-I "  --   --  there , you 're halfway through your name already . So you turn the corner  --   --  like this : ( He draws an " L. " ) That 's an " L "  --   --  B-A-I- " turn the corner . " Now . Here 's a rough one . ( He squints up at the goggle-eyed BAILEY . ) How much hair have you got ? p. 17 BAILEY Enough to comb . HENRY That 's it . Bailey needs a comb to comb his hair ! ( Drawing in the dust . ) There it is : " E " ! And when you 're all through , you want a nice tree to sit under . So you make a beanpole with branches on the top : that 's " Y " ! ( He draws it . ) And there 's your name . BAILEY Jehosophat ! You make it simple ! ( As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to HENRY for approval . ) " B-A-Beanpole-Turn the Corner-Comb-Tree . " HENRY You 've got it ! Now you can write your name ! " Bailey " ! BAILEY I 'll leave this jail an educated man ! ( Abruptly . ) You must be a teacher ! HENRY Being a teacher is like being in jail : once it 's on your record , you can never get rid of it . ( HENRY takes the chair from the cell and places it at the foremost edge of the thrust . BAILEY into shadows on his cot , rehearsing his name from the letters on the floor . HENRY becomes the young schoolmaster , addressing the audience as if they were a classroom full of unseen children . ) Students , hold your hand up in front of you , like this . ( He looks about to see that they are all doing just as he is : holding the open palm of the hand eighteen inches in front of the face . ) Is there anything between my nose and my fingers ? Nothing ? My young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whizzing back and forth , running into each other , and bouncing off ! Stars , worlds , planets , universes . Right here ! ( He blows a puff of breath into the empty space , then claps his hands together . BALL , a pompous townsman with a silver-topped cane , stakes in , listening to the end of HENRY 'S remarks to the schoolroom . ) And now  --   --  I give you a mystery ! How do we know that these particles are there ? ( HENRY flicks his other hand through the seeming emptiness in front of him. ) p. 18 BALL How indeed ? ( HENRY is startled , turns , sees the pompous visitor  --   --  then addresses the class . ) HENRY Ah , we have a surprise guest in the classroom today . The Chairman of the Concord School Committee , Deacon Nehemiah Ball . BALL I am not here to interrupt your scheduled curriculum . ( He pronounces it English-style : " sheduled . " ) HENRY Thank you , sir . These particles  --   --  BALL Just an observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting irritated . BALL folds his arms behind his back , his cane dangles tail-like behind him ; HENRY starts to speak again , but BALL@@@@@ interrupts . ) HENRY Scientists have  --   --  BALL Try to forget I 'm in the room . HENRY ( Clearing his throat . ) We 'll try , sir . ( To his class . ) Now . In recent years , scientists have discovered that  --   --  BALL How is it that I see no school books open here ? HENRY We 're huckleberrying , sir . p. 19 BALL You 're what ? HENRY We 're scrambling for ideas the way we hunt for huckleberries in the woods . BALL That 's no way to learn anything . All they need to know is clearly spelled out in the approved school texts . HENRY All , Deacon Ball ? Young Potter , here  --   --  ( Pointing to a student in the first row. )  --   --  just asked me if I really think there is a God . BALL Young heathen ! HENRY He simply asked why , since we never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Addressing Potter . ) Matters of Theology , boy , are discussable with your spiritual leader . HENRY Potter has already asked his " spiritual leader "  --   --  but the Reverend Whoever-It-Is called him an atheist ! For committing the primary sin of doubt . ( To the student . ) Mr. Potter , I 'll try to answer you just as I once replied to the same question put to me by an annoying , inquisitive young man  --   --  myself . BALL ( Narrowly . ) Will this be a theological opinion ? p. 20 HENRY ( Slowly . ) It will be a human opinion . ( Again to the student , reasonably . ) If I go into a shop and see all the nicely finished wheels , gears , pinions , springs of a watch lying spread out on a bench , then later find them put together exactly and working in unison to move the hands across a dial and show the passage of time , do I believe that these pieces have been flung together by blind chance ? Certainly not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been there . An INTELLIGENCE ! ( WALDO , in academic robes , has come to a pulpit in his area . ) WALDO An Intelligence governs the universe . And in this worship service we shall celebrate our gratitude to that Intelligence . Let us pray . ( He lowers his head , praying silently . ) HENRY Nor do I think that the sun rising above Concord this morning was an accident . I hope you saw it , Mr. Potter . And you , too , Deacon Ball . It was a brilliant sunrise . ( Emphatically . ) We are all related , Mr. Potter  --   --  and interrelated to a Universal Mind . BALL That 's atheism ! ( It is not easy for HENRY to restrain himself. ) p. 21 HENRY I 've often wondered , Deacon Ball , if atheism might even be popular with God himself . BALL ( Shocked . ) Transcendental blasphemy ! WALDO The Universal Mind is the divine part of all of us ; and we partake , knowingly or not , in the wonder of that Universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he remains at the pulpit in meditation . ) HENRY ( Softly . ) Does all this make any sense to you , Potter ? BALL It makes no sense to me . You will teach the textbooks , sir ! HENRY I find your texts somewhat behind the century . BALL You find them , so ! HENRY Yes , sir , I do ! BALL And you choose to ignore the books which have been proscribed by the School Committee ? HENRY My students have the ache of curiosity , which I 'm afraid your proscriptions will not cure ! ( There are a couple of young laughs  --   --  quickly stifled . They seem to come from the class . BALL turns stern eyes toward the imagined pupils. ) p. 22 BALL ( Imperiously . ) Silence ! You will show respect for your elders ! And you , Schoolmaster , will teach strictly according to text ! No huckleberrying ! HENRY ( After a pause . ) Class . You 've heard the Deacon . We shall stick to the approved books . Your eyes must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leaf , or an unauthorized butterfly . You must not listen to a cricket or smell a flower that has not been approved by the School Committee . You 'd better close both ears and hold your nose  --   --  though you may have to grow an extra hand to do it . ( He pantomimes the difficulty of covering successively two ears , then his nose and one ear , then the other ear and his nose . At this there is uninhibited laughter from the unseen classroom  --   --  through a loudspeaker at the foot of the thrust . ) BALL ( Waddling to the forestage . ) Silence ! Is this the gratitude you show to the municipality which feeds your minds ? ( The veins bulge in his forehead , he pounds with his silver-topped cane . ) You will show decent respect ! ( The laughter continues . BALL turns to HENRY . ) Make them be silent , sir ! ( HENRY simply lifts his hand ; the laughter stops . ) The lack of order in this classroom will most certainly be reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call into extraordinary session tonight . ( JOHN appears , speaks as if to HENRY 'S mind. ) p. 23 JOHN Henry , give the man a penny apology . Two-cents-worth of humility ! HENRY Why should I ? JOHN So they wo n't cut you off from the class . If you 're stubborn , what will happen when Potter asks questions ? ( A pause  --   --  then HENRY makes the supreme effort at contrition . He takes a deep breath , turns to face BALL . ) HENRY ( With much difficulty . ) Deacon Ball . I 'm sorry that you 've had a rather ragged time in my classroom today . I have intended no offense to you or the School Committee . BALL Well , we 've come to expect a certain degree of unruliness from Harvard men . Your apology shows that you recognize this flaw in your character . But your students do n't have Harvard as an excuse . They must be punished . HENRY I shall lecture them . BALL You will flog them ! HENRY ( Stunned . ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreverence to authority ! HENRY ( Defiantly . ) No , sir ! p. 24 BALL I beg your pardon . HENRY I said " No . " I do not believe in corporal punishment . BALL What you believe is irrelevant . Your opinion , as a teacher , has not been asked for . I direct you to FLOG ! ( HENRY hesitates . ) HENRY Why ? BALL It is policy . Offending students are whipped . HENRY And what would that teach them ? BALL Obedience . An essential quality in subordinates , whether they are pupils in a classroom or soldiers on a battlefield . HENRY They are not training to be soldiers . Not my students . BALL These young people are not yours . They have been sent to you by the tax-paying citizens of Concord , who expect you to abide by the rules laid down by the school administrators . ( Silence . HENRY does not move . ) Perform your duty , Schoolmaster Thoreau , if you expect to retain your post in this community . ( HENRY slowly unbuckles his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step toward BALL , who pulls back , thinking perhaps HENRY is about to flog him . Then HENRY turns front , to the class. ) p. 25 HENRY ( Bitterly , to his class . ) Six of you . Any six . Come forward . It does n't matter who . You arc all  --   --  all of you  --   --  accused of the damning crimes of laughter , curiosity , and candid self-expression ! Bigelow ! ( HENRY grabs the chair , spins it over as if he were putting a boy across his knee . Eyes closed , HENRY lashes the chair fiercely and painfully with his belt . ) Coleman ! ( Again he lashes the chair . ) Loring ! ( Another lash . ) McClainl ( He whips the chair again , blindly , loathing what he is doing . ) Henderson . ( Another lash . Then a hesitation . ) Potter ! ( This whipping is the most painful of all . He turns his head away . Now finished , breathless , HENRY opens his eyes , stares at the belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flings it away from him , far offstage . ) BALL I congratulate you . I am happy to be able to report to the School Committee that Schoolmaster Thoreau  --   --  HENRY  --   --  has administered the Sacrament of the Schoolroom ; and he resigns as a " teacher " in the Public Schools of Concord ! ( BALL icily falls back into the shadows and disappears . The light on the pulpit comes up in full brilliance on WALDO. ) p. 26 WALDO ( In the midst of an inner struggle. )  --   --  but I can not comply with custom ! I can not perform the rites required of me by this congregation . For I have searched the Scriptures and can find nothing which calls on us to repeat endlessly the ceremony of the Last Supper . Intellectually , emotionally , spiritually , I can not administer this Sacrament . So I resign my position as pastor of the Second Unitarian Church of Boston . ( HENRY has put the chair  --   --  his " student "  --   --  back in the jail cell . Sadly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never teach again . WALDO I shall never preach again .

( JOHN notices the disconsolate HENRY and goes to him . ) JOHN ( Quietly . ) A school does n't need a School Committee . Or Trustees . Or Governors . Or Lumber . Or approved textbooks . All a school needs is a mind that sends , and minds that receive . HENRY Nobody can teach anybody anything . p. 27 JOHN ( Blithely . ) Of course not . Teach them how to teach themselves . HENRY ( Fired with an idea . ) Our own school , John . No buildings . Break out of the classroom prison . All we need is sky ! ( The cyclorama becomes ablaze with blue , and sunlit clouds .

Did you ever have any idea so much was going on in Hey wood 's Meadow ? I 'll wager even Hey wood does n't know . ( A discovery . ) The cypripedium is already in flower ! ( He leafs back through his notebook . ) Last year it did n't bloom until tomorrow ! ( He makes an entry in his notebook . ) Do ' you know how few people know what we 've just discovered ?

Not so much as a prince in disguise . ( Looking sideways at his brother . ) John , are you a prince in disguise ? p. 28 JOHN Of course . ( HENRY paces about the meadow . ) HENRY Would n't it be dreadful if I had lived in the Golden Age as a hired man ? Or visited Olympus , and fell asleep after dinner  --   --  and completely missed the conversation of the gods . Or imagine living in Judea eighteen hundred years ago  --   --  and never knowing that Jesus was my contemporary ! What are you doing ? ( He has , in his peripatetic outpouring , come face-to-face with the girl , who has taken out a notebook ; she is absorbed in writing , jarred by his question . ) ELLEN I 'm writing . HENRY What ?

JOHN ( Taking a good look at her . ) I would n't mind . Would you ? p. 29 HENRY ( Crossing back to her . ) Excuse me , Miss . But I think you 're a little old to be a member of this class . JOHN Henry , a young lady is never too old for anything . HENRY It 's just that  --   --  well  --   --  most of our students are twelve  --   --  or thereabouts .

I 've interrupted . HENRY Of course you have . Every creative event that ever happened in the world was an interruption . Unexpected . Unplanned for . The only people who ever get anyplace interesting are the people who get lost . That 's why the planets are so much better company than the stars  --   --  they keep wandering back and forth across the sky and you never know where you 're going to find them . ( To the unseen class . ) Students . We have another Sewell . Edmund 's sister . ( To the girl . ) You have a first name ? ELLEN Ellen . p. 31 HENRY Ellen Sewell . Our textbook , Miss Sewell , is Heywood 's Meadow . Approved by the Almighty , if not by the School Committee . ( To the class . ) In this single pasture , there are three hundred distinct and separate varieties of grass . I know ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say : " That 's grass . Grass is grass . " Ridiculous . You have missed the splendid variety of the show . There 's camel grass , candy grass , cloud grass , cow-quake , mouse-barley , fox-tail , London-lace , devil 's knitting needle , feather-top , buffalo grass , timothy and barnyard grass and clovers enough to sweeten the bellies of all the lambs since creation . ( ELLEN has taken down her notebook and is writing . Suddenly HENRY leans down , seeing something , and plucks an imaginary blade of grass . ) John , look at this . What would you say it is ? JOHN I 've never seen it before . HENRY It 's Coix Lacryma-jobi , which means Job 's Tears . I 've never seen a specimen here . Students , I beg your pardon . We are in the midst of three hundred and one varieties of God-made grasses . ( He jots this information in his notebook . Out of the corner of his eye , he sees ELLEN writing . ) You 're writing again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY Why ? ELLEN When you go to school , you 're supposed to write things down , so you remember what you 've been taught . HENRY Then it 's the notebook that does the remembering , not you . ELLEN You keep a notebook . HENRY I also wear a ridiculous straw hat . That does n't mean that you should wear a ridiculous hat . You 'd look ridiculous in it . Nature did n't stuff this meadow full of identical blades of grass , each an imitation of another . They 're all different ! Follow-the-leader is not the game we 're playing here ! Young lady , BE YOUR OWN MAN ! JOHN ( Low . ) Henry , do n't shout at her . ELLEN I wo n't take notes . I promise you . Not one . HENRY Why not ? If you want to take notes , go ahead . But not because I 'm doing it , or because I told you to . ( Gently . ) Miss Sewell , I want you to be yourself  --   --  not your idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . ( Turning to the students . ) Perhaps , students , Miss Sewell 's interruption has given us the essence of the textbook we call Heywood 's Meadow . The multiple grasses beneath our feet . The infinity of the sky above us . ( Riffling through his notebook . ) And if have jotted down a note about a cloud-flame , or about sunlight on bird-wings , do n't you write , just because I am writing . Do n't ape me , or copy me . ( Intensely , but quietly . ) If you wish merely to listen to the sky , or smell the sky , or feel the sky with your finger-tips , do that , too ! ( With great conviction . ) Because I think there should be as many different persons in the world as possible . So  --   --  each of you  --   --  be very careful to find out and pursue your own way ! ( As the lights dim on the sunlit field , HENRY goes back to the dimly-lit cell. ) p. 33 BAILEY ( Rapturously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Watch ! Watch me do it all by myself  --   --  ! ( BAILEY starts again to trace his name in the dust on the cell floor . HENRY bitterly erases the pattern of letters in the dust with his foot . BAILEY looks up , puzzled . ) HENRY Do n't learn to write your name . BAILEY I already learned . HENRY ( Splenetic . ) Unlearn it . Writing your name can lead to writing sentences . And the next thing you 'll be doing is writing paragraphs , and then books . And then you 'll be in as much trouble as I am ! BAILEY ( Wonderingly . ) You write books ? ( HENRY sits on the cot . ) HENRY ( Wryly . ) Yes . BAILEY If my mother 'd lived to see me sittin ' in the same jail cell with a man who writ a book , ohhhh-ee , she 'd be proud of me . Tell me somethin ' . Do you make up all the words yourself ? HENRY Oh , now and then I stick in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base trick is to pick the right words and put ' em in the right order . p. 34 BAILEY Must be a fortune in it . I hear tell some books cost more'n a dollar ! HENRY But they have n't been perfected yet . They 've got ta put legs on them . As it is now , a book just sits in a shop and has to wait for somebody with legs on to come in and find it . BAILEY ( Blankly . ) Oh ? ( BAILEY has fallen tobacco from his rough coat in the locker , thus freeing the box for the next scene . ) HENRY My first book  --   --  also my last book  --   --  was a very stationary model . The publisher brought out a thousand copies !  --   --  and gave me the privilege of paying for the printing . So all the copies that did n't sell belonged to the author . And they came running home to me , legs or not . ( Gravely . ) Right now , Mr. Bailey , I have a library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which I wrote myself . ( Pointing to the scuffed-up letters in the dust of the floor . ) My friend , give up your literary career . ( Suddenly , HENRY takes the locker-box from the cell , flips it over , open-side up , and drags it down onto the thrust . JOHN comes on , helping him with the " boat . " ) p. 35 HENRY John , today I thought we 'd make a complete circuit of the pond . If this boat is n't large enough for the whole class , I 'll take the first trip , you take the second . JOHN It 'll be large enough . HENRY We lost another pupil ? JOHN No . We lost two . HENRY ( Defensively . ) Good . Education should not be a mass process ! JOHN With us , it is n't . HENRY The whole idea of our school is that the size of the classroom grows larger and larger  --   --  JOHN  --   --  while the size of the class grows smaller and smaller . HENRY How many do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Mother 's got the name of a new family , just moved to Concord . HENRY How many children ? JOHN Be patient , Henry . The wife is pregnant . ( JOHN starts to leave . ) HENRY Where are you going ? JOHN Back to the pencil factory . p. 36 HENRY Why ? JOHN It might be a little overpowering  --   --  to have twice as many teachers as pupils . HENRY Only one left ? ( JOHN goes off . HENRY , alone , scowls , kicks at the box-boat . ELLEN appears . ) ELLEN Mr. Thoreau  --   --  ? ( HENRY turns . ) HENRY Good morning  --   --  ELLEN I  --   --  I came to tell you that you should n't wait for Edmund . Just go ahead and start the class without him . He  --   --  uh  --   --  wo n't be coming today . HENRY I hope he 's not ill ? ELLEN No . ( Pause . ) It 's my Father  --   --  HENRY He 's ill ? ELLEN Not exactly . Father 's worried  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's good news . I thought Edmund was a bit sluggish myself . Compared with the other students . That is , when we had other students to compare him with . ( Briskly . ) Well , tell your Father not to worry . I 'll slow down with Edmund . p. 37 ELLEN I 'm afraid Father does n't want him to come to your school at all any more . HENRY ( Bridling . ) Oh . Your Father 's opposed to knowledge . ELLEN No . He 's opposed to Transcendentalists . That 's what he says you are . And your brother , too . " A whole family afflicted with Transcendentalism . " HENRY What the devil does your Father think Transcendentalism is ? ELLEN I asked him and he tried to explain it to me . And the more he explained , the less I understood it . Father has a gift that way . HENRY A born non-teacher . ( Suddenly . ) Miss Sewell . Get into the boat . ELLEN Oh ? HENRY Since I find myself unexpectedly unemployed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No tuition charge . ( HENRY helps her into the boat . ) Keep your eye on the line between the water and the sky . I 'll row . ( He pantomimes pushing the boat off ; the light narrows , the background trembles with the wavering pattern of sunlight reflected from water . With no visible oars , he rows . Suddenly , he points . ) There used to be a row of cedars on that far shore . ( Sighing . ) But we have lost that link with Lebanon . p. 38 ELLEN Where have they gone ? HENRY Into firewood  --   --  and up in smoke . Into houses . Do you know what we 're doing , Miss Sewell ? We 're poisoning paradise . Shearing off the woods , making the poor earth bald before her time . ELLEN But we have to have houses , Mr. Thoreau . Or should we all live in caves ? HENRY What 's the use of a house if you have n't got a tolerable planet to put it on ? Did you know that trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard them . But what bells in town toll for them ? We prosecute men for abusing children ; we ought to prosecute them for maltreating nature . ELLEN My father says God put everything here for men to use . HENRY Oh ? Did the Good Father put us here to root and snort and glut ourselves like pigs ? No , the pigs are better ; pigs may be the most respectable part of the population : at least they consume the rubble instead of contributing to it . ( In the distance , the whistle of a railroad train . ) Hear that ? There goes a carload of two-legged pigs , off to market emasculating the landscape with their tracks ELLEN I rather like the railroad . Far better than a horse and carriage . p. 39 HENRY Why ? ELLEN It 's smoother , and much faster . HENRY And dirtier . And uglier . Thank God men have n't learned to fly : they 'd lay waste the sky as well as the earth chop down the clouds ! ELLEN ( Somewhat puzzled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Laughs . ) No . Yes , it is  --   --  in a way . Take your father . Do you love the man ? ELLEN Of course . HENRY Why ? ELLEN He 's my father . HENRY Is he beautiful ? ELLEN Dear me , no ! HENRY Does he create beauty ? Paint ? Play a musical instrument ? ELLEN No . HENRY ( Pointing up , then down . ) Can he fly like that bird ? Or swim , like that fellow down there ? ELLEN He canswim a little . He used to . But not like that fish . HENRY Nevertheless you love him . p. 40 ELLEN Of course . HENRY Your love transcends what your father is  --   --  and what he is not . Every consciousness is capable of going beyond itself . Every  --   --  ( ELLEN frowns a bit . ) Dammit , I 've lost you . Put your hand in the water . ( She does . ) Can you touch bottom ? ELLEN ( Reaching down . ) It 's too deep . HENRY For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your mind . ( He has stopped rowing . ) Miss Sewell . Why should your reach stop with your skin ? When you transcend the limits of yourself , you can cease merely living  --   --  and begin to BE ! ELLEN I do n't mind living  --   --  HENRY But being is so much more interesting . ELLEN ( Taking her hand out of the " water . " ) I 'm a little bit afraid  --   --  just  --   --  to " be " ! HENRY Think how free it is . If you 're never afraid . ELLEN Are n't you ever afraid ? ( He things , stares at her. ) p. 41 HENRY Yes . I 'm afraid that I might " live " right through this moment  --   --  and only live  --   --  ( He leans forward on his oars , looking into her face. )  --   --  look at you and only see you . Oh , it does n't hurt at all to look at you , believe me . But what if there 's more .  --   --  . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What if all that is beautiful , in women , in the world  --   --  or worlds  --   --  what if all of it is totaled up in this face here , in front of me  --   --  and I am empty enough to think I am merely seeing one face ? ( ELLEN does n't follow him precisely , but she 's pleased . ) ELLEN That 's Transcendentalism ? ( HENRY has lost interest in Transcendentalism and is more interested in ELLEN . ) HENRY ( Resumes rowing . ) If you like . ELLEN I do n't think that 's wicked . I think it 's rather nice . HENRY Who says it 's wicked ? ELLEN Father . Last night at the dinner table , Edmund gave Father a sermon on the Over-Soul. p. 42 HENRY Good for Edmund ! Most dining rooms are tabernacles where only the father gets the pulpit . ELLEN Oh , Father got it right back . He was still shouting at breakfast . He broke off with an incomplete sentence last night , and picked it right up this morning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Edmund . But I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable advice from my seniors . ( His eyes going to the horizon . ) We are born as innocents . We are polluted by advice . Here is life in front of us , like the surface of this pond , inviting us to sail on it . A voyage , an experiment . Waiting to be performed . Has your father tried-it-before ? That 's no help to me . Or to you . Keep your innocence , Edmund ! ELLEN Ellen . HENRY Ellen , yes . You look very much alike , you know . The eyes . You both listen with your eyes . ELLEN I have to go back . HENRY Why ? ELLEN Father expects me . HENRY Surprise him . ELLEN Edmund did . He 's braver than I am . HENRY Stand up to your father ! ( He stands . The boat rocks. ) p. 43 ELLEN Please , Mr. Thoreau  --   --  not in the boat ! HENRY Oh  --   --  ( He sits . ) ELLEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY No . Listen to me . If I were to say , " I Love You , Sewell  --   --  Miss Sewell . Ellen "  --   --  you would n't think much of it as a statement of fact if you knew it was just an echo , a mouthing , of something somebody told me to say . ( Disparagingly . ) Some father ! ( Quietly . ) But if I say " I love you " out of myself , out of my own experience  --   --  or lack of it  --   --  out of my innocence , then you and God had better believe me . ( The light comes up on JOHN and MOTHER , as ELLEN turns away from HENRY , staring at the water . ) JOHN ( Running in . ) Mother , Henry 's in love . MOTHER ( Worried . ) Who 's he in love with ? JOHN A girl . MOTHER Thank God . ( Light falls away on JOHN and MOTHER. ) p. 44 ELLEN ( Icily . ) I 'm not one of your fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can neither swim nor fly back to dry land . I must simply sit here and hope that you are gentleman enough to row me ashore . ( HENRY does n't move . He looks at her . She 's beautiful , but he knows he 's missed his chance , and it frustrates him . ) HENRY ( With a sigh . ) Miss Sewell . I apologize . And I 'll row you to shore on one condition . ELLEN I have to accept it . HENRY Come to church on Sunday . ELLEN You do n't go to church . HENRY Of course not . I ca n't stand sitting in a pew , having the Sabbath despoiled by a sermon . ELLEN But still you invite me to church ? HENRY With John . We have a strong family resemblance , too . And if you find a single syllable in me worth writing in a notebook , you 'll find paragraphs of it in John ! Where I am cantankerous , he is amiable . Where I am thorns and brambles , he is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is spring . ( He begins to row , slowly. ) p. 45 ELLEN How do you know that your brother would want to take me to church ? HENRY Did n't you notice that day in Heywood 's Meadow  --   --  when he proposed to you ? ELLEN He barely spoke to me . HENRY That 's why you did n't hear him . You missed the eloquence of his silence . ( The boat presumably comes to shore . HENRY jumps out , pantomimes pulling it onto the bank , then helps ELLEN as she steps out . ELLEN , having won her point , wonders have 1 really lost ? ) ELLEN ( With mixed pride and regret . ) Good day , Mr. Thoreau . Thank you for making Transcendentalism so clear . HENRY Did I ? If there 's anything I missed , just ask Edmund . ELLEN What will happen to your school ? HENRY ( Turning away . ) I 'm going back to it . As a pupil . Maybe I can learn from Nature  --   --  and from John : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a single sound . But a man  --   --  presumably wiser than a daffodil  --   --  can beat so loudly on the eardrums that nobody hears what he 's trying to say . ( ELLEN is bewildered . Then , in his silence , HENRY seems almost fierce to her , and she runs off , frightened . He looks wistfully toward the air where ELLEN was . Then he stares down into the empty boat , kicks it . That emptiness is something of the vacancy he feels within himself . Slowly , HENRY moves up into the area of the jail cell . The wavering pattern of light-on-water falls away . Only the long nocturnal shadows of the cell remain . BAILEY is asleep on his cot , snoring lightly . HENRY looks down at him. ) p. 46 HENRY Mr. Bailey , what do you think of marriage ? ( BAILEY gives out a derisive snore , which suggests that subconsciously he may have heard the question . HENRY nods . ) That seems to be the majority opinion . ( He settles back on his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , louder and louder , pulsing with standing waves . ) Bailey , did you hear that ? I do n't think I 've ever felt those waves of sound from the clock tower . ( A laugh . ) That 's ridiculous  --   --  that a man has to be put in a stone box before he can hear the music of his own village ! ( HENRY calls through the barred window . ) Thank you , Concord ! Thank you for locking me up so I 'm free to hear what I 've never heard before . You put me behind iron bars and walls four feet thick ! How do you know that I 'm not the free one ? The freest man in the world ! And you , out there , are chained to what you have to do tomorrow morning ! ( Now he whispers through the cell grating . ) Speak softly , Concord  --   --  I can hear you breathing . ( BAILEY lets out a snore . ) Quiet , Bailey . We free men should listen to the cry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is the projection of a stained glass window . Facing upstage is a standing row of worshipers : DEACON BALL , SAM STAPLES , WALDO , LYDIAN , MRS . THOREAU , JOHN and ELLEN beside him , and townspeople . All are dressed Sunday-best and singing the last stanza of a hymn : " Blest Be the Tie that Binds , " Pilgrim Hymnal 272. ) p. 47 CHURCHGOERS ( Singing in unison . ) Blest be the tie that bindsOur hearts in Christian love ; The Fellowship of kindred mindsIs like to that Above.A-men . ( Halfway through the hymn , EDWARD scratches his bottom . LYDIAN pulls his hand away . After the " Amen " there is the swell of organ music , as the worshipers begin to file out into the tree-dappled light of a Sunday noon . ELLEN comes out , on JOHN 'S arm . There is a cluster of conversation around the EMERSONS . ) BALL Tell me , Doctor Emerson . What is the feeling of a clergyman when he hears another pastor in the pulpit ? WALDO Relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? WALDO ( Drily . ) That it 's over . ( The MOTHER is beaming at JOHN and ELLEN . Suddenly she sees something which turns her soul to ice . The others look , with varying degrees of shock , as HENRY , his shirt unbuttoned , pushes a wheelbarrow full of earth . Blithely he crosses directly in front of the washed and starched churchgoers . ELLEN looks down , JOHN suppresses a grin , WALDO and LYDIAN turn gracefully away , and DEACON BALL tries to look as much as possible like Moses on the mountain. ) p. 48 MOTHER Oh , David Henry ! Not on Sunday ! HENRY ( Pleasantly . ) This is Sunday , is n't it . Have all of you been shut up inside ? On this beautiful morning ? What a pity ! BALL We 've been feeding our souls ! HENRY How selfish of you . ( He reaches into the wheelbarrow and sprinkles some of the unseen contents at the feet of the churchgoers . ) I 've been feeding the flora of Concord . ( They wince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lilacs . ( Waving cheerfully , HENRY trundles the wheelbarrow off . All eyes follow him . ) BALL Labor on the Sabbath , and the Devil 's in Massachusetts . JOHN Henry worships in the woods . BALL Then what do we have churches for ? WALDO I sometimes wonder . LYDIAN ( Quickly . ) Dr. Emerson means that the Good Lord is everywhere . BALL The Lord I know rested on the Seventh Day . WALDO Why , Deacon Ball , you 're older than I thought ! ( Before BALL can really take offense , the warm-hearted EMERSON pats his shoulder . ) For you and me , Deacon , the Declaration of Independence has already been written . Young Thoreau has to declare it every day  --   --  Sundays included . ( Starting off , with LYDIAN . ) So what 's the harm if he sweats his psalms instead of singing them ? ( The worshipers disperse . JOHN and ELLEN go off together . MRS . THOREAU is left alone . SHE looks off toward the vanished HENRY. ) p. 49 MOTHER Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to make you so peculiar ? ( Eyes to heaven . ) And please , dear Lord , do n't let John get too strange . Perhaps , if it is n't too much trouble , you could slip the word " yes " into that young lady 's mouth . Amen . ( She goes off . The stained glass window fades . The cyclorama becomes sunlit clouds . Amplified and echoing , JOHN 'S laughter spills across the open field . HENRY comes on , takes a triumphant stance . ) HENRY She said " Yes ! ! ! " ( JOHN bursts on , almost drunk with his own laughter . ) Congratulations  --   --  I 'm happy for you , John ! Are you going to do it right away ? Or do you have to go through those tribal rites  --   --  posting the banns , all that primitive nonsense ? ( JOHN , in a paroxysm of laughter , embraces his brother . ) JOHN She said  --   --  she said  --   --  ( He breads off again , laughing . ) HENRY She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , ca n't answer . ) She did n't say " No ! " ? JOHN No , she did n't say " No ! " HENRY What the devil did she say ? p. 50 JOHN ( Still laughing . ) She quoted her father . HENRY Heavenly or here ? JOHN The one her mother married . HENRY Well , what did old Porridge-Face have to say ? JOHN He said  --   --  ( Laughing . ) She said he said that marriage to either of the Thoreau brothers was unthinkable ! HENRY Amen ! The Thoreau brothers never had any intention of marrying her father ! ( Hopefully . ) But she stood up to him ? JOHN I was n't there  --   --  but evidently she sat down . ( He sits . ) HENRY So you wasted six good summer Sundays taking her to church ! JOHN I swear to you , I did n't pray . I kept looking at that face out of the corner of my eye . Wondering what she was thinking . I finally realized she was n't thinking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a wife who went around thinking ? JOHN ( Starts laughing again . ) When I asked her to marry me , there was a pregnant pause . Well , not pregnant , but a pause . Then she said : " Oh , dear " At first , I thought she was being affectionate , then I realized she was only saying , " Oh , dear ! " p. 51 HENRY Then what ? JOHN Then she said , " Why does n't Henry ask me ? " And I said , " If he does , will you say yes ? " And she said , " No , but why does n't he ask me anyhow ? " HENRY It 's an outrage ! She wants to wear both of our scalps on her petticoat strings ! JOHN She wo n't marry you , and she wo n't marry me . But I think she 'd marry us in a minute . HENRY That 's carrying Unitarianism too far ! JOHN If we were Mohammedans  --   --  HENRY Would n't help . Moslems take multiple wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I destroyed the whole thing . I killed it . I laughed . ( HENRY laughs a little . ) Not like that . Bigger ! ( They both begin to laugh . ) Not at her , ' the dear girl ; at us ! I almost shattered the most sacred tradition of the Thoreau tribe : celibacy ! HENRY ( Laughing . ) You 're a good-hearted man , John ! You saved the girl from marrying a monk . JOHN Or a pair of them ! ( They laugh more heartily. ) p. 52 HENRY Who in our brood has ever committed marriage ? JOHN Mama and Papa . HENRY Only legally . Except for a couple of slips that brought about you and me , Papa is pure bachelor and Mama is a living pillar of spinsterhood . Thanks to your courageous inaction , the Thoreaus remain a race of maiden aunts and bachelors . All of us , December Virgins ! JOHN Henry , I never told you about one April  --   --  ( HENRY lifts one hand in mock forgiveness . ) HENRY Boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They laugh together , then grow serious . ) JOHN It makes for a rather lonely-looking future . HENRY Lonely ? Never ! Why , when I 'm ninety and you 're a mere infant of eighty-eight , you 'll come around and comfort me . JOHN When you 're ninety , Henry , I 'll be a " mere infant " of ninety-two . ( HENRY grasps his brother 's hand . ) HENRY And that 's the time we 'll both go after the hand of Ellen Sewell ! ( HENRY and JOHN leap about , laughing , as if they were a pair of nonagenarians who have been injected with " youth-juice . " Then they fall into each other 's arms , laughing helplessly . The light goes black . In utter darkness , the church-bell tolls mournfully . Dimly the stained glass window of the church appears . Then a cold white spot , directly above , strikes the box which was the boat and has now been turned over to become a coffin. ) p. 53 VOICE OF MINISTER Unto Almighty God we commend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we commit his body to the ground , in the sure and certain hope of the Resurrection unto Eternal Life . Let us pray . ( Four blacks-coated townspeople carry off the casket . The MOTHER in black . HENRY comes slowly to her side . She looks into his face . ) MOTHER David Henry . Pray with me ! ( MOTHER kneels , facing front . Almost life a sleep-walker , HENRY sinks to his knees . His face is mask-like . His MOTHER clasps her hands . Automatically HENRY does the same . ) MOTHER ( With difficulty . ) Our Father , which art in Heaven , hallowed be  --   --  ( She breaks off , looks at her silent son , who has lowered his hands . ) HENRY I ca n't , Mother . I ca n't pray . MOTHER It helps . HENRY Does it ? I prayed before . What good did it do ? MOTHER We should pray for John 's soul . HENRY John 's soul can take care of itself . MOTHER We should pray for understanding  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY I understand ! God has stopped listening , Mother  --   --  if He ever did listen . What kind of God would fail to see the godliness in John ? I ca n't pray to Him . ( HENRY turns away , then comes back , pisses his MOTHER 'S head . Quietly : ) Mother . Pray for both your sons . ( The MOTHER lowers her head , praying as she moves off . The stained-glass projection fades . ELLEN hurries on . ) ELLEN ( Sympathetically . ) What Happened ? HENRY ( Shrugs . ) He died . ELLEN I was in Winthrop . I did n't even hear about it until after the funeral . HENRY We managed . ELLEN How did  --   --  did n't anybody know , beforehand  --   --  ? HENRY What do you want , a medical report ? To feed a morbid curiosity ? ELLEN Even though I could n't marry him  --   --  HENRY Could n't you ? Well , that 's your business . ELLEN Henry , do n't be so selfish with your sorrow ! I care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like the Knights of the Table Round who slashed at each other with rusty swords until they had all died of blood-poisoning . ELLEN I do n't understand . HENRY John , three mornings ago , happened to think of something very funny while he was shaving . He burst out laughing , and cut himself . The razor was old , and vicious , and it despised the blood in his veins . And so  --   --  ( Confronting her fiercely )  --   --  would you like the details ? The spasms , the retching , the murderous ineptitude of doctors , the paralysis of the tongue , the choking , the clamping of the jaw , the blood-black face , the eyes pleading for oxygen , the  --   --  ( HENRY suddenly is seized with the symptoms of psychosomatic lock-jaw , and seems to be going through his brother 's agony . ) ELLEN ( Aghast . ) Henry !

But a nick in the finger from a dull razor  --   --  what an indignity ! What kind of God would drain away such youth and energy and laughter ! A sneak attack from the Almighty . ( Turning his face to the sky . ) You plagued Job , but you spared him ! Why could n't you have been as fair with John ? ( ELLEN moves toward him , wants to touch him , to comfort him  --   --  but she doesn't. ) p. 56 ELLEN I wonder if  --   --  if God lets us be hurt  --   --  so we can learn to transcend the pain ? ( She speaks very softly and simply . ) In the boat , I did n't understand , really . But is it possible , Henry , that  --   --  even though he 's stopped living , John continues to be ?

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WALDO , seated , presumably in his study . LYDIAN stands behind him .

WALDO And what about your head ? HENRY It could be useful . For burrowing , perhaps . ( LYDIAN laughs . ) I could beat it into a ploughshare . It might be a better tool than it 's been for thinking . WALDO You 're giving up thinking ? HENRY For this lifetime , yes . p. 57 WALDO ( Turning to his wife . ) We could certainly use a handyman , Lydian . ( To HENRY . ) Mrs. Emerson will assure you that , of all God 's creatures , I am the least handy of men . My skill at carpentry stops at cutting cheese .

HENRY Well , I was a child once myself . Briefly . LYDIAN ( To WALDO . ) It would be so good for Edward  --   --  to have someone who could take him boating and hiking . ( To HENRY . ) Dr. Emerson has so little time to be a father  --   --  he 's so occupied with his lectures and writing . p. 58 HENRY When I 'm with your son , Dr. Emerson , I might turn my brain back on  --   --  temporarily .

And more valuable . The words you fling into an audience from the lecture platform  --   --  you never know what happens to them , do you ? No more than a Roman Emperor knew what happened to the coins he scattered to the crowd as he rode through the streets . WALDO The Roman Emperors were trying to buy popularity . HENRY And the poor fellows only had gold . No wonder Rome fell ! ( Growing more intense . ) But I sat on the grass at Harvard Yard and heard you speak for the first time . I was at the very edge of the assembly  --   --  but I think I caught more coins than the crowd at the wheels of your chariot . WALDO ( To LYDIAN . ) This may be interesting , having a Harvard man as a handyman . ( To HENRY . ) I 'm vain , you know . Of necessity . I 'm not as lucky as the Caesars ; I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his desk and doubts constantly : is it gold or is it tin ? p. 59 HENRY I apologize . It was a faulty metaphor . Money is merely money . You can never spend a thought . It still belongs to you  --   --  though it makes other men rich ! WALDO ( Accusingly . ) You 're thinking , Mr. Thoreau . Incidentally , if we 're going to have you around here  --   --  you , and your hands , and your head  --   --  I ca n't possibly go on calling you " Mr. Thoreau . " Your mother calls you " David , " I believe ? HENRY I call myself " Henry . " WALDO ( Drily . ) My mother called me " Ralph . " You may call me " Waldo . " ( They laugh and shake hands . ) And Lydian , of course , is " Lydian . " And Edward  --   --  where 's Edward ? ( Calls . ) Edward ! LYDIAN It 's important , I think , for you to meet Edward . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they be ? ( EDWARD comes on . He is eight , and has the shyness and reserve of the son of a famous father . ) EDWARD ( Reporting to his father . ) Yes , sir ? WALDO A firm handshake , Edward , for Mr. Thoreau . ( EDWARD and HENRY shake hands . ) You 're going to be extremely good friends . p. 60 HENRY ( Easily , but not glibly . ) I do n't see why not . EDWARD ( Stiffly . ) How do you do , sir . ( EDWARD is cautious in his friendships . ) LYDIAN Is n't it nice , Edward  --   --  having a new member of the family ? EDWARD ( Obediently . ) Yes , ma'am . LYDIAN ( To her husband . ) But we ca n't expect Henry to work for the same munificent salary we pay Edward  --   --  which is nothing . WALDO Not true . Every Saturday morning , wet or fair , Edward gets a shiny new dime . EDWARD ( Surprised . ) I do ? WALDO Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( With a faint smile . ) Some weeks he 's overpaid .

Back to your studies . p. 61 EDWARD Yes , Father . ( The boys scoots off . ) HENRY ( Watching the boy go . ) If it will make you feel better , I 'll take the same pay as Edward  --   --  and try to be worth it . WALDO Henry , you 're not a very good businessman . HENRY I 'm not a businessman at all . If you do n't pay me a regular salary , then I wo n't feel obliged to keep regular hours . I love a broad margin to my life ( Quickly . ) But I assure you , the work will be done . WALDO Then you must have weekly wages HENRY But must it be money ? Could it be  --   --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projection and the distant music of a flute . HENRY pauses to hear it . WALDO and LYDIAN stare at him strangely , as he stares way off , toward Walden , far in the back of the auditorium or beyond . ) How far does it extend , your back meadow ? WALDO To the woods . HENRY Including the woods ? WALDO A section of it . To the shore of the pond . ( The flute music rises , accelerates : the idea is accelerating inside his head. ) p. 62 HENRY Perhaps , some day , if my work has been useful to you , and if we remain friends , I may ask you for a bit of your woods  --   --   --  ( Quickly . ) A small square , no bigger than this room . Not as a gift , I do n't want to own it ! Simply an understanding between friends  --   --  who know that the land really belongs to the woodchucks , anyhow ! LYDIAN What will you do with it ? HENRY I 'm not quite sure . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flute melody lingers , then falls away , as does the leafy projection . ) WALDO Good thinking , Henry . You 're planning ' way up ahead , for your retirement . HENRY Retirement ? What an absurd idea ! Why spend the best part of your life earning money so that you can enjoy a questionable liberty during the least valuable part of it ? Why work like a dog so you can pant for a moment or two before you die ? ( WALDO laughs . ) WALDO Carlyle told me about an Englishman who went off to India  --   --  " Injah , " he called it  --   --  to make a huge fortune so that he could come back to the Lake Country and live the life of a poet . p. 63 HENRY If there was a poem in him , he should have rushed straight up to his garret . WALDO He should have ! He died in the Punjab  --   --  immensely wealthy , but without a sonnet to his name . LYDIAN Can Henry have his parcel of woods ? For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what kind of experiment you have in mind . But if the woodchucks do n't object , why should I ? HENRY Thank you , Doctor  --   --  uh  --   --  ( Corrects himself. )  --   --  Waldo . WALDO ( To his wife . ) I do n't really have time to make a list of all the things that need doing . Lydian , could you go into the details with Henry  --   --  various things that  --   --  HENRY Do n't make a list . Things will tell me what needs to be done . WALDO Oh , what a relief ! The hell of having people help you is that they are constantly completing what you gave them to do  --   --  and they come knocking on your door , saying : " What shall I do next ? " Always when you are in the midst of doing what you yourself should be doing next ! HENRY I respect a man 's privacy . I 'll never knock at the door of your study . p. 64 WALDO Do n't be too much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your work now and then  --   --  and ask you to help me mend a cracked wall or pull a few weeds in a lecture I 'm writing . HENRY I 'm not a polite man . I 'll be as frank with you as I am with the back meadow . ( HENRY leaves . LYDIAN and WALDO stare after him . ) LYDIAN Not many people will understand that young man . He does n't want anything . WALDO Perhaps he wants too much . ( All light falls away , except the moonlight glow on the jail cell . HENRY walks back into the cell , stands by the barred casement and listens again to the sounds of Concord . BAILEY jerks awake , sits up suddenly . ) BAILEY What time is it ? HENRY Where were you planning to go ? BAILEY Back to sleep . But I like to know how much of the night has swum by . HENRY In Samarkand , it is not quite noon . BAILEY That near Boston ? HENRY It 's as far away from Boston as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . p. 65 BAILEY I never could figger out how it could be one time here and another time somewheres else . Is n't it now all over ? HENRY You 're wiser than most men who wear watches . I do n't know what good it does to hang numbers on the hours . You ca n't count a river while it moves by you . The best thing to do is take off your clothes and go swimming in it . And when you feel the water all around you , then you 're part of the total river  --   --  where it 's been , where it is , where it 's flowing . Plunge in ! BAILEY I do n't swim good . HENRY There 's no trick to it . Yes , there is . One trick . You ca n't struggle with the water . If you fling your arms around and thrash and fight the stream , it fights back . And you go under . ( A drunk , laughing incoherently , staggers across the thrust , a mug of ale still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about wildly . BAILEY rises from his cot , crosses to the window beside THOREAU . They both look out . ) BAILEY That one 's gone pretty far under . ( With the broken melody of a drinking song , the drunk weaves off . ) HENRY Drowned and drunk with ale and civilization . BAILEY Do you drink ? p. 66 HENRY Do you ? BAILEY When I can afford it . HENRY It does n't cost anything to be drunk . It need n't . It should n't . A man can be drunk all the time . Where I live , you can get drunk on the air . BAILEY ( Deliciously intrigued . ) Where 's that ? When they let me out , maybe I 'll come get drunk with you . When they let you out . Where 's it at ?

But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At night  --   --  in the dark ? HENRY Why be afraid ? The witches are all hung . Christianity and candles have been invented . BAILEY You live there all the time ? HENRY All the time . BAILEY ( Wistfully . ) I wish I had a place to belong . It 's always been a marvel to me how a man can git the money together to own himself a house that belongs to him . p. 67 HENRY Want to hear how much my mansion cost me ? Twenty-eight dollars , twelve and a half cents ! BAILEY Man-a-mighty ! I alwuz thought a house cost a fortune . Hundred dollars or more ! How do you eat ? HENRY Very well . I have a bean patch , some Indian corn . Now and then Walden serves me up a fish . BAILEY What happens in winter ? HENRY ( Starting to take off one shoe . ) It snows .

( Flute and woods projection fade . ) Oh , there are a few things you have to get in town . So you walk into town . ( HENRY pulls off his shoe , thrusts his hand into it and pokes his finger through a hole in the sole . Then , one shoe on and one shoe off , he comes into the foreground . The light subsides on the jail cell and BAILEY lies back on his cot in the shadows . It is late afternoon of a hot July day , and the thrust is the main street of Concord . Several people pass by HENRY . They look questioningly at his curious condition ; one shoe on and one shoe off . But HENRY seems oblivious to it . He nods , saluting the passers-by with his shoe .

BALL How is life among the savages ? HENRY If I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . ( Blithely , HENRY salutes him with his shoe and limps on . SAM STAPLES ambles toward HENRY . He has a piece of paper which he holds distastefully . ) SAM ( Clearing his throat . ) Hullo , Henry . HENRY Oh , hello , Sam . SAM What 's wrong with your foot ? HENRY Foot 's fine . Got a sick shoe . ( He wiggles a finger through the hole in the sole . ) Cobbler 'll cure it . ( HENRY starts to walk down the street . ) SAM Henry . I  --   --  uh  --   --  got something here for ya . HENRY Oh ? SAM ( Awkwardly . ) I can understand how a man could forget  --   --  bein ' as busy as you are  --   --  out there  --   --  uh  --   --  writin ' about them birds and talkin ' to the fish and whatever else it is you do out there by yourself . Naturally it do n't occur to you to think much about taxes . p. 69 HENRY No , I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid . HENRY Why ? SAM It 's the law . I ai n't blamin ' you for bein ' forgetful , Henry . May surprise you to learn you ai n't paid your tax for two years . HENRY Six . SAM ( Firming up . ) I got this order . And I got to serve it on ya . Here ! ( He thrusts the legal paper on HENRY . ) HENRY ( With a kind of arrogant calm . ) Why , thanks , Sam . ( He takes the document , glances at it , then folds it slowly , creasing it carefully . Then he slides it inside his shoe and pulls the shoe on . He stands on it , tests it with a few steps . ) Fits just fine ! Exactly what I needed . I may not have to go to the cobbler after all . SAM ( Irked . ) Now , Henry . That there is an official paper . You ca n't walk over it like that . HENRY Why not ? Best thing I ever got from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it do n't pleasure me none , servin ' a court order on you . Sometimes this is an unpleasant job ! p. 70 HENRY Then quit . If you do n't like bein ' constable , Sam , resign . SAM Somebody 's got to do the work of the people . HENRY Oh , you work for the people ? SAM Yes ! HENRY Well , I 'm " people "  --   --  and you do n't have to work for me . You 're free ! If it 'll make you any happier , I 'll fire you ! SAM Lookee here , Henry . You gon na pay up your tax or ai n't ya ? HENRY You pay your tax , Sam ? SAM If I did n't , I 'd have to arrest myself . HENRY Are you going to arrest me ? ( There 's a long pause . The two men look at each other evenly . ) SAM I do n't want to , Henry . But the government gets persnickety about taxes when we got a war goin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY . ) After all , it ai n't a big sum of money . If  --   --  if you 're hard up , why I 'll pay it . HENRY ( Erupting . ) Do n't you dare ! SAM A loan , just . You can pay me back when  --   --  ( Now all the molten outrage within HENRY DAVID THOREAU bursts out like lava from a live volcano. ) p. 71 HENRY I will not pay one copper penny to an unjust government ! I would n't pay the tithe and tariff to the church , so I signed off from the church ! Well , I 'm ready right now , Sam , to sign off from the government . Where do I sign ? Where ? SAM You ca n't do that . HENRY Why not ? SAM ( Lamely . ) Well , even the President has to obey the laws ! HENRY The poor President !

( For the first time , HENRY realizes that he is surrounded by a little ring of people , so he addresses them as well as SAM . ) I 'll tell you this . If one thousand If one hundred If ten men ten honest men , only If one honest man in this state of Massachusetts had the conviction and the courage to withdraw from this unholy partnership and let himself be locked up in the County Jail , it 'd be the start of more true freedom than we 've seen since a few farmers had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road .

But Henry  --  ( A pause . ) HENRY  --  is here . ( LYDIAN hesitates , then hands the basket back to EDWARD . ) LYDIAN Take your huckleberries to the kitchen , will you , dear ? ( The boy starts off , then turns , at the edge of the light . ) EDWARD ( With a fresh thought . ) If Henry 's my father , that means you 've got a husband , Mama . Not in England or someplace else all the time , but right here in our house . Would n't that be nicer ? For you ? ( LYDIAN and HENRY exchange glances , and the boy goes off. ) p. 87 LYDIAN I  --  I suppose it is n't wise . For you to keep on working here while Waldo 's away . HENRY Please do n't be afraid of me LYDIAN Should n't I be ? ( She gets up , restlessly . ) Oh , you 're going to tell me that you have too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And his wife . LYDIAN Respect is based on friendship . And friendship is based on love . And love is so accidental . Is n't it , Henry ? ( HENRY moistens his lips . ) HENRY We love without knowing it . A man  --  or a woman  --  ca n't love on schedule . I do n't wake up in the morning and say : " I shall start loving at nine-twenty , and continue until ten-fifteen . " Yes , it is accidental . And it 's everywhere  --  it 's the wind , the tide , the waves , the sunshine . LYDIAN ( Very quietly . ) Henry . If love is all around you , like huckleberries  --  why do you pick loneliness ? ( EDWARD bursts in carrying a protesting live chicken . ) EDWARD Mama ! Henry ! Look what happened to the chicken 's feet ! ( The boy holds up the chicken . ) He 's wearing gloves ! p. 88 LYDIAN No , Edward , that 's not poss  --  it is wearing gloves ! ( She turns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheepishly . ) The other day you said they were scratching in your garden , uprooting your rose plants . So I gave a little elegance to the ladies of the henhouse . They 've scratched their last . Your roses are safe . LYDIAN ( Examining the chicken-gloves . ) You made these for all the chickens ? HENRY I 'm opposed to social distinctions . Once one chicken is gloved , you ca n't expect the other ladies to go about bare-clawed . ( They laugh . ) EDWARD ( Eagerly . ) Can I take him out and show him to everybody ? LYDIAN He 's a " she , " dear . Yes , I suppose you can . HENRY But bring the lady home and latch the gate . If you want an omelette for breakfast . ( EDWARD scurries off with the chicken . ) LYDIAN My roses thank you . HENRY Oh , they 're very welcome . LYDIAN Get married , Henry . Find a face  --  and teach yourself to love it . p. 89 HENRY I have . ( LYDIAN looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resolute bachelor . And Nature is my mother-inlaw . LYDIAN There are so many pretty young girls  --   --  HENRY I would drive them promptly into old age . I 'm not that cruel . LYDIAN You need a brain to toss on the pillow next to you . What about Margaret Fuller ? ( HENRY repeats the name , as if he were rinsing it out of his mouth . ) HENRY Margaret Fuller ? Oh , I could n't marry her . LYDIAN Why not ? HENRY Two reasons . First , I 'm not stupid enough to ask her . Second , she 'd never be stupid enough to accept . ( Turning . ) You want to be a matchmaker , Lydian ? Find me something innocent and natural and uncomplicated . A shrub-oak . A cloud . A leaf lost in the snow . LYDIAN But is n't it lonely , Henry ? HENRY Lonely ! ( He laughs . ) I am no more lonely , Lydian , than the North Star , or the South Wind , or the first spider in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your loneliness ? Is it enough to go to bed each night with nothing but a letter from England ? Telling about your husband 's overwhelming passion for Carlyle ? ( She looks down . HENRY reaches out , touching her sleeve . ) Is n't it a pity that you are so " safe " with me ? ( In the cell , BAILEY seems in the midst of a conversation. ) p. 90 BAILEY I 'm skeered of a trial . I ai n't got no lawyer . ' Course the food ai n't too bad here . ( HENRY has crossed back into the cell and the lights have faded on LYDIAN . ) Would you be my lawyer ? HENRY ( Stops short . ) I 'm no lawyer ! BAILEY Could n't you be one  --  for me ? You talk like a lawyer . And you 're smart as most . HENRY Bailey , I would give you my coat , or my shoes , or my last peck of beans ; I would chop wood for you , or push a wheelbarrow for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone ! I think Lucifer was a lawyer : that 's why the Devil still gives advice to Presidents . BAILEY Who 'm I gon na get ? HENRY If I were God , Bailey  --  instead of just a speck of Him  --  I would n't let you die away in the dark . ( BAILEY is panicky . He gets up from the cot . ) BAILEY Tell me what to do ! HENRY ( Rubbing his chin . ) Well , you might try getting yourself born in a more just and generous age . That 's not a very practical suggestion . ( Another thought . ) I suppose you could try prayer . p. 91 BAILEY I 'm not very good at it . HENRY Neither am I. BAILEY But could you say one for me ? HENRY Is the Lord so almighty absentminded that He needs a tap on the shoulder  --  to remind Him that Adam had children ? BAILEY A prayer could n't hurt none . HENRY All right . Let 's send God a telegram . ( He clasps his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For they do not read the President 's speeches.Blessed Are They who never read a newspaper , For they shall see Nature and , through her , God.And Blessed is Bailey , for he 's a good fellowand deserves better treatment than you 've beengiving him  --  even though he is a man of letters.Amen . " BAILEY Amen . Do you think it got through ? HENRY I would n't know . I do n't usually pray with words . I prefer a flute . ( As BAILEY sinks back onto his cot , the lights dip in the cell . HENRY moves forward into the amber sunlight of the forestage , and the background takes on again the leaf-woven texture of the Walden woods . HENRY reaches for a flute and begins to play something strange and peaceful  --  an unconventional forest idyll . The shadowy figure of a man climbs out of the pit as HENRY plays . Crouching , the man creeps through the brush , unseen by HENRY . The man is WILLIAMS , a black , in dirty , tattered clothes . He is husky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he thinks he may have been detected  --  so he darts behind another imaginary bush . With a sigh , HENRY puts aside his flute and bends down to reach for something on the ground . WILLIAMS thinks he is going for a gun . He leaps onto the back of the astonished HENRY , clamping a huge hand over HENRY 's mouth. ) p. 92 WILLIAMS You ai n't takin ' no gun on me ! ( Calmly HENRY rotates the handle of the implement he was reaching for . It is a hoe . WILLIAMS relaxes a little , takes his hand off HENRY 's mouth . ) HENRY You thought this was a rifle ? A rifle 's no good for hoeing beans . ( He is gentle . ) Mind if I go ahead ? ( WILLIAMS is afraid , uncertain . ) There is n't a gun within three-quarters of a mile of here . ( HENRY is unhanded and begins to hoe . The black watches . ) What can I do for you ? WILLIAMS I need vittles . Gim me some vittles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take about three weeks for these beans to come up . WILLIAMS By then I 'll be sleepin ' wi ' them beans ! 1 got ta git to Canada . HENRY To where ? WILLIAMS Caada . Caada ! North as I kin git ! They say the Norther ya git , the free-er ya git ! HENRY ( As he hoes . ) There 's a quarter loaf of bread inside the hut . Help yourself . ( WILLIAMS starts to move in the direction HENRY has indicated  --  then hesitates , turns back. ) p. 93 WILLIAMS You trustin ' me to go inside your place ? Without you watchin ' ? HENRY Why not ? ( WILLIAMS pauses  --  then darts into the shadows while HENRY placidly hoes his beans . Then he calls toward the off-stage hut : ) If you want to stay till supper , I 'll catch us a fish . What 's your name ? ( Almost immediately WILLIAMS reappears with a chunk of bread which he chews on ravenously . ) WILLIAMS ( His mouth full . ) Williams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . WILLIAMS marvels  --  then reaches out tentatively for HENRY 'S handshake , first wiping his hand on his pant-leg . ) Williams your first name or your last name ? WILLIAMS It 's all my name . ( Suddenly . ) But I ai n't no slave . I ai n't goin ' back to bein ' no slave . No man gon na take me back . ( With fire . ) I borned myself two weeks ago . HENRY Good for you , Mr. Williams . WILLIAMS I belonged to Mr. Williams . I was Mr. Williams ' Williams . No more . ( HENRY studies him . WILLIAMS is wary . ) You gon na turn me in ? p. 94 HENRY I 've got no more stomach for slavery than you do . Here you 're as free as I am . ( WILLIAMS begins to breathe more easily . He looks around . ) WILLIAMS How come you live like a black man ? In a slave shack ? HENRY ( Laughs . ) Maybe to prove that less is more . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have any money , that 's all . WILLIAMS ( Still suspicious . ) Where 's your wife ? An ' chillun ? HENRY Well , my bride is this bean patch , Mr. Williams . And I 've adopted several woodchucks . And a few rather unappreciative squirrels . WILLIAMS Nobody " Mistered " me before  --  not ever . HENRY You better get used to it . If you 're going to be a free man . You 'll have to have a first name , too  --  oh , you do n't have to . But it 's handy . WILLIAMS ( Tentatively . ) Henry , maybe ? Could I call myself " Mr. Henry 's Williams " ? HENRY No ! WILLIAMS ( Startled . ) Why you shoutin ' at me ? p. 95 HENRY You do n't belong to anybody , sir . Except yourself . Least of all to me . Watch out  --  or you 'll run right into what you 're running away from . WILLIAMS ( Tasting it . ) Henry Williams HENRY If you do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name ; you can have it , I do n't use it much . WILLIAMS I like Henry Williams ! That sound good ! That 's a free man 's name ! ( He cups his hands and shouts . ) HENRY WILLIAMS ! HENRY But there 's slavery in the North , too . Every man shackled to a ten-hour-a-day job is a work-slave . Every man who has to worry about next month 's rent is a money-slave . Do n't let that happen to you , Mr. Williams . Keep free ! WILLIAMS I do feel free  --  here  --  now ! With you . Never before . I hai n't scared now . HENRY Why should you be ? WILLIAMS ( Abruptly . ) You let me stay here ? I 'll work . Take my chances with the law . I 'm good at hidin ' ! Nobody know I 'm here ! HENRY I welcome you here . But you 've got to find your own Walden , Henry Williams ! Where they do n't have sickening laws which keep black men in suppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a flag . You ca n't hide blackness in blindness . If you want any light in your life , you 'll have to find a place to live where men think of themselves as men  --  not as white men . ( Putting his hand on WILLIAMS ' shoulder . ) Go to " Canyada " ! ( The light jades on the black man and the white man in the foreground . In the EMERSONS ' area , the light picks up WALDO in the midst of an argument . His stance is twisted  --  almost a contortion  --  as if he were trying to stand simultaneously on opposite sides of a question  --  which he is. ) p. 96 WALDO I have cast my vote ! I 've done it . I put it in the ballot-box . What more do you expect me to do ? ( HENRY moves into the scene . ) HENRY ( Aflame with indignation . ) Cast your whole vote . Not just a strip of paper ! Your whole influence ! WALDO ( Turning . ) We have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) " Go along ! " WALDO ( Reasonably . ) Henry , one must consider the economic and sociological ramifications . When white people and black try to live together , it 's infinitely complicated . HENRY ( Pounding his fist in the palm of his hand . ) Then simplify ! Simplify ! WALDO ( Shaking his head . ) You complicate things all the more by rushing them . You 're a naturalist , Henry . You understand the slow evolving of the seasons . It 's the same with human relationships . You ca n't rush a sunrise . HENRY ( With tethered anger . ) When a man leaps from a moving freight train  --  and tries to scramble through the woods to cross the border into Caada  --  p. 97 WALDO Where ? HENRY ( Impatiently . ) Into Canada ! A free-er country even though they still have the Crown . But they do n't have a Fugitive Slave Law . When a man , at the border of freedom , is stopped by the rifle of a Boston policeman , he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slow evolving of the seasons . " WALDO Henry , I am just as shocked at the death of this man as you are . What was his name ? HENRY ( Quietly . ) Henry Williams . A new man . With a new name . Hardly used ! WALDO I am just as concerned  --  HENRY Are you ? To you , Henry Williams is an abstraction . You may be able to use him sometime as a digression in a Lyceum lecture . WALDO How can you be so unpleasant to me when I 'm trying to agree with you ? ( The fever between the men is rising . ) HENRY I expect more from you than from anybody else ; that 's why I 'm more disappointed in you . WALDO Well , what do you expect of me ? HENRY Speak out ! p. 98 WALDO I speak . HENRY It 's not enough . Shout ! WALDO I am not a shouter . HENRY Not with your voice-box ! With your brain ! Waldo , I ca n't reach anybody . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . ( Passionately . ) But my God , you are EMERSON ! ( There are almost tears in HENRY 'S eyes as he experiences a mixture of admiration and contempt for his idol . ) Darling of the Lyceum , Lord of the Lecture Circuit ! Every word you say from the platform is treasured , like an heirloom . Stand up , Waldo , and say what you believe ! WALDO ( Distantly . ) Sometimes I think I invented you , Henry . Or at least prophesied you . Because you live what I talk about . I could n't exist the way you do , Henry ; I like my warm toast and tea and soft-boiled egg brought to me on a tray in bed each morning . Whenever I even think of Walden , I get a cold . But I admire you , Henry , I really do . You 're my walking ethic ! ( HENRY stares at WALDO , marveling at how he can drift off the point . ) Those are the exact words I used to describe you to Carlyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 99 HENRY ( Frustrated , turning away . ) I do n't care what you told Carlyle . WALDO I said to Carlyle : " Of all the men in Concord , Henry Thoreau is the best of the lot ! " That 's what I told him . ( Enjoying quoting himself . ) " A poet as full of buds of promise as a young apple tree . " That 's what I said . HENRY Waldo , do n't talk about me  --  talk to me . Listen to me . WALDO ( His thoughts still in England . ) Whu  --  ? How was that ? HENRY ( Evenly . ) Can you lie in bed every morning ? Have your breakfast brought to you  --  your soft-boiled egg , your toast and tea ? Can you lift your right hand to your mouth while your left hand  --  which is also you  --  your government  --  is killing men in Mexico ? How can you swallow , Waldo ? How can you taste ? How can you breathe ? You cast your ballot with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Williams , running to be free ! WALDO Because I do n't rant like Jeremiah , do you think I 'm not outraged ? I do what can be done ! HENRY That 's not enough . Do the impossible . That 's what you tell people in your lectures . But you do n't really believe any of it , do you ? You trundle up and down New England , stepping to the lectern with that beneficent smile , accepting the handshake of mayors and the polite applause of little old ladies . You go on singing your spineless benedictions . p. 100 WALDO What I say is not spineless ! ( LYDIAN enters , drawn by their raised voices . ) HENRY Well , occasionally you 've sounded a battle-cry . But you  --  you yourself  --  refuse to hear it . WALDO ( Squirming . ) You are a very difficult man ! HENRY Good . The world is too full of easy men . WALDO Do you want me to go out and advocate violence and rebellion ? HENRY I ask you to stop violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hatched from a soft-boiled egg ? ? ? ( Gesturing . ) Look around Concord ; what do you see ? We have become everything we protested against ! WALDO And what are you doing about it , young man ? You pull the woods up over your head . You resign from the human race . Could your woodchucks , with all their wisdom , have saved Henry Williams ? Are your fish going to build roads , teach school , put out fires ? ( For a moment , HENRY is caught without a ready reply . ) Oh , it 's very simple for a hermit to sit off at a distance and proclaim exactly how things should be . But what if everybody did that ? Where would we be ? p. 101 HENRY Where are we , Waldo ? WALDO We are at war . I am aware of it . HENRY Are you aware of the reasons  --  slave-holders grasping for more slave territory ? More slavery and less freedom , is that what you want ? WALDO Henry , we must work within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war  --  the condition of the blacks  --  this is the business of the President . And the Congress . HENRY Do you really believe that ? Then I guess I 'm wrong . I thought you had the same disgust that I have for what the military is doing . But if it does n't trouble you , then I must 've made a mistake . ( With acid sarcasm . ) You 're right to keep still . I 'll go back to the woods  --  and leave you at peace with your war . ( WALDO is in genuine pain . He glances at his wife . ) WALDO ( After a pause . ) All right , my young conscience . What shall I do ? HENRY Declare yourself ! ( Another pause . ) WALDO I will . Absolutely . The next time the occasion arises  --   --  HENRY ( Fiercely . ) NOW ! A year ago was too late ! I 'll get you an audience . This afternoon . At Concord Square ! ( HENRY strides out of the light . WALDO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls away on the EMERSONS . A bell-rope drops from the flies as the light comes up on the thrust . HENRY springs up , grasps the rope , and swings on it . A bell from above peals , a reverberating command . People begin to assemble , curious and excited. ) p. 102 FARMER ( Running on . ) Fire someplace ? WOMAN What 's the news ? Is the war over ? SAM What you doin ' up there , Henry ? What 's goin ' on ? ( There is a growing babble of voices as the crowd gathers . HENRY lets go of the rope as the swinging bell dies away . ) HENRY Dr. Emerson 's coming . To speak . He 's promised to make a statement ! Now . Right here . Ca n't wait ! MOTHER ( Rushing on . ) Oh , David Henry ! Are you riling everybody up again ? HENRY Emerson is going to rile up the whole country . And you 're going to hear it first ! FARMER Is he going to say something or give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENRY Both ! God willing ! ( Others are gathering . ) SAM Dr. Emerson gon na speak now ? HENRY I just left him ! He 's on his way . ( There is a babble of anticipation . One man  --  probably a local newspaperman  --  draws out a pad and pencil , prepared to write. ) p. 103 VOICE And no lecture charge , neither ! ( There is a pause as they wait . They 're getting a little restless . ) WOMAN Well , where is he ? ( Several start to go . The reporter puts away his pad . ) HENRY ( Confidently . ) Do n't worry ! He 's coming . He 'll be here ! ( LYDIAN enters slowly , her head down . The crowd falls back to let her through . She comes up to HENRY . Silently she looks into his face . She clears her throat . ) LYDIAN Dr. Emerson has asked me to tell you  --  HENRY ( Gray . ) Yes ? LYDIAN  --  that he wants more time to meditate on these matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . ) So that he can write a careful essay setting forth his position . HENRY And he gave his wife the happy job of coming here to tell us ? Like a walking-written-excuse to a schoolmaster , saying : " So sorry , Johnny can not come today , he 's in bed with the croup " ? ( LYDIAN shares HENRY 'S feeling , but her loyalty to her husband is unshakable. ) p. 104 LYDIAN Waldo wants to collect his thoughts . HENRY ( Outraged . ) What is this , the winter of our content ? By the time he " collects his thoughts , " they 'll be dead as dandelions under the snow . ( The crowd is restless and begins to disintegrate . ) FARMER Well , we come running to the fire , but nobody lit it . That 's Henry for ya . ( As the crowd wanders off , HENRY stares at LYDIAN . Slowly , he turns away from her and starts to go , too . ) LYDIAN ( Stopping him . ) Henry  --  my husband loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ( HENRY stops , but his back is still to LYDIAN . ) HENRY ( Shaking his head . ) My God , he was my god ! No more ! If he is the Deity , I am a doubter ! LYDIAN Why do you enjoy hurting him ? HENRY ( Wheeling on her . ) He hurts me ! ( They are both talking at once , their speeches overlapping . ) LYDIAN He cares what you think , and so he gets excited and overstates himself  --   --  p. 105 HENRY Patronizing , that 's what he is . I wo n't sit at the foot of his pulpit ! LYDIAN When he talks to you  --   --  HENRY He never talks to me ! Was he talking to me just now ? ( Bitterly . ) He was in England , pontificating with Carlyle ! LYDIAN You widen the distance  --   --  HENRY It 's a waste of breath , talking to your husband . Trying to have a sane discussion with him . I lose my time , almost my identity  --   --  LYDIAN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a cricket match . Hitting and pushing and kicking each other  --  not for the sake of the idea , just playing to win ! HENRY ( Coldly . ) Your husband , Mrs. Emerson , has the misfortune of being a gentleman . And famous . And he is drowning in his own success . LYDIAN My husband 's best friend does n't even know who my husband is ! You 've drawn some ideal in your mind , some imaginary Waldo  --  the way you want him to be . Please , Henry , give him the same liberty he gives you  --  to be what you are . ( HENRY looks down , does n't answer . Everyone has gone now . LYDIAN would like to say , " I 'm sorry , Henry , I wish I could comfort you "  --  but she does n't . Quickly , LYDIAN moves off . HENRY looks around at the empty square which was recently so full of people. ) p. 106 HENRY ( Shouts . ) Citizens of Concord  --  !

The bell-rope vanishes in the flies . He throws himself on his cot in the cell . The sky goes red . HENRY writhes on the cot . There is a cannon blast  --  and the sky seems ripped apart by psychedelic splatterings of shrapnel . A snare drum snarls a military cadence . A DRUMMER BOY marches on , turns smartly front .

And it works . Now a fella in New York can send words down there ' lectric  --  fast as he can talk . HENRY ( As he sips his chocolate thoughtfully . ) But Sam , what if nobody in New York has anything to say to anybody in Texas ? SAM I just thought you 'd be happy to know . Another thing  --  uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can leave , Henry . Any time you 're a mind to . HENRY Leave ? p. 113 SAM During the night yer tax got paid up . HENRY Who did it ? SAM Hai n't material fer me to say . HENRY Waldo ! Did Dr. Emerson pay it ? SAM No sir . HENRY My mother . SAM No . HENRY Did you ? SAM I offered , Henry . You flat refused . HENRY Mrs. Emerson . Did she come and pay it ? SAM Now stop pokin ' around tryin ' to get me to tell . I promised your Aunt Louisa I would n't open my  --  HENRY ( Disgusted . ) Aunt Louisa ! ( BAILEY is beginning to stir . ) I am cursed with the charity of my mother 's sister ! ( Shouting offstage to her . ) Aunt Louisa , why could n't you leave your nose and your false teeth out of my life ! I hereby EXCOMMUNICATE YOU FROM THE MILKY WAY ! ( SAM swings the jail door open , hands HENRY a paper . ) SAM Been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the receipt . ( HENRY ignores the paper. ) p. 114 HENRY I do n't want it . You ca n't accuse me of paying my tax ! SAM It 's been paid ! HENRY Not by me . I 'm still guilty . ( HENRY sits on the cot , doggedly . ) SAM Henry , a man 's got no right to stay in jail if they 's no charge ag'in him . I ca n't even bring you lunch . BAILEY ( A bit wistfully . ) You goin ' already ? SAM He 's goin ' ! HENRY No ! SAM Law put you in here . The law says when you 're out . BAILEY Gon na be God-a'mighty quiet around here ( HENRY stares intensely at BAILEY . ) What 's wrong ? HENRY ( Softly . ) Everything 's wrong  --  when a man only thinks about himself . ( Wheeling sharply on SAM . ) Sam ! You know what quid pro quo means ? SAM ( Pained . ) That one of them Harvard words ? HENRY It means if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another three months , or another three weeks , but now , right away  --  why , then maybe I 'll favor your law by walking out onto the sidewalk . Not before . p. 115 SAM It ai n't in my power . I do n't make decisions like that . ( HENRY gets back into his cot , pulls the blanket over him . ) HENRY Goodnight , Sam . SAM ( Suffering . ) It 's morning , Henry . HENRY Not for me . Not until you let Bailey out . SAM I 'll do everything I kin . I 'll talk to the Judge and the Selectmen . HENRY Tell them unless Mr. Bailey 's trial is right away , they 'll have another eating , non-paying guest in their jail  --  permanently ! ( SAM goes out , almost wishing he were a soldier in Mexico . BAILEY is moved . Nobody in his life has ever stood up for him like this . ) BAILEY Thankee . I ai n't ever gon na fergit this night here . And  --  when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't mind  --  at your pond place . ( The sound of the flute re-enters , but there is no leafy projection  --  only the mounting flames of dawn . Pause : HENRY is making a difficult decision . He comes down , staring far off , toward Walden . ) HENRY I may not be there at the " pond place , " Bailey . Seems to me I 've got several more lives to live . And I do n't know if I can spare any more time for that one . p. 116 BAILEY Sounds to me like it 's just about perfick . HENRY That 's the trouble . If I live there much longer , I might live there forever . And you have to think twice before you accept heaven on terms like that . ( Abruptly . ) You ever take a boat trip , Bailey ? BAILEY Riverboat only . HENRY When you buy a cabin ticket for an ocean passage , they give you the liberty of the whole ship . It 's a privilege that should be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place , below decks , no matter how dry and cozy it is . And warm . ( Simply . ) I think I 'll have to roam the whole ship . Go before the mast ! Stand out there on the foredeck . ( The flute melody falls away . ) Bailey , I tried to escape . But escape is like sleep . And when sleep is permanent , it 's death . ( A pause . He moves closer to the imagined downstage window , so the morning sun fills his face . ) I must leave Walden . ( The words are painful to him . BAILEY goes toward HENRY as if to comfort him , raising a hand toward his shoulder ; but BAILEY is helpless . ) It 's not necessary to be there in order to be there . ( BAILEY moves to the window , prompted by the growing light on HENRY 's face . He looks out , awed. ) p. 117 BAILEY Bright morning . Gon na be a fine July day out there . HENRY Sometimes the light gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just darkness all over again . ( He looks up . The sky is really brilliant with the sunlight now . ) But there is more day to dawn . The sun is only a morning star . ( He shakes hands with BAILEY , starts out , remembers something : his shoe . He gets it from under the bed , salutes BAILEY with it . In the doorway , HENRY stops , looks up sharply . From a distance , he hears an eccentric , non-military drummer . He moves into Concord Square ablaze with morning light . Suddenly the drumbeat comes from a different direction , growing in volume . It is like thunder all around him . His eyes follow the arc of the sky . He seems to grow in stature , lifted and strengthened by a greater challenge . He waves to BAILEY , who waves back warmly from the cell window . With determinaiton , HENRY leaps from the stage and strides up the aisle of the theatre to the sound of his own different drummer . No curtain falls . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtain calls , and as the audience leaves the theatre , HENRY 's distinctive and irregular drum-cadence builds and resounds. )
