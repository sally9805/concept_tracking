txt Most economists , in Government and out , are now sure the economy has entered a recession . National output fell at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in April , May and June . And the White House has circulated a " confidential " memo predicting that unemployment will climb to 8.2 percent over the next year . By the new calculus . of stagflation , 7 percent unemployment is considered politically tolerable ; 8 or 9 percent is not . Unless the Administration 's pessimistic forecast is contradicted by events in the next few months , the case for fiscal stimulus will be compelling and the President will almost certainly call for a tax cut . But Mr. Carter 's preference seems to be for a cut in Social Security payroll taxes . The same amount of stimulus applied in other ways would do more to cure the economy 's long-term ills . ? The political case for a payroll tax reduction is almost irresistible . The Social Security tax is visible and affects almost everyone . To meet the accelerating cost of Social Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few years and is headed even higher . Relieving it would be a popular election-year gift to the voters . But the Social Security trust fund would then be inadequate for all benefits ; some pensions would have to be paid from general Federal revenues . Thus the link between the Social Security tax and benefit levels would be broken ? and a valuable form of fiscal discipline in the pension system would be lost . Another tempting argument for a Social Security tax cut concerns inflation . The economic problem of our age is how to keep the economy growing without aggravating it . Reducing Social Security taxes would reduce the cost of doing business and help hold down prices . But other tax cuts may promise a greater antiinflationary bang for the buck : Wage insurance . The President failed to win Congressional approval last spring for a plan to compensate workers who accepted his wage guidelines and then saw their real pay eroded by inflation . A tax break designed with the help of organized labor could certainly be used to reward the innocent victims of inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the country wo n't know until it tries . Productivity incentives . The least painful way to dissipate inflation is to pay for higher incomes with greater capacity for production ? Improved productivity . That requires more investment by business . So a tax cut could be aimed squarely at stimulating such investment , permitting faster tax write-offs or tax credits for new equipment . Energy independence . Inflation is a trap baited with foreign oil . With world oil supplies stretched tight , economic growth leads directly to higher oil prices . There are already substantial tax breaks for homeowners who buy solar heating or add insulation . But it may be worthwhile to " spend " a tax cut on further incentives to reduce the OPEC drain on the economy through conservation and conversion to other fuels . We do n't know which is the best anti-inflationary way to use a tax cut . But we do know that there is now some time to assess the alternatives . We hope the President will use that time to reconsider his apparent preference for a reduction in the Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
