It was an electrifying announcement . At a hastily called press conference at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif , last weekend , Viking Scientist Harold Klein reported that the newly begun biology experiments aboard the Mars lander had already shown a strange process-perhaps life-going on in the Martian soil . Said Klein : " We have at least preliminary evidence of a very active surface material . It looks at first indication very much like biological activity . " <P> The evidence that excited Viking scientists came from two of the three biological tests that had begun only three days earlier . One of the Viking experiments , designed to detect respiration , showed that 15 times as much oxygen as the scientists expected had come from the Martian soil sample . The other , which uses radioactive tracers to look for signs of metabolic activity , showed what Klein called " a very strong , positive response . " Said a Viking spokesman : " If there is life on Mars , this is what it should be doing . " <P> Viking scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply have been released from some mineral in the soil sample when it was placed in the heated experiment chamber , and the radioactive gases produced in the other test might have been caused by an oxidation process not connected with life . Still , said Klein , " if it is a biological response , then it is a stronger response than we have seen in fairly rich terrestrial soil , and it would also imply that microbal life on Mars is highly developed-more intense than it is on earth . " <P> At one point early in the eventful week , it had been so quiet at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory that scientists could hear a pin drop . Then , 214 million miles away , a pin did drop-onto the reddish soil of Mars . It fell from Viking , freeing the mechanical arm that it had jammed and enabling the lander to begin its historic life-seeking experiments . Some 19 minutes later , as telemetry confirming that the arm was no longer jammed appeared on the console screens at JPL , scientists and engineers broke into cheers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functioning instrument in a spacecraft . " <P> Three days later , shortly after Martian sunrise , Viking reached out with its arm , scooped up a sample of Martian soil and dumped it into the craft 's biological laboratory . Scientists first learned that the arm was working from a picture transmitted from the lander . The shot showed a footprint-like trench about 6 in. long , 2 in. wide and 2 in. deep that had been scooped out by Viking . Scientists were struck by the fact that the sides of the trench had not collapsed . Said Princeton University Geologist Robert Hargraves : " It 's strange material . It looks and acts like wet sand .
