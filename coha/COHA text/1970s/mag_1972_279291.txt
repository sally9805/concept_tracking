Humorist Will Rogers was never in any party 's hip pocket . As he remarked in 1932 , " This is not an election of parties or policies this fall . It 's an election where both sides really need the work . " How to tell a Republican from a Democrat ? " The Republican says , ' Well , things could have been worse , ' and the Democrat says , ' How ? ' " Nevertheless , <P> Will 's slogan " I never met a man I did n't like " has been appropriated by some Republicans , who have now put out a bumper sticker proclaiming : WILL ROGERS NEVER MET GEORGE MCGOVERN . <P> One man who saw nothing funny about this tactic was Will Rogers Jr. , a Democrat and McGovern supporter , who denounced the sticker as " grave robbing . " " If my father had met George McGovern , " said Will Jr. , " I am confident he would have liked him . My father 's writing should not be twisted and distorted by either party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Re-Election of the President denied authorizing the sticker , but traced its origin to a television repairman from Midwest City , Okla . Obviously , Will Rogers never met a TV repairman .
