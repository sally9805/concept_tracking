A REPORTER AT LARGE SIMPLY stated , there has never been anything like it in Wash  --  ington before . The struggle over the Presidential nomination between President Carter and Senator Edward M. Kennedy established , rapidly , an atmosphere that resembles nothing so much as a civil war . A city obsessed with politics in any event was sudden  --  ly presented with not just an ordinary contest for a nomination but a brutal struggle for very high stakes between two very determined , powerful , and combative men , each backed by very determined , combative forces . The struggle had seemed theoretically pos  --  sible for some time , but its actuality turned out in short order to be of a magnitude and nature that had not been imagined . There have been chal  --  lenges to Presidents from within their own parties in recent years , but no challenger in memory has occupied such an important base of power in Washington . The struggle tears at loyalties , friendships , even families . Meanwhile , Republican candidates oc  --  casionally troop across the Washing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  wise further their ambitions . And  --  as befits any Presidential-election season , only this time more so  --  others here make their calculations of what to do , what would be the best position to have been in at the right time . And , of course , the speculation about how it will all come out goes on with great intensity , irrespective of the fact that such speculation is futile . Suddenly the campaign has backed up on us . For some time , there had been preliminaries in the year before an election , but it be  --  came dear early this fall that these were no longer the preliminaries . ? M oines UDALL has adopted what he calls Udall 's Law . Udall 's Law is that all the pet theories on the front-runners and the favorites a year before the election are neat , simple , cold , logical , and wrong . There arc innumerable examples of the validity of this law , but they do nothing to dimin  --  ish the speculation . The prevailing view about what is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week 's certainty is , while utterly different from , no less certain than , last week 's certainty . The speculation about the Democrats ran , in a matter of a few weeks : Kennedy will clobber Car  --  ter . No , wait a minute , Kennedy has liabilities , and Carter and his people are good at campaigning  --  in fact , that is what they are good at . No , Kennedy is going to clobber Carter ? early . Wait , Kennedy 's liabilities are real , and seri ? ous . On the Republican side , it has run . Reagan has it . No , Reagan is too old , Connally is overtaking him . No , Con  --  nally has too many liabilities ; it 's still Reagan , or , if not Reagan , Howard Baker ; watch out for George Bush . The political tag that is applied to Baker is that , as the saying goes , he " looks good on paper . " But the thing is , the candidates do not run on paper . A number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation . Events that were by no means inevitable are given a retrospective inevitability . Car  --  ter had some good fortune in the early stages of the 1976 nomination struggle and , as it happens , had real trouble , even though he had no single strong opponent , toward the end of it ; he very nearly lost the election . Many people who are suddenly remembering what gifted politicians the Carter peo  --  ple are seem to be overlooking the fact that if they were such gifted politicians they would not be in their present pick  --  le . The speculation takes place in a vacuum . It does not , because it can not , anticipate the kinds of goofs , gaffes , accidents , and outside events that have changed the course of past campaigns . It does not , can not , take into account the changing , intuitive judgments that the public makes as the candidates are subjected to extended scrutiny . The sheer number of candidates in a pri  --  mary can affect the outcome . As can the turnout . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know the result of the 1976 election until 3:46 A.M. the following day . ? THE Kennedy candidacy had a cer  --  tain inevitability , and it remained for Carter to provide the opportunity . Kennedy sometimes says that he would have been content to serve out his years in the Senate , and , of course , he colors his decision to run as one made with the greatest reluctance . But the idea that Edward Kennedy might someday run for President has been around him for a long , long time  --  since even before either of his brothers was assassinated . It has been an open subject since 1968 ? twelve years be  --  fore the 1980 election . Therefore , there were at least twelve years during which Kennedy had to weigh the decision , assess his options and opportunities , and listen to invited and uninvited counsel . The legacy was there , bringing with it some combination of opportunity , ob  --  ligation , and ambition . Kennedy spent a long time " keeping his options open , ? as they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to running for President in 1968 ? there was a great deal of sentiment in favor of his doing so  --  and then , briefly , to running as the Vice-Presidential can  --  didate with George McGovern in 1972 . At one point , he even gave consideration to running with Cartel in 1980 . The theory was that by hav  --  ing served as Vice-President he would he " sanitized " with respect to the per  --  sona problems that shadow his public life  --  that the voters would get used to thinking of him in Presidential terms . One old friend of Kennedy 's says , " He 's walked around the ques  --  tion of his candidacy for a lung time ; a good power operator is always walk  --  ing around that kind of question , sens  --  ing the possibilities . " Yet sixteen years ( or perhaps twenty if a Republican is elected in 1980 and is strong enough to be reelected ) is a long time for a politician to keep himself " viable , " even if he is a Kennedy . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this long-range planning . There are some younger Democrats  --  such as Senators Gary Hart , of Colo  --  rado , and Joseph Biden , of Delaware -- who give off signs that they have ambitions of their own . There are a number of people who tell of conversa  --  tions with Kennedy over the past couple of years in which he gave implicit or explicit indications that he was think  --  ing seriously of running this time . And there were the overt acts : the breaking of the Kennedy tradition of live-and-Iet-live with Republican sen  --  ators from Massachusetts when , in 1978 , Kennedy hacked the Demo  --  crat , Paul Tsongas , over Edward Brooke , putting Tsongas , who won , in a position to look after Kennedy 's interests ; the hiring , in December , 1978 , of Carl Wagner , a political organizer in his early thirties ( Wag  --  ner , who is from Iowa , is presumably not an expert on Massachusetts , and is generally believed to he one of the best political organizers in the country ) ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituent groups to their feet at the Party 's 1978 midterm conference in Memphis and to reinforce his hold on them by mak  --  ing a speech ostensibly about health in  --  surance but actually attacking the Pres  --  ident 's emphasis on military spending at the expense , Kennedy charged , of social programs ; the decision to give - some interviews this past July , ten years after the event , about the inci  --  dent at Chappaquiddick . As matters turned out , those particular interviews , apparently given in the hope that they would make the subject go away , or would at least provide a test of its viru  --  lence , were virtually obliterated from the public mind , coming as they did during the week that the Administration engulfed itself in the chaos of mass resignations and firings . It was during that period that the President began his decline to an all-time low , for any President , in the polls , which also in  --  dicated in the first week in August that Kennedy enjoyed a two-to-one lead over Carter . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having to run with Carter at the head of the ticket . There was a great deal of talk in the cloakrooms about what might hap  --  pen if the Republicans were to take over the Senate . There was a strong feeling on Capitol Hill in July that the Carter Administration had collapsed . Kennedy was presented with a mixture of duty and opportunity : if there were to be a Republican sweep , the Senate would be at least a markedly changed place , several of his allies might be de  --  feated , and , for some time to come , the atmosphere would be a poor one for his issues and his politics . At some point , one becomes tired of turning things over in the mind , of weighing familiar factors . It was during August , by his own account , that Kennedy made the decision to run . Carter also unwittingly , played a hand in the timing of Kennedy 's entry into the race . For some time , Ken  --  nedy had expressed to friends a con  --  cern about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as his brother Robert was when he entered the 1968 race after Eugene McCarthy demonstrated in New Hampshire that Lyndon Johnson was vulnerable  --  if he waited until someone else showed Carter to he vulnerable . Moreover , the later he entered the race , the more serious the problems of organizing a campaign would be . And so , after La  --  bor Day , with the timing still uncer  --  tain , Kennedy began to drop public hints about his decision . ( This had the effect of keeping alive the " Draft Ken  --  nedy " movement and of keeping people who might join or support his campaign at the ready . ) The rationale for his running , he said , was Carter 's failure of leadership . The probability of his can  --  didacy had two effects , one of which was expected , the other not necessarily so . The expected effect was that when Kennedy the candidate , as opposed to Kennedy the theoretical candidate , was measured against Carter , the gap be  --  tween them in the polls would nar  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any event , Carter 's rating would not stay at such a low point . ) The unex  --  pected effect was that the Carter Ad  --  ministration , perhaps because it was faced with the prospect of a Kennedy challenge , gave indications that it had learned something . Several of its legis  --  lative goals began to come to fruition in Congress . Who gets credit for this is subject to some debate , but Carter was looking more " Presidential . " So , lest the rationale slip away , the timing of Kennedy 's entry into the race was ad  --  vanced . Also , it was clear that the Car  --  ter people had for some time been working on their campaign . Politicians , generally speaking , are not patient people , and their very competitiveness makes it difficult for them to stand back once they have decided to wage a fight . Moreover , Kennedy has a hy  --  peractive personality , as many political  --  cians do , and , seeing that he was in for a real fight , once he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead with it . ? ON the morning of Thursday , Oc- tober 18th , at eight o'clock , Ger  --  ald Ford is having breakfast at the Sheraton-Carlton Hotel with a group of reporters . Here is a former Presi  --  dent of the United States , looking well , if a hit older than when he left office , sitting around with a hunch of re  --  porters , talking like one of the guys . Actually , this sort of thing came natu  --  rally to Ford during his many years as a member of the House of Representa  --  tives . The question at the moment is what he plans to do about running for the Presidency again . Ford lost his race for the Presidency in 1976 in the worst possible way  --  narrowly . There are many what-ifs to live with after that . Now he would like to be Presi  --  dent again , if only he did n't have to run for the nomination . Before 1976 , Ford had never run for office in any  --  thing larger than a congressional dis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out with Reagan in the pri  --  maries . At that time , he had the appur  --  tenances of the Presidency to help him along , and still lie almost lost the nomination to Reagan . Ford is leading what many would consider the good life  --  Palm Springs , Vail , well-paid speeches , an ample income , respectful treatment as a former President . Cam  --  paigning for the nomination would make him just one of the pack and subject him to the accompanying in  --  dignities . He is said by friends to enjoy receiving attention when he appears in golf tournaments or gives speeches , and being told that things were better when he was President and that he ought to run again  --  and also to en  --  joy titillating people with hints that he might indeed run . The problem is that all that might be spoiled if he actually ran . Ford 's preference is to wait until a few months into next year to see what happens , and then decide what to do . He is one of the would-he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election hoping that " lightning will strike . " But it has n't in a long time , and the possibility that it will has be  --  come less likely , given the way the nominating system has evolved . Re  --  cently , Ford met in Palm Springs with some of his political advisers , who went over the dates and details of primaries and filing deadlines , and so on , with him . They advised him that if he de  --  layed his decision it would only make it more difficult for others who wanted to oppose Reagan , and might well guar  --  antee Reagan the nomination . Ford was also told that if he waits too long it will be ton late for him . So the ques  --  tion most on the reporters ' minds this morning is what Ford intends to do . He is asked if he is planning to run . " It 's getting more enjoyable on the outside than it was on the inside , " he answers , smiling . " If I came here as a candidate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't come here having to make some point , hav  --  ing to seduce you . I 'm seeing good friends , old acquaintances . Is n't that a nice way to spend a morning ? " The question is repeated in another form . Ford suggests that the press is trying to stir something up . " I 'm exactly to  --  day where I was a year ago , two years ago , " he says . " I will speak out on SALT , other issues . That does n't indi  --  cate I 'm sitting in a smoke-filled room with charts and experts , scheming . If something happens , it happens . I 'm a fatalist . " Anti he adds , " I never say never ' in politics . " In answer to still a third question on the subject , he says , " Only as the pri  --  maries progress there might be some switching , but it 's too early to honestly say that . Nobody 's had a primary yet . . We have n't really had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tinue along the same line . " I 'm not a candidate , I 'm not , " he insists . " Somehow you all do n't believe it . On the other hand , if a scenario developed , I 'd have to take another look at it . " The next day , Ford calls a press conference on Capitol Hill , on short notice , and announces that he has made " a firm decision not to become an ac  --  tive candidate . " He also says that he would be available if the Republican Convention were to be deadlocked but says he thinks chances of that are " very remote . " ? EVERY Presidential campaign causes a large number of people  --  poli  --  ticians whose own fortunes might be affected , people with visions of serving in the White House or in some other high-level government job ( some are quite specific in their own minds quite early ) , strategists for various interest groups , people to whom it is important to have the right connections , and oth  --  er investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in it for them to go which way , and where they want to have been when . This can get very tricky , but never more so than in the situation created by the Carter-Ken  --  nedy struggle , The calculations are es  --  sentially unsentimental and take a num  --  ber of forms . A Democratic senator , over lunch in the Senate Dining Room in mid-October , when Kennedy 's candidacy seemed certain but was not yet official : " Some of the enthusiasm for Ted 's candidacy up here has waned a hit . Carter 's low point was just after Labor Day , and Ted 's high point was right up until he made his move . " When , following its August recess , Congress returned to Washington in early Sep  --  tember , many were convinced that Carter was finished . August had n't gone much better for him than July had ( the furor over Andrew Young and the P.L.O . while Carter floated down the Mississippi , the imbroglio over the Soviet troops in Cuba ) . In mid-September , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even members of the House , who , because they run every two years , feel they are closer to their constituents than senators are , and so generally consider themselves more im  --  mune to the fate of the top of the Presidential ticket , were worried . One House Democrat said to me at the time , " A lot of us could lose , and Car  --  ter is n't worth it . " The Democratic senator continued , " Once it became clear Ted would run , people started attacking him , and others started to consider problems they 'd brushed aside . People here still think he 'll be the nominee , but not as easily as before . Carter 's people ob  --  viously did a professional job in Flori  --  da . " This was just after Carter won , narrowly , a non-binding preliminary caucus vote in Florida on October 13th against an unofficial Kennedy organization . ( Only thirty-four thou  --  sand people participated , and the con  --  test was largely one of logistics . ) " A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineptness and clumsiness in the Carter Administration , Carter 's tried to do the right thing , and he made some tough decisions in the Cu  --  ban mess and got out of it not too bad  --  ly . The conjecture up here is that Ken  --  nedy does well in New England , Car  --  ter does well in the South , and in the end Kennedy takes New York , Penn  --  sylvania , and California . Up here , peo  --  ple feel that those big states are where the Democrats need the help next year . The feeling is that Carter would help in the South but Ted would help in the big states with a whole pile of House seats that could determine the ideology of the House , and would also make a big difference in the Senate . " I asked him if such a calculation assumed that Kennedy would , if he was nominated , win in November . " No , " he replied . " It does n't assume that he wins , but it does assume that his candidacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities , such as blacks and Chicanos  --  that can determine the outcome of other races . Low turn  --  outs have been hurting the Democrats . " There is another side to that as  --  sumption . Some Southern Democrats are unenthusiastic about a Kennedy race for the very reason that some Northern Democrats are eager for it . There is still another side . One Southern senator said to me recently , " It 's almost a wash for Southern sen  --  ators . He 'll bring out the poor and blacks , who vote in small numbers , and that 's a plus . On the other hand , the people who feel intensely against him will also be brought out , and that will hurt some in the South . " ISPOKE to another Democratic senator  --  one who is partial to Ken  --  nedy and is not running for reelection in 1980 . " The first thing to remem  --  ber is that everybody 's looking out for themselves , " he said . " Some would feel that maybe they 're better off with Carter -- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nominee . They may be able to survive Carter ; they may not be able to survive Kennedy . I think a guy figures , ' My voting rec  --  ord is different from Kennedy 's . Ken  --  nedy is too liberal ; philosophically , I 'm more attuned to Carter . I do n't have to defend Carter 's positions as against my positions . ' I think Carter 's game frightens them a little ? ' I 'm going to whip his ass . ' They know it 's going to he a tough campaign . they worry about Chappaquiddick . There 's something else : politicians are very timid guys . They 're not sure they want a guy who comes on as strong as Ted does . They worry about what happens with the rising of the decibels . Politicians used to like excitement ; now most of them are gray , want to play it safe . They 're afraid of the special inter  --  ests  --  the gun lobby , the anti-ahortion  --  ists , the anti-tax reformers . Those groups are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he against Kennedy . There is a feeling Kennedy would arouse the dogs in a campaign , and a lot of politicians do n't want the excitement . " ANOTHER Democratic senator ex- plained the Capitol Hill calcu  --  lations as follows : " There 's a power  --  ful compulsion when you 're up for a House or Senate seat to take yourself out of the Presidential thing . Every one 's consumed by their own fortunes . They need the help of everyone . For them to risk alienating any faction at this stage would he highly unusual . " I asked him about the shift in cli  --  mate that had occurred on Capitol Hill not long after Kennedy made it clear that he would run . He replied , " I think some of those who were wanting Kennedy to head the ticket are sobering up as they see how tough it 's going to he and how tough an experience Ted is going to he subjected to . These guys want to stand off and see how that storm is weathered . They all get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make sure that their original thesis survives the test . The two most oh- vious factors that changed the climate were , one , that the Kennedy challenge makes the Carter people pull them- selves together , and , two , that the Car- ter people are getting to what they 're good at  --  campaigning , rather than governing . Also , what you see coming out is sympathy for Carter and the desire for regular order , the natural inclination of regular Democrats to he discomfited by a fight . They say they 're for Ted , but ' Why now ? Why not 1984 ? ' If they 're state chairmen or other Party officials , they themselves are threatened : they could be thrown out if there 's a split . The safest haven for them is the regular order . So there 's a large element of wait-and  --  see on Kennedy . " I li DEMOCRATIC senator who is up for reelection said to me , " I real  --  ly think it would be a distraction from my campaign for me to endorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into every meeting  --  I attend seven or eight a day  --  and be asked , ' Why are you sup  --  porting President Carter , when he 's bought that crazy oil-company phi  --  losophy and lifted price controls and is letting the oil companies rip us off ? ' Or ' Why are you supporting Ken  --  nedy , with his crazy spending pro  --  grams ' I think half of my time would have to be devoted to a defense of my position on the Presidential race . Still , I realize that I 'm going to have to an  --  swer questions on whether I agree with Kennedy or Carter on this or that . " COME Democrats on Capitol Hill COME prefer Kennedy to Carter as President because they sec him , for all the talk about his liberalism , as a pragmatic politician , as someone they can work with , as someone who under  --  stands Congress and knows how to work within it . Some would prefer Carter because they are not certain they want a President who is good at working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol Hill noticed that Carter attended a World Series game with House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill and asked him to he the chair  --  man of the Democratic Convention  --  an offer that O'Neill accepted . " That 's smart long-run politics , " said one sena  --  tor who is not partial to Carter . " It shows that they 're thinking several months ahead , that they 're laying in acorns for the winter . " Obviously , O'Neill , a Massachusetts man , has ties that pull him to Kennedy , but , as an old-fashioned Democrat , he is loyal to the President . As Speaker of the House , he is better off not taking any position His being made chairman of the Con  --  vention freed him from pressures to choose , and for that he was said to be grateful . W ) HEN I went to see one Demo- cratic senator in late October , Senator Daniel Inouye , Democrat of Hawaii , was coming out of the sena  --  tor 's office . Inouye , who is up for re  --  election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend a " Friends of Carter/Mondale " dinner that eve  --  ning . The senator had declined . WORD of maneuvers in the strug  --  gle travels quickly through the cloakrooms of Capitol Hill . And it travelled quickly one day that Jimmy Carter had telephoned Senator Dale Bumpers , Democrat of Arkansas , and said that he and Rosalynn had just been talking about Bumpers and his wife , Betty , at breakfast that morning . And that the President added that hr hoped Bumpers would he with him . Bumpers told the President that he was not making any commitments . What gave the story special point was that Bumpers , a moderate Southerner and a former governor , who is up for reelec  --  tion to the Senate in 1980 , is widely considered a good possibility to he Ken  --  nedy 's running mate . The penchant for speculation is such that discussions of who Kennedy 's running mate would be began in September . DAN RosTENKOwsicr , a Democratic representative from Illinois , is the chief deputy majority whip of the House and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , in effect , Mayor Richard Daley 's ambassador to Washington , and now , like other Chicago politicians and the remains of the Cook County organiza  --  tion , he has a tenuous relationship with the city 's mayor , Jane Byrne . When I go to see Rostenkowski in late Oc  --  tober , Mayor Byrne has indicated pub  --  licly that she will support Carter , and both Carter and Kennedy are making a big thing of trying to win her sup  --  port . ( Some people in the Carter camp have warned that Mrs. Byrne is high  --  ly unpredictable , and that it is very likely that if she finally endorses some  --  one it will be Kennedy , so Carter should not make such a big thing of it . ) Therefore , Dan Rostenkowski is on the spot . It is said that he wants to " stay loose . " ( So do some others in Cook County , for reasons of their own . When Carter went to Chicago recent  --  ly for a Democratic fund-raising din  --  ner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now a Chicago alderman , commented to a reporter , ? We 're just startin ' to squeeze the guy . " ) Rostenkowski has been telling people in the Carter and Kennedy camps that he 's going to wait to see what O'Neill is going to do  --  that , after all , O'Neill is part of the leader  --  ship and he himself is part of the lead  --  ership . Rostenkowski is a large man , with reddish hair and a husky voice . " Carter is the contrast now of what he 's been for the last three years , " he says . " He 's being aggressively political . Where 's he been ? I 'm happy that he 's seen that Washington politics has to be played maybe with a kid glove , but the hand has to be in the glove . He 's starting to be a President . When he came to Washington , he wanted his aides to get around Washington in taxis . You had the Ways and Means Commit  --  tee " ? Rostenkowski is a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get a cab . " I point out that Blumenthal , the for  --  mer Secretary of the Treasury , like all Cabinet members , had a limousine available for official appointments . Rostenkowski says , " Well , if it was n't Mike , it was some Treasury of  --  ficial . I 've had some strong conversa  --  tions with the President about this . He 's started to play ' Hail to the Chief ' now , but he never should have stopped playing it . This is Carter 's last cam  --  paign . That 's how he 'll have to go at it  --  no holds barred . You 're starting to get people to choose sides . Everybody is going to start making assessments about what they 've had under Carter and what it would be like under Ken  --  nedy . Some of my colleagues are start  --  ing to say Carter has n't been that bad . " I ask him if people in the House have been shifting their assessments . Rostenkowski replies , " I think the realization of fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has become more aggressive as President  --  the realization that they 're not going to roll Jimmy Carter over  --  is making some people sit hack . On the other hand , it 's so much more con  --  venient for a candidate running for re  --  election to run on a platform of new hope , new ideas , new leadership . They could do that with Carter in 1976 . A candidate could do that with Brown , with Kennedy , but a candidate run  --  ning with Carter now would have to defend what Carter has done . The fellow that 's running for reelection that does n't have the comfort of my district " ? Rostenkowski got more than eighty per cent of the vote in each of the last three elections ? " the tenure that I have , may want to talk about the dreams of tomorrow . " What , then , I ask , does a member of Congress do ? " He 's going to play the string out as long as he possibly can , " Rostenkowski replies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as possible . He wants to be on the win  --  ner 's side . Under the conditions that exist today , you ca n't blame him . " He leans forward in his chair and adds , " Besides , if you 're good at your job , even if you 're on the losing side , the winner needs you . " Following my visit with Rostenkow  --  ski , Jane Byrne endorsed Kennedy , thus beating out the Cook County Cen  --  tral Committee , which was also plan  --  ning to endorse him ; Rostenkowski had lunch at the White House with the President ; Rostenkowski tried to delay an endorsement of Kennedy by the Cook County organization ; the orga  --  nization endorsed Kennedy . After all this happened , Rostenkowski said to me , " The organization was premature . We do n't know how the voters are going to react to Kennedy . For me , it 's very hard to drop an incumbent President . But support what the committee has done . I 've always done that . But I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time , I wo n't do that . I 'm not running as committed , uncommitted . I 'm not run  --  ning , period . " I ASKED one prominent mayor who had endorsed Carter why he had done so . He replied , " The White House can do me a lot of good over the next few months , and if he Totes I ca n't believe Kennedy 's not going to need me . " ADEMOCRATIC senator says over the phone , " I 'm staying out of it , out of sheer cowardice . " AN important labor leader , at a din- ner , says he 's staying neutral . " I have other fish to fry , " he says . If the President has a serious challenger , the labor leader 's bargaining power with the President  --  and with the challeng  --  er is increased . " The more the mer rier , " he says , smiling . The assumption of the union lead  --  ers who are remaining neutral  --  the group includes the leaders of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file will largely support Kennedy . But the lead  --  ers have their own exigencies . A num  --  ber of wage settlements are coming up in which the Administration will play a role ; for the U.A.W. , there was the question of federal financial aid for the Chrysler Corporation . Vice-President Mondale has been expending a good deal of effort with union executive hoards , trying to rekindle the old Hum  --  phrey ties . Recently  --  actually , on the day Kennedy made his formal an  --  nouncement that he was a candidate  --  Muriel Humphrey , Hubert Humphrey 's widow , stood on the White House lawn , with Mondale by her side , and announced that she supported the Car  --  ter-Mondale ticket . ) As for the Administration 's decision to help Chrysler , a U.A.W. official says , " Strauss and Mondale were very cagey . They took the leadership up to the mountaintop and showed them how good the goodies are . " Some union people find them  --  selves making calculations not unlike those made by members of Congress . As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up next year . Elections of delegates to the U.A.W. convention are to be held next spring , around the time of several important primaries . A U.A.W. official says , " If a guy figures that what he wants is to be vice-president of the un  --  ion , he might drag his heels on the Presidential thing , because otherwise it might complicate his life . Therefore , some guys who would be for Kennedy are not declaring . " AMAN I know here works for someone of some importance in the Administration and is also close to someone who is close to Kennedy . This man feels he must take care how much time he spends with his friend , and un  --  der what circumstances , so as not to make his boss , to whom he is utterly loyal , uneasy . ? THERE are many levels to the Democrats ' struggle in Washing  --  ton . One is the obvious strategic and public-relations considerations in the Kennedy camp 's luring away of Ad  --  ministration officials . A certain amount of this was to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up largely of Democrats , and a certain number of them have old ties to Ken  --  nedy , or would like to have future ones . In recognition of this , Jody Powell , the President 's press secre  --  tary , having bitterly attacked Dick Clark for leaving his job as ambas  --  sador-at-large in charge of refugee affairs to join the Kennedy camp , hedged against eventualities by telling reporters in a background briefing that , of course , more " defections " were ex  --  pected . The Administration has made it clear that people in it are expect  --  ed not just to try to govern but also to support the President 's reelection . Some people are willing to do the first but are less enthusiastic about the sec  --  ond . People working at agencies far removed from the White House tell of hearing that their political loyal  --  ties have been inquired about . Married couples who work for the Administra  --  tion have to consider the effect on the career of one partner if the other leaves to work for Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about is that Kennedy has for a long time been the recipient of memorandums and information from people within the Administration who are dissatisfied with certain poll-des . BY comparison , Republicans are al  --  most mellow . I Went to see a moderate Republican senator one after  --  noon in October . He said he went along with the general assumption that his party 's nomination was Reagan 's unless Reagan did something to lose it . He continued , " I do n't find the divisive quality to this campaign that I have found to every one of our other cam  --  paigns since 1964-2 ' I asked him what he thought was the reason for this . " It may just he that it 's early , " he replied . " But I also think that the ter  --  rible divisiveness of 1976 , and the fact that most people say that that 's what cost the G.O.P. the White House , has been a sobering experience . " I suggested that if I had said to him four years ago that Ronald Reagan was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been sitting there so calmly . " At that point , he was n't , " he re  --  plied . " Besides , I 'm not about to be a part of allowing the Party to become just a Sunbelt club . This is one of the things we 've got to thrash out . " It seems that the moderate Republi  --  cans are in part bowing to what might be the inevitable and , if they are up for reelection , trying to avoid the wrath of the Party 's conservatives , and per  --  haps even work out a deal with Rea  --  gan , who might need them . ( Thus , Jacob Javits , of New York , who is up for reelection  --  but has not let it be known whether he will run  --  said on " Face the Nation " in September that he could live with any of the candi  --  dates , including Reagan . ) ? Thursday , October 25th , N -- .1 George Bush is addressing a luncheon of the Washington Press Club at the Sheraton-Carlton Hotel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ago . ( Not far away , John Anderson , a House Republican from Illinois , who has also declared for the Presidency , is addressing the National Press Club . ) Bush is virtually nowhere in the polls now , and few people give him a chance . His supporters here say that he is doing well in Iowa ( where he has spent a great deal of time ) , in Puerto Rico , and even in New Hampshire . Bush has held a larger number of important jobs than most people who run for the Presi  --  dency  --  director of the C.I.A. , head of the United States mission in Peking , Ambassador to the United Nations , Re  --  publican Party chairman , representative from Texas  --  and he was among those who were thought to he considered for the Vice-Presidency when Richard Nixon had to fill the vacancy left by Spiro Agnew . Such a string of experi  --  ences is likely to leave a man thinking he is at least as well qualified to be President as others who make the at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does Bush in number of government jobs held , and is another story , has also had that thought . ) Bush is tall and handsome and has a slightly crooked smile , and reporters who have travelled with him come away saying that he is a very nice man , but they also say they ca n't much remember what he said . As he goes about seeking Republican support , Bush stresses his experience as a Texas businessman over his roots in New England , where he grew up . Today , Bush begins by malting some not terribly funny remarks , in a game attempt at self-deprecating humor . It is as if he felt he may be just a bit too elegant , a bit too patrician , a hit too polished for what people expect in politicians , anti he must show that he can he one of the boys . Then he swings into his prepared statement , in which he describes the nineteen-nighties as " the most dangerous decade in the past forty years . " He points out that Carter ran as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and says he hopes that the fact that Carter is now viewed as " weak and ineffective " has not " given decency a bad name . " And then , in case Ken  --  nedy turns out to be the problem , he attacks what he calls " the Camelot syndrome in modern media politics . " He outlines his own economic pro  --  gram : limit the growth of spending , remove the excesses of regulation , build productivity by cutting taxes , balance the budget . He makes a jab at John Connally , without mentioning his name . This is a little convention that Republicans , at least for the time , are observing . He points out that Ted  --  dy Roosevelt did n't say , " Talk tough and carry a swagger stick . " He says that the " true toughness " is " mental toughness , " and that the American people know this , and that this is why " I 'm going to win the nomination and the Presidency next year . " He is not a compelling speaker  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thusiasm , definiteness , into his speaking style . As he reaches the close of his prepared remarks , he says , " Some others might be more exciting orators . But we 're not trying to elect a class valedictorian ; we 're trying to elect somebody who can restore confidence in this country  --  run it . " And he gives his definition of leadership , which is what all the candidates seem to be say  --  ing they are for : " experience ; convic  --  tion ; the ability to inspire confidence in the people you lead ; the ability to dis  --  agree and still command respect ; the ability to persuade without bullying ; enough humility to avoid the unneces  --  sary error ; the ability to attract ex  --  cellence and to bring out the best those people can offer . " As Bush answers questions , he again tries to persuade the audience to take him seriously : " I know I 'm going to win this nomination . You just watch . " He is asked if he is gaining ground in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's getting better , " ht says . " You had no reason to take me seriously a year ago . Now today you do , some of you grudg  --  ingly . " He says this with good humor . He points out that he has been winning " straw polls " in Iowa ; there have been six thus far , and Bush has won them all . In 1975 , Jimmy Carter , who until then had been little noticed , won a straw poll in Iowa , and so now some are taking that as the model . " We 've got a classy game plan , the best grass  --  roots organization in these early states , " Bush says , " and that 's how you build name recognition . " He grows animated and waves his arms . " I 'm going to win it by seeing very little of you and a hell of a lot of Iowa and New Hamp  --  shire . " ? ON Wednesday , October 31st , two days after Kennedy 's brother-in-law Stephen Smith announced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy 's Senate office , Room 2241 of the Dirksen Office Building , is a madhouse. job applicants , tourists crowd the reception room . One of two women who handle the phones ( the line is often busy these days ) is politely thanking someone for offering Kennedy a place to stay during the campaign . Former Kennedy staff mem  --  bers are coming hack . Roles in the campaign are still being sorted out . Telephones have not yet been installed in the campaign headquarters in down  --  town Washington . Campaign strate  --  gists are scattered around the city . There arc logistical problems to be solved , advance people to be suddenly found and sent into the field . There are questions of baggage handling and hotel rooms . The travel schedule keeps changing . Strategists arc still sorting out the requests for appearances and their own ideas as to when Kennedy should appear where . The schedulers have to mesh the political exigencies with commitments already made and with the Senate duties that Kennedy will still want to perform . Morris Dees , who was Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is trying to figure out what mecha  --  nisms  --  concerts , dinners , mailings , and so on  --  to use . Martin Kati , the di  --  rector of finance and administration , is trying to figure out what funds are on hand and to budget money for advance work , for travel , for fund  --  raising , and so on . Paul Kirk , the national political director , and Carl Wagner , director of field operations , are going over lists of people who are available for organizing , and deciding what states they should be sent to . Kennedy will go to West Virginia and Buffalo this coming weekend , and so far sixty-three reporters , an ex  --  ceptional number for any political fig  --  ure except a President , have signed up to go along . When Carter was flying around Iowa in January , 1976 , only a handful of reporters accompanied him . What will amount to about a six  --  teen-million-dollar effort ( just for the primaries ) , involving fifty states and four hundred and thirty-five congres  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The idea that the Kennedys have a " well-oiled machine " at the ready is mistaken , as it was in 1968 . Kennedy people stress how much of a head start the White House has had ; they say that winning Iowa will be very difficult . ( When it appeared that his surrogate forces would lose Florida , Kennedy said that Iowa would be the first real test . ) At this point in the campaign , each side has reason both to play up its chances ( so as to attract , or hold , people and donors and psycho  --  logical edge ) and to play them down ( so as not to create expectations that are not fulfilled ) , and at this point both sides are doing both . In one corner of a large room where eight people are working , in Kennedy 's Senate office suite , Carey Parker , Ken  --  nedy 's chief legislative assistant , is get  --  ting together " issues hooks " for the campaign  --  black notebooks containing material on Kennedy 's record , the is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  lenged , the issues on which he will challenge Carter . Parker , who is in his mid-forties , is a tall , thin , soft-spoken man ; he has worked for Kennedy for ten years and is generally con  --  sidered one of the most brilliant staff people on Capitol Hill . There have been numerous meetings over the past few weeks to discuss which issues to stress . The consensus is that the main themes are " leadership , " the economy , and energy , but the questions are how to develop and illustrate the leadership theme , and how specific to get on the other issues . This is one big challenge of the Kennedy campaign : his differences with Carter on the is  --  sues are not enormous ; what he has to assert is that he is more likely to get things done . To the extent that it can , the Carter campaign will try to hold Kennedy to the issues , suggesting that there is really no rationale for his can  --  didacy . The Kennedy campaign plan at this point is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now being worked on  --  goes , and then to have Kennedy make a speech to dis  --  pel the idea that there are not differ  --  ences between Carter and Kennedy on the economy and to show that Ken  --  nedy would be better able to carry out policies than Carter is . The need to demonstrate that one is a better leader is an easier thing to understand than to commit to paper as a strategy . Kennedy 's hopes lie in the possibil  --  ity that people will simply assimilate this idea almost unconsciously . Carter 's hopes lie in the possibility that they will not . Kennedy 's people assume that he will be attacked as a big spender , as soft on defense , as someone who talked about national health insurance but could not get a bill on it out of sub  --  committee ( Kennedy and the Carter Administration never agreed on a bill , in part because they did n't want to ) , the Kennedy people know there will be at least oblique attacks on his char  --  acter . Ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voting record is being combed for in  --  consistencies , on the assumption that a similar exercise is being conducted at the White House . And the Kennedy forces figure that Carter will have his own vulnerability on the matter of shifting positions . Some people in the Carter camp think that Kennedy made a mistake in his speech in Memphis last December when he criticized Carter 's plans to increase military spending  --  by three percentage points over inflation  --  and to hold down increases for social programs . Mondale countered the next day with a speech in which he said that an anti-inflation program is also a so  --  cial program . In the weeks following the Memphis meeting , the Carter Ad  --  ministration found more money for so  --  cial programs , and Kennedy issued a press release in which he said he ap  --  proved the Administration 's attempt to hold the new budget deficit to less than thirty billion dollars . In Septem  --  ber of this year , the political climate surrounding the issue of defense spend  --  ing having changed , Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in defense spending for 1980 . ( The vote was seventy-eight to nineteen . The Senate also went on record , by a much narrower vote , in support of increases in 1981 and 1982 of five percentage points over infla  --  tion  --  a move that Kennedy opposed , as did Carter . ) At this point , an early speech is planned to deal with the idea that Kennedy may be " soft on de  --  fense , " Carter and Kennedy will , to some degree , be trying to adopt each other 's constituencies . For some time , the Car  --  ter strategy has been to hew to the middle , figuring that in the final elec  --  tion that is where most of the voters are . Now Carter must do what he can to hold the Party 's constituent groups . Kennedy must march toward the cen  --  ter , so as to avoid , the theory goes , winning the nomination only to lose the general election , and he must try to do so without being labelled a hypo  --  crite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been prag  --  matic politicians . John Kennedy 's Pres  --  idential campaign was criticized for be  --  ing devoid of content . Robert Kennedy was accused of expediency when he talked about " law and order " in the course of the 1968 Indiana primary . ? N the end of the day nn which I have been to Kennedy 's office , I talk to Jody Powell at the White House , He has just come from a meet  --  ing to plan the President 's speech , scheduled for December 4th , announc  --  ing his candidacy for reelection . The President and his aides are described by a number of people as more upbeat than they have been in a long time . It is said that the Kennedy challenge got their juices flowing  --  that the President emerged from a period of self-pity , which had lasted through much of the summer , of feeling trapped by matters he could not control , and of believing that there was indeed " malaise " in the land and that it was in part his fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration in Con  --  congress . Carter and his associates are glad to be back to campaigning . One of Carter 's advisers says that Kennedy drew out Carter 's combativeness , mak  --  ing him a better President and a better candidate . They have felt for some time that Kennedy is more vulnerable than the polls and much of the pub  --  lic commentary have indicated ; some of the Carter people have been spelling out sequences of events which had Car  --  ter winning . But the pressures of trying to govern  --  Carter will be judged on his record and is eager to show that he can get things dune  --  and also cam  --  paign impinge on the White House . " It 's hard , " says one person who works there . " You 're pursuing the course that has been determined on certain issues , implementing the President 's policies , and , on the other hand , trying to an  --  ticipate what the opposition is going to do , and develop strategies so that you 're not always on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategize about and anticipate . A good deal of thought has gone into the elements of what we expect Kennedy 's approach and issues are going to be , and how to anticipate those and how to respond ! ' More  --  over , the President is facing another round of budget-making decisions that , given current economic restraints and inflation , are going to cause even more agonizing choices than last year 's exer  --  cise did , and risks of antagonizing con  --  stituent groups . Because of the political situation , one of the President 's advis  --  ers says , this year 's budget process is " more poignant . " In my conversation with Powell , he says , " The announcement speech is a forcing mechanism for the basic ap  --  proach for the whole campaign writ large : What is your basic approach ? What do you choose to emphasize ? We clearly forced Kennedy to move before he wanted to move . That 's a problem for him and also a problem for us . They seem to be wanting to take one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carter people had might as well throw up their hands and quit . They tried that in September , and they 're having one more shot at it now . Clearly , neither Jane Byrne nor Dick Clark wanted v. do what they did the way they did in " I ask him how he knows this . " It just makes sense , " he replies . " Neither of them looked very good . " Powell points out with pleasure a news story that appeared in the Atlanta Constitution that day saying that Ken  --  nedy had invited the Reverend Martin Luther King , Sr. , to his office and asked for his support , and that King , who has supported Carter , declined . Powell says , " I 'm sure they 've got a few more salted away somewhere . We 've got to prevent him from creating the stampede picture over the next two to three weeks . We have one thing that will beat it  --  the straw poll in Iowa next Saturday . " ( Carter , as had been expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ames . The results were based on which side got more supporters to buy tickets . The Kennedy people , expecting defeat , played the event down . ) Powell con  --  tinues , " And we have one or two oth  --  er things in mind , If we can brakr the stampede this time , then he 's got to have a second act . Right now , he 's on a ' Look at me , do n't I just sorta make you feel better ' sort of thing . There 's got to he more to it than that . If they ca n't get the bandwagon rolling , then he 's losing his rationale for running . As long as the myth that the nomination was his for the asking was credible , that 's one thing . Then there is no party-splitting fight , be  --  cause there is no fight . But now he no longer has a rationale  --  or not the ra  --  tionale he said . " Powell returns to the subject of the considerations shaping the President 's campaign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bluntest terms , " he says , " is what should the President say about himself . Others could say other things . What contrasts should we draw ? Kennedy clearly would like to Avoid the drawing of issues . We 've done some work on where he might choose to go when he has to deal with specifics . That 's one of the reasons I get the feeling they 're not as ready as they 'd like to he . There are some real inconsistencies , and some important things on which he 's endorsed what we 've done on energy and the econo  --  my . By their saying they do n't want to stress issues , but leadership , that not only plays to Kennedy 's strength  --  the strong , forceful Kennedy thing , and the nostalgia thing  --  but he 's also trying to run away from the record . You can try to define the campaign by not having the record an issue , but you ca n't try to change the record , and that 's what they 've tried to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an issue . " I ask Powell if he thinks Kennedy is vulnerable on , for example , defense . He replies , " He 's vulnerable on that basic trust-and-confidence issue . He 's one thing today and something else tomorrow , and that 's his basic weak  --  ness anyway  --  trust and confidence , all the sort of personal baggage . So why-would they give us a chance to go after him on that kind of issue ? You have to ask yourself how much of that is the sort of thing you want to get into , and is it a legitimate thing to get into , It clearly is a legitimate thing to deal with someone who is inconsistent , who fuzzes things up , who runs for President and has said things that do n't fit together . That goes to a basic ques  --  tion about the person . " R om 318 , the Senate Caucus Room , November 1st . Howard Baker is announcing his Presidential candidacy . A large number of Repub  --  lican senators are here , some because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is , after all , the Senate Minority Leader . Baker tried to be Vice-President , beginning in 1968 , and he , too , was among those mentioned as a replacement for Agnew , and after Ford passed him over in 1976 he said , " If I ever run for national office again , it wo n't be for Vice-President . " Ba  --  ker , too , has had to move up his timing . He apparently hoped to star in the Senate debate on the SALT treaty and then announce his candidacy , but the SALT treaty has been delayed in getting before the Senate , and he has been ad  --  vised that he had better get an organi  --  zation together , that the other can  --  didates are not sitting around . One of the senators here to witness the announcement is William Cohen , of Maine , who for some time has been promoting the idea that Howard Ba  --  ker is the moderates ' best hope of sav  --  ing the Party from the conservatives . This Saturday , there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohen has worked hard to see to it that Baker wins . A number of Presidential candidacies have been launched in the Caucus Room , but this is also , of course , where Baker became famous for his role in the Ervin-committee hearings on Water  --  gate  --  a role that remains marked by controversy . Some see Baker as gifted at legislative compromise ; others won  --  der whether he has any compass . To  --  day , he is wearing a navy-blue suit , a white shirt , and gold-rimmed glasses . He begins straightforwardly : " I am a candidate for President of the Unit  --  ed States . " A banner on the marble wall behind him bears his name and his slogan , which is presumably meant to carry a subliminal message : " Tough , Honest . Right for the 80 's . " Baker says , " Throughout our history , days of trouble have turned into years of pride through a renaissance of the American spirit . " He says that " we will recover in pride  --  hut only if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that America has lost its " margin for error . " He says that " our superiority in strategic arms ... is gone . " He says that our abundance of energy is gone , that our advantage in productivity and our confidence in the future are gone . Like Bush , he swipes at his opponents without using names . He says , " It is obvious that one of five men will be our next President . " Then he says , " Surely we know we can not withstand still more Washington inex  --  perience . " ( Carter , Reagan . ) He says that " government by ideological reflex , left or right , will not bring the unity we need . " ( Reagan , Kennedy . ) He says that " a President can not govern without trust and ... trust never comes from bluster . " ( Connally . ) He says , " And surely we know that we need a leader for tomorrow if the goal is a new generation of confidence . " ( Baker . ) He continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility , but as well with the personal certainty that I am ready . " He lists some more of his qualifications : that he can " give us the confidence to stand tall again ; " can " curb useless regulation and spending ... assure energy independence .. . cope with inflation ; " that he can pro  --  vide tax relief ; that he is articulate enough , tough enough , honest enough , compassionate enough , young enough , and experienced enough . He asks that he be judged on his performance on Watergate and in the forthcoming SALT debate , and he makes it definite that he will work to defeat the treaty . Some of the Republican senators with  --  hold their applause when he says this . " T do n't honestly know whether I can heat both Jimmy Carter and Teddy Kennedy on this treaty , " he says , and he concludes , " Watch me . Judge me . Then come with me . Let 's reach for the future and make it ours . " During the question period , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other candidates . He is asked if his opposition to the SALT treaty is politically motivated , and is part of an effort to make amends to the Republican right for having sup  --  ported the Panama Canal treaties . It is a question to which the response is not likely to be " Yes . " " No , " he says . He says , " I 'm dedi  --  cated to the SALT process , " and " I 'm convinced we got nuthargained on this treaty and it should be amend-td ; " he calls for the sorts of amend  --  ments that the Administration says would require renegotiation of the treaty . He acknowledges that Reagan is the front-runner . He is asked where he thinks he might he able to beat Reagan . After a long pause , he says , " I would have to overtake him by the time we 're in the middle primaries . There are lots of states out there and I have lots of plans . " ? ON the evening of Sunday , Novem  --  ber 4th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gathered , the Bush man is jubilant , and surprised  --  that Bush won the Maine straw poll last night , defeating Baker and six others . He says that the Bush campaign will have to get Baker out early , so that someone can become the alternative to Reagan early and that that person wo n't be Connally . The Connally man agrees with the Bush man that Baker has virtually no organization and that there is feuding among his strategists . The Connally man says that Connally will come within eleven points of the front-run  --  ner in New Hampshire , and that that person might he Bush , not Reagan . The Reagan man says that Reagan 's biggest challenge as front-runner is to live up to expectations  --  not to falter  --  and that the plan is to announce the candidacy relatively /ate , lie Iow , win the nomination in about three months , and then take a respite until the final campaign . The Reagan man also sug  --  gests that the Reagan people in Maine threw votes to Bush so as to knock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two days before Kennedy is to for  --  mally announce his candidacy , I have an interview with him over lunch in his ( - Ace . During the past weekend , he has made a campaign trip to Charleston , West Virginia , and to Buffalo , and today he seems tired and has a slight cold . The wind of opinion has taken a sudden shift , and this week 's certainty is that Kennedy will have no easy time of it in trying to de  --  feat Carter . Much is being made of his performance on a CBS special about him that was on the air last night  --  the fact that he stumbled around on some answers , did not seem to have his thoughts together , and provided some unsatisfying ones about Chappa  --  quiddick . It was not to be expected that he would have anything new to say about that  --  he can not by this time  --  and it had been known all along , and written , that Kennedy of  --  ten speaks in incomplete sentences . So did his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' inar  --  ticulate ratio . In delivering Formal speeches , he can be eloquent , and in private conversation he can be bare comprehensible , but he can also be comprehensible in private conversation and in interviews and highly articulate in spontaneous give-and-take on the Senate floor . Now that he is an actual candidate , rather than an abstraction , however , things that had been known about him but perhaps , as one of his colleagues has suggested , brushed aside are viewed differently . The Kennedy camp expected that once he became a candidate his liabilities would receive greater scrutiny , but it is doubtful whether they were prepared for the force and suddenness with which the wind would shift . It was assumed that on Chappaquiddick the questions would he the same , and that the answers , sat  --  isfying or not , would be the same , and that there might he one more round of stories on the subject , and that then , as the campaign got under way , atten  --  tion would turn elsewhere . One of Kennedy 's aides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the campaign on the road , have him deal with audi  --  ences  --  which they presume him to he good at  --  and start shaping and re  --  fining the issues , seeing what works , and forcing the White House to re  --  spond . " We 've been in a kind of sitz  --  krieg , " the aide says . I ask Kennedy if he is relieved that the campaign is getting under way . " I 've really never second-guessed the decision , " he replies . " I made up my mind this summer . I suppose there was a set of circumstances that could have altered it or changed it . I 'm ac  --  tually relieved that the final aspects of the campaign have started . I think I had some consideration that I could re  --  main in the Senate during the debates on windfall profits and SALT , but quite clearly the acceleration of interest in the campaign , and the Administration 's : cations , and the need to organize , and the firmness in my own mind led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter 's standing in the Party or in the country . There were many people who came and spoke to me about his standing . The issue was the reason for that standing  --  it was the realization , from my own evalua  --  tion and discussions , that the standing was because of a failure to come to grips with the concerns of Americans . If his position in the polls had been the result of his setting forth visions for this country and coming to grips and setting forth in a bold and compassion  --  ate way , then no matter where he was in the polls I would not have run . would have stood on the barricades with hint . " I ask him whether the campaign is proving rougher than he expected . " No , " he replies . " I knew it would be a hard and difficult campaign . knew , obviously , that I 'd he tested on my positions on issues and my vision for this country as well as on personal matters . " I ask him if he expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I did . I expect  --  ed that there would be  --  I also knew that there was nothing new that would develop about those aspects , because , obviously , if there was anything new that would come out it would end the candidacy effectively . " I ask him how damaging he thinks these personal issues are . " It 's hard for me to make any as  --  sessments , " he replies . I ask him if he feels he has a prob  --  lem in establishing a rationale for his campaign . " I 'll spell that out in my announce  --  ment statement , and effectively so , " he replies . " That 's what the purpose of the statement will be . I think we 'll be effective in doing that in the next few weeks and months , I think the differ  --  ences will be both implicit and explicit in the statement , in running for the Presidency , and will develop in the course of the campaign . " I ask him if he sees a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tional Democratic constituency groups and also trying to win a general elec  --  tion . " I do n't think so , " he replies . " The central concern in the country is not only who is bearing the burden of the failure to deal effectively with infla  --  tion  --  the needy and the elderly and the disadvantaged  --  but I think there is a sense across the spectrum that a vision of America is not being spelled out , that the goals are not being established , that there is not effective coordination of the government and galvanization of the people . Meanwhile , there is talk about ' malaise ' of the people that the problems are too difficult to deal with  --  from our national leadership , The for mer analysis is much more consistent not only with the people who are bear  --  ing the burden hut with the over  --  whelming majority of the people , who feel that there is a failure . " I ask Kennedy if he thinks there is a danger that he might raise expecta  --  tions too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very realistic about the complexity of the problems . People understand there is no magic solution , that no single piece of legislation will solve the problems . What they want is a feeling of prog  --  ress in which they are involved  --  that you do n't overpromise , that you do n't try to solve the problems with massive programs but that you involve them and there is a sense that we 're moving along on these issues . And that does n't exist in this country today . " Does he , then , I ask , concede that the problems are more complicated now than they were before ? " I do n't know that they 're more complicated , " he replies . " People have been led to believe it . Fighting our way out of the Articles of Confederation into the Constitution . The Depression . I do n't think they 're necessarily so . They are complicated , but as Ameri  --  cans were involved in other parts of our history and faced up to the chal  --  lenges , I think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chal  --  lenges , and they 're not being asked to do it . The President 's speech in July " ? the " malaise " speech " made a sig nificant impact on my thinking about the next four years : the way the Presi  --  dent looks at the American people and the future . " I return to the question of raising expectations too high . " I think Americans always have re  --  sponded best when they 're challenged , " Kennedy replies . " Obviously , the ques  --  tion is how one perceives leadership : obviously , it 's releasing the enormous forces in this society who want to he productive and be involved in the solution of the problems . A leader wants to be able to release those ener  --  gies and play a critical role in setting out the agenda . I think those forces out there  --  the elderly , youth , church groups  --  have a synergistic effect on each other , and that moves this nation . The energy is what 's involved in mov  --  ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think that 's overpromising ; I think it 's releasing the energy and the hope to deal with these problems in a positive and con  --  structive way . " I ask him about the view that there are deeper divisions among groups in this country than ever before , and that each group is getting more sophisticated in finding methods to push its view , thus making consensus on many issues hard to achieve . " I agree with that , " Kennedy re  --  plies . " And I think those groups are strengthened . And when you do n't have clearly established a vision and sense of direction for this country , then it releases those forces . This country does n't stand still . One of the failures of this Administration has been to fail to recognize that this country wants to see a President do well , that the Congress wants to see a President do well , and that they want to see some  --  one who can work with the institu  --  tions . If there is a perception in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals , then the regional  --  ism , narrow self-interest , special inter  --  ests contaminate the purposes of our society . I think having set out a vision and purpose and goal for this country , it 's important to develop a team that can work on these goals and work with the institutions that can impact them . That 's not been there . I think the chal  --  lenge is that American people who have confidence in themselves , confi  --  dence in their country , are perhaps cynical and skeptical about their coun  --  try . The challenge is whether they would have a sense of confidence dur  --  ing the next twelve months that you 're able to establish these directions and play a part in setting these goals . " Is he , I ask , talking about some sort of formal goals-setting process He replies , " I 'm not talking just about a listing of programs . I started last week , on my trip , and will ad  --  dress in a serious way the major mat  --  ters that face this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next four years  --  a vision for the country , stan  --  dards for the nation . " ? ON November 8th , Jerry Brown comes to Washington to announce his Presidential candidacy at the Na  --  tional Press Club , another place from which a number of candidacies have been announced . Brown has almost been forgotten in all the uproar . The polls show him behind both Kennedy and Carter . In what does not appear to be a marvellous public-relations stroke , on the lectern that he stands behind is a poster that says " wow ! BROWN NOW . " What shows up on the television screens is his head and " WOW ! " In his statement , he says , " My prin  --  ciples are simple : Protect the earth , serve the people , and explore the uni  --  verse . " NBC shows him being asked what he thinks his chances are . He says that the odds are one in three " One in three ? " he is asked . He replies , " One in three . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? ELIZABETH DREW ?
