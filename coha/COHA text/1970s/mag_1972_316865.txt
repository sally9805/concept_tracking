THE MECHANIC <P> Directed by MICHAEL WINNER <P> Screenplay by LEWIS JOHN CARLINO <P> In Mafia patois a mechanic is a hit man . The titular mechanic of this misshapen thriller is Arthur Bishop ( Charles Bronson ) , a name so bland that we must assume the producers were at pains to appease antidefamation groups of virtually every nationality . Bishop is a psychopathic Mr. Fixit , flawlessly efficient at doing in whoever has fallen out of favor with his employers . Emotionless , a loner , Bishop spends hours studying his quarry . <P> The first part of the movie , which concentrates mostly on Bishop 's devices for dispatching his victims , is the best-cold , fast and intricate . Pretty soon , after murdering a Hollywood businessman , Bishop decides to be friend the man 's son ( Jan-Michael Vincent ) and even to tutor him in all the tricks of the profession . The kid has his own personal reasons for playing the star pupil . <P> Unfortunately Winner ( The Jokers ) directs with easily detectable indifference . Bronson , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Valachi Papers because he has less to say and more to do . Vincent looks throughout as if he had just received a humiliating score on an IQ test . When , at one point , he is called upon to say " I live inside my head , " we know that he is talking about a vacant room . <P> J.C .
