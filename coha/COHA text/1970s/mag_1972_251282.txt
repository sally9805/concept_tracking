To study in the U.S. has for generations been the dream of the young in many lands ; currently , 145,000 foreign students are resident in the U.S. , most of them of college age . For those living in Detroit , the dream has lately become a nightmare . In an unprecedented official crackdown , agents of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service have been rounding up foreign students who are working illegally . The INS work rules , mostly ignored earlier , are being enforced because so many native Detroiters are out of jobs themselves . <P> Michigan 's INS Deputy Director Armand Salturelli says the number of citizen complaints increased as the unemployment rate in the state spiraled upward . The March unemployment rate in Detroit went to 8.8% , and reached 9% statewide-both significantly above the 5.9% national unemployment figure . Foreign students who need to work to support themselves must first get special work permits , but even with such a permit they can not work more than 20 hours a week on an off-campus job ( except during summer vacations ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry a full load of semester hours during their stay . Moreover , the permits , say the students , are hard to obtain . <P> Though students from 26 nations are being investigated in the Detroit INS action , and those deported have come from Great Britain , Ghana , Taiwan , Lebanon , Mexico , Jordan and Venezuela , the brunt of the enforcement has fallen on students from India , who make up from one-third to half of the 2,000 foreigners enrolled in the city 's colleges . During a roundup in March , 61 students were interrogated by INS agents ; 48 of them were from India . Of those students caught during the month , 14 have had voluntary departure dates set , 38 were permitted to stay and nine cases are still under review for deportation . <P> The large and well-organized Indian community in Detroit responded to the INS thrust by raising $2,600 in pledges and donations that will be used to pay bail bonds and to help needy students over financial humps . Some of the community 's leaders have complained to Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . Hart called the Detroit crackdown " rather harsh and drastic , " and urged that students from developing countries be allowed to hold jobs " in order to take advantage of the educational system " in the U.S. The State Department , concerned about international repercussions , has denied that Detroit is the start of a national trend . Officials of the Department argue that the Detroit action was in direct response to local pressure , and termed the situation " unique . "
