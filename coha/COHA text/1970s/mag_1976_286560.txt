The bumper sticker on a doctor 's Cadillac in Beverly Hills last week read : <P> FEELING SICK ? CALL YOUR LAWYER . <P> That was the physician 's way of telling the public that it had brought on itself the latest California doctors ' slowdown by suing for excessive malpractice awards . Since the start of the new year , four-fifths of the 11,000 physicians in the Los Angeles area had refused to treat patients , except in the most serious emergencies . In some hospitals , wards were closed and the services of such specialists as orthopedists and neurosurgeons all but unavailable . <P> Malpractice Fund . As in similar medical slowdowns elsewhere in the country , including a four-week walkout in northern California last spring , the doctors are protesting the skyrocketing cost of malpractice insurance that underwriters insist is made necessary by mounting jury awards . Effective Jan. 1 , Travelers Insurance Co. , which covers three-quarters of the area 's doctors , hiked premiums by an average of 400% . <P> For certain high-risk specialties , the increase was even more staggering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthopedist , found that his premiums had suddenly risen from $6,500 to $36,000 a year . He angrily announced that he was quitting his $65,000-a-year practice . Others have pulled up stakes and moved to other states where there are fewer malpractice suits , smaller judgments and thus more reasonable insurance rates . <P> To protect doctors against astronomical malpractice awards for death or total disability-20 of which have exceeded $1 million-California 's Governor Edmund Brown Jr . has backed the creation of a statewide malpractice fund that would collect fixed annual fees averaging $4,000 per doctor and use that money to pay off claims . These now average $36,000 . But Brown wants something in exchange from California 's doctors ; he has asked them to treat more patients under the state 's limited-fee Medi-Cal program , * provide free care for the poor and set up a " medical Peace Corps " for areas of California that are short on medical facilities and personnel . <P> So far , the doctors have balked at Brown 's efforts to link social problems with what to them is the purely economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the California Medical Association : " We do n't feel anyone should put us in a position of a trade-off because we are not playing politics with peoples ' lives or health . " <P> At week 's end both sides remained adamant . It seemed probable that unless the doctors showed a willingness to accept some of the social-responsibility provisions demanded by Brown in a malpractice-insurance reform bill , the legislation had little chance of passage and the slowdown would go on . <P> <P> *The doctors say that they are already treating 85% of Medi-Cal patients .
