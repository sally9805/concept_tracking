txt White House  --  refusal ? to- turn over key tapes to the House Judiciary Committee is renewing a substantial feeling of committee bipartisanship . For the beleaguered Nixon adrninis- - tration , this " entente cordiale " of the committee poses serious pmblems . It could well be the harbinger , some think , of a committee vote on impeachment in five or six weeks . Two weeks ago , all signs indicated that the committee was splintering along partisan lines . Partisan zeal , to be sure , is not totally gone . But the consensus seems to be now that barring the unexpected , the majority Democrats will have at least a core of Republicans voting with them on key subpoena and procedural points each step of the way now . Letter to judge Chief committee counsel John Doar is expected to request ? possibly , Wednesday ? that the committee issue its second subpoena against Mr. Nixon , this time for tapes originally spelled out in a request made Apr1119 . Coming on the heels of mounting calls for resignation or impeachment of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subpoena test is expected to have immediate political consequences . At the least , White House intransigence would put even further pressure on the committee to vote out an impeachment bill of some kind . Meanwhile , reports that President Nixon several weeks back sent a letter to Judge Gerhard A. Gesell of the U.S. District Court in which he wrote that the break-in of the office of Dr. Daniel Ellsberg 's psychiatrist was done under a delegation of presidential authority , has come as a surprise here . Such a letter to Judge Gesell , who will try the break-in case starting June 17 , is considered an important possible defense for the seven defendants . At the same time , in what is eventually expected to be a crucial ruling , District Court Judge John J. Sirica now is considering a motion by the special Watergate prosecutor 's office for tapes and documents pertaining to some 64 White House conversations . All but one of the conversations are believed to involve Mr. Nixon . Also , a final report on an 18%-minute gap in the June 20 , 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 expected to be released by Judge Sirica in about two weeks . The preliminary report held that the gap was caused by a number of deliberate erasures . A report on the // *Committee stiffens // tape from Dr. Michael Hecker of the Sanford Research Institute and prepared for the White House also will be issued about that time . Still , current attention here remains focused on the expected upcoming Judiciary Committee subpoena . The ' committee is seeking some 141 tapes , 66 of them related to ITT and the milk case , and 75 to Watergate . It is expected that whatever formal subpoena request is made , it will be specific and likely involve only a selected number of the tapes . Some Republican committee members , as well as their staff aides , are saying that whatever degree of bipartisanship now exists on the committee is a direct result of the latest White House hard-line posture on the tapes . Deterioration seen " They 've given us little alternative , " grumbles one Republican committee member , who hastens to add that each appearance ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deteriorating position of Mr. Nixon in the House . Another Republican , Rep. Tom Railsback of Illinois , says Congress will " not stand " for Mr. Nixon 's one-sided decision to tell the committee what tapes he will or will not turn over . Mr. Railsback has said he will support a subpoena . In a press interview , second-ranking Republican Robert McClory of Illinois also indicated he , too , would support a subpoena .
