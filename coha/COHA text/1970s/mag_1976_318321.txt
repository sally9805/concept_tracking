A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY <P> by PAUL JOHNSON <P> 556 pages . Atheneum. $13.95 . <P> " A Christian with faith has nothing to fear from the facts , " Paul Johnson writes . Johnson is an Orwellian socialist deeply concerned for liberty , a dyspeptically progressive Roman Catholic , former editor of the left-wing British journal New Statesman , and a believer with a passion for accuracy . He has written a literary rarity , a highly readable , deeply learned , thoroughly fascinating account of 2,000 years of Christian history . <P> There are plenty of contemporary resonances , of course . Does anyone still believe that the hippies and gurus and Woodstocks of the ' 60s were anything new or unusual ? Consider the medieval Pied Piper from Bourges , who called himself Christ and gathered an ecstatic following that then presented itself to the Bishop of Le Puy , its members " stark naked , leaping and somersaulting . " The response was summary : the leader was " killed on the spot . " <P> The sellers of Lockheeds have nothing on ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turn of the 4th century , the Mediterranean basin was torn by a dispute about the necessity for divine grace in man 's salvation . The bishops of North Africa , led by St. Augustine , insisted that human beings could do nothing without divine help . Pelagius , a theologian from foggy Britain come south to preach reform in Rome , believed that man is born spiritually free . God 's grace may give him a push , but essentially he can find his own way to heaven . Augustine 's writings were crucial in labeling Pelagius a heretic . Still , the bishops needed some temporal muscle to run the heretics into exile . Accordingly , these churchmen who believed in the deep corruptibility of man sent some 80 fine Numidian stallions to bribe key cavalry officers into support of their cause . <P> Total Society . Augustine , indeed , is a thorn in Johnson 's side . For Johnson sees Christian history largely as a pendulum , swinging between the repressive " total society " envisioned by Augustine and the individualistic , more private Christianity espoused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early Reformation , Erasmus of Rotterdam . The political analogies are not coincidental . Johnson believes that men can be self-governing . He sympathizes with the views of Erasmus and Pelagius . Indeed , he argues , the essential optimism of such humanists is closer to the message of the Apostle Paul than the deep pessimism of Augustine , who relegated most people to what he called the massa damnata- " the damned mass.
