From Atlanta Bureau Chief Rudolph Ranch : <P> Gene Hudson 's 500-acre farm in Warm Springs was one of the few places in Georgia where most of the talk was not about Jimmy Carter . Roughly 125 men had gathered at the farm on a chilly night for the monthly meeting of the Chitlin ' Club , founded in 1936 . Between liberal swigs of bourbon and peach moonshine , the hardy souls consumed 200 lbs . of boiled hog intestines , which smelled a lot like a thousand dirty socks , and talked mostly of their bygone feats of athletic prowess . Said Hudson : " Most folks come to the Chitlin ' Club to eat and forget their worries . " But the talk did momentarily veer to Carter 's brother Billy . Said a brawny club member : " That Billy is a candy ass if all he drinks is those sissy little 7-ounce beers . Get that grinnin ' gentleman over here eatin ' some chitlins with us , and we 'll find out right fast how tough he is . " <P> Southerners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the region since 1849 . Said North Carolina State Senator Harold Hardison of his friends ' eagerness to attend the Inauguration : " They 'll be there just as sure as a cat 's got climbing gear . " Added Shelby Smith , a retired building contractor in Helen , Ga. : " It 's been a long dry spell for us , and we feel a little like farmers when they get that first whiff of needed rain . " <P> More than regional pride lies behind the enthusiasm . Most Southerners think Carter will find the right approach to unemployment and inflation , the two problems that head most lists of priorities . They also share his views on cutting Government waste and overhauling the tax system . Said Atlanta Artist Charles Mitchell , who carved the 5-ft. - wide mahogany presidential seal that will hang behind Carter as he watches the Inaugural parade : Carter 's hit on a lot of things that I 've been fussing about for years , and now he 's trying to do something . The commentators all say it 's not practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same spirit was in evidence when James B. Hunt Jr. , 39 , was sworn in as North Carolina 's new Governor at a celebration that said a good deal about the South today . There were vestiges of the Old South : the official organizers served nothing stronger than nonalcoholic Catawba grape juice , though they tolerated hip flasks of bourbon and Scotch . But there were also elements of the New South : many of the majorettes in the inaugural parade were black , and at the ball , after some foot-stomping folk dances by the Grandfather Mountain Cloggers , the North Carolina Dance Theater performed an excerpt from The Nutcracker . Said Hunt : ' ' We have to involve people , and we simply must be more creative in asking them to get involved . "
