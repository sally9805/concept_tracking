Long before oil started to become as costly as gin , before the quest for " alternate energy sources " became the moral equivalent of war and before he started writing this week 's cover story on " The Cooling of America , " TIME Contributor Jack Skow bought his first woodburning stove . A city boy who now lives in rural New London , N.H. ( pop . 2,943 ) , Skow offers a modest explanation for his extraordinary foresight . " I was one of the first in town to get a wood stove , in 1973 , because I went broke from electric heating bills . " Since then , Skow has spent much of his autumn harvesting hardwood on his property , hauling it home in his temperamental pickup truck and burning it efficiently in his five-count ' em , five-woodburning stoves . The trend he pioneered in New London and discusses in this week 's story has become a way of life for Skew 's neighbors . Says he : " You get parties up here where home are not talking about adultery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood stoves . Of course , we all tell incredible lies about how long our model will hold a fire . " <P> The gospel of wood power has yet to reach suburban Weston , Conn. , 170 miles closer to the equator . But one resident , TIME Associate Editor Christopher Byron , is an ardent stoveowning votary . Byron , whose guide to new heat-saving gadgets accompanies Skew 's story , has two wood stoves in his home . He adds : " I have fitted the house with every form of insulation and heat-saving device short of an IBM 370 to run the furnace . " Among them : storm windows , weather stripping , a new DOUG BRUCE fuel-efficient oil furnace and a clock-timer thermostat that shuts off the furnace at night . " The temperature drops by only 15 with the heat off , " says Byron , " and then we use electric blankets-one of the greatest inventions of modern man . " <P> Reporter-Researcher Sara Medina , who helped report the cover story , and Nancy Griffin , who wrote the section on cold-weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City apartments . " Undershirts are the answer , " advises Griffin . Medina has found a radical solution to the high cost of fuel . Says she : " We do n't use the stuff . " For the past six winters , Medina and her husband have made do with the 60 to 65 provided by a fireplace , southern exposed windows , weather stripping and heat from surrounding apartments . Says she : " We discovered the layered look in clothing long before it was in fashion , but we 're healthy , our plants seem to flourish and our cats grow pelts like minks. "
