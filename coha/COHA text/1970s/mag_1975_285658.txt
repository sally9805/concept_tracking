She once inquired in the vernacular whether guards conducting a search had looked up the rectum of a lawyer whom she had just jailed for contempt . On another occasion off the bench , she threatened to give a traffic policeman " a vasectomy with a .38 . " To round out her reputation , she sometimes heard cases with her pet Chihuahua in her lap , and for a while had a toy canary that punctuated lawyers ' arguments with mechanical peeps . Few attorneys dared to pipe back publicly . So for twelve years Judge Cannon presided as a choice gossip topic in the L.A. bar . <P> But her increasing propensity to jail and dismiss defense attorneys for minor or nonexistent infractions led finally to an effort to spike Cannon .
