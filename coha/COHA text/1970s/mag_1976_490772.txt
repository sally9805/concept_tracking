THE NEW TOM THE TALK OF THE TOVN Notes and Comment AFRIEND writes : At a Washington party the other night , a party jam-packed with beautiful men and interesting women , I learned that the I.R.S. is planning to issue , more or less immediately , revised Form 101-0s for 1976 . The new form will allow the conscientious taxpayer to check off one-dollar contributions to ( 1 ) the American election campaign , ( 2 ) the Italian election campaign , ( 3 ) the Angolan regimental band of his choice , and ( 4 ) the Latin-American political entity he most wishes destabilized in Fiscal Year 1977 . And I thought , What of Andorra ? What are we doing for poor little Andorra ( pop . 23,004 ) ? There is a Red housepainters ' local there that surely we can arrange to have the bristles drop out of the brushes of . Mr Colby is asleep . THE tinsel and the holly are gone , the last carol has died on the air , but there 's something about Christmas that lingers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Houston , Texas . Fred L. Xerxes is a true Texan , with a big heart , and every Christmas for years he has taken out four subscriptions to this magazine : one for himself and Mrs. Fred L. Xerxes , and three as gifts for faraway friends , two of them residents of Mexico City . But in the course of this year the Xerxes household fell apart : Mr. Xerxes moved to another house in the same town , while Mrs. Xerxes , now calling herself Louisa M. Xerxes , continued to get the magazine at their old address . So when The New Yorker sent Mr. Xerxes reminder that it was time to renew his four subscriptions , that , too , was delivered to the home of Louisa M. , who handed it over to her former spouse  --  not , we gather , without some crisp , unseasonal remarks . Somewhat shaken but still oozing good will , Mr. Xerxes made a couple of changes on the renewal-order Form and dashed off a letter of explanation to our subscription department , along with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything ) one for the former Mrs. Fred L. Xerxes  --  in the amount of fifty-four dollars : exactly four dollars ( the postal surcharge for mailing two subscriptions to Mexico ) short of what he owed . How what happened next did happen was beyond Mr. Xerxes . Almost faster than you can say " United States Postal Service , " Louisa M. Xerxes was hit with a statement , this time addressed to her , crediting her with all four subscriptions and billing her for the four dollars that Mr. Xerxes had failed to remit . And this time the lady exercised even less restraint in unburdening her feelings to Mr. Xerxes , who could n't wait to acquaint us with the whole messy story . " Your computer continues to pour salt in old wounds , " he wrote , in a generous , inky scrawl . What had it done ? Rather , what had Mr. Xerxes done ? When he was presented with that renewal-order form at Christmas , his own name and old address , as donor , headed the list of recipients ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross out " Fred L. " and write in " Louisa . M. " above it , letting the rest of the address stand . He had gone ahead and changed the second name on the list to " Mrs. Fred L. Xerxes , " and had given that subscriber a new address . For , as he arrestingly put it , " I married one of my gift subscriptions , after divorcing Louisa M. Xerxes . " Only his instruction , in the separate letter , to " reverse the top two names " had gone unheeded . And so the first Mrs. Xerxes was riot only being credited with the gift to her successor ( former subscriber Mrs. Violet Angstrom ) of fifty-two weeks of The New Yorker but dunned for the balance due . " If you were present at the tongue-lashing I received last Saturday , you would have a deeper sensitivity to my problem , " Mr. Xerxes concluded . " Computers have no souls , you know . " Well , Mr. Xerxes , we 're not sure we want a deeper sensitivity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough by the emotions we 've unintentionally stirred up down there in Texas : far too complex and subtle to he sorted out on a computer card , and inviting , rather , the pen of the ironist  --  a Meredith rather than a Memorihank . But who has ever claimed that computers have souls Consider what really led to the mixup . Was it the computer that caused the smooth pattern of all those lives to he so profoundly altered in a brief fifty-two weeks ? To look a little closer , was it not the Texan 's own largesse d'esprit that led to those bitter things Louisa M. said to him last Saturday ? The problem , if one thinks about it a minute , is not that computers have no souls but that human beings do have souls  --  a tangle of crossed wires and contrary impulses . Man stumbles onward with his foot in a bucket . ? Fast WE spent the Saturday between Christmas and New Year 's in Atlanta , Georgia , and that afternoon we stopped by the West Hunter Street Baptist Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End . The pastor of the church is Dr. Ralph David Abernathy , and during the week between the holidays he turned over the gymnasium that is part of his church-and-school complex to an event known as the Dick Gregory Food Fast . Gregory , the comedian and civil-rights activist , has been speaking and writing lately about the worldwide shortage of food , and a few weeks ago he sent out ? publicity asking people to join him in a seven-day fast to bring attention to what he considers a dangerously critical situation . We found that the gymnasium was modern and large  --  it had six basketball hoops  --  and that it was painted in shades of orange and sea green . On the polished wooden floor were sleeping bags , knapsacks , suitcases , boots , sneakers , and other paraphernalia . Not far From the entrance were about a dozen cases of bottled distilled water . There was not much Lancing , but the people who were lounging or walking about appeared cheerful . In an adjacent office , Dick Gregory was talking on a telephone while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a lavender-and-white caftan , long 1113-derwear , and sneakers . When he had finished his call , he came over and greeted us with a smile . He was thinner than he had been the last time we saw him , and his close-cropped beard was more grizzled , but his eyes looked as confident and amused as they had when he was tossing off laugh lines at the Village Gate a few years back . He told us that a hundred and twenty people , about half of them black and most of them quite young , were taking part in the fast . " We would have had even more if we had sent out our mailings a little earlier , " he said . " All our flyers got caught in the Christmas rush . But everything 's cool . It 's cool because people are here from Illinois , California , Arkansas , Connecticut , Washington , D.C. ? I ca n't remember all the places . What this is all about is we 're bringing attention to the food shortage in America and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this  --  if you consider it as a world problem , the food shortage is a matter of scarcity . But in this country the food shortage is a matter of price . People just ca n't afford to eat anymore  --  understand what I mean ? Old people are shoplifting from supermarkets . Poor people are eating dog food . They are . You just have to look around all those housing developments where no pets are allowed , and see all the empty dog-food cans . And the situation will soon be worse than it was during the nineteen-thirties . Then , at least , if you could get hold of a dime you could buy your family some substantial food . We 're proposing several solutions . We 'd like to see a new Cabinet post  --  Secretary of Food and Nutrition . We 'd like to see a new kind of food stamp  --  one that would guarantee staples like rice , beans , and corn at ten cents a pound . We have to make the situation here at home our first priority , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food riots in 1976 ? and what kind of Bicentennial will that he ? " Gregory told us that he himself had been fasting since Thanksgiving , and that in the spring he plans to run from Los Angeles to New York , averaging forty miles a day and subsisting mainly on fruit juices and kelp , in order to bring further attention to the food shortage . He said that many people had phoned or sent telegrams supporting his efforts , among them Cesar Chavez , Barbra Streisand , Muhammad Ali , Eugene McCarthy , John Lennon , and Stevie Wonder . He added that Coretta King and the Reverend Martin Luther King , Sr. , were expected to drop in during the fast , as was , of course , Dr. Abernathy himself . He went off to take another phone call , and we spoke with some of the participants in the fast . A fellow called Ron Marcus told us that he was studying for a degree in social work at Arizona State University , near Phoenix , and that he considered this event an important form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us that she works as a postal clerk in Chicago and that she viewed the fast primarily as a matter of consciousness-raising . In addition to fasting , she said , they would be reading hooks they had brought along , playing guitars , and holding seminars . Late in the day , the participants went up to a balcony overlooking the gym and listened to Dr. Alvenia M. Fulton , a naturopath , who has acted as Gregory 's consultant during previous fasts , as she gave advice about Fasting . The fast seemed to he very well organized , but we ca n't vouch for the dependability of the medical precautions . Only distilled water was drunk ; a small amount of honey and lemon was taken with each gallon of water ; short walks were encouraged , but no one was to lift anything heavy . After a while , Gregory came upstairs and spoke to the group . " What 's making this happen is you , " he said . " That gym down there is the battlefield . That 's where you all sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be happening . Without you , we could n't get our message across . Without you , there would be no fast . Charlie Mingus , the bassist , told me that he was fasting one time with some people in New York and that he and the others got so hungry they decided to go out and get some of the Colonel 's fried chicken . They were n't going to eat it , you understand . They were just going to sort of look at it . Well , do n't JANUARY 19 , 19 7 6 you try that , because on the third night Mingus started eating the chicken . " Everyone laughed , and Gregory said , " Sleep well , and tomorrow morning we 're going to get you all up early . It wo n't be difficult , though , because one kind lady has volunteered to wake you up by playing the flute . " Wales Ho MIDSUMMER reading for the short , dark days . A friend writes : My girl friend Elaine has been cleaning up my office  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncashed paycheck , a BB pistol that does n't work , a blue bathing suit , a top hat , a fez , a 1971 Manhattan Yellow Pages , a bottle of Polish vodka , thirty-one dollars extra I promised to refund to a group of people for a Columbus Day bus ride to Massachusetts I organized , and an account of my amazing two days in the town of Penrhyndeudraeth , in North Wales , in July . I was motoring up from Glastonbury , which was overrun with real hippies  --  come on , hitch your chair a little closer to the fire and we 'll cast our minds back  --  just after throwing a Fourth of July party in London that featured a huge bowl of chili and a lot of whiskey and South African dance records . The English are n't used to juxtapositions like that . I mean , they enjoyed themselves , but they could n't understand why . It puzzled them . They kept coming up and asking , " Did you put cannabis in that chili ? " And I was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Henry from New York at the wheel and humming " Men of Harlech " it was a gorgeous day  --  to find ( 1 ) the place where they made " The Prisoner , " a super TV series that pitted Patrick McGoohan against the most confusing conspiracy in history , and ( 2 ) the only narrow-gauge railroad in the world that serves draft beer . In the series , which was shown on CBS in I968 and 1969 , McGoohan is trapped in a bright-colored seaside village that seems to have been assembled from every startling bit of architecture ever developed in a warm climate . The village has towers and spires and domes and colonnades and cottages and palm trees and a beach and enough nooks and crannies to fill a city , and it might be in Italy and it might be in Greece , it might be in Surinam  --  well , the point is where the hell is it Because you ca n't quite place it . Patrick McGoohan ca n't escape from the village , because he is hounded by giant balloons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's there or who 's running the place . He keeps asking people in the village , " Are you No . ? " But everyone 's evasive . " I 'm No. 7 . " " I 'm No. 2 . " The TV show did n't last  --  it went off the air in New York City after sixteen episodes . I think it puzzled people , and maybe it scared them a little . But I thought it was funny , because it seemed completely hum.m in its bizarre way , and the village continued to hop around in my mind , owing to the question of where the hell ? Now , it was in London , at the Fourth of July party , that Henry and I learned the truth about the village in " The Prisoner . " It 's up in North Wales , on Cardigan Bay , on a thickly wooded peninsula near Harlech Castle and many abandoned slate quarries , and almost in the shadow of a great hunk of wild Celtic mountain called the Snowdonia Massif , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clough Williams-Ellis , who has been building it for almost fifty years . We had heard about the little railway previously , and threw it in for good measure . Neither Henry nor I had ever been to Celtic Wales before , and did n't know what to expect , and certainly no one could expect Penrhyndeudraeth or the Festiniog Railway . But even aside from them we discovered that Wales is not the same place as England . As soon as you drive over the line from Shropshire , you get the feeling : all bets are off . In England , the fields and the copses and the villages are all just so . The country is settled . The impression in England is : people moved in here several thousand years ago , and they drew up some rules , and they 're still here , and they 've still got ' em , and that 's that . But ' Wales is unpredictable . We see wild crags , lambs almost hidden by ferns , slate roofs , pieces of slate stuck in the ground vertically to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mountains and warm sun down below . Just before sunset , our car is parked in a slot marked " RESIDENTS ONT V " at Sir Clough 's village , and Henry and I have slipped behind a couple of rhododendron bushes to put ties on for dinner in the main dining room . The name of the village is Portmeirionofficially , the Hotel Portmeirion  --  and a resident is anyone who has hooked a room overnight . The setting sun is glinting off the spire of a dome and a campanile . Yellow , white , blue , and red cottages  --  just like on TV  --  are nestled around a little beach . Low tide . It 's very still , and the only person we can see is a guy spinning around out on the water in a blueand-yellow rubber kayak called Octopus IV . There are some city pigeons on the salt flats , a couple of gulls are crying , the leaves of a palm tree are just barely shimmering next to a Union Jack and a flag of the Principality of Wales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more so . And much cuter , too . Two very inaccurate little cannons are trained on the bay . There 's a statue of Atlas over there inscribed " TO THE SUMMER OF 1959 IN HONOUR OF ITS SPLENDOUR . " Another plaque says , " 1971 HIGHLY COMMENDED . " Somewhere , water is plashing . Four black ducks fly over- head in formation . And there 's a tree that was planted on Sir Clough 's eightieth birthday . It 's doing very well . And there 's half of a coracle , ivy-covered . Also a half-moon in the sky . A single moo from somewhere . I feel just a little giddy . Noel Coward songs ( oh , yes , did you know that he stayed here for a week and wrote all of " Blithe Spirit " in that time ? ) ? Noel Coward songs , I say , pulse through my mind : " In a bar on the Piccola Marina " and " Quite for no reason I 'm here for the season , and high as a kite . Living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he right . " Perhaps a little dinner will calm me down . The dining room is part of a large country house  --  the only building on the property when Sir Clough moved in and started tinkering fifty years ago . Several older English couples are holding conversations barely above a whisper . " I did my training in oil at .. . " " We 've collected old silver all our lives . " " I had a horrid experience in London . " The waiter brings melon , and , when he takes it away again , says , " Thank you , sir . " Henry whispers , " Is that a Buddha I see before me ? " " Yes . " Our mood does not subside . In fact , it may be catching . A lady at the next table gets the silent giggles and can not finish her giitraii . Outside , a sign says , " TO DELVEDERE , SEA LAWN AND EROTTO . " We drive to the nearby official town of Penrhyndeudraeth for a breath . All low gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " ALCATRAZ UNISEX ISOUTIQUE . " Then back to our Portmeirion cottage , up a winding stair . THE next day , after a spot of brekker , we have a word with Michael Trevor Williams , hotel manager for twenty-three years . The hotel is spotlessly and efficiently maintained . He says that Sir Clough has been persuaded to slow down on new construction , lest the place get out of control ; that " The Prisoner " was shot at Portmeirion one September , the film crew arriving unexpectedly with about a hundred extras , thus necessitating the revival of several elderly resident retired colonels with brandy ; that the series was never shown on Welsh TV ; that Portmeirinn was never consciously intended to be like anything , but just gay and amusing ; that the hotel can accommodate about a hundred ; that among its guests have been Richard Hughes , Bertrand Russell , a number of diplomats , Alastair Sim ( who comes in August ) , Sir Alec Guinness , Maggie Smith , and some Americans ( who expect frightful efficiency ) ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers just over a hundred . " IAThat else can I tell you about this dotty place ? It becomes a way of life . Oh , will you excuse me a minute ? There 's the manager of the maintenance staff , and he 's very elusive . We 're expecting a visit from the fire officer tomorrow . Fire precautions are so fierce . We spent ten thousand pounds on the main building last year . " Mr. Williams , when he returns , says he thinks Sir Clough will be around later in the day . SO we drive to the seaside village of Portmadoc for a ride on the Festiniog Railway , a narrow-gauge railway with two Fairlie double-ended locomotives , built on the premises in 1879 and 1886 . The Fairfie is like a Pushmi-pullyu , Two stacks , two boilers , and the driver stands in the middle . The Festiniog 's Fairlies are as sound as bells . Your friend Ernest Frimbo , the world 's greatest railroad huff  --  who is known over here , I have . discovered , as the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line . The Festiniog was built to haul slate , and the tracks run from the seaside quite quickly into mountains . Geraniums m the station window boxes . Lace curtains on the stationmaster 's windows . Bright sunshine . For sale in the station : Festiniog pillowcases and " Sammy the Shunter , " by Eileen Gibb , about a switch engine . ( " ' What 's the matter , Sammy , ' asked Mr. Buffin , his driver . ' You 're making a queer kind of noise this morning . ' ' There 's a nasty pain in my boiler , ' whispered Sammy in a trembly voice . ' Oh dear , I do feel ill ! My wheels are shaking . ' " ) " I remember a narrow-gauge line at Badami , in western India , " says Henry . " Very slow , and broiling in the carriages . You could walk along beside the train to get a little air . Monkeys in the trees all along the way . They did n't come in the train , though . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first class . I was in third . " JANUARY 1 9 I I9 7 A third-class ticket on the Festiniog is ? 1 .1 0 . First class is ? 1 .30 . That 's for a nineteen-mile-round-trip ticket from Portmadoc to Dduallt and back , at a top speed of about twenty miles an hour . The Festiniog Railway has a **31;5128;TOOLONG gauge ; standard railroad tracks are four feet eight and a half inches apart , The Festiniog carries four hundred thou-sand passengers a year , but it is sus-tained in large part by volunteer labor . Gangs of schoolboys , accompanied by a master , do maintenance work on the right of way , and other vol-unteers rebuild carriages , fire up the engines , sell " Sammy the Shunter " hooks , make bulletin boards for the sta-tions , and in general do whatever has to be done to augment the small per-manent paid staff . The Festiniog is advertised as " The Most Wonderful Railway in the Kingdom . " The peak month is August , with thirteen trains a day between Portmadoc and Dduallt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there are a few holiday specials at Christmastime . A first-class ticket en-titles you to a seat in an observation car with large rear windows and access to the draft beer , so Henry and I decided to go first . The train had ten pony-size coaches and a puffing butter-ball of an engine , named Blanche and painted black and green with red trim and bright , shiny brass . Across a cause-way and into the green countryside . We settled down in plump armchairs in the observation car and ordered pints of draft beer . Since the entire right-of-way occupies only a few feet , we had plenty of countryside to take impres-sions from . Swans and cows on a salt flat . A slate farmhouse with a black-and-white dog in front of its red door . Two little lambs quite unstartled and almost hidden by ferns a few feet from the train . Harlech Castle a small gray squiggle on the horizon . A slow climb through pines , scrub oaks , and rhodo-dendrons , past pros-pects and vales , to a high place where we ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a floating , soaring hawk flying over a valley a thou-sand feet below . Final-ly , at Dduallt halt , a chance to get out and stretch before a more rapid , buckety-buckety descent to Portmadoc . The engine driver deTHE NEW YORKER layed the return journey until the guard came running back to the train with a cup of tea . SIR CLOUGH WILLIAMS-ELLIS , it turned out , is as remarkable as his buildings , an uncommon man even for a kingdom where the general run of subjects are uniquely unique , to say the least . Sir Clough was toasting himself before a fire when we got back to Portmeirion . He is six feet two inches tall and , at ninety-two , is in excellent health . He is as bright as a button , friendly , a charmer , and something of a dandy . He had on a blue suit , a canary-yellow waistcoat , a blue-and-white polka-dot cravat , a blue silk display handkerchief , and brown suede shoes . " Well , " he said , rising to his full height . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good . My uncle was chairman of the line for many years . He presented the chairmen of the Great Western Railway and the London &; North Western Railway , two of the great trunk lines of Britain , with silver medals and free first-class passes on the Festiniog . They could do no more than respond with free gold passes on the G.W.R. and the L. &; N.W. And my uncle , of course , then went whizzing about all over England for the rest of his life , and lived to be ninety-two . " Sir Clough , who wrote a book in 1928 warning about the coming of megalopolis , helped develop the idea of the green belt around cities and , after the Second World War , was the first chairman of the first New Town in Britain , Stevenage . He describes himself as " rather a curiosity . " " I never had any architectural training , except three months ' work in the office of Sir Edwin Lutyens , the designer of New Delhi , a man whose work is now completely out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Very dangerous , ' he would say , ' all this talk . It is bringing the ears so far forward they will act as blinkers to the eyes . ' I 'm a rogue architect . I was very nervous when Frank Lloyd Wright came to visit here , but he never had any formal architectural training , either , and he took it like a lamb , Indeed , he conducted me around . Wonderful old prima donna , was n't he ? I first met him in 1937 , when we were both on a train going to Moscow for a town-planning conference . There was a great scene at the Polish border when he refused to have his baggage examined . The authorities were about to send him home , but I walked him up and down and said , ' Oh , come off it , ' and eventually he did . What I dislike about the work of some of my colleagues today is that they seem to be building for machines , and not for soft little animals such as you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end to be a quite fantastic economic success . Portmeirion is supposed to speak for itself , but I may say it has all worked out very much as I 'd first hoped and imagined . You 've seen the campanile ? It has an old brewery clock in its turret . It was one of the first things I built here , way back in 1928 . It 's quite useless , and it set a standard for everything I 've tried to do here . Portmeirion is not only for my own enjoyment , it 's also an outdoor museum of live architectural objects . I loathe committees unless I 'm the chairman , so for many years when I was practicing architecture in London I spent most of my time on committees scribbling plans for Portmeirion . Have you been in the dome ? Or the town hall ? " " No , " we said . " Well , I 'm afraid you 'll have to do both . Come on . " Sir Clough strode off and began bouncing up and down a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he called remarks over his shoulder . " This urn looks a little crooked . There , that 's better . It 's plywood . Do you like that plaque ? I happened to have a spare one , so I put it in that pediment . There 's the dome , People say , ' What 's it for ? ' I do n't know . I usually tell them that , having a campanile , I was suddenly aware of an acute dome deficiency , which had to be corrected immediately . And here 's the town hall . " The town hall has , underneath a cupola made from an old copper boiler , a unique seventeenth-century barrel-vaulted ceiling painted with scenes from the life of Hercules , which Sir Clough long ago rescued by dashing to a pre-demolition auction in Flintshire . " When the lot was announced , " he said as we stood under the glowing ceiling , " there was dead silence . ' No bids " asked the auctioneer . ' Yes , ' I said . ' Ten pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again dead silence . ' Ali right , ' I said . ' Thirteen pounds . ' Now we 'll see the car park . I 'm very proud of that . It 's the only car park I 've ever seen that really is a park . " On the way to the car park , we passed a plaque inscribed with one of Sir Clough 's mottoes : " CHERISH THE PAST , ADORN THE PRESENT , CONSTRUCT FOR THE FUTURE . " It was still a hot , hazy , bright-blue summer 's day in Wales .
