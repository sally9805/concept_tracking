txt The second day of battle between invading Chinese troops and Vietnamese defenders was apparently confined to reinforcement of the Chinese striking force and deployment of five to seven divisions of the Vietnamese Army in an arc protecting approaches to Hanoi from the north , east and south . Although the fighting appeared to be on a reduced scale , an official representative of China emphasized in an interview that the offensive " will continue . " American and European experts on the Vietnam and China area , studying the results of the fighting , said that the Chinese offensive had apparently caught Vietnam 's main forces by surprise . The experts said the Chinese forces , despite some losses in Cao Bang Province , had pushed through resistance offered by frontier guards , militia units and other irregular troops . Coordinated With Guerrillas The analysts said the Chinese offensive was coordinated with an increase in guerrilla activity against Vietnamese invaders in Cambodia . This was probably intended to pin down the regular Vietnamese units there . Hanoi admitted that its forces were fighting on five fronts yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Route 3 , leading from Kampot to Phnom Penh , the capital . In the first hours of the fighting , the Chinese outnumbered the Vietnamese forces at least 2 to 1 , according to intelligence analysts . The invaders were successsful in the opening attack , but they did not come into contact with Vietnamese Army regular units . Three to five divisons of this army , considered the best fighting force in Southeast Asia , are preparing the defense of Hanoi in a rough crescent starting at Yeh Bar on the Red River north of the capital to Quang Yen on the coast . The Vietnamese command problem has not changed in the last 24 hours . The generals do not know which avenue of attack the Chinese will follow if they open // an assault against Hanoi . Nor do they know whether the Chinese intend to continue the offensive . At the end of the first day 's fighting . the Chinese had developed two threatening thrusts toward the capital . One , through Lao Cai northwest of Hanoi , apparently came to within 140 miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Son area , is reported to have reached a point a bit less than 100 miles from Hanoi . The presence of strong Chinese forces ? infantry operating in close coordination with tanks ? on both these fronts poses a clear threat to the Vietnamese capital . Chinese gave a strong impression , however , that these were not the only drives in the direction of Hanoi nor , perhaps , the most threatening . Reports that the Chinese , having dealt what they regard as punishment to Vietnam , are preparing to withdraw , are balanced by reports from China of strong forces of infantry , artillery and tanks moving south to an assembly area north of the Vietnamese frontier . The pause in Chinese operations may be explained , military sources said , by the usual requirement for consolidation and reorganization after a successful initial advance . The Chinese have imposed a two-front war on Vietnam , but they are fighting with one eye on to the north on their border with the Soviet Union . Sources at North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Belgium emphasized in telephone interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along that frontier would halt China 's offensive in Vietnam . There have been no such reports . The only Russian action , reported from Tokyo , was the flight of two TU-97D reconnaissance aircraft southward above the Tsushima Strait toward Vietnam . The Bears , as they are known in NATO , are 1 elieved to have flown from Soviet airfields in the Maritime Province . Their mission was probably to survey the battle area , which for most of the day was under heavy clouds . The Chinese had relatively few serious problems in the first two days of fighting . Their initial drive was preceded not by intensive bombing , which would have been the case if NATO or Warsaw Pact forces had been involved , but rather by a prolonged and heavy artillery barrage from artillery ranging from 122-millimeter to 155 millimeter , and 120-millimeter and 160-millimeter mortars . The Chinese are also reported to have used some 122-millimeter self-propelled guns in the initial assault . The heavy artillery preparation , at the cost of the element of surprise , may have been necessary , military sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China 's tanks . These are Soviet-built ** first produced during World War II , and Chineseproduced medium tanks . These tanks would be vulnerable to antitank weapons that the Soviet Union has supplied to Vietnam . A true test of the two battling forces will develop if the Chinese decide to carry out a full attack on Hanoi , rather than pull back across the frontier proclaiming a victory as they withdraw . The Vietnamese forces around the city , estimated at about 50,000 men at the most , would have the advantage of entrenched positions and more modem antitank and antiaircraft systems . These include Soviet surface-to-air missiles . The expectation among experts on the Vietnam area was that if such an attack developed , the Vietnamese would have to concentrate the most effective of their air interceptors to defend the city . If the Chinese continue what they regard as a punitive operation , in reprisal for Vietnam 's invasion of Cambodia , the Western experts predict that the " punishment " will not be exclusively one sided once the Chinese come up against regular Vietnamese formations defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
