Winning the national basketball championship this year means more than just a title , a trophy and the right to chant " We 're No. 1 ! " It is the opportunity to start a new dynasty . With former U.C.L.A. Coach John Wooden in retirement and his once-invincible Bruins now playing like mortals , a kingdom is up for grabs . <P> In the N.C.A.A. tournament that began last weekend , there is an abundance of possibilities besides fifth-ranked U.C.L.A. Marquette , in Wisconsin , and Alabama both look strong , and late-blooming Virginia knocked off three of the top teams in the country en route to its upset triumph in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament earlier this month . The East has undefeated Rutgers entered in the lists . But no team seems readier for the March 29 finals than the Hoosiers of Indiana , ranked No. 1 in the nation , undefeated in 56 consecutive regular season games and , above all , coached by Bobby Knight . <P> In a sport full of men who fiercely want to win , Knight , 35 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else 's . When his team is ahead by 30 points and the reserves are in , Knight exhorts at them as if the score were tied in overtime . During a recently televised game against Michigan , he became so disturbed by some bad passes his guard Jim Wisman made that he grabbed Wisman by his jersey and hauled him off the court . If a referee 's call goes against Indiana , Knight sometimes succumbs to his hot temper and starts kicking the nearest chair . Even when he goes fishing , the Scoreboard stays lit . If he casts ten times and catches three fish , he will say good naturedly that the fish won , 7-3 . <P> Sixth Man . On the court , his team reflects his intensity , sometimes to a fault . Early this season Knight realized his players were so worried about making mistakes that they were no longer performing well ; he offered some praise , and the Hoosiers ' playing quickly improved . But discipline-lots of it-is the essence of Knight 's coaching style . " I tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , there will be others above you . Get used to it now . " <P> Some followers of the sport compare this year 's Hoosier team to the greatest college squads of the past , including the 1960 Ohio State national championship team that Knight played on as a sophomore ( he was the sixth man ) with Teammates Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek . Indiana Forward Scott May ( 6 ft. 7 in. ) and Center Kent Benson ( 6 ft. 11 in. ) are both All-America ; Forward Tom Abernethy ( 6 ft. 7 in. ) and Guard Bobby Wilkerson ( 6 ft. 7 in. ) are both outstanding on defense ; and when powerful Guard Quinn Buckner ( 6 ft. 3 in. ) runs onto the home court the Indiana band strikes up The Mighty Quinn .
