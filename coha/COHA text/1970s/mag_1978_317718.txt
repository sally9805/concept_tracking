But goes into frenzied marathon sessions in an attempt to avoid a Carter veto <P> Few lines won Jimmy Carter more cheers in his election campaign than his charge that the nation 's tax system is a " disgrace . " As President , he pledged to make the tax code " simple , fair , equitable and progressive " and to " substantially reduce " the burden on the taxpayer . But Carter discovered that Congress had its own idea of just what kind of tax program the nation needs . <P> At the start of this week , the House and Senate produced a bill that would slash $18.7 billion from the tax rolls . This was the centerpiece of one of the most chaotic finales to a congressional session in memory . As Senators and Representatives fought both fatigue and filibuster , they hurriedly voted on scores of measures in a rush to get home in time to campaign for reelection . Said Connecticut Democrat Abraham Ribicoff , a 16-year veteran of the Senate : " I do n't recall an end of session worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totals some $1.3 billion more in cuts than Carter had requested in August . The bill , moreover , contains few of the reforms that the President had originally proposed last December . Missing , for example , are cuts in deductions allowed for medical costs and for business entertainment , such as club dues , first-class travel and the much maligned three-martini lunch . Tuned finely to the antitax and more conservative mood of the electorate , Congress was mainly interested in axing federal levies and encouraging investment . Although the congressional bill falls short of the Administration 's original goals , it seemed certain that Carter would sign it . <P> If the President okays the bill , taxpayers will be pleasantly surprised when they begin filling out their 1979 returns . Individuals will receive about $15 billion in cuts ( including $2.1 billion in capital gains ) , with corporations getting only $3.6 billion . In past years , the business tax cut has amounted to about 50% of that received by individuals ; this year , it is 25% . Under the reduction proposed by Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find its income taxes reduced by $97 , although , under a law passed last year , it will be paying $42 more in annual Social Security taxes beginning Jan. 1 . A family earning $25,000 will save $249 on federal income taxes , but its added Social Security burden will be $439 . <P> The bill sent to the Oval Office is the product of a joint House-Senate committee that began meeting late last week in the Ways and Means Committee 's ornate , high-ceilinged conference room in the House 's Longworth Office Building . The task of these ten Representatives and 14 Senators was to reconcile the vastly differing tax bills that each chamber had passed . While the Representatives ' version , approved last month , would have saved taxpayers $16.3 billion , the Senate expanded the cut to $29.3 billion .
