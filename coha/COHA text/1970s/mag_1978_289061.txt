Battlestar Galactica seems strangely familiar <P> What much-ballyhooed show has the following elements : 1 ) a wise old man whose mission is to save the human race ; 2 ) an unusually nasty villain who wants to destroy the human race ; 3 ) two handsome young bucks who trade good-humored gibes ; 4 ) the most huggable little robot in the universe ; 5 ) a bizarre barroom populated by inhuman creatures on a desert planet ; 6 ) lots of gray spaceships whishing around against a brilliant blue background ? <P> The answer , as anyone knows who has been watching TV promotion spots lately , is ABC 's new series Battlestar Galactica , perhaps the most blatant rip-off ever to appear on the small screen . The show ripped off , naturally , is Star Wars , which Galactica copies in nearly everything but wit and talent . As a result , even before the show premieres this Sunday , it has been caught up in legal controversy . <P> The plot differs from Star Wars only in detail : by some devilish mischief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 planets harboring the human race . Led by a human renegade called Count Baltar , a first cousin to Darth Vader , the robots take off in hot pursuit of the survivors of the dozen planets , who are manning a ragtag fleet hovering around the " battlestar " Galactica . The humans are desperately searching for the 13th planet , a lost , legendary human colony called Earth . Lorne Greene is the wise old man in charge , and Dirk Benedict and Richard Hatch play Han Solo and Luke Skywalker . . . oops , Lieut . Starbuck and Captain Apollo . Galactica 's version of Artoo Detoo is a robot dog , a " daggit , " named Muffit . Unfortunately , the duplicator at Universal Studios , which is producing the show , seems to have broken down before it could re-create the inimitable Threepio or Star Wars ' Wookie , the most famous Teddy bear since Winnie-the-Pooh . <P> Universal has spent more money on Galactica , or Star Wars 1 , as it might be called , than anyone has ever spent on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star Wars itself . Moreover , Tektronix , Inc. , a computer firm , has contributed a real computerized control room , and John Dykstra , 31 , who created the wizardry special effects for Star Wars , was commissioned to work the same magic for Galactica . <P> Star Wars fans will recognize his touch in some fierce space battle scenes and seemingly three-dimensional images of stars and planets . Similar tricks were also used to move the various robots . Whereas Artoo Detoo was powered by a midget , Galactica 's Muffit hides a chimpanzee , which Dykstra figured could more easily reproduce the unpredictable , jumpy actions of another animal , or robot animal . The formidable Lucifer , Count Baltar 's aptly named robot assistant , however , does house a man . Since Actor Bobby Porter is only 4 ft. 11 in. , the towering Lucifer has 18 unoccupied inches on top for a plastic head and enough flashing lights to start his own discothque.
