Last year an attorney named Alger Hiss was quietly readmitted to the bar . He is seventy years old , but this fact is signifi  --  cant only to those who can remember that in 1948 his name was the focus of the most sensational spy story of the era . It had all of the elements of a fiction thriller written by an author possessed of one mad literary flaw : his plot revolved upon a preposterous device , a secret film hidden in a pumpkin . On this hung the vindication or destruction of the character of a man in high government service . Yet this low comedy relief was the stuff of true life tragedy , involving a confront a  --  tion of the two greatest nations on earth . The story is not retold here with a view to any misguided nostalgia concerning this somewhat sordid case . What makes it timely and meaningful today is that our country is under severe stress in matters of security and espionage , and that is precisely what the Pumpkin Papers trial was all about . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiss is now practicing law in the courts of the same nation which convicted him for per  --  jury in a case specifically intended to prove espionage on his part as a com  --  munist agent . To those of us old enough to remember the time , the story begins with a clouding of what the precise relationship had be  --  come between two staunch allies of World War II , Russia and the United States . Young and questioning people , liberal and creative folk , especially , were unsettled over the war , which like all wars had cost so much and seemingly solved so little . The basic truths of right and wrong were elusive . It was an era of restlessness and search . Ideologies and counterideologies were freely exchanged at parties . Under  --  ground the hard and brutal espionage machines had long been at their silent work . Some men of goodwill were trou  --  bled and aimless : there were other men who knew precisely what their goals were . Still others , some in very high places , had good reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier . Two such men collided in a confront a  --  tion which shook the nation . Today it reads like a TV serial  --  a complex fabric woven by idiots . The plot involved our national safety . It also brought togetherinextricably the lives of two entirely dif  --  ferent American men , both of them tal  --  ented and gifted . Ultimately they came face to face in a court of law , with the eyes of the world on them , and the con  --  flicting stories they told were shocking , frightening , and yet pathetic . The name of one was Alger Hiss , once an official in the State Department , a member of President Franklin Roosevelt 's inner circle , the President 's confidant at the Yalta Conference , one of the chief architects of the United Nations charter and the Secretary General of the United Nations organizational conference . It would be difficult to find a more impeccable background than that of Hiss . He was a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and Harvard Law School , both with highest honors . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chosen as a young man to be secretary to the renowned Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes . Alger Hiss was urbane and flaw  --  less in dress . His bearing exuded sobriety , confidence , dedication and aplomb . Not a hair on his head was out of place . There was no ounce of flab on his body . One look was enough to assure anyone that Alger was the essence of the creme de la creme  --  the very best the elite eastern establishment could produce . Fortunate we were to have a young man of such quality to help guide the affairs of state . And to gild this pure white lily , Alger Hiss was an expert ( if amateur ) birdwatcher . He could talk with eloquence and enthusi  --  asm about the rare prothonotary warbler , a shy creature with exquisite gold and yellow markings which was a sometime habitue of the swamps of Virginia . No one who really likes birds can intend ill for his fellowman . The other man , Whittaker Chambers , was something else . He was fat and pudgy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been jealous or at least ecstatic about his back  --  ground . As a young disenchanted intellec  --  tual he had broken with society in the 1920 's . He had been expelled from college and lied to get back in . He had lived in hovels , consorted with prostitutes , gone for years dirty and unwashed without owning a suit . He had adopted at least a half dozen aliases . He had owned a fal  --  sified passport using the stolen name of a baby deceased at birth . He had been an editor of the Daily Worker . He had filled out scores of fraudulent government papers . In the 1920 's he had been a card-carrying communist . In the 1930 's he joined the communist underground , an arm of the Soviet intelligence network . In this role he scurried with secrets from gov  --  ernment functionaries in Washington to his contacts in New York . Then , said Chambers ( and we have no reason to doubt ) , he broke with the party , hid for a while and joined the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgave him his credentials ; within a scant nine years he was a senior editor with a salary of $30,000 ( more than that of a U.

A pesky question kept coming up , though ; was he telling the truth when he said he had stopped lying ? Chambers was also a clever man . One of the clev  --  erest things he did was to save some of the stolen gov  --  ernment papers he was sup  --  posed to deliver to New York . Some of them , it was proved beyond a doubt , were typed on a typewriter owned , or once owned , by the impeccable Alger Hiss . In 1948 the House Com  --  mittee on Un-American Activities found Whittaker Chambers and asked him to testify . He was n't hard to find . Chambers had been trying to tell his story for some time . He had repeat  --  edly approached the State Department about it . Chambers testified because he felt it was his duty . He offered a list of names of other Communist Party members who were part of this espionage ring . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chambers claimed that Hiss in the late 1930 's had smuggled documents out of the State Department and given them to Chambers . Hiss emphatically denied this and said he had never known a man named Whit  --  taker Chambers . Hiss was eventually con  --  victed of perjury . He had denied that he was a mem  --  ber of the spy ring control  --  led by Chambers . But it was certainly difficult to imag  --  ine how he could have claimed that he never knew Chambers when ensconced in the Hiss home was an expensive Oriental rug which Chambers had bought for Mr. Alger Hiss as a gift with communist money . One thing was clear : Chambers could prove he had bought the rug and now Hiss had it . And then there was that typewriter .

Indeed any sensible man reading the case today would come to the same con  --  clusion . Hiss was in effect tried and convicted in 1949 for a crime com  --  mitted circa 1937 . The sympathies of enlightened ( and naive ) Ameri  --  cans toward the Soviet Union had changed thrice from 1938 to 1949 ; once when Hitler and Stalin had ruthlessly joined hands to rape Po  --  land , once again when Hitler at  --  tacked Russia , and finally when in postwar years the iron curtain fell across the face of Europe . Hiss was , for practical purposes , convicted for a 1937 deed by a jury and American public with 1949 values . Thus Hiss was tried and convicted for doing something in 1937 which his accuser Chambers freely and cheerfully ad  --  mitted he too had done . In truth the two opposites had worked in appar  --  ent concert . The conflict began in committee hearing rooms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  papers for two years , sandwiched between the Berlin Airlift and the Korean War . It was more than a long barrage of testimony . It was the meeting of the ideology of the gloomy Thirties and postwar Ameri  --  can moralism . It was n't just Alger Hiss on trial ; according to British journalist Alistair Cooke , it was " a generation on trial . " This writer was a working news photographer during the drawn-out investigation involving both Cham  --  bers and Hiss . The hearings were ma  --  jor news events month after month . I covered most of these and even trod in the pumpkin field after that dra  --  matic event was disclosed . So , here is a very brief summary of this histori  --  cal spy case . While a student at Columbia Uni  --  versity in 1925 , Chambers became a communist . " It was shortly after the war , " he said later . " Germany was in chaos , and partly occupied ; northern France and parts of Belgium were smashed to pieces . It seemed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soci  --  ety was not able to solve by the usual means . I then began to look around for the unusual means . I first studied British Fabian socialism , but re  --  jected it as unworkable in practice . I came to the writings of Marx and Lenin . They seemed to me to explain the nature of the crisis and what to do about it . " Many other Americans were turn  --  ing to communism in the face of the crises of the late Twenties and early Thirties . But it was n't until Cham  --  bers had been a member of the Corn  --  munist Party for seven years that he discovered the party maintained a variety of hidden , conspiratorial organizations called , collectively , the Underground or the Apparatus . Chambers learned of the Under  --  ground in 1932 , when he was asked to join . Before this time , he had used his abilities as a writer and an editor of The Daily Worker , the party 's of  --  ficial publication . Now he spent his time in a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in restaurants and movie theaters . Soon Chambers realized he was not working for the American Communist Party anymore ; he was actually in the employ of the Soviet Underground and the Comintern . He was in fact an agent for a foreign country . In 1934 , Chambers was trans  --  ferred to Washington , D.C. and was assigned to the " Ware Group , " one of the most successful espionage forces in American history . One of the leaders of that group , according to Chambers , was Alger Hiss . Chambers met Hiss in his first days in Washington . Chambers was known simply by the alias " Carl . " The two men became friends , and when Chambers set up his outpost in the top half of the Women 's Chris  --  tian Temperance Union Building in Baltimore , Hiss and his wife Priscilla were frequent visitors . When the Hisses moved from one house to an  --  other , the Chamberses accepted Hiss 's offer and occupied their old apartment until the lease ran out . The relationship was both a profes  --  sional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? and a per  --  sonal one  --  the mutual affection of the Hiss and Chambers families . When Hiss was appointed to a post in the State Department by the Assistant Secretary of State , he be  --  gan to work even more closely with Chambers . Hiss nightly obtained confidential government documents which he either retyped or gave to Chambers to be photographed . Chambers , in turn , handed most of the typed copies and photocopies over to his superiors in the Under  --  ground . In 1938 , Chambers broke with communism . He deserted his party simply by refusing to keep an ap  --  pointment with General Bykov , a Russian who had come to America to oversee the espionage operations . Chambers bought a gun and secretly moved his family to an obscule loca  --  tion . After a short time Chambers mustered up his courage and came out of hiding , living and working under his own name . " I left the Com  --  munist Party to fight it , " he wrote . Though Chambers began " fight  --  ing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't until 1948 that people began to listen to him . By that time , they were eager . On August 3 , 1948 , Chambers testified under subpoena before the House Un-American Activities Com  --  mittee . Chambers had decided , though , to tell the committee only of his former associates ' membership in the Communist Party , leaving out the details of the espionage opera  --  tion . One of the men he named was Alger Hiss . When Hiss was called to testify before the committee in executive session , he denied all of Chambers 's allegations and denied that he 'd ever known anyone by that name . Hiss , who had been unable to identify Chambers from photo  --  graphs , finally recognized Chambers as George Crosiey , a free-lance writ  --  er . He still denied all of Chambers 's charges and when Chambers re  --  peated those charges on a network broadcast of " Meet the Press , " Hiss filed suit . Chambers now went further than just stating that Hiss was a commu  --  nist . He now charged that Hiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable period of time . Hiss had steadfastly maintained that he never knew " a man called Whittaker Chambers . " It was not until Hiss had sued Chambers for libel that the famous " Pumpkin Papers " came to light , and Hiss was finally trapped . Like many other journalistic labels the " Pumpkin Papers " included more than what was inside the pumpkin . Actually two rolls of exposed film and one roll of blank film were hidden in the pumpkin by Chambers , who feared communist agents might get them . The total papers included the film which consisted of microfilm copies of State Department documents , official records typed on the Wood  --  stock typewriter owned by Hiss and a few other duplicates of govern  --  mental records , many in Hiss 's own handwriting . Hiss had given these to Chambers , who should have passed them along to his Soviet agents  --  Chambers had hedged his bet and ' secreted some of the material away for protection . I was not around , of course , when Benedict Arnold was doing his dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still the most famous of Ameri  --  can spies . What the history books will say about the Chambers-Hiss case remains to be seen . McCarthy  --  ism and overzealous congressional investigations of the era will get a big play . The fact that irrefutable evi  --  dence shows there was a time when an espionage ring directed by a for  --  eign power flourished in America will do well to rate a footnote in history . It was a famous case twenty-five years ago . Many prominent political figures were involved . Young Representa tive Richard Nixon ( Republican , California ) led the battle against Hiss from his post on the House Un American Activities Committee . President Harry Truman called the whole thing a " red herring . " The ef fort to pin down Hiss as a spy was a major news story month after month . However , with newspapers such as the Washington Post support ing Hiss , many people were not quite Continued on page 89 continued from page 85 Nure whether it was Hiss or Chambers who was the culprit . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerfully confessed and implicated the other . The statute of limitations had run out for both for the crime of espionage . Through long hearings , Hiss proved to be a brilliantly slippery witness . He was well spoken and acted properly indignant when ac  --  cused . He received generally favor  --  able press as well as the strong en  --  dorsement of Secretary of State Dean Acheson , who announced , " I do not intend to turn my back on Alger Hiss . " Add to this Truman 's " red herring " remark and very unu  --  sual appearances of Supreme Court Associate Justices Felix Frankfurter and Stanley Reed who were Hiss 's character witnesses , and Hiss became in the minds of many a man with credentials beyond reproach . At times , the tables seemed turned against Chambers , what with all the notables and influential members of the press siding with Hiss . Eventually convicted , Hiss was sentenced to five years in prison . Whittaker Chambers had resigned from his post as Senior Editor of Time during the hearings and trials . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was serialized in the Post ) . He died in 1961 . Alger Hiss served forty-four months of his five-year term , and since has held a number of jobs ( in  --  cluding that of a clerk in a New York stationery shop ) . It was the persistence of the House Un-American Activities Com  --  mittee , the mistake Hiss himself made in suing Chambers for libel , and the evidence of the " Pumpkin Papers " which finally led to the con  --  viction of Mr. Hiss by the New York Federal Court jury . Now , the frail seventy-year-old man has been readmitted to the Mas  --  sachusetts bar so that he can practice law in that state . Years ago , although Congress had passed a special law to prevent his getting a pension for his eleven years at the State Depart  --  ment , he won his pension remunera  --  tion by a court order . Last fall , Hiss appeared at the Washington Press Club and reported he was studying old FBI files searching for evidence which might lead to his complete vindication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked to the present not only by the rising tide of concern over espionage activities , but also by the fact that the Hiss-Chambers affair , for the first time , dramatized the power of television as a stage for national events . Television fulfilled its role as the electronic reporter , developing a new kind of history  --  the history of immediacy . But the photographs taken at the scene also have their place on the record . Thanks to them , the years roll back and time stands still , and the strange case of the Pumpkin Papers comes center stage once again . 53
