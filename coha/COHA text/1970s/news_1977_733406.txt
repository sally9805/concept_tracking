txt In the opinion of almost all who have studied the matter , the 2,000 managers of New York City 's 186,000 employees need a raise . Although managers comprise the eleven highest grades of the New York City civil ' service , some at the lower end earn less than their unionized subordinates . That is because managers have had raises of only 14 to 20 percent since 1971 , while the workers whose pay is set by collective bargaining have received raises of 35 percent , in spite of the 1975 wage freeze . Managers  --  whose skills are described by such titles as budget examiner. park manager , housing rehabilitation specialist  --  are public servants whose value is so great that they are easily lost to other.employers . Appropriate raises for them would cost about $5 million a ' year  --  but would save money by saving leadership . What should be simple has been confounded by political and psychological problems . No one balks at the thought of raising the lowest-paid career managers , who won their rank in competitive examination , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special study group headed by Patrick Scollard of Equitable Life . But a quarter of the managers are noncompetitive appointees , some of whom , in the higher grades , earn $40,000 . Failure to raise them would mean that their subordinates might earn as much or more than they . Raising them would put their salaries above those paid to some commissioners ( $40,000-$47,000 ) . Raise the commissioners and they would surpass the elected Borough Presidents at $45,000 , and the Deputy Mayors , now at $47,000-$50,000 . Raise the Deputy Mayors and they approach the Mayor himself , at $60,000 . Mr. Scollard 's panel found a way out : Raise the Mayor to $70,000 , and expand the salary range below enough to string out the eleven grades rationally . This , however , would have to be done in the next three weeks , because the salaries of elected officials must be established by the City Council whose members earn less than any of the managers ? $20,000 . Councilmen can not raise their own pay during their term of office . They can only vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is signed into law before then . Mayor Beame says he will sign such a law only if Mayor-elect Koch requests it . Mr. Koch wo n't . He thinks it unwise to raise the pay of elected officials while he demands that the unionized workers hold down their wage contract demands . He remembers the outcry raised last year when Congress justifiably increased its salaries . Meanwhile , the City Council has moved to raise its part-time members ' future salaries by $10,000 , rather than the $5,000 recommended by the Scollard committee . Mayor Beame vows to veto this bill ; the Council could probably override , and Mr. Koch would lose control of the matter . Nothing would have been done for the managers , whose pay can be raised at the direction of the Mayor . If the middle- and upper-level managers are to get the raises due them , in the pattern recommended , Mr. Koch 's team has but two choices : either live with salaries that will be lower than those of their subordinates , or bring themselves to accept raises that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision is short . We would support a raise for all , on the Scollard committee model . The Mayor of New York need not be embarrassed by a $70,000 salary when the Governor earns $85,000 and the Chairman of the Transit Authority earns $80,000 . But if he fears the public and the unions will react negatively , Mr. Koch could raise the civil service salaries by administrative action , while asking his commissioners , his other temporary appointees , and elected officials to contribute to the city all or part of the increase . Mr. Beame did this in 1975 . Despite the political problems . that the issue poses , the Mayor-elect . can count on general support for a management pay plan that makes city government more efficient .
