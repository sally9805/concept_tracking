THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ANUMBER of prominent Americans on both the political right and the political eft , discouraged by the nation 's failure in recent years to export its form of government to Vietnam or any other part of the world , have begun to wonder whether or not the American democracy still has a role to play in world affairs . Some recent remarks by Secretary Br ezhnev suggest that it does . In a speech at the European security conference in Helsinki , Brezhnev , using words to mean the reverse of what they would ordinarily mean to us , said , " It is no secret that information media can serve the purposes of peace and confidence or they can spread throughout the world the poison of discord between countries and peoples . We would like to hope that the results of the conference will serve as a correct guideline for cooperation in these areas . " According to the Party line these days , both dissidence within the Soviet Union and criticism without must be suppressed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " discord between countries " that Brezhnev was talking about in his speech . We were reminded that in the Watergate years the Russian government quickly ganged up with the Nixon White House in attacking the American press . Leonid Zamyatin , of the Tass news agency , commenting on President Nixon 's faIl from office , remarked over Moscow television , " A very definite brainwashing of public opinion was taking place on both radio and television , and it certainly was not in favor of President Nixon . " This alliance of the Soviet and American governments against the American press seemed odd until one reflected that the American press consistently plays very much the same role with respect to the Soviet government that it plays with respect to the United States governmem . The Soviet Union , lacking a free press of its own , Ends itself under the critical eye of only the press in free countries . The free countries , moreover , provide dissidents within the Soviet Union a chance to make their voices heard around the world . No rival totalitarian nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solzhenitsyn or a Sakharov in this way ; a voice emanating from another unfree nation is as suspect as any voice that is allowed to speak in the Soviet Union itself . Only voices that emanate from an atmosphere of freedom can win the trust that gives them their power , In recent months , a number of other governments have lodged protests against newsmen from abroad . Last June , the Indian government demanded that journalists submit their stories for clearance , and expelled those who refused . In Spain last September , when a large part of Europe , including the Vatican , protested the execution of five men who had been convicted of terrorism after rigged trials , the government laid the blame for the protest on the world press . From Czechoslovakia last August , a reminder came of just how far governments in our time are willing to go to suppress information : an article on the Op-Ed page of the Times reported that the police were breaking into writers ' apartments and confiscating manuscripts before the texts could be dis seminated . The prospects for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ; however , free nations have a role to play which does not require expansion . For nations whose governments are bent on extirpating the past , the free world which is to say those countries where liberties actually exist  --  can serve as a memory . The pasts of these nations are , in a manner of speaking , refugees , and the free world can take them in , into its libraries and schools . For nations in which the truth about the present is suppressed , the free world can serve as a forum . Thus , simply by existing , and by securing and perfecting its liberties , the free world is able to serve the globe as librarian , archivist , and sounding hoard  --  as custodian of whatever can be known about a world that does not want to know very much about itself . ? ? Freespace U ARECENT visit to Freespace Alternate U suggests to us that that cheery figure from recently bygone days  --  the peppy , hardworking American anarchist  --  is being nudged perilously close to extinction . Freespace U @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nightmare . It is a collectively run institution with neither faculty nor officers , no semesters , no registration or required fees , no study halls , no dunce cap , no basketball ream . People show up when they feel like it . The main campus at Freespace U is a one-room third-floor walkup on Lafayette Street , a cozy time warp in which the anarchist elite occasionally meet . It has folding chairs , file cabinets , handwritten notices posted on the walls , a blackboard , an electric space heater in the middle of the floor , a bookcase loaded with soft-core and hard-core anarchist tomes , a vague aura of mistrust in the air  --  the usual stuff . A message on the JANUARY 1 2 , 1 9 7 blackboard the other day said , " Our pre-evaluation of common-stock equity shows X-rays on the upswing . " The room is an excellent period piece ; just being there must make the average armchair nihilist want to argue with his fellow-man over the merits of anarchosyndicalism , vanguardism , and radical conformism . Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few members of the general public showed up for a Freespace U freebie lecture and gallery tour called " SoHo Art Through Anarchist Eyes , " led by Thomas Y. Brink . The tour began an hour late , because of some travel hangup Mr. Brink ran into in the Newark PATH station on the way over from his home , in New Jersey . When he finally arrived , he passed out cards that said , " ANARTCHY , DECLASSIFY , DEMATERIALIZE , DESECRATE , DENY , WITHDRAW ! " " That about says it all , " Mr. Brink explained . Nine people started out on the tour , including at least six anarchists : a welder from Milwaukee in town for the holidays ; a buddy of his from West Virginia ; two vegetarian restaurateurs from Vermont ; a middle-aged woman , who told us she is an apprentice anarchist ; and Thomas Brink himself , a journeyman . We stuck close to Mr. Brink , following him through about a half-dozen SoHo galleries , and al though he saw a lot that he said was " interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juices . In one gallery , he said that a floor-to-ceiling storage bin filled with large canvases was " interesting " because no one could see what paintings were stored inside . In another gallery , someone asked if a certain doorway was minimal art . " Yes , " said Mr. Brink . " That 's pretty minimal . Interesting . " After an hour or so , or by the time the walking tour reached the Holly Solomon Gallery , on West Broadway , the crowd had dwindled to four people . In one room at Holly Solomon , we almost tripped over a couple of small metal sculptures on the floor . Mr. Brink , who has an open mind and a charitable heart , decided that the metal pieces were part of some integrated " environment . " " It 's interesting what 's going on with environments , " he said . " They 've become involvement art . Just like that . I 've been going to galleries for twenty-five years now . Actually , it 's just one vast flow of stuff . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pryor TWO things we know about Richard Pryor for sure : he is the funniest man in America , and , after Muhammad Ali , he is the baddest person anywhere . " Bad " here does not mean rotten or no good . It means being so extraordinarily good at doing something that for someone to call you the greatest , or anything like that , does not quite measure up to describing how incredible you are . Only the word " bad " will do . For instance , not long ago we saw Pryor performing at the Felt Forum , in Madison Square Garden , and he said things that are usually considered uncomplimentary about blacks , whites , and women , and the audience , which was made up of blacks , whites , and women , laughed and laughed . He was in town the other day , and around dinnertime we stopped by his suite at the Regency Hotel for a chat with him . Before we had a chance to say hello , he stuck a finger out and showed us a ring he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's nice . Ai n't pimpy at all . " We looked . It was a slim , plain gold hand decorated with three delicately set diamonds . Then we looked at him . We had never before seen him close up , and noticed that he is quite handsome . He is tall , slim ( he was dieting , he said ) , with a boyish face that is especially nice when he smiles , He was wearing tapered gray trousers , a mottled black-and-white sweater , and brown mules . In his rooms with him were a woman he introduced as his girl friend ; his manager ; his valet ; and his jeweller . We spent three hours with him , and during that time this is what happened : he bought a gold necklace with a heart-shaped , diamond-studded pendant for the woman he had introduced as his girl friend ; he bought a gold ring for his manager and a gold ring for his valet ; he wrote a check for sixteen hundred dollars to his jeweller ; he ordered a dinner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from the hotel ; he picked up his spinach with his bare hands and said with a British accent , " I like my spinach squeeze-dried , do n't you ; " when the telephone rang , he spoke into his mules ; during dinner , he watched " The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite " and mimicked Walter Cronkite many times ; after dinner , he disappeared for a while with a copy of U. S. Newt &; World Retort . When he was not mimicking Walter Cronkite , these are some of the things he said : " I am now a vegetarian . I was standing at the corner of Forty-second Street , and this man came up to me and said , ' Rise , and go forth and he a vegetarian . ' One thing I can say  --  I was lucky he did n't pick my pocket . Vegetables arc funny . They have a great sense of humor . You drop their seeds in the ground and they rub around in the dirt and then they grow up and you can eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One will be standing on his head , another on his ass , and another on his foot . Politician to Negro : ' Look , buddy , this is what I can do for you . ' Negro to politician : Man , will you take your foot of my mother ? ' I 'm trying to figure out things to sell to the Chinese . They do n't dig Joe ? iMaggio . How about an album of Mao 's greatest hits ? I was born under the sign of funny . I have n't met the other people born under that sign yet , but I think a couple of them became scientists . You know how I get to be funny ? I go to sleep for about a year . I wake up with cobwebs all over my face . I roll them up in a large ball with milk and sugar , eat it quickly , and then I start laughing . People say , What 's so funny ? I tell them .

" Old Skippers HERE is a note from a young woman we know who left New York a few years back for the good life in the village of Castine , up on Penobscot Bay , Maine : It 's deep winter . I do n't just mean that it 's January , or that Christmas is over . Those are city definitions . I mean that I am sitting here at the kitchen table wondering whether to open up my last jar of homemade blackberry jam and invite the neighbors in for a tea party by the fire or to hoard that precious jam for just a little longer , and both those impulses , I 'm told , are sure deep-win ter signs . There are other signs , of course . The snowstorms this week . A mean , howling wind today . The birches in the woods behind the house are brittle with frost now , and the only boats in the harbor are the Eat and sturdy craft that drag the bay for scallops . My neighbors , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , they have stopped talking about the weather and have begun to trade their annual opinions on old and new Presidents and the cost of living . Castine is a town where people talk about the war and mean the Revolutionary War . It is a town with a long view , and I am beginning to adjust to it . / love Castine . I love the old white wooden houses , built for big families and long winters , and / especially love the harbor , which opens onto Penobscot Bay . The harbor sky is still filled with gulls and cormorants , and if you watch for them you can see young seals swimming in from their rocky little islands at the tip of the bay to have a look around . The things people here admire are the things they can count on , like visits from seals in January , or blackberry bushes in the woods , or eagles ' nests on Pond Island . ( That 's my favorite island here . ) They would sooner listen to a seafaring man than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Castine . They carry the past of the town in their heads . They can show you exactly where each of the forty-three boats of the Penobscot Expedition went down before the Tory fleet . They can tell you what it feels like to cross the Atlantic in December in a four-roasted schooner . And they make certain that every village youngster in these halcyon days of pleasure boats and summer vacations has a proper respect for the sea and a proper knowledge of the bay channels and tides and the fretful coast winds . Penobscot Bay captains come in all varieties : old ones , of eighty-five or ninety , who used to make the swordfish run to Boston ; voung ones , of seventy , who still go out after scallops on a freezing winter sea and , on days like today , count their overboard survival time as a little short of three minutes . In the middle of August , every year for twenty-four years now , the town has paid its respects to these captains with a big sailing race . I want to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the blackberry jam . It is officially called the Maine Retired Skippers ' Race . Nobody ever calls it that , though . People call it the Old Skippers ' Race for the very good reason that nobody around here ever stops working . There are a few requirements if you want to sail in the Old Skippers ' Race . You have to have been born in Maine , you have to be at least sixtyfi ve , and you have to have been in command of a boat at one time or another in your life , though it does n't really matter if that boat was an eight-foot dory or a battleship . The important thing is that you are by temperament a seafaring man  --  and are not too embarrassed to race twelve miles for pure pleasure in an elegant sloop or yawl that usually belongs to a summer person or a local big shot . No old skipper I know was ever that embarrassed . I have watched a few Old Skippers ' Races by now , but my favorite is still my first one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skippers and owners sailing together , and the list included the first woman skipper in anybody 's memory , as well as a fisherman of seventy-five , who said that he was substituting for his father , who was ninety-eight and " not up to it . " I went CO that race with Rear Admiral John Kennaday , United States Navy , Retired , whom everybody in town calls Captain Jack . Captain Jack and his wife , Jeanette , are my next-door neighbors . Jeanette keeps my little girl supplied with homemade cookies and likes nasturtiums as much as I do , and Captain Jack has helped us through our first Maine winters by teaching us all about celestial navigation . They are the best neighbors I have ever had . Captain Jack is seventy-three and an Annapolis man . He has been in command of all sorts of important naval vessels , but , like most men of his particular accomplishments , he never boasts about it , When I first asked Captain Jack about his adventures in the Second World War , he told me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you do n't count the Battle of Okinawa . " Like the town , Captain Jack takes a long view . I think he has even forgiven his mother for having him somewhere like New York or New Jersey a geographical misfortune that makes him ineligible for the Old Skippers ' Race . He has long been the chairman of the race committee , though , and runs everything from the bridge of a big steel cutter that the Coast Guard always put at his disposal , Boarding the cutter from a launch is very exciting . I remember that there was a thick fog from the east the afternoon of my first Old Skippers ' Race , and the sailboats glided in and out of it like ghost vessels from " The Flying Dutchman , " I thought the fog was beautiful and mysterious , but Captain Jack , I recall , thought things would he more beautiful if you could see the sailboats better , and so , I imagine , did all the people who were trying to watch the start of the race from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that frames the harbor . Mrs. Kennaday had made lemonade and blueberry cakes and dozens of sandwiches , because she knows from experience that waiting around on a Coast Guard cutter always makes people very hungry . We had all been up late the night before at a dinner for the old skippers , swapping stories about races and doing a lot of speculating about the doctor from down the coast who had been found adrift in the hay the week before with a pair of panty hose wrapped around the tiller of his boat . I remember wondering whether the skippers were tired out from the party . One skipper of seventy-seven  --  he 's probably out scalloping today  --  had stayed up all night afterward hauling lobster traps . He said he wanted to make up some of the time and money he 'd lose racing . The skipper I was rooting for is an all-purpose fisherman . His name is Paul Eastman , and he is a shy , very courtly person  --  he is only in his sixties  --  who smokes a corncob pipe and usually wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , and I was afraid that he 'd been out all night hauling , because I knew that the prospect of a day off , sailing , made him feel a little like a loafer . But Paul looked fresh to me when he tacked past the cutter to the starting line . All the old skippers looked fresh , actually . Some of them were dressed up in their church suits . Captain Jack would point them out to me . " That 's Captain Black , " he 'd say , for example . " Captain Black never sails this race without a tie . " I liked Captain Marcoux , who sailed by in a suit and a hat and a life preserver . Paul Eastman himself used to wear a black derby to the Old Skippers ' Race . He had misplaced the hat that year and never found it , and was very disappointed , since he likes to have a nice hat to doff when the race committee 's toy cannon is fired and the race begins . Paul is usually first over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is only twenty-six feet and is in the class that gets to begin five minutes before any of the bigger yachts . Julie belongs to another neighbor of mine , named John P. Gardner . John was raised in Castine and has come back to settle here , with his wife and their small daughter , after seventeen years as a pier superintendent in Brooklyn . He is the best sailor in town , and he especially loves races  --  any kind of races . If you asked John to race you across the road , he 'd grease his shoes first  --  that 's how my husband says to describe him . John had grounded Julie at low tide the night before the race , and cleaned and waxed her hull , so that she would he able to whip across the starting line ahead of everybody else 's boat , which is just what happened . There were a lot of cheers from the Head as Paul Eastman sailed Julie off into the fog , heeling smartly , with John at the sheets and his crew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Most of the people from around here were rooting for them , just like me , because John and Paul are considered such fine seafaring men . Paul builds his own lobstering boats in the yard behind his cabin , near town , and he cares for them as if they were his children . As for John  --  John 's father was a Castine captain , and so John has what he calls " a kind of deep , ancestral sea feeling . " He said to his wife , Elaine , before they moved back here that the happiest moment of his life would be the moment he sailed his own boat into Castine Harbor -- and that 's exactly what he did . He sailed Julie up the Atlantic coast from Brooklyn , with a crew of one , and arrived in glory . Castine likes it when children come home , and respects them for it , too , because life on the sea here is hard work and a financial struggle . Anyway , I stood on the bridge of the Point Hannon  --  that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastman and young John Gardner until Captain Jack told inc that if I wanted to watch the race with the race-committee chairman I had to he impartial . So I cheered the rest of the boats as they sailed off and disappeared , one by one , into that thick Maine fog . It was cold on the deck of the cutter . I remember that when all the sailboats were out of sight we sat cLuwn in a huddle against an ammunition box with a big " Danger " sign on THE NEW YORKER 25 it and ate up the sandwiches . After a few hours , the judges ' boat , which is a super-fast inboard , pulled up , and someone on it told me that Julie had been out ahead for the first two legs but now the wind had come up . There was nothing to do but wait . Jeanette Kennaday and I passed the time swapping recipes . She gave me her famous Oki Skippers ' Race cocktail dip : cream cheese , devilled ham , horseradish , lemon juice , and whatever else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave her . At about four o'clock , we sighted the first returning boat , and Captain jack stood on the bridge with his charts and his signal flags and his stopwatch . The boat turned out to he a thirty-three-foot cruising sloop . The next boat in was a forty-foot cruising sloop . That left third place , so I crossed my fingers and closed my eyes , and when I opened them , there was Paul Eastman sailing Julie across the finish line . Later , there was a lot of celebrating at the town dock . Paul got a copper trophy with an anchor on it . He stood there holding it and sucking on his corncob pipe , and he looked so proud that photographers from newspapers as far away as Bangor came up and took his picture . He told them that when he and John sailed in the Old Skippers ' Race the year before , they had stowed a quart of whiskey aboard to warm them up if the winds got chilly , and that that was the reason they had only come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took on hoard was a one-shot bottle the kind that air-lines hand out . Then he headed home to his cabin , because he wanted to get a good night 's sleep for lobstering in the morning . He prefers lobstering to any other kind of fishing . The day is longer , but the work has its compensations , since a obsterman gets to stay in bed till five in the morning . " I never looked hack today , not once  --  not even in that darned last leg , when I knew that the big yachts must be catching up , " Paul said , I recall , as he went off . And Captain Jack agreed that this was the right way to sail . It was a fine race , Captain Jack said . The best ever . People here are still talking about it , comparing the boats and the handicaps and the seamanship of the twenty-eight skippers . One of my neighbors told me today- that if politicians respected their countries the way good captains respect the sea , we would not be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old skippers have it . That 's why people here pay so much attention to them . Old skippers represent the proper attitudes .
