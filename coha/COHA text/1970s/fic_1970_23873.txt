FATHER BUH BUH BOO a story by Joseph Sweat THE EDITORS OF MY NEWSPAPER tend toward bias . phemy . That 's why they insisted I interview Father James Buhl on Sunday . " A priest wears a different ass on Sunday , " said the managing editor . The editors knew the surface facts . They read the stories I wrote at the time of Father Buhl 's arrest last spring . There was a story when he was charged , with statements from the assistant district attorney explaining the reason for each charge  --  assault and battery , creating a public nuisance , indecent exposure . Then there was a second story when he was removed as pastor of Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church on W Street . But they kept badgering me to find out exact why Father Buhl attacked the sit  --  in group at I church , particularly since the group included Fad Buhl 's assistant , Father Charles Garibaldi , And cently the editors insisted again that I get on w : unearthing that deeper story , adding the spice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Feast of St. Peter Claver , ti eventful day of the sit-in . And they were insisti that the diggings should begin on Sunday , for Go sake . " Ask him more about the birds . " the city edi said . He put his head down on the desk and laugh " That old sacerdotal bastard . " Father Buhl agreed to see me again , I suppose , because he knew my newspaper would not print anything really damaging . We had talked twice before . once immediately after his arrest and again when the bishop removed him from his pastorate . He seemed to understand when I told him my editors would forgo printing embarrassing facts if only those facts were made available to our journalistic hierarchy . " My hierarchy likes to gossip too , " Father Buhl said on the phone . Also , he knew that our management , inclined as it is to a more traditional view of life , would hold some warmth for a man who took such a vigorous approach in dealing with youthful rebels . Our managing editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " funniest church thing since Jesus drove the gamblers out with a bullwhip . " And I said , " Yes , I 'll bet that was funny . " Father Buhl looks like a nutcracker . He should smoke one of those stubby , curved pipes  --  the kind you would expect a nutcracker to smoke . Instead , he smokes a Kaywoodie billiard sending angel 's hair puffing before him with the aroma of London Dock . And there is an accompanying tune : air and spit sucked through the teeth . " Father O'Malley smoked a pipe like this , " Father Buhl said . " Father O'Malley ? " " Yes , O'Malley . Bing Crosby in Going My Way . You certainly seen it . Ai n't you Catholic ? " " Oh yes , Father , " I said . " Certainly , O'Malley . " " Do you think I look like O'Malley ? I 've been told often that I do . But know-it-all Father Garibaldi  --  in that singsong , squeaky , little queer voice of his ... No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him to go on . He leaned forward , sucked his pipe , and twisted his mouth sour lemon . His head rocked from side to side like a clown doll with a spring neck as he said , " The little queer put it this way ( imitating ) , ' Well , Father , I think you look more like Father Fitzgibbon . ' ( Here Father Buhl waved a limp wrist . ) You know you look more like Barry Fitzgerald than Bing Crosby . ' " Father Buhl jammed his pipe into his mouth and withdrew it again with a jerk . The edges of his nostrils curled outward . " That 's what the little fairy son-of-a-bitch said . " My interview with Father Buhl took place in the parlor of St. Joseph 's Church on K Street , where he now serves as associate pastor . I was met at the door and escorted to the parlor by an ancient Irish housekeeper , the kind who seems to he issued as standard equipment with Catholic rectories . She was stooped and slid her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the priest and I talked , I could hear her shoes sl : : ing about the house , the sound changing as it emanated from kitchen linoleum or hall hardwood or bedroom carpet . " Miss Katie ! " Father Buhl yelled at one point . " Would you please stop that damn sliding ? " The sliding stopped for a few moments , then began again . Father Buhl considered the events of the Feast of St. Peter Claver and preceding developments . In retrospect they had a dream quality , like home movies shot through gauze . " Dissent is a lot of crap , " he said . " A lot of liberal crap . Any chairpussy can sniff around in pansyland all night and squeak-mouse against authority by day . " He rapped his Kaywoodie billiard on the mahogany finish of the chair arm . " But a real man  --  a man like O'Malley  --  will be true and noble and endowed with character . He will rise up like the stag of the forest and greet the new day filled with rest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antlers and ask what his superiors would have him do . Did you see The Bells of St. Mary ? " " Yes , Bing Crosby also ? " " O'Malley , " Father Buhl said . " Father O'Malley . Oh . God , how great he was . " He looked around the room to make certain we were alone . His voice dropped to a whisper . " I 've been told by some very discerning folks that I look most like O'Malley in that particular movie . He used a certain jut of the chin in that picture . " Father Buhl winked , pointed his finger at me like a pistol and jutted his chin to one side in a knowing fashion . But then his mouth rolled sourly forward . " Father Garibaldi said I looked more like Ingrid Bergman . Goddamn little fruit . " As Sunday afternoon flowed on and seemed to leave us behind in that rectory room . Father Buhl spun out his memories of recent events . Our Lady of the Lake had been Father Garibaldi 's first assignment following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wop , " Father Buhl had said . The young priest had received Holy Orders from the palsied hands of an old Swiss bishop at the Altar of the Chair in the apse beyond Michelangelo 's great dome in the Basilica of St. Peter . " I toured Italy once , " Father Buhl said . " Can you imagine a whole country full of dagos ? I led one of them spiritual tours . Studied for months on the language  --  a as in pane , e as in sevro , o as in more , and all that . " When the young priest had arrived at the rectory Father Buhl had shaken his hand and presented him a bottle of Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi . They would spend long days together , Father Buhl had said , with the pastor training his curate in the lore of the priesthood . For dinner they had had bistecca alkt Fiorentina and broccoli ella Romana . " White wine does not go with steak , " Father Garibaldi had said . " And for my part , tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had used the Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi for altar wine . Father Buhl had then lectured him on using " those materials  --  such as the proper altar wine  --  which have come down from Christ himself and which the Church in her wisdom has passed on to us . " As the months passed the two men came to the point of open hostility . Meals were taken separately . Communication was handled most often via notes thumbtacked to bedroom doors . Father Buhl : I wish to have an evening Mass for young people . We plan to use guitars . Charles Garibaldi Absolutely not . Father James Buhl . Pastor Father Garibaldi : I understand you are parading around town in sports clothes . Quit making an ass of yourself or I will have you removed from the priesthood . Father James Buhl , Pastor ( no answer ) Father Buhl : I need to visit a friend out of town next Tuesday and Wednesday . I have arranged for someone to say my Masses . Charles Garibaldi Permission denied . Father James Buhl , Pastor Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church iVednesday- afternoon . We plan to invite other ministers to join us in praying for an end to racial injustice . Charles Garibaldi Christ 's Church is no place for politics . Permission denied . Father James Bahl , Pastor Father Buhl : We plan to meet with or without your per . mission . This could become a sit-in in protest against your medieval mentality . Charles Garibaldi Father Garibaldi : It has conic to my attention again that you are parading around town in sports clothes . Frankly , people think you look like a queer . This is the last warning . Either stop this immoral and scandalous practice or I will have you drummed out . Father James Buhl , Pastor Screw you . Charles Garibaldi 13A , CKIINC HIS KAYWOODIE BILLIARD with London 1- Dock , Father Buhl recalled that the Feast of St. Peter Claver did not " have a Bing Crosby type of morning . " In fact , he suspected it was the kind of day the movie crews would " sit around and play cards while Bing and the other stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back there like a marble . He winked , squinched air through the side of his mouth , pointed his finger gun at me , and recalled that the violins began to build as he walked from the rectory on that gloomy day . He remembered noting it would not be a good day for shooting . The light was bad . And they die always seem to shoot Bing 's movies in good light But oh the violins , riding in smoothly over the bras : and the woodwinds , and building , faint when hi emerged from the rectory , climbing in swirls an getting louder as he crossed the drive , building t a peak as he alighted the side steps of the church Yes , the light was bad . But the background music demanded some bit of showmanship , some appro priate gesture to close the scene . He executed on . flawless run of the softshoe , turned with a rippling of the outstretched arm and saluted the sun . Bu there was no sun . The salute , then , would he for i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was salute for all the sky on this day of darkness . Bu there would have been no shooting anyway and , n. doubt , those in the audience would not have bee warmed by his salute . How , Father Buhl wondered would O'Malley have closed a scene like that ? him there would have been hope of bringing it of3 As he mused of O'Malley , Father Buhl vested fo Mass . He was in the final stages of this ritual whe thc tardy altar boy appeared . The priest began rebuff , but cut short to wonder : how would O'Ma ley have handled this ? " Son , " he said . " Let me sing you a little son that may help you in this situation . " No . O'Malley never would have introduced that way . " Son , let me ask you a question . " Father Buhl pulled the cincture around his stun ach . His fingers patted the soft mound of flesh i rhythm to the intro played by Paul Whiteman an the orchestra . On the proper note , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinking eyes and slack jas Father Buhl sang : " Would you like to SI% ing on star/ Carry moonbeams home in a jar .. . " Mass ran twenty minutes late that morning . " You see , my boy , " said Father Buhl , " you n. only are in danger of becoming a mule , but yc have made us late for Mass . " He chuckled behind his hand lest this impre sionable youngster think him too forward . Father Buhl rattled off the prayers of the Ma that day . Not a word was bobbled . And from b hind this screen of words and gestures he watcht the audience . They must be watched carefully , yi know , for signs of their reaction to the perfori ance . This was important to Bing  --  he said so on in a magazine interview  --  and it should be impc tant to those like him . those endowed with certa features and certain quality of voice . The Gospel for the Feast of St. Peter Claver taken from the tenth chapter of Luke : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , said to Jesus : ' And who is my neighbor ? ' As he read the Gospel , Father Buhl thought Father Garibaldi . He wanted to sweep such though from his mind , but they persisted . From thc thoughts grew visions of Father Garibaldi and I friends storming the Church in their bright spo clothes . They were fluttering into the sanctuary li tropical birds . In fact , Father Buhl was sure he sz a green barbet and two rainbow I.orikeets swe down the aisle and perch upon the communion rail . Then , he said , a Donaldson 's touraco w ith an orange topknot drank from the baptismal font with a gurgling sound . A lilac-breasted roller actually fluttered through the window . And the bird carried a guitar . Then all the birds sang folk songs . Later at least three witnesses who had attended Mass on the Feast of St. Peter Claver said they were startled when Father Buhl stopped reading the Gospel and shouted , " If any of you get bird crap on those pews I 'd wring your necks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... ' Which of these three , in your opinion , was neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers ? ' He answered , The one who treated him with compassion . ' Jesus said to him , ' Go and act like him . ' " The birds did not return for the duration of the Mass . " In my opinion the folk songs were out of place , " Father Buhl told me there in the rectory at St. Joseph 's . And the air whistled through his Kaywoodie billiard as he blew it for cleaning . Then he filled it with London Dock , occasionally lifting a pinch to his nostrils for a whiff . " I do n't believe I ever saw Bing smell his tobacco , " he said . A pinch was en route to his nostrils , but he hurriedly stuffed it in his pipe . " It seemed to me the folk songs were vulgar too , " he said . " I know I heard a few damns and hells . And if I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quite fund of flaunting their immorality , you know . Just listen to them . La . La , sleep all night in the meadow with my true love , la , la , la . Now you 're no priest , but you know anybody who sleeps all the night in some hayfield with a fish-fag woman is out there primarily to ... to make feet for children 's stockings . " lie rolled the small laugh around in his throat . He winked and squinched air through the side of his mouth . Sucking in great rushes of air , he lit his pipe . For a moment I could not see his face behind the billows of smoke . His hand fanned the smoke and , as it cleared , he bent low to see me , like a Winslow Homer seafarer trying to peer through the fog . " I do n't recall Bing ever singing a folk song , " he said , " Is n't that something ? " When the vision of the birds occurred . Father Buhl decided to make a Bing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a scene that opened and closed with 72-frame dissolves and Paul Whiteman 's band segueing in louder and louder and then , at the close , fading out . It was " really a aeautiful way to get an idea . " Nonviolent , direct action , Father Buhl knew , was powerful weapon . But he could not recall a single ) olice chief or college administrator who had tried his approach . He would do combat with song . " But lot folk songs , good wholesome American songs . " He seemed to recall a scene in which Bing Crosby ang to birds . Perhaps it was only conjecture as to Low Mr. Crosby might have sung to birds if he had ' een given the chance . To be precise , the scene in Father Buhl 's mind was of Bing as Father O'Malley singing to birds . " I 'm sure of one thing , " Father Buhl said . " The birds in the scene were not homosexual . " The laugh wobbled in his throat . He winked , squinched air from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun . " ... nor Communist , " rr HE PROTEST BEGAN LATER THAT MORNING as 1 Father Garibaldi , four other priests , a Protestant minister with a guitar , a couple of college coeds , and a black , grim-faced man with a goatee marched to the front door of Our Lady of the Lake . Father Buhl was waiting , standing at parade rest . " May we come in ? " asked Father Garibaldi . " Sir , " Father Buhl said , " for what purpose do you and your disruptive band approach these holy and sacred premises ? " " Oh , well , we just happened to be passing by and thought we 'd drop in for a snort of holy water . Are you the bartender ? " The hair just above Father Buhl 's white collar stood on end . He surveyed the marchers in the manner of a military inspector walking up and down the line , stopping before each person , then lie walked back to the door and addressed Father Garibaldi again : " Some of your curious crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . holy and Catholic Church . " " No . We are disguised . Really , we are eunuchs come to change the toilet paper in the girls ' rest room . " One of Ole priests began laughing . " Fin sorry , " said Father Buhl , " but in my best judgment you arc here to do nothing more than profane this sacred place . I ca n't let you enter my church . " " It 's not your goddamned church to keep us out of , " said Father Garibaldi . He pushed Father Buhl aside and led the others inside , directing them to take scats in the back pews . Father Buhl remained beside the door , in the same spot where he had been shoved by Father Garibaldi . He felt ill and tried to calm his stomach by taking deep breaths . According to his plan . if the stand in the doorway failed , the second phase was to be the secret weapon of song . But he could n't sing if he got sick . Inside the protesters were singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . Gon na tell old Buhl we shall not be moved . Jost like a tree standing by the water We shall not be moved . They sang many songs throughout the afternoon as news of the protest reached the people of the city . Soon a crowd of onlookers gathered . Some remained outside , standing on the lawn and discussing the emotional scene that was building before them , listening to the songs  --  the sounds of which grew louder each time the church door opened . A few of the curious ventured inside , including one woman who lectured the protesters on " this sacrilege , this blasphemy . And we wo n't tolerate it , by God . " A television cameraman asked her to move just a little closer to the protesters . With the lady closer , the cameraman could capture upon his film not only her and the protesters , but a statue of the Infant Jesus of Prague . The lady bared her teeth to the gums , shouted , and flailed the air with her arms . The protesters  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked their heads backward with each spit-laden word flung from her mouth . The Infant Jesus of Prague just kept his two little fingers up in the air blessing them all . Father Buhl remained in the vestibule over two hours trying to calm the storm raging within his body . The nausea washed over him like waves upon a beach and there were moments when he felt he would be engulfed and swept away in a spinning , dizzy tide . He took deep breaths and braced himself against a rack filled with tracts and paperback books . The city editor assigned me to cover the sit-in. saying , " Jesus , get out there . Priests spend so much time bustin ' people in the ass , we ca n't miss them bustin ' each other . " A short time after I arrived , in fact before I could be seated , Father Buhl stalked into the sanctuary , faced the protesters and began singing : " Would you like to swing on a star ... " The protesters  --  as soon as they had recovered from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing along with him : " But if you do n't care a feather or a fig/You may grow up to be a pig . " Occasionally Father Garibaldi would punctuate the end of the refrain by winking , squinching air through the side of his mouth and pointing his finger at Father Buhl like a pistol . Father Buhl , enraged and red in the face , stalked from the sanctuary as abruptly as he had entered . In the short time it takes an infuriated man to climb a staircase , he was walking to the edge of the choir loft and stepping up on the rail above the heads of the protesters . Some thought he was going to jump . But he pulled the white collar from his neck and flung it down at the protesters . Then came the black coat , falling with a smack next to one of the college girls . The black rabat fell in the aisle . its elastic straps flapping . Those in the sanctuary could see that Father Buhl was muttering something , but no one could hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times the priest appeared to be taking gasps of air , " like he was trying to light a pipe that was n't there . " Father Buhl 's black trousers , belt still in the loops , fell across Father Garibaldi 's head and shoulders with one cuff dangling below his chin . As Father Buhl stepped down from the rail , ran down the stairs , and  --  puffing for breath  --  stalked up the aisle of the church , he was clad in a white undershirt by BVD , white jockey shorts by Fruit of the Loom , black over-the-calf socks by Supp-hose ( " For legs of all ages , " the ad said ) , and black eight-eyelet oxfords by Crosby Square ( " Fine Shoemakers Since 1867 " ) . The over-the-calf socks pumped rapidly back down the aisle of the church . They zigged and cut the air like the tense black legs of an attacking crow as Father Buhl flailed the protesters with a broom . Again the spindly , black-clad legs pumped up the aisle . They returned , pumped beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they pulled broom straw from their hair  --  and swearing protesters , pumped up the stairs , and stepped onto the choir-loft rail again . These over-the-calf socks by Supp-hose had a tendency to catch the eye , suspended as they were beneath the white underwear . And it was the black socks ( " For legs of all ages " ) that Father Garibaldi recalled seeing from the corner of his eye , above and behind him , when the altar wine began splattering upon his head . Father Buhl was blushing the wine outward , as one dampens the coals in the outdoor barbecue . The priest worked so hard up there running back and forth on the ledge and sloshing that I recall wondering at the time how he avoided falling off . Father Buhl had another memory . " Have you ever seen birds in a rainstorm ? " in asked me . " They flutter and turn their backs to thr driving rain . And sometimes one will tuck his heat under his wing and occasionally pull it out ant turn toward the raining heavens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little queers reminder me of down there when I douched them with th , wine . " When Father Buhl reached the bottom of th choir-loft staircase , the black , grim-faced man wie the goatee was waiting . The black man grabbe. the priest by the shoulders and swung him into th reading-material rack . Tracts and books fell to th floor . The black man wore an Egyptian ring on hi right hand , He made a fist and slammed the littl image of King Khafre into Father Buhl 's moutl The priest careened across the vestibule , his shot skittering on the marble floor and kicking into th air scattered tracts on the " Seven Deadly Sins " an " Getting to Know Jesus Our Brother . " The other protesters persuaded the sullen Mae man to return to the sanctuary . Father Buhl lay on the marble floor , - taking dee breaths and asking bystanders to please leave hi alone . He continued to wave the bystanders ask as he got up , brushed off his underwear , and mm his way toward the rectory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and soaked into tl white undershirt by BVD and the white jock shorts by Fruit of the Loom . ISS KATIE WAS WATCHING from the rectory wi dow when Father Buhl stumbled from t church . She slid from room to room frantical trying to find his bathrobe . Finally she grabbed a cassock and ran back to the window to look agai " He misjudged the hedge and fell over it , " s told me in a later interview . " He must have bang his knee on the sidewalk something frightful 1 cause he was limping so as he came in . And the poor thing had blood on his chin and underwear . I most nearly cried . " She had stood there holding the cassock open wide as if she planned to trap him like a prodigal parakeet . " He stepped into his cassock and he did n't hardly say much of a thing to me , just Well , Miss Katie . I guess I wo n't be no monsignor now . ' " At this point in our interview at St. Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashtray . He stood and looked out of the window for the remainder of the time I was there . Mostly his hands staved behind his back , the back of the right held firmly within the curled palm of the left . Occasionally he flexed his fingers as an arthritic. does . " I vomited , " he said . " I felt so damn sick , and so god-awful tired . After lying down on the bed  --  I was face down  --  I can recall feeling the cuff of my cassock against my forehead . After vomiting I bad wiped my mouth with my sleeve and it was wet . I kept thinking I should move my arm before I fell asleep . But I never did . " I had a curious dream . You know how an old man will dream when things are bad . " He turned to me and winked . II was nut his usual vigorous wink . His eyelid did not fully close . He turned back to face the window . " When I was a kid this dago family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetables . They had an International Harvester truck  --  not a terribly old truck , but not a new one either  --  and it was black with red fenders . The father and mother and all the kids would be on the truck , kids swinging off the back and usually the mother driv. ing . Both the father and mother were big , sloppy , fat people . She wore one of those print dresses and his khaki trousers were always slung below his big belly by a brown belt that had little cracks running lengthwise . " He paused and flexed his fingers as if he w ere trying to get the blood to circulate . " I hated those little wops . Toys would be missing in the neighborhood and we knew they took them . But they were so damn happy all the time . I guess people like that just do n't know any better . Their father would just stop the truck right in the middle of the street and play with them . I thought they were disgusting people . The father would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mop the sweat from his face . And I 'd see the kids slip the handkerchief from his pocket and run . Fled just catch ' em and get it back . No whipping . No punishment . " He raised his arms and slapped his sides . " Well , anyway . I was going to tell you about the iream . I was somewhere in Italy , I suppose near , este ' Gandolfo . The clouds were blowing in from he sea . That same truck  --  the International Har'ester with the red fenders  --  drove up . T hope you inderstand now that this was just a crazy dream . am not a man given to blasphemous thoughts . " After I assured him that I put no stock in dreams , he continued , again with his hands behind his back . " The Pope got out of the truck and he was the biggest dago you ever saw . It was rather funny  --  and I hope you do n't think me disrespectful . But there he was  --  the Pope , the Vicar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat belly . And I swear to God he pulled a red bandanna from his back pocket and mopped his face . Now is n't that strange that I should dream such truck as that ? " I assured him I thought it strange . " The Pope was carrying a fish , a yellow perch / believe . His fingers were hooked inside the fish 's lower lip and water was dripping from the fish 's tail . It seemed so real , that tail flipping and water dripping down to make a little dotted line wherever His Holiness walked . " Father Buhl , still keeping his back to me , curled his arm and curled his fingers to show me how the fish was carried . He moved the curled arm in a figure eight pattern at his side and brought the index finger of the other hand over to indicate the dripping water . " I 'm not sure if they have perch in the Italian lakes . But in the dream it was a perch . " He returned to the parade rest position and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see boys playing Sunday afternoon baseball on the St. Joseph 's playground . " Father Garibaldi was there , in the dream with the Pope . He had his cassock on , pressed and neat and snug on his firm shoulders . Oh , he was a hand . some priest . Too bad . Too bad about the little queer . Too damn bad . " It appeared from the back that Father Buhl was shaking his head . " You understand , of course , how things get had and an old man dreams . " As he continued his story he kept his hands behind but touched his forehead to the windowpane . In the course of our conversation he rubbed his forehead from side to side , allowing the cool pane to follow the curve of his brow . " We were all walking away from the International Harvester , toward a table underneath a tree in the distance . As we walked along everyone seemed rather jolly and Father Garibaldi urged me to sneak the red bandanna from the Pope 's back pocket . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall stirring in my sleep at that point and outside I could hear people talking loudly . Somehow I knew it was the police and for the first time all day I was afraid . It was not so much being afraid of the police , what they would do to me . But just dreading all the humiliation and seeing the Church ridiculed so . " The glass pane was steamed from the rubbing of Father Buhl 's forehead . Small droplets of water began to form on the pane and run down to the windowsill . " His Holiness caught me and tugged the bandanna out of my hand and threw his head back and laughed the biggest dago laugh I ever beard . He laughed straight up at the sky , and said , ' I think together , Father Buhl , we understand why Jesus loved the little ones so . ' " Outside the baseball game had developed into a heated contest . Boys were yelling . At times Father Buhl 's voice sank so low I could not hear him over the shouting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have seen the table under the tree . So much food . The Pope said to me , ' Come . my son , we 'll show you how well we Italians eat . The food is from the length and breadth of our country . Being Pope , you see , I get all kinds of junk sent to me . ' And the Holy Father went on and on like that . His big beefy arm was locked around my waist . I can still see that table so well , little dishes and jars of pimentos , mushrooms  --  the kind fixed up yellow in juice  --  breadsticks , boiled eggs cut in quarters , big pitted olives stuffed red , sausages , and there was a cheese pie with a cracked , yellow crust . " As Father Buhl described the food his hands broke from each other and waved at his side . It was unusual to see a man gesture and talk and yet keep his back to you . He held his arms high in the air . " The Holy Father held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son , very ecumenical : Jewish-style artichokes . ' Then the Pope held up a wine flask and said , ' It 's called Est ! Est ! ! Est ! ! ! Let me tell you why . ' And he told a funny story about a cardinal drinking himself to death at the wineshop in Montefiascone where he first encountered this wine . I ca n't recall the story very well , but I do remember the Holy Father saying , ' The cardinal was thus led to his death by a German priest named Johann Fugger .. My son . always beware of anyone with a name like Fugger . ' And he threw his head back for another one of those dago laughs . " His fingers distended , Father Buhl circumscribed big arcs with his hands . " And the cheese . It was piled in mounds and the Pope explained the origin of each type . There were hunks of Parmigiana Reggiano that really looked like shattered pieces of gold . They were freshly cut  --  or , I guess , broken  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like pigs and fat boys and melons . Father Garibaldi cut open a ham and told me , ' It 's salt-cured from Langhirano . ' And later , after eating , we had coffee  --  the kind you get in the Piazza San Marco at Venice  --  and orange ices . I believe the Italians call them granite . " Father Buhl 's hands were behind him again , one cradled inside the other . He rubbed his forehead on the windowpane .. " They asked me to sing . Father Garibaldi asked . Goddamn he 's not all that had . He told them I had a good voice . The damn , dumb dago . Said it was a joy to serve under a singing pastor . Said no priest had sung so well since Bing Crosby as O'Malley . Said he would drink my Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi with a meat dinner . It was so good to be there in that place . When I sang all of the old songs the Pope held his massive hands high over his head as he clapped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the clouds blew in from the sea . And it seemed as if we were under that tree near Castel Gandolfo , there eating and drinking with the Holy Father for days and days . But I suppose we all come bac to ' face the music ' as they say , back to this den o ugliness and sin , back to little fairy priests and foil songs and protesters . " When he turned to me there was a smile I hal not seen before . " Even back to old pastors who misbehave. thank you for having the stomach to hear me out . Miss Katie slid her feet beside me down the hal and let me out with scarcely a grunt , turning t walk away from the door even before she closed it Father Buhl saluted me as I passed beneath hi window . T HE BASEBALL GAME HAD ENDED but three of th players remained . They were talking quietl ? As I passed . a truck pulled to the curb and one c the baseball players , an Italian boy , took an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark  --  haire woman . The boy hurried away , holding the cassoc high to avoid the dirt of the baseball diamond . " Angelo , " the driver yelled , " when novena finished get your butt home .
