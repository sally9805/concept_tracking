Private colleges have been pleading poverty in recent years-most eloquently in fund-raising letters mailed out to alumni . Some of the larger , research-oriented universities like Harvard , Columbia , Stanford and Chicago have reason to complain ; lately their federal research grants , which represent much of their funding , have been drastically cut . But the case for most of the smaller colleges may well have been overdramatized . Last week the Association of American Colleges , which represents 886 of the smaller private institutions , reported that most of these schools are financially solvent and academically strong-perhaps even stronger than ever . <P> Staying Power . The report , prepared by Howard R. Bowen , former president of California 's Claremont Graduate School , and W. John Minter , an educational consultant , was based on a survey of 100 private colleges from 1969 into early 1975 . Despite the depressed economy , the report noted that no major private colleges or universities have failed . Although about one-fourth of those surveyed are on shaky financial ground , the total assets of the 100 schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18% . Income from private gifts went up 34% ; government grants showed a 65% increase . <P> Academically , too , the schools have been making progress . In the past five years , the number of new or expanded on-campus programs-women 's studies , career counseling and intercollegiate athletics , for example-far exceeds the number reduced in scope or dropped entirely . Finally , contrary to the widely held belief that enrollment at private colleges has been steadily declining , the total enrollment in the schools surveyed has actually risen 8% since 1969. * <P> These statistics offer little solace to those schools that are financially strapped ; they still need generous support from alumni , business and government . But in general , the report concludes , private colleges have " enormous staying power . They are still a viable and sturdy part of the American system of higher education . " <P> <P> * The Department of Health , Education and Welfare reported last week that total college enrollment this fall reached 11,128,000 , a jump of 8.8% over last year and the largest increase since 1965. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
