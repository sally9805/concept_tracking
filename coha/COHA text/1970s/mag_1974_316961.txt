Tapes of White House conversations made public for the first time at the Watergate cover-up trial last week , as well as portions of other conversations edited out of earlier White House transcripts , show that Richard Nixon planned and participated in cover-up acts almost from the beginning , then grew increasingly suspicious of his aides as he sought frantically to protect himself . Some excerpts : <P> GRANTING PARDONS <P> April 14 , 1973 . President Nixon , H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman . <P> P. You get them full pardons . That 's what they have to have , John ...

I mean , after all , the man 's wife is dead , was killed ; he 's got one child that has - <P> C. Brain damage from an automobile accident . <P> P. We 'll build , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business . We 'll have William Buckley write a column and say , you know , that he , that he should have clemency , if you 've given 18 years of service. * <P> PAYING HUSH MONEY <P> April 14 , 1973 . Nixon meets with Ehrlichman . <P> P. They 've got ta have a straight damn line that of course we raised money . Be very honest about it . But , uh , we raised money for a purpose that we thought was perfectly proper . <P> E. Um hum . Uh hum . <P> P. But we did n't want to shut ' em up . These men were guilty ... We just did n't , we did n't want ' em to talk to the press . <P> E. Yeah , yeah , <P> P. That 's perfectly legitimate , is n't it ? Or is it ? Legitimate not to want them to talk to the press . <P> E. I think it is . I , uh , I , I do n't have a perfect understanding of the , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the subject was brought up again , Ehrlichman added : " Before I get too far out on that , uh , I want to talk to an attorney .

Nixon and Ehrlichman discuss John Dean 's meeting with Nixon on March 21,1973 , in which Dean warned of " a cancer growing on the presidency " and Nixon approved paying money to silence Hunt . Dean is talking to the prosecutors . <P> P. Do n't know what the son of a bitch is going to say ... He 's obviously very upset . He 's just lashing out . Goddammit ... I 'm at a loss ... that goddam Dean . <P> E. I think you can very truthfully and logically and properly say that ... <P> P. I was really trying to probe his thought process . I went down every road we possibly could ... <P> E. Exactly right . You see , you 're the one who ... said ... " Send that man to Camp David ... and let 's get it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> P.

Obviously , neither one of us wants to do anything to harm you in any way ; we want to avoid harming you ... I think it 's entirely conceivable that if Dean is totally out of control and if matters are not handled adroitly that you could get a resolution of impeachment ... <P> P. That 's right .
