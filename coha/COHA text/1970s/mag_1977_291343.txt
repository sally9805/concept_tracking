Next door to the White House , in the stately old Executive Office Building , a nine-man ad hoc team held its first meeting last week . In Washington , task forces and special committees bloom and die like cherryblossoms - and often make about as much impact on policy-but this group is different . Its boss is James Schlesinger , 48 , he of the omnivorous intellect and encyclopedic rsum , the man chosen by Jimmy Carter to take charge of the nation 's energy problems . The group 's goal : to produce a 50-page document outlining , as the President put it in last week 's press conference , " a comprehensive , long-range energy policy " in just over two months . Deadline : April 20 . <P> " I offer no miracle cure , " says Schlesinger . To the contrary , practically all of the elements likely to turn up in the new plan have been discussed-though , alas , not acted on-for years . Schlesinger 's group already has general principles sketched out . It is clear that the policy will focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cs " : conservation and coal . First , tough conservation measures must be taken so that the nation can buy time to develop well-considered alternatives to oil and gas as fuels . Next , a determined effort must be made to get many power plants to switch to coal , so that the U.S. can reduce its dependence on imported oil . <P> The plan will doubtless provide incentives to encourage domestic oil and gas companies to push production . But it also will include safeguards against extravagant profits-possibly a " windfall profits tax " on energy companies that are allowed to raise prices . Finally , it seems sure that the program will not relax tough environmental controls on energy use . David Freeman , 51 , Schlesinger 's senior aide , puts the point in a gloriously mixed metaphor : " We start out with the cornerstone of our energy policy cut from environmental cloth . " <P> Tall Order . It is a dizzyingly tall order indeed , but Jim Schlesinger thrives on rising to the highest occasions . A Harvard economics Ph.D. , he has served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the Office of Management and Budget , chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission , director of the CIA and Secretary of Defense . He gets to the office by 7 a.m. , rarely departs before 9:30 at night , and rides his staff hard , sometimes demanding an answer minutes after he has assigned a complex question . The energy-plan team works twelve-hour days and fully expects to put in weekends . Says one staffer : " Every day here seems like a week . " <P> Aide Freeman , overseer of the respected 1974 Ford Foundation energy study A Time to Choose , has overnight become a Washington force in his own right . A few weeks ago , he was an obscure member of Carter 's transition team ; now he occupies a grand office with a fireplace overlooking the presidential swimming pool . He promises a first-class report : " We 're not going to settle for nickel-and-diming . " Most other task-force members are keen-minded generalists in the Schlesinger mold , more schooled in problem solving than in energy .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
