Mao Tse-tung and Richard Nixon have committed themselves to paper on the subject of how to conduct a relationship between old adversaries . Chairman Mao 's writings are the bigger seller , but Nixon 's Six Crises has its historical value . Two examples : <P> NIXON 1960 , on Red China 's admission to the U.N. : In expressing my strong opposition , I pointed out that the issue was n't whether Red China had one vote in the Assembly or even the veto power . What was really at stake was that admitting Red China to the United Nations would be a mockery of the provision of the charter which limits its membership to " peace-loving nations . " And what was most disturbing was that it would give respectability to the Communist regime , which would immensely increase its power and prestige in Asia and probably irreparably weaken the non-Communist governments in that area . <P> MAO 1945 , on negotiations with the Chinese Nationalists . Communist officials are being urged to read these words as an explanation of Peking 's new attitude toward Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must be prepared to follow twists and turns and not try to get things on the cheap . It must not be imagined that one fine morning all the reactionaries will go down on their knees of their own accord . How to give " tit-for-tat " depends upon the situation . Sometimes , not going to negotiations is tit-for-tat , and sometimes , going to negotiations is also tit-for-tat . We were right not to go before and also right to go this time .
