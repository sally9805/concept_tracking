Nation <P> Saving Sence of Paranioa <P> The DC-10 crash proves the need for constant vigilance <P> Even before the last bodies had been found , the detective story began . Federal investigators started poking through the smoldering wreckage of the DC-10 in the flame-seared field near Chicago 's O'Hare Airport , collecting pieces of metal that colleagues later examined under electron microscopes . Their findings last week were enough to chill the most seasoned air traveler : the key elements that destroyed American Airlines Flight 191 and killed 274 people appeared to be a bolt 3 in. long and ? in. in diameter , and a cracked metal plate . Both were parts of the pylon assembly under the left wing that held one of the plane 's three engines . <P> The very contrast between the small parts and the ghastly consequences of their failure in the worst U.S. air disaster would have been troubling enough . But other events stemming from their discovery were also unsettling . The Federal Aviation Administration , the governing body of U.S. flight , quickly ordered inspections of all 138 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 , and Lorin Schluter , 39 , two conscientious United Airlines mechanics , found metal filings as fine as dust on one DC-10 in Chicago . Suspicious , they did the natural thing : they shook the pylon . It was loose . The two men discovered 27 fasteners that held together part of the pylon were missing or sheared . They also found that the spar web , a key pylon support , was cracked . Gigliotti told the press , " Eventually , that pylon would have separated from the plane . " <P> Two hours after learning of that discovery , the FAA grounded all DC-10s , the first time it had ever done so to a fleet of jetliners . The move immobilized 12% of the capacity of U.S. passenger planes and substantially disrupted air travel . By week 's end ominous faults of various kinds - cracked plates , loose bolts-had turned up in the pylons of 36 of the inspected aircraft . After repair , one got back into the air , with FAA permission , joining 102 found to have no defects . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board investigating the American crash , said that he thought the planes should have been kept in hangars until the cause of the disaster had been more fully determined . Would he fly on a DC-10 as a passenger ? Answered Hogue : " No , I would not . " <P> The probe into the American crash seems certain to lead to a broader and deeper investigation , going all the way back to the initial design of the DC-10 by McDonnell Douglas Corp . and its certification by the FAA . The Government 's recommendations about the DC-10 will largely depend on what the NTSB 's crash detectives eventually find to be the " probable cause " of Flight 191 's crash . The accident left no survivors to interview , and the cockpit voice recorder disclosed only two sounds after the routine checklist readings : an unexplained thud and the single word " Damn ! " shouted by the pilot or copilot , apparently just as the engine tore away from the wing .               @ @ @ @ @ @
