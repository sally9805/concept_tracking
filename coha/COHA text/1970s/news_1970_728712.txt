txt A stately square dance in the Senate has broken up into a rock session with each dancer doing his own thing . The cohesion has gone out of the Cambodian debate . Its collapse into a medley of confused and sometimes almost zany happenings , with tables being turned and returned , would be laughable were it not for the serious reasons behind it . The Nixon administration has once again frustrated its leading critics in the matter of the Vietnam war . Whether it has genuinely outmaneuvered them remains , as this is written , to be seen . But a formidable and promising drive by the Senate doves to administer a strong rebuke to the President for going into Cambodia without the permission of Congress has been blunted . Just as success seemed to be in their grasp it began to melt away . U.S. forces withdrawn The chief reason for the upset seemed to lie in the nature of the doves ' attack . It was based on a number of assumptions which flared with emotional and ideological alarm during the days of shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public in saying it was only a raid and would be over in two months ; that even if Mr. Nixon wanted to withdraw he would be sucked into an escalating Indo-Chinese war ; that he would have to defend the Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh ; that the net result would prolong the war and interrupt the withdrawal of American troops . Instead , American ground forces seem to be coming out on schedule . There is no sign of a commitment to defend Lon Nol . Enlargement of the war appears to be temporary . Withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam is scheduled to continue as announced . In a word , the doves considered that they had reason for mistrusting both the President 's motives and his ability to end the Cambodian affair as he said he would . The President has responded by doing what he said he would do . Give or take some latitude for leaving American air power in Cambodia and permitting it to stretch its technical assignment to hit supply routes , Mr. Nixon has supported his credibility . Repeal initiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones in front of the big toes of the advancing Cooper-Church-Fulbright forces , the parliamentary situation deteriorated . The Republicans maneuvered to repeal the Gulf of Tonkin resolution which the Fulbright group counted upon as their chief maneuver to stage a major debate . Democratic leader Mike Mansfield of Montana resorted to saying the Tonkin Gulf resolution could be repealed twice to give Sen. J. W. Fulbright his debate . Meanwhile , resolutions and counterresolutions came with bewildering speed to muddy the basic meaning and effectiveness of the Cooper-Church resolution to ban future invasions of Cambodia  --  a resolution that would n't be passed by the House anyhow . Its value as a " symbolic " rebuke to the White House diminished . The outcome could alter this picture somewhat , but any major change in the trend seems unlikely at present writing . Mr. Nixon once again picks up a goodly number of marbles . Whether he can sustain his position for the long run will doubtless hinge on facts and events rather than arguments and suspicions regard . ing the American withdrawal from Southeast Asia .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
