Down the disassembly line flows an unending stream of chickens , drumsticks pointing straight up , as white-aproned workers cut and dismember . <P> Feathers , beaks , combs and claws - nonedible elements-fall into a trough that flushes the refuse to a rendering plant across the street . The refuse is then converted into chicken feed that is recycled into the next generation of broilers , who become unwitting cannibals . This super-streamlined operation , which uses everything from the chicken but the cluck , is run by Stratford of Texas Inc. , a company less than four years old . Chief Executive Officer Robert Gow formed it in order to apply the computerized principles of industrial engineering to the task of pleasing a nation of hungry consumers . <P> Gow is a lanky , talkative New Englander who resigned as president of a successful offshore-oil-drilling business because he thought that organized agriculture is the new frontier of business . " The day when agriculture is called upon to save the dollar is already here , " he says . " Just as Japan may be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can , the U.S. can produce broilers and beef more cheaply and ship them all over the world . " Thus far , Stratford 's three basic operational areas are cattle , chickens and potted plants , and Gow organizes each division down to the last moo , cluck and root . Centralized production is one principle : the cattle operation is typical . Stratford 's three yards are concentrated within a 30-mile radius , in keeping with Gow 's belief in concentrated locations , and they feed a total of 150,000 head . ( By December Gow plans to expand to 250,000 . ) The yards fatten a 650-lb. steer at the rate of 3.1 lbs . per day . Five months and some 490 lbs . later , the steer is shipped off to a packer . " It 's a big operation , " Gow says . " We have vets and nutritionists ; the cattle are checked twice a day . We have a good drainage system , which means our cattle do n't have to stand in mud . It 's a hotel for cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own feeds , which are fertilized by manure from its own cattle . A division of the company enriches waste rice hulls with nitrogen for feed . To speed up digestion of grain in a cow 's four stomach cavities , Stratford converts corn and milo into flakes . All these cost-shaving techniques mean that Stratford can fatten cattle at 30 to 40 per pound below the national average . The chicken branch , centered near Tenaha , Texas , and the floriculture operation , in Apopka , Fla. , produce along comparably canny lines . <P> Stratford 's progress is reflected in its figures : last year profits were $3,400,000 . The company 's revenues rose from $27.8 million in 1969 to $78.8 million in 1972 . The year 1971 , however , was bad : though sales rose to $60.3 million , from $37.5 million in 1970 , the company showed a loss of $4,000,000 . Gow explains that although only a small fraction of Stratford 's income stems from oil , a blowout in one of its natural gas wells cost the company $6,000,000 . The company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eight times earnings , which is roughly on a par with companies like Ford and Bethlehem Steel .
