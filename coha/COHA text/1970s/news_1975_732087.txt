txt It 's 7 a. m . Richard %V . Red DeRobertis , a lanky , quiet man from South Holland , dons his green uniform and calmly walks unarmed thru the gate of the aging concrete block wall of the Pontiac Correctional Center ? one of Illinois ' three maximum security prisons . " I 'm a corrections officer , " he tells a reporter . " That guy on the wall is a guard . " Changing the titles of some guards to " correction officers " is merely one of the reforms which the Illinois prison system is adopting . In another name change , prisoners are now " residents . " In the prison yard a hundred " residents " in groups of 20 or so , idly loll around , lift weights , or shoot basketballs . Red is alone in the center of the football-field-size yard  --  the only guard . IIE IS UNARMED because it those hundred men decided to riot they could easily take away his gun and use It . Instead of a gun or billy club , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If a riot broke out , I 'd head for the nearest exit , " he says almost matter-of-factly . " Or the towers . The tower guards are armed . A few well-placed shots . . . " All of Illinois ' nearly 1,700 prison guards have the same instructions : In case of trouble , retreat to safety and summon reinforcements . But prison guards do n't like to think about riots . Like the incident last May 7 in which four guards were taken hostage in the tough segregation ward . Guard morale was given a tremendous boost tho when the warden told the inmates to let the hostages go or he would cleatt4 out the place with a riot squad . They were meekly released . MOST OF DeROBERTIS ' day Is spent ' thinking about nothing in particular as he idly watches Pontiac 's 1,147 prisoners wander slowly thru their daily routines . He watches them get up in the morning , shower every other day , eat lunch called " standing a feed " by the guards , read . books , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells aimlessly dreaming about the outside ? " the street " or " the bricks . " " Standing the feed is the most boring detail . All you do is stand there and watch guys eat , " DeRobertis says , as he starts on his second pack of cigarets . To the outsider , prison routine is incredibly slow and monotonous , as boring for the guards as for the men they watch . Except for occasional riots , brawls , or beatings , it is the same routine , day after day , week after week , month after month .. . " THE PRISONERS come and go , but the guards are there year after year , " said Jess Maghan , superintendent of Illinois ' year-old Department of Corrections Training Academy at St. Xavier College on Chicago 's far South Side . " Sometimes the officers become more institutionalized than the prisoners . " Maghan and DeRobertis are the type of men State Corrections Director Allyn R. Sielaff , a reformer , is trying to bring into his department to upgrade the prison system . DeRobertis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a desire to help and the idealism to believe he can . lIe is the product of two successive administrations in Springfield which have hired bright young men with a compasson for the felons they supervise and a desire to carry the reforms further . Those reforms still have , a long way to go , corrections officials admit . " MANY OF OUR problems In the 1960s and early 1070s were the result of our inability to provide a better quality guard , " said one official . " The guards were underpaid and undereducated  --  and still are  --  but that was only part of the problem . " Many of our guards came from rural backgrounds , but most of our prisoners were from the cities . They could n't understand each other . " Maghan arranged to have some downstate guards tour the Cabrini Green Project so they could finally see what they had heard prisoners talking about for years . In 1974 the . University of Chicago 's Center for Criminal Studies completed a report of Illinois ' prison guards based in part on interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It painted a bleak picture . BEING A PRISON guard is not only a " dead end " with little chance for advancement , it said , but guards serve as " convenient scapegoats for the lack of success that has attended most efforts at rehabilitation . " Professionals in the corrections business often view inmates with greater sympathy than they show toward the men guarding them . Until recently the turnover rate among guards was astronomical one-third a year , and many of the men who stayed did so because they needed to moonlight to make ends meet or had trouble keeping other jobs . The pay is still not the greatest , altho it has been steadily increasing , De ' Robertis makes only about ** a year . oven the he has a college degree and a year on the job . Nevertheless , that 's $3 , - 000 more than he would have made as a guard in 1970 . Sielaff also has begun a program to recruit more black guards . Pontiac 's population is 80 per cent black , but most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training at Maghan 's academy on the St. Xavier Campus , about as far from a prison atmosphere as a person can get . Even veteran guards are required to take annual refresher courses . New recruits must complete five to eight weeks of training , which includes courses on homosexuality a problem in all prisons , legal rights of inmates , narcotics , and human relations . Maghan is still wrestling with attrition , the . One study showed about half of the academy graduates did n't even complete their six-month probationary period at Stateville . He hopes the training program will better prepare recruits for what they will face behind the walls . Unfortunately , many Illinois prisons are seriously understaffed Pontiac needs 50 to 75 men , and new guards usually are tossed to the lions without any help in adjusting to life behind the walls . DeIdOBERTIS SAYS HE made the difficult adjustment from civilian life to prison guard " by keeping my mouth shut and watching what the other guards did . " He can open his mouth , the , when he has to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recalls , whelk three prisoners , armed with iron pipes , leaped from a gangway and began beat : ing one of the inmates he was escorting , He put an end to the incident by simply shouting : " Hey , cut it out ! " As a corrections officer he is supposed to minister to the individual needs of the prisoners as well as guard them . He is expected to obtain for prisoners such things as toilet paper and pencils , and listen to their complaints . " I 'VE HAD GUYS want to duke it out with me , " he says , as he walks along a celiblock . " But I 've backed off . We 're here to keep the peace , not magnify the problem . " You hate to see a good resident ripped off , " he says , pointing to an unoccupied cell he is about to lock to prevent the prisoner 's meager personal belongings from being stolen . " We try to patrol the galleries to prevent pilferage when the residents are out on work details or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among thieves does n't apply . " DeRobertis strolls leisurely along a line of cells , and one prisoner asks for ' help in getting permission to make a telephone call home . He arranges it . IT 'S NOT EXACTLY heavy Intellectual stuff for a 28-year-old Thornridge High School graduate who earned his bachelor 's degree in sociology at Illinois State Univeristy in Normal after a stint in the Marines in Viet Nam . But he likes the work . He thinks the pay Is reasonable and that he is making a contribution to society , which is why he is contemplating a career In corrections . " I 'd like to see these changes which break down the frustrations , " he says . " I can see myself as an agent for change for the better . " It has to change , " ho says as he takes a sweeping look at the grey Walls . " It ca n't continue to exist in its present state , " TO HELP EFFECT that change , De . Robertis , who originally took the job as a guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taking graduate courses in corrections . He spends two hours driving to Sangamon State University two nights each week to attend class , To some officials in the prison system , that Is an ominous sign . " The better educated a man le , the harder it is for us to keep him , " one said . " He becomes frustrated faster and quits , "
