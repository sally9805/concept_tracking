In almost every issue , Playboy magazine has run a full-page house ad asking the slightly rhetorical question : " What Sort of Man Reads Playboy ! " The answer assures advertisers that the Playboy reader , in his quest for the good life , spares no expense . In a way , the same has been true of Playboy Enterprises , Inc. , the haphazard corporate empire spawned by the magazine that Hugh M. Hefner founded with several hundred borrowed dollars in 1953 . Over the years , , movie , record and book publishing businesses and a second magazine , OUI , which was launched three years ago to compete with Bob Guccione 's Penthouse . Financially speaking , however , the good life has of late proved to be elusive for PEI : on sales of $204 million in the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1974 , the company suffered a drop in profits of nearly 50% , to $5.9 million . Recently ended fiscal 1975 was certainly worse . Though results for the full year have not yet been tabulated , the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 22-year history , for the middle two quarters . <P> Ax Man . Inflation and recession are two reasons for the slump : the company 's printing and paper costs have skyrocketed , and guests are spending less at the hotels and clubs . But the troubles also reflect Hefner 's habit of plunging into new ventures without doing any in-depth advance planning , then losing interest but still insisting on making all the big decisions himself . As a result , PEI is saddled with businesses ranging from modeling agencies and limousine services to bar trinkets , for which it is only now beginning to develop a coherent marketing strategy . Recognizing that the operation must be trimmed down and reorganized , Hefner has now called in Victor Lownes , 47 , a longtime crony and PEI 's second largest stockholder . Officially , Lownes is director of Playboy Leisure Activities , a new division that includes the hotels and clubs , where losses have been glaring ; unofficially , he is Hefner 's ax man . <P> Lownes , a graduate of the University of Chicago , met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea for the Playboy clubs . Personally , he is an ultra-Playboy whose life-style even Hefner envies . As head of PEI 's highly profitable club operations in England , Lownes has been living in a 42-room mansion near London and riding to work in a chauffeured Rolls-Royce . He skis in the Alps and cruises in the Mediterranean , often in the company of more than one beautiful woman . To support himself in this opulence , Lownes draws not only on his $113,800 Playboy salary , but also on private wealth that he has accumulated by dealing in modern art and starting a hamburger chain in England . <P>
