Despite widespread predictions of a further slowdown in the economy , companies that advertise on television are betting that consumers will still have a lot of money to spend in the months ahead . <P> All three networks report that their prime advertising time for the fall season is more than 90% sold and , according to the weekly Broadcasting , ad time is extensively sold into next year as well . <P> Prices have been especially high for the fall , and the discounts that network salesmen traditionally proffer to sweeten the deals have been small . One minute of commercial time on CBS 's All in the Family had a record list price of $128,000 ; a minute on NBC 's Sanford &; Son commanded as high as $90,000 ; and a minute on ABC 's Marcus Welby , M.D. cost $76,000 . Total prime-time advertising sales so far in 1973 are running 15% ahead of last year . Says Mike Weinblatt , NBC-TV vice president of sales , the record bookings are a " vote of confidence " in the economy .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
