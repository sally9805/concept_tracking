It is a nightmare that has nagged scientists since the dawn of nuclear power . A cooling-system pipe ruptures . The temperature of the nuclear reactor 's core fuel shoots up , melting its zircaloy shielding . Finally the heat becomes so intense that the entire domed building disintegrates , leaking out a cloud of radioactive fallout that kills tens of thousands of people . <P> That gloomy scenario is , happily , still no more than hypothetical . But could such a blowdown , as scientists call it , really occur ? Most officials say the risk is infinitesimally small . Even if a loss of coolant did occur , the reactor 's back-up emergency core cooling system would presumably swing into action . Critics remain unpersuaded . They point out that there has never been a real test of a core cooling system in the 27 years of atomic power . <P> Last week , near snow-swept Mud Lake , Idaho , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission undertook to allay fears . It staged a nuclear accident in miniature , deliberately sabotaging a small test reactor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avert a blowdown . <P> The $10 million exercise was officially dubbed a Loss of Fluid test ( LOFT ) . It was held in the Department of Energy 's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory . As some 200 scientists and technicians paced anxiously , the countdown began . On signal , two blowdown pipe valves snapped open , simulating a rupture . In a flash , reactor cooling fluid escaped . As the core 's temperature soared , the secondary cooling system also failed , again according to plan . Then after only 17 seconds , the third system 's coolant began pouring hundreds of gallons of water on the hot core . Its temperature , which had jumped to 516 C ( 960 F ) , still far short of zir-caloy 's melting point , soon settled back to 149 C ( 300 F ) . Exclaimed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 's Thomas Morley : " I pronounce this experiment a success ! " Then off he went for a victory party of pizza and beer . <P> Antinuke forces thought such celebrating was premature . Physicist Henry Kendall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LOFT reactor has less than 2% of the output of a typical atomic plant . Said his colleague Robert Pollard : " It 's like using a kite to prove a moon rocket will work . " But LOFT scientists rejected that argument . Said one : " It is n't necessary to crash 747s against buildings to test their safety . " One thing was indisputable : the emergency core cooling system did work . Just to make sure that it does the job under different conditions , the Commission will stage about 20 more LOFT tests through the 1980s.
