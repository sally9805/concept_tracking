SPANDAU : THE SECRET DIARIES by ALBERT SPEER 463 pages . Macmillan . $13.95 . <P> All the good writers of confessions , from Augustine onwards , are still a little in love with their sins . <P> - Anatole France <P> If any reader doubts the wisdom of France 's aperu let him examine these stark entries . Albert Speer , author of the bestseller Inside the Third Reich , has unique credentials for speculation on the nature of evil and culpability . The architect was literally the Master Builder of the Third Reich and Hitler 's Minister of Armaments and War Production . It was in his ministerial capacity that Speer employed some 5 million slave laborers ; it was for that role that he was sentenced at the Nuremberg trials to long imprisonment . <P> The Reich lasted twelve years , the incarceration 20 . That is merely first in a file of ironies . Forbidden to write a formal memoir , Speer scribbles on toilet paper , then smuggles out his work with the help of a Dutch guard who had once served as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captors-who alternate with more lenient Westerners-are as harsh and arbitrary as Reich Marshals . When he steals a cauliflower from the prison vegetable garden , Speer is caught and sentenced to a week of solitary confinement . <P> Spellbound Lover . His fellow prisoners , the great German admirals Raeder and Doenitz , squabble like jealous ensigns ; the disintegrating Rudolph Hess , once Hitler 's deputy , malingers and throws fits to garner pity . Speer , who displayed no discernible sympathy for workers during the ' 30s and ' 40s , grows hungry . He observes : " I often stoop to pick up crumbs of bread that have fallen from the table . For the first time in my life I am discovering what it means not to have enough to eat . " <P> This lack of moral imagination is clearest in the book within the book-a love story of Albert Speer and Adolf Hitler . It is a romance without queerness or pathos . It is simply the reminiscence of an acolyte still spellbound after all these years . " Is n't it understandable that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he writes , early on . Later a guard marks a significant milestone . Speer writes : " Today would be Hitler 's birthday . How many birthdays I spent with Hitler in the Berlin chancellery , with delegations paying homage to him , with grandiose parades ! " He recalls his mother 's observation of evenings spent at a mountain castle : " Hitler was terribly nice . But such a parvenu world ! " He broods on the fact that he suddenly can not remember the Fhrer 's " engaging traits " : " Have continued to reflect on my relationship to Hitler . The theme of faithlessness . " He recalls the remark of an associate , " made after an evening visit to my studio , that I was Hitler 's unrequited love . " <P> It was not so unrequited . Though Speer recognizes the Fhrer 's monstrous propensities , he is still able to write , wholly without historical remove : " He had the ignorance , the curiosity , the enthusiasm and the temerity of the born dilettante ; and along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
