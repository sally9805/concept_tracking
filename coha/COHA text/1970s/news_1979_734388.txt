txt KNOCK . Ireland  --  This Sunday , the dormant field behind Dominick Byrne 's shop on the only street running through this village of 400 will look like the back lot of a Hollywood studio . It will be taken over by armies of television crews and equipment , recording the comings and goings of an expected quarter million visitors who will throng Knock that day . Byrne , 36 , stood at the back door of his shop recently , looking at his muddy , unused field , and was at turns staggered and overjoyed at the prospect of so many people . " I 'd say you will see a lot of hotels going up around here in the next couple of years , " said Byrne , surveying the tiny village . " I 'm thinking of doing the same thing myself . " I seriously think this village Is going to be another Lourdes . " BYRNE IS ENTHUSIASTIC because on Sunday Pope John Paul 11 is going to make a pilgrimage to Knock to pay respect to the village shrine , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Aug. 21 , 1879 , about 8 o'clock on a rainy evening , 20 villagers , including Byrne 's grandfather , saw a vision on the south gable of the village church . What the villagers saw were the silent , life-size apparitions of the Virgin Mary , her husband , Joseph , and St. John standing and kneeling at an altar with a lamb and a cross over which angels hovered . The figures in the apparition were three-dimensional and moved slightly , bathed in an eerie bright light . Some of the awestruck villagers tried to touch the figures but felt nothing , though they said the ground beneath the figures was bone dry while everything else around them was being drenched with rain . THE APPARITION remained on the church gable for more than 2 ( u hours before disappearing . Since that night , life has never been // Column 1 An Irish ' Lourdes ' prepares for Pope // the same for the Byrne family or any family in Knock . Within days after reports of the apparition , the sick and the aged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their ailments . Many of the early pilgrims , saying they had been cured , left crutches and braces behind after praying at the church gable . Soon people began coming to Knock from the tar reaches of Ireland , then England , the rest of Europe , and even the United States , seeking cures for physical and spiritual ailments . Knock villagers have long since gotten used to the pilgrims . Some of the more fortunate , like Dominick Byrne. have even prospered by them . The Byrne family farm fronted the road right behind the old village church . As the pilgrims grew in numbers , the Byrne family grew less dependent on farming for its livelihood and more dependent on catering to pilgrims ' needs . AT FIRST THEY sold religious items and souvenirs from a wooden hut on the road . Now the family has eight gleaming new shops all in a row along the road , one each run by Byrne , his five brothers , and two sisters . Business has been good , and each year it has gotten better . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a good Sunday as many as 80,000 pilgrims come to Knock . Last year an estimated 1.2 million visited . After the Pope gives the shrine his blessing , the villagers believe Knock will become , like the Lourdes shrine in France , world famous . " I think the Pope 's visit will put this place on the world map forevermore , " Byrne said . The man that the paeple of Knock believe is most responsible tor this sudden good fortune is the village pastot , Msgr . James ! forum , a crinkly eyed Irish priest who could have been cast for the role straight out of Hollywood . " FATHER HORAN said 12 years ago when he took over the parish that , ii it was at all possible , he would bring the Pope here in 111711 to celebrate the lotith anniversary of the apparition , " Byrne said . - So now the Pope is coming . and Father h i ss is rt I .. 1 11 far ai ** villii ? , e cuncertivil 11s , !

" We have built what we have here today a little bit at a time , " said Msgr . Horan , who three years ago built a huge chapel seating 7,000 near the original church . THOUGH KNOCK is sometimes criticized for being overtly commercialized with its jumble of souvernir shops and street side spigots dispensing holy water , Msgr . Horan does not see the criticism as justified . The village is in one of the poorest areas of an economically depressed country , so the business generated by the pilgrims is welcomed , but the shrine and what it represents to the pilgrim is hal is really important , he said . " The papal visit will make the shrine internationally famous , " he said . " A lot more people will be coming here if for nothing else out of simple curiosity . " If they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think they will , because I 've seen this happen thousands of times . " He estimates that beginning next year the village can expect 3 million or more pilgrims annually , a prospect he relishes . THOUGH NOT exactly a local boy , Msgr . Horan was born on a farm about 30 miles from Knock and started visiting the shrine as a small boy , becoming a regular visitor in his youth . " I have always drawn my strength from watching the pilgrims to the shrine , " he said . " I 'm impressed with their piety , devotion , and the way they speak . " It helps me spiritually and personally to see the faith of these people making peace with their God and going away with tears in their eyes .
