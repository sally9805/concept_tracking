The women 's movement may be hurting elsewhere , but it is healthy in the courts . Last week the Supreme Court ruled that no state can deny unemployment benefits to women during the last three months of pregnancy and the six weeks following birth on the " conclusive presumption " that they are all physically unable to work at that time . The decision overturns a portion of a Utah law upheld last February by the state supreme court . Although Mary Ann Turner , 23 , held Kelly Girl temporary jobs during the final months before her son Brian was born , the Utah court ignored such earthly evidence and instead invoked " the Great Creator . " Redress , the court declared , could come only in " the repeal of the biological law of nature . " The Supreme Court decision may well doom 14 other state laws that almost duplicate Utah 's . Especially pleased is Mrs. Turner 's American Civil Liberties Union lawyer , Kathleen W. Peratis . She herself is six months pregnant .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
