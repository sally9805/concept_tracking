The Northeastern and Midwestern sections of the U.S. once glowed with industrial and agricultural riches . In many places today , however , the two regions have the shabby look of an unsuccessful middle age . One reason : the Federal Government , through its spending and tax policies , has been persistently draining wealth from the areas and transferring it to the once neglected but now prospering South and Southwest . <P> In fiscal 1975 , the Great Lakes states gave the Federal Government $62.2 billion in taxes and got back only $43.6 billion- a loss of $18.6 billion . The Mid-Atlantic states of New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania lost $10 billion in the exchange . New England came up $762 million short . By contrast , according to a study in the National Journal , the Southern states got back $11.5 billion more than they paid in taxes . California and the other Pacific states came out ahead by $7 billion , the Mountain states by $3.6 billion . One huge item of difference : federal spending for military bases and defense contracts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal spending policies . They reason that their states can no longer afford to pick up the tab , like patsy older brothers , to fatten other parts of the U.S. The issue is likely to prove a prickly one for the next President , particularly if he hails from a place like Georgia . Sensing its deepening distress if not decay , can anyone fault the Northeast and Midwest for wanting at least to break even ?
