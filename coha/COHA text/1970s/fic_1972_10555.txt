" His better nature prevailed ; besides there was the servantthere . You were brought home the next day none the worse for your adventure and mentally this had had a great effect upon you . Dr. Carlsberg will be so interested when he hears of this . It will bear out his theory . Then came the Night of the Seventh Moon ; we lost each other and you were accosted . The man was masked , you have told us . You believed that he was the was the name he had called me that first time . No one else has ever called me that . There was no doubt who he was . " " That could have come up in your mind afterwards . Or it might even have been the man . In any case on this second occasion his better nature did not prevail . I must tell Dr. Carlsberg about this meeting in the mist . Or perhaps it would be better if you did . " I cried : " You are wrong . You are wrong about every-thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for a while you do go on believing in your dreams . " I did eat a little breakfast and as the physical sickness had passed I got up . I kept thinking of how I had opened the door of that room below and found him , standing there . I could experience the tingling joy the sight of him had given me . " We 'll be married , " he had said . I had replied that people could n't get married just like that . Here they could , he had assured me . Besides he was a count and knew how to get things done . I thought of how we had ridden to the hunting lodge and his impatience and the way he had held me against him and the thrills of excitement he communicated to me . I thought of the simple ceremony with the priest . The marriage lines ! Of course I had them . I had put them away carefully . They were in the top drawer of the dressing table . I remembered putting them with the few pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been my mother 's . There was the box . I brought it out joyfully . I lifted the lid . The jewelry was there , but no marriage lines . I stared at it blankly . No ring . No marriage lines . No Proof . It was beginning to look more and more as though they were right and my romance and my marriage were indeed something deduced by the doctor 's treatment to wipe out the terrible memory of the dreadful thing that had happened to me . I do n't know how I got through the day . When I looked at my face in the mirror I saw another person . My high cheekbones stood out more than ever ; there were faint shadows under my eyes ; but it was the despair which was so startling . The face which looked back at me was touched with a certain hopelessness and that was when I knew that I was beginning to believe them . Dr. Carlsberg came to see me during the morning . He was delighted , he said , that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my improvement . He was sure that what had to be done now was face the truth . He sat beside me . He wanted me to talk , to say anything that came into my mind . I explained to him what I had told use , about the meeting in the mist and the night I had spent at the lodge . He did not attempt to persuade me that I had dreamed that . " If it were possible , " he said , " I should like to obliterate completely from your mind what happened on the Night of the Seventh Moon . That is not possible . The memory is not like a piece of writing in pencil which can be wiped out with an eraser . But it is over . No good can come by preservingthe memory of it . So we must come as near to forgettingas possible . I am glad that you are here . . . away from your home . When you return to England  --  which I hope you will not think of doing for at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has happened . This will help you to push the affair right to the back of your mind . No one will be able to remind you because they do not know what happened . " I said , " Dr. Carlsberg , I ca n't believe you . I ca n't believe my cousins . Something in me tells me that I am married and that it all happened as I am sure it did . " He smiled rather pleased . " You are still in need of that belief . Perhaps it is better for you to cling to it for a while . In due course you will feel strong enough to be without it and the truth will be more important to you than the crutch these dreams are at the moment offering you . " " The time works out perfectly , " I said . " The second day after the Night of the Seventh Moon we were married and on the morning of the fourth day news came to him that his father was in trouble , and he went . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's simply impossible that I was there all that time . " " Yet that is what you will accept in time when you are strong enough to discard your crutch . " " I ca n't believe I imagined him . " " You have attached him to this adventurer you met in the mist . You have told me that your mother often recountedfairy stories and legends of the forest . You came here in a receptive mood , you half-believed in the gods and heroes . You say you called him Siegfried . This made you an easy subject for this experiment . I am sorry that you were used in this way but believe me it has probably saved your reason . " " Why should I have thought of such a marriage ? " " Because you were no longer a virgin and you had thought , as a respectably brought-up girl , that this could not be the case without marriage . That 's an easy conclusion . Your terror when you knew what was happening to you has to find its opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Why should I have thought him to be a count ? I never thought of marrying a count . " " He had seemed all powerful  --  rich , a nobleman . That is easily explained . " " But Lokenburg . " " Well , we are in the Lokenwald . The name of the town is Lokenburg . Ah , I think I have it . There is a Count Lokenburg . " My heart began to beat wildly . I cried : " Then take me to him . I am sure he must be Maximilian . I know he was not lying to me . " Dr. Carlsberg rose ; he led me out of the room and took me to a picture which was hanging on the wall . I had noticed it when I arrived but had not studied it particularly . It was a picture of a bearded man , more elderly than middle-aged , in uniform . " It 's the head of our ruling house , " he said , " you will see his picture in many loyal households @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl VIII Carl Frederic Ludwig Maximilian Duke of Rochenstein and Dorrenig , Count of Lokenburg . " " Carl Frederic Ludwig Maximilian , " I said dully . " Duke of Rochenstein and Count of Lokenburgl " " The Lokenburg title is one of Duke Carl 's , " he said . " Then why did he . . . " " You had looked at the picture . " " I had never looked at it closely . " " You looked at it without realizing you did . The names became fixed in your memory without your suspecting it and in your dream you selected one of them  --  Maximilian  --  and attached it to one of the titles you had seen on the in-scription . " I put my hands over my eyes . But he was so clear to me . I could see his beloved face , with the passionate , arroganteyes that gleamed for me . I would not believe that I had imagined that.  |p92But  they had the tangible evidence ; for the first time there was a doubt in my mind . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on my lap thinking of him . My ears were strained for the sound of horses ' hoofs because I believed that I should hear them and that he would come into the house , his eyes alight with passion . " What have they been trying to tell you , Lenchen ? " he would demand , and turn on them in his fury ; and they would cringe , as in the dream my cousins had appeared to  --  well not exactly cringe , but they had been eager to placate him . But this , according to them , had not been the case . They had never known each other . How could living people know a phantom ? In the dream they had shown respect because that was what I expected them to do . None of it , according to them , had existed . But it had . I could feel his arms about me . I could rememberso many passionate and tender moments . I knew what Ilse was thinking : " Could I really believe that a count would suddenly decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day after his decision a priest married them ? " Oh , yes , they had reason on their side , and I had nothing but dreams . I could not produce my wedding ring or my marriage lines . If I had ever had them , where were they now ? Suddenly I thought : There 's the hunting lodge . I must go back there . I would find Hildegarde and Hans . I was excited . If I could go back to the lodge Hildegarde would corroborate my story about the marriage . But if she did , that would mean that Cousin Ilse was lying , Ernst too , and the doctor . Why should they ? What motive could they possibly have ? If I believed that , I must get away from them as soon as possible for they would be my enemies . They were trying to prove . . . what were they trying to prove ?  |p93Sometimes  I thought : I 'm going mad . Were they trying to prove me mad ? For what purpose ? They were trying to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been near when I came in according to them , the victim of a savage attack in the forest . Maximilian savage ! Passionate he was and fierce at times but he loved me , for he had been tender , and he had said that desiring me as he did , he was determined that I should come to him willingly . My thoughts were going round in circles . I must know the truth . I must try to be calm . I must face the facts . I must see the truth . Where was my ring ? Where were my marriagelines ? I could see them clearly now  --  the plain gold band , the writing on the paper . But they could not be found . I must know the truth . I had lost six days from my life and I must know what had happened to me , on the Night of the Seventh Moon . Did I meet the one man whom I could love , did I marry him , did I live for three ecstatic days in his hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a - nonsterwho robbed me temporarily of my sanity ? I must know the truth . I would go to the lodge . I would see Hildegarde and Hans and if they told me that I had never been there except on that one night when he had brought me there in the mist , I would have to believe them . Then I would see him . And I would then know whether he was indeed my husband . At the very earliest moment I must go back to the lodge . Ilse consulted Dr. Carlsberg and they all agreed that I must have my way . " How should we find this lodge ? " asked use . " It is not far from Leichenkin  --  some eight miles I think . And you remember , Ilse , when you drove me over for my wedding ... " She looked at me blankly , sadly . " Well , we 'll try to find it , " she said.  | Ernst drove the horses ; use and I sat side by side ; she had taken my hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed at that night when you were lost in the mist . It will help you if you see the servantwhom you saw then . " I was thinking of Hildegarde . If she told me that I had never been there but once , I should have to believe her . I was afraid and my fear ' - as a sign that I was beginning to waver . When there was so much evidence how could one go on believing in what they were telling me was a dream ? Is it possible ? I asked myself . Can such things be done ? I kept thinking of Dr. Carlsberg 's calm intelligent and kindly face . What point would there be in their trying to confuse me ? Yet on the other hand what did I know of Maximilian ? He had never really told me anything about his life . I had no idea even where he lived . The more I thought of everything that happened the more flimsy it seemed . I could not remember the road . On the first occasion we had taken it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not noticed any landmarks . That had been my wedding day . I had been driven along in a daze of excitement , and when we had come back after Maximilian 's departure I had been thinking of him and wondering when he would come back and had not noticed the road then either . Ernst had driven to Leichenkin and when we reached the town with its gable-roofed houses clustered round theP f arrkirche we were not far from the Damenstift . I looked at the convent with some emotion , but it was not my schooldays that I remembered but that morning when Hildegarde had driven me back from the hunting lodge and how desolate I had been then because I feared I would never see him again . I was a hundred times more so now , but my spirits were rising . When we found the lodge I would see Hildegarde . She would tell them that I had stayed there three days and nights as Maximilian 's bride . But what of use and Ernst ? They could surely not be suffering from de-lusions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to find the way from here . You say it was some eight miles from the Damenstift . " " Yes . I 'm sure of that . " " But in what direction ? " I pointed toward the south . " I am sure that is the way I remember driving up to the Damenstift with Hildegarde from there . " Ernst took the road which was straight for some miles as I remembered it . We came to a fork and he hesitated . " It 's a wild goose chase , " he said . " No , " said use , " we must find the lodge . It 's the only thing that will satisfy Helena . " I was sure it was the left hand fork . I seemed to remember the gray farmhouse down the road . We went on . This was the road Schwester Maria had taken on that fateful afternoon . We climbed and soon were in the pine forest . Here was the very spot where we had picnicked . There Schwester Maria had sat under the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream that had become a nightmare . " Now the lodge you visited on that night could not be very far from here , " said Ernst . Unfortunately I could not direct them . We took one turningand drove on for a while . We saw a man gathering wood . Ernst pulled up and asked him if he knew of a huntinglodge nearby . The man paused , set down his bundle and scratched his head . Yes , there was a lodge . A fine lodge , belonged to a lord or a count or some nobleman . My spirits began to raise , my heart was beating fast . Oh , God , I prayed . Let this be it . Let me find Hildegarde . Let me come out of this nightmare . Yes , he could tell us . If we were to go straight on to the end of the road , then take the path that climbed a bit and then a sharp veer to the left , there we would find a hunting lodge.  | " They come here in the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's boar in the forest . Sometimes it 's stags . " Ernst thanked him and we drove on in silence . I felt it took a long time to climb and I was impatient because we were forced to slacken our pace . And then we reached the top of the hill and I cried out in delight for there was the grove of pine trees that I remembered . The lodge was just beyond them . Ernst drove on ; we were in the grove now because the road ran through them  --  just as I remembered . There were the two stone posts and beyond them were the gray walls which I knew so well . I cried out in joy . " We 're here ! " I wanted to leap out of the carriage but Ilse restrainedme . " Be careful , Helena , " she said . " You 're not strong yet . " Ernst fixed the reins to the post and we alighted . I ran forward . There was a strange silence everywhere . I noticed that the stables had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . It was from them that Hans had come out to take our horses when we had been riding . I could not understand . It seemed different . Everything was different . This was the lodge . Those were the stone posts . Those were the walls . There was no door . I could see through into emptiness . I was looking at the shell of the hunting lodge where until that moment I had been certain that I had been married to Maximilian. use was beside me , her arm slipped through mine , her eyes compassionate . " Oh , Helena , " she said , " come away . " But I would n't . I ran through that gap where the door had been . I stood inside those blackened walls . There was nothing there  --  nothing of the room where we had dined , the bedroom we had shared , my little room where I had spent the first night , the blue room which contained anotherp97woman 's clothes , the hall with its stuffed heads of animals and weapons hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is the place , " I cried . " Helena , my poor child , " said use . " But what has happened to it ? " I demanded . " It looks as though it has been burned out at some time . Come away now . Come home . You have had enough . " I did n't want to go . I wanted to stand there in that ruin and think of it all . How could I remember a dream so vividly ? It was n't possible . I could not bear my misery , becauseevery minute they were convincing me that what had happened had indeed been unreal. use led me back to the carriage . We drove home in silence . There was nothing more I could think of . The evidence against the fact that I had married was overwhelming . Back at the house I sank into a deep depression . use tried to interest me in embroidery and cooking . I was listless . Sometimes I would let myself dream that Maximilian came hack for me ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear I should again stray into a dangerous realm of fancy . Not only was I desolate and melancholy while my heart called out for my husband , but I was afraid of myself . There was a great deal of talk about the powers of suggestion and hypnotism . The fame of the Fox sisters had spread from America to England some ten years ago ; they believed that it was possible to communicate with the dead ; and although the world was full of skeptics many people were convinced that it was becoming increasingly easier to accept what some time ago would have appeared to be completely incredible , and that certain people were possessed of knowledgeand the power to reveal undreamed of secrets . Dr. Carlsberg was clearly experimenting with new forms of treatment ; and because of my circumstances I was a likely subject for his tests.  |p98I  no longer felt that I was uncomplicated Helena Trant . I had had , according to the evidence , a frightening experience , which many believed was the worst which could befallan innocent young girl or I had enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Iwas not sure which . If they were right , I had lost six days of my life and those were the days during which I had known a state of existence which I could never hope to experience again ; I had loved with a deep abiding passion a man who they told me was a phantom . I could never love again in that way . I had therefore suffered an irreparable loss . I felt I was a stranger to myself . I often looked searchinglyin the mirror and felt I did not know the face which was reflected there . How could I help it when I was not at all sure whether I myself was not in the plot to blot out the fearful memory of a terrifying experience by replacing it with a dream of perfection ? Sometimes I awoke in the night startled because I had dreamed that I was being pursued through the forest by a monster who had disguised himself as Maximilian . I thought in that waking moment : Was that how it happened ? We had gone into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was that the moment when I started to dream ? I was afraid . I watched everything that I did spontaneously . I had a fear that I was becoming unbalanced . Luisa , my mother 's cousin  --  of whom my mother had never spoken  --  had gone mad . I was frightened . I clung to use . There was something so kind and compassionateabout her . The manner in which she would take care of me , to take my mind off my tragedy , was touching . I could see so clearly what she was trying to do . The days began to pass . I was listless , unless at any time I heard the sound of horses ' hoofs , and then I would start up expectantly for I could not rid myself of the hope that one day Maximilian would come to claim me . Dr. Carlsberg came every day to visit me . His care for me was wonderful.  |p99I  think it must have been about a week after I awoke to the nightmare that use told me they would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . He must return to Denkendorf . He had his work there . I listened idly to their conversation . There had been some plot to replace Duke Carl by his brother Ludwig . They chattered excitedly about it and were clearly delighted that it had gone against Ludwig . They were very loyal to the Duke . So shortly after that we said goodbye to Dr. Carlsberg , who assured me that I would gradually regain my old spirits if I could stop brooding on what had happened and learn to accept it as a regrettable accident . No good could be done by brooding . In fact only harm could come of it . I said to Ilse as we left , " What if Maximilian should come here to look for me ? He said he would come to the lodge but he wanted me to go to you . . . so he will know ... " I stopped . She looked so sad . Then she said : " We have taken the house before . The owner knows we come from Denkendorf . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we had gone . " I was sorry to hurt her by this proof that I believed she had lied to me , but she understood . She knew that I still had to cling to the dream . Denkendorf was like so many of the little towns I had seen in this part of the world . The center of the town had its shops under the arcades ; the pavements were cobbled and the aspect medieval . Because this was a spa and people came to take the waters there were several inns ; and the shops were well stocked , the streets more lively than those of Lokenburg . We were near a river and it was possible to walk out to its bank and see there perched on the opposite bank the ruin of a castle in pale silver gray stone . I realized when we arrived there that I had grown a little away from my nightmare ; I had begun to accept , which I had believed I never could . It was possible , I knew , forp100people to be drugged to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was possible to evoke dreams that seemed real . How could I doubt that good kind use was speaking the truth ? I should have known that what I had imagined was too wildly and fantastically wonderful to be true . We had only just settled in to Denkendorf when Ernst left us to go to Rochenberg , the capital city of the Duchy of Rochenstein . This crisis in the affairs of the country meant that in spite of his indifferent health he was recalled to his post in the government , so use and I were alone together . We grew very close . She would not let me go out without her and each morning we would go into the market to shop . Sometimes she introduced me as her English cousin and I would join in the conversation which ensued somewhatautomatically . How did I like the country ? How long was I going to stay with my cousin ? To these I always replied that I found the country interesting and that I was not sure how long I would stay . I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I thought of what I should have been like a few weeks ago I was appalled . I would never again be that carefree impulsive girl who had attracted Maximilian . . . But how could she have captivated a phantom ? In the beginning , I reasoned with myself , he was attracted by me . There was no harm in thinking of that incident which had begun in the mist . That had actually happened . I wrote to the aunts and in time received letters from them . By that time I had been in Denkendorf for six weeks . Each day was much the same . Ernst paid occasional visits ; I learned to embroider and do tapestry work  --  very fine petit point  --  on which we could only work by day . In the evenings we did ordinary sewing or embroidery . I read a great many books on German history and I was particularly interested in the ancestors of Carl , Duke of Rochenstein . It was astonishing how quickly the time was passing.  |p101Aunt  Caroline wrote of the affairs which concerned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many jars of blackcurrant jelly ; she implied that she expected the soon to be coming home . She could not understand why I had wanted to go gadding about in the first place . Aunt Matilda wrote of the strange wheezing Aunt Caroline had developed . She got quite breathless ; and there was mention of Mr. Clees ' solitary kidney which had to do the work of two ; and Amelia Glees was looking a little pale ; Aunt Matilda hoped she was not going into a decline as , she had gathered , her mother had . There was a great deal about Mr. Glees in Aunt Matilda 's letter . It seemed that a man who had had a wife in a decline and himself possessed only one kidney was very attractive . I heard from Mrs. Greville too . They missed me and wondered when I planned to come back . She and Mr. Greville might manage a trip out so that I could come back with them . Anthony had said only the other day that it did n't seem the same without me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed so far away . The thought of going back there and trying to pretend that everything was the same as it always had been did not attract me . Ilse came in suddenly . She had a way of gliding about as though not to disturb me . " What 's the matter , Helena ? " she asked . " You are looking . . . lost . " " Letters from home , " I explained . " I was thinking of goingback there . " " You 're not ready yet , are you ? " " I do n't think I could face them . " " No , not just yet . It 'll change . But there is nothing to worry about . You must stay here with us until you are ready to go . " " Dear Ilse , " I said , " what should I have done without you ? "  |p102She  turned away to hide her emotion . She always liked to keep her feelings in check . Several more weeks passed . Perhaps I was becoming reconciled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though I had changed my personality . I smiled rarely and remembering the old days when I had been so often unable to restrain my laughter I was astonished . And yet I suppose what I had endured  --  whichever was the truth  --  would most certainly change one . As time passed everything seemed to point to the fact that those six days had been spent in my bed . I continued to hope that Maximilian would come for me . I used to look at faces in the streets of the little town and every time I saw a tall man in the distance my heart would leap with hope . Each passing day meant that a little of my hope must fade . If there had really been a marriage , where was my husband ? Surely he would have come to claim me ? I suppose when I had seen that shell where the lodge had been I had begun to accept the truth of what Ilse , Ernst , and Dr. Carlsberg had told me . But I felt as though a part of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same insouciant girl I had been before . Ilse appeared to have no friends in the place so there was no visiting . She explained that she and Ernst had only recently come to live in Denkendorf and the people being rather formal would take some time before they accepted them . I tried to interest myself in the vegetables she bought in the market or the skeins of silk we chose for our embroidery ; but I simply did not care whether we ate carrots or onions or chose purple or azure blue for the flowers we were working . I went about my days mechanically . I was once more in limbo , waiting .. . I was not sure for what . In the shops we visited , people often mentioned Count Ludwig 's attempted coup . They all seemed delighted thatp103It had failed . I often saw pictures similar to that which Dr. Carlsberg had pointed out in the hall of the house in 1okenburg . There was the same face and the inscription , C : irl Ludwig Maximilian , Seventh Duke of Rochenstein and Uorrenig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those were the words ou which my eyes lingered . It is a strange feeling to know that a part of your life is wrapped in mystery , and that you have been unconscious of what happened to you during that period . You feel apart from your fellow human beings . You are both a stranger among them and to yourself . I tried to explain this to Ilse , for I was talking to her very freely and intimately now ; she said she understood and she knew that in time I would grow away from this . " Never hesitate to talk to me , " she said , " that is if you wish to do so . The last thing I want to do is force confidence , but I want you to know that I am here if you should need " I shall have to think about going home soon , " I told her . " Not yet , " she begged . " I want to wait until you are quite recovered before you leave us . " " Quite recovered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You think so now because it is so close ... later you will see . " Oh yes , she comforted me a great deal . Yet each day I awoke I said to myself : I must go home . It was only to be a short visit and it was two months since I had left England . One morning I woke up feeling ill . I was frightened because I remembered waking in my bed and learning that what I believed had happened had been only in my lnuigination . I got out of bed and felt dizzy. 1 sat on the edge of the bed wondering , whether I hadp104been unconscious for another six days . This time there were no pleasant memories . I was still sitting there when there was a knock on the door and Ilse looked in . " Are you all right , Helena ? " she asked anxiously . " Yes , I think so . I just felt a little dizzy . " " Do you think I should get the doctor ? " " No ... no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me that I have been in bed for days and did n't go to the town with you yesterday ? " She shook her head . " No . No . Dr. Carlsberg has not been treating you since you have been here . But I 'm sorry you feel dizzy . I wonder whether you ought to see a doctor . " " No , no , " I insisted . " It is already passing . " She looked at me intently , and I said I would get up . We went into the town and it was just such another day as those which had preceded it . It suddenly occurred to me that if I went home I would be able to think more clearly . I would be able to assess my adventure against the reality of home . Here I still sensed the bewitchment . The very cobbled streets and gabled shops with their creaking signs were like the settings ofthe old fairy stories . I could not get out of my mind the belief that here the home of trolls , hobgoblins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At home among the towers and spires of Oxford where I might listen to the prosaic talk of the aunts and enjoy the friendly atmosphere of the Grevilles home , I would reason clearly . I would begin to understand what had happened to me . One morning I said to Ilse : " I think I must get ready to go home . " She looked at me anxiously . " Do you really want to ? " I hesitated . " I think it would be better to . " " This decision surely means that you are beginning to accept what has happened . You are getting over the shock . " " Perhaps . I know that I have to come out of the strangep105state into which I have fallen . I 've got to go on living . I would do it best where I belong . " She touched my hand gently . " My dear child , you are welcome to stay here as long as you wish . You know that . Butt I feel that you are right . In Oxford resuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to ) , on . You will realize that it is not the first time a young girl has been so cruelly awakened to the cruder aspects of life . " " It is perhaps the first time a girl has believed herself to have been married and discovered that she has lost six days of her life . " " Of that I am not sure . But I am firmly of the opinion that what Dr. Carlsberg did was right and the only thing to do in the circumstances . He had blotted out an evil thing and replaced it by something beautiful . " " But , according to you all , the evil was the truth and the beauty a dream . " " Alas ... but the memory of evil has been obliterated . While you have suffered , my dear , you have the consolation of knowing that you have been of great help to Dr. Carlsberg . You have proved his experiment to be so successful that you can not even remember the brutality you suffered and you still persist in believing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it that has made you accept it ; and I believe that deep in your heart you still believe that you married this man . " How well she had summed up my feelings . " So I have been a kind of guinea pig in Dr. Carlsberg 's researches . " " Only because the circumstances were as helpful to you as they were to him . But tell me , Helena , do you still believe lu this marriage ? " " I know everything is against it , but it is as clear in my mind as it ever was . And I believe it always will be . " She nodded . " And I believe that is what Dr. Carlsberg would wish . " She paused for a moment . " Helena , I want you to know that as soon as you wish to go I shall take youp106back . Will you see Dr. Carlsberg once more ? I should like you to see him before you go . " I hesitated . I felt a sudden revulsion for the man which I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been kind to me ; he had , according to himself , Ilse , and Ernst , saved my reason . Yet I did not want to see him again . I wondered whether if I had faced the truth in the first place I might not have been better able to cope with the situation . Bluntly , I had been assaulted in the most cruel and brutal way . If I had come back that night knowing this how should I have reacted ? I was not sure . But there was one thing of which I was certain . The man whom I had met on the Night of the Seventh Moon was the same one who had found me in the mist . If he had been the cruel ravisher of that night would he have hesitated when I was in his lodge ? I thought of the door handle slowly turning . The door was bolted . But would that have been any real deterrent to a man determined to have his way ? If they had let me face the truth I believed I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had nearly lost my reason . I had been frivolous and impulsive but never hysterical . How could I be sure what I would have been like suffering under such an outrage ? We do not really know ourselves and it is only when we face a crisis that unexpected facets of our characters are betrayed . Ilse went on : " I should feel so relieved if he could see you as an ordinary physician this time . I know that he greatly wishes it and I should like to have his advice about your going home . " I said I would see him , and she wrote to him that day . His reply came . He would be with us in two days ' time . I had had a few more dizzy spells on rising and I was wondering if I was going to be ill . Ilse asked how I was solicitously every morning ; she seemed very concerned . " I think I ought to get home soon , " I said . " Everything will be different then . "  |p107I  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to claim me by now . Each passing day was confirmation that the marriage had never taken place . If I could get away I would perhaps forget . Home seemed so remote from all that happened ; so presumably when I was home , this would be remote . I could start again . I wrote to Aunt Caroline and Mrs. Greville to tell them I should be coming home shortly . The evenings I had spent at the Grevilles ' house had been the most enjoyable of that lx , riod . I remembered how amused I had been because of their admiration for Anthony and how Anthony talking above our heads had a pleasant way of assuming that we understood . It was all so cozy  --  the last word I could apply to this place  --  and I was beginning to see the virtues of that coziness from which I had wanted to escape . Dr. Carlsberg came as arranged . I was in the little garden when he arrived and did not hear him come . He must have been with Ilse for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found him there . When he saw me his face lit up with pleasure . He rose and took both my hands in his . " How are you ? " he asked . When I told him that I felt I was getting back to normal lie smiled with pleasure and gratification . Ilse left us togetherand he wanted to know every detail of what had happened . What dreams had I had ? Had I suffered from nightmares ? Every little item seemed of the utmost importance to him . Then he asked about my physical health and I told him that I often felt unwell on rising . He said he would like to examine me . Would I agree ? I did . I shall never forget what followed . It was one of the most dramatic moments in my life . " I have to tell you that you are to have a child , " he said.  |p108I  was deeply moved by the manner in which Ilse received the news . She was stricken with horror and dismay . " Oh God ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself comforting her , for to tell the truth I could only feel exultation . I was to have a child  --  his child . I was not mad . He had existed . From the moment I realized this I started to emerge from the depth of my unhappiness . My own child ! I did not think of the difficulties which must inevitably lie ahead simply because I could see nothingbeyond the wonder of having our child . I knew then that deep in my heart I must always believe that Maximilian had loved me . I could not associate him with a criminal in the forest ; the prospect of bearing his child could do nothing but fill me with a fierce exhilaration . When the doctor had gone use said to me : " Helena , do you realize what this means ? " " Yes , I do . " I could not help it if my delight was obvious.  |p109I  had possessed what my father called a mercurial temperament . " Up and down , " said my mother . " Irresponsible , " Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me odd and illogical . I had been sunk in depression when I had had every chance of putting an ugly incident behind me and starting a new life ; and now that that would be impossiblebecause there would be a living reminder , I was rejoicing . I could n't help it . The wonder of having a child subdued all else . " This is shattering , " said use at length . " That this should have happened as well as everything else . . . 1 What can we do now ? You ca n't go back to England . Helena , have you thought of what this is going to mean ? " But all I could think was : I am going to have a child . " We must be practical , " she warned me . " Can you go back to your aunts and tell them that you are going to have u child ? What will they say ? You would be disgraced . They might not even receive you . If I wrote to them and told them what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will have to stay here until the child is born . It 's the only way . Yes , we shall have to arrange that . " I had to confess I had not given much consideration to the months between  --  only the arrival of the child . I should like a boy but I would not think about that until it came . I f it were a girl I should not wish her to think that I was hot completely delighted with her . But I was right . I must try to be practical . What was I going to do ? How was I going to keep the child , educate it , bring it up in the best possible way ? It would have no father . And what should I do while I waited for the child to be born ? The first exultation had passed . Ilse seemed to have come to a decision . " You must stay with us , Helena , and I shall look after you . I shall never forgive myself for going out that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , we will arrange something . you 'll be all right . You can trust us. "  | She seemed to have grown calmer ; the first horror had passed and characteristically she was making plans . The first feeling of triumphant joy had passed . I had had a glimpse of how I should have felt if I had been truly married to Maximilian and he had been with me so that wecould have shared the joy of prospective parenthood . I asked myself if there was not something I could do to find him . He was the father of my child . Yet what could I do ? If I talked this over with use I would see that sad patient look come into her face . I had given up trying to make her understandthat no matter what evidence they showed me I could never believe that I had dreamed my life with Maximilian . I began to make wild plans . I would travel the country looking for him . I would call at every house seeking information concerning him . Now that I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Ilse : " Could I put an advertisement in the newspapers ? . Could I ask him to come back to me. " use looked horrified : " Do you believe that a man who did that would answer such an advertisement ? " " I was thinking . . . " I began ; and saw how hopeless it was to talk to Ilse for she insisted that tho Maximilian I had known had never existed . She was patient with me . " Suppose you mentioned Count Lokenburg . You would be deemed mad . There could even be trouble . " So whichever way I looked I could do nothing . I knew that she was right about my not going home . The aunts would be horrified at the prospect of sheltering an unmarried pregnant niece . I could imagine the scandal . No one would believe the story of the attack in the forestanymore than they would believe that other version of my unusual marriage . I needed Ilse ' s kindnesses and ingenuity to help me in my difficult situation , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon her calm and practical self.  | " You will certainly have to stay here until after the child is born . Then we shall have to decide from there . " " I have a little money , but it is not enough to keep us and educate the child . " " We 'll think about that later , " she said . Ernst came back . His health seemed much better and when he heard the news he shared Ilse 's horror and compassion . They were both very gentle with me and very anxious because they assumed guilt for what had happened . He and use , I know , discussed my affairs continuously but for me the state of euphoria persisted and every so often I would forget my circumstances and think solely of the delight of having a child . Sometimes I wondered whether Dr. Carlsberg had given them something to put Into my food to make me happy . I had a terrible thought once that he might have made me imagine I was going to have a child . I did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it such a tragedy . But once one has been the subject of such an experiment one becomes suspicious . a We all decided that for the time being we would not tell the aunts , and during the next months would think very carefully what we should do . In the meantime an excuse must be made to keep me with my cousin . Ilse took that into her own hands and wrote to Aunt Caroline to tell her that I was staying on because Ernst had taken a turn for the worse and she needed my help . " A little white lie , " she said with a grimace . So I stayed on in Denkendorf and the weeks began to slip by . I no longer felt ill when I arose ; and I thought constantly of the baby . I bought material and started to make a layette . I would sit for hours stitching and thinking . Dr. Carlsberg came to me . He said he was going to pass me over to Dr. Kleine , a doctor friend of his who had a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon he would drive me over and introduce me to his colleague . There , in Dr. Kleine 's clinic , I should have the child.  | I wondered about the cost but they would n't discuss it and in my present state I was content to let things go . Ilse said one day : " When the child is born you can stay with us for a while and perhaps later on you could take a post teaching English in one of our schools . It might just be possible to have the child with you . " " Do you think there would be such a post ? " " Dr. Carlsberg might be able to help . He and his colleaguesknow a great deal that is going on . They would find out and if there was anything I am sure they would be only too glad to help . " " You are so good to me , all of you , " I cried gratefully . " We feel responsible , " replied use . " Ernst and I will never forget that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you were under our care . " I was content to allow them to plan for me , which was unlike myself because I had always been so independent . It certainly seemed as though the Seventh Moon had cast a spell upon me and all my actions had become unpredictable . So I allowed Ilse to cosset me . I was almost unaware of what went on . I stitched at my little garments and delightedlyfolded them when they were done and laid them away in the drawer I had prepared for them . White , blue , and pink . Blue for a boy , they said . So I would have both pink and blue so that I should not have planned for either sex . I knitted and sewed and read . The summer passed and the autumn was with us . Aunt Caroline wrote that she was surprised that I should enjoy living with foreigners in some outlandish place rather than in my own home but Aunt Matilda , realizing that my cousin Ernst had a " heart " and hearts being funny things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . Mrs. Greville wrote . She had heard that I was staying on to help my cousin nurse her husband . She thought it wouldp113be a good experience for me , but she and her husband as well as Anthony were looking forward to my return . They all seemed so far away in the world of reality where life pursued an even tenor . The fantastic adventures of the last months had sent me worlds away from them . One day use said : " Dr. Carlsberg has news . He says that the nuns at your old Damensti f t would take you in to teach English to the pupils . You could have the child with you . " " You do so much for me , " I said emotionally . " It 's our duty , " replied Ilse solemnly . " In any case we are so fond of you . We must think of the future , you know . " I was growing obviously larger . I could feel the movement of my child and whenever I did my heart leaped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , if this life within me was the result of an encounter with a savage brute in the forest ? I would never stop believing in those ecstatic days  --  no matter what evidence they brought forward to try to convince me that they had never existed. use introduced me to people in the town when it was necessary as Mrs. Trant , who had recently suffered a bereavement in the loss of her husband and who was shortly to bear his posthumous child . I was seen as a tragic figure and people were very kind to me . When I went into the market they called to me to ask how I was . I would stop and chat with them and the women would tell me about their childbearing , the men about their vigils during their wives ' ordeals . Dr. Carlsberg came along one day and drove me into the town of Klarengen where his friend had his nursing home . Ilse thought it was better for me to see the doctor there at this stage . I did so and Dr. Kleine told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nursing home to be prepared I or the birth of the child . He called me Mrs. Trant and had evidently been told the story about my recent bereavement.  |p114As  we drove away Dr. Carlsberg said : " You can rely on Dr. Kleine . He 's the best man in his line in these parts . " " I 'm wondering if I shall be able to pay . " " We are taking care of that , " he said . " I ca n't accept . . . " " It 's easy to give , " he said ruefully . " So difficult to receive . But it is you who must give us the satisfaction of helping you out of this situation . I know your cousin is filled with self-reproach . She and her husband can only regain their peace of mind if they do everything possible for you . As for me , you have helped me in my work tremendously . You have given me an opportunity to prove a theory . I ca n't thank you enough . Please tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hesitated and he said : " I see that you can not give up your belief in the dream . " " I lived it , " I said . " Of the other . . . I remember nothing . He nodded . " It is even better than I thought . And now that you are to have the child you believe that child is the fruit of your marriage , and that is the reason why you feel ready to welcome it . Had you thought . . . but no matter . This is good . Anything we can do for you we shall be delighted to do , rest assured of that . " Sometimes , looking back , I ask myself : Why did you accept this and that ? Why did you not inquire more closely into these strange things that happened to you ? I suppose the answer is : I was very young and I appeared to have stepped into a world where strange things seemed the naturalcourse of events . I was brought down to reality one day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use usedto drive me into Klarengen ; she would put the trap in an innyard and shop while I went to Dr. Kleine 's nursing home . He was satisfied with my progress and he did pay veryspecial attention to me on Dr. Carlsberg 's instruction . I hadp115had a shock , Dr. Carlsberg had told him  --  Dr. Kleine believedthis to be the death of my husband  --  and in the circumstances might have a difficult confinement . On this February day the sun was brilliant and there was a frost in the air . As I came out of the nursing home a voice behind me startled me as it took me right back to Oxford . " If it is n't Helena Trant ! " I turned and there were the Misses Elkington who ran a little tea shop near the Castle Mound , which was only open during the summer months . They sold tea and coffee with homemade cakes besides egg cozies , tea cozies , and embroideredmats which they made themselves . I had never liked them . They were constantly apologizing for selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something they were not used to as they had come down in the world , their father having been a general . " Oh , it 's Miss Edith and Miss Rose , " I said . " Well , fancy meeting you here of all places . " Their little eyes scrutinized me . They must have seen me come out of Dr. Kleine 's nursing home and would be wondering why . But not for long . Although I wore a loose coat my condition could not but be perfectly obvious . " And what are you doing here , Helena ? " Miss Elkington the elder was roguishly censorious . " I 'm staying with my cousin . " " Oh yes , of course , you 've been away some months . " " I daresay I shall soon be back . " " Well , well . It is a small world . So you are really staying here ? " " Not exactly . I 've come in with my cousin . I 'm joining her now . " " I 'm so glad we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see people from home , " added her sister . " I must hurry . My cousin is waiting ... " I was relieved to get away from them.  |p116I  looked at my reflection in a shop window . I did n't think there could be much doubt of my condition . The weeks had passed and my time was getting near . use fussed over me ; often I would find her seated in silence with a worried frown on her forehead and I knew she was concerned for me . She had consulted both Drs . Carlsberg and Kleine and they had decided that I should go into Dr. Kleine 's nursing home a week or so before my child was expected . As for myself I continued in my state of placid euphoria . I could think of nothing but my child . " You will have to wait until the baby is about a year old before you go to the Damenstift to teach English , " said Ilse . " Dr. Carlsberg has not mentioned your name , but on his recommendation no obstacles would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How strange that would be ! I thought . I remembered the old days ( good heavens ! It was not two years ago ) when I had been a pupil  --  Helena Trant who had always been in trouble through her irrepressible spirits and love of adventure . How strange that I might go back a mother . I pictured Schwester . Maria taking sly peeps at the baby and trying to spoil it , and Schwester Gudrun saying : " Where Helena Trant was , there was always trouble . " Then sometimes I would think of those three days and my love was as strong as ever making the longing to see Maximilian unbearable . Only the thought of our child could comfort me and I eagerly waited for the time when I should hold it in my arms . On a bright April day Ilse drove me to the nursing home . I was taken to a private room , apart from the other patients . Dr. Carlsberg had asked that this should be so in view of the circumstances . It was a pleasant room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanliness . There was a windowp117from which I could look down on a lawn , which was very neatly bordered by flower beds . Dr. Kleine introduced me to his wife , who expressed concern for my comfort . I asked how many other mothers were in the nursing home and I was told that there were several . They were constantly coming and going . On the first day I looked through my window and saw five or six women walking about the lawn  --  all in various stages of pregnancy . They were chatting together and two of them sat side by side on one of the wooden benches near the flower beds ; one was knitting , the other crocheting . They were joined by another woman who took out her sewing ; and they talked animatedly together . I was sorry they had decided to isolate me . I wanted to be down there with those other women. 1 had been told that I could use the Kleines ' little gardento get some fresh air , but this was not the one where the women met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while on a garden seat but there was no one there and 1 wanted to talk about babies , to compare knitting . While I was in the garden Fran Kleine came out to me and I told her I had seen another garden from my room . " ' There 's a lawn and there were several expectant mothers there . I should like to talk to them . " She looked alarmed . " I think the doctor does n't feel that would be wise . " " Why not ? " " I suppose he thinks it might upset you . " " Why ever should it ? " " They all have homes and husbands . I think he thinks it Wright depress you . " " It would n't , " I cried vehemently . And I thought then I would not change the father of my child for any respectable husband these women might have . Then I knew that the reason I could be so happy was that I still believed that one day Maximilian would come back for me and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me there flourished still my childish dream that we should live happilyever after . When I went back to my room the first thing I did was look out of the window . The lawn was deserted ; they had all gone back to their rooms . But I determined to go down to the lawn . Dr. Kleine now knew my story ( Dr. Carlsberg had thought it wise to tell him ) but it had been agreed that for the purposes of preventing gossip  --  which would have been magnified in any case and no doubt distorted  --  I was to be known as Mrs. Trant , a widow who had lost her husband some months before . It was early afternoon , the siesta hour , when I decided to find my way down to the lawn . The house appeared to have been built round the garden which contained the lawn , and the women I had seen there had come from a door completely opposite the wing in which I had my room . I would have to work my way round to it so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen the women emerge . I opened my door quietly . There was not a sound in the corridor . I went swiftly to a flight of stairs , descended it and found myself on a landing . I went along this in what I thought was the right direction and I came to a short flight of stairs which led to a door . As I approached I heard the sound of sobbing . I paused and listened . There was no doubt that someone was in great distress . I hesitated , wondering whether it would be better to find out if I could be of use or to ignore what I heard . Then , on impulse , I went up the three or four stairs and knocked on the door . The sobbing stopped . I knocked again . " Who 's there ? " said a high-pitched frightened voice . " May I come in ? " I asked . There was a sound which could have been an affirmative so I opened the door and entered a room rather like my own but smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my own age , her face swollen with crying , her hair in disorder.  |p119We  stared at each other . " What 's wrong ? " I asked . " Everything , " she replied bleakly . I approached the bed and sat on it . " I feel so terrible , " she said . " Should I call someone ? " She shook her head . " It 's not that . I wish it were . It 's long overdue . I know I 'm going to die . " " Of course you wo n't . You 'll feel better when the baby comes . " Again she shook her head . " I do n't know what I 'm going to do . Last night I thought of jumping out of the window . " " Oh no ! " " It 's different for you . You 've got a husband and a home and it 's all going to be wonderful . " I did n't answer . I said : " And you have n't ? " " We should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months ago . He was in the Duke 's Guard and the bombwas meant for the Duke . He would have married me . " " So he was a soldier . " She nodded . " We would have been married if he 'd lived , " she reiterated . In the Duke 's Guard , I was thinking . Duke Carl of Hochenstein and Dorrenig , Count of Lokenburg . " Your family will look after you , " I soothed . Again the doleful shake of the head . " No they wo n't . They wo n't have me back . They brought me to Dr. Kleine but when it 's over they wo n't have me back . I tried to kill myself once before . I walked out into the river but then I was frightened and they rescued me and brought me here . " She was small and very young and frightened and I longed to help her . I wanted to tell her that I myself had a future to face which might not be easy , but my story was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover who had come to an untimely end . She was only sixteen , she told me . I felt so much older and protective . I said it was always wrong to despair . I wasp120of some use to her , I believe , because of my recent suffering . I could recall , because it was so recent , the terrible desolationwhich had swept over me when I had been told that my romantic marriage was nothing but a myth . At least I thought this girl had a plausible tragedy to relate . I made her talk and she told me about the town of Rochenberg , the chief city of Rocherlstein. where she had lived with her grandmother who remembered the day the present Duke 's father died , and he became the head of theruling house . He had always been a good and seriousmindedDuke  --  rather different from his son Prince Carl who was notoriously wild . Her grandmother had been a great loyalist and she would have welcomed a soldier of the Duke 's Guard into the family , but if he had been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But thatmade it all the more terrible because if they had not forestalled their marriage vows , if they had waited , theycould have been respectably married in due course . But fate had gone against them . Their child was conceived just before the bomb intended for the Duke had destroyed her lover , leaving her desolate forever  --  and with a double burdenfor to her grief was added shame . She could not endure it , nor would her grandmother . She had no notion how she was going to fend for herself and the child , and the river had seemed an easy solution . " You must never do that again , " I told her . " You 'll find a way . We all do . " " You 're all right . . . " " I . . . I have n't a husband to go to . " " Oh , so you 're a widow ? That 's sad . But you have money I suppose . Most people who come to Dr. Kleine 's have . Ido n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in half-drowned and they were scolding me about havingdone harm to my child he said he would take me in here and look after me. "  | " That was kind of him . But I have n't any money either . I shall have to support myself and my child . I may be teaching English at a convent . " " You are accomplished . I have nothing to recommend me . I 'm just a simple girl . " " What is your name ? " " Gretchen , " she said . " Gretchen Swartz . " " I 'll come and see you again , Gretchen , " I said . " We 'll talk to each other . We 'll discuss what you can do when you have a child and no money . I 'm sure there 's always a way . " " You will come back then ? " she said . I promised . We talked for some time and when I left her I had forgotten about the women on the lawn . Dr. Kleine came to see me later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everything seemed to be going well . He thought the birth was imminent and we must be prepared for that . I slept well and the next morning I felt comparatively well . After I had breakfasted in my own room I put on my loose dressing gown and went to the window and there were the women on the lawn again . I immediately thought of Gretchen Swartz and decided to go along and talk to her . I found my way to her room . I mounted the stairs and knocked . There was no answer so I opened the door and looked in . There was no one there . The bed was made , and there was an impersonal look about it . The floor was highly polished , the window slightly open ; the room looked as though it had been prepared for the next occupant . Disappointed I went back to my room . Then it occurred to me that Gretchen must have been taken somewhere to have her baby . Perhaps at that very moment it was being born . I sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could not get poor Gretchen out of my mind . That afternoon my pains started and for the second time in a very brief period I suffered tragedy . I can remember the agony . I can remember thinking : It will all be worth while when I have my child . . . everything . . . everything . I lost consciousness and when I was aware again I was no longer in pain . " How is she ? " I heard a voice say . There was no answer . My first thought was for my child , and I held up my arms . Someone was bending over me . I said : " My baby ... " There was no answer . Then from a long way off I heard someone say : " Shall she be told ? " And somebody else said : " Wait . " I was terribly frightened . I tried to cling to consciousness but it had gone again . Dr. Kleine was at my bedside . Ilse was with him . I saw Dr. Carlsberg too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was for the best , " she said . " In the circumstances . " " What ? " I cried . " My dear Helena , in view of everything you will see in time . . . it will be easier . " I could not endure the terrible fear . I must know the truth . " Where is my child ? " I cried . " The child , " said Dr. Kleine , " was born dead . " " Nor ' " Yes , dear , " said use tenderly . " All the horror , all the anxiety . It was inevitable . "  | " But I wanted my child . I wanted my little . . . was it a boy ? " It was a girl , " said use . I saw her so clearly  --  my little daughter . I could see her in a little silk dress  --  aged one , aged two  --  and then growing up and going to school . I felt the tears on my cheeks . " She was alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she was so lively . I used to feel her there . Oh no , there is some mistake. 1 ) r . Carlsberg bent over me . " The shock of everything , " he said , " was too much for you . We expected this . Please , d  --  not fret . Remember that you are free now to live a happy lilt . A happy life ! I wanted to scream at them . My lover you tell me never existed . I dreamed of my marriage . But the child was there  --  a living thing and now you tell me she is dead . Ilse said : " We will take care of you , Helena . . . I wanted to cry out : " I do n't need taking care of . I want my child . How dare you experiment with me ! How dare you give me dreams that are without reality ! If I have ken abused I want to know it . There is nothing worse than uncertainty . Oh , yes , there is . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been my consolation has been taken from me . I lay there limply . I had not known such desolation since they had told me that Maximilian , whom I had believed to be my husband , was a myth . I was very weak , they told me . I must not leave my bed . 1 slid not feel physically weak , only mentally exhausted and In deep despair . All these months I had lived for my child . I had made a dream in which Maximilian came back to me and proudly I showed him the child . I had believed that , just as I had uls ays really believed in those three days of perfect happiness . It was only when use smothered me with her good/ness that I wavered . But I was never convinced . I could not be convinced . " I must see my child , " I said . Dr. Kleine was horrified . " It would increase your distress . " I insisted that I wanted to see my baby . " We were burying her today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It is a simple ceremony , and you must not leave your bed . You have to concentrate on getting well now . " I repeated that I wanted to see my child. use came to see me . " Helena , dear , " she said , " it is allover . What you have to do now is forget . You can go back toyour home . You can forget all this . . . nightmare . In a little while it will be as though it never happened . You are so young . " I said stonily : " It will never be as though it has not happened . Nothing that can possibly happen to me will ever be so real , so important to me as this . Do you think I can ever forget ? " " That is not what Dr. Carlsberg wants . His object has been achieved . Now he would like you to go back to nor-mality . " " Dr. Carlsberg is too glib with his dream-producing drugs . I want to see my baby . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Are you trying to tell me that I have given birth to some monster ? " " Certainly not . A little girl , who was born dead . " " I was so much aware of her alive . " " It was a difficult birth . All that you had suffered .. . and you suffered far more than you realized . . . has taken its toll . This is what the doctors feared . In such circumstances it is much better so . " I said : " They are going to bury my baby today . I must see her before they do so . " " It would be better . . . I raised myself on my elbow . I cried : " I will not bep125told any more what I must do . I will not be the victim of your experiments . " use looked frightened . " I will speak to the doctors , " she said . They put me in a wheel chair because the doctor would not allow me to walk . I was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trestles ; the venetian blinds had been arranged so that a little light came through the slats . And there she lay  --  my little baby  --  a small pinched face framed by a little white bonnet . I wanted to pick her up , to hold her to me , to breathe life into that limp little body . Hot tears were in my eyes and bitter despair in my heart . They wheeled me silently back to my room . They put me to bed ; they smoothed my pillows and tucked in the bedclothes , they did everything they could to comfort me , but there was no comfort . I lay in my bed ; I could hear the voices of the women on the lawn . It was over . The dream and the nightmare . I was not yet nineteen years old and I felt I had had a greater experience than many people encountered in a lifetime. use was with me every day . She constantly stressed the fact that I was free now . I could take up my life again as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would take me back to England : and there I would find everything was as it had been . It was the best thing for me . I thought about it a good deal and I could see that it was what I should have to do . I had to grow away from this mad adventure . I had to forget . I would have to start again . I stayed in Dr. Kleine 's nursing home for two weeks and it was almost when I was on the point of leaving  --  so imniersedin my own tragedy had I been  --  that I remembered Gretchen Swartz . I told use how I had found her sobbing in her room andp126use said she would ask the doctor or Mrs. Kleine about the girl . It was the doctor who mentioned her to me . " You were asking about Gretchen Swartz . So you had a word with her ? Did she tell you her story ? " " Yes , poor girl . She was very unhappy . " " She did n't come through . She died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And what happened to the boy ? " " Her family took him . The old grandmother will look after him and then he will go to an uncle . " " Poor Gretchen ! I was so sorry for her . " " Now you are going to stop being sorry . You are going to get well and Frau Gleiberg tells me that in a few weeks ' time she will be taking you back to your home . " He seemed almost gleeful . I had an impression that he had ticked my name off a list . A difficult case which had been satisfactorily settled . And then I felt the tears pricking my eyelids  --  they had come very easily in the last few days  --  and I was weeping for the loss of my dream and my child.  |p128A  month after I had looked on that little dead face Ilse took me back to England . How normal everything seemed . If ever I could grow to believe that I had imagined the whole incredible adventure , I could do it there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future and the theme of her discourse was : Forget . The sooner I did this the sooner I should begin to lead a new life . She did not see it as I had seen it . To her it was a horrible misadventure with a climax she could only regard as fortunate . Death , she would say , had solved my problems . She did not know that the ecstatic memory of three days with Maximilian lived on ; she did not understand that while a child lives within its mother , love is born . But I could see that she was right about putting it all behind me . I had to go on living . I had to pick up the threads of my life . Ilse stayed with us only a few days , then she said good/bye . I fancied there was a certain relief in her attitude . Perhaps she was regretting that she had asked me to accompanyher and Ernst on that day some ten months ago , but when I saw her off at the station she made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting on and she seemed as concerned as ever . Everyone agreed that I had changed . I knew that they were right . Gone was the gay effervescent girl ; in her place was a rather withdrawn woman . I looked older too  --  older than my nineteen years whereas before I had looked younger than my age . There were changes at home . Aunt Caroline was slightly different . She had always been critical of society , now she was angry with it . No one seemed right to her ; Aunt Matilda came in for a good deal of castigation but I very soon became the butt for it . What I had thought I was doing gallivanting about for nearly a year , she did not know . Improving my German ! English was good enough for her and should have been for anyone . I 'd come back bone idle , as far as she could see . Had I any new recipes to tell her ? Not that she would want a lot of foreign ways of cooking in her kitchen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hearing a thing she said . As for Aunt Matilda , she had changed . Bodily ailments still supplied her main excitement but she had become very friendly with the Cleeses in the bookshop . " What I wonder , " said Aunt Caroline sarcastically , " is why you do n't go and live there . " " You know , Helena , " Aunt Matilda confided in me , " when you think of all there is to do in the shop they do n't get much time for seeing to things about the rooms above it . Amelia 's chest is n't what it should be and when you consider Mr. Clees ' one kidney trying to do the work of two it makes you think . " She was happier than she had been when I left and I grew quite fond of her . She was always smuggling in mendingfrom the Cleeses ' house so that Aunt Caroline wouldn'tp130see it . She would sit in her room secretly doing it . It was what Aunt Caroline would call " making yourself cheap . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner within a few days of my return . Mrs. Greville embraced me warmly . " My dear Helena ! " she said . " Why you 've grown thinner ! " And she took my face in her hands and looked at it with such close scrutiny that I felt myself flushing . " Is everything all right , Helena ? " " Why yes , of course . " " You 've changed . " " I 'm a year older . " " It 's more than that . " She looked rather worried so I kissed her and said : " I have n't settled in properly yet . " " Oh , your aunts , " she said with a little grimace . Then she added : " Anthony 's so pleased you 're back . We all are . " It was a happy evening . They were delighted by my return . They kept asking questions about my sojourn and I tried to evade them when they touched on my personal experiences . I told them some of the legends of the forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These have come from the pre-Christian era , " he said . " I believe some of the beliefs still linger . " " I 'm sure they do , " I said , and I was back in the square watching the dancers and I saw a figure in the homed headdress and I heard a tender voice whisper : " Lenchen Liebchen . " Anthony was looking at me strangely . I must have betrayedsomething . I warned myself to be careful . So I tried to be very gay and described how the girls dressed on feast days in their satin aprons with bright kerchiefs tied over their heads . Anthony knew something of this because he had visited the Black Forest with his parents before he went to college . He had been fascinated even as I had . Yes , it was a pleasant evening but that night I was disturbed by dreams . Maximilian was in them and so was thep131child , and strangely enough it was not of a dead baby in a coffin I dreamed but of a living child . The dreams were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into deep melancholy . This is how it will be throughout my life , I thought . The days passed slowly at first but because one week was so much like another they merged and began to fly . There were the household duties to be performed under Aunt Caroline 's never satisfied authority ; there were the occasional visits of friends ; sometimes I went into the bookshop and helped when they were busy . I began to acquire a certain knowledge of books . Aunt Matilda , who managed to be there quite often too , was always pleased to see me there . I t was such a help for Amelia with her chest and Albert with his solitary kidney . Aunt Caroline was not so pleased by the friendship . " What you see in that place , I ca n't imagine , " she grumbled . " If they sold something sensible I might understand it more . Books ! What are they but time wasters . " During the first year of my return , use had written several times . Then there came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be leaving Denkendorf . I sent my condolences and expected to be given a new address but I never had another letter from use . I waited and waited hilt the years passed and there was nothing . It seemed very strange when I remembered how close we had been . My dreams continued to disturb my nights and haunt my days . Time could do nothing to efface my memories. i those dreams my baby lived  --  a little girl who so resembledMaximilian that she was clearly his daughter . As the time passed she grew up in my dreams . I yearned for the child ; and when I awoke after one of my vivid dreamssuffered the loss of my baby afresh . We lived perpetually under the cloud of Aunt Caroline 's displeasure , and one day when I had been home for a little more than a year she was not up at her usual time and when I went to her room I found her in bed unable to move . She had had a stroke . She recovered a little and I nursed her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was an exacting patient ; nothing pleased her . Those were three dreary years when I would drop into my bed exhausted every night to dream . And how I dreamed ! My memories were as vivid as ever . I well remember the day when Aunt Matilda whispered to me that she was going to marry Albert Glees . " I mean , " she said blushing coyly , " where is the sense of my keep going in and out . I might just as well live there . " " " It 's only a step or two next door , " I reminded her . " Oh but it 's not the same . " She was bubbling over with excitement like a young bride . I was happy for her because she had changed so much . Happiness suited Aunt Matilda . " When 's the great day to be ? " I asked . " Oh , I have n't told Caroline yet . " " When Caroline was told she was very angry . She talked continually of the folly of old women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning the collars and cuffs of their shirts . What did they think they were going to get out of that ! " The satisfaction of helping someone perhaps , " I suggested . " Now , Helena , there 's no need for you to come into this . If Matilda likes to make a fool of herself let her . " " I do n't see that she 's making a fool of herself by helping Mr. Glees . " " Perhaps you do n't , but I do . You 're too young to understandthese things . " Too young ! Beside Aunt Caroline I felt old in experience . If she but knew ! I thought . If I said to her : But I have been a wife and mother , what would she make of my implausible tale ? One thing I was sure of : She must never get a chance to make anything of it . And that started the yearning again . Indeed everything seemed to lead back to it . When Aunt Matilda ceremoniously brought Mr. Gleesp133into the house , Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I had noticed the hot color in her cheeks and the way the veins knotted at her temples . I said that we ought to drink to the health and happiness of the affianced couple and without Aunt Caroline 's permissionI took out a bottle of her best elderberry wine and served it . It was rather pleasant to see Aunt Matilda looking ten years younger and I wondered , with a return of my old frivolity , whether she would have fallen in love with Albert Clees if he had not been deprived of a kidney . Amelia was pleased too . She whispered to me that she had seen it coming for a long time and that it was the best thing that could happen to her father . The wedding was to be soon , for as Matilda said , there was no sense in waiting . Mr. Glees gallantly added that he had waited long enough , which made Aunt Matilda blush prettily . When the Cleeses had left Aunt Caroline let forth a burst of scorn and abuse . " Some people thought they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Aunt Matilda . " And what 's the difference ? " " Two years , " said Aunt Matilda spiritedly . " Making fools of themselves ! I suppose there 'll be a white wedding with bridesmaids in wreaths of rosebuds . " " No , Albert thinks a quiet wedding would be best . " " He 's got sense enough to realize you do n't want to make fools of yourself parading in white then . " " Albert has a lot of sense , more than some I could name . " And so it went on . Aunt Matilda , who had become " Matty " named thus by her devoted Albert , was excited about her wedding dress . " Soft brown velvet , " she said . " Jenny Withers will make it.  |p134Albert  will come with me to choose the material . And a brown hat with pink roses . " " Pink roses at your time of life ! " snapped Aunt Caroline . " If you marry that man you 'll sup sorrow with a long spoon . " But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amelia would come in and we would huddle together looking at patterns for the wedding dress and for Amelia 's gray silk which was being made for the occasion . Amelia was to be matron of honor . We would all be laughing together when we would hear Aunt Caroline 's stick outside the door ( she had walked with a stick since her stroke for one leg was useless ) . Then she would come in and say nothing but sit regarding us all with contempt . But she could not spoil Matilda 's happiness , although on the wedding day she refused to attend the ceremony . " You can all go and make fools of yourselves if you want to , " she said . " I sha n't . " So Aunt Matilda was married and the wedding breakfast was held in the rooms over the shop with just a few guests . Aunt Caroline stayed at home muttering and grumbling about mutton dressed up as lamb and people in their second childhood . Two days after the wedding she had another stroke which rendered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , retain her speech which was more venomous than ever . There followed a very melancholy period which seemed to be devoted to the nursing of Aunt Caroline . Aunt Matilda helped , but her first duty was to Albert now and she was a happy wife determined to do her duty . Often when I was preparing a meal for Aunt Caroline , I would dream of a life I had once visualized during three blissful days . I thought of living in a Schloss perched high on a hill , as so many of them I had seen had been ; I thought of a gracious life with a husband whom I adored and who adored me ; I thought too of children  --  my littlep135daughter and a son . There would be a son . And often this seemed more real to me than the kitchen with its rows of bottles neatly labeled by Aunt Caroline and now often put back in the wrong place , until milk boiled over or somethingcaught in the oven to bring me back to reality . During this period there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  not of our church but of another on the outskirts of the town . Mrs. Creville was delighted with her clever son . I knew that she had already seen him in his gaiters presiding over his bishopric. 1 had taken to going to church every Sunday with the ( : rcvilles to hear Anthony take the service , and I felt more contented than I had believed possible . The fact that I did not hear from Ilse added to the sense of unreality and I began to feel that I had strayed into a strange world where events which would seem inconceivable in a logical world had happened . But at night I dreamed my dreams . On Sundays after evensong I would go to the Grevilles ' ! home for Sunday supper while Aunt Matilda or Amelia kept an eye on Aunt Caroline , who was more and more needing constant attention , and it was on one of the summer Sundayswhen supper had been cleared away that Anthony asked me to go for a walk with him . It was a lovely evening and we strolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he loved to do about the glories of Oxford . Ile loved to discover the history of the place and like my father he knew how all the colleges had been founded . On this particular Sunday he was telling me about the legend of St. Frideswyde , which he said was something more than a legend . Frideswyde had actually lived and in the year 727 founded a nunnery . When the King of Leicester fell madly In love with her and tried to abduct her he was struck blind . She lived so piously that when she died a shrine was dedicated to her . About this shrine first a hamlet grew up , then a village and so began the ancient town of Oxford . There the owners of cattle drove them across the ford wherep136the Thames and Cherwell met and thus the spot derived its name of Oxford . He was so enthusiastic when he talked he grew quite animated which he was not in the normal way , and I was taken by surprise when he said suddenly : " Helena , will you marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had ever doubted it I knew in that moment that I considered myself to be a married woman . It was so long since I had seen Ilse 's kind face . It was so long since I had heard from her , that her image had faded and with it my fears that she , Ernst and Dr. Carlsberg must have been right . The farther I grew away from that time the more vivid seemed my adventure in the forest and the less plausible their account of my lost days . But marry ! I was already married . " Helena , is the idea so repulsive to you ? " " Oh no , " I said . " No , no . It was just that I had n't thought . " I stopped . How foolish this must seem . Of course it had been obvious for some time what Anthony 's intentions were . The attitude of Mr. and Mrs. Greville had made it clear . I realized with dismay that they were expecting us to come back from our walk engaged . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm fond of you . " Yes , I was fond of him . I liked Anthony Greville as much as anyone in Oxford . I found his conversation interesting , I enjoyed his company . I should be very lonely if he went out of my life . But I wanted to go on as we were . It was his friendship I wanted . There was only one man whom I could consider as my husband and I believed he was that in spite of efforts to convince me that I loved a phantom . " It 's just that I had n't thought of marriage , " I finished lamely . " I should have led up to this , I suppose , " he said ruefully . " I know my parents expect it . They are so fond of you and so am I. " I said : " It would be very suitable of course but ... "  | " Oh , Helena , " he said , " get used to the idea . Think about it . " " There is Aunt Caroline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She needs someone to look after her all the time . " " We could bring her to the vicarage . My mother would ' help to look after her . " " I could n't impose Aunt Caroline on you . She would disruptthe household . " I was talking round the matter , anything but to tell the truth . I was really agitated because talking of marriage had brought back so vividly that room in the hunting lodge , the Priest with the book and the ring , and Maximilian standing beside me impatiently waiting for the time when we wouldbe alone . I forced myself to think of Anthony . He would be kind to me ; we could have a pleasant life together . I could be of use to him in his work ; perhaps we should have children . I felt the pain surging within me as I thought of that little face framed in the white bonnet . How could I possibly marry without telling what had happened to me  --  now six years ago . I said quickly : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile took my hand and pressed it firmly . " But of course , " he said . We were thoughtful as we went back to the house . I could not tear my mind away from the past . I kept seeing Maximilian with the eager passion in his eyes . I had had no doubts then ; I would have made no excuses ; I would have swept them all away . And my child . . . I could not bear it . I must control my feelings . When we arrived back at the house I noticed at once the expectancy in Mrs. Greville 's face . She was disappointed . Anthony had now moved into the new vicarage , a charmingQueen Anne residence with spacious , gracious lawns at both front and back . There was a south wall at the back  --  older than the house . It had been there since Tudor days.  |p138Peaches  could be grown on it . There were apple and pear trees in the garden and a sundial inscribed with an old adage " I count only the sunny hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the only ones which should be counted . " His parents had moved in with him . " To make sure of his comforts , " Mrs. Greville explained to me . " Of course when Anthony marries we 'll be ready to take a back seat . " She spoke significantly . I knew she thought that although I was hesitant I should eventually marry Anthony . After all , what life was there for me otherwise ? It was n't right , said Mrs. Greville , for young women to be cooped up looking after old ones . She implied that Aunt Caroline would be no less miserable installed in a room in the vicarage where she would help to look after her . They were so good , so kind , and I loved them all dearly . Why did I hesitate ? The answer was because I was clinging to a dream . Either in reality or my dreams I had known the perfect union and I hungered for it . I knew that Anthony was a good man ; it seemed very likely that Maximilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love people for their virtues . One day when we were in the walled garden , and I was alone with Anthony , I blurted out : " Anthony , I want to be absolutely truthful with you . I 've had a child . " He was startled and incredulous . " You remember I was away for almost a year . It 's the strangest story and the strangest part of it is that I do n't know whether or not it 's true . " I told him what had happened beginning with my adventurein the mist and the strong feelings that had been aroused in me that night . I wanted to keep nothing back . And then I went on to my adventure on the Night of the Seventh Moon . " Everything was normal until then  --  and the rest .. . Anthony , I am not sure . "  |p139Ile  listened intently . " It seems incredible , " he said . " I should like to meet your cousin . " " She was so good to me . She felt responsible .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during those months .. . Then she ceased to write . " " Some people are bad correspondents . " " But I should have thought she would have sent an address . Anthony , what do you think happened ? " " I know , " he said , " that doctors are making rapid advancesin this field and that experiments have been made . It must have been that this Dr. Carlsberg used such an experiment on you , with what results we have seen . " " Is it possible to forget six whole days of your life ? " " I believe it is . " " And then . . . this horrible thing happened to me .. . and I can not remember it . " " It is better that you do n't . It seems that this was necessary to save you pain , humiliation , and perhaps great mental stress which could have been dangerous . " t " I can see that you believe the marriage to have been a " myth . " " If it were not so where is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did he give a false name , a name that you had seen was one of the Duke 's titles . Besides , why should your cousin lie to you ? Why should the doctor do so ? " " Why indeed ? Everything points one way . You as a practicalman see that . " " My poor Helena , " he said , " it was a shattering experience . But it is over now . The child died so any complications which might have ensued have been removed . " I closed my eyes . I could not bear it when anyone talked of my child 's death as this happy release . " I wanted the child , " I said fiercely . " I would not have eared for these complications . " " You will have other children , Helena . That is the best way to heal that wound . "  | How calm he was , how kind , how unshaken in his love for me . I knew that I had told him this because the prospect of marriage with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had told him . It was a great relief . I began to think how comforting it would be in the future to share my troubles with him.  |p141The  more I thought of marriage with Anthony the more rational it seemed . Anthony 's calm reception of my revelationhad shown me what a steadying influence he would have on my life ; he was a man in whom I knew I could put my trust . Marriage with him would be like coming into a safe harbor after battling against the storms . On the very next Sunday he preached an eloquent sermon about the need to overcome past misfortunes , never to brood on what could not be altered but to try to profit from experience rather than to regret it . His text came from the story of the houses one of which was built on sand , the other on rock ; and the shifting sands of romantic dreams were doomed to destruction while the house which was built on the firm rock of reality would endure . I was so moved by that sermon that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet that very night my dreams were as vivid as ever and I awoke to find myself calling for Maximilian . I found I could talk of my experience with Anthony morefreely than I had ever believed possible . It was a pleasure to bring it out into the open . We discussed it at greatlength and went over every detail . He missed nothing ; buthe remained firm to his conclusion that I had been the victimof Dr. Carlsberg 's experiment and he believed that the doctor had been right to make it . Mrs. Greville was constantly busy helping with the work of the parish . " My goodness , " she used to say , " a man in Anthony 's position ca n't get along without a woman to help him in his parish duties . " She was just a little impatient with me . She once reminded me that I was no longer a young girl . I was nearly twenty-six . No longer young . People would soon be saying I was on the shelf . How I should have enjoyed pleasing them ! As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was indefatigable in the organization of the sales of work , and social evenings . I made cups of tea which were distributed at the mothers ' meetings . " You have a flair for the work , " said Mrs. Greville significantly . Between my constant visits to the vicarage and the work I did and my occasional spells in the bookshop besides looking after Aunt Caroline , the time flew . Aunt Caroline grudged every minute I was away from the house . " Chasing after the vicar , " she used to say . " I do n't know . Some people are man-mad . " She hated my going out but Aunt Matty insisted . She was very excited about my relationship with Anthony . She was so happy in her marriage that she would have liked to see everyone about her in the same blissful state  --  Amelia , myself , and even Aunt Caroline.  |p143She  always came to the house while I was away . " Now you go and enjoy yourself , " she would say . Then she thought it pleasant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're better than anyone in the foreign departmentand it 's amazing how many foreigners we get in . " So the time flew past . There was never a moment to spare , and all the time at the back of my mind  --  and often to the fore of it  --  was the question : Could I be happy married to Anthony ? Could I make him happy ? Should I , if I married , cease to be haunted by nostalgic dreams ? I could see a very happy life ahead of me . Anthony 's quiet charm would have been enhanced by a wife who had the enthusiasm I knew I could muster and once my old high spirits returned I would be a useful foil . Oh yes , I would tell myself again and again , it would be ideal . Aunt Caroline continued to complain : " Gadding about ! Running after Anthony Greville . Hoping he 'll marry you , I suppose . Making yourself cheap . " I wanted to shout at her : He has asked me ; but I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was to have a stall at the sale of work and had been collecting for weeks to fill it . Members of the church sent in their donations . One parcel came containing half a dozen egg cozies from the Misses Edith and Rose Elkington . I stared at the name for some seconds , and then I was back in the narrow street with the cobbled road , the overhangingsigns ; I was standing outside Dr. Kleine 's clinic and my body was heavy with my lively unborn child . Two women had spoken to me on that occasion . Yes , it had been the Misses Elkington . They sold teas and coffees , homemade cakes and homemade knickknacks like tea cozy covers and egg covers . I shivered and felt vaguely apprehensive . I was right to feel so . On the first afternoon of the sale of work they were there . Two pairs of bright eyes regarded me . They were like monkeys ' eyes  --  dark , living , curious.  | " Why it 's Miss Helena Trant . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Thank you . They are very useful . " " I hope you like the red and green combination , " said the younger . I said I thought it was most effective . The elder of the two said : " Did n't we see you in Germany ? " " Oh . . . yes , I believe you did . " " You 'd gone out with your cousin I believe and stayed quite a long time . " " Yes , that 's right . " " Interesting , " said the elder , and I did not much like the gleam in her eye . It made me more uneasy . Aunt Caroline worked herself up into a fury that night . Matilda had come in and hurried off early because she was worried about Albert . You had to be careful with one kidney , she kept saying . I was late back . I had had quite a success with my stall and by the time I had added up the takings and packed away the unsold goods and gone back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Caroline screamed at me when I came home . She really looked very wild , her hair in disorder , her face flushed . She had been knocking on the floor with her stick for the last half an hour . No one had answered . Our maid Ellen was a lazy good-for-nothing , she declared ; Matilda was besottedabout that man next door ; Amelia had gone to some concert ; and I , of course , was busy chasing Anthony Greville . No one had spared a thought for her , but that was how it was when you were ill . People were so selfish . She went on and on and I was afraid for her because the doctor had said that she must not become excited . He had given me some pills which should have a calming effectp145but when I suggested she take one , she cried : " That 's right , blame it on to me . I 'm the one who has to calm down . 1 have to keep quiet . I must n't say a word . You all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First Matilda  --  Matty she calls herself now . Matty indeed ! She 's gone back to her second childhood . And as for you . You 're brazen you are . I wonder the vicar ca n't see through you . Well , you 're not a girl any more , are you ? You 're getting a bit worried . You 're going to be left on the shelf if you do n't watch out . But nobody could say you 're not watching out . On the prowl I 'd say . " I cried : Be quiet , Aunt Caroline . You 're talking non-sense . " " Nonsense . Nonsense that 's as plain as the nose on your face . Nonsense indeed ! Anyone with half an eye can see what you 're after . " I was goaded beyond endurance and I said : " As a matter of fact Anthony has asked me to marry him . " I saw her face change , and I knew then that this was what she feared , and suddenly I saw clearly what her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more simple nature ; Matilda had been interested in her invalids and sympathetic toward them : there was no sympathy in Aunt Caroline 's nature . She had been the less attractive of the two sisters . She was the eldest of the family . My father had come in between . She had had to stand aside for him and envy had eaten into her soul . I saw it there on her face  --  envy of my father for whom sacrifices had had to be made , for Matilda , who had made other people 's ailments her interest and who had now found a new life in her marriage ; myself as she thought about to marry . Poor Aunt Caroline , robbed of everything : the education my father had had , the husband Matilda had ; and in addition she was an invalid . I felt deeply sorry for her . Envy  --  that deadliest of the seven sins  --  had etched those bitter lines about her mouth , had tightenedit and set the sneering glitter in her eyes . Poor , poor Aunt Caroline.  |p146I  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to be patient . " Aunt Caroline , " I began , " I . . " But she was groping for her pills . I took one and put it into her mouth . I said . " You had better rest now . I am here if you want anything . " She nodded ; and that night she died . No one could mourn her . Her passing could only be what was aptly and so commonly known as " a happy release . " " Her condition could only have worsened , " said the doctor . Aunt Matilda reverted to type and talked endlessly about hearts which were such funny things but were going to get you in the end . I should sleep next door until after the funeral , she said . Mrs. Greville immediately invited me to the vicarage , but I had already accepted Aunt Matilda 's offer . So I slept in the room which had been mine as a very small child before my father had acquired the house next door . There was that bustling which funerals always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ultimate climax to illness were a matter of great interest to her . Everything must be done in a manner which she considered " right . " Black had to be ordered and made at great speed ; as chief mourner Aunt Matilda assumed a great importance . I was next and we should go together ; she would lean on my arm and I would have to support her . Tears were necessary on such an occasion and it was very strange , she told me , that some people did not always find it easy to shed them . One must not speak ill of the dead ( an important point in funeral etiquette ) but Aunt Caroline had been very ill and it was hard to regret her death . If tears should prove difficult , and she knew that I was by no means an easy shedder of them ( " You never were , " she confided . " It was something to do with being sent away from home when you werep147young " ) she had heard a peeled onion concealed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought how life had changed for her since Mr. Glees had come along , and that she was a much pleasanter person than she had been under the sway of Aunt Caroline and a participator in the perpetualbickering that seemed inevitable . Marriage had been a blessing for her . And for me ? I believed it would be the same . The black arrived . Aunt Matilda was not pleased with Amelia 's hat ; her own with its jet brooch and dead black satin ribbons was a triumph . There were the wreaths which caused great consternation lest they should arrive too late . Aunt Matilda could not bear the thought of her sister 's being carried to her last resting place without the " Gates of Heaven Ajar " which she and Albert were contributing . In our little drawing room the coffin stood on trestles ; there was a funeral smell throughout the house . The blinds were drawn in all rooms and our little maid Ellen had gone home to her mother because she coud n't face spending the nights alone in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The solemn black-clad top-hatted men walking beside the black velvet caparisoned horses provided mournful solemnity and the necessary pall of gloom had been arranged even to Aunt Matilda 's complete satisfaction . Then back to the rooms over the shop to partake of funeral meats . Cold ham , Aunt Matilda said , was a necessity . At one funeral she had been given cold chicken , which in her opinion showed a certain levity out of keeping with the occasion . The evening came . " You should stay here one more night , " said Aunt Matilda . So I did , and in my little room that night , I thought : I should marry Anthony.  | Just as I had almost made up my mind something happened to make me hesitate . Ellen came back after the funeral looking very thoughtful . She was absentminded and during the second day I asked if there was anything wrong . " Oh , Miss Helena , " she said , " I do n't know whether or not to tell you . " " Well , if you think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , miss . It 's . . . it 's you . " " What do you mean , Ellen ? " " It 's you and the vicar , and I do n't believe it and I do n't think I should repeat it . . . but perhaps you ought to know . I 'm sure it 's just wicked gossip . " " Do tell me . " " Well my mum had it from someone who had been in their shop and she said there was a lot of people there and they were all saying it was shocking and that the vicar ought to be told . .. " " But what , Ellen ? " " I hardly like to say , miss . They 're saying that when you went away all that time it was because you was in trouble and that you had a baby . " I stared at her . " Who said this , Ellen ? " " It started with them Miss Elkingtons . They said they saw you there . . . and it was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered it all so clearly : the little street ; the exultationI had felt because my child would soon be born ; four curious monkey-like eyes regarding me intently . " It 's nonsense , I know , miss . But I thought you ought to know . " " Oh , yes , " I said , " I ought to know . You did right to tell me . " Well , there 's nothing to it but gossip . I know that , miss . So does anybody who knows you . Them Miss Elkingtons is terrible gossips . My mum says that 's what they 've got ap149slop for . Miss , when you get married , you 'll be wanting someone up there and as I know your ways ... " I said : " I 'll remember , Ellen . " I wanted to get to my room and think . Of course , I said to myself , I ca n't marry Anthony . The Elkingtons would always be there to gossip . What a horrible sordid story ! I had gone abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live that down . Like Caesar 's wife , the vicar 's must be beyond reproach . I told Anthony what Ellen had told me . He brushed it aside . " My dear , we 'd live that down . " " But it 's true . I was pregnant when they saw me and it was obvious . I did have a child . " " My dear Helena , that 's in the past . " " I know and with you I should be building the house on the rock . But it 's not fair to you . A scandal like that could ruin your career . It could prevent your progress . " " I 'd rather have a wife than a bishopric . " " I might fail you . " I frowned . I remembered the emotions Maximilian had stirred in me during that night in the mist . I remembered the slow turning of the door handle . If the door had . opened , what then ? I believed that I should have found him irresistible . What if by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be my feelings for him that he would have the power to wreck that house  --  built on a rock though it might be . Again I took refuge in prevarication . " I must think , " I said . " This has changed things in a way . He would n't agree , but I insisted . It was at this time that I decided to write down what had happened to me in order that I might come to some conclusion as to what actually occurred on the Night of the Seventh Moon . But I must confess that when I came to this point I was no nearer to the truth than I had been before.  |p150I  put the account away so that I would always have a record of it and as the years passed I could relive that time of my life in detail . But it was not long after this when I again stepped into that fantastic world and then I made up my mind that I would write down my adventures as they happened so that they would be clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So when I once more arrived in the Lokenwald I started to record my adventures as soon as they began to happen.  |p152With  Aunt Caroline dead , life became calmer , giving one greater opportunity for reflection . How peaceful it was ! I would hear Ellen singing as she worked . The days were full . I worked regularly at the bookshop which I found very interesting . When I was not working there I was helping with church affairs , but the Elkingtons had spoiled that for me and I was always apprehensive about meeting them . So I gave my attention to the shop and it was there that I encounteredFrau Graben . She came in one day  --  a comfortable , plump , middle-aged woman with streaks of gray in her wispy hair which escaped from under a plain felt hat . She was dressed in a rather dowdy brown-and-gray check traveling coat over a skirt of the same material . I was talking to Amelia and she made straight for us . She said in a halting English with an accent which madep153my heart beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vant IssI immediately spoke to her in German and the effect was miraculous . Her plump face lighted up , her eyes shone and she answered volubly in her own language . In the space of a few minutes she told me that she was visiting England mid that she spoke very little English  --  both of which facts were fairly obvious  --  and that she wanted a little book whichcould help her to understand the language . I took her along to the German section in the foreign department , telling her that I had a phrase book she would find useful and I thought that a dictionary would be of great help . She made the purchases and thanked me , but seemed loath to go and as we were not busy I was quite happy to talk with her . She had arrived only a few days ago in England and had come to Oxford because a friend of hers had been educated there . She wanted to see the place of which she had heard so much . Was she enjoying England ? I asked . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficulty . She felt lonely and she could not tell me how wonderful it was to find someone who could talk to her as I could . I found myself explaining to her that my mother was Bavarian and that she used to talk to me in her native tongue , and that I had been educated in a Damenstift near I eichenkin . The joy in her face was expressive . But that was wonderful . She knew the Damenstift well . It was not so far from where she lived . This was better than ever . After half an hour she left , but the next day she was back again and made a further purchase . Again she stayed to talk . She looked so wistful when she was about to walk out of the shop that I asked her to tea next day . She arrived at the expected time and I took her into the little sitting room which seemed so much more gay nowp154that Aunt Caroline was dead . Ellen brought in the tea and some cakes which she had made . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither of us cared for that . The conversation was exciting , because Frau Graben knew the forest well . She told me that she lived in a small Schloss perched on the mountainside and here she was the Schlossmutter . She was in charge of the household and was the children 's chief nurse . She was indeed the mother . She proudly told me that she was responsible for the management of the Schloss . The children to whom she referred with affection were Dagobert , Fritzi , and Liesel . " Whose children are they ? " I asked . " They 're the Count 's . " I felt dizzy with an excitement which had grown greater ever since I had met Frau Graben . " Count . . . ? " I reiterated . " Well , " she said . " He 's the Duke 's nephew and a gay young gentleman he is too . Many people thought he was mixed up in his father 's plotting . But now Count Ludwig has gone there 's still my lord Count and no one can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What of the Countess ? " " She 's a suitable wife for him and they have one son . " " I thought you said there were three children ? " " I 'm not actually in the Count 's household . I have nothing to do with that son . " She shrugged her shoulders . " You know how it is . . . But perhaps you do n't . My lord was always after the women ; Ludwig was the same . It runs in the family . They used to say that Ludwig was the father of a good many more than he owned to . And , my goodness , you can see the family features in the little ones playing about in the villages . " " And these three ? " " He admits to them . Special favorites their mothers must have been . And the Count likes any connected with him to be well looked after . He 's fond of them in his way andp155comes to see them now and then . He takes an interest in their future . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal family of England he wants them all taughti Iglish . " " This Count , " I said , " what is he like ? " " lle 's like all the family  --  tall and good-looking , and fond of his own way . No woman 's safe once he 's taken a fancy to her . Yes , he 's just like all the family . I was nurse to them so 1 know and I reckon that nursery was as difficult to controlas a whole dukedom . The mischief those boys got into ! I had my hands full , I did . And in their mid-teens it was the women they were after . But I will say this . He looked after the children . It 's my belief that many a girl puts her trouble down to his door . He 's careless . He 'll see she 's all right . He likes his fun , he says , and does n't mind paying for it . The children think he 's wonderful . Young Dagobert will grow up Just like him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something different about Fritzi . I worry about him . He needs a mother and of course that 's just what he has n't got ? " " Where is his mother ? " " She 's dead , I daresay . But the mothers would n't come to the Schloss in any case . Once he 's done with a woman lie 's done with her . But I will say he takes an interest in the children . He did n't like the way some of the family could n't speak English with the Queen 's party when she came visiting us from England after her husband 's death . I want the children to learn English , ' he said . So now of course well have a new teacher for them . An English teacher , ' he said . He 's not going to have them talking with a German accent . " " And the Count  --  does he speak English ? " " He 's been educated here . . . in this place . He speaks English like you do . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to have an English teacher . " " Yes , that 's what he aims at . " She went on to tell me about the children . Dagobert was the eldest . He was twelve  --  and boys of twelve can be a handful ; then came Fritzi , short for Fritz . He was ten . He missed his mother . I thought : He would be a year older than my daughter , and the terrible yearning was back with me . " Then there 's Liesel . A haughty little piece she is . Five years old and very much aware of her noble blood even though her mother was a little dressmaker who came to the court to sew . " Again I was being caught up in that fairy-tale atmosphere . The excitement had come back to me in force . I wanted her to go on talking to me about the Schloss on the mountainside that looked down on the valley in which lay the town of Rochenberg , the capital city of Rochenstein , which was ruled over by the Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed a remarkable coincidence that Frau Graben had come into the shop and that I had been there to attend to her , that she had been so eager to talk in her own languagethat she was now sitting drinking tea in this house and bringing back so vividly that romantic adventure which had begun eleven years ago in the mist . As she was leaving she said suddenly , " Now you 're the sort of person we 'd want to teach them English . " I felt a little faint . I stammered : " But I 'm not a teacher . " She went on : " It would have to be an English person . The Count was thinking of a tutor . But I do n't think a woman would be out of place . . . better I think . Women understand children more . I wonder . . . " " I had no intention of teaching , " I said . " You would want somebody qualified . " " He 'd want someone of education , but the main thing is someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could hardly tell it was n't spoken by a native . Yes , I do reckon you 're just the one . " " If I had been looking for such a post . . . " I began . " It would only be for a short time , of course . I do n't knowhow long they 'd take to learn . You love the mountains andp157the pine forests , do n't you ? You 'd live in the Schloss . I 'd be there , as the Schlossmutter . I 'm in charge of the children 's household . There 's something about you ... sympathetic . . that 's it . When the Count talked of having an English tutor I did n't like it at all . I do n't want a man interfering In my household . I 'd like a nice young woman , I thought . list not one of those stern , sharp-voiced English mistresses . Oh no ! I would n't want that . I told the Count so . But my tongue 's running away with me . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps he has already done so . Well , it has been interesting talking to you . " I said : " You must come again . " She held my hand when she said goodbye and there were tears in her eyes , as she thanked me for being kind and taking in the " stranger within my gates . " That night I scarcely slept at all . I was so excited . I thought of the Schloss on the mountain looking down on the capital city and I longed to be there . I knew that I could never settle down happily with Anthony until I had made one great effort to discover the truth of what happened to me on the Night of the Seventh Moon . I asked Fran Graben to tea again , just before she left Oxford . She talked of her home , of the children , of customs and feast days of Rochenstein , of good Duke Carl who was stern and serious , so different from some of the previous rulers and members of his family . She told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussia and I knew , did n't I , that the Crown Princess was Victoria who was named after her mother the Queen of England . I was in a panic because she seemed to have completely forgotten her reference to the English teacher who would be wanted for the Count 's children . I knew that I wanted to go , that this was an opportunity , a flimsy one it was true , and one which had come about as unexpectedly as . . . as the visit of use and Ernst . I had hoped that my cousin would ask me to pay another visit but she never wrote . Perhaps use was not a good letter writer and once she had assured herself that I had settled down after my experience she thought correspondence unnecessary . But she might have answered my letters . It was I who had to make the reference . " I should like to know that you return safely , " I said . " Would you write to me ? I feel you have become a friend and I should like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , that tutor ! " she cried . " I hope he never comes . " She looked at me , her plump face earnest . " Suppose I was to mention our meeting . The Count sets store on my opinion . Would you . . . ? Just suppose he thought it might be a good idea . " She warmed to the subject . " It would save so much trouble . We would have an English woman and there would n't be the fuss of seeing you . I 've done that already . I can think of no one more suitable , from my point of view . I could tell the Count . . . " " I 'd ... I 'd like to think about it . " She nodded . " Well , that 's something . I 'll mention you , and if he has n't done anything , and if he agrees ... " " Well , " I said , trying to keep my voice steady . " You might mention it . " Now I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago since the day I left . Nine years ! I should have made greater efforts to discover what had happened . I had accepted the solution given me by Ilse and Ernst , but they had faded into the past and seemed more unreal than Maximilian could ever be . Perhaps if I could go back I might discover the answer . I must go back . I could take a holiday there perhaps with Anthony . No , that would not do . I should have to go as his wife and I must be free . . . free for whatever I should find . I did not wish to go as a tourist . But to go to the Schlosson the mountainside , looking down on the capital city . . that was what I wanted . I knew then that I must go.  |p159I  lived in a fever of excitement . I was absentminded in the shop . I kept away from the vicarage as much as possible . " You are letting those Elkington women 's gossip bother you , " said Anthony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face anything there was to face together . " But it was not that . I was obsessed by the thought that I might find him . So it would be throughout my life . If ever I had known that marriage with Anthony would be unfair to him and perhaps wrong for me , I knew it now . And at length there was the letter . I was trembling so much that I could scarcely open it . The words danced before my eyes . She had spoken to the Count . He agreed that the idea was excellent and as she had already vetted me there would he no need for any other recommendations . Would I let them know when I should be arriving and the sooner the t better as far as they were concerned . I was so excited I rushed into the shop and told Amelia . " Go away to teach ! You 're crazy . What about Anthony ? " " Nothing has been settled between us . " Aunt Matty was distraught . Just as she had thought I was nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I might not like it . " " Go for a holiday , " advised Amelia . " Take a month or so and when you come back you 'd have made up your mind to marry Anthony . " But what could they know of this violent longing . Mr. and Mrs. Greville were clearly hurt but Anthony understood . " Go , " he said . " This place meant something to you when you were young and impressionable . You 'll see it differently now you 're grown up . You 'll come back and then I 'll be waiting for you . " He understood as no one else could . I did love him  --  but not in the wild unreasoning way Ip160had loved before . I knew I was saying goodbye ( but he said au revoir ) to the best of men . All the same when the day of my departure arrived I felt more like the young girl I had once been than I had for nine long weary years.  |p161It  was dark when I arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was able to take stock of my surroundings . I awoke to the sunshine of an early summer 's morning which filtered into my room through two long narrow slits of window . A feeling of overpowering excitement was with me and for a few moments I lay still saying to myself : " I 'm here . I 'm back . " Then I got out of bed and went to the window . From it I could look down onto the plateau from which the castle rose ; I knew we were high because of the laborious manner in which the horses had climbed the previous evening . I guessed that the castle had been built in the twelfth or thirteenth century like so many I had seen in this part of the world , as a fortress , and had been added to as time progressed . I was sure that the fortress in which I had my room was older than the buildings I was looking down on . These would be known as the Randhausburg , which meant sur/rounding house-castle , and they would contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into the valley to the town of Rochenberg which was the capital city of Duke Carl 's domain . How beautiful it was in the light of early morning , with its mellowed rooftops , its towers and turrets . Smoke was rising from some of the chimneys . Far above it on the hill stood another castle of imposing appearance . Like the Schloss Klocksburg there was the fortress with its turrets rising up stark from the mountainside , proclaiming its impregnability ; I could make out the machicolated friezes which adorned the watch tower , and the round tower with the pointed roof and battlements from which in the past boiling oil and water would have been hurled down on attacking enemies . It was the most impressive of any among all the many castles I had ever seen . A knock on my door made me turn from the window . It was a maid with hot water . Breakfast would arrive in fifteen minutes ' time , she told me . In a state of exultation I washed and dressed . I shook out my long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be when we had taken our breakfast in the hunting lodge . The magic was coming back to me so vividly , that I do n't think I should have been surprised to see him walk in , but when there was a knock on the door it was only the maid with my breakfast tray  --  coffee , rye bread , and lots of fresh unsalted butter . It tasted good and while I was drinking my second cup of coffee there was another knock and Frau Graben came in . She was beaming and looked as though she were very proud of herself . " So you 're really here , " she said . It was gratifying to know that my presence gave her so much pleasure . " Oh , I do hope you are going to be happy , " she went on . " I 've impressed on Dagobert that he must be a good boy because it is a great honor that an English lady should come all this way to teach him . If you have anyp163difficulty with him just tell him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It always does . " " When shall I see them ? " " As soon as you 're ready . Perhaps you 'd like to talk to them a bit about what you 're going to teach them . You wo n't want to start lessons today . When you 've seen them I will take you round the castle . " " Thank you . I shall be most interested to see it . That 's a very big castle I can see from my window . " She smiled . " That 's the Duke 's residence , " she said . " Oh yes , it 's more grand than little Klocksburg which is only right and proper . I came to the royal castle when I was a young girl and looked after the boys . It became like home to me . And then afterwards the Count wanted me here . That was when Dagobert was born and he did n't know what to do with the child . After that Fritzi and Liesel Joined us . But drink up your coffee or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I said it was excellent . " I believe you are quite excited about being here . I can ice it 's done you good already . " I replied that I hoped I should give satisfaction . I had never taught before . " This is n't ordinary teaching , " she said with that comfortablecomplacency which I had found rather charming . " It 's conversation that matters , so that they get the right accent . I'liat 's what the Count will look for . " " I 'm very eager to see them . " " They 'll have had breakfast . I 'll send for them to come to the schoolroom . " We left my room and descended a spiral staircase which led into a hall . " This is where the schoolroom is , " she said . " Are we in the Randhausburg ? " " No . . . we 're still in the fortress . The children have their rooms here just below yours but the rest of the household lives more in the Randhausburg . " She opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said.  | " The pastor comes to teach them . You will have to make your arrangements with him about the English lessons . " " There should be a lesson every day , " I said . " I am sure regularity is necessary . Perhaps an hour a day and very soon I hope to converse in English when I am with them , and perhaps take them for walks and give them easy lessons that way . " That sounds excellent . " We went into the schoolroom  --  quite a large room with several embrasures in which were windows looking down on the town and across to the royal castle . The view from the windows was breathtaking . There was a long table , rather scratched on its surface , and the legs were kicked . I guessed many generations of children had sat at that table . In the embrasures were window seats on which lay books . I remarked that it was a very pleasant room in which to work . Frau Graben glanced at the watch pinned to her blouse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do hope they are not going to be too difficult . " There was a knock on the door and one of the maids entered ; she was holding a little girl by the hand and behind her came two boys . " This is Dagobert and Fritz and here is Liesel , " said Frau Graben . Dagobert clicked his heels and bowed from the waist , Fritz watching him did the same , Liesel dropped a curtsy . " This is Miss Trant who has come to teach you English . " " Good morning , " said Dagobert in guttural English . " Good morning , " I replied . Dagobert looked at his brotherand sister as though expecting applause . I smiled at them . " We shall soon have you all speaking English , " I said in German . " Is it easy ? " asked Fritz . " When you 've mastered it , " I assured them . " Shall I speak it ? " asked Liesel.  | " You will all speak it . " Frau Graben said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get to know them more easily . Perhapsthey could show you the castle . That would be a good way of getting friendly . " I thanked her . She was tactful , and I was sure that I could come to terms with my new pupils more easily on my own . Liesel ran to the door as it shut on Frau Graben . I said : " Come back , Liesel , and make my acquaintance . " Liesel turned and put her tongue out at me . Dagobert said : " She 's only a seamstress ' daughter . She does n't know how to behave . " Liesel began to scream : " I do . My papa is the Count . He Will beat you . My papa loves me . " " Our father would not have you forget your manners , " said Dagobert . " So although you have the misfortune to be the daughter of a common seamstress , you have a noble father and you should not disgrace him . " " You disgrace him , " said Liesel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , Fraulein Trant , " he said , but his eyes as they swept over me were contemptuous and it struck me that I should have more trouble with him than with the wayward Liesel . Fritz  --  Frau Graben 's Fritzi  --  had not spoken . He was regardingme with solemn dark eyes . It occurred to me that he might be the more difficult to understand . I had already decided that Dagobert was a young braggart , Liesel a spoiled child , but I had yet to form an opinion of Fritz . " So you are Fritz , " I said . Ile nodded . " You 're not to nod , " said Dagobert . " Papa said so . You have to speak and say yes or no . " I said : " You are going to learn English . Do you know anyyet ?  --  " I know Good afternoon , Mr. " " Good afternoon , Mrs. , " chanted Liesel.  | Dagobert crowned it with : " Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen ! " and watched me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but will not get you very far . What else do you know ? " " God save the Queen ! " said Dagobert . " We shouted it when the Queen of England came here . We all had flags and had to wave them . " He waved an imaginary flag ; then he started to run round the room shouting " God save the Queen . " I said : " Please be quiet now , Dagobert . The Queen is nothere so it is not necessary . You have shown me how youshouted for her when she was here , so I know . " Dagobert paused . " But I want to shout for the Queen . " " The rest of us might not want to hear . " The children all looked expectant and Dagobert said craftily : " But you 've just come to teach us English , not to tell us when we ca n't shout for the Queen . " The other two looked at Dagobert in admiration . I could imagine the state of affairs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , I could imagine his spreading rebellion . He had too high an opinion of himself . That , I decided , must be deflated as soon as possible . I said : " If I am going to teach you I must have someauthority . It is not a very admirable or clever thing to do torun round a room calling out a catch phrase even though it does show a hospitable sentiment toward the Queen of England . As I wanted to talk to you about your lessons I would prefer you not to continue , Dagobert . " Dagobert was astonished . I knew at once that he was not correctly disciplined and that he needed a firm hand more than the others . I could certainly look for trouble from Dagobert . " My father went to Saxe-Coburg to see the Queen , " Fritz told me shyly . " That was a long time ago , " said Dagobert scornfully . " Prince Albert is dead and the Queen is a widow , God save the Queen . God ... "  | " Not again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to I will . " " In your own company then , " I said . " I am going to ask Fritz and Liesel to show me the Schloss , and I shall tell them about our English lessons . " Dagobert looked at me coldly defiant ; his legs apart , his head flung back , his blue eyes flashing . I turned away and said : " Come , Fritz . . . Liesel ... " Dagobert said : " No . You 're not to . " I felt my future authority depended on the next few seconds so I took Liesel 's hand . She tried to draw it away but I held it firmly . Her big blue eyes surveyed me with a kind of scared wonder . It was Fritz who decided . " I 'll show you , Fraulein , " he said . " Thank you , Fritz . " His eyes were large and expressive . I knew that he had scarcely stopped looking at me since they had come into the room . I smiled at him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room shouting " God Save the Queen " but I shut the door firmly on him and said : " In English we do n't say Fraulein , Fritz . We say Miss . I 'm Miss Trant , you see . " " Miss , " said Fritz . I nodded . " Come on , Liesel . You say it too . " " Miss , " said Liesel , and laughed . " We shall have a short lesson every day , " I told them , " and when we are together we will speak in English . We Nvill surprise your father with your progress . Now you will tell me about the Schloss . It is castle in English . Can you say castle ? " They both said it to my satisfaction and their own intense delight . I contemplated that it would have been easy withoutDagobert . They showed me the rooms in the fortress  --  all with their embrasures in which were the long narrow windows . They took me up to the tower and Fritz told me that the tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because thep168falling missiles which they used to throw down on the invadingforces sounded like the screeching of cats . We stood up there looking down on the town and across the mountains and Fritz pointed out the Duke 's castle high on the slope . Could I see the long buildings on the eastern side ? They were the barracks and there the Duke 's Guards lived . It was fun to see them standing there . " They guard it all the time , " said Fritz . " Do n't they , Liesel ? " Liesel nodded . " They have blue coats . " " Dark blue coats , with gold on their sleeves and they have yell shining helmets . Sometimes they have feathers in them . They stand so still you think they 're not real . " " I should like to see them . " " We 'll show you , wo n't we , Liesel ? " Liesel nodded . I felt I was getting on very well . Liesel was ready to go with whoever was the leader , I could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much smaller but then he was several years younger . His eyes were dark whereas Dagobert 's eyes were light blue ; his hair was brown and straight , Dagobert 's waved about his head like a glisteninggold cap . Dagobert was the handsome one but Fritz interested me . He had a sensitive face and I remembered Fran Graben 's saying that he missed a mother . I could well believe it . Dagobert would be self-sufficient ; Fritz less so . I was sure though that Fritz was going to prove the better pupil . I thought : He would be a year older than my own child . And I thought fleetingly how wonderful it would be if she had lived and all had gone as in those magic three days I had believed they would . Suppose this were my home  --  suppose instead of these children I were here with my own . . . I shook myself free of fancies . I must be firmly realistic-I must not allow the pine forests to put their spell on me . " We 'll go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell youp169what everything is in English . That will be a lovely and easy way to learn . " " Will Dagobert come ? " asked Liesel . " If he wants to . " " Shall he be whipped if he wo n't ? " asked Fritz . " Would you whip him ? " I could not see myself so engaged so I smiled faintly . " I shall just ignore him . If he does n't want to learn he will be ignorant and when the Count comes he will say : Well , what English have you learned ? ' And you and Liesel will speak to him in English and he will be pleased . Dagobert will know nothing . Liesel laughed . " It 'll serve him right , " she commented . They took me down into the Randhausburg . This was of much later period  --  sixteenth or seventeenth century , I beltlieved . It consisted of several turreted buildings on the mountain plateau above which the fortress rose . The sleepingquarters of the rest of the household were in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used for ceremonial occasions . Beyond this was the stoneSnoredkitchen with its roasting spits and cauldrons . It smelled of sauerkraut and onions . During our tour we met one or two of the servants who bobbed curtsies at me when Fitz told them who I was . It was in the Rittersaal that Dagobert appeared ; he stood quietly listening to what I had to say and he was trying to pretend I could see that he had been with us all the time . " This was where the knights used to be , " Fritz told me . Dagobert said : " Look at all the swords on the wall . " " That one 's the Count 's , " said Fritz . " No , that one , " contradicted Liesel . " That 's the biggest . " " They 're all the Count 's , sillies , " declared Dagobert . Liesel put out her tongue . " We 're going to speak English and you 're not going to know any . Fraulein Trant said so . " " No that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I said was that if Dagobert did n't want to be with us when wep170learn he would know nothing and then your father would wonder why he could n't speak English like you and Fritz . " " I 'll speak English best of all , " said Dagobert . I smiled inwardly . This was early victory . " Can he ? " asked Fritz almost anxiously , and I knew then that Fritz was hoping for an opportunity to excel the half brother who beat him at almost everything he did . " The one who works the hardest will be the best , " I said . " It 's as simple as that . " Victory indeed ! I had instilled in my pupils a determination to apply themselves and succeed . After we had examined the Randhausburg we went back to the fortress , and the children showed me the hunting room . The ceiling of this room was decorated with groups of animals and there were some stuffed heads on the walls among guns of various kinds . " We practice shooting , " Dagobert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bang ! Bang ! I shoot to kill . " You could n't , " said Fritz . The cartridges are all blank . " " Yes , I could , " insisted Dagobert . " Bang . " " We have archery lessons too , " Fritz told me . " We practice in the courtyard , " add Dagobert . I hit the target every time . " " You do n't , " Fritz disagreed . " I could if I wanted to . " " Well , I shall see , " I said . " Now we 'll go to the schoolroom and I 'll see the Pastor . " " The Pastor does n't come today , " Dagobert said , scornful of my ignorance . " Then I shall tell you what I hope to do about our daily lesson . Then I can arrange the time with the Pastor when he does come . " We were mounting the staircase and came to a passage . I could turn right or left . One way led to my room , so I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiral staircase . I started up this when Fritz called to me urgently : " Fraulein Trant ... "  |p171I  was about to say : " It 's Miss Trant in English , " when I turned and saw the fearful expression on his face . He was standing at the bottom of the staircase . " What 's wrong , Fritz ? " I asked . " You must n't go up there . " The other children came up . Their faces bore the same excited yet frightened look . " Why not ? " I asked . " The haunted room 's up there , " explained Fritz . " Haunted ? ' Who says so ? " " Everybody , " answered Dagobert . " Nobody goes there . " " The servants go to dust it , " contradicted Fritz . " Never by themselves . If you go there by yourself something terrible will happen to you . You 'd die and stay thereforever to haunt people . " Fritz had turned very pale and I said sharply : " That 's nonsense . What could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Fritz . " Has anyone seen it ? " I asked . There was silence . I walked up a step or two then Fritz said : " Come back , Fraulein , Miss ... " I said : " There 's nothing to be afraid of , I 'm sure . " An irresistible urge forced me to go on and besides I did not want the children , on whom I had made a good impression , to think me afraid , particularly Dagobert who , as I advanced , crept up behind me . All the children were watching me . The staircase ended in a small landing on which was a door . I went toward it and took the doorknob in my hands . I heard the gasp behind me . I turned the handle . The door was locked . The rest of the day passed as though I were in a dream ; I had to keep reminding myself that I was really here . I took luncheon with Frau Graben in a little room in the Randhuusburgwhich she said was her sanctum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little afraid that I might not live entirely up to expectations . I had not had a great deal to do with children ; yet although I had never thought to teach , when I had realized that I might have a child dependent on me and use had suggested that I teach in the Damenstift , the idea had seemed possible . I had thought of Ilse quite often since I had known I was coming here and of how strange it was that after we had been so close during my months of waiting for the birth of my child she should have faded out of my life . For I really had no idea where she was now . In the afternoon of that day I met Pastor Kratz , a shriveledlittle man with very bright sparkling eyes . He thought it an excellent plan , he said , that I had come to teach the children English . He himself had toyed with the idea of introducingit into the series of lessons he gave , but his accent was not good , nor was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a language like a native of the land to which it belonged , and when that teacher had a good command of the pupil 's language also , then it was ideal . I was to give the children half an hour 's lesson each morning and another half hour 's session in the afternoons , but I set greater store on what they would learn through conversation with me . " The Count will expect quick progress , " said the Pastor , his eyes twinkling . " He is a very impatient man . " Fran Graben confirmed this . " He was always like that , even worse than his cousin . " " Who was his cousin ? " I asked . " The Prince , the Duke 's only son and heir . They were brought up together as boys . What a handful ! I can tell you all about that . I was nurse to them both . " The Pastor invited me to call at the church when he would show me the Processional Cross . The church was well worth a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout Europe . I must come and see them . The Cross itself was kept strongly guarded in an oak chest whichp173dated back to the twelfth century . Notice had to be given if one wished to see it , for the keys of the chest were locked away in a secret place and only the current pastor knew ww here ; it was a secret passed on from pastor to pastor , a custom which had gone back all those years , for the Cross , with its lapis lazuli and chalcedony , its rubies , pearls , and diamonds , was priceless . I said I should love to see it . " Then you must let me know when and it shall be brought out for you . Two of the Duke 's guards will be on duty at the church while we look at it . " " So it is as priceless as that ? " " It 's an old custom really . The church has always had to he guarded when the Processional Cross was brought out . Old customs die hard in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we were going to get along well . He was an unworldly little man but his zest for enjoyment was clearly great and both these qualities I found endearing . In the afternoon the children took me for a little walk round the plateau on which the castle had been built . The scenery was magnificent . I was fascinated as always by the tall straight pines and firs and the little streams . We wandereda little downhill from the plateau , and the castle was soon hidden from our view by the trees ; I loved it all  --  the sudden rush of a waterfall  --  the silver and spruce firs  --  the occasional woodcutter 's hut ; the sight of a little village belowus and the sudden tinkle of bells which the cows wore about their necks to guide the cowherds in which direction to go to find them when the mist descended . I talked to the children as we went , giving them the English names for what we saw . They seemed to find this an exciting game and I ) agobert was on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much better than the others . Fritz , however , seemed to learn more easily and I was secretly glad about this . I felt drawn strongly toward the quiet dark boy.  |p174When  we returned Frau Graben was waiting for us rather anxiously . " I was afraid they would have taken you too far , " she said . " Now , children , you just go off and Ida will give you your milk . Miss Trant , you come with me . I have a treat for you . " The treat was tea . " We know what you English are for tea , " she said , beaming , and I felt I could not have been made more welcome . It was very pleasant to sit in Frau Graben 's little room which looked onto a tiny cobbled courtyard . " It 's worked out so very well , " she said . " It 's so strange , " I replied . " If I had n't happened to be in the shop that day ... " " Do n't let 's think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are here and that makes me happy . What do you think of the children ? " " They are interesting . " " They 've all had such unconventional beginnings . Dagobertis the son of the Count and a lady of high quality . He would have married her but Count Ludwig , his father , would n't give his permission . It was not the match he wanted for Frederic , and Frederic is near enough to the dukedom to have to obey orders . So he made the right marriageand now he has a fine boy of eight . He sets great store by him and I know he hoped he 'd inherit the dukedom one day , because the Prince was so reluctant to marry . " " So this boy is the heir . " " Not he . And that 's a sore point with Master Count . The Duke insisted the Prince , his son , marry and he could n't hold out forever . It was a necessary marriage ; one of the terms in a treaty Rochenstein made with Klarerbock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . There 's a child  --  a boy ; he 's three years old , a son and heir . So our Prince has done his duty . " " I suppose I shall learn the country 's politics in due course . "  | " They 're frequently discussed . In a little country like this the reigning family lives close to the people . " " Shall I see the Prince and Princess ? " I er expression was suddenly enigmatical ; she seemed to be suppressing secret mirth . " Oh , our ruling family 's seen , " she said . " Not like England royalty , you know . We hear about England . It 's because of our close ties since the Queen 's marriage with one of our Princes . I hear she shuts herself away since she lost him . She goes around in her widow 's weeds and wo n't give up mourning , though it must be . . . how long since he died ? " " It 's nine years , " I said . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Duke is n't allowed to shut himself away . He comes down from the castle into the town to attend certain functions ; he hunts in the forests . The Prince is away at the moment . He 's in Berlin at the Court of Prussia representing his father at a conference . Count Bismarck is constantly summoning heads of state to Berlin . I think he 's of the opinion that we 're all vassals of great Prussia . He is apt to forget that we are independent states and that is what the Prince is no doubt telling him now . " " You know the Prince well , I suppose . " " I should do . I was his nurse . He and the children 's father were brought up together . And what a task to keep those two in order . The spirits ! They were always fighting , those two boys . What a pair . The Prince is sure of himself , playing the Grand Duke almost in the nursery and Count Frederic determined to show he was as good as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I 'll have none of their oh ! tantrums  --  I 've told them both . I still think of them as my IKovs in the nursery and however grand they may think they ale to others they 're just my two boys to me . " I asked if the children were like their father . " There 's a resemblance , " she said . " Dagobert 's got a look of him . That affair was more serious than the others . Lieselp176was the daughter of the sewing woman whom the Count took a fancy to . " " And Fritz ? " I asked . " Fritz was two and a half when he came here . His mother had died , they said . She 'd been a lady of quality and when Fritz was conceived she had disappeared . The Count was frantic for a while , but you know how these men are . He was quickly on with the next . Then the woman who had been Fritz 's foster mother died . I knew her ; she was once one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to be brought up with Dagobert . But Fritzi was old enough to remember that he was n't always here ; I think it upsets him a bit . The woman who cared for him was like a mother to him and he missed her . " " This Count seems to be very careless as to where he fathers children . " " My dear Miss Trant , he 's only following the tradition . They 've always been for the women . They see them , they fancy them and there 's no holding them back . If there are results they do n't mind and nor do the women . Take Liesel . She 's well looked after , she 's being educated , a good marriagewill be made for her . That would n't have happened to her if her mother had married a woodcutter , say . The child would be wandering the forest gathering sticks and not beingsure where her next meal was coming from . " I was silent for a while ; then I said , " I think I shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them as much as possible . I 'm already looking forward to the time when we converse in English . " " It 'll come . You 're going to succeed . I 'm sure the Count will be pleased . " " If he is n't , " I said , " I shall go back to England . " Then I thought of it : the shop , working for the parish , gradually clinging to the comfort which Anthony was offering . But at the moment I was in revolt against all that , for something told me that I was on the verge of discovery , that life was going to be exciting , though perhaps not happy  --  for happiness and excitement did not always go together . Not yet , Anthony , I thought , and then I realized that although I had relegated him to the back of my mind I liked to think of him there . " Do n't say that , when you 've only just come . What do you think of Klocksburg ? " " It 's fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have spent here but I never thought to live in one . " " The children showed you over it , I hope ? " " Yes , they took me everywhere , I think . . . except one part . It appeared to be locked . " " Oh the haunted room . There are haunted rooms in most castles , you know . " " What is the story about this one ? " She hesitated . " Oh , the usual , love . . . ending in tragedy . A young woman threw herself from the window to herdeath . " " Why ? " " It was years ago . The present Duke 's great-grandfather , I think , brought her here . She thought she was his wife . " " And she was n't ? " " It was a mock marriage . It was often done  --  still is . The girl would not give in to him so the marriage was arranged . The so-called priest who performed the ceremony was no priest at all but one of the courtiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl was tricked . Her scruples were calmed and the honeymoon followed . In these cases when the bridegroom grows tired of the liaison he passes on and the lady realizes the truth . It 's been done many a time . " " I see . And this girl ? " " Her lover was deeply enamored of her . The story is that he might have married her if he had not been married already  --  as his position demanded . " " So he deceived her ? " " Deceiving simple girls was one of their favorite pastimes.  |p178It  meant more to them than ruling their lands . But he was more involved than was customary with this girl . He brought her to Klocksburg and she lived here thinking herself a countess . At first he came often to visit her and then the visits grew less frequent . From the turret room  --  the one behind the locked door  --  so the story used to look ' ' goes  --  shefor him . From the window you can see the road winding right down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then one day he came , but with him he brought his Countess who had insisted on accompanying him . The poor girl wondered who the lady was and when , the Count entered Klocksburg the first thing he did was go up to that room to his mistress . The story is that when he told her the truth she would n't believe it . He insisted she keep quiet about their relationship . She must come down to the Randhausburg and behave as though she was here as the chatelaine of the castle to keep it in order for the time when the Count and his Countess should call . When he went away she locked herself in her room and , opening the casement window wide , jumped out to her death . Well , you can see how these stories start from that . " " Poor girl , " I said . " She was foolish , " said Frau Graben , pursing her lips . " She could have lived all her days in comfort . The Princes always looked after their favored women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing oneself married and finding one was not . " " They say she haunts the place . Some say they 've seen her . If she comes back it must be because she realizes that it was a silly thing she did . She could have gone on living in comfort . " I understand her feelings . " " Well , I keep the door locked . I do n't want any of themaids getting hysterics . I go in with one of them once a week to dust and clean ; then I see that it 's locked up . " I could n't get out of my mind the thought of that girl 's watching for her lover and learning how he had deceivedp179her . When she had told the story Frau Graben had seemed secretly amused , sly even . I felt for the first time that she might not be the simple warmhearted woman I had imaginedher to be . It seemed absurd to say there was something sinister about her  --  but that was how it seemed . I quickly dismissed the thought as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly how she felt . My dreams , as dreams so often are , were muddled , and I was the girl ; and the man I saw riding up the mountain was Maximilian . The children were very excited because Pastor Kratz was going to show me the Processional Cross . The road down to the town was about a mile long though there was a path which could only be undertaken on foot or on horseback , which was much shorter . There was a sure-footed little mare in the stables which had been put at my disposal , and the children had their ponies . Frau Graben said that Liesel should not ride all the way down to the town as she was not a practiced enough rider , and as the little girl set up wails of protest at the thought of being excluded from the expedition , she promised to take her down in the horse carriage while I went down on my mare with the boys . It was a beautiful afternoon ; the sun was shining through the trees and one caught glimpses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he liked to see himself as a leader , but Fritz kept by my side as though he were taking care of me . He was ahead of Dagobert in his English and displayed a remarkable ability for remembertugthe words I taught . Already he had a small vocabulary Bich was very pleasing . As the trees grew less thick we could see the distant mountains and my eyes as ever went to the royal castle and I thought of Frau Graben as a young woman in her nursery there with the two boys on whom even now she clearly doted . Below was the town taking on a definite character as wep180approached . . . a fairy-tale town with turrets , towers , and red-tiled roofs against a background of trees . Although the main part of the town was in the valley it was to some extent built on the slope and as we passed first through the oberer Stadtplatz , with its fountain and arcades of shops , I was reminded vividly of Lokenburg , on the Night of the Seventh Moon . We were now in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth anniversary of that night . I must ask Frau Graben whether the occasion was celebrated here . We passed through narrow streets which sloped down to the enterer Stadtplatz and here was the church with its baroque dome and Gothic walls . Dagobert told me that we should stable the horses in the Prince Carl Inn which was close by the church . Delightedly knowledgeable , he led the way . The innkeeper received us with some deference for he knew the boys . Dagobert haughtily accepted this and our horses were taken and we went to the church on foot where Frau Graben and Liesel were already waiting . Pastor Kratz said how pleased he was that he could show me the Cross . Two soldiers from the palace were already standing on guard in the crypt where the oak chest was kept . " I 'm afraid it 's a great deal of trouble , " I said . " No , no , " cried the Pastor . " We like people to see the Cross . Usually there is a small party of sightseers but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to wait for that . I should be delighted to show you the church , first . " This he did . It was a fine old church dating back to the twelfth century ; the stained-glass windows were the pride of the town , the Pastor told me gleefully , and they were magnificent ; the blues , reds , and golds depicted the story of the Crucifixion and lit by the sun presented a truly magnificentsight . There were memorial tablets on the walls and Ip181read the inscriptions ; these were scions of the old families of the district . " The ducal family does not appear to be represented here , " I said . " They have their own chapel in the castle , " said Frau Graben . " They come here , though , for State occasions , " put in the Pastor . " Coronations , royal christenings , and such events . " " Those would be great occasions for the people , " I added . " Yes , indeed . Like everyone else we enjoy our ceremonies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " explained Frau Graben , " are not buried here . They have a special burial ground . It 's an island . " " I want to take Fraulein Trant to the Island of Graves , " announced Dagobert . " I do n't like it much , " said Fritz . " You 're afraid , " accused Dagobert . " Now , now , " put in Frau Graben . " Nobody 's going to take anybody to the Island of Graves that does n't want togo . " " What a strange name , " I said . " You children run on , " said Frau Graben . " Go out and look at the tombstones . " " It 's not the same as the Island , " said Dagobert . " It could n't be because it 's not an island . " The boys had stopped to study an effigy in stone . Dagobertspelled out the inscription . Frau Graben drew me aside and I asked : " What is this Island of Graves ? " " You should visit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want Liesel to go . She 's too young . It 's rather a morbidspot . But it 's only the Family 's burial ground . The island is in the middle of a lake and there is a ferryman who lives there and rows people back and forth . He looks after the graves . " And the members of the ducal family are buried there ? " " The Family and those connected with it . "  | " Servants , you mean ? " " No . . . no . People closer than that . " " Closer ? " " Well , the Dukes , the Counts , they had their friends and sometimes there were children . There is a part of the island which is for people like that  --  close to the Family you might say and yet not of it . " The blue light from the stained-glass window fell across her face as she spoke and again I was struck by the slightly mischievous light in her usually calm and simple face . She went on : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you myself . " " I 'd like to see it , " I said . " We 'll arrange it . " We were ready to go down to the crypt and I was surprised by the little ceremony . It was dank in the crypt ; Fritz kept close to me and I wondered whether it was for my protection or his own ; Dagobert 's swagger was a little less convincing . There certainly was an eeriness about the place , perhaps because of the smell of damp and the dimness of the light . Our footstepsrang out on the stone floor seeming to echo and then I saw the great oak chest on either side of which stood a soldier in the blue and gold uniform of the Duke 's Guards . They stood at attention while three soldiers approached . One of these held the key . I was astonished and a little embarrassed that all this ceremony should be for me . The Pastor took the heavy bunch of keys . Opening the chest took a little time but the operation at length was completed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the silver goblets , the chalice and the crosses which were of silver and gold set with semiprecious stones . But the latter were not to be compared with the Processional Cross which was kept separately in its heavy wooden case which again had to be unlocked . It was at length revealed to me . The children gasped as they gazed on it  --  lying on blackp183velvet . It seemed to shine with an uncanny light and was intricately wrought in gold , enamel , and precious gems . Each of the large stones which formed the center had , I was told , a story attached to it . Each had been won in battle . In those days the country had been wild and the small dukedomsand principalities were constantly at war with each other . The center diamond and the two rubies on either side had been set in the Cross to emphasize the invincibility of the Dukes of Rochenstein . If the Cross were stolen it was believed that would be the end of the line . This was why it was so guarded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legendary importance . I was rather glad when the cross was back in its box and the chest locked ; so were the soldiers . They relaxed at once and ceased to look like stone statues . The children changed too ; they began to talk in loud voices whereas previously they had whispered . They appeared to know the soldiers well . One called Sergeant Franck was a particularly jolly fellow . We came up from the crypt and were soon in the sunshine . " There , " said Frau Graben , " now you 've seen the ProcessionalCross . You 'll see all the sights in time . " She seemed to be secretly amused and again I wondered whether I really knew her as well as I had thought.  |p184It  was the boys who took me first to the Island of Graves . Each afternoon during my first week at Klocksburg we went out into the forest  --  they on their ponies , I on my mare . I enjoyed these jaunts for they enabled me to get to know the children better and I was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out I felt as though I were on the verge of an adventure . As we were in summer the mountainsidesseemed to be touched by a blue and pink mist which were the gentians and orchids flourishing there at that time of the year . They were breathtakingly lovely among the green . On this particular day the boys had led me onto the downward slopes and as the land grew flat we came to a little wood in which the trees grew so close that the branches caught at us as we rode beneath them . We came to a clearingand there to my astonishment was a lake , in the middlep185of which was an island . On the shore were two boats fitted with oars . They had made up their minds to bring me here , I guessed , and were about to show me something of which they were rather proud . We tethered our horses to one of the trees and both boys set about gathering the leaves and flowers which grew close to the water . Then Dagobert cupped his hands about his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked whom they were calling and they both exchanged secret glances . Dagobert said : " Wait and see , miss . " I replied that I wanted to know what they were about and appealed to Fritz . He pointed toward the island in the middle of the lake and I saw a boat being pushed out . A man jumped into it and began rowing toward us . " That 's Franz , " Fritz told me . Dagobert was determined to be the one who disclosed the secret . " Franz , " he said , " is the keeper of the Grilber Insel . He is coming to take us over so that we can put flowers on our mothers ' graves . You can row over yourself but Franz likes you to call him . " The distance between the Island of Graves and the shore was , I guessed , less than a quarter of a mile . The man in the boat was very old and bent ; his gray hair grew long about his face which was almost covered by his beard so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were imbedded in wrinkles . " Franz , " called Dagobert , " we want to show Miss Trant the Island . " Old Franz brought the boat on the shore . " Well , young masters , " he said , " I was expecting you . " 11 is voice had a hollow ring ; he wore a long black robe like a monk 's and on his head was a tiny black skullcap . The little eyes were on me now.  | " I heard you were here , Fraulein , " he said . " You must come over to my Island . " " She wants to see the graves , " said Dagobert . I was unaware that I had expressed such a wish but it seemed impolite to say so before their keeper . " It was time you young masters came , " said Franz . He took my hand to help me into the boat . His was dry , rough , and cold . Something about him made me shiver . I thought of him as Charon , the boatman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect me , I thought , and I was touched . Dagobert leaped into the boat . " Are you frightened , miss ? " he asked gleefully , clearly hoping that I was . " Why do you ask ? Did you expect me to be ? " " Franz lives all alone on Graber Insel , do n't you , Franz ? Most people are a bit scared when they go there because there 's nobody there but the dead and Franz , of course . I wonder if you will be scared . Franz is n't scared . He lives there all alone with the dead , do n't you , Franz . " " For seventy years , " he said . " Seventy years on the island . My father was keeper before me , and I knew I 'd follow on . " He shook his head sadly . " I 've no son to follow me . " " What will they do when you die , Franz ? " asked Dagobert . Old Franz shook his head . " They 'll bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father to son . " " Oh , Franz , the dead wo n't like it . I bet they 'll hauntthe next one and drive him away . " " This is a very morbid subject , " I said . " I 'm sure Franz will be the keeper for many years yet . " Franz looked at me with approval . " My grandfather lived to ninety . My father to ninety-three . They say that the dead give the gift of long life to their keepers . " " Oh , but you have n't got a son to follow you , Franz , " Dagobert reminded him . " They wo n't like that . " " Why are you so pleased at the prospect , Dagobert ? " I asked  | " Well , they 'll come out and haunt the next one , that 's why . " The oars lapped gently in the water . I could see the island very clearly now . There appeared to be avenues of trees and flowering shrubs . It was very beautiful ; and among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gingerIncad cottage in Hansel and Gretel . I felt as though I were entering that fairy-tale world again . The boat came to rest on the shore and we scrambled out . " First show her the ducal graves , " demanded Dagobert . " Come this way , " said Franz . The two boys went off to lay their flowers on their mothers ' graves and I followed Franz into one of the avenues between the flowers and the trees . There were the graves . They were magnificently kept and glowing with flowers ; the marble effigies were beautiful ; so were the statues of angels guarding the graves and on some were gilded caskets and ornamentations in gilt and wrought iron . " These are the graves of the Family , " Franz told me . " After the memorial services and the burial ceremonies they are brought over to me to lie in their final resting place . I tend the shrubs and keep the graves fresh . Members of the Family sometimes come here , but rarely young ones . The young do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because their mothers lie here . . . though not among the ducal avenues . There are two burial grounds here  --  that of the Dukes and their legitimate families and those whom they have honored , as they call it . Some might say dishonored . The boys come because they like to remind themselvesthat they are connected with the Family . I will show you the other graves afterwards . First look at these of the Family . This one is Ludwig 's grave . He is the brother of Duke Carl and a traitor . He was killed by the Duke 's friends and just in time for if he had not been killed he would have killed the Duke . " " I have heard something of Ludwig . "  | " He will not easily be forgotten . And there is Count Frederic to follow him . Trouble ... trouble ... " " Why should there be trouble between the Duke and Count Frederic ? " " There is often trouble in families , particularly our old German ones . In the old days when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see who should have what there was . An estate divided would have brought very little to brothers  --  if there were many of them  --  and there so often were  --  so that the only thing was to draw lots and let the winner take all . This has caused trouble through the ages . Those who have not inherited believe they owe their positions at the present day to the ill luck of their ancestors in the past . Many seek to win back by treachery what luck has denied them . Ludwig was such a one . He wanted to unseat Carl and rule Rochenstein himself . " " And the boys ' father is his son ? " " Yes , Count Frederic will have to be careful . He will have the Prince to answer to . But Frederic is clever . He 'll bide his time . " " So these are the dead ones , " I said . " Well , if they suffered when they were alive they have been given due homage here . The graves are lovely . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franz said , his face lighting with a smile . " I 'll swear there are no more beautiful graves than mine in the whole of Europe . " I walked down the line of graves and read the inscriptions . There were the Dukes of Rochenstein and Dorrenig and Counts Lokenburg . " Family titles all of them , " murmured Franz . As ever when I read that name I thought of myself back in the hunting lodge and the ceremony when Maximilianhad slipped a ring on my finger . . . a ring which disappeared with my dreams . . . and the marriage lines which said I was his wife which had no substance either . There were several avenues , all exquisitely kept  --  the grass weeded , the flowers blooming to perfection . I saw the boys who called to me , and old Franz led mep189over to them . I passed through a gate and was in a walled graveyard . Here the graves were simple mounds with small gray stones at the head of them . I noticed some had no stones at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are buried here with the permission of some member of the Family , " Franz explained . " I 'll show you my mother 's grave , " said Dagobert . I followed him , stepping cautiously between the graves to one with a headstone rather more elaborate than most of the others . On it was written Countess von Plinschen and the date of her death , 1858 . Dagobert said : " She died when I was born . . . she died having me . " " That 's sad , " I murmured , touched to see the reverent manner in which he laid the pink orchids on her grave . Fritz said : " My mother died too . Can I show you where she is ? " He took my hand and we walked away from the others . I was conscious of the eyes of Franz following me and I thought what a gruesome place this was , and it was a pity that the Family , as they were called , had n't buried their dead in a churchyard like normal people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneeling by that grave . It simply said on it Luisa Freundsberg and nothing more . " She loved me very much , " said Fritz , " but of course I was an embarrassment to her . " " My dear Fritz , " I said . " You must have been a great joy to her . " His eyes were suddenly touched by pain as he said : " I do n't remember her . I only remember Frau Lichen and then there was Frau Graben . " " Well , I daresay they loved you dearly . " " Yes , " he admitted shyly , " but it is not the same as a mother . " " There will be others in your life to love you , " I assured him ; and that seemed to please him.  |p190We  went back and joined the others . Franz offered us refreshments and we went into his gingerbread-likehouse to partake of them . We stepped down into a room in which were several flowers in pots . The scent was almost overpowering . We sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what tasted like beer . I did n't greatly care for it but the boys drank it with relish . Franz told me he had made it himself . He looked after himself . He never went to the mainland ; his provisions were sent over once a week by the Family , and sometimes he saw no one for weeks on end . The boys visited the island regularly once a month and every now and then when there was a burial the body was brought over by night and laid in its grave . He was gardener and stonemason . In the old days it had been easier . He had helped his father ; his mother had died when he was quite a boy . Women did n't take kindly to Grdber Insel . He himself had married a wife . He had gone to the mainland to find her , he said sadly . He brought her back and waited for his son . But there was no son . The island gave her the creeps , she said . She could n't live there ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rowed herself over to the mainland , and in the morning he awoke to find her gone . She was never heard of since , and he was unable to take another wife  --  even if he could have found one to share his lonely life on the Island of Graves . I was glad when we were in the boat again . There was something uncanny about Grdber Insel and I could n't stop thinking of the old man as Charon the ferryman of the dead . That night I awoke with a start . I dreamed a great deal in the last eight years but never more vividly than since I had come to Klocksburg  --  except of course in the months directly following my adventures . This time I had believed I was on the Island of Graves and in that avenue I found an inscription on which was written Maximilian Count Lokenburg , and as I watchedp191the marble slab was lifted and Maximilian stepped out of the tomb . He came to me and took me in his arms and his embrace was a frozen one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and woke up . I had thrown off all the bedclothes . I was shivering . The window was wide open to the mountain air . I lighted my candle . I knew I should n't sleep for some time . It was all coming back so vividly to me as it always did after dreams and with it that aching sadness with which I had become familiar . It brought with it a fearful sense of loss from which I believed I should nev  --  recover . There could never be anyone in my life to take his place . Then I heard footsteps on the landing outside my room . I looked at my watch . It was just after one o'clock . Who could be walking about at this time ? There were only the children and two maids in the fortress , the rest of the household had their quarters in the Randhausburg . The steps were stealthy as though someone was carefully picking a way toward my room . They stopped . I saw my door handle slowly turn . I remembered that I had locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a habit of this and even at home I did it . " Who is that ? " I asked . There was no answer . I listened , then I heard the footsteps going on . They were mounting the stairs , I believed . I felt the goose pimples rising on my skin ; if I was right and those footsteps were mounting the stairs they could only be going to one place  --  the room in the turret  --  the haunted room . The two maids in the fortress and the children were all afraid of the haunted room . So . . . who could it be who was now stealthily making for it ? My curiosity was greater than my fear . Since I had come here the conviction had grown up within me that I was going to make some great discovery . I could not help feeling that I was a stranger to myself and I must be so to a certain extent because I did not know whether I had actually lived through the greatest adventure of my life or dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what really happened on the Night of the Seventh Moon , I could never understand myself and therefore never know real peace of mind . Why investigating uncanny footsteps on the stairs should help me , I did not know . All I was aware of was that these pine forests were the scene of my lost six days and somewherehere I would find the secret . So I must leave nothing unexplored however remote it might seem to my personal affairs . I hastily wrapped a dressing gown about myself and picked up a candle . I unlocked the door ; I looked out along the landing to the winding staircase . I could distinctly hear the footsteps on the stairs above . I sped up there , holding my candle as firmly as my trembling hand would allow . Someone was there . Could it be the ghost of the woman whose lover had deceived her and who had thrown herself down from the turret win-dows ? The candlelight flickered on the spiral stone stairs which were worn in the middle by hundreds of years of use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . My heart leaped with fear , the candle tipped sideways and almost went out . A figure was standing at the door of the haunted room . I saw a hand reach out to turn the knob . Then I realized who it was . " Fritzi ! " I whispered , using the pet diminutive . He did not look round . I went up to him , all fear evaporated . " Mutter , " he whispered . He had turned to me and seemed to stare without seeing . Then I realized . Fritz was walking in his sleep . I took his hand firmly in mine . I led him down the stairs and back to his room . I put him into his bed , tucked him up , and kissed him lightly on the forehead . I whispered : " Everything is all right , Fritzi . I 'm here to look after you . "  |p193He  whispered : " Mutter ? Mutter meine . . . " 1 sat by his bed . He was very quiet and after a while appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . I was very cold so I got into bed and tried to warm myself . I slept little for the rest of that night ; I kept straining my ears for the sound of footsteps . In the morning I decided to talk to Fran Graben . " He was always a nervous child , " she said , beaming at me . In her sitting room she kept a fire going most of the time and invariably had a kettle singing on it . She also kept what she called a stockpot and this provided a most appetizingsmelling soup . She made tea for me . She always did this with a kind of smug delight as though to say " See how I look after you ? " As we sat sipping the brew I was telling her about last night . " It 's not the first time he 's walked in his sleep , " she said . " It 's dangerous , I should think . " " They say that people who walk in their sleep rarely hurt themselves . There was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . who got out of one of the windows and walked along the parapet of the tower without coming to ally harm . " I shivered . " No , Fritzi 's never come to any harm sleepwalking . They say they step over anything that 's in their way . " " But he must be in a disturbed state to sleepwalk , do n't you think ? " " Poor Fritzi , he 's the sensitive one . He feels things more than the other two . " " Yesterday they took me to the Island of Graves . " " Oh , that upset him . It always does . I do n't like them going there , but do n't like to stop it . After all it 's right they should respect their dead mothers . " " I think it 's a pity there has to be so much talk about the haunted room . The fact that it 's kept locked makes them imagine all sorts of horrors behind those closed doors . Have the children ever been in the room ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're overawed . The fact that Fritz made his way up there shows that it 's on his mind and he connects it in some way with his dead mother , because he was at the Island of Graves yesterday . " " He seems to have been better since you came . Learning English agrees with him . Or perhaps it 's you . He seems to have taken a real fancy to you  --  and you to him . " She gave me that rather sly look of hers . " I reckon he 's your favorite among the children . I 'm glad , for Fritzi 's sake . " " I 'm interested in him . He 's a clever boy . " " I 'll agree with you . " " I think he needs to be a member of a big uncomplicated family . " " They say all children do . " " I was wondering about that room : What is it like ? " " It 's just a room . It 's in the turret and so it 's circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open out . That was why it was so easy for her to open one and get out . " " And this room has been locked for years and years . " " I do n't think so . The fortress was n't used much before Count Frederic brought the children here . Then there was this story about the haunting and I thought it better to keep the door locked . " I hardly liked to go against her authority so I was silent but she pressed me . " You think it 's wrong to keep it locked , then ? " she went on . " If it was treated just like an ordinary room people would forget the story , " I said . " Such stories are best forgotten surely . " She shrugged her shoulders . Then she said : " Would you like me to leave it unlocked ? " " I have an idea it would be better . Then I 'll try to makep195light of it and perhaps go up there occasionally with the children . " " Come with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her keys dangling from her belt like a good chatelaine ; she delighted in those keys . I suppose she regardedthem as a sign of her authority . I put down my cup and we went up to the turret room together ; she unlocked the door . I must confess I caught my breath as we entered , though why I could not imagine . There was nothing eerie about the room ; the windows and its extremely elevated position made it very light . There were several beautiful rugs on the wooden floor , a table , a few chairs , a settee , and a bureau . It looked as though it had been recently occupied . " It 's not been used since . . . " said Frau Graben . " It 's a beautiful room , " I said . " You can use it if you like . " I did not know that I wanted to do that . Approached only by the narrow spiral staircase which led to the turret it was isolated and although it was easy to feel comfortable here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling I had experienced last night when I had followed Fritz up here . " Perhaps we can use it . . . later , " I said . I imagined lessons up here ; laborious conversations in English as to the beauty of the view which was , as from all the windows in the fortress , magnificent . " Which was the window from which the lady fell ? " I asked . She led me across the room . " This one . " She unlatched it and pushed it outwards . I leaned out . I was looking straight down the mountainside , for like so many of the castles in these parts the mountain 's side had been used to form a wall . The drop was sheer . I could see right down to the valley . Frau Graben moved close to me.  | " Silly girl she was ! " she whispered . " She would have been dead before she reached the valley , " I said . " Silly girl ! " she repeated . " She could have had so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been very unhappy . " " No reason to be . This castle was her home . All she had to do was keep in her place and she could have gone on here . . . the mistress of Klocksburg . " " Except when the owner called with his wife . " " She should have had more sense . He was fond of her or he would n't have brought her here . He would have protectedher . But she had to go and jump down there .. . to her end . " I said : " Is she in the Island of Graves ? " " She 'd be there . There is one grave . It just says one name on the tombstone : Girda . ' They say that 's the one . What a silly girl ! It need never have been . It 's a lesson to girls though . " " To make sure they can trust their lovers . " She smiled her fat comfortable smile and gave me a little nudge in the ribs . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . If a count loves you enough to set you up in a castle should n't that satisfy you ? " I said : " It did n't satisfy her . " " Some have had more sense , " she said . I turned away from the window . I wanted to stop thinkingof that girl who had discovered her lover to have tricked her . I understood too well how she must have felt . Fran Graben understood my feelings . " Silly girl , " she insisted once more . " Do n't go on feeling too sorry for her . You 'd have had more sense in her place , I know . " Again that sly smile . " It is a pleasant room . So you 'd like it left unlocked and you 'll come up here now and then . I think you 're right . Yes , it 's a good notion . " The room fascinated me . I was soon feeling an urge to go there alone . I must admit that on the first occasion I went ,  |p197I  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there I experienced a certain excitement . It was a delightful room , perhaps the most attractive in the fortress . Even the view seemed more magnificent seen from these windows . I opened the one from which Girda was alleged to have thrown herself . It opened with a little squeaking protest . It needs oiling , I thought , forcing myself to be practical . How grand the ducal castle looked , a mighty impregnable fortress guarding the town . After frequent conversations with the boys who had on very special occasions been allowed to visit the castle , I could make out the features which they had described . I could see the walls with their flanking turretsand the gate tower fortress . There it stood dating back in some parts to the eleventh century , guarding the town , ready to defend itself from marauders . What an uneasy life people must have led in those days when their greatest concern was to defend themselves . The boys had described the grandeur of the Rittersaal and the tapestries which adorned the walls ; there were gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like those of Versailles , for it had been the desire of every German princeling to follow the example of the great Sun King , and in his little domain to see himself as the mighty French monarch . I reminded the boys what had become of the monarchy of France . Dagobert replied : " Oh yes , old Kratz told us all about that . " Looking out across the sweep of the valley to the town and then up again to the royal castle , I could make out the outhouses of the Randhausburg where I presumed many of the outdoor servants lived ; and there were the barracks too . Across the valley would come the trumpet call to wake them in the morning ; I often heard it soon after dawn , and sometimes when the wind was in the right direction I would hear the band playing in the ducal gardens . But as I sat in the room I wondered about the girl who had been so unhappy that she had decided to end her life.  | I imagined her beautiful , with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book my mother had brought with her from her home . I thought of her sitting at this window awaiting the arrival of her lover and then seeing that other woman  --  the wife , when she herself had believed herself to be married to him . The despair , the wretchedness , the horror would have been overwhelming . I imagined her to have been strictly brought up . She would have believed herself to be dishonoredand see the only way out of her wretchedness was to end her life . Sad Girda ! Perhaps when anyone was as unhappy as she must have been he or she left behind them some aura of the past . Was that what people meant by haunting ? What nonsense ! It could well have been only a legend . Perhaps the girl fell from the window by accident . People like to put dramatic constructions on perfectly ordinary events . I decided that I would exorcise the ghost by making this a normal room so that in a short time no one would consider it any different  --  except perhaps more beautiful  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I brought the children up and gave them a lesson there . At first they were overawed but when they saw that it was just like an ordinary room Dagobert and Liesel forgot about the ghost . Fritz , I noticed , kept looking over his shoulder and did n't like to move too far from my side . He was the sensitive one . I took them to the windows and pointed out the various landmarks giving them their English names . This was always a good way of getting them to learn and I really was becomingquite pleased with their progress . Fritz was by far the best , which pleased me because I thought it would give him the confidence he needed . Liesel was quite a fair mimic and although she could n't always remember words her pronunication was good . Dagobert lagged a little butp199there again I decided that would do him no harm ; he wally was a little braggart . When I was alone with Fritz and we were in the schoolroomI said to him : " Fritz , there 's nothing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frown appeared between his eyes . He said : " A lady jumped out of the window . " " That 's just a story . " " You mean it never happened ? " " It might have done but we ca n't be sure . " He shook his head . " A lady did jump , " he said . He looked at me as though wondering whether he could trust me . " Yes , Fritz , " I said tenderly . " I think it was my mother . " " No Fritz . If it did happen it happened long ago . It could n't possibly have been your mother . " " She died , " he said . " Unfortunately some people do die young . . . but never mind , you have Frau Graben ; you have your father and now you have me . " I felt very moved because he gripped my hand rather tightly and nodded . I was touched to think that already I meant something to him . " There 's nothing to be afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , you know . It may well not be true and if it is , it happened years and years ago . " I had an idea that although he was comforted by my presence he did n't really believe that.  |p200Dagobert  's eyes gleamed with excitement . " There 's going to be a stag hunt , " he told me . " We 're to go . It 's exciting . Bang . Bang . " " You 're to go to hunt stag ? " " This is a special one . My father will be there . " I turned to Fritz . " Are you going ? " Fritz did n't answer and Dagobert shouted : " Of course he 's going . Liesel is n't . She 's too little . " Liesel set up a wail . " She can go in my place , " said Fritz . " She ca n't , " cried Dagobert . " Because you 're frightened that does n't make her old enough . " " I 'm not frightened , " said Fritz . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are , you are , you are , you are ! " Dagobert was danc/in g round Fritz like some irritating dervish . Fritz hit out at him . " Please , stop , " I said . " It is most impolite to fight in front of your English teacher . " Dagobert paused and said : " Would it be impolite to fight behind your back , miss ? " " You are being a little impertinent , Dagobert , " I said , " which is equally impolite . Now stop being foolish . ' Where is this stag hunt to be held ? " " In the forest where the stags are . " " In the Klocksburg forest ? " " No , in the ducal forest . " " Do you mean to say that you boys are going to join the hunt ? " Dagobert tittered , and Fritz said : " It 's a different sort of hunt , miss . They are all together lots of them and they come in and they 're shot dead and . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dagobert . I could see that I could not get from them what I wanted to hear so I went along to Fran Graben . She was seated in an armchair holding a basin in her hand ; she smiled at me when I entered . On the table beside her was a piece of spiced cake such as I had discovered she loved and which she kept in a tin in the cupboard in this room with various other food to take out at odd moments . She rarely sat down to a meal I had discovered but was nibbling titbits throughout the day . She set down the basin as I entered and I could n't help seeing what was in it . Not the soup I had expected but two spiders . She saw my astonishment and gave her fat corn-1m-table laugh . " I like to put them in together and see what they do , " she said . " They 're scouting round at the moment . Do n't know what to make of it . There they are in this strangehite world . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill the other . " " But why . . . " I said.  | " I like to see what they 'll do . You put them together , you see how they take it . Spiders are interesting . The way they weave their webs . . . beautiful things webs . One day I saw a fight between a great bumblebee and a big spider . " Her eyes gleamed with excitement . " The bee was caught in the web and you should have seen that spider get to work ; he wrapped up the bee in his sticky thread but the bee was too strong and the web would n't hold him . He tore himself away and flew off clutching the spider . I often wonder what happened to them . It 's like people . You put them down somewhere with someone else and you see what happens . But I 'm being a silly old woman . I 'm afraid I 'm often that . Now you 're a nice kind young lady and you 're going to say I 'm not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? And you are a bit surprised at my spiders , are n't you ? Never mind . " She smiled comfortably . " You see , dear Miss Trant , I 'm so interested in everybody  --  yes everybody  --  even the spiders . " I said : " The boys say they are going stag hunting , is that true ? " " It 's a form of hunt . You 'll see , because you 're to go with them . " " I go to a hunt ... " " It 's not chasing the stag . You 'll see what it is . The Count wants the boys to go . It 's tomorrow . It 's the shooting festival . It 's a pity the Prince wo n't be home for it . He always enjoyed the Schiitzen f est . " " What shall I be expected to do ? " " Nothing . You 'll just be there to look after the boys . You 'll love the procession . It 's pretty . We 're very fond of these occasions here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There 's no chasing . Those boys will tell their tales . " She was smiling her simple happy smile , which was meant to assure me that everything was well . The next morning we set out for the shooting festival . I could get little sense out of the boys . Dagobert was toop203excited and kept running around shouting bang and killing , I supposed , imaginary stags . Fritz was silent , a little apprehensive . As we were not coming home for food Frau Graben had told us we must stop at one of the inns in the town where we were to leave our horses . Here the very pretty innkeeper 's daughter served us with a sort of cider ale , a long cool drink and what was called a Schinkenbrot which was several slices of boiled bacon on thickish brown bread and butter . As we were eating crowds began to fill the oberer Stadtplatz ; wagons decorated with flowers trundled in from the surrounding country and in them sat the girls in their black skirts and yellow satin aprons . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reds , blues , blacks , and yellows , calling to the girls as they walked . Some were on horseback ; there were fiddlers to provide music , and some were singing . Dagobert said that we were to go to the Schiitzenhaus without delay because we must be there before the processioncame in . There was a special place which his father had said was to be kept for us . Dagobert led the way and we came to a building near the town hall . As we entered a man in uniform approached us ; he evidently knew the boys because he led us to seats near a platform where we sat down . We could hear the sounds of the band and singing as the procession was coming nearer . Dagobert kept looking at me to see how impressed I was . Now the hall began to fill with people . Tall men each carrying a rifle were then led in by a man in a green doublet . Dagobert whispered to me that he was the Schiitzen Konig . He was elected each year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was king ; and the medals he wore on his green doublet were given to him by the kings of other years . Into the hall began to file representatives from the surrounding villages all come to see the shooting contest . Although the men and women in their colorful costumes kept crowding in , the center of the hallp204and the space at one end opposite the dais were kept clear . In this space was a pole on which what appeared to be a bird was set up . Fritz whispered that it was not a real bird ; it was made of wood and the feathers had been stuck on . There was anew bird every year for the Schutzen f est . Now there was a great fanfare of trumpets because the ducal party was about to arrive . I was very excited . I should see the Count the children 's father who , through them , had become a legendary figure to me . I noticed the effect the sound of the trumpets had on them . They sat in awed silence beside me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung open . Two heralds came in  --  boys of about fourteen in the blue and gold which I knew to be the colors of the ducal livery . As they blew a fanfare on their trumpets all the people in the hall rose to their feet . The Duke entered . I recognized him at once as the man whose picture I had seen all those years ago . Even the cloak about him was the same as in the picture . It was of blue velvet lined with miniver . Immediately behind him were a man and two women . I felt my heart begin to hammer ; the room swung round me , and for a moment I was afraid that I would faint . I had thought in that moment that I had found Maximilian . The man was like him . . . the same height , the same build . But it was not he . I had been mistaken . I had known him so well during those three days that every detail of his face was familiar to me , engraved on my memory forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor could I mistake anyone else for him for more than a second or two . What I had seen was only a resemblance . But it was undoubtedly there . And one of the women who was with him reminded me of Ilse , though as I looked closer I saw that the similarity was by no means as marked as that between the Count and Maximilian . This was like one of my dreams , I was going to wake up in a moment . The hall had suddenly become unbearably hotp205but I was shivering . I felt Fritz gripping my hand . I returned the pressure and took comfort . I was not dreaming . I looked at the boys ; their eyes were fixed on the man whom I had momentarily mistaken for Maximilian . I had realized at once that he was the Duke 's nephew and their father . I thought then : I 'm just imagining this . There is a slight resemblance , nothing more , and because above all things I want to see Maximilian again I see him in this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height and build . The ducal group had taken their seats on the dais . I kept staring at the Count . Now I could see the differences . He was a little darker than Maximilian ; his complexion was more ruddy ; his expression was different ; there was a touch of cruelty in his expression which I had never seen in Maximilian 's . Had it been there though ? And had I refused to see it ? This man had not the humorous expression which I had found so charming in Maximilian . His nose was longer , his mouth thinner . No , there was a strong resemblance but it was growing less the more I saw of him . And the woman who was with him  --  faintly like use , yes , but that was all . Dagobert gave me a fleeting look . I knew he wanted me to admire his father . I whispered : " Who is the lady now sitting beside the Duke ? " " The Prince 's wife Princess Wilhelmina . " " Where is the Prince ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin and he 's taking his place while he is away . " I nodded . The ceremony started , the object being to find the best shot of the year . The Schiitzen Konig of last year led the competitors in and presented them to the Duke ; they then began to shoot at the wooden bird , in order to bring it off the perch . The shots rang out as one by one the attempts were made . Only two of the contestants succeeded in bringing it off itsp206perch and loud applause followed these efforts ; then the two had to undergo a further test and the bird was replaced . In a short time one of them was proved the victor and proclaimedthe Schutzen Konig for the next year . Up on the dais the Family congratulated him and the Schutzen f est was over , but this was apparently only the beginning of the entertainment . The best was yet to come , Dagobert told me . The ducal party left the hall . As they came near us the Count looked in the boys ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which disturbed me and aroused my indignation . I was in a strange mood . For a few moments I had believed I had found that which I now knew I had come a long way to seek , and a bitter frustration swept over me . Perhaps that was why I felt this indignation and imaginedthat there was something insulting about the manner in which he gave me that cursory glance . " We 're going out into the forest now for the real hunt , " said Dagobert . " I do n't feel well , " said Fritz . I looked at him anxiously . " Perhaps we had better all go home . " " No ! " cried Dagobert . " Our father would be angry . You dare n't , Fritz . You know it . " " Yes , " agreed Fritz , " I do . " " If you are not well we should go back to Klocksburg , " I said . " I will go with you and take the responsibility . " " I wo n't go , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Fritz . But I could see that he wanted to . We went to the inn where the horses had been watered and then set out from there . Many people were making their way into the forest . About half a mile in we came to a spot where a crowd had gathered and our horses were taken from us by one of the foresters . The boys seemed to be well known and the crowds parted to let us ride through . Then I saw what looked like a large tent . There were four sides of canvas round an enclosed space which was open to the skyp207and as we approached a man who seemed to be standing on guard lifted a flap in the canvas and we went inside the enclosure . In the center of this was a kind of pavilion which was beautifully decorated with flowers and leaves ; some of these were made into garlands and wreaths and the effect was delightful . There were seats in the pavilion and we were assigned to three of these . " What is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his lips but I saw that Fritz had grown pale . I knew that something was about to take place which he knew would upset him . I turned to speak to him but as I did so I heard the fanfare again and now others were coming into the enclosure . The Duke was not with them this time but the boys ' father and the two women  --  one of whom had reminded me of Ilse  --  were there . They led the party . Again I received that quick appraising look and instinctively I knew that that was the manner in which he looked at every woman . I thought of the mothers of these two boys and little Liesel who had most certainly been assessed in the same way and instinctively I disliked this man who had dared raise my hopes and fill me with great joy only to let me discover that he was not the man I sought . Fritz had moved a little nearer to me . I reached for his hand and pressed it . Dagobert 's shining eyes were fixed on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied and the Count clapped his hands . Everyone stood up and I saw that they all had guns in their hands . Some of them standing near the canvas then let out bloodcurdling cries ; the flap was lifted and numbers of stags and hinds dashed into the enclosure . I heard the rifles crack and I saw the beautiful animals stretched out on the grass ; I could not bear to look . I glanced at Fritz whose eyes were tightly shut ; he was swaying slightly . I heard my own voice then . I was unaware that I had spoken . " It 's horrible  --  butchery ! "  |p208I  took Fritz by the hand and drawing aside the canvas I dragged him away from the scene of the slaughter . I had forgotten Dagobert . My one thought was to look after Fritz whose feelings were mine . I had rarely been so shaken in my life as when I saw those innocent beautiful creatures run forward to their deaths . I found our horses . The man who was guarding them looked at me strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klocksburg . Will you go and tell Master Dagobert to come to us at once . " Fritz was visibly trembling as he mounted his pony ; I hope I managed to hide that I was similarly disturbed . In a very short time one , of the foresters came out with Dagobert . The boy looked stunned . As we rode away he said : " My father is very angry . " I hope I did not show my dismay . I was well aware that both boys were watching me closely  --  Fritz as a kind of deliverer but one in whose powers he had little confidence ; Dagobert as a stranger who had behaved in a reckless manner through ignorance rather than courage . The journey back to Klocksburg was made in almost complete silence after that . When we arrived I went straight to my room and it was not long before Frau Graben was knocking at my door . " You left the pavilion ! But nobody leaves the pavilion before the Family party ! " " We did , " I said . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something which might well be unforgivable she could not hide her secret amusement . Her expression was like that I had surprised when she was watching the spiders in the basin . " It 's a mercy the Duke was not there . " " That would have been lese majesty I suppose . " " That would have been a very serious matter . " " And what would have happened to me ? Should I have been put before a shooting squad ? "  |p209She  smiled . " I do n't know what will come of this , " she said . " We 'll have to see . I heard from Dagobert that his father looked like thunder . I used to call my two when they were little Donner and Blitzen . I never saw such rages as young Fredi could fall into . Talk about thunder . And the Prince he was like lightning  --  into everything  --  wildly enthusiastic and all for it one minute and tiring quickly . Yes , Donner and Blitzen was my name for them . " " I suppose I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . Then she began to talk about her two charges the cousins  --  the Count and the Prince . There never had been such children according to her . The mischief . It was one body 's work just to get them out of that . I gathered that the Prince was her favorite . Little Lightning was slightly more lovable than young Thunder . But I was not really paying attention ; I was wondering what was going to happen . It was almost certain that I should be asked to pack and leave . The Count would certainlynot want someone who had shown him such disrespectto teach his children . I went up to the turret room . Somehow it seemed to offer me a little solace . I looked across the valley down on thetown where we had seen the Schutzen f est that afternoonand beyond to the forest where that nauseating slaughter had taken place , and terrible depression swept over me . If I left here now I would never know the answer I had come to seek . The manner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival here had seemed to me like a pattern ; it reminded me of the manner in which use had appeared . There was something uncanny about it . It was like one of the fantastic adventures in which the gods and heroes of the forest indulged . I had changed since I had been here . I was growing more and more like that lightheartedgirl who had wandered into the mist and I had felt certain that I was going to unravel the mystery and makep210the discovery which was necessary to my peace of mind . And if I were sent away that would be the end . Perhaps I could go to the Damenstift and offer myself as a teacher of English as I had thought of doing once before . But I wanted to stay here ; I was growing fond of the children , particularly Fritz . The restricted life in a convent was not appealing ; its only virtue would be that I was here near that enchanted forest where once long ago I had walked into a dream . . . or was it reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was in the turret room with the children while we were at the window practicing English vocabulary we saw a little cavalcade of riders ; they were coming up the mountain road which led to Klocksburg . Dagobert shouted : " It 's my father . " My spirits sank . He had wasted little time . I said the boys should go to their rooms to wash their hands and prepare to receive him . I went to mine to preparemyself for the worst . I was summoned down to the Rittersaal . I left the fortress , crossed the courtyard and entered the Randhausburg . My knees were trembling but I held my head high and I knew there was an unusual color in my cheeks . I hope I did not show how agitated I was . I tried to calm myself . I was telling myself : You will be dismissed , but if they do n't want you , you could stay on for a while living humbly perhaps in some mountain inn and then perhaps teach at the Damenstift . He was seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the waist as the boys did , clicking his heels as he did so . He looked magnificent in the uniform of the Duke 's Guards . I felt like a drab little wren beside a peacock . " Miss er . . . " he began . " Trant , " I supplied . " Miss Trant , we met for the first time yesterday . "  |p211His  English was good ; there was only the faintest trace ofaccent . His voice unnerved me ; it was very like Maximilian 's . " You are here to teach my children English , " he went on . " That is so . " " They do not appear to have made much progress . " " On the contrary I would say that they are making excellentprogress . They only had a word or two of the languagewhen I arrived . Their education in that direction having been entirely neglected . " I was bold . I felt I had nothing to loose . He had determined to be rid of me ; and because I found his bold glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmness which I knew he would think of as insolent . He sat down at the refectory table on which pewter utensils stood . " You may sit , " he said . I did so because although I resented the manner in which he gave me permission to do so I could see that I should be at a disadvantage if I remained standing . " So you found the children ignorant ? " he said . " As regards English certainly . " " And since you have come they have made such rapid strides in this that when I asked them to tell me in English what they had thought of yesterday 's performance they were completely tongue-tied . " " That might well be beyond their powers at present . " " It was not beyond your powers to let us know what you thought . " " I suppose I gave a good indication . " " You left us in no doubt that you considered us a country of barbarians . " He waited for my reply but I made none . He insisted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacle revolting . " " Indeed ? " " Is it so surprising ? " " Ah , English susceptibilities ! Your Queen was equally unimpressed . . . or perhaps impressed . I was present whenp212she was entertained over here . Her remarks were identical . Butchery ! ' she said . " " Then I was in noble company . " " You do not seem to set much store by that . You were in noble company yesterday but you behaved in an exceedinglydiscourteous manner . If it were not for the fact that you are a foreigner and can plead ignorance it might be necessary to reprimand you very severely . " " I realize that I have committed a breach of etiquette and for that I apologize . " " That is indeed gracious . " " Had I known what I was expected to witness I should not have come . " " You were commanded to come . " " Still I should have declined . " " Those who serve us do not decline to obey commands . " " I suppose not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds such commands unacceptable , which is to resign from the service . " " Is that what you are doing , Miss Trant ? " " If it is your wish that I should do so , I have no alter-native . " " There is an alternative . You could plead to be forgiven . I might say you are a stranger , ignorant of our etiquette . Apologies could be made to the Princess , the Countess , and other members of the Court . On grounds of ignorance you might be forgiven , providing of course that you promise not to offend again . " " I could not give such a promise . If I were asked to witness that sickening spectacle once more I should be obliged to refuse . " " On your own behalf perhaps . But you carried my sons with you . Do you imagine that I can allow you to instil into them ideas that are detrimental to their manhood ? " I had visions of his forcing Fritz to witness such scenes , of trying as he would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No wonder the poor child was nervous ; no wonder he walkedp213in his sleep . I was ready to fight for Fritz as I had not been to fight for myself . I said earnestly : " Fritz is a sensitive boy . " " Why ? " he cried . " Because he has been brought up by women ? " " Because he has a highly strung nature . " " My dear Miss Trant , I have no patience with highly strung natures . I want to make a man of the boy . " " Is it manly to gloat over the slaughter of beautiful animals ? " " What strange ideas you have . I think perhaps you might do very well in a select academy for young ladies . " " Perhaps , " I said . " And you are telling me that I am dismissed . If that is so I will make my preparations to leave at once . " He stood up and came to my chair . He sat on the table very close to me . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think impetuous people make good teachers . " " Very well . I will go . " " But I have no personal objection to that characteristic . " " I am glad I do not displease you in all respects . " " It is not you who displease me , Miss Trant . It is your action yesterday . " I half-rose . His great virility alarmed me at such close quarters . He was so like Maximilian and yet there was the subtle difference . Had I been with him that night in the bunting lodge I would never have been allowed to remain alone on the other side of that locked door . That was something I knew instinctively . " I see that I have offended you , " I said quickly . " There is no need to continue this interview . I will go . " " You make a custom of taking your leave unexpectedly It is my custom to give permission for those whom I employto come or go . " " I presume I am no longer in your employ so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was beside me . I could feel his warm breath on my neck . He caught my forearm in a tight grip . " You will stay , " he said . Then he smiled , his eyes slightly veiled as they swept over me . " I have decided that you shallhave another chance , " he went on . I faced him boldly . " I warn you that in similar circumstancesI should act in the same way . " " We 'll see , " he said . I took his hand from my arm and dropped it hastily ; he was so surprised that he made no effort to check me . I said : " Whenever you wish me to leave your employ , please say so . " And with that I walked out of the Rittersaal . I crossed the courtyard and entered the fortress . I was trembling but I felt elated as though I had won a battle , which perhaps in a way I had because at least I was still employed at Klocksburg . I sat by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shaken me because the bold message in theCount 's eyes told me he had marked me down for a victim . I was experienced enough to recognize his intentions . I was surprised . I had ceased to think of myself as an attractive woman . I knew I had been so in my teens , with my somewhatinconsequential high spirits , my masses of dark hair and perhaps most of all my vivacious expression . But when I had believed myself to be married and had borne a child ( at least I could be sure of that ) and lost it , I had changed . I knew the change was remarkable because Mrs. Greville and Aunt Matilda often said to me : " I 've never seen anyone change as you did when you came back from that long stay abroad . " My gaiety had been overshadowed ; the tremendous doubt was there . I had loved and lost my husband and my child , and who could be the same after such an experience ? Anthony it was true had asked me to marry him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left England . He had written twice  --  letters full of details about the parish and his work . I should have been interested a short while ago , but I had found my attention wandering even while I had been reading them . Ever since I had come to Klocksburg I had felt an excitementthat I had not known since I had wakened in my bed to be told that my marriage had been a dream , the result of Dr. Carlsberg 's treatment . There was a firm belief within me that if ever I was to find the solution to my mystery I should find it here . For a second when I had seen the Count I had believed I had found it . But that was a delusion ; and now this very Count was becoming an obstaclein my way . I could guess what would happen . I was woman enough of the world to grasp the type of man he was ; and because he was powerful in his little world he would have encounteredlittle opposition and at first he would be attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would soon begin to pall . Perhaps I should begin making inquiries at the Damensti f t . As I brooded I heard voices below , for one could hear very distinctly in that clear mountain air . " Now , Master Fredi , you 'll behave yourself . I 'll not allow any of your games . " That was Frau Graben , the lilt of laughter in her voice ; I could imagine the fat comfortable smile . " What was the meaning of this , eh , old woman ? Why did you bring her here ? " The Count ! The arrogant powerful man allowing Frau Graben to address him in that way . But of course the old nurse had special privileges . " It was about time those bastards of yours were given a hit of education . " " They had it . We did n't need an English prude to give them that . " " Not so prudish , Master Fredi . I 'll promise you . " " And who are you to make promises to me ? "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always telling you . " " Good God , woman , I 'm not in the nursery now . " " You 'll always be in the nursery as far as I 'm concernedand that goes for your high and mighty cousin too . " " He was always your favorite . " " You get along with you . I had no favorites . You were both my boys and I would n't let you give me your sauce then and I wo n't now . " " I should have had you turned out of Klocksburg long ago . " Then who 'll look after your bastards ? " " Why , you old witch , there are hundreds who 'd like the opportunity . " " But you trust your old Nana , eh ? " " No farther than the end of the Randhausburg . " " Listen to me , Master Fredi , you turn your gaze away from Miss Trant . " " You brought her here . " " Not for your amusement . " " I 'll decide where and when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , master . " " Who 's to stop me ? You ? " " No . She will though . She 's not for you . " " Who said I was interested ? " " You were always interested in a fresh face  --  both of you . Do n't I know you ? Old Nana likes you to enjoy yourselves , but not Miss Trant , Master Fredi . She 's in my care . So you give your thoughts to that little innkeeper 's daughter I 've been hearing about . " " Trust you to hear everything . " She gave a high-pitched giggle . He said : " Do n't you dare try to dictate to me , you mischievous old woman . " They went inside the Randhausburg and I heard no more.  |p217I  was indignant that I should be discussed in this way . I had already a notion of the Count 's intentions  --  which were after all only the same as he would have toward any woman  --  but what astonished me was the familiar manner in which Frau Graben addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here to teach the boys Englishhad come from her . When the Count had left I went to the Randhausburg and knocked at Frau Graben 's door . The air of excitement lingered about her ; she looked as though she had just come from a highly diverting entertainment . " Come in , my dear , " she said . She was seated on her rocking chair nibbling a piece of spiced cake . " Sit down . Would you like some tea ? " It was though she were placating me . Tea ! The English could always be pacified with it ! " No thank you . " " " I know . A glass of wine . I had some sent to me from the Moselle Valley . It 's good stuff . " " No refreshment thank you . I really wanted to talk to you seriously . " " Oh , you 're too serious , Miss Trant . " " A woman on her own has to be . " " You 're not on your own . You 've got that nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverendgentleman . " She looked slyly knowledgeable . I was beginning to think that she knew more about me than I had imagined . But of course she had stayed in Oxford ; while she was there she would have fallen into conversation with the shop people , and people at her hotel , anyone who might know something about me . But how could she ? She spoke very little English . I said : " How did you know . . . ? " " One picks up these things . You must have told me during some of our little chats. "  | I said : " Did you decide that it would be a good idea for me to come over and teach the children ? I mean was it entirely your idea ? " " There 'd been talk . And when I was in England I thought you were just the one . " She leaned toward me , nibbling . " I took a fancy to you . I did n't want to lose you . I wanted you to be here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the moment we met . " Those powerful men whose nurse she had been must clearly be fond of her , otherwise they would not allow her such power . I remembered the manner in which she had spoken to the haughty Count , and now it seemed she had the power to bring an English teacher into his household without consulting him . There was evidently a softer side to the Count 's nature since he was so affectionate toward his old nurse . " So you are allowed to add to the household if you wish ? " " I was a mother to them . There 's not always the time or inclination in people like them to look after their children . Those that are nurses to them are like their mothers . We 're a sentimental race , you know . Those who have been mothers to us mean a great deal to us . " I was surprised . I had always known that I owed my presence here to Frau Graben but I did not think it was so completely so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said to me , " I 'm going to look after you . " The words were comforting , but there was that glint in her eyes  --  something of the amusement and speculation which I had seen there when she was watching the spiders . The Count lost no time in coming to Klocksburg . We were in the turret room where I had made a habit of taking the children  --  not for the written exercises I gave them , but for our conversations . I would make them tell me aboutthe ducal palace and then I would translate it into English . As they were greatly interested in the palace and every/thing that went on there , this meant that I had their full attention . He came in and the children all rose to their feet  --  the boys bowing , Liesel dropping a pretty curtsy . He waved a hand indicating that he preferred them to be seated . " Please continue , Miss Trant , " he said . " I want to see how the lesson progresses . " I was determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I could help it . " Now , " I said , " there is the Watching Tower . Fritz , will you please say that in English ? " He stammered a little but I was not displeased with the result . Then I asked Dagobert in English to point out the barracksand tell me who lived there . He was particularly interested in the soldiers , so I felt safe there . I asked Liesel to show me the big bell and tell me when it was rung . They stammered through and I continued with the lesson , but I can hardly say that the children were at their best . Iagobert was soon trying to show off , Fritz grew nervous , and Liesel was a little silly . The Count sat smiling superciliously . I could see that he was not impressed by the performance . " You 'll have to do better than that , " he said , " if you want to be presented to Her Majesty Queen Victoria when she deigns to pay us another visit . " Dagobert said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , come . She was with us a few years ago . You must not expect too much from such mighty folk . I have no doubt that Miss Trant has told you that her country is the greatest in the world and we are just a poor little state in comparison . " Dagobert stared open-mouthed at me and Fritz stammered : " M . . . Miss T . . . Trant did n't tell us that . She ... she likes our country . " I was touched . It was an effort to protect me.  |p220I  said sharply : " I have not come to teach politics , Herr Count . I have come to teach English . " " With the natural assumption that the whole world recognizeswithout any prompting from its subjects the superiority of Britain . " " You pay us a great compliment , " I said . " I believe it was said you did the same to us when you allowed your Queen to take a husband from one of our Houses . " " It linked our countries , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Perhaps on both sides . " " You are determined to be gracious . " " It makes social life so much more comfortable . " " Even when one does not say exactly what one means ? " " I try to say what I mean . " " And only prevaricate for expediency . I believe that is a good old English custom . " " It 's frequently considered to be a diplomatic one , I be-lieve . " I looked at my watch . " Pastor Kratz will be waiting for you , " I said to the children . They were surprised . I realized then that until the Count dismissed them we were supposed to remain where we were and Pastor Kratz could wait all morning if necessary . I rose . To my surprise so did the Count . " You speak German better than you teach English , " he said . " It is unwise to judge on such slight evidence , " I retorted . " My German could be better and I believe that in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I took Liesel by the hand and led her to the door . The Count followed , so the boys came on behind . We reached the schoolroom where Pastor Kratz was wait/ing . I went in to have a word with him and the Count sent the children in after me . When I came out he had gone . Encounters with him disturbed me . He was determined to be critical and yet at the same time he was interested in me . Our badinage amused him . I had always been able to hold my own in such conversations and when I was stimulated I felt these powers increase . I enjoyed my verbal battles . I had even enjoyed that one this morning for I did not think I had come out of it too badly . I knew what was going to happen . He was attracted by me . I must seem different from the women he would meet . I was a foreigner for one thing ; he wanted to subdue me partly on this account . He had evidently been impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leiningen , and the surrounding states  --  and who would not be ? Never had such a tiny person been able to display such regality . On the occasions when I had seen her I had been impressed by it  --  not that I had seen her often for since the death of the Prince Consort she had shut herself away and had rarely been seen by her subjects . I knew though that she had visited Germany after his death , and I could imagine the effect that unconscious royal dignity would have on a man like the Count . Moreover , she was a great Queen , with a growing Empire , and he was the nephew of the Duke of an insignificant state . How he would have reveled in her position ! He would not see that it was natural acceptance of her royalty which gave her such presence . How did I know so much about him ? But he was easy to read . And this I knew : He was planning to seduce me . He betrayed that completely . He was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a little while . He would enjoy being repulsed at first ; but not for long . I thought of those beautiful deer ; the destruction of the fleetest and most difficult to ensnare would provide the greatest enjoyment . But he would soon tire of the chase . And then he would be angry . He would find fault with me . I should be dismissed.  |p222This  had happened to a friend of mine-one of the girls who had been with me at the Damenstift . She was exceptionallypretty and without means . She had become a governess . The master of the house had pursued her and when she had repulsed him at first he had been intrigued ; but very soon she was looking for another post and had only a very indifferent testimonial to help her . Life had become very uneasy since the appearance of the Count . In the Randhausburg there was a garden . It was rather beautiful , shut in by stubby firs and containing a lawn with a fountain and seats painted white . Here the children practiced their shooting and archery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop from the plateau but the hedge of bushy firs made it safe for even little Liesel to wander in alone . It was a favorite spot of mine and I often went there . So this morning I took some books intending to work out my next lesson , but I suppose really to brood on my situationand to wonder whether I should begin making inquiries about a position at the Damenstift . I was sitting with my back to the little gate which had been set up in the hedge of firs when I heard the latch click . Instinctively I knew who it was . " Why Miss Trant . " He pretended to be surprised but I knew that he had seen me come here . " Have you any objection to my sitting beside you , " he asked , with an irony which I pretended to ignore . " Please sit here if you wish . " " This is a pleasant garden , " he went on . " Very pleasant . " " I am glad you find it so . And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would hardly describe it as little . " " Oh but not to be compared with Windsor Castle , BuckinghamPalace , and , is it Sandringham ? "  | " There is such a palace and one could not really compareKlocksburg with them . They are quite dissimilar . " " And much more grand , eh ? " " I find it difficult to make these comparisons . Personally I live in a small house next to a bookshop . I can assure you that is not in the least like Klocksburg either . " " A small house next to a bookshop , " he said . " But a very superior small house next to a very superior bookshop , I daresay . " " I found it pleasant because it was my home . It is a good bookshop too . " " Do you think longingly of your home , Miss Trant ? " " Not yet . Perhaps I have not been away long enough . " " I fancy you have a fondness for our mountains . " I assured him that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I was interested to see that you had decided to throw open our haunted room . " " I thought it wiser to open it than keep it shut . Frau Graben agreed with me . " " It has been locked for several years , but you sweep away our traditions with an imperious wave of your English hand . ' " I must explain about the locked room . " " I look forward to your explanations , Miss Trant . " " The room was kept locked , " I said . " Therefore it was given a certain eerie aura . I believed that if it were open the idea that it was haunted would vanish . It would be shown to be just a room  --  nothing more . And this is what is happen-ing . " " Bravo ! " he said . " St. George and the dragon  --  only this time we have a St. Georgiana . With her cool common sense broom she sweeps away our medieval cobwebs of superstition . That 's the case is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " " We like our fancies you know . We are said to be so un/imaginative , but are we really ? You tell me , Miss Trant . You know so much about us " " I must dispute that . " I had half-risen . " You are not going ? " He said it as a question but his eyes made it a statement . He took my wrist and held it so firmly that I could not release it . Rather than attempt and fail I sat down . " Pray tell me how you came here ? " he said . I told him about Frau Graben 's coming into the shop , how we had spoken in German because her English was not very good . " We grew friendly , " I said . " She thought it would be a good idea if I came out to teach the children English , so I came . " " What is she up to ? " he murmured . " I think she thought it would be good for the children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to come by , " he mocked . " Frau Graben thought a native would be best to teach the language . " He narrowed his eyes . " Well , " he said at length , " I 'm glad she brought you over . " " I had the impression that you did not greatly admire my teaching ability . " " But there are some things I do admire about you . " " Thank you . " I rose again . " If you will excuse me . " " No , " he said . " I will not . I have made it very clear thatI wish to talk to you . " " I can not understand what we should have to talk about except the children 's progress in English and we have discussedthat already . " " That was a not very inspiring topic , " he said . " I am sure we have greater points of interest . I find you amusing . " I raised my eyebrows . " That is what I call mock surprise ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not become good friends . " " I see many reasons . " " What are they ? " " Your elevated position for one thing . Are n't you the nephew of the Duke ? You have already seen that my knowledge of protocol is negligible . " " It is easily acquired . " " No doubt by those in the position to do so . As an English teacher  --  even though a parent of my charges is in a very exalted position  --  I could hardly expect noble etiquette to concern me . " " It could concern you if I wished it . " " Oh but surely that would be another breach of the social code . After all , I am not even teaching your legitimate offspring . " He leaned toward me . " Would you care to ? It could be arranged . " " I am happy with the present arrangement . " " Your cool English airs delight me . You behave as though I am a customer in the er . . . bookshop , was it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell my services as a teacher ; you as my employer are buying them . " " Ours is a more lengthy transaction surely . " " You would be surprised how many customers come back and back again in bookshops . " " I think you and I are going to be on closer terms . What do you think ? Or have n't you thought about it yet ? " " I do not have to think very long . I know that our respective positions and characters make a close acquaintanceimpossible . " He was taken slightly aback and I felt the victory was mine particularly as the gate clicked again and there stood Frau Graben smiling at us . " I knew you were here , " she said . " Miss Trant , Pastor Kratz wants to talk to you ... something about changingp226the time of tomorrow 's lesson . Fredi , I wanted a word with you . He frowned at her . " Oh you can frown Herr Donner , " she said . " You know I wo n't have tantrums . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat smile as she prepared to do battle with the Count . I was reminded of Hildegarde , my guardian angel of the hunting lodge . My thoughts were in a turmoil for the rest of the day . I knew that relentless obstinacy of men like Count Frederic . I could picture his riding through the countryside , selecting the women who took his fancy briefly . He had believed that I would be so overawed by his importance , so beguiled by his masculine chain , that I would be the next victim . If , in spite of my attitude he still believed he could overcome my resistance , he was mistaken . More vividly than ever there came back to me that day when Maximilian had loomed out of the mist . Could it really have been that he had been such another as this man ? I was now ten years older than that girl who had been so deeply impressed , who had fallen so much in love with the hero of the forest that she had never forgotten him even though there were times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had I endowed him with the qualities of the heroes of his country 's legends ? Was the picture I had treasured for so many years only one of my own painting ? If ten years ago the Count had shared that adventure would I have believed him to possess those qualities with which I had endowed Maximilian ? When I went into the schoolroom after the Count had left there was a babble of excitement among the children . They were going hunting tomorrow with the Count . " Who told you that ? " I asked . " The Count did , " said Dagobert . " He is coming for us at nine o'clock . " Dagobert 's eyes shone with excitement but I detectedp227a trace of apprehension . Even he was afraid that he could not match up to his father 's expectations . As for Fritz I could see that he was in a state of terror . I guessed that after what had happened in the pavilion during the slaughterof the deer , he would be expected , as his father would put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if this were not the purpose of the exercise . The child sensed this I believed and was very disturbed about it . Liesel would not accompany them of course . She was going to watch them ride off . There would be a party of them and they were going to hunt boar , the most dangerouscreatures of the forest . Boars could be really vicious , Dagobert told me . " My father likes hunting boar . " " Say it in English please , Dagobert , " I said automatically . That night footsteps awakened me again . Stealthily they went past my door . This time I immediately thought of Fritz . I listened to which direction they were going . It was not to the turret room this time . Hastily I lighted my candle , put on my slippers and wrapped my dressing gown about me . By the time I had done this I could no longer hear the footsteps . But I knew that they had descended the stairs . I went down the spiral staircase , through the narrow passages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door was open . I hurried to it and I saw the small figure walking steadily toward the stables . I ran . Fritz was at the stable door ; he was trying to open it . I caught him . The blank expression of the sleepwalker was on his face . I took him gently by the hand and led him back to the fortress . Although it was summer and the days warm , the temperature dropped considerably at night and his hand was icily cold . I led him carefully to his room . He was shivering ; his feet were chilled ; he wore nothing but hisp228nightshirt . He was murmuring something : " No . . . please no . " And there was such fear in those words that I was sure I knew what was troubling him . Tomorrow he was to go out hunting wild boar with his father : and he was afraid . That would explain why he had gone to the stables . I felt a fury against this insensitive man who did not understand that he had a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fritz 's mental capacity ; but becauseof this he was imaginative in a manner which men such as the Count could not understand . I leaned over Fritz . I said : " It 's all right , Fritzi . " He opened his eyes . He said : " Mutter . . . " Then , " Miss . . . " " Hello , Fritz . Yes , I 'm here . " " Did I walk ? " " A little . . . " He began to shiver . I said : " It 's all right . Lots of people do it . I heard you and brought you back to bed . " " You heard me last time . Dagobert heard them talking about it . " " I 've got a special pair of ears for you . " That made him laugh . " Tomorrow , Fritz , " I said , " you 're not going to the hunt . " " Did my father say . . . ? " " I said you 're not . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can , " I said . " Your feet are like ice . I 'm going to put an extra blanket on . And tomorrow morning you 're to stay in bed . You 're a little chilled . And you wo n't get up until it 's too late to go with the hunters . " " Can I , miss . Who says . . . ? " " I say , " I said firmly . In some way I had won his confidence . He believed me . I stayed by his bed until he fell into a peaceful sleep which was in a very short time.  |p229Then  I went back to my room and tried to sleep . I must be ready for the battle which would surely come the next morning . I watched the Count and his party riding up to the Schloss , and steeling myself went down and out of the fortress to the Randhausburg . Dagobert was already there in his riding outfit . As he was greeting his father I slipped inside and waited in the Rittersaal . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should never win if we had spectators because he was the sort of man who would never concede if observed . He had seen me enter and , as I knew he would , he quickly followed me there . " Good morning , Miss Trant , " he said . " How gracious of you to come down to greet my party . " " I did so because I wanted to speak to you about Fritz . " " The boy , I suppose , is waiting to leave with us . " " No . I have told him to stay in bed for the morning . He was chilled last night . " He stared at me in astonishment . " Chilled ! " he cried . " In bed ! Miss Trant , what do you mean ? " " Exactly what I say . Last night Fritz walked in his sleep . I gathered he does this when he is disturbed . He is a sensitive child , studious rather than athletic . " " That seems to me all the more reason why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up at once and that I am angry because he was not ready and eager to go to hunt the boar . " " Would you have him pretend to feel something he does n't ? " " I would have him hide his cowardice and pretend to a little courage . " " He is no coward , " I said fiercely . " No ? When he cowets behind the skirts of his teacher ? "  | " I must make this clear . It was on my orders that he stayed in bed this morning . " " So you give orders here now , Miss Trant ? " " It is essential for the teacher to tell her pupils what to do . " " Even when it is to disobey a parent ? " " It did not occur to me that any parent would want to drag a sick child from his bed . " " How dramatic you are , Miss Trant ! I did not think that an English characteristic . " " I daresay it is not , but I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he will enjoy the hunt and he will not be tortured by an overactive imagination . You can make of him the sort of man you admire  --  someone in your own image . " " Thank you for that assessment of my character , Miss Trant . " " I think you understand perfectly that I would not presumeto assess your character on such a short acquaintance , or , in fact , at all . I came here to teach children English and ... " " And their father how to treat his children . His idiosyncraciesare no concern of yours , you say . Yet you belie this . Because now you are telling me how wrong my attitude is toward my son . " " Will you do this for me ? " I asked . His expression changed . He came closer . I held up a hand as though to ward him off and I went on quickly : " Do not insist that Fritz go to this hunt today . Please give me a chance with him . He is nervous and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to soothe it , to show him that a great deal that he fears lies only in his mind . " " You talk like one of these new-fangled doctors one hears of nowadays . But you 're a good advocate . What has Fritz done to deserve such concern ? " " He is a child who needs understanding . Please , will you allow me to have my way over this ? "  | " I 've an idea , Miss Trant , that you are a young woman who often gets her way . " " You are wrong in that . " " Then you should be grateful to me . " I was suddenly thinking happily of Fritz 's relief when he heard the party riding away into the forest . " You are charming when you smile , " he said . " It gives me pleasure to be responsible for such charm . " " I am grateful , " I said . He bowed . He took my hand then and kissed it ; I took it from his grasp as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I went up to Fritz 's room . He started as I entered . I said , " The party is just leaving . Would you like to see them go ? We can watch from the window . " He looked at me as though I were a magician . He stood at the window and watched the cavalcade ride out of the Schloss grounds down the slopes into the pine forest . I sat by Fritz 's bed and gave him a lesson in English . He sneezed once or twice and I went down to Frau Graben to tell her I thought he had a cold . She brought up her own remedy  --  a cordial she made herself . She smacked her lips as she took a spoonful of it . " Lovely ! " she said , beaming . Fritz knew the cordial well and took it with relish . It made him sleepy , so I left him and went for a walk in the woods , but not very far from the Schloss . I had no desire to run into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back and went to sit in the garden to prepare next day 's lesson ; it was peaceful there , shut in as it was by the short thick firs . One of the two girls , Ella , who looked after us in the fortress , came down to tell me that Frau Graben had sent a message over to ask me to go to her sitting room.  | I went ; she had a little spirit lamp which she used in the summer and the kettle was boiling . " Tea , " she said once again , as though I were a small child to whom she was offering a treat . I noticed the new addition to the room  --  a blue gilded cage in which was a canary . " Look at my little angel , " she said . " ' Angel , ' that is his name . Tweet , tweet . Is n't he a little treasure ? I saw him in a shop in the unterer Stadtplatz yesterday . I could n't resist buying him and bringing him home . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to hear him talk ? Come , little Angel . Say Frau Graben . . . ' Say Hello , mi " s . ' Stubborn , eh ? Well , my little man , we 'll see . " " You like . . . " I was going to say animals , but I suppose one could not call canaries or spiders animals . . . I substituted " living things . " Her eyes sparkled . " I like to know what they 'll do . You can never be sure . I like to see for myself . " " What happened to your spiders ? " " One killed the other . " " And then ? " " I let the winner go . It seemed only right . I guessed that 's what would happen but you never know . . . with living things they can do just the opposite to what others in the same case have done before them . Tweet , tweet , my Angel . Come on , talk for Frau Graben . " The canary gave voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried . " But what I really wanted my pet was for you to talk . " She smiled at me . " Well , if he wo n't that does n't mean we ca n't . There . The kettle 's boiling . I 'll make the tea and we 'll get cozy . " Over the cups she said : " Well , so Fritzi did n't go . You could have knocked me down with a feather . What did Fredi have to say to you ? " " I told him that Fritz was a sensitive child . This sleepwalkingworries me . It happens when he is disturbed . Hep233was worried last night about this hunt . . . so he walks in his sleep . He is a very clever boy . We do n't want him upset . " " And you told Fredi all this ? " " I did . " " And he gave way ! It 's a bad sign . It shows that he likes you . " Is it so bad to be liked by the Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's tricky . He 's a libertine of the first degree . It 's a way of life with them . They 've heard the stories of their parents and grandparents . We 're a lusty nation , Miss Trant ; and we 're divided into these states which seem small to you but the heads of them have great power . . . they and their families . It 's not good for young men . In the past they 've had their pick of the village maidens and took it as a right . The boys have been brought up to this . The history of our reigning families is one of seduction in various ingenious forms . The most popular through the last century or so was the mock marriage . There 's our legend here of the haunted room that you decided to unhaunt . You see what I mean about taking the Count 's fancy ? A young woman 's not safe when she does that . " " I am not a particularly young woman . " " Now , Miss Trant , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twenties you 've gained something on the way . But I must warn you about some of our gentlemen . " " I think I know how to deal with them . " " Fredi can be forceful . " " I think I shall know how to behave . " Fran Graben seemed satisfied . She beamed and handed me the spiced cakes . I took one and nibbled at it . It was very rich . " Well , " she said , " he 'll soon be on duty at the Duke 's Schloss . The Prince is coming home . There 'll be a special procession to the church to welcome him back . I think it will be in a week or so . " " Where has he been ? " I asked  | " He 's been to Berlin to take part in a conference there . There 's talk about the French getting very obstreperous . " " And Rochenstein would fight with Prussia ? " " If the French attacked us , all true Germans would stand together . So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him ride to the thanksgiving service . That 'll be a day . " " Very soon , I suppose . " " As soon as he gets home the Chamberlain will arrange it . You 'll see some crowds then . You 'll want to see the procession from the palace in the town to the church and back to the palace . " " Is the Prince very popular ? " " You know how it is with royalty . Sometimes they 're popular , sometimes not . You 'll see them riding through the streets and people shouting for them and the next day they have a bomb thrown at them . " " Does that often happen ? " " Shall we say it happens . They 're not safe . I was always terrified when my boys used to go out with their parents . In the first carriage would be the Duke and his lady and their son the Prince and in the next the Duke 's brother Ludwig and Fredi . Of course Ludwig was a traitor and came to his end ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people is to one person  --  themselves . You 'll have to go and see the thanksgiving service . They 'll get the Processional Cross out , and as you know that 's quite a ceremony . " It was indeed and I thought what a lot of trouble they had gone to just to show me . I shall never forget how they guarded it . There was a very pleasant soldier  --  Sergeant Franck I believe he was called . Someone must have mentioned his name . " " Oh , I know Sergeant Franck . A pleasant fellow . He was put to soldiering when quite a boy and I remember how proud his family were of him when he got into the Duke 's Guard . Then he married that wife of his . She 's changed . It just shows you what can happen . She was a poor fright/ened little thing when she married Franck . There 'd been some sort of past . . . but he took care of her and now she 's got two children and is very pleased with herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There they are and then life picks them up and puts them somewhere with someone else and you watch what happens from there . " " Like spiders , " I said . " Oh people are a lot more interesting than them . " I agreed . " I 'm glad he 's coming home when he is  --  the Prince I mean , " she went on . " It 's the right time , when you come to think of it . Oh , he 's a one , he is . Fredi always declares he was my favorite . I never had a favorite , ' I said . But that was n't really true . Thunder and Lightning , I said . I could n't imagine one without the other . The flash and the roar . That 's how they always seemed to me . I 'd like to be back in the days when they were little . The joy of my life they were ! Of course Ludwig , the Duke 's younger brother , wanted young Fredi brought up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as the Duke . Fredi 's Ludwig all over again . He always wanted to excel in every- ' thing and just as Ludwig wanted to outshine the Duke so Fredi wanted to do better than his cousin the Prince . What the Prince had , he wanted  --  all their toys I mean . It frightened me then . Toys when they 're young , and when they grow up , I used to say , what then ? It 'll be more than toys then . But you won this morning , did n't you ? You got your way about young Fritzi . My goodness , you 've done something for that child . You understand children . That 's strange really because there you are a spinster . . . " Her smiling eyes were intent on my face . " . . , and never having had one of your own . " I felt a slow flush creep into my cheeks . I could n't help it . She had conjured up so clearly a vision of that nursing home  --  the pregnant women chatting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gretchen I think her name was , Gretchen Swartz.  |p236I  had hesitated a second too long ; those bland smiling eyes missed very little I was sure . I said : " Understanding children is something one is born with , perhaps . " " Oh yes , of course , that is so . But when a woman has a child something happens to her , I think . I 've seen it happen . " Perhaps , " I said coolly . " Well , the Prince will be home in time for our great night . Oh you would n't know about this . We 're regular ones for celebrations . This is Loke 's land here . The Lokenwaldyou see . And in two weeks ' time the moon will be full . That 's the night for mischief . Loke was the God of Mischief and he 's abroad that night . I sha n't let you go out on that night , Miss Trant . " I shivered a little ; memories were unbearable . She leaned toward me and took my hand in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let you go out . It 's not safe . Something gets into people on that night . It 's Loke 's moon  --  the seventh of the year ; and there are people here who will be good Christians every night of the year , except the Night of the full Seventh Moon . Then they 're pagan again just as they were centuries ago before Christianity came to tame them down . Why , miss , I believe I 've frightened you . " I tried to laugh . " I 've heard of it , you know . I 've read of the gods and heroes . " " So , you do know something about our Night of the Seventh Moon after all ? " " Yes , " I said , " I know something . " The afternoon was hot and sunny . " We 'll all go down together , " said Frau Graben , " there 'll be such crowds I do n't want anyone to get trampled to death . " " Surely it 's not as bad as that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he 's back . "  |p237We  drove down into the town through the mountain roads which never failed to delight me . The orchids and gentians were in bloom , brightening the mountain slopes ; every now and then we came upon a plateau with a small farmhouse and heard the familiar tinkle of the cowbells . Down in the town the sun was shining on the mellowing rooftops ; the bells were ringing and as we came into the oberer Stadtplatz we were greeted by the gay sight of flags fluttering from every place where it was possible to put them . The men and women were in their native costumes and I guessed that hundreds of them had come in from the neighboring countryside . I was glad we had Frau Graben with us , for the children were very excited and I should have been afraid that they might stray away and get hurt in the crush . We drove to the inn where we had stabled our horses on another occasion and there a window looking onto the square in which was the church had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the procession undisturbed . The innkeeper treated Frau Graben with great respect . She evidently knew him well for she asked after his daughter . His eyes lit up at the mention of her and he clearly doted on her . " The prettiest girl in Rothenberg , " commentedFrau Graben , and I was aware of the sly speculative look in her eyes and wondered what it meant . Wine and little spiced cakes , at the sight of which Frau Graben 's eyes glistened , were brought out and there was some sweet drink for the children . Frau Graben was clearly as excited as the boys and Liesel . Dagobert kept telling me what everything signified ; Fritz , now completely devoted to me , kept near me and I was delighted because this was a spectacle he was going to enjoy . Liesel could not keep still , but Frau Graben seemed absorbed in some secret mirth which delighted her to such an extent that I got the impression that shep238was debating whether she would be more amused to share her mirth or keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; people called excitedlyto each other . The flags gaily fluttered at the windows . I recognized that of Rochenstein of course and the Prussian flag but most of the Austrian and German states were represented . A band started to play . In the obeyer Stadtplatz a choir was singing . I recognized the words which began : Unsern Ausgang segne Gott .. . " God bless our going out nor less our coming in . " My mother had taught me this . They sang it , she said , when they moved into a new house . I suppose it could now refer to the Prince 's visit to Prussia and his return home . In the distance I could hear the military band . " They 'll be coming from the palace now . You 'll see the Processional Cross , Miss Trant , " chortled Frau Graben . " I daresay there was a big ceremony getting it out of the crypt . " Yes , and taking it to the palace . Sergeant Franck was telling me about it . " " I shall look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to steal it . " Dagobert looked excited . " If they did I 'd run after them . I 'd kill them . I 'd get it back . " " Singlehanded ? " I asked . " All by myself , " went on Dagobert . " Then the Duke would send for me and he 'd say you 're my true son and you 'll come before Carl . . . " " Poor Carl ! " I said lightly . " It 's hard on him . After all to be set aside because he did n't recapture the Cross . Is that fair ? " " Nothing 's fair , " said Dagobert . " My father could be the Prince . . . " " Now , " said Frau Graben comfortably , " that 's enough of that talk , Dagobert . The Prince is the Duke 's son and true heir and little Carl the heir to follow him . That 's how it'sp239been arranged . You 're getting more like your father every day . Oh look , here 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine in their uniforms . " They did indeed  --  the brightly caparisoned horses with their waving plumes , the blue and gold uniforms and the glitter of helmets , the marching tunes of the band , the waving flags . The crowd was reduced to a momentary hush . Then the cheers broke out . On came the brilliant cavalcade and behind it members of the church in the long black and white robes . A soldier on horseback held the Processional Cross . It scintillated in the bright light ; the emeralds , rubies , and sapphires shone and the diamond sparkled with red and blue fire . This was the way in which to see it . I recognized Sergeant Franck riding on one side of it ; there was another stalwart soldier on the other . The silence as the Cross passed could only be construed as an awed huskAfter the Cross came the ducal coach . It was not unlike the pictures I had seen of our Queen 's coach , elaborately gilded and drawn by eight white horses . There was the Duke and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman whom I had seen at the pavilion and who had reminded me of use . I hardly saw the Duke , or the Princess . I felt as though I had stepped back into a mad fantastic dream . I stared ; for there , seated between the Duke and the Princess , was Maximilian.  |p240Frau  Graben was saying , " Are you all right , Miss Trant ? My goodness , you do look queer . Is it the heat ? " " I . . . I 'm all right , " I said . The sound of brass bands seemed a long way off ; the crowds below me seemed to sway ; I looked at the goosesteppingsoldiers without really seeing them . I could never mistake him . I knew him too well . In his uniform he looked more splendid than he had in the woods . But I would have known him in any costume . I sat there , aware of Frau Graben 's anxious glances which were somehow eager and excited . I was sure she knew that it was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds were sweeping forward ; the ducal party and its retinue had now gone into the church ; the service was in progress.  |p241Frau  Graben had brought her smelling salts from the capacious pocket of her skirts . " Have a sniff of these , my dear , " she said . " And , Fritz , run and tell the innkeeper to come to me . " I repeated : " I 'm all right . " But my voice sounded strange , shaky . " I think you felt a bit faint , dear . Would you like us to go back now or would you like to wait ? " Dagobert 's mouth was a round 0 of protest . Liesel began to wail : " I wo n't go home . " Fritz looked at me anxiously . " I want to stay , " I said . Indeed I wanted to stay . I wanted to see him again . I wanted to assure myself that I had been right . I kept saying to myself : " When you first saw the Count for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been mistaken again . But no . I had not been . It was true I would know him anywhere ; and the reason there was a resemblance between him and the Count was because they were cousins ; they had been brought up together and it was not only their looks which were similar . The innkeeper came and Frau Graben asked him for brandy . When it came she said : " Here , Miss Trant , sip this . It 'll do you the world of good . " " There 's nothing wrong , " I protested . " I do n't think you 're right , dear . " She was smiling , faintly complacent . She did n't seem to take her eyes from my face . " There , " she said , when I had taken some brandy . " That 's better . " I wanted to shout : It makes no difference . It 's not the heat . I 've seen Maximilian and Maximilian is your Prince of Rochenstein . The children were chattering . " I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked the soldiers . " " I liked the drums . " " Did you see Papa ? " " Papa was the best . He was the most handsome . "  |p242And  so on . I wished Frau Graben would not show such concern . " Perhaps we should have left , " she whispered . " No , no . It 'll be all right . " " It 's too late now . The crowd 's growing more dense . They 'll all be there till after the return procession back to the palace . " The service was over at last . They rode through the streets . Once more I saw him . At one moment I thought that , as he acknowledged the shouts of the crowd , he would look up at our window , but he did not . I felt dizzy and bewildered ; but there was a great singinggladness in my heart . I had found Maximilian . I was silent as P inzstein , one of the coachmen , drove us back to Klocksburg . When we arrived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , dear . That 's the best thing after a turn like that . " There was nothing I wanted to do so much as to be alone . My thoughts were in a whirl . I had to see him . I must let him know that I was here . Whatever had happened during those three days following the Night of the Seventh Moon I knew that it was the Prince whom I had met in the mist and that he was the father of my child . Little scraps of Frau Graben 's conversation came back to me . Her boys had been " ones " for the women , they had seen them and fancied them and let nothing stand in the way of their desires . She had impressed that upon me . I was suddenly reminded of the Princess Wilhelminathewoman who had a look of Ilse . His wife ! But how could she be if he were married to me ? Unless , of course , they had been married before . No , I remember something Frau Graben had said . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . a woman who came from a more important state than Rochenstein . So it was a good match . They had a child , who had followed in one of thep243carriages . I had not noticed him . I could see nothing , think of nothing but Maximilian . A great desolation came to me . It was nine years since we had met . What place could I have in his life now ? But I must see him . I might mean nothing to him , but I must see him . I had to know what had happened to me during those six days of my life . How did one see a prince ? One could not , I suppose , go to the Schloss or the palace and ask to see him . Perhaps one asked for an audience . My life was once more taking a dramatically fantastic turn . Fran Graben was knocking at the door . " Ah , lying down ! " she said . " That 's right . I 've brought you some of my special wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Stuff and nonsense . " She laughed as though something had secretly amused her . " This will do you good . I made it myself . It 's made with dandelions and a touch of the sloe , but I 'm not giving any more secrets away not even to you , dear Miss Trant . Poor Fritzi 's very anxious about you . My goodness , you 've wormed your way into that boy 's heart  --  no mistake . And he 's not one to give his affection easily either . You frightened me . " I sipped the wine . It made my throat tingle . " It 'll warm the cockles of your heart , as they say . There now , does n't it ? What did you think of our Prince ? " " Very handsome . . . " " Well , I 'd say Fredi was the more handsome of the two but young Maxi had a charm of his own . " " So you called him Maxi . " " Oh he 's Carl Ludwig Maximilian like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Carls when they come to power but they have their own family names . The boy 's called Carl in the Family and in public like his grandfather , It did me good to see Maxi . He looked well , I thought , after his stay in Berlin . I 'll warrant he enjoyed that . They say the Berlin girls are very smart . "  | " Did he go to see the girls ? " She laughed her loud abandoned laugh . " Well , he 'd always do that ; but it was this conference as well . He 'll have to show himself now round the countryside . I 'll bet he 'll be off on a tour of some sort soon . He 's been away some time . It was a good procession , was n't it ? Nothing like royalty to draw the crowds . And of course a young prince is always an attraction . Prince Charming , you know . The people like a young duke and they say his father 's not long for this world . He had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survived . Fredi 's a trial . He does n't want to see his cousin come into the title  --  the boy I brought up with him in the nursery . " " While she spoke she was watching me with her bright humorous but intent gaze . I wanted to say to her : Go away . I must be alone to think . She went to the window . " There 's his own flag flying from the tower . Blue on green with the eagle in the corner . That means he 's there . The Duke 's flag is there too . " I got up and went to the window and looked out . There were the two flags as Frau Graben had said . " Fredi flies his flag from his own Schloss and it 's very similar to Maxi 's . Fredi had the design altered slightly so that the difference between them is not all that easy to tell . Mischief ! " I stood at the window looking at the fluttering flags . " He 's come home in time for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent a sleepless night and the next morning was determined to see him soon . If I wrote would the letter reach him ? There were probably secretaries who screened his correspondence . Suppose I presented myself at the Schloss and said : " I must see the Prince . I am an old friend of his . " It would not be easy . There were guards at the entry to the Schloss . They would not let me through . I couldp245consult Frau Graben . If she were on such familiar terms with Maximilian as she was with the Count she would advise me ; but she would ferret my story from me and I did not wish to speak of it to anyone . I remembered how it had upset me when I had talked to Anthony . No one could have been more sympathetic , too much so perhaps . Frau Graben came to my room before breakfast to see how I was . Why did n't I take a day 's holiday ? she said . Get into the forest with the children . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Family accessible ? " She looked puzzled . " I mean do they meet people ? " " They 're meeting people all the time . " " I mean spontaneously . Do people call on them . . . " " Call on them ! Well , not exactly . They 'd have to wait until they were asked , would n't they ? " " I see . And I suppose there are secretaries and so on to protect them ? " " Well , would anyone be able to call on your Queen ? " I said I was sure that would have to be arranged too . She went to the window . " Oh , the Prince 's flag is no longer flying . That means he 's set off on his tour already . I sha n't see him now until he gets back . I 'll give him a good talking to . He knows I like to see him when he gets back from his stays away from us . " I felt a sense of frustration . I was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him ; that I must see him on a matter of great importance to me . But I felt it was wiser to say nothing . In any case I could take no action until he came back . Perhaps in the next few days some solution would occur to me . So I continued to fret and brood and yet sometimes I was so happy that my moods were unpredictable . I fluttered between despair and a wild unreasoning hope . The children were excited . Soon it would be the Night of the Seventh Moon . They had pointed the moon out to mep246when it was no more than a slim crescent lying there in the sky seeming to hang over the ducal Schloss . When it was full there would be the great night . There would be firework displays in the Schloss gardens and the whole town would be able to see them . Frau Graben had said that we should look from the turret room where we would get the best view . " The children would like to go into the town , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for you , Miss Trant , I 'd strongly advise you to stay in too . I would n't like to think of you out there . People seem to go quite mad on this night . You would n't understand . " " I think I do , " I said . " My goodness , ordinary decent Christians behave like barbarians . Something happens when the moon is full , they say . We go right back to the days before Jesus Christ walked this earth . Then there was a different religion here and this is Loke 's land . . . the land of mischief . I reckon it 's time this was abolished . The Duke tried to once , you know , but the people would n't have it . Whether the night was recognized or not they were still out in their masks and costumes . There 's many a girl meets her ruin on the Night of the Seventh Moon . " " I shall be content to watch from the turret room window , " I said . She nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're there . " All day long there was a mounting tension . On the previous afternoon the Prince had returned to the Schloss . Before I went to bed I saw his flag flying from the tower . I could not describe my feelings ; they fluctuated betweendespair and elation , between frustration and hope . One thought filled my mind : I must see him soon . In the afternoon the children , Frau Graben and I drove down into the town to see the preparations . Flags were hanging from the windows of the houses and I had neverp247seen the flower boxes at many of the windows so colorful . Some of the shops had boarded up their windows . The sun was hot ; people were laughing and joking ; they were all talking of " Tonight . " " I want to come down here tonight and see the dancing , " announced Dagobert . " You 're going to see the fireworks , " Frau Graben told him firmly . " I want to come too , " said Liesel , who followed Dagobert in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably , " the fireworks will be lovely . " " I 'll come out and put on a mask and ride down , " cried Dagobert . " I daresay , my lad , in your dreams , " laughed Frau Graben . " Now who 'd like to go to the Prince 's for spiced buns . " She gave me a gentle nudge . " That sounded funny did n't it . Go to the Prince 's for spiced buns . The inn , I mean , of course , not His Highness . " She went on chuckling at her joke and I made up my mind that the next day I would come down to the town when the children were with Pastor Kratz and ride up to the Schloss and tell the guards that they must let the Prince know that Helena Trant was asking to see him . At least if I did not see him then I might discover how I could do so . The children chattered over their buns and Frau Graben said we 'd better be getting back . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get caught in the crush . The evening came . I kept thinking of that long-ago day , of going forth into the town  --  another town , it was true , but that afternoon I had been struck by the similarity between the two  --  of losing Ilse and plunging straight into fantasy . The children were allowed to stay up a little later than usual to see the fireworks . " Providing , " said Frau Graben , " that as soon as they are over , there are no protests about going to bed . " So when it was dark we went to the turret room  --  **26;14027;TOOLONG to face Arren , " I am no lord now , nor you a prince . I am a trader called Hawk , and you 're my nephew , learning the seas with me , called Arren ; for we hail from Enlad . From what town ? A large one , lest we meet a townsman . " " Temere , on the south coast ? They trade to all the Reaches . " The Archmage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you do n't have quite the accent of Enlad . " " I know . I have a Gontish accent , " his companion said , and laughed , looking up at the brightening east . " But I think I can borrow what I need from you . So we come from Temerein our boat Dolphin , and I am neither lord nor mage nor Sparrowhawk , but  --  how am I called ? " " Hawk , my lord . " Then Arren bit his tongue . " Practice , nephew , " said the Archmage . " It takes practice . You 've never been anything but a prince . While I have been many things , and last of all , and maybe least , an Archmage . ... We go south looking for emmelstone , that blue stuff they carve charms of . I know they value it in Enlad . They make it into charms against rheums , sprains , stiff necks , and slips of the tongue . " After a moment Arren laughed , and as he lifted his head , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rim of the sun against the edge of the ocean , a flare of sudden gold , before them . Sparrowhawk stood with one hand on the mast , for the littleboat leapt on the choppy waves , and facing the sunrise of the equinox of spring he chanted . Arren did not know the Old Speech , the tongue of wizards and dragons , but he heard praise and rejoicing in the words , and there was a great strid/ing rhythm in them like the rise and fall of tides or the balance of the day and night each succeeding each forever . Gulls cried on the wind , and the shores of Thwil Bay slid past to right and left , and they entered on the long waves , full of light , of the Inmost Sea . From Roke to Hort Town is no great voyage , but they spent three nights at sea . The Archmage had been urgent to be gone , but once gone , he was more than patient . The winds turned contrary as soon as they were away from the charmed weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their sail , as any weatherworker could have done ; instead , he spent hours teaching Arren how to manage the boat in a stiff headwind , in the rock-fanged sea east of Issel . The second night out it rained , the rough , cold rain of March , but he said no spell to keep it off them . On the next night , as they lay outside the entrance to Hort Harbor in a calm , cold , foggy darkness , Arren thought about this , and reflected that in the short time he had known him , the Archmage had done no magic at all . He was a peerless sailor , though . Arren had learned more in three days ' sailing with him than in ten years of boating and racing on Berila Bay . And mage and sailor are not so far apart ; both work with the powers of sky and sea , and bend great winds to the uses of their hands , bringing near what was remote . Archmage or Hawk the sea-trader , it came to much the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-humored . No clumsiness of Arren 's fretted him ; he was companionable ; there could be no better shipmate , Arren thought . But he would go into his own thoughts and be silent for hours on end , and then when he spoke there was a harshness in his voice , and he would look right through Arren . This did notp40weaken the love the boy felt for him , but maybe it lessened liking somewhat ; it was a little awesome . Perhaps Sparrowhawkfelt this , for in that foggy night off the shores of Wathorthe began to talk to Arren , rather haltingly , about himself . " I do not want to go among men again tomorrow , " he said . " I 've been pretending that I am free . . . . That nothing 's wrong in the world . That I 'm not Archmage , not even sorcerer . That I 'm Hawk of Temere , without responsibilities or privileges , owing nothing to anyone .... " He stopped and after a while went on , " Try to choose carefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was young , I had to choose between the life of being and the life of doing . And I leapt at the latter like a trout to a fly . But each deed you do , each act , binds you to itself and to its consequences , and makes you act again and yet again . Then very seldom do you come upon a space , a time like this , between act and act , when you may stop and simply be . Or wonder who , after all , you are . " How could such a man , thought Arren , be in doubt as to who and what he was ? He had believed such doubts were reserved for the young , who had not done anything yet . The boat rocked in the great , cool darkness . " That 's why I like the sea , " said Sparrowhawk 's voice in that darkness . Arren understood him ; but his own thoughts ran ahead , as they had been doing all these three days and nights , to their quest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a mood to talk at last , he asked , " Do you think we will find what we seek in Hort Town ? " Sparrowhawk shook his head , perhaps meaning no , perhapsmeaning that he did not know . " Can it be a kind of pestilence , a plague , that drifts from land to land , blighting the crops and the flocks and men 's spirits ? "  | " A pestilence is a motion of the great Balance , of the Equilibriumitself ; this is different . There is the stink of evil in it . We may suffer for it when the balance of things rights itself , but we do not lose hope and forego art and forget the words of the Making . Nature is not unnatural . This is not a righting of the balance , but an upsetting of it . There is only one creaturewho can do that . " " A man ? " Arren said , tentative . " We men . " " How ? " " By an unmeasured desire for life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to live ? " " No . But when we crave power over life  --  endless wealth , unassailable safety , immortality  --  then desire becomes greed . And if knowledge allies itself to that greed , then comes evil . Then the balance of the world is swayed , and ruin weighs heavy in the scale . " Arren brooded over this a while and said at last , " Then you think it is a man we seek ? " " A man , and a mage . Aye , I think so . " " But I had thought , from what my father and teachers taught , that the great arts of wizardry were dependent on the Balance , the Equilibrium of things , and so could not be used for evil " " That , " said Sparrowhawk somewhat wryly , " is a debatable point . Infinite are the arguments of mages . . . . Every land of Earthsea knows of witches who cast unclean spells , sorcerers who use their art to win riches . But there is more . The Firelord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun at noon , w as a great mage ; even Erreth-Akbe could scarcely defeathim The Enemy of Morred was another such . Where he came , whole cities knelt to him ; armies fought for him . The spell he wove against Morred was so mighty that even whenp42he was slain it could not be halted , and the island of Solea was overwhelmed by the sea , and all on it perished . Those were men in whom great strength and knowledge served the will to evil and fed upon it . Whether the wizardry that serves a better end may always prove the stronger , we do not know . We hope . " There is a certain bleakness in finding hope where one expectedcertainty . Arren found himself unwilling to stay on these cold summits . He said after a little while , " I see why you say that only men do evil , I think . Even sharks are innocent ; they kill because they must . " " That is why nothing else can resist us . Only one thing in the world can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In our shame is our glory . Only our spirit , which is capable of evil , is capable of overcoming it . " " But the dragons , " said Arren . " Do they not do great evil ? Are they innocent ? " " The dragons ! The dragons are avaricious , insatiable , treacherous ; without pity , without remorse . But are they evil ? Who am I , to judge the acts of dragons ? . . . They are wiser than men are . It is with them as with dreams , Arren . We men dream dreams , we work magic , we do good , we do evil . The dragons do not dream . They are dreams . They do not work magic : it is their substance , their being . They do not do ; they are . " " In Serilune , " said Arren , " is the skin of Bar Oth , killed by Keor , Prince of Enlad , three hundred years ago . No dragons have ever come to Enlad since that day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy as iron and so large that if it were spread out it would cover all the marketplace of Serilune , they said . The teeth are as long as my forearm . Yet they said Bar Oth was a young dragon , not full-grown. "  | " There is a desire in you , " said Sparrowhawk , " to see dragons . " Yes . " " Their blood is cold and venomous . You must not look into their eyes . They are older than mankind .... " He was silent a while and then went on , " And though I came to forget or regret all I have ever done , yet would I remember that once I saw the dragons aloft on the wind at sunset above the western isles ; and I would be content . " Both were silent then , and there was no sound but the whisperingof the water with the boat , and no light . So at last , there on the deep waters , they slept . In the bright haze of morning they came into Hort Harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : fishermen'sboats , crabbers , trawlers , trading-ships , two galleys of twenty oars , one great sixty-oared galley in bad repair , and some lean , long sailing-ships with high triangular sails designed to catch the upper airs in the hot calms of the South Reach . " Is that a ship of war ? " Arren asked as they passed one of the twenty-oared galleys , and his companion answered , " A slaver , I judge from the chain-bolts in her hold . They sell men in the South Reach . " Arren pondered this a minute , then went to the gear-box and took from it his sword , which he had wrapped well and stowed away on the morning of their departure . He uncoveredit ; he stood indecisive , the sheathed sword on his two hands , the belt dangling from it . " It 's no sea-trader 's sword , " he said . " The scabbard is too fine . " Sparrowhawk , busy at the tiller , shot him a look . " Wear it if you like . "  | " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , that one is wise , " said his companion , his eyes alert on their passage through the crowded bay . " Is it not a sword reluctant to be used ? " Arren nodded . " So they say . Yet it has killed . It has killed men . " He looked down at the slender , hand-worn hilt . " It has , but I have not . It makes me feel a fool . It is too much older than I. . . . I shall take my knife , " he ended , and rewrapping the sword , shoved it down deep in the gear-box . His face was perplexed and angry . Sparrowhawk said nothing till he asked , " Will you take the oars now , lad ? We 're heading for the pier there by the stairs . " Hort Town , one of the Seven Great Ports of the Archipelago , rose from its noisy waterfront up the slopes of three steep hills in a jumble of color . The houses were of clay plastered in red , orange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; pendick-trees in flower made masses of dark red along the upper streets . Gaudy , striped awnings stretched from roof to roof , shading narrow marketplaces . The quays were bright with sunlight ; the streets running back from the waterfront were like dark slots full of shadows and people and noise . When they had tied up the boat , Sparrowhawk stooped over beside Arren as if to check the knot , and he said , " Arren , there are people in Wathort who know me pretty well ; so watch me , that you may know me . " When he straightened up there was no scar on his face . His hair was quite grey ; his nose was thick and somewhat snubbed ; and instead of a yewstaffhis own height , he carried a wand of ivory , which he tucked away inside his shirt . " Dost know me ? " he said to Arrenwith a broad smile , and he spoke with the accent of Enlad . " Hast never seen thy uncle before this ? " Arren had seen wizards at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Morred , and knew it was only illusion ; he kept his wits about him , and was able to say , " Oh aye , uncle Hawk ! " But , while the mage dickered with a harbor guardsman over the fee for docking and guarding the boat , Arren kept looking at him to make sure that he did know him . And as he looked , the transformation troubled him more , not less . It was too complete ; this was not the Archmage at all , this was no wise guide and leader . . . . The guardsman 's fee was high , and Sparrowhawk grumbled as he paid , and strode away with Arren , still grumbling . " A test of my patience , " he said . " Pay that swag-bellied thief to guard my boat ! When half a spell would do twice the job ! Well , this is the price of disguise . . . . And I 've forgot my proper speech , have I not , nevvy ? " They were walking up a crowded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than booths , whose owners stood in the doorways among heaps and festoons of wares , loudly proclaimingthe beauty and cheapness of their pots , hosiery , hats , spades , pins , purses , kettles , baskets , firehooks , knives , ropes , bolts , bed-linens , and every other kind of hardware and drygoods . " Is it a fair ? " " Eh ? " said the snub-nosed man , bending his grizzled head . " Is it a fair , uncle ? " " Fair ? No , no . They keep it up all year round , here . Keep your fishcakes , mistress , I have breakfasted ! " And Arren tried to shake off a man with a tray of little brass vases , who followedat his heels whining , " Buy , try , handsome young master , they wo n't fail you , breath as sweet as the roses of Numima , charming the women to you , try them , young sea-lord , young prince .... "  |p46All  at once Sparrowhawk was between Arren and the peddler , saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " the man whined , shrinking away from him . " I sell no charms , sea-master ! Only syrups to sweeten the breath after drink or hazia-root  --  only syrups , great prince ! " He cowered right down onto the pavement stones , his tray of vases clinking and clattering , some of them tipping so that a drop of the sticky stuff inside oozed out , pink or purple , over the lip . Sparrowhawk turned away without speaking and went on with Arren . Soon the crowds thinned and the shops grew wretchedly poor , little kennels displaying as all their wares a handful of bent nails , a broken pestle , and an old cardingcomb . This poverty disgusted Arren less than the rest ; in the rich end of the street he had felt choked , suffocated , by the pressure of things to be sold and voices screaming to him to buy , buy . And the peddler 's abjectness had shocked him . He thought of the cool , bright streets of his Northern town . No man in Berila , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These are a foul folk ! " he said . " This way , nevvy , " was all his companion 's answer . They turned aside into a passage between high , red , windowless house walls , which ran along the hillside and through an archwaygarlanded with decaying banners , out again into the sunlightin a steep square , another marketplace , crowded with booths and stalls and swarming with people and flies . Around the edges of the square , a number of men and women were sitting or lying on their backs , motionless . Their mouths had a curious blackish look , as if they had been bruised , and around their lips flies swarmed and gathered in clusters like bunches of dried currants . " So many , " said Sparrowhawk 's voice , low and hasty as ifp47he too had gotten a shock ; but when Arren looked at him there was the blunt , bland face of the hearty trader Hawk , showing no concern . " What 's wrong with those people ? " " Hazia . It soothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the mind roams free . But when it returns to the body it needs more hazia . . . . And the craving grows and the life is short , for the stuff is poison . First there is a trembling , and later paralysis , and then death . " Arren looked at a woman sitting with her back to a sunwarmedwall ; she had raised her hand as if to brush away the flies from her face , but the hand made a jerky , circular motion in the air , as if she had quite forgotten about it and it was moved only by the repeated surging of a palsy or shaking in the muscles . The gesture was like an incantation emptied of all intention , a spell without meaning . Hawk was looking at her too , expressionless . " Come on ! " he said . He led on across the marketplace to an awning-shaded booth . Stripes of sunlight colored green , orange , lemon , crimson , azure , fell across the cloths and shawls and woven belts displayed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feathered headdress of the woman who sold the stuff . She was big and she chanted in a big voice , " Silks , satins , canvases , furs , felts , woollens , fleecefells of Gont , gauzes of Sowl , silks of Lorbanery ! Hey , you Northern men , take off your duffle-coats ; do n't you see the sun 's out ? flow 's this to take home to a girl in far Havnor ? Look at it , silk of the South , fine as the mayfly 's wing ! " She had flipped Open with deft hands a bolt of gauzy silk , pink shot with threads of silver . " Nay , mistress , we 're not wed to queens , " said Hawk , andp48the woman 's voice rose to a blare : " So what do you dress your womenfolk burlap ? sailcloth ? Misers that wo n't buy a bit of silk for a poor woman freezing in the everlasting Northernsnow ! How 's this then , a Gontish fleecefell , to help you keep her warm on winter nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream and brown square , woven of the silky hair of the goats of the northeastern isles . The pretended trader put out his hand and felt it , and he smiled . " Aye , you 're a Gontishman ? " said the blaring voice , and the headdress nodding sent a thousand colored dots spinning over the canopy and the cloth . " This is Andradean work ; see ? There 's but four warpstrings to the finger 's width . Gont uses six or more . But tell me why you 've turned from working magic to selling fripperies . When I was here years since , I saw you pulling flames out of men 's ears , and then you made the flames turn into birds and golden bells , and that was a finer trade than this one . " " It was no trade at all , " the big woman said , and for a momentArren was aware of her eyes , hard and steady as agates , looking at him and Hawk from out of the glitter and restlessnessof her nodding feathers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire out of ears , " said Hawk in a dour but simple-minded tone . " I thought to show it to my nevvy . " " Well now , look you , " said the woman less harshly , leaningher broad , brown arms and heavy bosom on the counter . " We do n't do those tricks any more . People do n't want ' em . They 've seen through ' em . These mirrors now , I see you remembermy mirrors , " and she tossed her head so that the reflecteddots of colored light whirled dizzily about them . " Well , you can puzzle a man 's mind with the flashing of the mirrors and with words and with other tricks I wo n't tell you , till hep49thinks he sees what he do n't see , what is n't there . Like the flames and golden bells , or the suits of clothes I used to deck sailormen in , cloth of gold with diamonds like apricots , and off they 'd swagger like the King of All the Isles . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . They 're like chickens charmed by a snake , by a finger held before ' em . Men are like chickens . But then in the end they know they 've been fooled and fuddled and they get angry and lose their pleasure in such things . So I turned to this trade , and maybe all the silks are n't silks nor all the fleeces Gontish , but all the same they 'll wear  --  they 'll wear ! They 're real and not mere lies and air like the suits of cloth of gold . " " Well , well , " said Hawk , " then there 's none left in all Hort Town to pull fire out of ears , or do any magic like they did ? " At his last words the woman frowned ; she straightened up and began to fold the fleecefell carefully . " Those who want lies and visions chew hazia , " she said . " Talk to them if you like ! " She nodded at the unmoving figures around the square . " But there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put spells of fortune on their cargoes . Are they all turned to other trades ? " But she in sudden fury came blaring in over his words , " There 's a sorcerer if you want one , a great one , a wizard with a staff and all  --  see him there ? He sailed with Egre himself , making winds and finding fat galleys , so he said , but it was all lies , and Captain Egre gave him his just reward at last ; he cut his right hand off . And there he sits now , see him , with his mouth full of hazia and his belly full of air . Air and lies ! Air and lies ! That 's all there is to your magic , Seacapt , tinGoat ! " " Well , well , mistress , " said Hawk with obdurate mildness ,  | " I was only asking . " She turned her broad back with a great dazzle of whirling mirror-dots , and he ambled off , Arren beside him . His amble was purposeful . It brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propped against a wall , staring at nothing ; the dark , bearded face had been very handsome once . The wrinkled wrist-stump lay on the pavement stones in the hot , bright sunlight , shameful . There was some commotion among the booths behind them , but Arren found it hard to look away from the man ; a loathing fascination held him . " Was he really a wizard ? " he asked very low . " He may be the one called Hare , who was weatherworker for the pirate Egre . They were famous thieves  --  Here , stand clear , Arren ! " A man running full-tilt out from among the booths nearly slammed into them both . Another came trotting by , struggling under the weight of a great folding tray loaded with cords and braids and laces . A booth collapsed with a crash ; awnings were being pushed over or taken down hurriedly ; knots of people shoved and wrestled through the marketplace ; voices rose in shouts and screams . Above them all rang the blaring yell of the woman with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pole or stick against a bunch of men , fending them off with great sweeps like a swordsman at bay . Whether it was a quarrel that had spread and become a riot , or an attack by a gang of thieves , or a fight between two rival lots of peddlers , there was no telling . People rushed by with armfuls of goods that could be loot or their own property saved from looting . There were knife-fights , fist-fights , and brawls all over the square . " That way , " said Arren , pointing to a side street that led out of the square near them . He started for the street , for it was clearp51that they had better get out at once , but his companion caught his arm . Arren looked back and saw that the man Hare was struggling to his feet . When he got himself erect , he stood swaying a moment , and then without a look around him set off around the edge of the square , trailing his single hand along the house walls as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight , " Sparrowhawk said , and they set off following . No one molested them or the man they followed , and in a minute they were out of the market-square , going downhill in the silence of a narrow , twisting street . Overhead the attics of the houses almost met across the street , cutting out light ; underfoot the stones were slippery with water and refuse . Hare went along at a good pace , though he kept trailing his hand along the walls like a blind man . They had to keep pretty close behind him lest they lose him at a cross-street . The excitement of the chase came into Arren suddenly ; his senses were all alert , as they were during a stag-hunt in the forests of Enlad ; he saw vividly each face they passed , and breathed in the sweet stink of the city : a smell of garbage , incense , carrion , and flowers . As they threaded their way across a broad , crowded street he heard a drum beat and caught a glimpse of a line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wrist and waist , matted hair hanging over their faces : one glimpse and they were gone , as he dodged after Hare down a flight of steps and out into a narrow square , empty but for a few women gossiping at the fountain . There Sparrowhawk caught up with Hare and set a hand on his shoulder , at which Hare cringed as if scalded , wincing away , and backed into the shelter of a massive doorway . There he stood shivering and stared at them with the unseeing eyes of the hunted.  | " Are you called Hare ? " asked Sparrowhawk , and he spoke in his own voice , which was harsh in quality , but gentle in intonation . The man said nothing , seeming not to heed or not to hear . " I want something of you , " Sparrowhawk said . Again no response . " I 'll pay for it . " A slow reaction : " Ivory or gold ? " " Gold . " " How much ? " " The wizard knows the spell 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive for an instant , so quickly that it seemed to flicker , then clouding again into blankness . " That 's all gone , " he said , " all gone . " A coughing fit bent him over ; he spat black . When he straightenedup he stood passive , shivering , seeming to have forgotten what they were talking about . Again Arren watched him in fascination . The angle in which he stood was formed by two giant figures flanking a doorway , statues whose necks were bowed under the weight of a pediment and whose knot-muscled bodies emerged only partially from the wall , as if they had tried to struggle out of stone into life and had failed part way . The door they guarded was rotten on its hinges ; the house , once a palace , was derelict . The gloomy , bulging faces of the giants were chipped and lichen-grown . Between these ponderous figures the man called Hare stood slack and fragile , his eyes as dark as the windows of the empty house . He lifted up his maimed arm between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a poor cripple , master . . . . " The mage scowled as if in pain or shame ; Arren felt he had seen his true face for a moment under the disguise . He put his hand again on Hare 's shoulder and said a few words , softly , in the the wizardly tongue that Arren did not understand.  |p53But  Hare understood . He clutched at Sparrowhawk with his one hand and stammered , " You can still speak  --  speak  --  Come with me , come  --  " The mage glanced at Arren , then nodded . They went down by steep streets into one of the valleys betweenHort Town 's three hills . The ways became narrower , darker , quieter as they descended . The sky was a pale strip between the overhanging eaves , and the house walls to either hand were dank . At the bottom of the gorge a stream ran , stinking like an open sewer ; between arched bridges , houses crowded along the banks . Into the dark doorway of one of these houses Hare turned aside , vanishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unlit stairs creaked and swayed under their feet . At the head of the stairs Hare pushed open a door , and they could see where they were : an empty room with a straw-stuffed mattressin one corner and one unglazed , shuttered window that let in a little dusty light . Hare turned to face Sparrowhawk and caught at his arm again . His lips worked . He said at last , stammering , " Dragon ... dragon .... " Sparrowhawk returned his look steadily , saying nothing . " I can not speak , " Hare said , and he let go his hold on Sparrowhawk 's arm and crouched down on the empty floor , weeping . The mage knelt by him and spoke to'him softly in the Old Speech . Arren stood by the shut door , his hand on his knifehilt . The grey light and the dusty room , the two kneeling figures , the soft , strange sound of the mage 's voice speaking the language of the dragons , all came together as does a dream , having no relation to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . He dusted his knees with his singlehand and hid the maimed arm behind his back . He looked around him , looked at Arren ; he was seeing what he looked at now . He turned away presently and sat down on his mattress . Arren remained standing , on guard ; but , with the simplicityof one whose childhood had been totally without furnishings , Sparrowhawk sat down cross-legged on the bare floor . " Tell me how you lost your craft and the language of your craft , " he said . Hare did not answer for a while . He began to beat his mutilated arm against his thigh in a restless , jerky way , and at last he said , forcing the words out in bursts , " They cut off my hand . I ca n't weave the spells . They cut off my hand . The blood ran out , ran dry . " " But that was after you 'd lost your power , Hare , or else they could not have done it . " " Power .... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You called them by their names and they obeyed you . " " Yes . I remember being alive , " the man said in a soft , hoarse voice . " And I knew the words and the names .... " " Are you dead now ? " " No . Alive . Alive . Only once I was a dragon .... I 'm not dead . I sleep sometimes . Sleep comes very close to death , everyone knows that . The dead walk in dreams , everyone knows that . They come to you alive , and they say things . They walk out of death into the dreams . There 's a way . And if you go on far enough there 's a way back all the way . All the way . You can find it if you know where to look . And if you 're willingto pay the price . " " What price is that ? " Sparrowhawk 's voice floated on the dim air like the shadow of a falling leaf.  | " Life  --  what else ? What can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth on his pallet , a cunning , uncanny brightness in his eyes . " You see , " he said , " they can cut off my hand . They can cut off my head . It does n't matter . I can find the way back . I know where to look . Only men of power can go there . " " Wizards , you mean ? " " Yes . " Hare hesitated , seeming to attempt the word several times ; he could not say it . " Men of power , " he repeated . " And they must  --  and they must give it up . Pay . " Then he fell sullen , as if the word " pay " had at last roused associations , and he had realized that he was giving informationaway instead of selling it . Nothing more could be got from him , not even the hints and stammers about " a way back " which Sparrowhawk seemed to find meaningful , and soon enough the mage stood up . " Well , half-answers beat no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with payment , " and , deft as a conjuror , he flipped a gold piece onto the pallet in front of Hare . Hare picked it up . He looked at it and Sparrowhawk and Arren , with jerky movements of his head . " Wait , " he stammered . As soon as the situation changed he lost his grip of it and now groped miserably after what he wanted to say . " Tonight , " he said at last . " Wait . Tonight . I have hazia . " " I do n't need it . " " To show you  --  To show you the way . Tonight . I 'll take you . I 'll show you . You can get there , because you . . . you 're .... " He groped for the word until Sparrowhawk said , " I am a wizard . " " Yes ! So we can  --  we can get there . To the way . When I dream . In the dream . See ? I 'll take you . You 'll go with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p56S|parrowhawk  stood , solid and pondering , in the middle of the dim room . " Maybe , " he said at last . " If we come , we 'll be here by dark . " Then he turned to Arren , who opened the door at once , eager to be gone . The dank , overshadowed street seemed bright as a garden after Hare 's room . They struck out for the upper city by the shortest way , a steep stairway of stone between ivy-grown house walls . Arren breathed in and out like a sea lion  --  " Ugh !  --  Are you going back there ? " " Well , I will , if I ca n't get the same information from a less risky source . He 's likely to set an ambush for us . " " But are n't you defended against thieves and so on ? " " Defended ? " said Sparrowhawk . " What do you mean ? D' you think I go about wrapped up in spells like an old woman afraid of the rheumatism ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to hide our quest ; that 's all . We can look out for each other . But the fact is we 're not going to be able to keep out of danger on this journey . " " Of course not , " Arren said stiffly , angry , angered in his pride . " I did not seek to do so . " " That 's just as well , " the mage said , inflexible , and yet with a kind of good humor that appeased Arren 's temper . Indeed he was startled by his own anger ; he had never thought to speak thus to the Archmage . But then , this was and was not the Archmage , this Hawk with the snubbed nose and square , ill-shaven cheeks , whose voice was sometimes one man 's voice and sometimes another 's : a stranger , unreliable . " Does it make sense , what he told you ? " Arren asked , for he did not look forward to going back to that dim room above the stinking river . " All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head cut off ? " " I do n't know if it makes sense . I wanted to talk with ap57wizard who had lost his power . He says that he has n't lost it but given it  --  traded it . For what ? Life for life , he said . Power for power . No , I do n't understand him , but he is worth listening to . " Sparrowhawk 's steady reasonableness shamed Arren further . He felt himself petulant and nervous , like a child . Hare had fascinated him , but now that the fascination was broken he felt a sick disgust , as if he had eaten something vile . He resolved not to speak again until he had controlled his temper . Next moment he missed his step on the worn , slick stairs , slipped , recovered himself scraping his hands on the stones . " Oh curse this filthy town ! " he broke out in rage . And the mage replied dryly , " No need to , I think . " There was indeed something wrong about Hort Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might think seriously that it lay under a curse ; and yet this was not a presence of any quality , but rather an absence , a weakening of all qualities , like a sickness that soon infected the spirit of any visitor . Even the warmth of the afternoon sun was sickly , too heavy a heat for March . The squares and streets bustled with activity and business , but there was neither order nor prosperity . Goods were poor , prices high , and the markets were unsafe for vendors and buyers alike , being full of thieves and roaming gangs . Not many women were on the streets , and the few there were appearedmostly in groups . It was a city without law or governance . Talking with people , Arren and Sparrowhawk soon learned that there was in fact no council or mayor or lord left in Hort Town . Some of those who had used to rule the city had died , and some had resigned , and some had been assassinated ; various chiefs lorded it over various quarters of the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so on.  |p58There  was no center left to the city . The people , for all their restless activity , seemed purposeless . Craftsmen seemed to lack the will to work well ; even the robbers robbed because it was all they knew how to do . All the brawl and brightness of a great port-city was there , on the surface , but all about the edges of it sat the hazia-eaters , motionless . And underthe surface , things did not seem entirely real , not even the faces , the sounds , the smells . They would fade from time to time during that long , warm afternoon while Sparrowhawk and Arren walked the streets and talked with this person and that . They would fade quite away . The striped awnings , the dirty cobbles , the colored walls , and all the vividness of being would be gone , leaving the city a dream city , empty and dreary in the hazy sunlight . Only at the top of the town where they went to rest a while in late afternoon did this sickly mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a town for luck , " Sparrowhawk had said some hours ago , and now after hours of aimless wandering and fruitless conversations with strangers , he looked tired and grim . His disguise was wearing a little thin ; a certain hardnessand darkness could be seen through the bluff sea-trader 's face . Arren had not been able to shake off the morning 's irritability . They sat down on the coarse turf of the hilltop under the leaves of a grove of pendick trees , dark-leaved and budded thickly with red buds , some open . From there they saw nothing of the city but its tile roofs multitudinously scaling downward to the sea . The bay opened its arms wide , slate blue beneath the spring haze , reaching on to the edge of air . No lines were drawn , no boundaries . They sat gazing at that immense blue space . Arren 's mind cleared , opening out to meet and celebrate the world . When they went to drink from a little stream nearby , run/ping clear over brown rocks from its spring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank deep and doused his head right under the cold water . Then he got up and declaimedthe lines from the Deed of Morred , Praised are the Fountains of Shelieth , the silver harp of the waters , But blest in my name forever this stream that stanched my thirst ! Sparrowhawk laughed at him , and he also laughed . He shook his head like a dog , and the bright spray flew out fine in the last gold sunlight . They had to leave the grove and go down into the streets again , and when they had made their supper at a stall that sold greasy fishcakes , night was getting heavy in the air . Darkness came fast in the narrow streets . " We 'd better go , lad , " said Sparrowhawk , and Arren said , " To the boat ? " but knew it was not to the boat but to the house above the river and the empty , dusty , terrible room . Hare was waiting for them in the doorway . He lighted an oil lamp to show them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he held it , throwing vast , quick shadows up the walls . He had got another sack of straw for his visitors to sit on , but Arren took his place on the bare floor by the door . The door opened outward , and to guard it he should have sat himself down outside it : but that pitch-black hall was more than he could stand , and he wanted to keep an eye on Hare . Sparrowhawk 's attention and perhaps his powers were going to be turned on what Hare had to tell him or show him ; it was up to Arren to keep alert for trickery.  |p60Hare  held himself straighter and trembled less ; he had cleaned his mouth and teeth ; he spoke sanely enough at first , though with excitement . His eyes in the lamplight were so dark that they seemed , like the eyes of animals , to show no whites . He disputed earnestly with Sparrowhawk , urging him to eat hazia . " I want to take you , take you with me . We 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , whether you 're ready or not . You must have the hazia to follow me . " " I think I can follow you . " " Not where I 'm going . This is n't . . . spell-casting . " He seemed unable to say the words " wizard " or " wizardry . " " I know you can get to the  --  the place , you know , the wall . But it is n't there . It 's a different way . " " If you go , I can follow . " Hare shook his head . His handsome , ruined face was flushed ; he glanced over at Arren often , including him , though he spoke only to Sparrowhawk . " Look : there are two kinds of men , are n't there ? Our kind and the rest . The . . . the dragons and the others . People without power are only halfalive . They do n't count . They do n't know what they dream ; they 're afraid of the dark . But the others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the dark . We have strength . " " So long as we know the names of things . " " But names do n't matter there  --  that 's the point , that 's the point ! It is n't what you do , what you know , that you need . Spells are no good . You have to forget all that , to let it go . That 's where eating hazia helps ; you forget the names , you let the forms of things go , you go straight to the reality . I 'm goingto be going pretty soon now ; if you want to find out where , you ought to do as I say . I say as he does . You must be a lord of men to be a lord of life . You have to find the secret . I could tell you its name but what 's a name ? A name isn'tp61real , the real , the real forever . Dragons ca n't go there . Dragonsdie . They all die . I took so much tonight you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where I get lost you can lead me . Remember what the secret is ? Remember ? No death . No death  --  no ! No sweaty bed and rotting coffin , no more , never . The blood dries up like the dry river and it 's gone . No fear . No death . The names are gone and the words and the fear , gone . Show me where I get lost , show me , lord .... " So he went on , in a choked rapture of words that was like the chanting of a spell , and yet made no spell , no whole , no sense . Arren listened , listened , striving to understand . If only he could understand ! Sparrowhawk should do as he said and take the drug , this once , so that he could find out what Hare was talking about , the mystery that he would not or could not speak . Why else were they here ? But then ( Arren looked from Hare 's ecstatic face to the other profile ) perhaps the mage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that profile . Where was the snubbed nose , the bland look ? Hawk the seatraderwas gone , forgotten . It was the mage , the Archmage , who sat there . Hare 's voice now was a crooning mumble , and he rocked his body as he sat cross-legged . His face had grown haggard and his mouth slack . Facing him , in the tiny , steady light of the oil lamp set on the floor between them , the other never spoke , but he had reached out and taken Hare 's hand , holding him . Arren had not seen him reach out . There were gaps in the order of events , gaps of nonexistence  --  drowsiness , it must be . Surely some hours had passed ; it might be near midnight . He slept , would he too be able to follow Hare into his dream and come to the place , the secret way ? Perhaps he could . It seemed quite possible now . But he was to guard the door . He and Sparrowhawk had scarcely spoken of it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hare might have planned some ambush ; he had been a pirate ; he knew robbers . They had said nothing , but Arren knew that he was to stand guard , for while the mage made this strange journey of the spirit he would be defenseless . But like a fool he had left his sword on board the boat , and how much good would his knife be if that door swung suddenly open behind him ? But that would not happen : he could listen and hear . Hare was not speaking any more . Both men were utterly silent ; the whole house was silent . Nobody could come up those swaying stairs without some noise . He could speak , if he heard a noise : shout aloud , and the trance would break , and Sparrowhawk would turn and defend himself and Arren with all the vengefullightning of a wizard 's rage . . . . When Arren had sat down at the door , Sparrowhawk had looked at him , only a glance , approval : approval and trust . He was the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was hard , hard to keep watching those two faces , the little pearl of the lampflamebetween them on the floor , both silent now , both still , their eyes open but not seeing the light or the dusty room , not seeing the world , but some other world of dream or death . . . to watch them and not to try to follow them . . . . There , in the vast , dry darkness , there one stood beckoning . Come , he said , the tall lord of shadows . In his hand he held a tiny flame no larger than a pearl , held it out to Arren , offering life . Slowly Arren took one step toward him , following.  |p63Ivry  , his mouth was dry . There was the taste of dust in his mouth . His lips were covered with dust . Without lifting his head from the floor , he watched the shadow-play . There were the big shadows that moved and stooped , swelled and shrank , and fainter ones that ran around the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowin the corner and a shadow on the floor , and neither of these moved.  |p64The  back of his head began to hurt . At the same time , what he saw came clear to his mind , in one flash , frozen in an instant : Hare slumped in a corner with his head on his knees , Sparrowhawk sprawled on his back , a man kneeling over Sparrowhawk , another tossing gold pieces into a bag , a third standing watching . The third man held a lantern in one hand and a dagger in the other , Arren 's dagger . If they talked , he did not hear them . He heard only his own thoughts , which told him immediately and unhesitatingly what to do . He obeyed them at once . He crawled forward very slowly a couple of feet , darted out his left hand and grabbedthe bag of loot , leapt to his feet , and made for the stairs with a hoarse yell . He plunged downstairs in the blind dark without missing a step , without even feeling them under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out onto the street and ran full-speed into the dark . The houses were black hulks against the stars . Starlight gleamed faintly on the river to his right , and though he could not see where the streets led , he could make out street-crossingsand so turn and double on his track . They had followed him ; he could hear them behind him , not very far behind . They were unshod , and their panting breathing was louder than their footfalls . He would have laughed if he had had time ; he knew at last what it was like to be the hunted instead of the hunter , the quarry instead of the leader of the chase . It was to be alone and to be free . He swerved to the right and dodged stooping across a high-parapetted bridge , slipped into a side street , around a corner , back to the riverside and along it for a way , across another bridge . His shoes were loud on the cobblestones , the only sound in all the city ; he paused at the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the hunt had not lost him . The lantern glittered a secondp65across the river ; the soft , heavy , running feet came on . He could not get away from them . He could only outrun them ; keep going , keep ahead , and get them away from the dusty room , far away ... . They had stripped his coat off him , along with his dagger , and he was in shirt-sleeves , light and hot , his head swimming , and the pain in the back of his skull pointing and pointing with each stride , and he ran and he ran .. : . The bag hinderedhim . He flung it down suddenly , a loose gold piece flyingout and striking the stones with a clear ring . " Here 's your money ! " he yelled , his voice hoarse and gasping . He ran on . And all at once the street ended . No cross-streets , no stars before him , a dead end . Without pausing he turned back and ran at his pursuers . The lantern swung wild in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . There was a lantern swinging back and forth before him , a faint spot of light in a great , moving grayness . He watched it for a long time . It grew fainter , and at last a shadow passed before it , and when the shadow went on the light was gone . He grieved for it a little ; or perhaps he was grieving for himself , because he knew he must wake up now . The lantern , dead , still swung against the mast to which it was fixed . All around , the sea brightened with the coming sun . A drum beat . Oars creaked heavily , regularly ; the wood of the ship cried and creaked in a hundred little voices ; a man up in the prow called something to the sailors behind him . The men chained with Arren in the after hold were all silent . Each wore an iron band around his waist and manacles on his wrists , and both these bonds were linked by a short , heavy chain to the bonds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a bolt in the deck , so that the man could sit orp66crouch , but could not stand . They were too close together to lie down , jammed together in the small cargo-hold . Arren was in the forward port corner . If he lifted his head high , his eyes were on a level with the deck between hold and rail , a couple of feet wide . He did not remember much of last night past the chase and the dead-end street . He had fought and been knocked down and trussed up and carried somewhere . A man with a strange , whispering voice had spoken ; there had been a place like a smithy , a forge-fire leaping red . . . . He could not recall it . He knew , though , that this was a slave-ship , and that he had been taken to be sold . It did not mean much to him . He was too thirsty . His body ached and his head hurt . When the sun rose the light sent lances of pain into his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each and a long drink from a leather flask , held to their lips by a man with a sharp , hard face . His neck was clasped by a broad , gold-studded leather band like a dog 's collar , and when Arren heard him speak he recognized the weak , strange , whistling voice . Drink and food eased his bodily wretchedness for a while and cleared his head . He looked for the first time at the faces of his fellow slaves , three in his row and four close behind . Some sat with their heads on their raised knees ; one was slumped over , sick or drugged . The one next to Arren was a fellow of twenty or so with a broad , flat face . " Where are they taking us ? " Arren said to him . The fellow looked at him  --  their faces were not a foot apart  --  and grinned , shrugging , and Arren thought he meant he did not know ; but then he jerked his manacled arms as if to gesture and opened his still-grinning mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a black root . " It 'll be Showl , " said one behind Arren ; and another , " Or the Market at Amrun , " and then the man with the collar , who seemed to be everywhere on the ship , was bending above the hold , hissing , " Be still if you do n't want to be shark bait , " and all of them were still . Arren tried to imagine these places , Showl , the Market of Amrun . They sold slaves there . They stood them out in front of the buyers , no doubt , like oxen or rams for sale in Berila Marketplace . He would stand there wearing chains . Somebodywould buy him and lead him home and they would give him an order ; and he would refuse to obey . Or obey and try to escape . And he would be killed , one way or the other . It was not that his soul rebelled at the thought of slavery ; he was much too sick and bewildered for that . It was simply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week or two he would die or be killed . Though he saw and accepted this as a fact , it frightened him , so that he stopped trying to think ahead . He stared down at the foul , black planking of the hold between his feet and felt the heat of the sun on his naked shoulders and felt the thirst drying out his mouth and narrowing his throat again . The sun sank . Night came on clear and cold . The sharp stars came out . The drum beat like a slow heart , keeping the oar-stroke , for there was no breath of wind . Now the cold became the greatest misery . Arren 's back gained a little warmth from the cramped legs of the man behind him and his left side from the mute beside him , who sat hunched up , humming a grunting rhythm all on one note . The rowers changed shift ; the drum beat again . Arren had longed for the darkness , but he could not sleep . His bones ached , and he mild not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p68staring  up at the stars , which jerked across the sky with every stroke the oarsmen took , slid to their places , and were still , jerked again , slid , paused ... . The man with the collar and another man stood between the after hold and the mast ; the little swinging lantern on the mast sent gleams between them and silhouetted their heads and shoulders . " Fog , you pig 's bladder , " said the weak , hateful voice of the man with the collar , " what 's a fog doing in the Southing Straits this time of year ? Curse the luck ! " The drum beat . The stars jerked , slid , paused . Beside Arren the tongueless man shuddered all at once and , raising his head , let out a nightmare scream , a terrible , formless noise . " Quiet there ! " roared the second man by the mast . The mute shudderedagain and was silent , munching with his jaws . Stealthily the stars slid forward into nothingness . The mast wavered and vanished . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The drum faltered and then resumed its beat , but slower . " Thick as curdled milk , " said the hoarse voice somewhere above Arren . " Keep up the stroke there ! There 's no shoals for twenty miles ! " A horny , scarred foot appeared out of the fog , paused an instant close to Arren 's face , then with one step vanished . In the fog there was no sense of forward motion , only of swaying and the tug of the oars . The throb of the stroke-drum was muffled . It was clammy cold . The mist condensing in Arren'shair ran down into his eyes ; he tried to catch the drops with his tongue and breathed the damp air with open mouth , trying to assuage his thirst . But his teeth chattered . The cold metal of a chain swung against his thigh and burnt like fire where it touched . The drum beat , and beat , and ceased . It was silent.  | " Keep the beat ! What 's amiss ? " roared the hoarse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship rolled a little on the quiet sea . Beyond the dim rails was nothing : blank . Something grated against the ship 's side . The noise was loud in that dead , weird silence and darkness . " We 're aground , " one of the prisoners whispered , but the silence closed in on his voice . The fog grew bright , as if a light were blooming in it . Arrensaw the heads of the men chained by him clearly , the tiny moisture-drops shining in their hair . Again the ship swayed , and he strained as far up as his chains would let him , stretching his neck , to see forward in the ship . The fog glowed over the deck like the moon behind thin clouds , cold and radiant . The oarsmen sat like carved statues . Crewmen stood in the waist of the ship , their eyes shining a little . Alone on the port side stood a man , and it was from him that the light came , from the face and hands and staff that burned like molten silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape was crouched . Arren tried to speak and could not . Clothed in that majesty of light , the Archmage came to him and knelt down on the deck . Arren felt the touch of his hand and heard his voice . He felt the bonds on his wrists and body give way ; all through the hold there was a rattling of chains . But no man moved ; only Arren tried to stand , but he could not , being cramped with long immobility . The Archmage 's strong grip was on his arm , and with that help he crawled up out of the cargo-hold and huddled on the deck . The Archmage strode away from him , and the misty splendorglowed on the unmoving faces of the oarsmen . He halted by the man who had crouched down by the port rail . " I do not punish , " said the hard , clear voice , cold as the coldp70magelight in the fog . " But in the cause of justice , Egre , I take this much upon myself : I bid your voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking . " He came back to Arren and helped him to get to his feet . " Come on now , lad , " he said , and with his help Arren managed to hobble forward , and half-scramble , half-fall down into the boat that rocked there below the ship 's side : Look far , her sail like a moth 's wing in the fog . In the same silence and dead calm the light died away , and the boat turned and slipped from the ship 's side . Almost at once the galley , the dim mast-lantern , the immobile oarsmen , the hulking black side , were gone . Arren thought he heard voices break out in cries , but the sound was thin and soon lost . A little longer , and the fog began to thin and tatter , blowing by in the dark . They came out under the stars , and silent as a moth Look f ar fled through the clear night over the sea . Sparrowhawk had covered Arren with blankets and givenhim water ; he sat with his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping . Sparrowhawk said nothing , but there was a gentleness , a steadiness , in the touch of his hand . Comfort came slowly into Arren : warmth , the soft motion of the boat , heart 's ease . He looked up at his companion . No unearthly radiance clung to the dark face . He could barely see him against the stars . The boat fled on , charm-guided . Waves whispered as if in surprise along her sides . " Who is the man with the collar ? " " Lie still . A sea-robber , Egre . He wears that collar to hide a scar where his throat was slit once . It seems his trade has sunk from piracy to slaving . But he took the bear 's cub this time . " There was a slight ring of satisfaction in the dry , quiet voice.  | " How did you find me ? " " Wizardry , bribery . . . . I wasted time . I did not like to let it be known that the Archmage and Warden of Roke was ferreting about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept up my disguise . But I had to track down this man and that man , and when at last I found that the slaver had sailed before daybreak , I lost my temper . I took Look far and spoke the wind into her sail in the dead calm of the day and glued the oars of every ship in that bay fast into the oarlocks  --  for a while . How they 'll explain that , if wizardry 's all lies and air , is their problem . But in my haste and anger I missed and overpassed Egre 's ship , which had gone east of south to miss the shoals . Ill done was all I did this day . There is no luck in Hort Town . . . . Well , I made a spell of finding at last , and so came on the ship in the darkness . Should you not sleep now ? " " I 'm all right . I feel much better . " A light fever had replacedArren 's chill , and he did indeed feel well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to another . " How soon did you wake up ? What happened to Hare ? " " I woke with daylight ; and lucky I have a hard head ; there 's a lump and a cut like a split cucumber behind my ear . I left Hare in the drug-sleep . " " I failed my guard  --  " " But not by falling asleep . " " No . " Arren hesitated . " It was  --  I was  --  " " You were ahead of me ; I saw you , " Sparrowhawk said strangely . " And so they crept in and tapped us on the head like lambs at the shambles , took gold , good clothes , and the salable slave , and left . It was you they were after , lad . You 'd fetch the price of a farm in Amrun Market . " " They did n't tap me hard enough . I woke up . I did give them a run . I spilt their loot all over the street , too , beforep72they cornered me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there  --  and ran ? Why ? " " To get them away from you . " The surprise in Sparrowhawk'svoice suddenly struck Arren 's pride , and he added fiercely , " I thought it was you they were after . I thought they might kill you . I grabbed their bag so they 'd follow me , and shouted out and ran . And they did follow me . " " Aye  --  they would ! " That was all Sparrowhawk said , no word of praise , though he sat and thought a while . Then he said , " Did it not occur to you I might be dead already ? " " No . " " Murder first and rob after , is the safer course . " " I did n't think of that . I only thought of getting them away from you . " " Why ? " " Because you might be able to defend us , to get us both out of it , if you had time to wake up . Or get yourself out of it , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard . I tried to make up for it . You are the one I was guarding . You are the one that matters . I 'm along to guard , or whatever you need  --  it 's you who 'll lead us , who can get to wherever it is we must go , and put right what 's gone wrong . " " Is it ? " said the mage . " I thought so myself , until last night . I thought I had a follower , but I followed you , my lad . " His voice was cool and perhaps a little ironic . Arren did not know what to say . He was indeed completely confused . He had thought that his fault of falling into sleep or trance on guard could scarcely be atoned by his feat of drawing off the robbers from Sparrowhawk : it now appeared that the latter had been a silly act , whereas going into trance at the wrong moment had been wonderfully clever . " I am sorry , my lord , " he said at last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled again , " that I failed you . And you have saved my life  --  " " And you mine , maybe , " said the mage harshly . " Who knows ? They might have slit my throat when they were done . No more of that , Arren . I am glad you are with me . " He went to their stores-box then and lit their little charcoal stove and busied himself with something . Arren lay and watched the stars , and his emotions cooled and his mind ceased racing . And he saw then that what he had done and what he had not done were not going to receive judgment from Sparrowhawk . He had done it ; Sparrowhawk accepted it as done . " I do not punish , " he had said , cold-voiced , to Egre . Neither did he reward . But he had come for Arren in all haste across the sea , unleashing the power of his wizardry for his sake ; and he would do so again . He was to be depended on . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the trust . For the fact was that he trusted Arren . What Arren did , was right . He came back now , handing Arren a cup of steaming hot wine . " Maybe that 'll put you to sleep . Take care , it 'll scald your tongue . " " Where did the wine come from ? I never saw a wineskin aboard  --  " " There 's more in Look f ar than meets the eye , " Sparrowhawksaid , sitting down again beside him , and Arren heard him laugh , briefly and almost silently , in the dark . Arren sat up to drink the wine . It was very good , refreshing body and spirit . He said , " Where are we going now ? " " Westward . " " Where did you go with Hare ? " " Into the darkness . I never lost him , but he was lost . He wandered on the outer borders , in the endless barrens of deli/rium and nightmare . His soul piped like a bird in those dreary places , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no guide . He has always been lost . For all his craft in sorcery he has never seen the way before him , seeing only himself . " Arren did not understand all of this ; nor did he want to understand it , now . He had been drawn a little way into that " darkness " of which wizards spoke , and he did not want to remember it ; it was nothing to do with him . Indeed he did not want to sleep , lest he see it again in dream and see that dark figure , a shadow holding out a pearl , whispering , " Come . " " My lord , " he said , his mind veering away rapidly to anothersubject , " why  --  " " Sleep ! " said Sparrowhawk with mild exasperation . " I ca n't sleep , my lord . I wondered why you did n't free the other slaves . " " I did . I left none bound on that ship . " " But Egre 's men had weapons . If you had bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? There were but six . The oarsmenwere chained slaves , like you . Egre and his men may be dead by now , or chained by the others to be sold as slaves ; but I left them free to fight or bargain . I am no slave-taker . " " But you knew them to be evil men  --  " " Was I to join them therefore ? To let their acts rule my own ? I will not make their choices for them , nor will I let them make mine for me ! " Arren was silent , pondering this . Presently the mage said , speaking softly , " Do you see , Arren , how an act is not , as young men think , like a rock that one picks up and throws , and it hits or misses , and that 's the end of it . When that rock is lifted , the earth is lighter ; the hand that bears it heavier . When it is thrown , the circuits of the stars respond , and where it strikes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bal/ante of the whole depends . The winds and seas , the powers of water and earth and light , all that these do , and all that the beasts and green things do , is well done , and rightly done . All these act within the Equilibrium . From the hurricane and the great whale 's sounding to the fall of a dry leaf and the gnat 's flight , all they do is done within the balance of the whole . But we , insofar as we have power over the world and over one another , we must learn to do what the leaf and the whale and the wind do of their own nature . We must learn to keep the balance . Having intelligence , we must not act in ignorance . Having choice , we must not act without responsibility . Who am I  --  though I have the power to do it  --  to punish and reward , playing with men 's destinies ? " " But then , " the boy said , frowning at the stars , " is the balanceto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , even not knowing all the consequences of his act , if anything is to be done at all ? " " Never fear . It is much easier for men to act than to refrainfrom acting . We will continue to do good and to do evil . ... But if there were a king over us all again and he sought counsel of a mage , as in the days of old , and I were that mage , I would say to him : My lord , do nothing because it is righteous or praiseworthy or noble to do so ; do nothing becauseit seems good to do so ; do only that which you must do and which you can not do in any other way . " There was that in his voice which made Arren turn to watch him as he spoke . He thought that the radiance of light was shining again from his face , seeing the hawk nose and the scarred cheek , the dark , fierce eyes . And Arren looked at him with love , but also with fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yet as he gazed he became aware at last that it was no rnagelight , no cold glory of wizardry , that lay shadowless onp76every line and plane of the man 's face , but light itself : morning , the common light of day . There was a power greater than the mage 's . And the years had been no kinder to Sparrowhawk than to any man . Those were lines of age , and he looked tired , as the light grew ever stronger . He yawned . . . . So gazing and wondering and pondering , Arren fell asleep at last . But Sparrowhawk sat by him watching the dawn come and the sun rise , even as one might study a treasure for somethinggone amiss in it , a jewel flawed , a child sick.  |p77late  in the morning Sparrowhawk took the magewind from the sail and let his boat go by the world 's wind , which blew softly to the south and west . Far off to the right , the hills of southern Wathort slipped away and fell behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves . Arren woke . The sea basked in the hot , gold noon , endlesswater under endless light . In the stern of the boat Sparrowhawksat naked except for a loincloth and a kind of tur/ban made from sailcloth . He was singing softly , striking his palms on the thwart as if it were a drum , in a light , monotonousrhythm . The song he sang was no spell of wizardry , no chant or Deed of heroes or kings , but a lilting drone of nonsensewords , such as a boy might sing as he herded goats through the long , long afternoons of summer , in the high hills of Gont , alone . From the sea 's surface a fish leapt up and glided through the air for many yards on stiff , shimmering vanes like the wings of dragonflies . " We 're in the South Reach , " Sparrowhawk said when his song was done . " A strange part of the world , where the fish fly and the dolphins sing , they say . But the water 's mild for swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wash the touch of the slave-taker from you . " Arren was sore in every muscle and loath to move at first . Also he was an unpracticed swimmer , for the seas of Enlad are bitter , so that one must fight with them rather than swim in them and is soon exhausted . This bluer sea was cold at first plunge , then delightful . Aches dropped away from him . He thrashed by Lookfar 's side like a young sea-serpent . Spray flew up in fountains . Sparrowhawk joined him , swimming with a firmer stroke . Docile and protective , Look f ar waited for them , white-winged on the shining water . A fish leapt from sea to air ; Arren pursued it ; it dived , leapt up again , swimming in air , flying in the sea , pursuing him . Golden and supple , the boy played and basked in the water and the light until the sun touched the sea . And dark and spare , with the economy of gesture and the terse strength of age , the man swam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awning of sailcloth , and watched the swimming boy and the flying fish with an impartial tenderness.  | " Where are we heading ? " Arren asked in the late dusk , after eating largely of salt meat and hard bread , and already sleepy again . " Lorbanery , " Sparrowhawk replied , and the soft syllables formed the last word Arren heard that night , so that his dreams of the early night wove themselves about it . He dreamt he was walking in drifts of soft , pale-colored stuff , shreds and threads of pink and gold and azure , and felt a foolish pleasure ; someone told him , " These are the silk-fields of Lorbanery , where it never gets dark . " But later , in the fagendof night , when the stars of autumn shone in the sky of spring , he dreamt that he was in a ruined house . It was dry there . Everything was dusty , and festooned with ragged , dusty webs . Arren 's legs were tangled in the webs , and they drifted across his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror of it was that he knew the high , ruined room was that hall where he had breakfasted with the Masters , in the Great House on Roke . He woke all in dismay , his heart pounding , his legs cramped against a thwart . He sat up , trying to get away from the evil dream . In the east there was not yet light , but a dilutionof darkness . The mast creaked ; the sail , still taut to the northeast breeze , glimmered high and faint above him . In the stern his companion slept sound and silent . Arren lay down again and dozed till clear day woke him . This day the sea was bluer and quieter than he had ever imagined it could be , the water so mild and clear that swimming in it was half like gliding or floating upon air ; strange it was and dreamlike . In the noontime he asked , " Do wizards make much account of dreams ? " Sparrowhawk was fishing . He watched his line attentively.  |p80After  a long time he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth in them . " " Surely . " " Do they foretell truly ? " But the mage had a bite , and ten minutes later , when he had landed their lunch , a splendid silver-blue sea bass , the question was clean forgotten . In the afternoon as they lazed under the awning rigged to give shelter from the imperious sun , Arren asked , " What do we seek in Lorbanery ? " " That which we seek , " said Sparrowhawk . " In Enlad , " said Arren after a while , " we have a story about the boy whose schoolmaster was a stone . " " Aye ? . . . What did he learn ? " " Not to ask questions . " Sparrowhawk snorted , as if suppressing a laugh , and sat up . " Very well ! " he said . " Though I prefer to save talking till I know what I 'm talking about . Why is there no more magic done in Hort Town and in Narveduen and maybe throughout all the Reaches ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . " " Do you know the old saying , Rules change in the Reaches ? Seamen use it , but it is a wizards ' saying , and it means that wizardry itself depends on place . A true spell on Roke may be mere words on Ifish . The language of the Making is not everywhere remembered ; here one word , there another . And the weaving of spells is itself interwoven with the earth and the water , the winds and the fall of light of the place where it is cast . I once sailed far into the East , so far that neither wind nor water heeded my command , being ignorant of their true names ; or more likely it was I who was ignorant . " The world is very large , the Open Sea going on past allp81knowledge ; and there are worlds beyond the world . Over these abysses of space and in the long extent of time , I doubt whether any word that can be spoken would bear , everywhere and forever , its weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word which Segoy spoke , making all , or the Final Word , which has not been nor will be spoken until all things are unmade . . . . So , even within this world of our Earthsea , the little islands that we know , there are differences and mysteries and changes . And the place least known and fullest of mysteries is the South Reach . Few wizards of the Inner Lands have come among these people . They do not welcomewizards , having  --  so it is believed  --  their own kinds of magic . But the rumors of these are vague , and it may be that the art magic was never well known there , nor fully understood . If so , it would be easily undone by one who set himself to the undoing of it , and sooner weakened than our wizardry of the Inner Lands . And then we might hear tales of the failureof magic in the South . For discipline is the channel in which our acts run strong and deep ; where there is no direction , the deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that fat woman of the mirrors has lost her art and thinks she never had it . And so flare takes his hazia and thinks he has gone farther than the greatest mages go , when he has barely entered the fields of dream and is already lost .... But where is it that he thinks he goes ? What is it he looks for ? What is it that has swallowed up his wizardry ? We have had enough of Hort Town , I think , so we go farther south , to Lorbanery , to see what the wizards do there , to find out what it is that we must find out . . Does that answer you ? " " Yes , but  --  " ' Then let the stone be still a while ! " said the mage . Andp82he sat by the mast in the yellowish , glowing shade of the awningand looked out to sea , to the west , as the boat sailed softly southward through the afternoon . He sat erect and still . The hours passed . Arren swam a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stern of the boat , for he did not like to cross the line of that dark gaze which , looking west over the sea , seemed to see far beyond the bright horizon-line , beyond the blue of air , beyond the boundaries of light . Sparrowhawk came back from his silence at last and spoke , though not more than a word at a time . Arren 's upbringing had made him quick to sense mood disguised by courtesy or by reserve ; he knew his companion 's heart was heavy . He asked no more questions and in the evening he said , " If I sing , will it disturb your thoughts ? " Sparrowhawk replied with an effort at joking , " That depends upon the singing . " Arren sat with his back against the mast and sang . His voice was no longer high and sweet as when the music master of the Hall of Berila had trained it years ago , striking the harmonies on his tall harp ; nowadays the higher tones of it were husky , and the deep tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sang the Lament for the White Enchanter , that song which Elfarran made when she knew of Morred 's death and waited for her own . Not often is that song sung , nor lightly . Sparrowhawk listened to the young voice , strong , sure , and sad between the red sky and the sea , and the tears came into his eyes , blinding . Arren was silent for a while after that song ; then he began to sing lesser , lighter tunes , softly , beguiling the great monotony of windless air and heaving sea and failing light , as night came on . When he ceased to sing everything was still , the wind down , the waves small , wood and rope barely creaking . Thep83sea lay hushed , and over it the stars came out one by one . Piercing bright to the south a yellow light appeared and sent a shower and splintering of gold across the water . " Look ! A beacon ! " Then after a minute , " Can it be a star ? " Sparrowhawk gazed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be the star Gobardon . It can be seen only in the South Reach . Gobardon means Crown . Kurremkarmerruk taught us that , sailing still farther south would bring , one by one , eight more stars clear of the horizon under Gobardon , making a great constellation , some say of a running man , others say of the Rune Agnen . The Rune of Ending . " They watched it clear the restless sea-horizon and shine forth steadily . " You sang Elfarran 's song , " Sparrowhawk said , " as if you knew her grief , and you 'd made me know it too . . . . Of all the histories of Earthsea , that one has always held me most . The great courage of Morred against despair ; and Serriadh who was born beyond despair , the gentle king . And her , Elfarran . When I did the greatest evil I have ever done , it was to her beauty that I thought I turned ; and I saw her  --  for a moment I saw Elfarran . " A cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat silent , looking at the splendid , baleful , topaz-yellow star . " Which of the heroes is yours ? " the mage asked , and Arren answered with a little hesitancy , " Erreth-Akbe . " " Because he was the greatest ? " " Because he might have ruled all Earthsea , but chose not to , and went on alone and died alone , fighting the dragon Orm on the shore of Selidor . " They sat a while , each following his own thoughts , and then Arren asked , still watching yellow Gobardon , " Is itp84true , then , that the dead can be brought back into life and made to speak to living souls , by magery ? " By the spells of Summoning . It is in our power . But it is seldom done , and I doubt that it is ever wisely done . In this the Master Summoner agrees with me ; he does not use or teach the Lore of Paln , in which such spells are contained . The greatest of them were made by one called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He summoned up the spirits of the heroes and mages , even Erreth-Akbe , to give counsel to the Lords of Pain in their wars and government . But the counsel of the dead is not profitable to the living . Pain came on evil times , and the Grey Mage was driven forth ; he died nameless . " " Is it a wicked thing , then ? " " I should call it a misunderstanding , rather . A misunderstandingof life . Death and life are the same thing  --  like the two sides of my hand , the palm and the back . And still the palm and the back are not the same . . . . They can be neither separated , nor mixed . " " Then no one uses those spells now ? " " I have known only one man who used them freely , not reckoning their risk . For they are risky , dangerous beyond any other magery . Death and life are like the two sides of my hand , I said , but the truth is we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To claim power over what you do not understandis not wise , nor is the end of it likely to be good . " " Who was the man who used them ? " Arren asked . He had not found Sparrowhawk so willing to answer questions before , in this quiet , thoughtful mood ; both of them were consoledby their talk , dark though the subject of it was . " He lived in Havnor . They accounted him a mere sorcerer , but in native power he was a great mage . He made money.  |p85from  his art , showing any who paid him whatever spirit they asked to see , dead wife or husband or child , filling his house with unquiet shadows of old centuries , the fair women of the days of the Kings . I saw him summon from the Dry Land my own old master who was Archmage in my youth , Nemmerle , for a mere trick to entertain the idle . And that great soul came at his call , like a dog to heel . I was angry and challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You compel the dead to come into your house : will you come with me to theirs ? ' And I made him go with me into the Dry Land , though he fought me with all his will and changed his shape and wept aloud when nothing else would do . " " So you killed him ? " Arren whispered , enthralled . " No ! I made him follow me into the land of the dead , and return with me from it . He was afraid . He who summoned the dead to him so easily was more afraid of death  --  of his own death  --  than any man I ever knew . At the wall of stones . ... But I tell you more than a novice ought to know . And you 're not even a novice . " Through the dusk the keen eyes returned Arren 's gaze for a moment , abashing him . " No matter , " said the Archmage . " There is a wall of stones , then , at a certain place on the bourne . Across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living man may go and return again , if he is a niage .... By the wall of stones this man crouched down , on the side of the living , and tried to withstand my will , and could not . He clung to the stones with his hands and cursed and screamed . I have never seen a fear like that ; it sickened me with its own sickness . I should have known by that that I did wrong . I was possessed by anger and by vanity . For he was very strong , and I was eager to prove that I was stronger . " " What did he do afterward  --  when you came back ? " " Grovelled , and swore never to use the Pelnish Lore again ;  |p86kissed  my hand and would have killed me if he dared . He went from Havnor into the West , to Pain perhaps ; I heard years later that he had died . He was white-haired when I knew him , though long-armed and quick like a wrestler . What made me fall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind his name . " " His true name ? " " No ! that I can remember  --  " Then he paused , and for the space of three heartbeats was utterly still . " They called him Cob in Havnor , " he said in a changed , careful voice . It had grown too dark for expression to be seen . Arren saw him turn and look at the yellow star , now higher above the waves and casting across them a broken trail of gold as slender as a spider 's thread . After a long silence he said , " It 's not only in dreams , you see , that we find ourselves facing what is yet to be in what was long forgotten , and speaking what seems nonsense because we will not see itsmeaning. "  |p87Seen  across ten miles of sunlit water , Lorbanery was green , green as the bright moss by a fountain 's rim . Nearby , it broke up into leaves , and tree-trunks , and shadows , and roads , and houses , and the faces and clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make up an island inhabited by men . Yet still , over all , it was green : for every acre of it that was not built or walked upon was given up to the low , round-topped hurhashtrees , on the leaves of which feed the little worms thatp88spin the silk that is made into thread and woven by the men and women and children of Lorbanery . At dusk the air there is full of small grey bats who feed on the little worms . They eat many , but are suffered to do so and are not killed by the silk-weavers , who indeed account it a deed of very evil omen to kill the grey-winged bats . For if human beings live off the worms , they say , surely small bats have the right to do so . The houses were curious , with little windows set randomly , and thatches of hurbah-twigs , all green with moss and lichens . It had been a wealthy isle , as isles of the Reach go , and this was still to be seen in the well-painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looms in the cottages and worksheds , and in the stone piers of the little harbor of Sosara , where several trading galleys might have docked . But there were no galleys in the harbor . The paint on the houses was faded , there was no new furniture , and most of the wheels and looms were still , with dust on them , and spiderwebsbetween pedal and pedal , between warp and frame . " Sorcerers ? " said the mayor of Sosara village , a short man with a face as hard and brown as the soles of his bare feet . " There 's no sorcerers in Lorbanery . Nor ever was . " " Who 'd have thought it ? " said Sparrowhawk admiringly . He was sitting with eight or nine of the villagers , drinking hurbah-berry wine , a thin and bitter vintage . He had of necessity told them that he was in the South Reach hunting emmelstone , but he had in no way disguised himself or his companion , except that Arren had left his sword hidden in the boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him it was not to be seen . The villagers had been sullen and hostile at first and were disposed to turn sullen and hostile again at any moment ; only Sparrowhawk 's adroitness and authority had forced a grudging acceptance from them . " Wonderfulp89men with trees you must have here , " he said now . " What do they do about a late frost on the orchards ? " " Nothing , " said a skinny man at the end of the row of villagers . They all sat in a line with their backs against the inn wall , under the eaves of the thatch . Just past their bare feet the large , soft rain of April pattered on the earth . " Rain 's the peril , not frost , " the mayor said . " Rots the worm cases . No man 's going to stop rain falling . Nor ever did . " He was belligerent about sorcerers and sorcery ; some of the others seemed more wistful on the subject . " Never did used to rain this time of year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow was alive . " " Who ? Old Mildi ? Well , he 's not alive . He 's dead , " said the mayor . " Used to call him the Orcharder , " the skinny man said . " Aye . Called him the Orcharder , " said another one . Silence descended , like the rain . Inside the window of the one-roomed inn Arren sat . He had found an old lute hung on the wall , a long-necked , three-stringed lute such as they play in the Isle of Silk , and he was playing with it now , learning to draw its music from it , not much louder than the patter of the rain on the thatch . " In the markets in Hort Town , " said Sparrowhawk , " I saw stuff sold as silk of Lorbanery . Some of it was silk . But none of it was silk of Lorbanery . " The seasons have been poor , " said the skinny man . " Four years , five years now . " " Five years it is since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munching , self-satisfied voice , " since old Mildi died , aye , die he did , and not near the age I am . Died on Fallows Eve he did . " " Scarcity puts up the prices , " said the mayor . " For one boltp90of semi-fine blue-dyed we get now what we used to get for three bolts . " " If we get it . Where 's the ships ? And the blue 's false , " said the skinny man , thus bringing on a half-hour argument concerning the quality of the dyes they used in the great worksheds . " Who makes the dyes ? " Sparrowhawk asked , and a new hassle broke out . The upshot of it was that the whole process of dyeing had been overseen by a family who , in fact , called themselves wizards ; but if they ever had been wizards they had lost their art , and nobody else had found it , as the skinny man remarked sourly . For they all agreed , except the mayor , that the famous blue dyes of Lorbanery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " worn by queens in Havnor long ago , were not what they had been . Something had gone out of them . The unseasonable rains were at fault , or the dyeearths , or the refiners . " Or the eyes , " said the skinny man , " of men who could n't tell the true azure from blue mud , " and he glared at the mayor . The mayor did not take up the challenge ; they fell silent again . The thin wine seemed only to acidify their tempers , and their faces looked glum . There was no sound now but the rustle of rain on the uncountable leaves of the orchards of the valley , and the whisper of the sea down at the end of the street , and the murmur of the lute in the darkness within doors . " Can he sing , that girlish lad of yours ? " asked the mayor . " Aye , he can sing . Arren ! Sing a measure for us , lad . " " I can not get this lute to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , smiling . " It wants to weep . What would you hear , my hosts ? " " Something new , " growled the mayor.  |p91The  lute thrilled a little ; he had the touch of it already . " This might be new here , " he said . Then he sang . By the white straits of Solea and the bowed red branches that bent their blossoms over her bowed head , heavywith sorrow for the lost lover , by the red branch and the white branchand the sorrow unceasing do I swear , Serriadh , son of my mother and of Morred , to remember the wrong done forever , forever . They were still : the bitter faces and the shrewd , the hardworkedhands and bodies . They sat still in the warm rainy Southern dusk , and heard that song like the cry of the grey swan of the cold seas of Ea , yearning , bereft . For a while after the song was over they kept still . " That 's a queer music , " said one , uncertainly . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lorbanery in all time and space , said , " Foreign music 's always queer and gloomy . " " Give us some of yours , " said Sparrowhawk . " I 'd like to hear a cheery stave myself . The lad will always sing of old ( lead heroes . " " I 'll do that , " said the last speaker , and hemmed a bit , and started out to sing about a lusty , trusty barrel of wine , and a hey , ho , and about we go ! But nobody joined him in the chorus , and he went flat on the hey , ho . " ' There 's no more proper singing , " he said angrily . " It 's thep92young people 's fault , always chopping and changing the way things are done , and not learning the old songs . " " It 's not that , " said the skinny man , " there 's no more proper anything . Nothing goes right anymore . " " Aye , aye , aye , " wheezed the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what . The luck 's run out . " After that there was not much to say . The villagers departedby twos and threes , until Sparrowhawk was left alone outside the window and Arren inside it . And then Sparrowhawklaughed , at last . But it was not a merry laugh . The innkeeper 's shy wife came and spread out beds for them on the floor and went away , and they lay down to sleep . But the high rafters of the room were an abode of bats . In and out the unglazed window the bats flew all night long , chittering very high . Only at dawn did they all return and settle , each composing itself in a little , neat , grey packagehanging from a rafter upside down . Perhaps it was the restlessness of the bats that made Arren 's sleep uneasy . It was many nights now since he had slept ashore ; his body was not used to the immobility of earth and insisted to him as he fell asleep that he was rocking , rocking . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wake with a great start . When at last he got to sleep , he dreamt he was chained in the hold of the slaver 's ship ; there were others chained with him , but they were all dead . He woke from this dream more than once , struggling to get free of it , but falling to sleep at once reenteredit . At last it seemed to him that he was all alone on the ship , but still chained so that he could not move . Then a curious , slow voice spoke in his ear . " Loose your bonds , " it said . " Loose your bonds . " He tried to move then , and moved : he stood up . He was on some vast , dim moor , under a heavyp93sky . There was horror in the earth and in the thick air , an enormity of horror . This place was fear , was fear itself ; and he was in it , and there were no paths . He must find the way , but there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like an ant , and the place was huge , endless . He tried to walk , stumbled , woke . The fear was inside him , now that he was awake , and he was not inside it : yet it was no less huge and endless . He felt choked by the black darkness of the room , and looked for stars in the dim square that was the window , but though the rain had ceased there were no stars . He lay awake and was afraid , and the bats flew in and out on noiseless leather wings . Sometimes he heard their thin voices at the very limit of his hearing . The morning came bright , and they were early up . Sparrowhawkinquired earnestly for emmelstone . Though none of the townsfolk knew what emmelstone was , they all had theories about it and quarreled over them ; and he listened , though he listened for news of something other than emmelstone . At last he and Arren took a way that the mayor suggested to them , toward the quarries where the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This will be the house , " he said . " They said that that familyof dyers and discredited magicians lives on this road . " " Is it any use to talk to them ? " said Arren , remembering I fare all too well . " There is a center to this bad luck , " said the mage , harshly . " There is a place where the luck runs out . I need a guide to that place ! " And he went on , and Arren must follow . The house stood apart among its own orchards , a fine building of stone , but it and all its acreage had gone long uncared for . Cocoons of ungathered silkworms hung discol/ored among the ragged branches , and the ground beneath was thick with a papery litter of dead grubs and moths . All about the house under the close-set trees there hung an odor of decay , and as they came to it Arren suddenly remembered the horror that had been on him in the night . Before they reached the door it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaring with reddened eyes and shouting , " Out , curse you , thieves , slanderers , lackwits , liars , and misbegotten fools ! Get out , out , go ! The ill chance be on you forever ! " Sparrowhawk stopped , looking somewhat amazed , and quickly raised his hand in a curious gesture . He said one word , " Avert ! " At that the woman stopped yelling . She stared at him . " Why did you do that ? " " To turn your curse aside . " She stared a while longer and said at last , hoarsely , " For-eigners ? " " From the North . " She came forward . At first Arren had been inclined to laugh at her , an old woman screeching on her doorstep , but close to her he felt only shame . She was foul and ill-clothed , and her breath stank , and her eyes had a terrible stare of pain . " I have no power to curse , " she said . " No power . " She imitated Sparrowhawk 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from ? " He nodded . He watched her steadily , and she returned his gaze . Presently her face began to work and change , and she said , " Where 's thy stick ? " " I do not show it here , sister . " " No , you should not . It will keep you from life . Like my power : it kept me from life . So I lost it . I lost all the things I knew , all the words and names . They came by little stringsp95like spiderwebs out of my eyes and mouth . There is a hole in the world , and the light is running out of it . And the words go with the light . Did you know that ? My son sits staring all day at the dark , looking for the hole in the world . He says he would see better if he were blind . He has lost his hand as a dyer . We were the Dyers of Lorbanery . Look ! " She shook before them her muscular , thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaky mixture of ineradicable dyes . It never comes off the skin , " she said , " but the mind washes clean . It wo n't hold the colors . Who are you ? " Sparrowhawk said nothing . Again his eyes held the woman 's ; and Arren , standing aside , watched uneasily . All at once she trembled and said in a whisper , " I know thee  --  " " Aye . Like knows like , sister . " It was strange to see how she pulled away from the mage in terror , wanting to flee him , and yearned toward him as if to kneel at his feet . He took her hand and held her . " Would you have yourpower back , the skills , the names ? I can give you that . " " You are the Great Man , " she whispered . " You are theKing of the Shadows , the Lord of the Dark Place  --  " " I am not . I am no king . I am a man , a mortal , yourbrother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I will . " " But you will come back and live forever . " " Not I. Nor any man . " " Then you are not  --  not the Great One in the darkness , " she said , frowning , and looking at him a little askance , with less fear . " But you are a Great One . Are there two ? What is your name ? " Sparrowhawk 's stern face softened a moment . " I cannotp96tell you that , " he said gently . " I 'll tell you a secret , " she said . She stood straighter now , facing him , and there was the echo of an old dignity in her voice and bearing . " I do not want to live and live and live forever . I would rather have back the names of things . But they are all gone . Names do n't matter now . There are no more secrets . Do you want to know my name ? " Her eyes filled with light , her fists clenched , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then she screamed aloud , " Akaren ! Akaren ! My name is Akaren ! Now they all know my secret name , my true name , and there are no secrets , and there is no truth , and there is no death  --  death  --  death ! " She screamed the word sobbing , and spittle flew from her lips . " Be still , Akaren ! " She was still . Tears ran down her face , which was dirty , and streaked with locks of her uncombed , grey hair . Sparrowhawk took that wrinkled , tear-blubbered face between his hands and very lightly , very tenderly , kissed her on the eyes . She stood motionless , her eyes closed . Then with his lips close to her ear he spoke a little in the Old Speech , once more kissed her , and let her go . She opened clear eyes and looked at him a while with a brooding , wondering gaze . So a newborn child looks at its mother ; so a mother looks at her child . She turned slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed it behind her : all in silence , with the still look of wonder on her face . In silence the mage turned and started back toward the road . Arren followed him . He dared ask no question . Presentlythe mage stopped , there in the ruined orchard , and said , " I took her name from her and gave her a new one . And thus in some sense a rebirth . There was no other help or hope for her . "  |p97His  voice was strained and stifled . " She was a woman of power , " he went on . " No mere witch or potion-maker , but a woman of art and skill , using her craft for the making of the beautiful , a proud woman and honorable . That was her life . And it is all wasted . " He turned abruptly away , walked off into the orchard aisles , and there stood beside a tree-trunk , his back turned . Arren waited for him in the hot , leaf-speckled sunlight . He knew that Sparrowhawk was ashamed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing the boy could do or say . But his heart went out utterly to his companion , not now with that first romantic ardor and adoration , but gainfully , as if a link were drawn forth from the very inmost of it and forged into an unbreaking bond . For in this love he now felt there was compassion : without which love is untempered , and is not whole , and does not last . Presently Sparrowhawk returned to him through the green shade of the orchard . Neither said anything , and they went on side by side . It was hot already ; last night 's rain had dried , old dust rose under their feet on the road . Earlier the day had seemed dreary and insipid to Arren , as if infected by his dreams ; now he took pleasure in the bite of the sunlight and the relief of shade , and enjoyed walking without brooding about their destination . This was just as well , for they accomplished nothing . The afternoon was spent in talking with the men who mined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be emmelstone . As they trudged back to Sosara with the late sun pounding on their heads and necks , Sparrowhawk remarked , " It 's blue malachite ; but I doubt they 'll know the diftcrencein Sosara either . " ' They 're strange here , " Arren said . " It 's that way withp98everything ; they do n't know the difference . Like what one of them said to the headman last night , You would n't know the true azure from blue mud . . . . ' They complain about bad times , but they do n't know when the bad times began ; they say the work 's shoddy , but they do n't improve it ; they do n't even know the difference between an artisan and a spell-worker , between handicraft and the art magic . It 's as if they had no lines and distinctions and colors clear in their heads . Everything 's the same to them ; everything 's grey . " " Aye , " said the mage , thoughtfully . He stalked along for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though a short man , he walked with a long stride . " What is it they 're missing ? " Arren said without hesitation , " Joy in life . " " Aye , " said Sparrowhawk again , accepting Arren 's statementand pondering it for some time . " I 'm glad , " he said at last , " that you can think for me , lad . . . . I feel tired and stupid . I 've been sick at heart since this morning , since we talked to her who was Akaren . I do not like waste and destruction . I do not want an enemy . If I must have an enemy , I do not want to seek him , and find him , and meet him . . . . If one must hunt , the prize should be a treasure , not a detestablething . " " An enemy , my lord ? " said Arren . Sparrowhawk nodded . " When she talked about the Great Man , the King of Shadows  --  ? " Sparrowhawk nodded again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we must come not only to a place , but to a person . This is evil , evil , what passes on this island : this loss of craft and pride , this joylessness , this waste . This is the work of an evil will . But a will not even bent here , not even noticing Akarenp99or Lorbanery . The track we hunt is a track of wreckage , as if we followed a runaway cart down a mountainside and watched it set off an avalanche . " " Could she  --  Akaren  --  tell you more about this enemy  --  who he is and where he is , or what he is ? " " Not now , lad , " the mage said in a soft but rather bleak voice . " No doubt she could have . In her madness there was still wizardry . Indeed her madness was her wizardry . But I could not hold her to answer me . She was in too much pain . " And he walked on with his head somewhat hunched between his shoulders , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . Arren turned , hearing a scuffle of feet behind them on the road . A man was running after them , a good way off but catching up fast . The dust of the road and his long , wiry hair made aureoles of red about him in the westering light , and his long shadow hopped fantastically along the trunks and aisles of the orchards by the road . " Listen ! " he shouted . " Stop ! I found it ! I found it ! " He caught up with them in a rush . Arren 's hand went first to the air where his sword hilt might have been , then to the air where his lost knife had been , and then made itself into a fist , all in half a second . He scowled and moved forward . The man was a full head taller than Sparrowhawk , and broad-shouldered : a panting , raving , wild-eyed madman . " I found it ! " he kept saying , while Arren , trying to dominate him by a stern , threatening voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The man tried to get around him , to Sparrowhawk ; Arren stepped in front of him again . " You are the Dyer of Lorbanery , " Sparrowhawk said . Then Arren felt he had been a fool , trying to protect his companion ; and he stepped aside , out of the way . For at sixp100words from the mage , the madman stopped his panting and the clutching gesture of his big , stained hands ; his eyes grew quieter ; he nodded his head . " I was the dyer , " he said , " but now I ca n't dye . " Then he looked askance at Sparrowhawk and grinned ; he shook his head with its reddish , dusty bush of hair . " You took away my mother 's name , " he said . " Now I do n't know her , and she does n't know me . She loves me well enough still , but she 's left me . She 's dead . " Arren 's heart contracted , but he saw that Sparrowhawk merely shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " she 's not dead . " " But she will be . She 'll die . " " Aye . That 's a consequence of being alive , " the mage said . The Dyer seemed to puzzle this over for a minute , and then came right up to Sparrowhawk , seized his shoulders , and bent over him . He moved so fast that Arren could not prevent him , but Arren did come up very close , and so heard his whisper , " I found the hole in the darkness . The King was standing there . He watches it ; he rules it . He had a little flame , a little candle in his hand . He blew on it and it went out . Then he blew on it again and it burned ! It burned ! " Sparrowhawk made no protest at being held and whispered at . He simply asked , " Where were you when you saw that ? " " In bed . " " Dreaming ? " " No . " " Across the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a suddenly sober tone , and as if uncomfortable . He let the mage go , and took a step back from him . " No , I  --  I do n't know where it is . I found it . But I do n't know where . " " That 's what I 'd like to know , " said Sparrowhawk.  | " I can help you . " " How ? " " You have a boat . You came here in it and you 're going on . Are you going on west ? That 's the way . The way to the place where he comes out . There has to be a place , a place here , because he 's alive  --  not just the spirits , the ghosts , that come over the wall , not like that ,  --  you ca n't bring anything but souls over the wall , but this is the body ; this is the flesh immortal . I saw the flame rise in the darkness at his breath , the flame that was out . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild beauty in it in the long , red-gold light . " I know that he has overcome death . I know it . I gave my wizardryto know it . I was a wizard once ! And you know it , and you are going there . Take me with you . " The same light shone on Sparrowhawk 's face , but left it unmoved and harsh . " I am trying to go there , " he said . " Let me go with you ! " Sparrowhawk nodded briefly . " If you 're ready when we sail , " he said , as coldly as before . The Dyer backed away from him another step and stood watching him , the exaltation in his face clouding slowly over until it was replaced by a strange , heavy look ; it was as if reasoning thought were laboring to break through the storm of words and feelings and visions that confused him . Finally he turned around without a word and began to run hack down the road , into the haze of dust that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long breath of relief . Sparrowhawk also sighed , though not as if his heart were any easier . " Well , " he said . " Strange roads have strange guides . Let 's go on . " Arren fell into step beside him . " You wo n't take him with us ? " he asked . " That 's up to him . "  |p102With  a flash of anger Arren thought : It 's up to me , also . But he did not say anything , and they went on together in silence . They were not well-received on their return to Sosara . Everything on a little island like Lorbanery is known as soon as it is done , and no doubt they had been seen turning aside to the Dyers ' House and talking to the madman on the road . The innkeeper served them uncivilly , and his wife acted scared to death of them . In the evening when the men of the village came to sit under the eaves of the inn , they made much displayof not speaking to the foreigners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had not much wit to pass around and soon ran short of jollity . They all sat in silencefor a long time , and at last the mayor said to Sparrowhawk , " Did you find your blue rocks ? " " I found some blue rocks , " Sparrowhawk replied politely . " Sopli showed you where to find ' em , no doubt . " Ha , ha , ha , went the other men , at this masterstroke ofirony . " Sopli would be the red-haired man ? " " The madman . You called on his mother in the morning . " " I was looking for a wizard , " said the wizard . The skinny man , who sat nearest him , spat into the darkness . " What for ? " " I thought I might find out about what I 'm looking for . " " People come to Lorbanery for silk , " the mayor said . " They do n't come for stones . They do n't come for charms . Or arm-wavings and jibber-jabber and sorcerers ' tricks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right . He 's right , " said others . " And we do n't want any other sort here , people from foreignparts snooping about and prying into our business . "  | " That 's right . He 's right , " came the chorus . " If there was any sorcerer around that was n't crazy , we 'd give him an honest job in the sheds , but they do n't know how to do honest work . " " They might , if there were any to do , " said Sparrowhawk . " Your sheds are empty , the orchards are untended , the silk in your warehouses was all woven years ago . What do you do , here in Lorbanery ? " " We look after our own business , " the mayor snapped , but the skinny man broke in excitedly , " Why do n't the ships come , tell us that ! What are they doing in Hort Town ? Is it because our work 's been shoddy ?  --  " He was interrupted by angry denials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mayor shook his fist in Sparrowhawk 's face , another drew a knife . Their mood had gone wild . Arren was on his feet at once . He looked at Sparrowhawk , expecting to see him stand up in the sudden radiance of the magelight and strike them dumb with his revealed power . But he did not . He sat there and looked from one to another and listened to their menaces . And gradually they fell quiet , as if they could not keep up anger any more than they could keep up merriment . The knife was sheathed ; the threats turned to sneers . They began to go off like dogs leaving a dog-fight , some strutting and some sneaking . When the two were left alone Sparrowhawk got up , went inside the inn , and took a long draft of water from the jug beside the door . " Come , lad , " he said . " I 've had enough of this . " " To the boat ? " " Aye . " He put down two trade-counters of silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoisted up their light park of clothing . Arren was tired and sleepy , but he lookedp104around the room of the inn , stuffy and bleak , and all a-flitter up in the rafters with the restless bats ; he thought of last night in that room and followed Sparrowhawk willingly . He thought , too , as they went down Sosara 's one , dark street , that going now they would give the madman Sopli the slip . But when they came to the harbor he was waiting for them on the pier . " There you are , " said the mage . " Get aboard , if you want to come . " Without a word , Sopli got down into the boat and crouched beside the mast , like a big , unkempt dog . At this Arren rebelled . " My lord ! " he said . Sparrowhawk turned ; they stood face to face on the pier above the boat . " They are all mad on this island , but I thought you were not . Why do you take him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more madness ? To death by drowning , or a knife in the back ? " " To death , but by what road I do not know . " Arren spoke with heat , and though Sparrowhawk answered quietly , there was something of a fierce note in his voice . He was not used to being questioned . But ever since Arren had tried to protect him from the madman on the road that afternoon and had seen how vain and unneeded his protection was , he had felt a bitterness , and all that uprush of devotion he had felt in the morning was spoilt and wasted . He was unable to protect Sparrowhawk ; he was not permitted to make any decisions ; he was unable , or was not permitted , even to understand the nature of their quest . He was merely dragged along on it , useless as a child . But he was not a child . " I would not quarrel with you , my lord , " he said as coldly as he could . " But this  --  this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . We go where reason will not take us . Will you come , or will you not ? " Tears of anger sprang into Arren 's eyes . " I said I would come with you and serve you . I do not break my word . " " That is well , " the mage said grimly and made as if to turn away . Then he faced Arren again . " I need you , Arren ; and you need me . For I will tell you now that I believe this way we go is yours to follow , not out of obedience or loyalty to me , but because it was yours to follow before you ever saw me ; before you ever set foot on Roke ; before you sailed from Enlad . You can not turn back from it . " His voice had not softened . Arren answered him as grimly , " How should I turn back , with no boat , here on the edge of We world ? " " This the edge of the world ? No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Arren nodded once and swung down into the boat . Sparrowhawkloosed the line and spoke a light wind into the sail . Once away from the looming , empty docks of Lorbanery the air blew cool and clean out of the dark north , and the moon broke silver from the sleek sea before them and rode upon their left as they turned southward to coast the isle.  |p106The  madman , the Dyer of Lorbanery , sat huddled up against the mast , his arms wrapped around his knees and his headhunched down . His mass hair looked black in themoonlight . Sparrowhav I a - nself up in a blanketand gone to sleep in the stern or boat . Neither of them stirred . Arren sat up in the prow ; he had sworn to himself to watch all night . If the mage chose to assume that their lunatic passenger would not assault him or Arren in thep107night , that was all very well for him ; Arren , however , would make his own assumptions and undertake his own responsibilities . But the night was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Huddled by the mast , Sopli snored , long , soft snores . Softly the boat moved onward ; softly Arren slid into sleep . He started awake once and saw the moon scarcely higher ; he abandoned his self-righteous guardianship , made himself comfortable , and went to sleep . He dreamt again , as he seemed always to do on this voyage , and at first the dreams were fragmentary but strangely sweet and reassuring . In place of Look f ar 's mast a tree grew , with great , arching arms of foliage ; swans guided the boat , swooping on strong wings before it ; far ahead , over the beryl-green sea , shone a city of white towers . Then he was in one of those towers , climbing the steps which spiralled upward , running up them lightly and eagerly . These scenes hanged and recurred and led into others , which passed withouttrace ; but suddenly he was in the dreaded , dull twilight on the moors , and the horror grew in him until he could not breathe . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time he realized that to go forward here was to go in a circle and come round on one 's own tracks again . Yet he must get out , get away . It grew more and more urgent . He began to run . As he ran , the circles narrowed in and the ground began to slant . He was running in the darkeninggloom , faster and faster ,  - -  'und the sinking inner lipof a pit , an enormous whi icking down to darkness : and as he knew this , his fora d d he feii . " What 's the matter , Arren ? " Sparrowhawk spoke to him from the stern . Grey dawn held the sky and sea still.  | " Nothing . " " The nightmare ? " " Nothing . " Arren was cold , and his right arm ached from having been cramped under him . He shut his eyes against the growing light and thought , " He hints of this and hints of that , but he will never tell me clearly where we 're going , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he drags this madman with us . Which is maddest , the lunatic or I , for coming with him ? The two of them may understand each other ; it 's the wizards who are mad now , Sopli said . I could have been at home by now , at home in the Hall in Berila , in my room with the carven walls and the red rugs on the floor and a fire in the hearth , waking up to go out a-hawking with my father . Why did I come with him ? Why did he bring me ? Because it 's my way to go , he says , but that 's wizard 's talk , making things seem great by great words . But the meaning of the words is always somewhere else . If I have any way to go , it 's to my home , not wandering senselessly across the Reaches . I haveduties at home and am shirking them . If he really thinks there is some enemy of wizardry at work , why did he come alone , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  a hundred of them . He could have brought an army of warriors , a fleet of ships . Is this how a great peril is met , by sending out an old man and a boy in a boat ? This is mere folly . He is mad himself ; it is as he said , he seeks death . He seeks death , and wants to take me with him . But I am not mad and not old ; I will not die ; I will not go withhim . " He sat up on his elbow , looking forward . The moon that had risen before them as they left Sosara Bay was again beforethem , sinking . Behind , in the east , day came wan andp109dull . There were no clouds , but a faint , sickly overcast . Later in the day the sun grew hot , but it shone veiled , without splendor . All day long they coasted Lorbanery , low and green to their right hand . A light wind blew off the land and filled their sail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeze died down . Sparrowhawk spoke the magewind into the sail , and like a falcon loosed from the wrist , Look f ar started and fled forward eagerly , putting the Isle of Silk behind . Sopli the Dyer had cowered in the same place all day , evidentlyafraid of the boat and afraid of the sea , seasick and wretched . He spoke now , hoarsely . " Are we going west ? " The sunset was right in his face ; but Sparrowhawk , patientwith his stupidest questions , nodded . " To Obehol ? " " Obehol lies west of Lorbanery . " " A long way west . Maybe the place is there . " " What is it like , the place ? " " 1-low do I know ? How could I see it ? It 's not on Lorbanery ! I hunted for it for years , four years , five years , in the dark , at night , shutting my eyes , always with him calling Come , come , but I could n't come . I 'm no lord of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there 's a place to come to in the light , under the sun too . That 's what Mildi and my mother would n't understand . They kept looking in the dark . Then old Mildi died , and my mother lost her mind . She ' ingot the spells we use in the dyeing , and it affected her mind . She wanted to die , but I told her to wait . Wait 611 1 find the place . There must be a place . If the dead can come back to life in the world , there must be a place in the world where it happens . "  | " Are the dead coming back to life ? " " I thought you knew such things , " Sopli said after a pause , looking askance at Sparrowhawk . " I seek to know them . " Sopli said nothing . The mage suddenly looked at him , a direct , compelling gaze , though his tone was gentle : " Are you looking for a way to live forever , Sopli ? " Sopli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shaggy , brownish-red head in his arms , locking his hands across his ankles , and rocked himself a little back and forth . It seemed that when he was frightened he took this position ; and when he was in it , he would not speak or take any notice of what was said . Arren turned away from him in despair and disgust . How could they go on , with Sopli , for days or weeks , in an eighteen-foot boat ? It was like sharing a body with a diseased soul ... . Sparrowhawk came up beside Arren in the prow and knelt with one knee on the thwart , looking into the sallow evening . He said , " The man has a gentle spirit . " Arren did not answer this . He asked coldly , " What is Obehol ? I never heard the name . " " I know its name and place on the charts ; no more ... . Look there : the companions of Gobardon ! " The great topaz-colored star was higher in the south now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white star to the left and a bluish-white one to the right , forming a triangle . " Have they names ? " " The Master Namer did not know . Maybe the men of Obehol and Wellogy have names for them . I do not know . We go now into strange seas , Arren , under the Sign of End-ing. "  |p111The  boy did not answer , looking with a kind of loathing at the bright , nameless stars above the endless water . As they sailed westward day after day , the warmth of the southern spring lay on the waters , and the sky was clear . Yet it seemed to Arren that there was a dullness in the light , as if it fell aslant through glass . The sea was lukewarm when he swam , bringing little refreshment . Their salt food had no savor . There was no freshness or brightness in anything , unless it were at night , when the stars burned with a greater radiance than he had ever seen in them . He would lie and watch them till he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of the moors or the pit or a valley hemmed round by cliffs or a long road going downward under a low sky ; always the dim light , and the horror in him , and the hopeless effort to escape . He never spoke of this to Sparrowhawk . He did not speak of anything important to him , nothing but the small daily incidents of their sailing ; and Sparrowhawk , who had always had to be drawn out , was now habitually silent . Arren saw now what a fool he had been to entrust himself body and soul to this restless and secretive man , who let impulsemove him and made no effort to control his life , nor even to save it . For now the fey mood was on him ; and that , Arrcn thought , was because he dared not face his own failurethe failure of wizardry as a great power among men . It was clear now that to those who knew the secrets , there were not many secrets to that art magic from which Sparrowha+wk , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power . There was not much more to it than the use of wind and weather , the knowledge of healingherbs , and a skillful show of such illusions as mists andp112lights and shape-changes , which could awe the ignorant , but which were mere tricks . Reality was not changed . There was nothing in magery that gave a man true power over men ; nor was it any use against death . The mages lived no longer than ordinary men . All their secret words could not put off for one hour the coming of their death . Even in small matters magery was not worth counting on . Sparrowhawk was always miserly about employing his arts ; they went by the world 's wind whenever they might , they fished for food , and they spared their water , like any sailors . After four days of interminable tacking into a fitful headwind , Arren asked him if he would not speak a little followingwind into the sail , and when he shook his head , said , " Why not ? " " I would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Sparrowhawk , " nor lay a stone on an overburdened back . " It was not clear whether he spoke of himself or of the world at large . Always his answers were grudging , hard to understand . There , thought Arren , lay the very heart of wizardry : to hint at mighty meanings while saying nothing at all , and to make doing nothing at all seem the very crown of wisdom . Arren had tried to ignore Sopli , but it was impossible ; and in any case he soon found himself in a kind of alliance with the madman . Sopli was not so mad , or not so simply mad , as his wild hair and fragmented talk made him appear . Indeed the maddest thing about him was perhaps his terror of the water . To come into a boat had taken desperate courage , and he never really got the edge worn off his fear ; he kept his head down so much so that he would not have to see the waterheaving and lapping about him . To stand up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mast . The first time Arren decided on a swim and dived off the prow , Sopli shouted ourp113in horror ; when Arren came climbing back into the boat , the poor man was green with shock . " I thought you were drowning yourself , " he said , and Arren had to laugh . That afternoon , when Sparrowhawk sat meditating , unheedingand unhearing , Sopli came hitching cautiously over the thwarts to Arren . He said in a low voice , " You do n't want to die , do you ? " " Of course not . " " He does , " Sopli said , with a little shift of his lower jaw toward Sparrowhawk . " Why do you say that ? " Arren took a lordly tone. , which indeed came naturally to him , and Sopli accepted it as natural , though he was ten or fifteen years older than Arren . He replied with ready civility , though in his usual fragmentary way , " He wants to get to the secret place . But I do n't know why . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in . . . the promise . " " What promise ? " Sopli glanced up at him sharply , something of his ruined manhood in his eyes ; but Arren 's will was stronger . He answeredvery low , " You know . Life . Eternal life . " A great chill went through Arren 's body . He remembered his dreams : the moor , the pit , the cliffs , the dim light . That was death ; that was the horror of death . It was from death he must escape , must find the way . And on the doorsill stood the figure crowned with shadow , holding out a little light no larger than a pearl , the glimmer of immortal life . Arren met Sopli 's eyes for the first time : light brown eyes , very clear ; in them he saw that he had understood at last , and that Sopli shared his knowledge . " He , " the Dyer said , with his twitch of the jaw toward Sparrowhawk , " he wo n't give up his name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow . " " Have you seen it ? " " In the dark , in my mind . That 's not enough . I want to get there ; I want to see it . In the world , with my eyes . What if I  --  what if I died and could n't find the way , the place ? Most people ca n't find it ; they do n't even know it 's there . There 's only some of us have the power . But it 's hard , because you have to give the power up to get there . . . . No more words . No more names . It is too hard to do in the mind . And when you  --  die , your mind  --  dies . " He stuck each time on the word . " I want to know I can come back . I want to be there . On the side of life . I want to live , to be safe . I hate  --  I hate this water .... " The Dyer drew his limbs together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiry-red head down between his shoulders , to shut out the sight of the sea . But Arren did not shun his conversation after that , knowing that Sopli shared not only his vision , but his fear ; and that , if worse came to worst , Sopli might aid him against Sparrowhawk . Always they sailed , slowly in the calms and fitful breezes , to the west , where Sparrowhawk pretended that Sopli guided them . But Sopli did not guide them , he who knew nothing of the sea , had never seen a chart , never been in a boat , dreaded the water with a sick dread . It was the mage who guided them and led them deliberately astray . Arren saw this now and saw the reason of it . The Archmage knew that they and others like them were seeking eternal life , had been promised it or drawn toward it , and might find it . In his pride , his overweening pride as Archmage , he feared lest they might gain it ; he envied them , and feared them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to sailp115out onto the Open Sea beyond all lands until they were utterlyastray and could never come back to the world , and there they would die of thirst . For he would die himself , to prevent them from eternal life . Every now and then there would come a moment when Sparrowhawk spoke to Arren of some small matter of managingthe boat or swam with him in the warm sea or bade him good night under the great stars , when all these ideas seemed utter nonsense to the boy . He would look at his companion and see him , that hard , harsh , patient face , and he would think , " This is my lord and friend . " And it seemed unbelievable to him that he had doubted . But a little while later he would be doubting again , and he and Sopli would exchangeglances , warning each other of their mutual enemy . Every day the sun shone hot , yet dull . Its light lay like a gloss on the slow-heaving sea . The water was blue , the sky blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they turned the sail to catch them and slowly crept on toward no end . One afternoon they had at last a light following wind ; and Sparrowhawk pointed upward , near sunset , saying , " Look . " High above the mast a line of sea-geese wavered like a black rune drawn across the sky . The geese flew westward : and following , Lookfar came on the next day in sight of a great island . " That 's it , " Sopli said . " That land . We must go there . " " The place you seek is there ? " " Yes . We must land there . This is as far as we can go . " " This land will be Obehol . Beyond it in the South Reach is another island , Wellogy . And in the West Reach are islandslying farther west than Wellogy . Are you certain , St pii ? "  |p116The  Dyer of Lorbanery grew angry , so that the wincing look came back into his eyes ; but he did not talk madly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him many days ago on Lorbanery . " Yes . We must land here . We have gone far enough . The place we seek is here . Do you want me to swear that I know it ? Shall I swear by my name ? " " You can not , " Sparrowhawk said , his voice hard , looking up at Sopli who was taller than he ; Sopli had stood up , holdingon tight to the mast , to look at the land ahead . " Do n't try , Sopli . " The Dyer scowled as if in rage or pain . He looked at the mountains lying blue with distance before the boat , over the heaving , trembling plain of water , and said , " You took me as guide . This is the place . We must land here . " " We 'll land in any case ; we must have water , " said Sparrowhawk , and went to the tiller . Sopli sat down in his place by the mast , muttering . Arren heard him say , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times , and each time he said it , he scowled again as if in pain . They beat closer to the island on a north wind and coasted it seeking a bay or landing , but the breakers beat thunderous in the hot sunlight on all the northern shore . Inland green mountains stood baking in that light , tree-clothed to the peaks . Rounding a cape , they came at last in sight of a deep crescent bay with white sand beaches . Here the waves came in quietly , their force held off by the cape , and a boat might land . No sign of human life was visible on the beach or in the forests above it ; they had not seen a boat , a roof , a wisp of smoke . The light breeze dropped as soon as Look far entered the bay . It was still , silent , hot . Arren took the oars , Sparrowhawk steered . The creak of the oars in the locksp117was the only sound . The green peaks loomed above the bay , closing in around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arren heard the blood drumming in his ears . Sopli had left the safety of the mast and crouched in the prow , holding onto the gunwales , staring and straining forward to the land . Sparrowhawk 's dark , scarred face shone with sweat as if it had been oiled ; his glance shifted continuallyfrom the low breakers to the foliage-screened bluffs above . " Now , " he said to Arren and the boat . Arren took three great strokes with the oars , and lightly Look f ar came up on the sand . Sparrowhawk leapt out to push the boat clear up on the last impetus of the waves . As he put his hands out to push , he stumbled and half-fell , catching himself against the stern . With a mighty strain he dragged the boat back into the water on the outward wash of the wave , and flounderedin over the gunwale as she hung between sea and shore . " Row ! " he gasped out , and crouched on all fours , streaming with water and trying to get his breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two feet long . Where had he gotten it ? Another spear appeared as Arren hung bewildered on the oars ; it struck a thwart edgewise , splintering the wood , and rebounded end over end . On the low bluffs over the beach , under the trees , figures moved , darting and crouching . There were little whistling , whirring noises in the air . Arren suddenly bent his head between his shoulders , bent his back , and rowed with powerful strokes : two to clear the shallows , three to turn the boat , and away . Sopli , in the prow of the boat behind Arren 's back , began to shout . Arren 's arms were seized suddenly so that the oars shot up out of the water . The butt of one struck him in the pit of the stomach , so that for a moment he was blind andp118breathless . " Turn back ! Turn back ! " Sopli was shouting . The boat leapt in the water all at once , and rocked . Arren turned as soon as he had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not in the boat . All around them the deep water of the bay heaved and dazzled in the sunlight . Stupidly , Arren looked behind him again , then at Sparrowhawkcrouching in the stern . " There , " Sparrowhawk said , pointing alongside , but there was nothing , only the sea and the dazzle of the sun . A spear from a throwing-stick fell short of the boat by a few yards , entered the water noiselessly , and vanished . Arren rowed ten or twelve hard strokes , then backed water and looked once more at Sparrowhawk . Sparrowhawk 's hands and left arm were bloody ; he held a wad of sailcloth to his shoulder . The bronze-headed spear lay in the bottom of the boat . He had not been holding it when Arren first saw it ; it had been standing out from the hollow of his shoulder where the point had gone in . He was scanning the water between them and the white beach , where some tiny figures hopped and wavered in the heat-glare . At last he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never came up . " " Is he drowned ? " Arren asked , unbelieving . Sparrowhawk nodded . Arren rowed on until the beach was only a white line beneath the forests and the great green peaks . Sparrowhawk sat by the tiller , holding the wad of cloth to his shoulder but paying no heed to it . " Did a spear hit him ? " " He jumped . " " But he  --  he could n't swim . He was afraid of the water ! "  | " Aye . Mortally afraid . He wanted . . . . He wanted to come to land . " " Why did they attack us ? Who are they ? " " They must have thought us enemies . Will you ... give me a hand with this a moment ? " Arren saw then that the cloth he held pressed against his shoulder was soaked and vivid . The spear had struck between the shoulder-joint and collarbone , tearing one of the great veins , so that it bled heavily . Under Sparrowhawk 's direction , Arren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandage the wound . Sparrowhawkasked him for the spear , and when Arren laid it on his knees he put his right hand over the blade , long and narrow Iike a willow leaf , of crudely hammered bronze ; he made as if to speak , but after a minute he shook his head . " I have no strength for spells , " he said . " Later . It will be all right . Can you get us out of this bay , Arren ? " Silently the boy returned to the oars . He bent his back to the work , and soon , for there was strength in his smooth , lithe frame , he brought Look f ar out of the crescent bay into open water . The long noon calm of the Reach lay on the sea . The sail hung slack . The sun glared through a veil of haze , and the green peaks seemed to shake and throb in the great heat . Sparrowhawk had stretched out in the bottom of the boat , his head propped against the thwart by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-parted . Arren did not like to look at his face , but stared over the boat 's stern . Heat-haze wavered above the water , as if veils of cobweb were spun out over the sky . His arms trembled with fatigue , but he rowed on . " Where are you taking us ? " Sparrowhawk asked hoarsely , sitting up a little . Turning , Arren saw the crescent bay curvingits green arms about the boat once more , the white linep120of the beach ahead , and the mountains gathered in the air above . He had turned the boat around without knowing it . " I ca n't row any more , " he said , stowing the oars and going to crouch in the prow . He kept thinking Sopli was behind him in the boat , by the mast . They had been many days together , and his death had been too sudden , too reasonless to be understood . Nothing was to be understood . The boat hung swaying on the water , the sail slack on the spar . The tide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly broadside to the current and pushed her by little nudges in and in , toward the distant white line of the beach . " Look far , " the mage said caressingly , and a word or two in the Old Speech ; and softly the boat rocked and nosed outwardand slipped over the blazing sea away from the arms of the bay . But as slowly and softly , in less than an hour , she ceased to make way , and again the sail hung slack . Arren looked back in the boat and saw his companion lying as before , but his head had dropped back a little , and his eyes were closed . All this while Arren had felt a heavy , sickly horror , which grew on him and held him from action as if winding his body and mind in fine threads . No courage rose up in him to fight against the fear ; only a kind of dull resentment against his lot . He should not let the boat drift here near the rocky shores of a land whose people attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not mean much . What was he to do instead ? Row the boat back to Roke ? He was lost , utterly lost beyond hope , in the vastness of the Reach . He could never bring the boat back through those weeks of voyage to any friendly land . Only with the mage 's guidance could he do it , and Sparrowhawk was hurt and helpless , as suddenly andp121meaninglessly as Sopli was dead . His face was changed , laxfeaturedand yellowish ; he might be dying . Arren thought that he should go move him under the awning to keep the sunlight off him , and give him water ; men who had lost blood needed to drink . But they had been short of water for days ; the barrel was almost empty . What did it matter ? There was no good in anything , no use . The luck had run out . Hours went by , the sun beat down , and the greyish heat wrapped Arren round . He sat unmoving . A breath of cool passed across his forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was down , the west dull red . Lookfarmoved slowly under a mild breeze from the east , skirting the steep , wooded shores of Obehol . Arren went back in the boat and looked after his companion , arranging him a pallet under the awning and giving him water to drink . He did these things hurriedly , keeping his eyes from the bandage , which was in need of changing , for the wound had not wholly ceased to bleed . Sparrowhawk , in the languor of weakness , did not speak ; even as he drank eagerly , his eyes closed and he slipped into sleep again , that being the greater thirst . He lay silent ; and when in the darknessthe breeze died , no magewind replaced it , and again the boat rocked idly on the smooth , heaving water . But now the mountains that loomed to the right were black against a sky gorgeous with stars , and for a long time Arren gazed at them . Their outlines seemed familiar to him , as if he had seen them before , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lay down to sleep he faced southward , and there , well up in the sky above the blank sea , burned the star Gordon . Beneath it were the two forming a triangle with it , and beneath these , three had risen in a straight line , forminga greater triangle . Then , slipping free of the liquid plains ofp122black and silver , two more followed as the night wore on ; they were yellow like Gobardon , though fainter , slanting from right to left from the right base of the triangle . So there were eight of the nine stars that were supposed to make the figure of a man , or the Hardic rune Agnen . To Arren 's eyes there was no man in the pattern , unless , as star-figures are , he was strangely distorted ; but the rune was plain , with hooked arm and cross-stroke , all but the foot , the last stroke to complete it , the star that had not yet risen . Watching for it , Arren slept . When he woke in the dawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid the shores and all but the peaks of the mountains , and thinned out into a haze above the violet waters of the south , dimming the last stars . He looked at his companion . Sparrowhawk breathed unevenly , as when pain moves under the surface of sleep not quite breaking it . His face was lined and old in the cold , shadowless light . Arren looking at him saw a man with no power left in him , no wizardry , no strength , not even youth , nothing . He had not saved Sopli , nor turned away the spear from himself . He had brought them into peril and had not saved them . Now Sopli was dead , and he dying , and Arren would die . Through this man 's fault ; and in vain , for nothing . So Arren looked at him with the clear eyes of despair and saw nothing . No memory stirred in him of the fountain under the rowan tree , or of the white magelight on the slave-ship in the fog , or of the weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any pride or stubbornness of will wake in him . He watched dawn come over the quiet sea , where low , great swells ran colored like pale amethyst , and it was all like a dream , pallid , with no grip or vigor of reality . And at the depths of the dreamp123and of the sea , there was nothing  --  a gap , a void . There were no depths . The boat moved forward irregularly and slowly , following the fitful humor of the wind . Behind , the peaks of Obehol shrank black against the rising sun , from which the wind came , bearing the boat away from land , away from the world , out onto the open sea.  |p124Toward  the middle of that day Sparrowhawk stirred and asked for water . When he had drunk he asked , " Where are we heading ? " For the sail was taut above him , and the boat dipped like a swallow on the long swells . " West , or north by west . " " I 'm cold , " Sparrowhawk said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arren said nothing.  | " Try to hold west . Wellogy , west of Obehol . Land there . We need water . " The boy looked forward , over the empty sea . " What 's the matter , Arren ? " He said nothing . Sparrowhawk tried to sit up , and failing that , to reach his staff that lay by the gear-box ; but it was out of his reach , and when he tried to speak again the words halted on his dry lips . The blood broke out anew under the soaked and crusted bandage , making a little spider 's thread of crimson on the dark skin of his chest . He drew breath sharply and closed his eyes . Arren looked at him , but without feeling , and not for long . I le went forward and resumed his crouching position in the prow , gazing forward . His mouth was very dry . The east rewind that now blew steady over the open sea was as dry as a desert wind . There were only two or three pints of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mind , for Sparrowhawk , not for himself ; it never occurred to him to drink from that water . He had set out fishing lines , having learned since they left Lorbanery that raw fish fulfills both thirst and hunger ; but there was never anything on the lines . It did not matter . The boat moved on over the desert of water . Over the boat , slowly , yet winning the race in the end by all the width of heaven , the sun moved also from east to west . Once Arren thought he saw a blue height in the south that might have been land or cloud ; the boat had been running somewhat north of west for hours . He did not try to tack and turn , but let her go on . The land might or might not be real ; it did not matter . To him all the vast , fiery glory of wind and light and ocean was dim and false . Darkness came , and light again , and dark , and light , like drumbeats on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water over the side of the boat . For an instant he saw that , vivid : his hand pale greenish- beneath the living water . He bent and sucked the wet off his fingers . It was bitter , burning his lips painfully , but he did it again . Then he was sick , and crouched down vomiting , but only a little bile burned his throat . There was no more water1 to give Sparrowhawk , and he was afraid to go near him . He lay down , shivering despite the heat . It was all silent , dry , and bright : terribly bright . He hid his eyes from the light . They stood in the boat , three of them , stalk-thin and angular , great-eyed , like strange dark herons or cranes . Their voices were thin , like birds ' voices . He did not understand them . One knelt above him with a dark bladder on his arm and tipped from it into Arren 's mouth : it was water . Arren drank avidly , choked , drank again till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and struggled to his feet , saying , " Where is , where is he ? " For in Look f ar with him were only the three strange , slender men . They looked at him uncomprehending . " The other man , " he croaked , his raw throat and stiffcakedlips unfit to form the words , " my friend  --  " One of them understood his distress if not his words , and putting a slight hand on his arm , pointed with the other . " There , " he said , reassuring . Arren looked . And he saw , ahead of the boat and northwardof her , some gathered in close and others strung far out across the sea , rafts : so many rafts that they lay like autumn leaves on a pool . Low to the water , each bore one or two cabins or huts near the center , and several had masts stepped . Like leaves they floated , rising and falling very softly as the vast swells of the western ocean passed under them.  |p127The  lanes of water shone like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and golden rainclouds , darkeningthe west . " There , " the man said , pointing to a great raft near Lookfar . " Alive ? " They all looked at him , and at last one understood . " Alive . He is alive . " At this Arren began to weep , a dry sobbing , and one of the men took his wrist in a strong and narrow hand and drew him out of Look far and onto a raft to which the boat had been made fast . The raft was so great and buoyant that it did not dip even slightly to their weight . The man led Arren across it , while one of the others reached out with a heavy gaff tipped with a curving whaleshark 's tooth and hauled a nearby raft closer , till they could step the gap . There he led Arren to the shelter or cabin , which was open on one side and closed with woven screens on the other three . " Lie down , " he said , and beyond that Arren knew nothing at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat , gazing up at a rough green roof dappled with tiny dots of light . He thought he was in the apple orchards of Semermine , where the princesof Enlad pass their summers , in the hills behind Berila ; he thought he was lying in the thick grass at Sernermine , looking up at the sunlight between apple boughs . After a while he heard the slap and jostle of water in the hollow places underneath the raft , and the thin voices of the raft-people speaking a tongue that was the common Hardic of the Archipelago , but much changed in sounds and rhythms , so that it was hard to understand ; and so he knew where he was  --  out beyond the Archipelago , beyond the Reach , beyond all isles , lost on the open sea . But still he was untroubled ,  |p128lying  as comfortably as if he lay in the grass in the orchards of his home . He thought after a while that he ought to get up , and did so , finding his body very thin and burnt-looking and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging that made the walls of the shelter and stepped out into the afternoon . It had rained while he slept . The wood of the raft , great , smooth-shapen , squared logs , fit close and caulked , was dark with wet , and the hair of the thin , half-naked people was black and lank from the rain . But half the sky was clear where the sun stood in the west , and the clouds now rode to the far northeast in heaps of silver . One of the men came up to Arren , warily , stopping some feet from him . He was slight and short , no taller than a boy of twelve ; his eyes were long , large , and dark . He carried a spear with a barbed ivory head . Arren said to him , " I owe my life to you and your people . " The man nodded . " Will you take me to my companion ? " Turning away , the raft-man raised his voice in a high , piercing cry like the call of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to wait , and Arren did the same . The rafts had masts , though the mast of the one they were on was not stepped . On these , sails could be run up , small compared to the breadth of the raft . The sails were of a brown material , not canvas or linen , but a fibrous stuff that looked not woven but beaten together , as felt is made . A raft some quarter mile away let the brown sail down from the crosstree by ropes and slowly worked its way , gaffing and poling off the other rafts between , till it came alongside the one Arren was on . When there was only three feet of water between , the man beside Arren got up and nonchalantly hopped across.  |p129Arren  did the same and landed awkwardly on all fours ; there was no spring left in his knees . He picked himself up and found the little man looking at him , not with amusement , but with approval : Arren 's composure had evidently won his respect . This raft was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made of logs forty feet in length and four or five feet wide , blackened and smooth with use and weather . Strangely carven statues of wood stood about the several shelters or enclosures on it , and tall poles bearing tufts of sea birds ' feathers stood at the four corners . His guide took him to the smallest of the shelters , and there he saw Sparrowhawk lying asleep . Arren sat down inside the shelter . His guide went back to the other raft , and nobody bothered him . After an hour or so a woman brought him food : a kind of cold fish stew with bits of some transparent green stuff in it , salty but good ; and a small cup of water , stale , tasting pitchy from the caulking of the barrel . He saw by the way she gave him the water that it was a treasure that she gave him , a thing to be honored . He drank it respectfully and asked for no more , though he could have drunk ten times the cupful . Sparrowhawk 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily . When he woke up , his eyes were clear . He looked at Arren and smiled the sweet , joyous smile that was always startling on his hard face . Arren felt suddenly Iike weeping again . He put his hand on Sparrowhawk 's hand and said nothing . One of the raft-folk approached and squatted down in the shade of the large shelter nearby : a kind of temple , it appeared to be , with a square design of great complexity above the doorway , and the doorjambs made of logs carved in thep130shape of grey whales sounding . This man was short and thin like the others , boy-like in frame , but his face was strongfeaturedand weathered by the years . He wore nothing but a loincloth , but dignity clothed him amply . " He must sleep , " he said , and Arren left Sparrowhawk and came to him . " You are the chief of this folk , " Arren said , knowing a prince when he saw one . " I am , " the man said , with a short nod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presently the man 's dark eyes met his briefly : " You are a chief also , " he observed . " I am , " Arren answered . He would have liked very much to know how the raftman knew it , but remained impassive . " But I serve my lord , there . " The chief of the raft-folk said something Arren did not understand at all : certain words changed out of recognition or names he did not know ; then he said , " Why came you into Balatran ? " " SeekingBut Arren did not know how much to say , nor indeed what to say . All that had happened , and the matter of their quest , seemed very long ago and was confused in his mind . At last he said , " We came to Obehol . They attacked us when we came to land . My lord was hurt . " " And you ? " " I was not hurt , " Arren said , and the cold self-possession he had learnt in his courtly childhood served him well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a madness . One who was with us drowned himself . There was a fear  --  " He stopped , and stood silent . The chief watched him with black , opaque eyes . At last he said , " You come by chance here , then . " " Yes . Are we still in the South Reach ? "  | " Reach ? No . The islands  --  " The chief moved his slender , black hand in an arc , no more than a quarter of the compass , north to east . " The islands are there , " he said . " All the islands . " Then showing all the evening sea before them , from north through west to south , he said , " The sea . " " What land are you from , lord ? " " No land . We are the Children of the Open Sea . " Arren looked at his keen face . He looked about him at the great raft with its temple and its tall idols , each carved from a single tree , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea bird ; at the people busy at their work , weaving , carving , fishing , cooking on raised platforms , tending babies ; at the other rafts , seventy at least , scattered out over the water in a great circle perhaps a mile across . It was a town : smoke rising in thin wisps from distant houses , the voices of children high on the wind . It was a town , and under its floors was the abyss . " Do you never come to land ? " the boy asked in a low voice . " Once each year . We go to the Long Dune . We cut wood there and refit the rafts . That is in autumn , and after that we follow the gray whales north . In winter we go apart , each raft alone . In the spring we come to Balatran and meet . There is going from raft to raft then , there are marriages , and the long Dance is held . These are the Roads of Balatran ; from here the great current bears south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we see the Great Ones , the grey whales , turning northward . Then we follow them , returning at last to the beaches of Emah on the Long Dune , for a little while . " This is most wonderful , my lord , " said Arren . " Never did I hear of such a people as yours . My home is very far from here . Yet there too , in the island of Enlad , we dance the Longp132Dance on midsummer eve . " " You stamp the earth down and make it safe , " the chief said dryly . " We dance on the deep sea . " After a time he asked , " How is he called , your lord ? " " Sparrowhawk , " Arren said . The chief repeated the syllables , but they clearly had no meaning for him . And that more than any other thing made Arren understand that the tale was true , that these people lived on the sea year in , year out , on the open sea past any land or scent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outside the knowledge of men . " There was death in him , " the chief said . " He must sleep . You go back to Star 's raft ; I will send for you . " He stood up . Though perfectly sure of himself , he was apparently not quite sure what Arren was ; whether he should treat him as an equal or as a boy . Arren preferred the latter , in this situation , and accepted his dismissal , but then faced a problem of his own . The rafts had drifted apart again , and a hundred yards of satiny water rippled between the two . The chief of the Children of the Open Sea spoke to himonce more , briefly . " Swim , " he said . Arren let himself gingerly into the water . Its cool was pleasant on his sun-baked skin . He swam across and hauled himself out on the other raft , to find a group of five or six children and young people watching him with undisguised interest . A very small girl said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How should I swim ? " asked Arren , a little mortified , butpolite ; not have been rude to ahuman being indeed he could so very small . She looked like a polished mahogany statuette , fragile , exquisite . " Like this ! " she cried , and dived like a seal into the dazzle and liquid roil of the waters . Only after a long time , and at an improbable distance , did he hear her shrillp133cry and see her black , sleek head above the surface . " Come on , " said a boy who was probably Arren 's age , though he looked not more than twelve in height and build : a grave-faced fellow , with a blue crab tattooed all across his hack . He dived , and all dived , even the three-year-old ; so Arren had to and did so , trying not to splash . " Like an eel , " said the boy , coming up by his shoulder . " Like a dolphin , " said a pretty girl with a pretty smile , and vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three-year-old , bobbing like a bottle . So that evening until dark , and all the next long golden day and the days that followed , Arren swam and talked and worked with the young people of Star 's raft . And of all the events of his voyage since that morning of the equinox when Ile and Sparrowhawk left Roke , this seemed to him in some way the strangest ; for it had nothing to do with all that had ; one before , in the voyage or in all his life ; and even less to do with what was yet to come . At night , lying down to sleep among the others under the stars , he thought , " It is as if I acre dead , and this is an after-life , here in the sunlight , beyond the edge of the world , among the sons and daughters of the sea .... " Before he slept he would look in the far south for the yellowstar and the figure of the Rune of Ending , and always he saw Gobardon and the lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he could not keep his eyes open till the whole figure stood free of the horizon . By night and by day the rafts drifted southward , but there was never any change itt the sea , for the ever-changing does not change ; the rainstormsof May passed over , and at night the stars shone , and all day the sun.  |p134He  knew that their life could not be lived always in this dreamlike ease . He asked of winter , and they told him of the long rains and the mighty swells , the single rafts , each separatedfrom all the rest , drifting and plunging along through the grey and darkness , week after week after week . Last winter in a month-long storm they had seen waves so great they were " like thunderclouds , " they said , for they had not seen hills . From the back of one wave the next could be seen , immense , miles away , rushing hugely toward them . Could the rafts ride such seas ? he asked , and they said yes , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roads of Balatranthere would be two rafts missing , or three , or six ... . They married very young . Bluecrab , the boy tattooed with his namesake , and the pretty girl Albatross were man and wife , though he was just seventeen and she two years younger ; there were many such marriages between the rafts . Many babies crept and toddled about the rafts , tied by long leashes to the four posts of the central shelter , all crawling into it in the heat of the day and sleeping in wriggling heaps . The older children tended the younger , and men and women shared in all the work . All took their turn at gathering the great , brown-leaved seaweeds , the nilgu of the Roads , fringed like fern and eighty or a hundred feet long . All worked togetherat pounding the nilgu into cloth and braiding the coarse fibers for ropes and nets ; at fishing and drying the fish and shaping whale-ivory into tools , and all the other tasks of the rafts . But there was always time for swimming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task must be finished . There were no hours : only whole days , whole nights . After a few such days and nights it seemed to Arren that he had lived on the raft for time uncountable , and Obehol was a dream , and behind that were fainter dreams , and in somep135other world he had lived on land and been a prince in Enlad . When he was summoned at last to the chief 's raft , Sparrowhawklooked at him a while and said , " You look like that Arren whom I saw in the Court of the Fountain : sleek as a golden seal . It suits you here , lad . " " Aye , my lord . " " But where is here ? We have left places behind us . We have sailed off the maps . . . . Long ago I heard tell of the Raft-Folk , but thought it only one more tale of the South Reach , a fancy without substance . Yet we were rescued by that fancy , and our lives saved by a myth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that timelessease of life in the summer light ; but his face was gaunt , and in his eyes lay an unlighted darkness . Arren saw that and faced it . " I betrayed  --  " he said , and stopped . " I betrayed your trust in me . " " How so , Arren ? " " There  --  at Obehol . When for once you needed me . You were hurt and needed my help . I did nothing . The boat drifted , and I let her drift . You were in pain , and I did nothing for you . I saw land  --  I saw land , and did not even try to turn the boat  --  " " Be still , lad , " the mage said with such firmness that Arren obeyed . And presently , " Tell me what you thought at that time . " " Nothing , my lord  --  nothing ! I thought there was no use in doing anything . I thought your wizardry was gone  --  no , that it had never been . That you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face and he had to force his voice , but he went on . " I was afraid of you . I was afraid of death . I was so afraid of it I would not look at you , because you might bep136dying . I could think of nothing , except that there was  --  there was a way of not dying for me , if I could find it . But all the time life was running out , as if there was a great wound and the blood running from it  --  such as you had . But this was in everything . And I did nothing , nothing , but try to hide from the horror of dying . " He stopped , for saying the truth aloud was unendurable . It was not shame that stopped him , but fear , the same fear . He knew now why this tranquil life in sea and sunlight on the rafts seemed to him like an after-life or a dream , unreal . It was because he knew in his heart that reality was empty : without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were no heights or depths . All this lovely play of form and light and color on the sea and in the eyes of men , was no more than that : a playing of illusions on the shallow void . They passed , and there remained the shapelessness and the cold . Nothing else . Sparrowhawk was looking at him , and he had looked down to avoid that gaze . But there spoke in Arren unexpectedlya little voice of courage or of mockery : it was arrogantand pitiless , and it said , " Coward ! Coward ! Will you throw even this away ? " So he looked up , with a great effort of his will , and met his companion 's eyes . Sparrowhawk reached out and took his hand in a hard grasp , so that both by eye and by flesh they touched . He said Arren 's true name , which he had never spoken : " Lebannen . " Again he said it : " Lebannen , this is . And thou art . There is no safety , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silence ; there must be darkness to see the stars . The dance is always danced above the hollow place , above the terrible abyss . "  |p137Arren  clenched his hands and bent his forehead down till it pressed against Sparrowhawk 's hand . " I failed you , " he said . " I will fail you again and fail myself . I have not strength enough ! " " You have strength enough . " The mage 's voice was tender , but beneath tenderness was that same hardness that had risen in the depths of Arren 's own shame , and mocked him . " What you love , you will love . What you undertake , you will complete . You are a fulfiller of hope ; you are to be reliedon . But seventeen years give little armor against despair . ... Consider , Arren . To refuse death is to refuse life . " " But I sought death  --  yours and mine ! " Arren lifted his head and stared at Sparrowhawk . " Like Sopli who drowned himself  --  " " Sopli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and from life . He sought safety : an end to fear  --  to the fear of death . " " But there is  --  there is a way . There is a way beyond death . Back to life . To life beyond death , life without death . That is  --  what they seek . Hare and Sopli , the ones who were wizards . That is what we seek . You  --  you above all must know  --  must know of that wayThe mage 's strong hand was still on his . " I do not , " Sparrowhawksaid . " Aye , I know what they think they seek . But I know it to be a lie . Listen to me , Arren . You will die . You will not live forever . Nor will any man nor any thing . Nothing is immortal . But only to us is it given to know that we must die . And that is a great gift : the gift of selfhood . For we have only what we know we must lose , what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is our torment , and our treasure , and our humanity , does not endure . It changes ; it is gone , a wave on the sea . Would you have the sea growp138still and the tides cease , to save one wave , to save yourself ? Would you give up the craft of your hands , and the passion of your heart , and the light of sunrise and sunset , to buy safety for yourself  --  safety forever ? That is what they seek to do on Wathort and Lorbanery and elsewhere . That is the message that those who know how to hear have heard : By denying life you may deny death and live forever !  --  And this message I do not hear , Arren , for I will not hear it . I will not take the counsel of despair . I am deaf ; I am blind . You are my guide . You in your innocence and your courage , in your unwisdom and your loyalty , you are my guide  --  the child I send before me into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I follow . You have thought me harsh to you , Arren ; you never knew how harsh . I use your love as a man burns a candle , burns it away , to light his steps . And we must go on . We must go on . We must go all the way . We must come to the place where the sea runs dry and joy runs out , the place to which your mortal terror draws you . " " Where is it , my lord ? " " I do not know . " " I can not lead you there . But I will come with you . " The mage 's gaze on him was somber , unfathomable . " But if I should fail again and betray you  --  " " I will trust you , son of Morred . " Then both were silent . Above them the tall , carven idols rocked very slightly against the blue southern sky : dolphin bodies , gulls ' wings folded , human faces with staring eyes of shell . Sparrowhawk got up stiffly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his wound . " I am tired of sitting about , " he said . " I shall grow fat in idleness . " He began to pace the length of the raft , and Arren joined him . They talked a littlep139as they walked ; Arren told Sparrowhawk how he spent his days , who his friends among the raft-folk were . **25;14055;TOOLONG was greater than his strength , which soon gave out . He stopped by a girl who was weaving nilgu on her loom behind the House of the Great Ones , asking her to seek out the chief for him , and then returned to his shelter . There the chief of the raft-folk came , greeting him with courtesy , which the mage returned ; and all three of them sat down together on the spotted sealskin rugs of the shelter . " I have thought , " the chief began , slowly and with a civil solemnity , " of the things you have told me . Of how men think to come back from death into their own bodies , and seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies and go mad . This is an evil matter and a great folly . Also I have thought , What has it to do with us ? We have nothing to do with other men , their islands and their ways , their makings and unmakings . We live on the sea and our lives are the sea 's . We do not hope to save them ; we do not seek to lose them . Madness does not come here . We do not come to land ; nor do the land-folk come to us . When I was young , we spoke sometimes with men who came on boats to the Long Dune , when we were there to cut the raftlogsand build the winter shelters . Often we saw sails from Ohol and Welwai ( so he called Obehol and Wellogy ) following the grey whales in the autumn . Often they followedour rafts from afar , for we know the roads and meeting places of the Great Ones in the sea . But that is all I ever saw of the land-folk , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad and fought with one another . Two years ago on the Long Dune looking north to Welwai we saw for three days the smoke of a great burning . And if that were so , what is it to us ? We are the Children of the Openp140Sea . We go the sea 's way . " " Yet seeing a landsman 's boat adrift you came to it , " said the mage . " Some among us said it was not wise to do so , and would have let the boat drift on to sea 's end , " the chief answered in his high , impassive voice . " You were not one of them . " " No . I said , though they be land-folk , yet we will help them , and so it was done . But with your undertakings we have nothing to do . If there is a madness among the landfolk , the land-folk must deal with it . We follow the road of the Great Ones . We can not help you in your search . So long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome . It is not many days till the Long Dance ; after it we return northward , followingthe eastern current that by summer 's end will bring us round again to the seas by the Long Dune . If you will stay with us and be healed of your hurt , this will be well . Or if you will take your boat and go your way , this too will be well . " The mage thanked him , and the chief got up , slight and stiff as a heron , and left them alone together . " In innocence there is no strength against evil , " said Sparrowhawk , a little wryly . " But there is strength in it for good . ... We shall stay with them a while , I think , till I am cured of this weakness . " " That is wise , " said Arren . Sparrowhawk 's physical frailty had shocked and moved him ; he had determined to protect the man from his own energy and urgency , to insist that they wait at least until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mage looked at him , somewhat startled by the compliment . " They are kind here , " Arren pursued , not noticing . " They seem to be free of that sickness of soul they had in Honp141Town and the other islands . Maybe there is no island where we would have been helped and welcomed , as these lost people have done . " " You may well be right . " " And they lead a pleasant life in summer .... " " They do . Though to eat cold fish one 's whole life long , and never to see a pear-tree in blossom or taste of a running spring , would be wearisome at last ! " So Arren returned to Star 's raft , worked and swam and basked with the other young people , talked with Sparrowhawkin the cool of the evening , and slept under the stars . And the days wore on toward the Long Dance of midsummer'seve , and the great rafts drifted slowly southward on the currents of the open sea.  |p142All  night long , the shortest night of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered in a great circle underthe thick-starred sky , so that a ring of fires flickered on the sea . The raft-folk danced , using no drum or flute or any music but the rhythm of bare feet on the great , rocking rafts , and the thin voices of their chanters ringing plaintive in the vastness of their dwelling place the sea . There was no moon that night , and the bodies of the dancers were dim in the star/light and torchlight . Now and again one flashed like a fish leaping , a youth vaulting from one raft to the next : long leaps and high , and they vied with one another , trying to circle all the ring of rafts and dance on each , and so come round before the break of day . Arren danced with them , for the Long Dance is held on every isle- of the Archipelago , though the steps and songs may vary . But as the night drew on , and many dancers dropped out and settled down to watch or doze , and the voices of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-leaping lads to the chief 's raft and there stopped , while they went on . Sparrowhawk sat with the chief and the chief 's three wives , near the temple . Between the carven whales that made its doorway sat a chanter whose high voice had not flagged all night long . Tireless he sang , tapping his hands on the wooden deck to keep the time . " What does he sing of ? " Arren asked the mage , for he could not follow the words , which were all held long , with trills and strange catches on the notes . " Of the grey whales and the albatross and the storm ... . They do not know the songs of the heroes and the kings . They do not know the name of Erreth-Akbe . Earlier he sang of Segoy , how he established the lands amid the sea ; that much they remember of the lore of men . But the rest is all of the sea . " Arren listened : he heard the singer imitate the whistling cry of the dolphin , weaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the tochlight , black and firm as rock , saw the liquid gleam of the chief 's wives ' eyes as they chatted softly , felt the long , slow dip of the raft on the quiet sea , and slipped gradually toward sleep.  |p144He  roused all at once : the chanter had fallen silent . Not only the one near whom they sat , but all the others , on the rafts near and far . The thin voices had died away like a faroffpiping of sea birds , and it was still . Arren looked over his shoulder to the east , expecting dawn . But only the old moon rode low , just rising , golden among the summer stars . Then looking southward he saw , high up , yellow Gobardon , and below it the eight companions , even to the last : the Rune of Ending clear and fiery above the sea . And turning to Sparrowhawk , he saw the dark face turned to those same stars . " Why do you cease ? " the chief was asking the singer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man stammered and said , " I do not know . " " Sing on ! The Long Dance is not ended . " " I do not know the words , " the chanter said , and his voice rose high as if in terror . " I can not sing . I have forgotten the song . " " Sing another , then ! " " There are no more songs . It is ended , " the chanter cried , and bent forward till he crouched on the decking ; and the chief stared at him in amazement . The rafts rocked beneath their sputtering torches , all silent . The silence of the ocean enclosed the small stir of life and light upon it and swallowed it . No dancer moved . It seemed to Arren then that the splendor of the stars dimmed , and yet no daylight was in the east . A horror came on him , and he thought , " There will be no sunrise . There will be no day . " The mage stood up . As he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along his staff , burning clearest in the rune thatp145was set in silver in the wood . " The dance is not ended , " he said , " nor the night . Arren , sing . " Arren would have said , " I can not , lord ! "  --  but instead he looked at the nine stars in the south , drew a deep breath , and sang . His voice was soft and husky at first , but it grew stronger as he sang , and the song was that oldest song , of the Creation of Ea , and the balancing of the dark and the light , and the making of green lands by him who spoke the first word , the Eldest Lord , Segoy . Before the song was ended , the sky had paled to greyishblue , and in it only the moon and Gobardon still burned faintly . The torches hissed in the wind of dawn . Then , the song done , Arren was silent ; and the dancers who had gatheredto listen returned quietly from raft to raft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good song , " the chief said . His voice was uncertain , though he strove to speak impassively . " It would not he well to end the Long Dance before it is completed . I will have the lazy chanters beaten with nilgu thongs . " " Comfort them , rather , " Sparrowhawk said . He was still afoot , and his tone was stern . " No singer chooses silence . Come with me , Arren . " He turned to go to the shelter , and Arren followed him . But the strangeness of that daybreak was not yet done , for even then , as the eastern rim of the sea grew white , there time from the north flying a great bird : so high up that its wings caught the sunlight that had not shone upon the world yet and beat in strokes of gold upon the air . Arren cried out , pointing . The mage looked up , startled . Then his face became fierce and exulting , and he shouted out aloud , " Nam hietha grtr Ged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Making is , If thou seekest Ged here find him.  |p146And  like a golden plummet dropped , with wings held high outstretched , vast and thundering on the air , with talons which might seize an ox as if it were a mouse , with a curl of steamy flame streaming from long nostrils , the dragon stooped like a falcon on the rocking raft . The raft-folk cried out ; some cowered down , some leapt into the sea , and some stood still , watching , in a wonder that surpassed fear . The dragon hovered above them . Ninety feet , maybe , was he from tip to tip of his vast membranous wings , that shone in the new sunlight like gold-shot smoke , and the length of his body was no less , but lean , arched like a greyhound , clawed like a lizard , and snake-scaled . Along the narrow spine went a row of jagged darts , like rose-thorns in shape , but at the hump of the back three feet in height , and so diminishing that the last at the tail-tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These thorns were grey , and the scales of the dragon were iron-grey , but there was a glitter of gold in them . His eyes were green and slitted . Moved by fear for his people to forget fear for himself , the chief of the raft-folk came from his shelter with a harpoonsuch as they used in the hunt of whales : it was longer than himself and pointed with a great , barbed point of ivory . Poising it on his small , sinewy arm , he ran forward to gain the impetus to hurl it up and strike the dragon 's narrow , light-mailed belly that hung above the raft . Arren waking from stupor saw him , and plunging forward caught his arm and came down in a heap with him and the harpoon . " Would you anger him with your silly pins ? " he gasped . " Let the Dragonlord speak first ! " The chief , half the wind knocked out of him , stared stupidlyat Arren and at the mage and at the dragon . But he didp147not say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ged to whom it spoke could understand it , for dragons speak only in the Old Speech , which is their tongue . The voice was soft and hissing , almost like a cat 's when he cries out softly in rage , but huge , and there was a terrible music in it . Whoever heard that voice stopped still and listened . The mage answered briefly , and again the dragon spoke , poising above him on slight-shifting wings : even , thought Arren , like a dragonfly poised on the air . Then the mage answered one word , " Memeas , " I will come ; and he lifted up his staff of yew-wood . The dragon 's jaws opened , and a coil of smoke escaped them in a long arabesque . The gold wings clapped like thunder , making a great wind that smelled of burning : and he wheeled and flew hugely to the north . It was quiet on the rafts , with a little thin piping and wailing of children , and women comforting them . Men climbed aboard out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first rays of the sun . The mage turned to Arren . His face had a light in it that might have been joy or stark anger , but he spoke quietly . " Now we must go , lad . Say your farewells and come . " He turned to thank the chief of the raft-folk and bid him farewell , and then went from the great raft across three others , for they still lay close ingathered for the dancing , till he came to the one to which Look far was tied . So the boat had followed the raft-town in its long , slow drift into the south , rocking along empty behind ; but the Children of the Open Sea had filled its empty cask with hoarded rainwater and made up its stock of provisions , wishing thus to honor their guests , for many of them believed Sparrowhawk to be one ofp148the Great Ones , who had taken on the form of a man instead of the form leapt into the boat , and in that instant she veered from the raft and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breeze of sunrise blew . She heeled turning and sped off northward on the dragon 's track , light as a blown leaf on the wind . When Arren looked back , he saw the raft-town as a tiny scattering , little sticks and chips of wood afloat : the shelters and the torch-poles . Soon these were lost in the dazzle of early sunlight on the water . Look far fled forward . When her bow bit the waves , fine crystal spray flew , and the wind of her going flung back Arren 's hair and made him squint . Under no wind of earth could that small boat have sailed so fast , unless in storm , and then it might have foundered in the storm-waves . This was no wind of earth , but the mage 's word and power , that sent her forth so fleet . He stood a long time by the mast , with watchful eyes . At last he sat down in his old place by the tiller , laying one hand upon it , and looked at Arren . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dragon of Selidor , kin to that great Orm who slew Erreth-Akbe and was slain by him . " " Was he hunting , lord ? " said Arren ; for he was not ' certainwhether the mage had spoken to the dragon in welcome or in threat . " Hunting me . What dragons hunt , they find . He came to ask my help . " He laughed shortly . " And that 's a thing I would not believe if any told me : that a dragon turned to a man for help . And of them all , that one ! He is not the oldest , though he is very old , but he is the mightiest of his kind . He does not hide his name , as dragons and men must do.  |p149He  has no fear that any can gain power over him . Nor does he deceive , in the way of his kind . Long ago , on Selidor , he let me live , and he told me a great truth ; he told me how the Rune of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ring of Erreth-Akbe . But never did I think to repay such a debt , to such a creditor ! " " What does he ask ? " " To show me the way I seek , " said the mage , more grimly . And after a pause , " He said , In the west there is another Dragonlord ; he works destruction on us , and his power is greater than ours . ' I said , Even than thine , Orm Embar ? ' and he said , Even than mine . I need thee : follow in haste . ' And so bid , I obeyed . " " You know no more than that ? " " I will know more . " Arren coiled up the mooring line , stowed it , and saw to other small matters about the boat , but all the while the tension of excitement sang in him like a tightened bowstring , and it sang in his voice when he spoke at last . " This is a better guide , " he said , " than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aye , " he said . This time we will not go astray , I think . " So those two began their great race across the ocean . A thousand miles and more it was from the uncharted seas of the raft-folk to the island Selidor , which lies of all the lands of Earthsea the farthest west . ' Day after day rose shining from the clear horizon and sank into the red west , and under the gold arch of the sun and the silver wheeling of the stars the boat ran northward , all alone on the sea . Sometimes the thunderclouds of high summer massed far off , casting purple shadows down on the horizon ; then Arren would watch the mage as he stood up and with voice andp150hand called those clouds to drift toward them and to loosen their rain down on the boat . The lightning would leap among the clouds , and the thunder would bellow . Still the mage stood with upraised hand , until the rain came pouring down on him and on Arren and into the vessels they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , flattening the waves with its violence . He and Arren would grin with pleasure , for of food they had enough , if none to spare , but water they needed . And the furious splendor of the storm that obeyed the mage 's word delighted them . Arren wondered at this power which his companion now used so lightly , and once he said , " When we began our voyage , you used to work no charms . " " The first lesson on Roke , and the last , is Do what is needful . And no more ! " " The lessons in between , then , must consist in learning what is needful . " " They do . One must consider the Balance . But when the Balance itself is broken  --  then one considers other things . Above all , haste . " " But how is it that all the wizards of the South  --  and elsewhereby now  --  even the chanters of the rafts  --  all have lost their art , but you keep yours ? " " Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And after some time he added , more cheerfully , " And if I am soon to lose it , I shall make the best of it while it lasts . " There was indeed a kind of light-heartedness in him now , a pure pleasure in his skill , which Arren , seeing him always so careful , had not guessed . The mind of the magician takes delight in tricks ; a mage is a trickster . Sparrowhawk 's disguisein Hort Town , which had so troubled Arren , had beenp151a game to him ; a very slight game , too , for one who could transform not just his face and voice at will , but his body and very being , becoming as he chose a fish , a dolphin , a hawk . And once he said , " Look , Arren : I 'll show you Gont , " and had him look at the surface of their water-cask , which he had opened , and which was full to the brim . Many simple sorcerers can cause an image to appear on the water-mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cloud-wreathed , rising from a grey sea . Then the image changed , and Arren saw plainly a cliff on that mountain isle . It was as if he were a bird , a gull or a falcon , hanging on the wind offshore and looking across the wind at that cliff that towered from the breakers for two thousand feet . On the high shelf of it was a little house . " That is Re Albi , " said Sparrowhawk , " and there lives my master Ogion , he who stilled the earthquake long ago . He tends his goats , and gathers herbs , and keeps his silence . I wonder if he still walks on the mountain ; he is very old now . But I would know , surely I would know , even now , if Ogion died .... " There was no certainty in his voice ; for a moment the image wavered , as if the cliff itself were falling . It cleared , and his voice cleared : " He used to go up into the forests alone in late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , when I was a brat in a mountain village , and gave me my name . And my life with it . " The image of the water-mirror now showed as if the watcher were a bird among the forest branches , looking out to steep , sunlit meadows beneath the rock and snow of the peak , looking inward along a steep road going down in a green , gold-shot darkness . " There is no silence like the silence of those forests , " Sparrowhawk said , yearning . The image faded , and there was nothing but the blinding disk of the noon sun reflected in the water in the cask.  | " There , " Sparrowhawk said , looking at Arren with a strange , mocking look , " there , if I could ever go back there , not even you could follow me . " Land lay ahead , low and blue in the afternoon like a bank of mist . " Is it Selidor ? " Arren asked , and his heart beat fast , but the mage answered , " Obb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half way yet , lad . " That night they sailed the straits between those two islands . They saw no lights , but there was a reek of smoke in the air , so heavy that their lungs grew raw with breathing it . When day came and they looked back , the eastern isle , Jessage , looked burnt and black as far as they could see inlandfrom the shore , and a haze hung blue and dull above it . " They have burnt the fields , " Arren said . " Aye . And the villages . I have smelled that smoke before . " " Are they savages , here in the West ? " Sparrowhawk shook his head . " Farmers ; townsmen . " Arren stared at the black ruin of the land , the withered trees of orchards against the sky ; and his face was hard . " What harm have the trees done them ? " he said . " Must they punish the grass for their own faults ? Men are savages , who would set a land afire because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have no guidance , " Sparrowhawk said . " No king ; and the kingly men and the wizardly men , all turned aside and drawn into their minds , are hunting the door through death . So it was in the South , and so I guess it to be here . " " And this is one man 's doing  --  the one the dragon spoke of ? It seems not possible . " " Why not ? If there were a King of the Isles , he would be one man . And he would rule . One man may as easily destroy ,  |p153as  govern : be King or Anti-King . " There was again that note in his voice of mockery or challengewhich roused Arren 's temper . " A king has servants , soldiers , messengers , lieutenants . He governs through his servants . Where are the servants of this  --  Anti-King ? " " In our minds , lad . In our minds . The traitor , the self ; the self that cries 1 want to live ; let the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traitor soul in us , in the dark , like the worm in the apple . He talks to all of us . But only some understand him . The wizards and the sorcerers . The singers ; the makers . And the heroes , the ones who seek to be themselves . To be one 's self is a rare thing and a great one . To be one 's self forever : is that not better still ? " Arren looked straight at Sparrowhawk . " You would say to me that it is not better . But tell me why . I was a child when I began this voyage , a child who did not believe in death . You think me a child still , but I have learnt something , not much , maybe , but something ; I have learnt that death exists and that I am to die . But I have not learnt to rejoice in the knowledge , to welcome my death or yours . IfI love life , shall I not hate the end of it ? Why should I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a man of about sixty , short and bald and cold . Arren had disliked him for years , though he knew him to be an extraordinary swordsman . But one day in practice he had caught his master off guard and nearly disarmed him , and he had never forgotten the incredulous , incongruous happiness that had suddenly gleamed in the master 's cold face , the hope , the joy  --  an equal , at last an equal ! From that moment on , the fencingmasterhad trained him mercilessly , and whenever theyp154fenced , that same relentless smile would be on the old man 's face , brightening as Arren pressed him harder . And it was on Sparrowhawk 's face now , the flash of steel in sunlight . " Why should you not desire immortality ? How should you not ? Every soul desires it , and its health is in the strength of its desire .  --  But be careful ; you are one who might achieve your desire . " " And then ? " " And then this : a false king ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the eye blind . This !  --  this blight and plague on the lands , this sore we seek to heal . There are two , Arren , two that make one : the world and the shadow , the light and the dark . The two poles of the Balance . Life rises out of death , death rises out of life ; in being opposite they yearn to each other , they give birth to each other and are forever reborn . And with them all is reborn , the flower of the apple tree , the light of the stars . In life is death . In death is rebirth . What then is life without death ? Life unchanging , everlasting , eternal ?  --  What is it but death  --  death without rebirth ? " " If so much hinges on it , then , my lord , if one man 's life might wreck the Balance of the Whole , surely it is not possible  --  itwould not be allowed  --  " He halted , confused . " Who allows ? Who forbids ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. But I know how much evil one man , one life , can do . I know it all too well . I know it because I have done it . I have done the same evil , in the same folly of pride . I opened the door between the worlds just a crack , just a little crack , just to show that I was stronger than death itself . . . . I was young and had not met death  --  like you . . . . It took the strength of the Archmage Nemmerle , it took his masteryp155and his life , to shut that door . You can see the mark that night left on me , on my face ; but him it killed . Oh , the door between the light and the darkness can be opened , Arren ; it takes strength , but it can be done . But to shut it again , there 's a different story . " " But my lord , what you speak of surely is different from this  --  " " Why ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel , of the falcon 's eye , was in Sparrowhawk 's look again . " What is a good man , Arren ? Is a good man one who would not do evil , who would not open a door to the darkness , who has no darkness in him ? Look again , lad . Look a little farther ; you will need what you learn , to go where you must go . Look into yourself ! Did you not hear a voice say Come ? Did you not follow ? " " I did . I  --  I have not forgotten . But I thought . . . . I thought that voice was . . . his . " " Aye , it was his . And it was yours . How could he speak to you , across the seas , but in your own voice ? How is it that 1w calls to those who know how to listen , the mages and the makers and the seekers , who heed the voice within them ? I low is it that he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen ; I will not hear that voice again . You were born to power , Arren , as I was ; power over men , over men 's souls ; and what is that but power over life and death ? You are young , you stand on the borders of possibility , on the shadowland , in the realm of dream , and you hear the voice saying Come . But I , who am old , who have done what I must do , who stand in the daylight facing my own death , the end of all possibility , I know that there is only one power that is real and worth the having . And that is the power , not to take , but to accept . "  |p156Jessage  was far behind them now , a blue smudge on the sea , a stain . " Then I am his servant , " Arren said . " You are . And I am yours . " " But who is he , then ? What is he ? " " A man , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you spoke of once  --  the wizard of Havnor , who summoned up the dead ? Is it he ? " " It may well be . He had great power , and it was all bent on denying death . And he knew the Great Spells of the Lore of Paln . I was young and a fool when I used that lore , and I brought ruin on myself . But if an old man and a strong one used it , careless of all consequence , he might bring ruin on us all . " " Were you not told that that man was dead ? " " Aye , " said Sparrowhawk , " I was . " And they said no more . That night the sea was full of fire . The sharp waves thrown back by Lookfar 's prow and the movement of every fish through the surface water were all outlined and alive with light . Arren sat with his arm on the gunwale and his head on his arm , watching those curves and whorls of silver radiance . He put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light ran softly from his fingers . " Look , " he said , " I too am a wizard . " " That gift you have not , " said his companion . " Much good I shall be to you without it , " said Arren , gazingat the restless shimmer of the waves , " when we meet our enemy . " For he had hoped  --  from the very beginning he had hoped  --  that the reason the Archmage had chosen him and him alone for this voyage was that he had some inborn power , descended from his ancestor Morred , which would in thep157ultimate need and the blackest hour be revealed : and so he would save himself and his lord and all the world from the enemy . But lately he had looked once more at that hope , and it was as if he saw it from a great distance ; it was like rememberingthat , when he was a very little boy , he had had a burning desire to try on his father 's crown , and had wept when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as childish . There was no magery in him . There never would be . The time might come , indeed , when he could , when he must , put on his father 's crown and rule as Prince of Enlad . But that seemed a small thing now , and his home a small place , and remote . There was no disloyalty in this . Only his loyalty had grown greater , being fixed upon a greater model and a broader hope . He had learned his own weakness also , and by it had learned to measure his strength ; and he knew that he was strong . But what use was strength if he had no gift , nothing to offer , still , to his lord but his service and his steady love ? Where they were going , would those be enough ? Sparrowhawk said only , " To see a candle 's light , one must take it into a dark place . " With that Arren tried to comfort himself ; but he did not find it very comforting . Next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water was grey . Over the mast the sky brightened to the blue of an opal , for the fog lay low . To Northern men such as Arrenof Enlad and Sparrowhawk of Gont , the fog was welcome , like an old friend . Softly it enclosed the boat so that they could not see far , and it was to them like being in a familiar morn after many weeks of bright and barren space and the wind blowing . They were coming back into their own climate , and were now perhaps at the latitude of Roke . Some seven hundred miles east of those fog-clad waters where Lookfar sailed , clear sunlight shone on the leaves ofp158the trees of the Immanent Grove , on the green crown of Roke Knoll , and on the high slate roofs of the Great House . In a room in the south tower , a magicians ' workroom clutteredwith retorts and alembics and great-bellied , crookneckedbottles , thick-walled furnaces and tiny heating-lamps , tongs , bellows , stands , pliers , pipes , a thousand boxes and vials and stoppered jugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such paraphernalia of alchemy , glass-blowing , metal-refining , and the arts of healing , in that room among the much-encumbered tables and benches stood the Master Changer and the Master Summoner of Roke . In his hands the grey-haired Changer held a great stone like a diamond uncarved . It was a rock-crystal , colored faintly deep within with amethyst and rose , but clear as water . Yet as the eye looked into that clarity , it found unclarity , and neither reflection nor image of what was real round about , but only planes and depths ever farther , ever deeper , until it was led quite into dream and found no way out . This was the Stone of Shelieth . It had long been kept by the princes of Way , sometimes as a mere bauble of their treasury , sometimes as a charm for sleep , sometimes for a more baneful purpose : for those who looked too long and without understandinginto that endless depth of crystal might go mad . The Archmage Gensher of Way , coming to Roke , had brought with him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mage it held the truth . Yet the truth varies with the man . Therefore the Changer , holding the stone and looking through its bossed , uneven surface into the infinite , pale-colored , shimmering depths , spoke aloud to tell what he saw . " I see the earth , even as though I stood on Mount Onn in the center of the world and beheld all beneath my feet , even top159the farthest isle of the farthest Reaches , and beyond . And all is clear . I see ships in the lanes of Ilien , and the hearthfires of Torheven , and the roofs of this tower where we stand now . But past Roke , nothing . In the south , no lands . In the west , no lands . I can not see Wathort where it should be , nor any isle of the West Reach , even so close as Pendor . And Osskil and Ebosskil , where are they ? There is a mist on Enlad , a greyness , like a spider 's web . Each time I look , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is empty and unbroken , even as it was before the Making  --  " and his voice stumbled on the last word as if it came with difficulty to his lips . He set the stone down on its ivory stand and stood away from it . His kindly face looked drawn . He said , " Tell me what you see . " The Master Summoner took up the crystal in his hands and turned it slowly as if seeking on its rough , glassy surface an entrance of vision . A long time he handled it , his face intent . At last he set it down and said , " Changer , I see little . Fragments , glimpses , making no whole . " The grey-haired Master clenched his hands . " Is that not strange in itself ? " " How so ? " " Are your eyes often blind ? " the Changer cried , as if enraged . " Do you not see that there is ... " and he stammered several times before he could speak , " Do you not see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a hand over my mouth ? " The Summoner said , You are overwrought , my lord . " " Summon the Presence of the Stone , " said the Changer , controlling himself , but speaking in a somewhat . stifled voice . " Why ? "  | " Why , because I ask you . " " Come , Changer , do you dare me  --  like boys before a bear 's den ? Are we children ? " " Yes ! Before what I see in the Stone of Shelieth , I am a child  --  a frightened child . Summon the Presence of the Stone . Must I beg you , my lord ? " " No , " said the tall Master , but he frowned , and turned from the older man . Then stretching wide his arms in the great gesture that begins the spells of his art , he raised his head and spoke the syllables of invocation . As he spoke , a light grew within the Stone of Shelieth . The room darkened about it ; shadows gathered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright , he brought his hands together , lifted the crystal before his face , and looked into its radiance . He was silent some while and then spoke . " I see the Fountainsof Shelieth , " he said softly . " The pools and basins and the waterfalls , the silver-curtained dripping caves where ferns grow in banks of moss , the rippled sands , the leaping up of the waters and the running of them , the outwelling of deep springs from earth , the mystery and sweetness of the source , the spring .... " He fell silent again , and stood so for a time , his face pale as silver in the light of the stone . Then he cried aloud wordlessly , and dropping the crystal with a crash , fell to his knees , his face hidden in his hands . There were no shadows . Summer sunlight filled the jumbledroom . The great stone lay beneath a table in the dust and litter , unharmed . The Summoner reached out blindly , catching at the other man 's hand , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got up , leaning a little on the Changer , and said with unsteadylips and some attempt to smile , " I will not take your dares again , my lord . "  | " What saw you , Thorion ? " " I saw the fountains . I saw them sink down , and the streams run dry , and the lips of the springs of water draw back . And underneath all was black and dry . You saw the sea before the Making , but I saw the . . . what comes after . . . I saw the Unmaking . " He wet his lips . " I wish that the Archmage were here , " he said . " I wish that we were there with him . " " Where ? There is none that can find him now . " The Summoner looked up at the windows that showed the blue , untroubled sky . " No sending can come to him , no summoningreach him . He is there where you saw an empty sea . He is coming to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our arts do not avail . . . . Yet maybe even now there are shells that might reach to him , some of those in the Lore of Paln . " " But those are spells whereby the dead are brought among the living . " " Some bring the living among the dead . " " You do not think him dead ? " " I think he goes toward death and is drawn toward it . And so are we all . Our power is going from us , and our strength , and our hope and luck . The springs are running dry . " The Changer gazed at him a while with a troubled face . " Do not seek to send to him , Thorion , " he said at last . " Me knew what he sought long before we knew it . To him the world is even as this Stone of Shelieth : he looks and sees what is and what must be . . . . We can not help him . The great spel Is have grown very perilous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you spoke . We must stand fast as he bade us and look to the walls of Roke and the rememberingof the Names . "  | " Aye , " said the Summoner . " But I must go and think on this . " And he left the tower room , walking somewhat stiffly and holding his noble , dark head high . In the morning the Changer sought him . Entering his room after vain knocking , he found him stretched asprawl on the stone floor , as if he had been hurled backward by a heavy blow . His arms were flung wide as if in the gesture of invocation , but his hands were cold , and his open eyes saw nothing . Though the Changer knelt by him and called him with a mage 's authority , saying his name , Thorion , thrice over , yet he lay still . He was not dead , but there was in him only so much life as kept his heart beating very slowly , and a little breath in his lungs . The Changer took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I forced you to look into the Stone . This is my doing ! " Then going hastily from the room he said aloud to those he met , Masters and students , " The enemy has reached among us , into Roke the well-defended , and has stricken our strength at its heart ! " Though he was a gentle man , he looked so fey and cold that those who saw him feared him . " Look to the Master Summoner , " he said . " Though who will summon back his spirit , since he the master of his art is gone ? " He went toward his own chamber , and they all drew back to let him pass . The Master Healer was sent for . He had them lay Thorion the Summoner abed and cover him warmly ; but he brewed no herb of healing , nor did he sing any of the chants that aid the sick body or the troubled mind . One of his pupils was with him , a young boy not yet made sorcerer , but promising in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Master , is there nothing to be done for him ? " " Not on this side of the wall , " said the Master Healer.  |p163Then  , recalling to whom he spoke , he said , " He is not ill , lad ; but even if this were a fever or illness of the body , I do not know if our craft would much avail . It seems there is no savor in my herbs of late ; and though I say the words of our spells , there is no virtue in them . " " That is like what the Master Chanter said yesterday . He stopped in the middle of a song he was teaching us , and said , ' I do not know what the song means . ' And he walked out of the room . Some of the boys laughed , but I felt as if the floor had sunk out from under me . " The Healer looked at the boy 's blunt , clever face , and then down at the Summoner 's face , cold and rigid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The songs will not be forgotten . " That night the Changer went from Roke . No one saw the manner of his going . He slept in a room with a window lookingout into a garden ; the window was open in the morning , and he was gone . They thought he had transformed himself with his own skill of form-change into a bird or beast , or a mist or wind even , for no shape or substance was beyond his art , and so had fled from Roke , perhaps to seek for the Archmage . Some , knowing how the shape-changer may be caught in his own spells if there is any failure of skill or will , feared for him , but they said nothing of their fears . So there were three of the Masters lost to the Council of the Wise . As the days passed and no news ever came of the Archmage , and the Summoner lay like one dead , and the Changer did not return , a chill and gloom grew in the Great House . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of leaving Roke , for they were not being taught what they had come to learn . " Maybe , " said one , " they were all lies from the beginning , these secret arts and powers . Of the Masters , only the Master Hand still does his tricks , andp164these , we all know , are frank illusion . And now the others hide or refuse to do anything , because their tricks have been revealed . " Another , listening , said , " Well , what is wizardry ? What is this art-magic , beyond a show of seeming ? Has it ever saved a man from death , or given long life , even ? Surely if the mages have the power they claim to have , they 'd all live forever ! " And he and the other boy fell to telling over the deaths of the great mages , how Morred had been killed in battle , and Nereger by the Grey Mage , and Erreth-Akbe by a dragon , and Gensher , the last Archmage , by mere sickness , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys listened gladly , having envious hearts ; others listened and were wretched . All this time the Master Patterner stayed alone in the Grove and let none enter it . But the Doorkeeper , though seldom seen , had not changed . He bore no shadow in his eyes . He smiled , and kept the doors of the Great House ready for its lord 's return.  |p165On  the seas of the outermost West Reach , that Lord of the Island of the Wise , waking cramped and stiff in a small boat in a cold , bright morning , sat up and yawned . And after a moment , pointing north , he said to his yawning companion , " ' Mere ! Two islands , do you see them ? The southmost of the isles of the Dragons ' Run . " " You have a hawk 's eyes , lord , " said Arren , peering through sleep over the sea and seeing nothing.  | " Therefore I am the Sparrowhawk , " the mage said ; he was still cheerful , seeming to shrug off forethought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I see gulls , " said Arren , after rubbing his eyes and searchingall the blue-grey horizon before the boat . The mage laughed . " Could even a hawk see gulls at twenty miles ' distance ? " As the sun brightened above the eastern mists , the tiny wheeling flecks in the air that Arren watched seemed to sparkle , like gold-dust shaken in water , or dust-motes in a sunbeam . And then Arren realized that they were dragons . As Lookfar approached the islands , Arren saw the dragons soaring and circling on the morning wind , and his heart leapt up with them with a joy , a joy of fulfillment , that was like pain . All the glory of mortality was in that flight . Their beauty was made up of terrible strength , utter wildness , and the grace of reason . For these were thinking creatures , with speech and ancient wisdom : in the patterns of their flight there was a fierce , willed concord . Arren did not speak , but he thought : I do not care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind of morning . At times the patterns jarred , and the circles broke , and often in flight one dragon or another would jet from its nostrilsa long streak of fire that curved and hung on the air a moment repeating the curve and brightness of the dragon 's long , arching body . Seeing that , the mage said , " They are angry . They dance their anger on the wind . " And presently he said , " Now we 're in the hornet 's nest . " For the dragons had seen the little sail on the waves , and first one , then another , broke from the whirlwind of their dancing and came stretched long and level on the air , rowing with great wings , straight toward the boat.  |p167The  mage looked at Arren , who sat at the tiller , since the waves ran rough and counter . The boy held it steady with a steady hand , though his eyes were on the beating of those wings . As if satisfied , Sparrowhawk turned again , and standing by the mast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted up his staff and spoke aloud . At the sound of his voice and the words of the Old Speech , some of the dragons wheeled in mid-flight , scattering , and returned to the isles . Others halted and hovered , the swordlikeclaws of their forearms outstretched but checked . One , dropping low over the water , flew slowly on toward them : in two wing-strokes it was over the boat . The mailed belly scarcely cleared the mast . Arren saw the wrinkled , unarmoredflesh between the inner shoulder-joint and breast , which , with the eye , is the dragon 's only vulnerable part , unless the spear that strikes is mightily enchanted . The smoke that roiled from the long , toothed mouth choked him , and with it came a carrion stench that made him wince and retch . The shadow passed . It returned , as low as before , and this time Arren felt the furnace-blast of breath before the smoke . He heard Sparrowhawk 's voice , clear and fierce . The dragon passed over . Then all were gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gust of wind . Arren caught his breath and wiped his forehead , which was covered with cold sweat . Looking at his companion , he saw his hair gone white : the dragon 's breath had burnt and crisped the ends of the hairs . And the heavy cloth of the sail was scorched brown along one side . Your head is somewhat singed , lad . " " So is yours , lord . " Sparrowhawk passed his hand over his hair , surprised . " Sop168it is !  --  That was an insolence ; but I seek no quarrel with these creatures . They seem mad or bewildered . They did not speak . Never have I met a dragon who did not speak before it struck , if only to torment its prey . . . . Now we must go forward . Do not look them in the eye , Arren . Turn aside your face if you must . We 'll go with the world 's wind ; it blows fair from the south , and I may need my art for other things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and soon had on her left a distant island and on her right the twin isles they had seen first . These rose up into low cliffs , and all the stark rock was whitened with the droppings of the dragons and of the little , blackheadedterns that nested fearlessly among them . The dragons had flown up high , and circled in the upper air as vultures circle . Not one stooped down again to the boat . Sometimes they cried out to one another , high and harsh across the gulfs of air , but if there were words in their crying , Arren could not make them out . The boat rounded a short promontory , and he saw on the shore what he took for a moment to be a ruined fortress . It was a dragon . One black wing was bent under it and the other stretched out vast across the sand and into the water , so that the come and go of waves moved it a little to and fro in a mockery of flight . The long snake-body lay full length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the armor and flesh were torn from the great arch of the ribs , and the belly was torn open , so that the sand for yards about was blackened with the poisoned dragon-blood . Yet the creature still lived . So great a life is in dragons that only an equal power of wizardry can kill them swiftly . The green-gold eyes were open , and as the boat sailed by , the lean , huge head moved a little , and with a rattling hiss steam mixed withp169bloody spray shot from the nostrils . The beach between the dying dragon and the sea 's edge was tracked and scored by the feet and heavy bodies of his kind , and his entrails were trodden into the sand . Neither Arren nor Sparrowhawk spoke until they were well clear of that island and heading across the choppy , restless channel of the Dragons ' Run , full of reefs and pinnaclesand shapes of rock , toward the northern islands of the double chain . Then Sparrowhawk said , " That was an evil sight , " and his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own kind ? " No . No more than we do . They have been driven mad . Their speech has been taken from them . They who spoke before men spoke , they who are older than any living thing , the Children of Segoy  --  they have been driven to the dumb terror of the beasts . Ah ! Kalessin ! where have your wings home you ? Have you lived to see your race learn shame ? " I I is voice rang like struck iron , and he looked upward , searchingthe sky . But the dragons were behind , circling lower now ; shove the rocky isles and the blood-stained beach , and overheadwas nothing but the blue sky and the sun of noon . There was then no man living who had sailed the Dragons ' H un or seen it , except the Archmage . Twenty years before . and more , he had sailed the length of it from east to west and back again . It was a nightmare and a marvel , to a sailor . The water was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , by hand and word and most vigilant care , he and Arren now picked their boat 's way , between the rocks and reefs . Some of these lay low , under or half-under the wash of the waves , covered with anemone and barnacle and ribhony sea fern ; like water-monsters , shelled or sinuous . Others stood up in cliff and pinnacle sheer from the sea , andp170these were arches and half-arches , carven towers , fantastic shapes of animals , boar 's backs and serpent 's heads , all huge , deformed , diffuse , as if life writhed half-conscious in the rock . The sea-waves beat on them with a sound like breathing , and they were wet with the bright , bitter spray . In one such rock from the south there was plainly visible the hunched shoulders and heavy , noble head of a man , stooped in pondering thought above the sea ; but when the boat had passed it , looking back from the north , all man was gone from it , and the massive rocks revealed a cave in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapping thunder . There seemed to be a word , a syllable , in that sound . As they sailed on , the garbling echoes lessened and this syllable came more clearly , so that Arren said , " Is there a voice in the cave ? " " The sea 's voice . " " But it speaks a word . " Sparrowhawk listened ; he glanced at Arren and back at the cave . " How do you hear it ? " " As saying the sound ahm . " " In the Old Speech that signifies the beginning , or long ago . But I hear it as ohb , which is a way of saying the end .  --  Look ahead there ! " he ended abruptly , even as Arren warned him , " Shoal water ! " And , though Look f ar picked her way like a cat among the dangers , they were busy with the steeringfor some while , and slowly the cave forever thundering out its enigmatic word fell behind them . Now the water deepened , and they came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them loomed an island like a tower . Its cliffs were black and made up of many cylinders or great pillars pressed together , with straight edges and plane surfaces , rising three hundred feet sheer from the water.  | " That is the Keep of Kalessin , " said the mage . " So the dragons named it to me , when I was here long ago . " " Who is Kalessin ? " " The eldest .... " " Did he build this place ? " " I do not know . I do n't know if it was built . Nor how old he is . I say he , ' but I do not even know that . . . . To Kalessin , Orm Embar is like a yearling kid . And you and I are like mayflies . " He scanned the terrific palisades , and Arren looked up at them uneasily , thinking how a dragon might drop from that far , black rim and be upon them almost with its shadow . But no dragon came . They passed slowly through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but the whisper and clap of shadowed waves on the columns of basalt . The water here was deep , without reef or rock ; Arren handled the boat , and Sparrowhawk stood up in the prow , searching the cliffs and the bright sky ahead . The boat passed out at last from the shadow of the Keep of Kalessin into the sunlight of late afternoon . They were across the Dragons ' Run . The mage lifted his head , like one who sees what he had looked to see , and across that great space of gold before them came on golden wings the dragon Orm Embar . Arren heard Sparrowhawk 's cry to him : Aro Kalessin ? He guessed the meaning of that , but could make no sense of what the dragon answered . Yet hearing the Old Speech he felt always that he was on the point of understanding , almost understanding : as if it were a language he had forgotten , not one he had never known . In speaking it the mage 's voice was much clearer than when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence about it , as does the softest touch on a great bell . But the dragon 's voice was like ap172gong , both deep and shrill , or the hissing thrum of cymbals . Arren watched his companion stand there in the narrow prow , speaking with the monstrous creature that hovered above him filling half the sky ; and a kind of rejoicing pride came into the boy 's heart , to see how small a thing a man is , how frail and how terrible . For the dragon could have torn the man 's head from his shoulders with one stroke of his taloned foot , he could have crushed and sunk the boat as a stone sinks a floating leaf , if it were only size that mattered . But Sparrowhawk was as dangerous as Orm Embar , and the dragon knew it . The mage turned his head . " Lebannen , " he said , and the boy got up and came forward , though he wanted to go not one step closer to those fifteen-foot jaws and the long , slitpupilled , yellow-green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing to him , but put a hand on his shoulder , and spoke again to the dragon , briefly . " Lebannen , " said the vast voice with no passion in it . " Agni Lebannen ! " He looked up ; the pressure of the mage 's hand reminded him , and he avoided the gaze of the green-gold eyes . He could not speak the Old Speech , but he was not dumb . " I greet thee , Orm Embar , Lord Dragon , " he said clearly , as one prince greets another . Then there was a silence , and Arren 's heart beat hard and labored . But Sparrowhawk , standing by him , smiled . After that the dragon spoke again , and Sparrowhawk replied ; and this seemed long to Arren . At last it was over , suddenly . The dragon sprang aloft with a wingbeat that all but heeled the boat over , and was off . Arren looked at the sun and found it seemed no nearer setting than before ; the time hadp173not really been long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet ashes , and his eyes glittered as he turned to Arren . He sat down on the thwart . " Well done , lad , " he said hoarsely , " It is not easy  --  talking to dragons . " Arren got them food , for they had not eaten all day ; and the mage said no more until they had eaten and drunk . By then the sun was low to the horizon , though in these northernlatitudes , and not long past midsummer , night came late and slowly . " Well , " he said at last , " Orm Embar has , after his fashion , told me much . He says that the one we seek is and is not on Selidor . . . . It is hard for a dragon to speak plainly . They do not have plain minds . And even when one of them would speak the truth to a man , which is seldom , he does not know how truth looks to a man . So I asked him , Even as thy father Orm is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ErrethAkbedied in their battle . And he answered , ' No and yes . You will find him on Selidor , but not on Selidor . ' " Sparrowhawkpaused and pondered , chewing on a crust of hard bread . " Maybe he meant that though the man is not on Selidor , yet I must go there to get to him . Maybe ... . " I asked him then of the other dragons . He said that this man has been among them , having no fear of them , for though killed he returns from death in his body , alive . Thereforethey fear him as a creature outside nature . Their fear gives his wizardry hold over them , and he takes the Speech of the Making from them , leaving them prey to their own wild nature . So they devour one another or take their own lives , plunging into the sea  --  a loathly death for the fireserpent , the beast of wind and fire . Then I said , Where is thy lord Kalessin ? ' and all he would answer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalessin has flown away to the other lands , which dragons say lie farther than ever ship has sailed ; or it may not mean that . " So then I ceased my questions , and he asked his , saying , ' I flew over Kaltuel returning north , and over the Toringates . On Kaltuel I saw villagers killing a baby on an altar stone , and on Ingat I saw a sorcerer killed by his towns folk throwingstones at him . Will they eat the baby , think you , Ged ? Will the sorcerer come back from death and throw stones at his towns folk ? ' I thought he mocked me and was about to speak in anger , but he was not mocking . He said , The sense has gone out of things . There is a hole in the world and the sea is running out of it . The light is running out . We will be left in the dry land . There will be no more speaking and no more dying . ' So at last I saw what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and moreover was sorely troubled . For Sparrowhawk , in repeating the dragon 's words , had named himself by his own true name , unmistakably . This brought unwelcome into Arren 's mind the memory of that tormented woman of Lorbanery crying out , " My name is Akaren ! " If the powers of wizardry , and of music , and speech , and trust , were weakening and withering among men , if an insanity of fear was coming on them so that , like the dragons bereft of reason , they turned on each other to destroy : if all this were so , would his lord escape it ? Was he so strong ? He did not look strong , sitting hunched over his supper of bread and smoked fish , with hair greyed and fire-singed , and slight hands , and a tired face . Yet the dragon feared him . " What irks you , lad ? " Only the truth would do , with him.  | " My lord , you spoke your name . " " Oh , aye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need my true name , if we go where we must go . " He looked up , chewing , at Arren . " Did you think I grew senile and went about babbling my name , like old bleared men past sense and shame ? Not yet , lad ! " " No , " said Arren , so confused that he could say nothing else . He was very weary ; the day had been long , and full of dragons . And the way ahead grew dark . " Arren , " said the mage.  --  " No ; Lebannen : where we go , there is no hiding . There all bear their own true names . " " The dead can not be hurt , " said Arren somberly . " But it is not only there , not in death only , that men take their names . Those who can be most hurt , the most vulnerable : those who have given love and do not take it back , they speak each other 's names . The faithful-hearted , the givers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad . Lie down and sleep . There 's nothing to do now but keep the course all night . And by morning we shall see the last island of the world . " In his voice was an insuperable gentleness . Arren curled up in the prow , and sleep began to come into him at once . He heard the mage begin a soft , almost whispering chant , not in the Hardic tongue but in the words of the Making ; and as he began to understand at last and to remember what the words meant , just before he understood them , he fell fast asleep . Silently the mage stowed away their bread and meat , looked to the lines , made all trim in the boat , and then , takingthe guide-line of the sail in hand and sitting down on the after-thwart , he set the magewind strong in the sail . Tireless , Lookfar sped north , an arrow over the sea . He looked down at Arren . The boy 's sleeping face was litp176red-gold by the long sunset , the rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of the boy who had sat by the fountain of the Great House a few months since was gone ; this was a thinner face , harder , and much stronger . But it was not less beautiful . " I have found none to follow in my way , " Ged the Archmagesaid aloud to the sleeping boy or to the empty wind . " None but thee . And thou must go thy way , not mine . Yet will thy kingship be , in part , my own . For I knew thee first . I knew thee first ! They will praise me more for that in afterdaysthan for any thing I did of magery . . . . If there will be after-days . For first we two must stand upon the balancepoint , the very fulcrum of the world . And if I fall , you fall , and all the rest . . . . For a while , for a while . No darkness lasts forever . And even there , there are stars . . . . Oh , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunlight shining on the Tower of the Sword and on the Ring we brought for thee from Atuan , from the dark tombs , Tenar and I , before ever thou wast born ! " He laughed then , and turning to face the north , he said to himself in the common tongue , " A goatherd to set the heir of Morred on his throne ! Will I never learn ? " Presently , as he sat with the guide-rope in his hand and watched the full sail strain reddened in the last light of the west , he spoke again softly . " Not in Havnor would I be and not in Roke . It is time to be done with power . To drop the old toys and go on . It is time that I went home . I would see Tenar . I would see Ogion and speak with him before he dies , in the house on the cliffs of Re Albi . I crave to walk on the mountain , the mountain of Gont , in the forests , in the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the forests . It is time I went there , went in silence , wentp177alone . And maybe there I would learn at last what no act or art or power can teach me , what I have never learned . " The whole west blazed up in a fury and glory of red , so that the sea was crimson and the sail above it bright as blood ; and then the night came quietly on . All that night long the boy slept and the man waked , gazing forward steadily into the dark . There were no stars.  |p178Waking  in the morning Arren saw before the boat , dim and low along the blue west , the shores of Selidor . In the Hall in Berila were old maps that had been made in the days of the Kings , when traders and explorers had sailed from the Inner Lands and the Reaches had been better known . A great map of the North and West was laid in mosaic on two walls of the Prince 's throne-room , with the isle of Enlad in gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eye as he had seen it a thousand times in boyhood . North of Enlad was Osskil , and west of it Ebosskil , and south of that Semel and Paln . There the Inner Lands ended , and there was nothing but the pale blue-green mosaic of the empty sea , set here and there with a tiny dolphin or a whale . Then at last , after the corner where the north wall met the west wall , there was Narveduen , and beyond it three lesser islands . And then the empty sea again , on and on ; until the very edge of the wall and the end of the map , and there was Selidor , and beyond it , nothing . He could recall it vividly , the curving shape of it , with a great bay in the heart of it , opening narrowly to the east . They had not come so far north as that , but were steering now for a deep cove in the southernmost cape of the island , and there , while the sun was still low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So ended their great run from the Roads of Balatran to the Western Isle . The stillness of the earth was strange to them when they had beached Look f ar and walked after so long on solid ground . Ged climbed a low dune , grass-crowned , the crest of it leaning out over the steep slope , bound into cornices by the tough roots of the grass . When he reached the summit he stood still , looking west and north . Arren stopped at the boat to put on his shoes , which he had not worn for many days , and he took his sword out of the gear-box and buckled it on , this time with no questions in his mind as to whether or not he should do so . Then he climbed up beside Ged to look at the land . The dunes ran inland , low and grassy , for half a mile or so , and then there were lagoons , thick with sedge and saltreeds , and beyond those , low hills lay yellow-brown andp180empty to the end of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there any mark of man , his work or habitation . There were no beasts to be seen , and the reed-filled lakes bore no flocks of gulls or wild geese or any bird . They descended the inland side of the dune , and the slope of sand cut off the noise of the breakers and the sound of the wind , so that it became still . Between the outmost dune and the next was a dell of clean sand , sheltered , the morning sun shining warm on its western slope . " Lebannen , " the mage said , for he used Arren'strue name now , " I could not sleep last night , and now I must . Stay with me and keep watch . " He lay down in the sunlight , for the shade was cold ; put his arm over his eyes ; sighed , and slept . Arren sat down beside him . He could see nothing but the white slopes of the dell , and the dune-grass bowing at the top against the misty blue of the sky , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muted murmur of the surf , and sometimes the wind gusting moved the particlesof sand a little with a faint whispering . Arren saw what might have been an eagle flying very high , but it was not an eagle . It circled and stooped , and down it came with that thunder and shrill whistle of outspreadgolden wings . It alighted on huge talons on the summitof the dune . Against the sun the great head was black , with fiery glints . The dragon crawled a little way down the slope and spoke . " Agni Lebannen , " it said . Standing between it and Ged , Arren answered : " Orm Embar . " And he held his bare sword in his hand . It did not feel heavy now . The smooth , worn hilt was comfortable in his hand ; it fitted . The blade had come lightly , eagerly , from the sheath . The power of it , the age of it , werep181on his side , for he knew now what use to make of it . It was his sword . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He glanced back at his sleeping companion , whom all the rush and thunder had not awakened , and said to the dragon , " My lord is weary ; he sleeps . " At that Orm Embar crawled and coiled on down to the bottom of the dell . He was heavy on the ground , not lithe and free as when he flew , but there was a sinister grace in the slow placing of his great , taloned feet and the curving of his thorny tail . Once there he drew his legs beneath him , lifted up his huge head , and was still : like a dragon carved on a warrior 's helm . Arren was aware of his yellow eye , not ten feet away , and of the faint reek of burning that hung about him . This was no carrion stink ; dry and metallic , it accorded with the faint odors of the sea and the salt sand , a clean , wild smell . The sun rising higher struck the flanks of Orm Embar , and he burnt like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relaxed , taking no more notice of the dragon than a sleeping farmer of his hound . So an hour passed , and Arren , starting , found the mage had sat up beside him . " Have you got so used to dragons that you fall asleep between their paws ? " said Ged , and laughed , yawning . Then , rising , he spoke to Orm Embar in the dragons ' speech . Before Orm Embar answered , he too yawned  --  perhaps in sleepiness , perhaps in rivalry  --  and that was a sight that few have lived to remember : the rows of yellow-white teeth as long and sharp as swords , the forked , red , fiery tongue twice the length of a man 's body , the fuming cavern of the throat . Orm Embar spoke , and Ged was about to answer , whenp182both turned to look at Arren . They had heard , clear in the silence , the hollow whisper of steel on sheath . Arren was looking up at the lip of the dune behind the mage 's head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , bright lit by sunlight , the faint wind stirring his garments slightly , a man . He stood still as a carven figure except for that flutter of the hem and hood of his light cloak . His hair was long and black , falling in a mass of glossy curls ; he was broad-shouldered and tall , a strong , comely man . His eyes seemed to look out over them , at the sea . He smiled . " Orm Embar I know , " he said . " And you also I know , though you have grown old since I last saw you , Sparrowhawk . You are Archmage now , they tell me . You have grown great , as well as old . And you have a young servant with you : a prentice mage , no doubt , one of those who learn wisdom on the Isle of the Wise . What do you two here , so far from Roke and the invulnerable walls that protect the Masters from all harm ? " " There is a breach in greater walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his staff and looking up at the man . " But will you not come to us in the flesh , so that we may greet one whom we have long sought ? " " In the flesh ? " said the man , and smiled again . " Is mere flesh , body , butcher 's meat , of such account between two mages ? No , let us meet mind to mind , Archmage . " " That , I think , we can not do . Lad , put up your sword . It is but a sending , an appearance , no true man . As well draw blade against the wind . In Havnor , when your hair was white , you were called Cob . But that was only a use-name . How shall we call you when we meet you ? " " You will call me Lord , " said the tall figure on the dune 's edge.  | " Aye , and what else ? " " King and Master . " At that Orm Embar hissed , a loud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned his head away from the man , and sank crouching in his tracks , as if he could not move . " And where shall we come to you and when ? " " In my domain and at my pleasure . " " Very well , " said Ged , and lifting up his staff moved it a little toward the tall man  --  and the man was gone , like a candle-flame blown out . Arren stared , and the dragon rose up mightily on his four crooked legs , his mail clanking and the lips writhing back from his teeth . But the mage leaned on his staff again . " It was only a sending . A presentment or image of the man . It can speak and hear , but there 's no power in it , save what our fear may lend it . Nor is it even true in seeming , unless the sender so wishes . We have not seen what he now looks like , I guess . " " Is he near , do you think ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Selidor is a great island : broader than Roke or Gont and near as long as Enlad . We may seek him long . " Then the dragon spoke . Ged listened and turned to Arren . " Thus says the Lord of Selidor : I have come back to my own land , nor will I leave it . I will find the Unmaker and bring you to him , that together we may abolish him . ' And have I not said that what a dragon hunts , he finds ? " Thereupon Ged went down on one knee before the great creature , as a liegeman kneels before a king , and thanked him in his own tongue . The breath of the dragon , so close , was hot on his bowed head . Orm Embar dragged his scaly weight up the dune oncep184more , beat his wings , and took the air . Ged brushed the sand from his clothes and said to Arren , " Now you have seen me kneel . And maybe you 'll see me kneel once more , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant ; in their long companionshiphe had learned that there was reason in the mage 's reserve . Yet it seemed to him that there was evil omen in the words . They crossed over the dune to the beach once more to make sure the boat lay high above the reach of tide or storm , and to take from her cloaks for the night and what food they had left . Ged paused a minute by the slender prow which had borne him over strange seas so long , so far ; he laid his hand on it , but he set no spell and said no word . Then they struck inland , northward , once again , toward the hills . They walked all day , and at evening camped by a stream that wound down toward the reed-choked lakes and marshes . Though it was full summer the wind blew chill , coming from the west , from the endless , landless reaches of the open sea . A mist veiled the sky , and no stars shone above the hills on which no hearth-fire or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their small fire was dead , but a westering moon lit the land with a grey , misty light . In the stream-valley and on the hillside about it stood a great multitude of people , all still , all silent , their faces turned toward Ged and Arren . Their eyes caught no light of the moon . Arren dared not speak , but he put his hand on Ged 's arm . The mage stirred and sat up , saying , " What 's the matter ? " He followed Arren 's gaze and saw the silent people . They were all clothed darkly , men and women alike . Their faces could not be clearly seen in the faint light , but it seemedp185to Arren that among those who stood nearest them in the valley , across the little stream , there were some whom he knew , though he could not say their names . Ged stood up , the cloak falling from him . His face and hair and shirt shone silvery pale , as if the moonlight gathereditself to him . He held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 0 you who have lived , go free ! I break the bond that holds you : Anvassa mane hare , pennodathe ! " For a moment they stood still , the multitude of silent people . They turned away slowly , seeming to walk into the grey darkness , and were gone . Ged sat down . He drew a deep breath . He looked at Arren and put his hand on the boy 's shoulder , and his touch was warm and firm . " There 's nothing to fear , Lebannen , " he said gently , mockingly . " They were only the dead . " Arren nodded , though his teeth were chattering and he felt cold to his very bones . " How did , " he began , but his jaw and lips would not obey him yet . Ged understood him . " They came at his summoning . This is what he promises : eternal life . At his word they may return . At his bidding they must walk upon the hills of life , though they can not stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he then dead too ? " Ged shook his head , brooding . " The dead can not summon the dead back into the world . No , he has the powers of a living man ; and more . . . . But if any thought to follow him , he tricked them . He keeps his power for himself . He plays King of the Dead ; and not only of the dead . . . . But they were only shadows . " " I do n't know why I fear them , " Arren said with shame . " You fear them because you fear death , and rightly : for death is terrible and must be feared , " the mage said . He laidp186new wood on the fire and blew on the small coals under the ashes . A little flare of brightness bloomed on the twigs of brushwood , a grateful light to Arren . " And life also is a terrible thing , " Ged said , " and must be feared and praised . " They both sat back , wrapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . Then Ged spoke very gravely . " Lebannen , how long he may tease us here with sendings and with shadows , I do not know . But you know where he will go at last . " " Into the dark land . " " Aye . Among them . " " I have seen them now . I will go with you . " " Is it faith in me that moves you ? You may trust my love , but do not trust my strength . For I think I have met my match . " " I will go with you . " " But if I am defeated , if my power or my life is spent , I can not guide you back ; you can not return alone . " " I will return with you . " At that Ged said , " You enter your manhood at the gate of death . " And then he said that word or name by which the dragon had twice called Arren , speaking it very low : " Agni  --  Agni Lebannen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently sleep came back into them , and they lay down by their small and briefly burning fire . The next morning they walked on , going north and west ; this was Arren 's decision , not Ged 's , who said , " Choose us our way , lad ; the ways are all alike to me . " They made no haste , for they had no goal , waiting for some sign from Orm Embar . They followed the lowest , outmost range of hills , mostly within sight of the ocean . The grass was dry and short ,  |p187blowing  and blowing forever in the wind . The hills rose up golden and forlorn upon their right , and on their left lay the salt marshes and the western sea . Once they saw swans flying , far away in the south . No other breathing creature did they see all that day . A kind of weariness of dread , of waiting for the worst , grew in Arren all day long . Impatience and a dull anger rose in him . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead as the land of death itself ! " " Do not say that , " the mage said sharply . He strode on a while and then went on , in a changed voice , " Look at this land ; look about you . This is your kingdom , the kingdom of life . This is your immortality . Look at the hills , the mortal hills . They do not endure forever . The hills with the living grass on them , and the streams of water running . . . . In all the world , in all the worlds , in all the immensity of time , there is no other like each of those streams , rising cold out of the earth where no eye sees it , running through the sunlightand the darkness to the sea . Deep are the springs of being , deeper than life , than death .... " He stopped , but in his eyes as he looked at Arren and at the sunlit hills there was a great , wordless , grieving love . And Arren saw that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time whole , as he was . " I can not say what I mean , " Ged said unhappily . But Arren thought of that first hour in the Fountain Court , of the man who had knelt by the running water of the fountain ; and joy , as clear as that remembered water , welled up in him . He looked at his companion and said , " I have given my love to what is worthy of love . Is that not the kingdom and the unperishing spring ? " " Aye , lad , " said Ged , gently and with pain . They went on together in silence . But Arren saw thep188world now with his companion 's eyes and saw the living splendor that was revealed about them in the silent , desolate land , as if by a power of enchantment surpassing any other , in every blade of the wind-bowed grass , every shadow , every stone . So when one stands in a cherished place for the last time before a voyage without return , he sees it all whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen it before and never will see it again . As evening came on serried lines of clouds rose from the west , borne on great winds from the sea , and burnt fiery before the sun , reddening it as it sank . As he gathered brushwood for their fire in a creek-valley , in that red light , Arren glanced up and saw a man standing not ten feet from him . The man 's face looked vague and strange , but Arren knew him , the Dyer of Lorbanery , Sopli , who was dead . Behind him stood others , all with sad , staring faces . They seemed to speak , but Arren could not hear their words , only a kind of whispering blown away by the west wind . Some of them came toward him slowly . He stood and looked at them , and again at Sopli ; and then he turned his back on them , stooped , and picked up one more stick of brushwood , though his hands shook . He added it to his load , and picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked back . There was no one in the valley , only the red light burning on the grass . He returned to Ged and set down his load of firewood , but he said nothing of what he had seen . All that night , in the misty darkness of that land empty of living souls , when he woke from fitful sleep he heard about him the whispering of the souls of the dead . He steadiedhis will , and did not listen , and slept again . Both he and Ged woke late , when the sun , already a hand 's breadth above the hills , broke free at last from fog andp189brightened the cold land . As they ate their small morning meal the dragon came , wheeling above them in the air . Fire shot from his jaws , and smoke and sparks from his red nostrils ; his teeth gleamed like blades of ivory in that lurid glare . But he said nothing , though Ged hailed him , crying in his language , " Hast found him , Orm Embar ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raking the wind with his razor talons . Then he set off flying fast to the west , looking back at them as he went . Ged gripped his staff and struck it on the ground . " He cannotspeak , " he said . " He can not speak ! The words of the Making are taken from him , and he is left like an adder , like a tongueless worm , his wisdom dumb . Yet he can lead , and we can follow ! " Swinging up their light packs on their backs , they strode westward across the hills , as Orm Embar had flown . Eight miles or more they went , not slackening that first , swift , steady pace . Now the sea lay on either hand , and they walked on a long , falling ridge-back that ran down at last through dry reeds and winding creek-beds to an outcurving beach of sand , colored like ivory . This was the westernmost cape of all the lands , the end of earth . Orm Embar crouched on that ivory sand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath coming in gasps of fire . Some way before him , between him and the long , low breakersof the sea , stood a thing like a hut or shelter , white , as if built of long-bleached driftwood . But there was no driftwood on this shore which faced no other land . As they came closer Arren saw that the ramshackle walls were built up of great bones : whales ' bones , he thought at first , and then saw the white triangles edged like knives , and knew they were the bones of a dragon . They came to the place . Sunlight on the sea glitteredp190through crevices between the bones . The lintel of the doorwaywas a thighbone longer than a man . On it stood a human skull , staring with hollow eyes at the hills of Selidor . They stopped there , and as they looked up at the skull a man came out of the doorway under it . He wore an armor of gilt bronze of ancient fashion ; it was rent as if by hatchet blows , and the jeweled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern , with arched , black brows and narrow nose ; his eyes were dark , keen , and sorrowful . There were wounds on his arms and in his throat and side ; they bled no longer , but they were mortal wounds . He stood erect and still , and looked at them . Ged took one step toward him . They were somewhat alike , thus face to face . " Thou art Erreth-Akbe , " Ged said . The other gazed at him steadily and nodded once , but did not speak . " Even thou , even thou must do his bidding . " Rage was in Ged 's voice . " 0 my lord , and best and bravest of us all , rest in thy honor and in death ! " And raising his hands , Ged brought them down in a great gesture , saying again those words he had spoken to the multitudes of the dead . His hands left behind on the air a moment a broad , bright track . When it was gone , the armored man was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had stood . Ged struck at the house of bones with his staff , and it fell and vanished away . Nothing of it was left but one great ribbonethat stuck up out of the sand . He turned to Orm Embar . " Is it here , Orm Embar ? Is this the place ? " The dragon opened his mouth and made a huge , gasping hiss . " Here on the last shore of the world . That is well ! " Thenp191holding his black yew staff in his left hand , Ged opened his arms in the gesture of invocation , and spoke . Though he spoke in the language of the Making , yet Arren understood , at last , as all who hear that invocation must understand , for it has power over all : " Now do I summon you and here , my enemy , before my eyes and in the flesh , and bind you by the word that will not be spoken till time 's end , to come ! " But where the name of him summoned should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A silence followed , as if the sound of the sea had faded . It seemed to Arren that the sun failed and dimmed , though it stood high in a clear sky . A darkness came over the beach , as though one looked through smoked glass ; directly before Ged it grew very dark , and it was hard to see what was there . It was as if nothing was there , nothing the light could fall on , a formlessness . Out of it came a man , suddenly . It was the same man they had seen upon the dune , black-haired and long-armed , lithe and tall . He held now a long rod or blade of steel , graven all down its length with runes , and he tilted this toward Ged as he faced him . But there was something strange in the look of his eyes , as if they were sun-dazzled and could not see . " I come , " he said , " at my own choosing , in my own way . You can not summon me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I only am alive ! You think you are , but you are dying , dying . Do you know what this is I hold ? It is the staff of the Grey Mage , he who silenced Nereger ; the Master of my art . But I am the Master now . And I have had enough of playing games with you . " With that he suddenly reached out the steel blade to touch Ged , who stood as if he could not move and could not speak . Arren stood a pace behind him , and allp192his will was to move , but he could not stir , he could not even put his hand on his sword-hilt , and his voice was stopped in his throat . But over Ged and Arren , over their heads , vast and fiery , the great body of the dragon came in one writhing leap and plunged down full-force upon the other , so that the charmed steel blade entered into the dragon 's mailed breast to its full length : but the man was borne down under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand , arching his back and beating his vaned wings , Orm Embar vomited out gouts of fire and screamed . He tried to fly , but he could not fly . Malign and cold , the metal lay in his heart . He crouched , and the blood ran black and poisonous , steaming , from his mouth , and the fire died in his nostrils till they became like pits of ash . He laid down his great head on the sand . So died Orm Embar where his forefather Orm died , on the bones of Orm buried in the sand . But where Orm had struck his enemy to earth , there lay something ugly and shriveled , like the body of a big spider dried up in its web . It had been burned by the dragon 's breath and crushed by his taloned feet . Yet , as Arren watched , it moved . It crawled away a little from the dragon . The face lifted up toward them . There was no comeliness left in it , only ruin , old age that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sockets of the eyes were empty and had long been empty . So Ged and Arren saw at last the livingface of their enemy . It turned away . The burnt , blackened arms reached out , and a darkness gathered into them , that same shapeless darknessthat swelled and dimmed the sunlight . Between the arms of the Unmaker it was like an archway or a gate , thoughp193dim and without outline ; and through it was neither pale sand nor ocean , but a long slope of darkness going down into the dark . There the crushed , crawling figure went , and when it came into the darkness it seemed suddenly to rise up and move swiftly , and it was gone . " Come , Lebannen , " said Ged , laying his right hand on the boy 's arm , and they went forward into the dry land.  |p194The  yew-wood staff in the mage 's hand shone in the dull , lowering darkness with a silver gleam . Another slight glimmeringmovement caught Arren 's eye : a flicker of light along the blade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon 's act and death had broken the binding spell , he had drawn his sword , there on the beach of Selidor . And here , though he was no more than a shadow , he was a living shadow , and bore the shadow of his sword.  |p195There  was no other brightness anywhere . It was like a late twilight under clouds at the end of November , a dour , chill , dull air in which one could see , but not clearly and not far . Arren knew the place , the moors and barrens of his hopeless dreams ; but it seemed to him that he was farther , immensely farther , than he had ever been in dream . He could make out nothing distinctly , except that he and his companion stood on the slope of a hill , and before them was a low wall of stones , no higher than a man 's knee . Ged still kept his right hand on Arren 's arm . He moved forward now , and Arren went with him ; they stepped over the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them , descendinginto the dark . But overhead , where Arren had thought to see a heavy overcast of clouds , the sky was black , and there were stars . He looked at them , and it seemed as if his heart shrank small and cold within him . They were no stars that he had ever seen . Unmoving they shone , unwinking . They were those stars that do not rise or set , nor are they ever hidden by any cloud , nor does any sunrise dim them . Still and small they shine on the dry land . Ged set off walking down the far side of the hill of being , and pace by pace Arren went with him . There was terror in him , and yet so resolved was his heart and so intent his will that the fear did not rule him , nor was he even very clearly aware of it . It was only as if something deep within him grieved , like an animal shut up in a room and chained . It seemed that they walked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a short way ; for there was no passing of time there , where no wind blew and the stars did not move . They came then into the streets of one of the citiesp196that are there , and Arren saw the houses with windows that are never lit , and in certain doorways standing , with quiet faces and empty hands , the dead . The marketplaces were all empty . There was no buying and selling there , no gaining and spending . Nothing was used ; nothing was made . Ged and Arren went through the narrow streets alone , though a few times they saw a figure at the turning of another way , distant and hardly to be seen in the gloom . At sight of the first of these , Arren started and raised his sword to point , but Ged shook his head and went on . Arren saw then that the figure was a woman who moved slowly , not fleeing from them . All those whom they saw  --  not many , for the dead arc many , but that land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no purpose . None of them bore wounds , as had the semblance of Erreth-Akbe summoned into daylight at the place of his death . No marks of illness were on them . They were whole and healed . They were healed of pain and of life . They were not loathesome as Arren had feared they would be , not frightening in the way he had thought they would be . Quiet were their faces , freed from anger and desire , and there was in their shadowed eyes no hope . Instead of fear , then , great pity rose up in Arren , and if fear underlay it , it was not for himself , but for all people . For he saw the mother and child who had died together , and they were in the dark land together ; but the child did not run , nor did it cry , and the mother did not hold it or ever look at it . And those who had died for love passed each other in the streets . The potter 's wheel was still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever sang . The dark streets between dark houses led on and on , andp197they passed through them . The sound of their feet was the only sound . It was cold . Arren had not noticed that cold at first , but it crept into his spirit , which was , here , also his flesh . He felt very weary . They must have come a long way . Why go on ? he thought , and his steps lagged a little . Ged stopped suddenly , turning to face a man who stood at the crossing of two streets . He was slender and tall , with a face that Arren thought he had seen , though he could not re- member where . Ged spoke to him , and no other voice had broken the silence since they stepped across the wall of stones : " O Thorion , my friend , how come you here ! " And he put out his hands to the Summoner of Roke . Thorion made no answering gesture . He stood still , andhis face was still ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , making a little light there or meeting it . Ged took the hand he did not offer and said again , " What do you here , Thorion ? You are not of this kingdom yet . Go back ! " " I followed the undying one . I lost my way . " The Summoner'svoice was soft and dull , like that of a man who speaks in sleep . " Upward : toward the wall , " said Ged , pointing the way he and Arren had come , the long , dark , descending street . At that there was a tremor in Thorion 's face , as if some hope had entered into him like a sword , intolerable . " I can not find the way , " he said . " My lord , I can not find the way . " " Maybe thou shalt , " Ged said , and embraced him , and then went forward . Thorion stood still at the crossroads , behind him . As they went on , it seemed to Arren that in this timeless dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  |p198neither  east nor west , no way to go . Was there a way out ? He thought how they had come down the hill , always descending , no matter how they turned ; and still in the dark city the streets went downward , so that to return to the wall of stones they need only climb , and at the hill 's top they would find it . But they did not turn . Side by side , they went on . Did he follow Ged ? Or did he lead him ? They came out of the city . The country of the innumerable dead was empty . No tree or thorn or blade of grass grew in the stony earth under the unsetting stars . There was no horizon , for the eye could not see so far into the gloom ; but ahead of them the small , still stars were absentfrom the sky over a long space above the ground , and this starless space was jagged and sloped like a chain of mountains . As they went on , the shapes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rain . There was no snow on them to gleam in starlight . They were black . The sight of them struck desolation into Arren 's heart . He looked away from them . But he knew them ; he recognized them ; his eyes were drawn back to them . Each time he looked at those peaks he felt a cold weight in his breast , and his nerve came near to failing . Still he walked on , always downward , for the land fell away , descending toward the mountains ' feet . At last he said , " My lord , what are .... " He pointed at the mountains , for he could not go on speaking ; his throat was dry . " They border on the world of light , " Ged answered , " even as does the wall of stones . They have no name but Pain . There is a road across them . It is forbidden to the dead . It is not long . But it is a bitter road . " " I am thirsty , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they drink dust . "  |p199They  went on . It seemed to Arren that his companion 's gait had slowed somewhat , and sometimes he hesitated . He himself felt no more hesitation , though the weariness had not ceased to grow in him . They must go down ; they must go on . They went on . Sometimes they passed through other towns of the dead , where the dark roofs made angles against the stars , which stood forever in the same place above them . After the towns was the empty land again , where nothing grew . As soon as they had come out of a town , it was lost in the darkness . Nothing could be seen , before or behind , except the mountains that grew ever nearer , towering before them . To their right the formless slope fell away as it had done , how long ago ? when they crossed the wall of stones . " What lies that way ? " Arren murmured to Ged , for he craved the sound of speech , but the mage shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way without an end . " In the direction they went , the slope seemed to be growing less and always less . The ground under their feet gritted harshly , like lava-dust . Still they went on , and now Arren never thought of returning or of how they might return . Nor did he think of stopping , though he was very weary . Once he tried to lighten the numb darkness and weariness and horror within him by thinking of his home ; but he could not remember what sunlight looked like or his mother 's face . There was nothing to do but to go on . And he went on . He felt the ground level under his feet ; and beside him Ged hesitated . Then he too stopped . The long descent was over ; this was the end ; there was no way further , no need to go on . They were in the valley directly under the Mountains of Pain . There were rocks underfoot and boulders about them ,  |p200rough  to the touch like scoria . It was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river of water that had once run here or the course of a river of fire , long since cold , from the volcanoes that reared their black , unmerciful peaks above . He stood still , there in the narrow valley in the dark , and Ged stood still beside him . They stood like the aimless dead , gazing at nothing , silent . Arren thought , with a little dread but not much , " We have come too far . " It did not seem to matter much . Speaking his thought , Ged said , " We have come too far to turn back . " His voice was soft , but the ring of it was not wholly muted by the great , gloomy hollowness around them , and at the sound of it Arren roused a little . Had they not come here to meet the one they sought ? A voice in the darkness said , " You have come too far . " Arren answered it , saying , " Only too far is far enough . " " You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can not go back to the wall of stones . You can not go back to life . " " Not that way , " said Ged , speaking into the darkness . Arren could hardly see him , though they stood side by side , for the mountains under which they stood cut out half the starlight , and it seemed as if the current of the Dry River were darkness itself . " But we would learn your way . " There was no answer . " We meet as equals here . If you are blind , Cob , yet we are in the dark . " There was no answer . " We can not hurt you here ; we can not kill you . What is there to fear ? " " I have no fear , " said the voice in the darkness . Then slowly , glimmering a little as with that light that sometimesp201clung to Ged 's staff , the man appeared , standing some way upstream from Ged and Arren , among the great , dim masses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that figure which had appeared to them on the dune and on the beach of Selidor , but older ; the hair was white and thickly matted over the high forehead . So he appeared in the spirit , in the kingdom of death , not burnt by the dragon 's fire , not maimed ; but not whole . The sockets of his eyes were empty . " I have no fear , " he said . " What should a dead man fear ? " He laughed . The sound of laughter rang so false and uncanny , there in that narrow , stony valley under the mountains , that Arren 's breath failed him for a moment . But he gripped his sword and listened . " I do not know what a dead man should fear , " Ged answered . " Surely not death ? Yet it seems you fear it . Even though you have found a way to escape from it . " " I have . I live : my body lives . " " Not well , " the mage said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Embar was not gentle with that body . " " I can mend it . I know secrets of healing and of youth , no mere illusions . What do you take me for ? Because you are called Archmage , do you take me for a village sorcerer ? I who alone among all mages found the Way of Immortality , which no other ever found ! " " Maybe we did not seek it , " said Ged . " You sought it . All of you . You sought it and could not find it , and so made wise words about acceptance and balance and the equilibrium of life and death . But they were words  --  lies to cover your failure  --  to cover your fear of death ! What man would not live forever , if he could ? And I can . I am immortal . I did what you could not do and thereforep202I am your master ; and you know it . Would you know how I did it , Archmage ? " " I would . " Cob came a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no eyes , his manner was not quite that of the stoneblind ; he seemed to know exactly where Ged and Arren stood and to be aware of both of them , though he never turned his head to Arren . Some wizardly second-sight he might have , such as that hearing and seeing that sendings and presentments had : something that gave him an awareness , though it might not be true sight . " I was in Paln , " he said to Ged , " after you , in your pride , thought you had humbled me and taught me a lesson . Oh , a lesson you taught me , indeed , but not the one you meant to teach ! There I said to myself : I have seen death now , and I will not accept it . Let all stupid nature go its stupid course , but I am a man , better than nature , above nature . I will not go that way , I will not cease to be myself ! And so determined , I took the Pelnish Lore again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . So I rewove it and remade it , and made a spell  --  the greatest spell that has ever been made . The greatest and the last ! " " In working that spell , you died . " " Yes ! I died . I had the courage to die , to find what you cowards could never find  --  the way back from death . I opened the door that had been shut since the beginning of time . And now I come freely to this place and freely return to the world of the living . Alone of all men in all time I am Lord of the Two Lands . And the door I opened is open not only here , but in the minds of the living , in the depths and unknown places of their being , where we are all one in the darkness . They know it , and they come to me . And the dead too mustp203come to me , all of them , for I have not lost the magery of the living : they must climb over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the souls , the lords , the mages , the proud women ; back and forth from life to death , at my command . All must come to me , the living and the dead , I who died and live ! " " Where do they come to you , Cob ? Where is it that you are ? " " Between the worlds . " " But that is neither life nor death . What is life , Cob ? " " Power . " " What is love ? " " Power , " the blind man repeated heavily , hunching up his shoulders . " What is light ? " " Darkness ! " " What is your name ? " " I have none . " " All in this land bear their true name . " " Tell me yours , then ! " " I am named Ged . And you ? " The blind man hesitated , and said , " Cob . " " That was your use-name , not your name . Where is your name ? Where is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you died ? You have forgotten much , 0 Lord of the Two Lands . You have forgotten light , and love , and your own name . " " I have your name now , and power over you , Ged the Archmage  --  Ged who was Archmage when he was alive ! " " My name is no use to you , " Ged said . " You have no power over me at all . I am a living man ; my body lies on the beach of Selidor , under the sun , on the turning earth . Andp204when that body dies , I will be here : but only in name , in name alone , in shadow . Do you not understand ? Did you never understand , you who called up so many shadows from the dead , who summoned all the hosts of the perished , even my lord Erreth-Akbe , wisest of us all ? Did you not understand that he , even he , is but a shadow and a name ? His death did not diminish life . Nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not here ! Here is nothing , dust and shadows . There , he is the earth and sunlight , the leaves of trees , the eagle 's flight . He is alive . And all who ever died , live ; they are reborn and have no end , nor will there ever be an end . All , save you . For you would not have death . You lost death , you lost life , in order to save yourself . Yourself ! Your immortalself ! What is it ? Who are you ? " " I am myself . My body will not decay and die  --  " " A living body suffers pain , Cob ; a living body grows old ; it dies . Death is the price we pay for our life and for all life . " " I do not pay it ! I can die and in that moment live again ! I can not be killed ; I am immortal . I alone am myself for-ever ! " " Who are you , then ? " " The Immortal One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King . " " Say my name . I told it to you but a minute since . Say my name ! " " You are not real . You have no name . Only I exist . " " You exist : without name , without form . You can not see the light of day ; you can not see the dark . You sold the green earth and the sun and stars to save yourself . But you have no self . All that which you sold , that is yourself . You have givenp205everything for nothing . And so now you seek to draw the world to you , all that light and life you lost , to fill up your nothingness . But it can not be filled . Not all the songs of earth , not all the stars of heaven , could fill your emptiness . " Ged 's voice rang like iron , there in the cold valley under the mountains , and the blind man cringed away from him . He lifted up his face , and the dim starlight shone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had no tears , having no eyes . His mouth opened and shut , full of darkness , but no words came out of it , only a groaning . At last he said one word , barely shaping it with his contorted lips , and the word was " Life . " " I would give you life if I could , Cob . But I can not . You are dead . But I can give you death . " " No ! " the blind man screamed aloud , and then he said , " No , no , " and crouched down sobbing , though his cheeks were as dry as the stony rivercourse where only night , and no water , ran . " You can not . No one can ever set me free . I opened the door between the worlds and I can not shut it . No one can shut it . It will never be shut again . It draws , it draws me . I must come back to it . I must go through it and come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It sucks at me and sucks at me . I can not leave it . I can not close it . It will suck all the light out of the world in the end . All the rivers will be like the Dry River . There is no power anywhere that can close the door I opened ! " Very strange was the mixture of despair and vindictiveness , terror and vanity , in his words and voice . Ged said only , " Where is it ? " " That way . Not far . You can go there . But you can not do anything there . You can not shut it . If you spent all your power in that one act , it would not be enough . Nothing is enough . "
