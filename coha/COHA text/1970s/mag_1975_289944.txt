In the early 1940s , at the height of the Japanese invasion of China , Chiang Kai-shek wrote a book about China 's past " humiliation " and future " reconstruction . " He titled it China 's Destiny , but Chiang might have called it My Destiny . He saw little distinction between his own fate and that of the giant , sprawling , poverty-stricken land that he ruled for just over 20 years . All his life , the lean and ambitious soldier fought bravely , though in the end vainly , to shape history to his personal specifications . When he died of a heart attack last week at the age of 87 in his exile capital of Taipei , he was still clinging to the sacred fiction that it was he and nobody else who was the legitimate father of all of modern China . His death could hardly have been more dramatically timed . To Chiang , the rout of anti-Communist forces in Indochina must have seemed the inevitable continuation of the long and losing Asian struggle against Communism , in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremely self-assured , Chiang Kai-shek ( the name means " firm rock " ) was one of the century 's major figures . As a revolutionary and ardent nationalist , he had an epic career embracing both triumph and tragedy . Sixty years of his life were consumed by bitter uphill struggles : first against the crumbling Manchu dynasty , then against the warlords who flourished in its ruins , next against invaders from imperial Japan and finally against the Communist peasant army that foreclosed his dream of dominance in China and chased him to an unhappy exile on Taiwan . <P> Paradoxically , the generalissimo cast a longer shadow on the century than on China itself . At the peak of his international prestige , he was a smiling , greatcoated member of the wartime Big Four , along with Roosevelt ( his great champion in the West ) , Stalin and Churchill . He was a founder of the United Nations , gaining for China a permanent seat on the Security Council . It was in America that his image was most exalted . " To American eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominant forces in the world . He was the champion of ' the new Asia . ' " But when he failed to live up to his image as China 's man of destiny , and the new Asia so ardently expected by Americans failed to materialize , Chiang found himself abandoned by the Truman Administration . That placed Chiang at the center of an unhappy chapter in postwar U.S. history : the hate-filled witch hunt for those who " lost China . " <P> In fact , China was never really " lost " : it had never been won . The U.S. tended to see Chiang 's China as a unified nation with an effective central government , even idealizing it as a breeding ground for an American-style democracy . But it was none of these . Just before his death , Sun Yat-sen had described China as " a heap of loose sand . " Chiang Kai-shek tried to build on that sand the foundations of a modern and united country . But during Chiang 's entire tenure as China 's leader , the country remained beset by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chiang 's ruling party and , not least , his intractable insistence on shortsighted , ineffective policies .
