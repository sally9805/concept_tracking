 | Inside the New snowmobile Engines @# New engines , hot and sassy , are the talk of this year 's snowmobiles . Some are Japanese , some are European , some are American . These are second , and even third-generation , engines . Many include design and production tricks learned from cycles and outboards but tailored to the special demands of snowmobiles . Others are right off the drawing boards for snowmobiles and are aimed not only at ' making the sport more exciting but - king it socially more acceptable . Are there real differences in these . ines ? or is there a trend toward standardization ? To find out , PoPULAR SCIENCE dissassembled and examined some representative engines . Our samples included Arctic Cat ( Kawasaki ) , Polaris ( Fuji ) , Canadian Curtiss-Wright ( Kyoritsu Noki ) , Bombardier ( Rotax ) , JLO Rockwell , Evinrude , Kiekhaefer , Mercury , Gotbrud , and Moto-Ski ( BSE Taiwan ) . Some of the things we looked for were : ? Basic machining quality , fitup , service access , ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder studding , gaskets , crankcase assembly , and bearings . ? Porting and airflow arrangements . ? New trends , real differences , innovations . In fairness , we did n't run the engines and could n't evaluate starting , vibration ? or subjective performance " feel . " Nor did we dig into specialized , high-performance racing engines , preferring to stick to family snowmobile models in the stock configuration in which you would receive them . There is no question that the Jap-  | anese engines are here in force . The Japanese have a lot going for them . ? An enormous background in small , two-stroke engines based originally on the cycle trade . ? A tradition ? and the machine tools to back it ? of fine production techniques and handsomely finished products . ? Skilled assemblers , necessary for what are really rather delicate engines with high power load . As we tore down the Japanese engines , these points were confirmed . The castings were clean ; everything was well machined , including some surfaces that did n't really need it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : an impression of maximum effort to wring the last ounce of finely tuned power out of rather light structures . Kawasaki , for example , uses chrome-plated bores in the aluminum castings rather than @# @# cast-iron sleeves . ( Interestingly , competitive engine builders told me that in making their own tests , they milked dynamometer horsepowers out of Kawasaki engines far in excess of sales-literature ratings . ) Fuji , used by Polaris , gave an exceptional impression of real muscle construction with such features as an exceedingly solid crankcase that appears to be sand-cast , and six necked cylinder-head studs . This engine is centrifugally cooled . Other impressive details : stainless-steel air shrou. ? and a heavy-duty starter . In m notes was this summary for Polaris : " big , husky , beautifully built engine . No flies on us . None of this mea that the European or American e gine builders are about to roll o% and play dead . Although the Jai nese engines were very well built , w found more genuine advanced ens neering in the American engines . Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n. an independent engine builder . - has a brand-new plant turning o some of the hottest engines on the cir cuit under the Kiekhaefer Aeromari label . Bolens and Northway will use these engines this year . Kiekhaefer 's prototypes won races last year and we predict they 'll be contenders again . Outstanding Kiekhaefer features : unique porting ; through-bolts from head to the bottom of the crankcase to resist enormous combustion prsures ; double bearings at the output shaft end ; full breakerless solid-sta ignition and surface-gap plugs . C says that everything he ever lear in competition engines has gone i these new models . To take one a is to admire it . On the other side of Fond du I . Mercury has not lagged behind . disassembled their new 644cc Hu cane horizontal engine . It is the unusual and fascinating of the with these novel features : ? Horizontal cylinder positio for low hood profile . ? Cylinder barrels , heads , crankcase upper half cast as a si unit . Ferrous barrels are cast into structure and can be oversized repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? Solid-state ignition with ca tor discharge through massive po on the make , not break ; this will f ? a lot of mechanics . Surface-gap to sten plugs . ? Reed-valve induction , stain - steel reeds in center main bearing . ? A big , scientifically design muffler on the bottom of the engine This muffler may be the biggest . news in an industry plagued by noise complaints and striving vigorously to  | do something about it . The muffler , which looks like an oil pan , chops noise to 80 dbA at 50 feet , and on the logarithmic db scale , 80 dbA is substantially quieter than the 82 dbA industry target for ' 72 . Part of the secret is operating this big engine at only 35 hp . This works out to a very comfortable 59 BMEP . The engine should run forever at this load , but the big gain is the lower noise level . What 's BMEP ? It means Brake Mean Effective Pressure , and it 's a mathematical value representative of the mean combustion-chamber pressure during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-working engine design in terms of breathing and combustion , it is also true that the higher the BMEP , the higher the loads on bearings , rings , cylinder walls , and other working parts . For two-stroke BMEP : 396,000 x Bhp BMEP- = ? x displ. ( cu . in . ) Listed horsepower , when reduced to working pressures , will provide a fair idea of where your engine ranks in terms of mechanical loading , criticality of tuning and , probably , noise . Modest BMEPs in the 60- to 70-psi bracket will probably be easiest to live with . Incidentally , to convert cc 's to cubic inches , multiply by .061 . If you service your own snowmobile , some of the things we ran into may be helpful to know : ? Metric wrenches are apparently a necessity for all engines built overseas . Some Japanese engines have ISO i international standard ) threads , and attempting to replace a missing fastener with a standard thread can cause damage in soft aluminum . ? Tightening torques are critical ; : i rque wrenches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Use care to avoid cracking castings. o On two or more cylinders , snug down the intake-manifold flanges first ; then tighten the cylinder hold-down fasteners . This allows the mating surface of the cylinders and flanges to square up by slight shifting of the cylinder . ? On axial fans , make , borrow , or buy a fan-holding tool when loosening the pulley nut to adjust belt tension . Wedging the fan to prevent turning will result in breakage every time . e Do not attempt to remove the flywheel without the proper puller . Never strike the end of the crankshaft to loosen the wheel . You can seriously damage shaft and crankcase . As we disassembled and reassembled these engines , some of our reactions were inevitably personal and @# @# @# subjective . Evinrude 's 437cc model had a solid , comfortable mechanical feel . It was put together , American style , in a straightforward manner ; gave a sense of rugged practicality . The reed-valve induction system , with a readily accessible valve plate just under the carburetor , is used for smoother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and less intake noise . Other reed-valve engines are Mercury , Suzuki , and Johnson . Reed valves vs. third port is an argument that will probably never be settled . With a third-port system , an engine can be set up for blazing top speed , yet be hard to start , be rough at idle and low speeds , and lack low-end torque . It depends on what you want . My preference is for a snowmobile that will slip along quietly at a few miles an hour down a meandering stream bed or through wooded stands where high speed is impossible and good slow-speed performance is essential . You may prefer high-speed skimming across wide-open areas or competition racing . It seems likely , howPolaris unit is well engineered and a husky performer . A centrifugal blower , flywheelmounted , cools the engine , eliminating belt problems . Carbs are float Mikunis. ever , that a continued trend toward family snowmobiling and away from racing , except for pros and semipros , will promote more reed-valve-induction systems . It may , in fact , bring on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intake and exhaust , and excellent low-end torque . Honda is known to be contemplating entry into the snowmobile market with a fourcycle powered vehicle . Ignition and carburetion . Although we were impressed by similarities between the Japanese and European engines , the real common ground seemed to be ignition and carburetion . Most had a flywheel magneto with an extra coil for lighting , a set of breakers for each spark plug , and a springloaded centrifugal advance to rotate the cam . In a number of surprisingly candid comments , engineers from several manufacturers expressed the view that this ignition system left much to be desired , especially at starting speeds . They all indicated a preference for solid-state ignition , or a vari-  | ation of it , but high cost is the rub . The only actual breakerless , capacitor-discharge system we tried was on the Kiekhaefer engine . ( There is one on Outboard Marine 's Johnson and Evinrude engines , however . ) In addition to the simplicity of point-free operation , the voltage buildup rate is much faster than in induction systems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In turn , this reduces the chance of preignition from glowing plug electrodes . Mercury uses an interesting variation of this system , not fully breakerless , and it also fires surface-gap plugs . Both are superior ignition systems . Diaphragm carburetors seemed almost standard on our engines except on Polaris ( Fuji ) which had twin Mikuni float types . Mercury also uses a float carburetor , and engineers there expressed the feeling that diaphragm carburetors just could n't match the metering control of a float type . Moreover , Merc 's new engine has nonadjustable jets . Ski-Doo introduced fixed jets on the Elan last season ? another trend beginning ? Axial cooling fans are in the majority ? partially , at least , to improve engine profile . In our opinion , they are a weak link in these highly critical air-cooled engines , where overheating can do so much harm so quickly . If the belt is in good condition and properly tensioned , all is well ; but belts wear and break . Unfortunately , replacing or adjusting one of these belts was in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husky wrench ( usually metric ) and a means of holding the fan from turning . Few snowmobilers will have the tools in the field when needed , and the inevitable running with a loose belt will have ittoll . Centrifugal cooling with - Olt blower mounted on the flywheel. avoids all belt problems . Conclusions : Looking back at the whole picture , we had to conclude that the Japanese and European en gines had a great deal in common , theJapanese showing the influence of their broad background in cycles . We would expect , for example , that Kawasaki will be a hot-performing engine in snowmobiles set up to take full advantage of a light engine . We do n't , however , think that CCW , JLO - Rotax , or Kohler are going to be left in the snowflakes . CCW is Japanese the others are European-made. engineering differences are not th great , and it is likely that the hott competition will be where the snow mobiler never hears about it : in pri to the manufacturer . The real innovations ? designs based right from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to family snowmobiling needs , a recognition of snowmobiling 's public image ? are found on engines bui right here in the U.S. at KiekhaeferMercury , and Johnson-Evinrude. @#
