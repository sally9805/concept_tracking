txt Abu Dhabi has bought a 44 percent interest in a London skyscraper . Kuwait is shopping around for quality real estate and for shares in companies in Britain , West Germany , Switzerland , and the United States . Iran , in the most spectacular coup so far among oil-producing states , is taking over a 25.05 percent interest in Krupp , the West German steel giant ? a deal that gives Iran a seat on the supervisory board of the parent company as well . Gradually , cautiously , major oil-producing states are beginning to put the billions of dollars they are earning from the quadrupled price of oil thisyear to work for themselves in the form of investments , rather than in short-term " hot money " in the Eurodollar market . Shunning financial spotlight With the flamboyant exception of the Shah of Iran , the fabulously wealthy oil producers of the Persian ( or Arab ) Gulf seem to have a horror of looming too conspicuously on the financial horizon of Western capital and monetary markets . The richest of them all , Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , $17 billion of which will have to be banked or invested outside the country , as Oil Minister , Sheikh Ahmed Zaki alYamani recently hinted . The Saudis have been the soul of discretion , and while there has beentalk of supermarkets in Georgia and real estate in Florida , little is known about where their money is going except by those bankers directly involved in handling the money . Billions of dollars Altogether , the oil producing states are going to have $50 billion to $60 billion of oil income this year , it is estimated . Oil-consuming nations , rich or poor , are having to scrape together the sums needed to pay this huge bill . But most of the richest of the producers are unable to spend their incomes within their own countries . Kuwait alone will have an oil income of $10 billion this year . Iran will have $20 billion . // *Sheikhs with oil billions look to West to invest // Western oil-consuming nations , and international organizations like the World Bank or the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab oil money , all designed to get oil producers to lend consumers the money they need to keep buying their oil . Producers wary The producing nations have been wary of getting involved in such schemes too quickly . They have let their money pile up instead in short-term deposits on the Eurodollar market , which now is said to be awash in up to $180 billion worth of currencies , principally dollars , not under the control of any national government . But Western economies are in a precarious state . Stock markets in New York , London , and elsewhere are M a slump . Inflation is rampant . And with floating exchange rates , even 3xperienced banks have had their ringers burned . The abrupt failure of West Germany 's Herstatt Bank ( Cologne ) in June caused many financial institutions to be leery of foreign3xchange transactions . The big international banks face mother problem . With the short-term leposits they obtain from Arab and ) ther oil producers , they must put , ogether medium or long-term loans ' or customers in oil-consuming nations who need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting more and more difficult , o put these loans together , and some mnks are discouraging deposits bemuse of this . The smaller banks are still crying or funds , but the Arabs have been discouraged because of the well-publicized difficulties of Franklin in the United States and the Herstatt bankruptcy in West Germany . Larger American banks now are beginning to find Arab money coming to them for longer-term deposits . Treasury Secretary William E. Simon , on his recent trip to the Middle East , said he was encouraged by the " responsibility " of Arab investors and offered them special Treasury certificates , medium or long-term , with rates of interest approximating the commercial . He is hopeful that Saudia Arabia , for instance , may take $5 billion to $10 billion worth of these certificates . Kuwait 's London office Kuwait , probably the most experienced of the Arab investing countries , has had for some time an investment office in London , and is thinking of setting up similar offices in other European capitals . The Financial Times already regards Kuwait as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , still stands in a unique position . The Shah seems determined to tie his country into the financial and industrial fabric of the advanced Western nations . He has placed huge orders in France for nuclear power stations . He has promised France a credit of $1 billion over the next three years , and another $1.2 billion to Britain . Iran , unlike Saudi Arabia , resolutely opposes a lowering of oil prices , and has threatened to cut back production to keep up prices in case world demand slackens . Some Iranians are said to fear that their country may be unable to make good this threat if the Shah continues to increase his commitments in the same spectacular manner he has done so far . The total of his commitments is said to approach $10 billion already .
