txt in a mirror to visualize their effect in situ , because the tapestry process involved reversal . Their order on the walls has been convincingly reconstructed , and it is evident that their placing , both in relation to each other and to the frescoes on the upper walls ( which they roughly match in size ) , was as carefully worked out both formally and iconographically as was that of the designs for the Stanza della Segnatura.447 To take but one parallel , the tapestry of The Healing of the Lame Man , the central scene on the wall devoted to Peter , is placed beneath Botticelli 's Healing of the Leper . The fresco has a central temple with two main figures in the foreground , there are towering rocks to either side , and tall , straight trees divide the picture area . In the tapestry , two central figures stand before the pedimented doorway to the Temple , and the rich columns echo the placing of the rocks and trees in Botticelli 's composition . And iconographically The Healing of the Leper is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potestas ordinis , which Peter has just received in the tapestry immediately to the left , The Donation of the Keys , and is putting into action at the Beautiful Gate . We can imagine the problems of figure style with which Raphael had to cope . He must compete with but not overwhelm the frescoes in the Chapel . He must produce designs which would stand out clearly in the bland colours of tapestry . His figures must possess sufficient power to survive translation by craftsmen into // . another medium . This conjunction of needs ensured simple and straightforward compositions with little detail ( which would be obliterated in tapestry ) , and a much greater emphasis on the figures than had been the case even in the Segnatura . Because the figures bulk very large within the patterned borders of the tapestry , they form their own space . Since the Segnatura , there had been a marked increase in rhetoric in Raphael 's figures ; this is taken to the utmost in the Tapestry Cartoons where , contained within simplified silhouettes , and with sweeping articulated gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than , as in the Segnatura , a graceful ) version of ideal form and clear purpose within an ideal setting . The power of the figures is partly anatomical ( and that derives from Michelangelo ) , but is intensified because they are in all cases pushed to the front plane of the pictorial stage and become like the relief sculpture of Michelangelo 's Ceiling . The monumental simplicity of the forms on the original tapestries was helped by gold thread , which was added not for ornamentation , but to clarify the drawing . For it is draughtsmanship which is the key to the impact of the series : the Cartoons themselves and the many prints made from preparatory drawings presented Raphael 's pupils and later imitators with an encyclopedia of human emotions , and of powerful and credible poses which magnify those emotions to the ideal . We might suggest that the Cartoons are the very limit to which an artist can project a style of restraint , balance and nobility without incurring that magnificent vacuity which can be sensed in the Stanza dell'Incendio . In such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to be expected that the // caption Simon Gribelin , after Raphael : The Death of Ananias . Engraved 1707 . Tapestries would be suffused with the spirit of Antiquity . Raphael ( appointed Keeper of Inscriptions and Remains of the City of Rome in August 1515 ) informs his scenes with a mixture of inferred fact and projected ideal , the result of much study of the biblical texts and of a wide range of ancient and contemporary references . The Healing of the Lame Man is inspired by Early Christian sarcophagi of the ' columnar ' type , as well as by the depiction of the same subject on the Ciborium of Sixtus IV , made by various artists c. 1475/80 for the High Altar of old St Peter 's ( now in the Grotte Vaticane ) . This , in its turn , is decorated with scenes from the lives of Peter and Paul in a style much inspired by Roman imperial sculpture . Similarly , The Death of Ananias owes its arrangement to the Oratio Augusti relief on the Arch of Constantine , and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city gate ' variety.450 Usually , the figure style on such sources is inadequate for Raphael 's needs , and we can sense rather than demonstrate his debt to Giotto , Masaccio , Donatello and Michelangelo . Most of a Renaissance artist 's production was , of necessity , religious , but occasional secular commissions allowed him to manifest an even greater sympathy with the spirit of Antiquity . The Villa Farnesina was a countrified retreat which , in architecture and decoration , was intended to look like its antique counterpart . Raphael 's first work there was The Triumph of Galatea ( perhaps c. 1512 , Sala di Galatea ) . The convincingly antique central figure455 extends the corkscrew twist of the London St Catherine ( c. 1508 ) and projects its dynamism into a composition with other figures . Galatea must glance toward the adjacent fresco of Polyphemus ( by Sebastiano del Piombo ) , but at the same time she controls her chariot , which moves out toward the spectator . Her pose is echoed by the other figures : the left-hand group near to the plane of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are linked by a putto whose pose is that of Galatea herself . Flying putti aim their bows at the girl , and we now realize how tightly the composition is organized : they point to Galatea 's head , which is the centre of a circle , with the twirling bodies of nymphs and tritons on the circumference . A wheel is formed , and the spokes are Galatea 's limbs , her upward glance , the dolphin reins , and the arrows of the putti . The dynamism of the work is increased because the spectator views this and the other frescoes of land and sea as if from inside a loggia , marked by the wall pilasters , so that the tightly packed figures in The Triumph of Galatea explode towards him . Several years later , probably in 1517 , Raphael designed and in part executed frescoes for the loggia of the Farnesina ( they were completed in January 1518 ) . The loggia , opening directly onto the garden with its rich population of antique statues , had as its theme Cupid 's love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arbour resembling a garden structure , and stretched simulated ' tapestries ' along the centre part of the flat vault to keep out the sun . These ' tapestries ' have scenes of The Council of the Gods and The Wedding Banquet of Cupid and Psyche while the ten spandrels relating walls to ceiling show earlier episodes ; intervening lunettes show how Cupid conquers all the gods through love . Perhaps the walls were to receive more ' tapestries ' to complete the story , 427 or even real woven tapestries , which would have made the loggia 's links with Mantegna 's Camera degli Sposi even clearer . Certainly , the whole // . scheme is taken from some antique decoration now lost : it is the kind of conceit which appealed to the ancient Romans , and which Raphael might have studied in the buried ruins of their villas.414 This type of room and subject-matter , its style , 446 its arrangement of scenes within fanciful architecture and its subtle connection with the garden , greatly influenced artists from Giulio Romano at Mantua to Annibale Carracci , Pietro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources are more evident is the decoration of the Vatican Logge ( 1518 ? 19 ) with scenes from the Old Testament set amid grotesques and stuccowork . Again , Raphael was too busy to do the actual painting , but the whole idea depends from his professional concern for archaeology . His post of Keeper of Inscriptions and Remains made him overseer of the excavations necessary to make a decayed city into a new one : he would have seen all discoveries , whether of statues or buildings , in order to decide which should be preserved . His passionate concern about the destruction of Rome is clear from the Letter to Leo X , quoted above ( p. 59 ) . The most important discovery for the designs for the Logge was the Palace of Nero near the Colosseum called the Golden House , or Domus Aurea , because of its luxury . Parts of this mostly buried structure had been known since at least 1480 , and the style of room decorations had found popularity418,439 at the hands of Perugino ( 1499/1500 , Cambio , Perugia ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1492-A ) . Raphael uses structures inspired by the Golden House to decorate both the walls and the vaults and to frame the biblical scenes , which he treats as framed pictures . Of similar inspiration is the stuccowork which Giovanni da Udine , from Raphael 's shop , modelled on the arches separating the bays , incorporating within that antique world some works by great moderns ( including Donatello 's David and the Jonah in S. Maria del Popolo , designed by Raphael ) as if to place them on an equal footing with the famous antiques reproduced , such as the Apollo Belvedere . There were other schemes from the Raphael shop of the same nature as those for the Logge : for the Bathroom of Cardinal Bibbiena , 419,453 the Loggetta ( both Vatican , 1519 ) , and the great loggia of the Villa Madama , decorated by pupils after the master 's death . All these decorations and the schemes they spawned445,449 would have been pointless had their connections with ancient Rome gone unrecognized . Thus far in this account of Raphael 's career a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to his panel pictures . This is deliberate and reasonable : buon fresco was the natural medium for the Renaissance artist , and a coherent outline of Renaissance classicism in painting could almost dispense with the less prestigious panels . Furthermore , Raphael 's frescoes were often more public " and hence of a grandiloquent conception , and continuously available in their original setting . The same applies to the Tapestries which , like the frescoes , were well-known through prints . Raphael 's first important altarpiece of the Roman period , The Madonna of Foligno ( 1512 ? , Vatican ) , is based on the stable Leonardesque triangle with which he had experimented in Florence . Helping this construction to weld heaven to earth and saints to Virgin and Child is the circular aureole against which Mother and Son are seen ; this is echoed not only in the semi-circular top of the panel itself , and in the rainbow under the Virgin 's feet , but also in the disposition of the figures on the earth . All forms are grand , all gestures unequivocal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Child is balanced by their immediacy ; this is contrived on the one hand by the geometrical control and by the splendid torsion of the two figures and , on the other , by the Virgin 's pose . Her right leg forms a link with the right arm of St Francis , and , because the figures on the ground are so tangible , with us . The simplicity of the finished work is only apparent , for every element of the panel is exactly judged , right down to the placing of the saints and donor close up against the frame , which gives to the work the immediacy and impact that Raphael later achieved in the Tapestry Cartoons . A development of the Madonna of Foligno is to be seen in his most influential altarpiece , The Sistine Madonna ( 1514 ? , Dresden ) .411,417,441 Here , the sense of immediacy , of caption Raphael : Madonna of Foligno , c. 1512 . Rome , Vatican . 105 THE HIGH RENAISSANCE Word made Flesh , is greater , and derives again from the composition . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture towards us . The picture surface is treated like a window , with a ledge ( on which rests Sixtus ' crown , and the two wistful and slightly bored putti ) , and a curtain rail , the curtain on which is gathered back to reveal the heavenly vision against another cloud of angel faces . Here is Leonardo 's triangle in movement : the forceful blue and red of the Virgin 's robes is drawn out by the splendid gold of Sixtus ' cope , and a twist that is a confirmation of the Virgin 's descent is provided by the fine contrapposto of St Barbara . Raphael has very plausibly hidden the saints ' feet in cloud , so that they intercede for us from a position intermediate between heaven and earth . The two putti , far from upsetting the tone of the vision , temper it , as they do the composition : for as well as providing links in the circular movement , and defining our earth , their expressions soften the monumental seriousness of the Virgin and Child . In composition if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . in mood , The Sistine Madonna is very similar to the roughly contemporary Triumph of Galatea . The Sistine Madonna is effortlessly clear in form , psychology and the illusion of movement . Nothing is forced or gratuitous , and the tightness and exactitude of the composition can be tested by using the mind 's eye to alter a gesture here , or a curve of drapery there . The psychology partakes of the same balance between hieratic grandeur and the tender affection of the face-against-face of Virgin and Child . Their emotional identity is again underlined by the composition , not by grimaces or overt emotionalism : the gentle curves of the Child interlace with the Mother 's arms and garments , encapsulated within the voluptuous sweep of her veil . The tactility of the painting is , of course , also a result of the oil technique and of the chiaroscuro which it allows . Even in fresco , a comparison between early and late Stanze shows that Raphael was moving toward a more forceful and atmospheric presentation of the human body . This can be seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pitti ) which is stylistically and compositionally close to The Sistine Madonna . Here , the emotional realism is made explicit by the circularity of the composition , which closely echoes the tondo shape , using the turned wood chairback to anchor it in the vertical . This lightreflecting piece of gilded wood , and the Virgin 's headscarf , are so detailed that the forms seem as real as the emotions they express . Yet this acuity is balanced by the broadness of execution of the rest of the panel : the detail is all on the picture plane , and shadowy vagueness increases as the forms are canted into depth . Compare the similar devices of Sixtus ' crown and equally intricate cope in The Sistine Madonna : in both works , a conjunction of fluidity and precision effects an overwhelming sense of presence , of palpitating life . These same characteristics are present in Raphael 's best portraits , 430 particularly the Baldassare Castiglione ( c. 1514/15 , Paris , Louvre ) , which might be called his critique of the Mona Lisa . Gone are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , and the intricacy of clothing and 106 . landscape , in favour of a plain , light-filled ground and a more open face . The pose remains , as does some of the chiaroscuro . Leonardo 's interest in textures has also been retained , and is exploited in a softly-lit description of grey fur against black cloth , set off by the white of the cravat and the flesh tones of face and hands . In spite of the apparent simplicity , this portrait of a humanist is infinitely rich in psychology ; the slight tilt of the head , the twist of the body , the clasping of the hands , the soulful eyes ? all bespeak a nervous energy which is the result of those reticent yet abundant movements within the calm and stable triangle of body and head . In effect , the calm , level eyes in the spot-lit face reveal the man 's soul , for the slight restlessness of the drapery is made to indicate personality . Raphael therefore presents us with two portraits in one : the outer man , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sensibility , which has impact precisely because it forms a counterpoint to the statuesque exterior . This alchemy can be better appreciated by comparing the work with La Velata ( 1515 ? , Pitti ) , similar in structure but empty of psychology . Just as Raphael 's altarpieces , portraits and frescoes change from a simple stasis to a more vigorous type of composition during the second decade , so his smaller panels pursue a . // similar development . The process begins in about 1510/11 with the Alba Madonna ( Washington ) , which is startlingly different from even those Michelangelo-inspired works of his Florentine period . It is , rather like the London St Catherine , conceived in an altogether more heroic form . Whereas earlier exercises had looked back to the Leonardo of The Virgin of the Rocks , or to Michelangelo 's Taddei Madonna , this work explores the formal problems inherent in Leonardo 's theme of The Virgin and Child with St Anne , clothed in the heroic bodies of the Sistine Ceiling . Here , as in Leonardo 's prototype , the resultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evident that much further tension will dispel the classical balance . . That point is reached in The Madonna of the Curtain ( c. 1514 , Munich ) ; this makes an interesting comparison with The Madonna of the Chair , which perhaps precedes it a little . The sense of presence so strong in that work is even more imposing in The Madonna of the Curtain : in the tondo , the arm of the chair defines the picture plane , the distinction between our space and painted space . No such conventional barrier exists in the other work , nor are the attitudes so restrained . If , in the tondo , the forms complement one another harmonically , then here similar poses have been adjusted to create an outward-straining tension centred on the pose of the Christ Child , whose left knee and foot protrude into our space . This arrangement , together with the fluidity of the chiaroscuro and the Michelangelesque heroism of form , point the way to a series of multi-figure altarpieces of the following years , not often autograph , and too sensuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus The Canigiani Holy Family ( 1508 ? , Munich ) , where a pyramid of five figures is tightly formed , develops into the Madonna dell'Impannata ( c. 1514 , Pitti ) , where the formal structure begins to lack cohesion . La Perla ( c. 1518 , Madrid , Prado ) continues the trend toward elaboration of incident and weakening of classical structure . The work which best demonstrates the incipient confusion of Raphael 's late style is The Transfiguration ( begun 1518 ? , Vatican ) , which was completed by Giulio Romano and Penni after Raphael 's death . The design depicts two distinct events , namely the Transfiguration itself and the curing of a young boy of possession by the Devil which follows the Transfiguration in St Matthew 's account . The composition makes the events synchronous , and uses the scene of healing to add drama to the Transfiguration , which hitherto had been depicted as a tranquil event . An added spur to drama was probably the commissioning by Giulio de ' Medici of a companion altarpiece from Sebastiano del Piombo , a follower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Gallery ) . On Raphael 's death , the top section of The Transfiguration was nearly complete , the lower part in sketch form only . Little wonder , therefore , that the contributions of pupils somewhat overbalance the scene with Christ , who is above and behind the large foreground figures . In other words , the lower section seems a logical development of the inflated figure style visible in the later Stanze , but the figures lack that logical concordance between pose and intention which triumphs in // captionRaphael : Transfiguration , 1518 . Rome , Vatican , Pinacoteca. the Tapestry Cartoons . Perhaps this late work can be seen , as one commentator has it , as ' the explicit and far-reaching investigation of Leonardesque principles ' . 440 Certainly , it overreaches the bounds of classical decorum in its strong chiaroscuro and powerful yet sometimes vacuous gesturing and posturing . If we judge the work by Raphael 's intentions , as seen in a group of beautiful drawings , 438 we must nevertheless accept that the painting , had it been totally autograph , would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive and dramatically powerful than anything in the Segnatura , something of a stature to inspire the classical revival of the seventeenth century , and perhaps the painted equivalent of the Tapestry Cartoons . Throughout his life , Raphael 's multifarious 109 . activities built up for him a formidable reputation among his contemporaries.422 He was praised as a restorer of the beauties of ancient Rome and , in Baldassare Castiglione 's characterization , as the man who breathed life into the corpse of the city of Rome , who endowed it with antique decorum , and whom , for this reason , the gods carried off . His death did not spell the end of his style , which was continued not only by his principal assistants ( particularly Giulio Romano ) and by prints made after his drawings and finished compositions ( chiefly by Marcantonio Raimondi ) , 42 ? but also by the fame of his own paintings , which were much studied . Because of his ability to assimilate lessons from the styles of others , and to continue and develop solutions to artistic problems on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many media and genres , Raphael was to be quite simply the most influential of all European artists.4is,435,436 The solutions which he propounded were , in terms of style , composition and psychology so fruitful that they could be developed even further by succeeding generations . Far from being frozen in the ice of passionless perfection ( as he is so often presented ) , Raphael 's treatment of a sensuous yet ideal humanity gave to the classical tradition a vigour which would last to the age of Ingres . Michelangelo We have seen that Michelangelo played an important part in the development of Raphael 's style . Indeed , in all but his late works , and in both painting and sculpture , Michelangelo took up and enriched the classical tradition as he saw it in the works of Giotto , Masaccio , Ghiberti , Donatello and Jacopo della Quercia . It was probably while he was in Ghirlandaio 's shop ( 1488/9 ) that he made drawings after Giotto and Masaccio , obviously impressed by their statuesque monumentality ; he sought , in those drawings , to increase even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of bulk transmitted to the garments by the body underneath , Vasari tells us that he next entered the ' sculpture garden ' of Lorenzo de ' Medici , where he could draw and model after specimens of antique and modern sculpture under the eye of Bertoldo , a pupil of Donatello and a sculptor of wide antiquarian interests.478 None of his sculpture from this period survives , but we can be sure that he owed his lifelong interest in Neoplatonism and its ultimate identity with Christian philosophy to the circle around Lorenzo , to people like Landino , Ficino , Pico della Mirandola and Poliziano , the tutor to the Medici children . Neoplatonism , with its belief that the beautiful is but the outward sign of virtue , led Michelangelo to express his vision of Christianity ( for he did little secular work ) by figures that are as beautiful as antique statues , yet are sometimes imbued with a tormenting self-knowledge which distinguishes them from their models.477 Throughout his career , the study of Antiquity provided the basis of his style , 458 ' 471 helped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is The Madonna of the Stairs ( 1489/92 , Florence , Casa Buonarroti ) , which shows the Virgin , seated in pure profile and staring straight ahead . Its stern monumentality is inspired by the example of Donatello , 464 its form just possibly by Greek grave stelae . To these sources Michelangelo adds the powerful torsion of the Christ Child encased within the silhouette of His // mother : a token of things to come . No one in Florentine art except Donatello had ever made an image of the Virgin with so much of the prophetess about her : she is the ancestor of the great figures on the Sistine Ceiling.482 Another early work , The Battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs ( 1492 ? , Casa Buonarroti ) , is clearly a reinterpretation of antique battle sarcophagi : its vigour derives partly from the torsion of individual figures , and partly from the symmetry of their arrangement in a circular movement around the central figures . Surely the work must have been one of the sources for Raphael 's Galatea , which uses the same compositional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fame had preceded him in the form of a Sleeping Cupid in imitation of the antique , 479 which he had sold to a Roman dealer.476 This is lost , but his Bacchus ( 1496/7 , Florence , Bargello ) , another imitation of an antique type , was bought by the connoisseur Jacopo Galli and placed in his garden of antiques , which it was evidently considered to rival . The company it kept there reminds us of one source , but another is the work of Jacopo della Quercia , particularly his figured portals for S. Petronio in Bologna ( 1425-38 ) . Michelangelo worked in that church in 1494/5 , and elements of Jacopo 's sinuous classicism appear throughout his work , from the nervosity of his Pieta for St Peter 's ( 1498/9 ) to the figures on the Sistine Ceiling . The St Peter 's Pieta also profits from a study of Leonardo ( especially The Virgin of the Rocks ) in the pyramidal simplicity of the composition and the understatement of emotion . Leonardesque also is the elaboration of the drapery , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Notre Dame ; sent to Flanders 1506 ) by a more monumental simplicity of form and an austerity of psychology which parallels that of the contemporary David . Just as Raphael develops Leonardo 's pyramidal composition in the early 1500s , so too does Michelangelo.461 Further variations on the form are provided by three tondi of this period . The marble Pitti Tondo ( 1503/5 , Florence , Bargello ) , more massive and simple than the St Peter 's Pieta , includes a Christ derived from the mourning genius type . on antique reliefs . The marble Taddei Tondo ( c. 1505-6 , London , Royal Academy ) , an even more vigorous triangle of meaning , is again heavily dependent on the antique for its motifs.483 The painted Doni Tondo ( 1504 ? , Uffizi ) takes the scheme even further : Michelangelo would have studied Leonardo 's cartoon of The Virgin and Child with St Anne ( London , National Gallery ) , which was on exhibition in Florence in 1501 , and would have recognized it as a new departure for that artist both in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of form.486 All four works ? the Bruges Madonna and the three tondi ? signal a new stylistic direction in their greater simplicity of form and their neglect of those qualities of delicacy , intricacy and prettiness most sought in contemporary Florentine art . They lead to the growth of Michelangelo 's version of the High Renaissance manner . This is best seen in the marble David481 ( 1501/4 , Florence , Accademia ) , a subject of great political importance to the Florentines.465 Michelangelo 's figure looks back to the Fortitudo on Nicola Pisano 's Pisa Baptistery Pulpit , and to the Hercules on the Porta della Mandorla of Florence Cathedral . Hercules appears on seals of the city of Florence , and Vasari underlines the significance of the David by the gloss that ' as David // . defended his people and governed with justice , so should this city be defended with courage and governed with justice ' . And indeed , whereas former representations such as Donatello 's and Verrocchio 's had shown David as boyish and clothed , Michelangelo showed him in the guise of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splendour of his body , a counterpart to the nobility of his mind , is only partly a result of the colossal height of nearly seventeen feet ; it also derives from the physical power which is latent in the body . The clarity of the pose and the hero 's restrained anger are evident ; David also carries a sling , but it is mostly hidden so that the statue is a generalized symbol of David and his accomplishments , rather than a specific reference to the fight with Goliath . In fact David has not yet met Goliath : he stands in a more confident version of the pose of Donatello 's St George , outside the Palazzo della Signoria , looking defiantly toward the threat from the south.473 The David is therefore both biblical and antique hero , and a political symbol of Florentine liberty ; but why is it so huge ? Michelangelo certainly looked on the commission as a challenge to make something of the block of marble , supposedly ' ruined ' by an earlier artist ; this is why the statue is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique traditions of colossal statues both of gods and as commemorative monuments ( the Horse-Tamers of Monte Cavallo have been suggested as a source ) , 985 and the Florentine tradition as well.480 Donatello made two ' giants ' for the Cathedral , a Joshua of terracotta ( a brave experiment in such a medium , 1410 ) and a Hercules/David , of which a model with metal plates over stone was made in 1415 . Both are lost , but both were known to Michelangelo who was himself to make a gigantic statue of Hercules for Fontainebleau , which is also lost.463 Henceforth , Michelangelo concentrates on the heroic male nude , as in The Battle of Cascina , begun in 1504 for the Sala del Maggior Consiglio ( cf. pp. 92-3 , above ) of the Palazzo Vecchio . Leonardo 's scene designed for the same room had been of violent action in the heat of battle ( The Battle of Anghiari ) . Michelangelo did not show a battle at all , but a call to arms while Florentine soldiers were bathing . His subject-matter is therefore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haul themselves from the water and get dressed ; indeed , the work ( known only through copies and prints , as is that of Leonardo ) is popularly called The Bathers . This work perhaps reflects Michelangelo 's preference for sculpture over painting : he tends 112 . to isolate the figures , and to treat them each as individual studies and not as parts of a coherent composition . The same is often true on the Sistine Chapel Ceiling where , excepting the antique bas-reliefs of the scenes , the greater part of the area is covered by painted statues in splendid isolation . Little wonder that The Bathers was a popular academy for students ( who obliterated it from the wall by tracing ; it never got further than the underdrawing ) , or that it was usually studied for individual figures or groups , and not as a complete composition . Michelangelo 's vision of Antiquity was radically enlarged by the discovery of the Laocoon in Rome in January 1506 , the style of which accentuated tendencies of power and bodily tension in his own work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animate the David , and he drew on the Trojan priest 's physical suffering as a metaphor for the spiritual inspiration of a long line of prophets , saints and sibyls both painted and sculpted . The St Matthew ( 1506 , Florence , Accademia ) , for example , is inspired by the antique , but it might have been begun before the discovery of the Laocoon . No matter , for Michelangelo could have borrowed the contrapposto pose from either the Pasquino ( one of the famous antique talking statues of Rome ) , or from Donatello 's majestic group of Abraham and Isaac on the . 113 . Campanile of Florence Cathedral. * The St Matthew presents a vision of revelation , and is a harbinger of the Julius Monument , first projected in 1505 but never completed . The structure of this tomb , judging from Michelangelo 's sketches , from the ' slaves ' made for it , and from the various modern reconstructions of how it was intended to look , resembled that of antique monuments , particularly Roman imperial mausolea or temporary funeral pyres.466 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary descriptions . Different projects for the Julius Monument were to occupy Michelangelo for much of his life , and it is a commonplace that he partly mitigated the ' Tragedy of the Tomb ' on the Sistine Chapel Ceiling , which he painted , against his will , between 1508 and 1512 . The Julius Monument was intended to grace the new St Peter 's , the very centre of the artistic revival of Rome ( a much reduced version was eventually erected in S. Pietro in Vincoli ) . Despite all difficulties , how much easier was it to paint the enormous structure on the vault of the Sistine Chapel , where he could indulge his sculptor 's preference for a large number of massive single figures within a painted architectural structure , which in its turn frames a series of figured scenes usually treated as bas-reliefs . The Ceiling complements the famous frescoes on the walls , which show Man sub lege and sub gratia , for it tells the first part of the story of Man , beginning with the Creation of the world , and Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then of sin which will rule until Man is redeemed by Christ . The four pendentives in the four corners contain Old Testament scenes of temporal salvation which are types for Christ 's salvation of the world through crucifixion , and eight of His ancestors are shown in triangular niches , four down either side of the Ceiling . In the spandrels between these figures // are twelve prophets and sibyls , the seers Jewish and pagan who foretold Christ 's coming . They , in their inspiration , are contrasted with the putti who decorate their thrones , the bronze coloured figures chained to either side , and the ignudi above their heads , who show varying degrees of awareness of the scenes they witness . The style of the Ceiling changes as Michelangelo progresses from above the entrance towards the altar wall . The first scene , The Flood , is the most painterly and complicated of all , a version of The Bathers , so to speak . Michelangelo then begins to limit his treatment to a few figures which bulk large in the frame , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The contiguous ignudi , which are almost mirror images of each other ( the result of reversing each cartoon and thereby using it twice ) are in poses both elegant and simple , without strain . The five corresponding seers likewise adopt straightforward if powerful attitudes . The next stage , with The Expulsion from Paradise and The Birth of Eve , shows an increasing concern with monumentality , perhaps coupled with the realization that the figures already painted were either too small or not sufficiently demonstrative to make an impression on the spectator at ground level . From this point on , Michelangelo therefore increases the size of the figures , gives more drama to poses and gestures , and thereby magnifies the impact of the story . Now the ignudi , far from being symmetrically opposed , are often strongly contrasted , with one facing in , the other facing out , the one in extension , the other in contraction , or the one tense , the other calm and relaxed . But it is in the seers that this enlargement of scale is most evident . Whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm and relaxed , the later Libyan Sibyl is not only greater in size but also magnified in psychological power . This numen depends from the increased inventiveness and intensity of the pose . The Delphica holds her left arm across her torso , pointing right and looking left ; the Libica intensifies this movement , helped by the heavy book of prophecies she is holding , and by the tall block on which she rests her left foot // and which , as it were , electrifies the contrapposto . Of all the seers it is the last , Jonah , who is the most impressive : his pose mimics those of the ignudi ( it shows Michelangelo 's study of the Laocoon group ) , and reflects his excitement and wonder at seeing God , for his gaze is directed upward , toward the scene of God separating Light from Darkness . A similar development informs the four pendentives . The early pair , David and Goliath and Judith and Holofernes , have small figures within an illusionistic pictorial space . The pair adjacent to the altar wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jonah , and the inspiration for both is the Laocoon group . The Sistine Ceiling , in its structure , its sculptural figures and its histories , is mainly a reinterpretation of antique art467 but it is also a reworking of Quattrocento elements , taken particularly from Ghiberti , Masaccio and Jacopo della Quercia . This substitute for the Julius Monument makes figures the form and colouring of which are sculptural , as is their location in niches for the seers and on pedestals for the ignudi . The use of medallions and histories in what is effectively bas-relief strengthens the reminiscence of a monument in marble ; and it has been suggested that the whole Ceiling forms a ' Tree of Jesse ' for Pope Julius II ( and is therefore some substitute for the Tomb ) .468 The main structural source of the Ceiling , and of some of its devices , is the antique Roman triumphal arch ( and this is even more clearly the case with the designs for the Tomb ) . The triumphal arch showed Michelangelo how to articulate a blank wall with pilasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures . The Arch of Constantine , in Rome , has all these features , with genii reclining in the angle formed by the arch and the architectural Order , and something approaching caryatids decorating the pedestals of the columns . All these elements Michelangelo borrows . The columns become square pilasters with caryatids , marking out the rhythm of the Ceiling and providing pedestals for the ignudi ; the same pilasters are given strongly projecting cornices , which further define the history section and distinguish it from the line of seers down either side , and which also provide the sides of the seers ' thrones . The ignudi themselves , as well as some of the medallions they support , are taken from the antique . The bronze-coloured nudes , to either side of the seers , and confined in their triangular niches , are variations of the genii on triumphal arches . Some of the larger figures are also specifically antique , like God the Father in The Creation of Adam , taken from a Victory on the Arch of Titus , and one of Christ 's ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arch of Septimius Severus . For some of the histories , Michelangelo looks to fellow Florentines . The Expulsion from Paradise is a reworking both of Masaccio 's treatment in the Brancacci Chapel and of Jacopo della Quercia 's on the portal of S. Petronio , Bologna . The Creation of Adam and The Creation of Eve likewise depend on Jacopo , but the Gothic swirl of his light draperies has in all cases been monumentalized . The same process applies in his borrowings from Ghiberti , whose Gates of Paradise provide one of the ideas for Adam in The Creation of Adam , while his God the Father is reworked into the Creator in Michelangelo 's Creation of Eve . Michelangelo transforms his borrowings , and clothes them in a style more heroic and infused with greater energy and inspiration than anything hitherto seen . Like the Stanza della Segnatura , the Sistine Ceiling is a definitive statement of classicism ; or , in Tolnay 's phrase , ' a second reality superposed on our own and containing the essence of existence ' . It is the expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty of Antiquity and the inspiration of Christianity . Both elements are evident in what is justly the most famous scene on the Ceiling , The Creation of Adam , whose ' Greekness ' has even provoked the suggestion that Michelangelo could have seen a drawing by Cyriacus of Ancona of the Parthenon Theseus.484 Here , Man is indeed made in the image of God , but it is an image conditioned by the Renaissance vision of Antiquity . The scene epitomizes the sculptural clarity of the Ceiling particularly in the later parts where the intricacies of detailing and of small figures and complicated compositions have given way to a vigorous gran- // deur in which the basic unit is the individual human body . Such concentration on the individual body in movement made it easy for students to excerpt figures and put them to different uses . Thus one of the last scenes , The Separation of Sky from Water , presented Raphael with a pose which he developed into the wonderful gesture of the apostle in The Sacrifice at Lystra . The seers and the ignudi were particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stucco sculptures ) to Annibale Carracci 's Farnese Gallery and beyond . Despite the interval between the Ceiling and Michelangelo 's two other fresco commissions , the frescoes are remarkably homogeneous in style , given that no architectural structure was possible in either case . The Last Judgement ( 1536 ? 41 ) on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel may be regarded as an affirmation of the classical principles of the Ceiling at a time when the Mannerist styles were popular in Rome . The two frescoes in the Pauline Chapel of the Vatican , The Crucifixion of Peter and The Conversion of Saul ( 1542 ? 50 ) , are as athletic and inspired in their figure style as the Ceiling itself , except for what can only be called a mystification of emotion which is an element in the increasing terribilita of the ageing Michelangelo . After the completion of the Sistine Ceiling , Michelangelo 's sculpture went through a phase which , in its exploration of tendencies present in the Laocoon group , can be called Mannerist . The two works nearest to the Ceiling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished 1513 ? , Paris , Louvre ) , both intended for the 1513 version of the Julius Monument , owe their manner to the ignudi and the bronze captives between the prophets and sibyls on the Ceiling , and their origin to one of Laocoon 's sons and to the priest himself respectively . The statue of Moses ( 1515/16 ) for the same version of the Tomb is also reminiscent of the Ceiling , for his pose is a combination of those of Joel and Isaiah . What explanation might be offered for the slaves is difficult to determine , for their place on the Tomb and their meaning are matters for conjecture . The Moses certainly . possesses greater emotional stability , but the whole conception of the work is inflated beyond any classical norm , and might be said to make a mannerism of the style of the prophets on the Ceiling . From the 1520s , Michelangelo increasingly sought satisfaction in architecture and therefore gave less and less time to sculpture . In the Medici Chapel ( 1524-33 , Florence , S. Lorenzo ) , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , he broke the bounds of classicism in sculpture as in architecture.472 The chapel contains the statues of Giuliano de ' Medici and Lorenzo de ' Medici , seated one to either side , looking toward a group of the Virgin and Child on the altar wall . The clarity of these figures ( descendants , again , of the seers on the Ceiling ) contrasts with the stronger torsion and much less precise emotional complexion of the figures which rest on the tomb chests underneath the seated heroes : Dusk and Dawn beneath Lorenzo , and Day and Night beneath Giuliano . Classicism demands stasis , or rationally induced movement . These figures , however , represent eternal change as , under the influence of restless emotion , their bodies appear // to slip down the sloping tops of the sarcophagi . They are palpable reminders not of Man 's perfectibility and glory , but of instability and approaching death and destruction , as would have been the mouse which , Condivi assures us , Michelangelo thought of introducing to symbolize the frailty of Man and his environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compositional intricacy , made these four figures examples for later Mannerists : imitations of them and of the general design of the tombs stretch into the seventeenth century . A similar finesse and comparable pose inform Michelangelo 's Victory Group ( 1527/8 ? , Florence , Palazzo Vecchio ) , which it is instructive to compare with the David or the St Matthew . Both these works had a simple grandeur occasioned by the meaning they embodied in their poses . The Victory , on the other hand , assumes an elaborate posture of ' easy strain ' , his lissom knee between the shoulder blades of a much heavier opponent ; he twists his own arm across his body , but for no apparent reason other than to impart a satisfying twist to the composition . The gesture is there for effect , and is without sufficient cause ; it is artificial ? a mannerism . That this is but a phase in Michelangelo 's sculpture is seen by his return to a classical vein in the two statues for the c. 1542 version of the Tomb : The Active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ' Rachel ' ) . They show us a sculptural version of the Pauline Chapel frescoes , on which he was working during these years : heavy figures with broadly treated drapery and stern , almost Hellenistic-looking faces . His final sculptures , like the last works of Donatello , are part of a private world . In the Florence Pieta ( Florence , Cathedral , by 1555 ) and the Rondanini Pieta ( Milan , Castello Sforzesco , 1552 , reworked 1563/4 ) the physical beauty of the human body dissolves away as Michelangelo searches for a new mode by which to convey the religious emotion of his old age ; the radiant classicism of his earlier work is replaced by an expressionism which is almost Gothic . Michelangelo 's art is scarcely as important for the development of the classical tradition as . 118 . that of Raphael who , we might say , reduced some of Michelangelo 's creations from the awe-inspiring to the safely grand . Often , the greater power of Michelangelo 's art led imitators to copy the form of his individual figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , provided a selection of figures and compositional structures covering a much wider range of human activity and emotion.460 For this reason , Michelangelo 's influence in Italy , France462,469 and England47s is broader in the Mannerist , 457 Baroque and Romantic periods than in the seventeenth-century classical revival or under Neoclassicism , when his manner was thought of as too powerful.459 Titian and Roman classicism It is tendentious to introduce Venetian art into a survey of classicism for , in spite of the abundant interest of Venetian artists in the antique , 489-91,495 their work is founded in light , colour , atmosphere and the exploration of the senses rather than in the formal and intellectual qualities which generate Roman art of the High Renaissance . Thus , in spite of the evident geometry of Giorgione 's Castelfranco Madonna ( 1504 , Castelfranco ) , it is the pervasive light and gentle reverie which govern the painting , which is so different from contemporary creations by Raphael or Michelangelo . However , something must be said of Titian , because his achievement was to be seen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Venice and the form of Rome ( just as Correggio was thought a conflation of Raphael and Michelangelo.493 It was reasonably believed that such a unification represented a manner almost as worthy of imitation as that of Raphael , even by artists more interested in classicism than in Titian 's proto-Baroque bravura and compositions . Titian , like Raphael , left an oeuvre of bewildering range , and his much longer life ensured a greater variety of style . Throughout his working life , from c. 1505 to his death in 1576 , his interest in the antique waxed and waned , as did his attachment to developments in Rome . Vasari stated that Titian did not study the Ancients ; in fact he did , but for reasons different from those common to students of classicism . Titian was an intensely sensual artist whose interest in the subtleties of the mind was small . He produced nothing like the // School of Athens , for he saw Antiquity not as a collection of ideas but as an arsenal of forms and poses which he could plunder in his search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrant movement.488 Like Michelangelo , he was fascinated by the Laocoon ( of which he had a cast by c. 1520 ) . He studied the priest and his sons from every possible angle , and made use of the group in many more of his pictures than is usually realized . ( Rubens did likewise.492 ) There are numerous examples of the re-use of antique art in his work , but no evidence of the exacting scholarship of the antique shown by Raphael.496,497 For Titian , Antiquity seems to have evoked not the splendour of Rome , but the voluptuousness of splendid bodies in an idyllic setting.494 In this respect , his early mythologies are no different from those that he painted late in his life for Philip II of Spain . Sometimes he increases the nostalgia by the addition of semi-ruins , as in Diana and Actaeon ( Duke of Sutherland ) , where the huntsman happens on a scene which might have come from the Hypnerotomachia Polifili of 1499 . That amazing book , printed in Venice , a mixture of love-story and architectural fantasy , set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For in spite of his close and scholarly interest in the monuments of ancient Rome , the unknown illustrator of the Hypnerotomachia transformed everything he saw into fantasy ; Titian , with the ruined arch , the washing line , and the semi-sunken sarcophagus of the Diana and Actaeon , does much the same . Such make-believe , presented with brilliant technique and luscious colouring , was to entrance later artists . Equally important to posterity were the compositional innovations of Titian 's great altarpieces , which might almost have been produced in competition with those of the Roman High Renaissance . His Assumption of the Virgin of 1516 ? 18 in the Frari Church , Venice , is of the same date and basic construction as Raphael 's Sistine Madonna , but employs a double zig-zag to add vigour to the composition . The same structure appears in the Pesaro Altar of eight years later in the same church , but cleverly canted to one side . The . ideas in these two works were to be the staff of life to Baroque artists . Was Titian at all interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly owe a debt to Michelangelo and , in one case , the Danae of 1545/6 ( Museo Nazionale , Naples ) , he even painted a figure in a Michelangelesque manner . He was on a visit to Rome at the time , and the work might have been by way of a demonstration that he could match the Romans when he so wished . And from about 1560 reminiscences of Raphael and Michelangelo are particularly strong , as in the Transfiguration in S. Salvatore , Venice ( c. 1560 ) , which indicates a study of Raphael 's version and of his Sistine Madonna . Such comparisons , the more they are pursued , serve only to separate Titian and the whole of Venetian art from the classical tradition . We need only to observe , as it were , the historical company the Venetians were to 120 keep : Rubens and the Baroque , Watteau , Delacroix , Courbet ? the family of fleshpainters , as Zola was to remark . Nevertheless , Titian 's achievement impressed the Carracci and Poussin almost as much as it impressed Rubens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made him , like Correggio , a reinvigorating force in seventeenth-century art . Classicism and Mannerism : the growth of academies What was the inheritance of classicism for the sixteenth century ? We have seen the answer in embryo in some of the works of Michelangelo498 and Raphael , when reason and understatement are abandoned , when meaning loses its clarity , and when there is no logical connection between the meaning of a work and the forms within it . We might say that sometimes High Renaissance artists , invigorated CLASSICISM AND MANNERISM by the grandeur of their own classical style , inflated classicism into something totally different . The modern term for the result is ' Mannerism ' , from the Italian word maniera , meaning ' style ' . It is a term even more vague than ' Baroque ' or ' Gothic ' , and scholars have found difficulty in establishing its relationship not only to Renaissance classicism , but also to the traumatic Sack of Rome and to the CounterReformation with its religious revival.505 There are three basic theses concerning the way in which classicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenable , is that mannerism , is a violent reaction against everything represented by classicism : disorder replaces order , vagueness replaces precision , and profusion replaces restraint.508 The characterization is correct , but the idea of reaction is difficult to maintain , as a reading of the Third Part of Vasari 's Lives demonstrates ; that perceptive commentator on style , himself an artist , found no decisive break between the early and the mid-Cinquecento . The second thesis sees mannerism as a constant current in the arts , co-existing with the impulse to classicism and called now Gothic , now Baroque ; 499 how to give chapter and verse for such a broad notion ? The third thesis is less likely than the other two to introduce the element of religious reform , or the ' shock ' of the Sack of Rome , for its proponents see sufficient seeds of mannerism in work by Michelangelo and Raphael before 1520 to explain mannerism as an obvious development of tendencies inherent in the classical style.506 The enormous prestige of the High Renaissance achievement ' stood between the Maniera painter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedberg , and he goes on to detect in the refined idealism and abstraction of mannerist art the ' characteristics of a fin de race ' .5w Indeed , the respect of the later sixteenth century for the High Renaissance is amply demonstrated by the growth of a new type of institution which helped to underpin the classical tradition well into the twentieth century ? the academy of art.504 The Middle Ages had viewed accomplishment in art as the result of long apprenticeship and painstaking application . The High Renaissance attitude ( as // exemplified in the remarks of Leonardo ) , was that the art of painter or sculptor was worthy to rank with the liberal arts , being related more to the intellect than to the hands . The work of men like Titian and Raphael made it clear that art was a career as worthy as philosophy or letters , partly because it drew on such intellectual disciplines . There were no formal academies during the fifteenth century ; artists were trained in the shops of their masters , where they might try their hand at all manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would call an academic education . The first academy with a fixed regime for the education of artists was Giorgio Vasari 's Accademia del Disegno in Florence , 502 founded about 1560 , and referred to by the Grand Duke in 1563 as una sapienza ? a university . From the emphasis on drawing ( disegno ) , and the stipulated lectures on anatomy and geometry , together with the attention given by teachers to correcting ' faults ' in pupils ' work , it is evident that Vasari saw his brainchild as a practical extension of the ideas promoted in his Lives . The mannerist academies ? and this is a demonstration that there was no break with classicism in contemporary eyes ? all looked back to the High Renaissance rather than forward in an earnest attempt to continue and build upon that tradition.5m,503 Such , indeed , was the main intent of all academies of art until well into the nineteenth century : they were teaching institutions , and they saw in the classical tradition an approach to art which was teachable because it was rationalistic . Classicism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , in geometry and mathematics , in the things of the intellect rather than of the senses , is eminently teachable . So austere were mannerist pretensions for the education of students that Federico Zuccari , in about 1575/8 , wished to stiffen the programme of Vasari 's Academy with more theory , which he claimed had been neglected . He suggested mathematics and physics , and the establishment of a class in lifedrawing . In 1582 , Ammanati proposed lectures on perspective and composition . Apparently no such reforms were carried out until 1593 , when Zuccari founded the Accademia di San Luca in Rome , and with it the structure which has lasted to this day . Disegno was its mainstay , concentrating on the parts of the body studied first in casts after the antique , and then in life ; finally , the whole body was studied as a unit . As with Vasari 's brainchild , more seems to have been promised than was carried through , but it was from the example of the Accademia di San Luca that a really strong organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We shall see ( pp. 173ff. , below ) that this Academy , and its sister foundations , exercised a strong hold over French artistic life , and provided the State with conventional and hence predictable artists working in a highly codified manner which , taught as it were by the State , usually satisfied the authorities by its approved orthodoxy . Academies , in other words , flourished because the productions of their subsidized artists were predictable ; to work in an approved manner alone spelt success in the form of lucrative State commissions . Their foundation in the various countries of Europe , and in America as well , often represented the moment when a country 's art came of age , expressing a desire to revive national art at the well-head of the classical tradition , the art of Italy . 122 7 Classicism in Italian Architecture Brunelleschi At first sight a clear distinction can be made between Romanesque , Gothic and classical Renaissance buildings ; correct use of the classical language of architecture in the last category should make it easy to distinguish from the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . We are not only badly informed about what the Trecento or indeed the Quattrocento knew or believed about ancient architecture , but are equally vague about the stylistic intentions of the architects of those times . The matter is further complicated , as always , by the revival/survival problem ; Tuscan Romanesque , for example , can be shown to contain elements from the antique which were to be re-employed during the Renaissance.511 Occasionally it is apparent that architects were unclear about the exact period in which their models had been built ; this is the case with Brunelleschi 's imitation of elements of the Florence Baptistery in his work on the dome of the Cathedral precisely because he believed the Baptistery to be a Roman building and therefore worthy of imitation . Alberti used the same source , surely for the same reason , in his Holy Sepulchre for S. Pancrazio , Florence ( c. 1455-60 ) . Although it is selfevident that the classical style in architecture implies an interest in the remains of Antiquity and in the details of the Orders and their A medal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Alberti wished the crossing of the Tempio Malatestiano at Rimini to be crowned . decoration , it may well be that Brunelleschi 's architecture , pace his own best intentions , is only pseudo-antique . A scholar has recently asserted that ' there is not a single major work of Brunelleschi for which a plausible and specific post-antique source ( or sources ) can not be suggested ' .51i He illustrates his point by comparing the very similar ground-plan and elevation of the Old Sacristy in S. Lorenzo , Florence , and those of the much earlier baptistery of Padua Cathedral . Other scholars have demonstrated how much the details of Brunelleschi 's architecture depart from the example of the antique as we now know it to have been.513517 We must therefore make a distinction between the basic principles of classical architecture , which control its rationalism and emotional temperature , and the motifs , which can only be assimilated by the study of antique remains . Brunelleschi , as we shall see , could work in a classical manner without access to a full range of antique motifs.512,533 Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a building look antique is slight . Obviously a work which , to us , looks respectably antique can be both antique and Romanesque in inspiration , like the lantern of Florence Cathedral , which resembles the lantern of the Baptistery . The same is true of Brunelleschi 's unfinished centrally planned 123 . church of S. Maria degli Angeli , Florence , commonly believed to have been inspired by the antique Temple of Minerva Medica at Rome ; a much more likely source is the doubling of the transept of Florence Cathedral . Certainly , Michelozzo 's circular chapel at the east end of SS . Annunziata ( begun 1444 ) , which really is a copy of the Temple of Minerva Medica , met with much opposition from the critical Florentines.527 Brunelleschi is important to the classical tradition because he understood the basic principles of classical architecture ; 514 the dome of Florence Cathedral , together with its absidal chapels , forms in reality a centrally planned church . He may have taken the idea from the Baptistery or , as Vasari asserts , he may have studied antique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Baptistery Doors to Ghiberti . His biographer Manetti reports , perhaps fancifully , that ' he decided to rediscover the fine and highly skilled method of building and the harmonious proportions of the ancients . . . Together i.e. with Donatello they made rough drawings of almost all the buildings in Rome and in many places beyond the walls . . . In many places they had excavations made in order to see the junctures of the membering of the buildings , and their type ' 518 But even if some of his ideas can be easily related to the Romanesque , and even if he tends to conceive of architecture in two dimensions , as a pattern on a wall , rather than as the forming of space ( except , perhaps , in S. Maria degli Angeli ) , his example nevertheless laid the foundations of the Renaissance style . The basis of his buildings was geometry , for he believed in the power of geometry to represent and evoke beauty . Sphere and cube , and exact proportional relationships based on mathematics , made his architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the vocabulary of antique architecture ? columns , pilasters , entablatures ? might speak for itself . To such a work as the Old Sacristy of S. Lorenzo , Florence , one can apply the same terms as for Masaccio 's great frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel : reason , balance , proportion and harmony . Although architecture can not ' speak ' in the same way as painting because it lacks narrative subject , nevertheless Brunelleschi 's forms , because they evoked the past , evoked also that flood of associations which were wedded to the antique during the Renaissance . 509 Indeed , his understanding of the antique enabled Brunelleschi to adapt antique forms to the needs of the Christian religion , as well as to the technical problems raised by the construction of the enormous dome of Florence Cathedral . But while it is correct to maintain that his knowledge of Roman masonry led him to adopt a strong herring-bone formation for the masonry of the dome which did away with the need for centring , i16 it is equally true that the skeleton of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of the marble lantern to keep them from buckling , is Gothic in inspiration.515 Brunelleschi must of course // have known this , but it is pleasant to imagine him thinking his work the equal of that most influential of all antique edifices , the Pantheon . It seems likely , from the little knowledge we have , that the form of the Pantheon dome conditioned that of S. Maria degli Angeli ( 1434 ? 7 ) , which he began immediately after another postulated visit to Rome , no doubt with Donatello ( 1432/3 ) .510,5 ' 9 The centrally planned church : a Renaissance ideal In Rome , Brunelleschi surely met L. B. Alberti , who may well have inspired him to build a truly antique structure . S. Maria degli Angeli , however , is not a totally new departure in Brunelleschi 's work , for it makes explicit a type of plan already broached in the Old Sacristy of S. Lorenzo ( designed 1419 , built 1421 ? 8 ) and in the Pazzi Chapel adjacent to S. Croce ( 1430 or later ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than any other form the Renaissance interest in geometry . Because of its ' perfect ' shape ? always some variant on the square or the circle ? and patent descent from antique prototypes , it was to become the preferred shape of the ideal Renaissance church . But in practice this form was highly inconvenient . It was very difficult indeed to span such a great area without intermediate supports , and the placing of altar and congregation , as well as the planning of suitable routes for ceremonial processions , posed almost insuperable problems.523 Brunelleschi 's S. Lorenzo ( begun 1419 ) and S. Spirito ( designed 1434 or later ) , with their basilican form and flat wooden ceilings , were much more practical and still allowed the architect to exercise his interest in geometry . 125 The prototypes both formal and iconographical of the centralized plan of the Renaissance church were various.522,524 A clear Christian source was the tradition which connected the circular church with the Virgin who was frequently referred to in litanies as the ' Temple of the Lord ' ; 521 hence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgin is often depicted in paintings with the Temple of Jerusalem , popularly believed to have been a centrally planned building , as in Raphael 's Betrothal of the Virgin ( and its source , Perugino 's version in Caen , 1503/4 ) . In Perugino 's Donation of the Keys in the Sistine Chapel , the , building is indicated as an IMENSV(M) TEMPLUM , and again the Temple of Jerusalem is clearly intended . In some respects , therefore , the Virgin was the Church . Equally , antique pagan tradition connected centrally planned buildings with certain gods , // . particularly Diana , a virgin , who was on occasions compared to the Virgin Mary . During the Renaissance , antique circular temples ( many of them , of course , tombs ) were often called ' temples of Diana ' , 520 Again , the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem was centrally planned ; and its frequent imitation in Italy during the Renaissance525 usually corresponds in form with the Early Christian martyrium , a monument commemorating the death of a martyr , 31 and based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings are imitated in several Renaissance churches . The best-known example of the church as memorial is Bramante 's Tempietto beside S. Pietro in Montorio ; the above considerations make it obvious that its shape is not determined merely by mathematical aesthetics or by a desire to imitate the antique closely , for the work was intended to mark the spot where St Peter was martyred . Other examples would be Michelozzo 's rotunda527 for SS . Annunziata , commissioned as a memorial to the Marquis of Mantua , and S. Maria della Pace in Rome ( by 1483 ) , a memorial church by an unknown architect . Of course , the greatest of them all is the new St Peter 's , conceived ( but not completed ) as a centrally planned building , and planned by Julius II as a mausoleum for himself , as well as to shelter the relics of St Peter . In the question of centrally planned churches , the revival/survival problem is again much in evidence . As with Brunelleschi and the Baptistery of Florence Cathedral , so Bramante had no way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because most of the serviceable structures had been converted into churches . For Bramante , the circular mausoleum of the daughter of Constantine , S. Costanza , must have been as important as the pagan mausolea of the Appian Way , the circular Temple of Vesta by the Tiber , or the Temple of the Sibyl at Tivoli . The circular churches of the Renaissance are a mixture of pagan and Christian : Raphael 's centrally planned Chigi Chapel in S. Maria del Popolo is Christian , yet its position near the Porta del Popolo , and its shape , as well as the presence of Elijah-cum-Jove in the cupola , inevitably link it with the form and siting of pagan memorials , which had to be erected outside the City . The final link between mausoleum and church , pagan and Christian , is that baptisteries are , by long tradition , often centrally planned . They are places of death and resurrection : the death of the old life and the birth of the new . A mausoleum , for both pagans and Christians , has similar overtones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . central plan its popularity in Renaissance architectural theory is understandable . We shall meet it again when considering the work of Alberti and Bramante . Alberti , architect and scholar Brunelleschi 's S. Maria degli Angeli is the first separate centrally planned church of the Renaissance , although both the Pazzi Chapel and the Old Sacristy of S. Lorenzo are in effect separately designed buildings as well . They were the foundations on which Alberti , who dedicated his Della Pittura to Brunelleschi , built his theories , aided by the only architectural treatise to survive from Antiquity , Vitruvius ' De architectura , and by his own observation of antique remains.5s4 , ss7 // When Brunelleschi died in 1446 , many of his projects were incomplete , and were to be completed in accordance with others ' designs . Alberti 's schemes were often to suffer a similar fate , but we know his intentions better than those of Brunelleschi because his theories are clearly stated in his imitation of Vitruvius , the De re aedificatoria , which was completed by 1452.535 The first printed edition appeared in 1485 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced not only Bramante and Raphael , but also the architectural textbooks of Serlio and Palladio and , of course , the latter 's architectural style . Often dismissed as a mere theorist , Alberti 's example is in fact crucial for the classical tradition because he demonstrated how to apply the vocabulary of antique architecture to contemporary needs.529,530 Alberti 's scholarly knowledge of antique architecture was , we may be certain , much greater than that of Brunelleschi ; the older man was a consummate construction engineer , for example , whereas Alberti was a scholar and apparently never a practical architect in that sense . His position in the Papal Curia entailed not only advising the Pope on the rebuilding of St Peter 's ( an idea broached long before the time of Bramante ) but also supervising restoration work on Early Christian churches such as S. Stefano Rotondo and S. Prassede.541 It was in Rome , amidst that repository of antique solutions to the problem of how to rebuild the city in a grand manner , 546 that he composed his book on architecture.538 In the Seventh Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideal church . Unlike Vitruvius ( who has little to say about centrally planned buildings ) , Alberti ignores the basilican form in favour of the central plan . He wishes churches to be ' of great Use for stirring up Men to Piety , by filling their Minds with Delight , and Entertaining them with Admiration of their Beauty ' , and therefore recommends the central plan : the church is to be placed on a podium which will elevate it above the everyday world , and embellished by a portico such as the Ancients had used . The whole should be rich yet simple , in colouring as in form . High-placed windows would concentrate the mind on devotions , for ' That Horror with which a solemn Gloom is apt to fill the Mind naturally raises our venerations , and there is always something of an Austerity in Majesty . . . ' The building should be completed by a dome , and even the ' Composition of the Lines of the Pavement full of musicall and geometrical Proportions ' will echo the perfect harmony of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1755 ) . Beauty is conceived as being the result of a mathematical formula based on reason , in which nothing can be added or taken away without spoiling the whole . One scholar , denying that Alberti was a mere antiquarian , maintains that his passionate concern with the revival of antique forms arises ' from a conviction that the beauties and harmonies of the plastic arts correspond to a moral and spiritual equilibrium of human existence ' .531 As we have seen , Alberti 's ideas on architecture derive partly from his close study of Vitruvius . Although Vitruvius ' text had been // AHDyknown and quoted since Carolingian times , 528 Alberti 's examination is important because he was the first scholar with a good knowledge of antique remains to compare written word with surviving ruins , and to form a system of architecture from that comparison . His interpretation and misinterpretation of the text can stand as an example of the kind of difficulty faced by any scholar who looked to ancient texts for authority . The problem with Vitruvius ' text was the obscurity of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . i ) that , in the field of architecture , Vitruvius was ' the only writer , and without doubt very instructive , to have survived that great shipwreck of Antiquity , but much ravaged by time so that in many places much is missing and , in others , you would wish for a fuller explanation ' . His style was so bad , Alberti complained , that ' the Latins thought he wrote Greek and the Greeks believed he spoke Latin . . . ' Such obscurity meant , of course , that the commentator could read almost what sense he liked into the Vitruvian text and still , as it were , receive the blessing of Antiquity . The text must have been illustrated once upon a time , but no manuscript with illustrations survived . The scholar 's Rouen 1648 . This figure is similar to that in Vitruvius for ideal city plans , and to the well-known Renaissance scheme of the man within the circle as a measure of all things . It is another example of an obsession with the centralized plan . task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparing his words with the visible remains of Antiquity . ( Fra Giocondo , who edited Vitruvius in 1511 , may have similarly clarified Vitruvius ' account of town planning by referring to what he could see on the ground. ) 532 It is no surprise to find that Alberti sometimes made mistakes , as with Vitruvius ' account of the Etruscan Temple.536 Vitruvius describes a temple type with three cellae at the rear of the site and a portico taking up half its area . Actual examples of that form have now been uncovered , but Alberti knew nothing so strange . And so , in the De re aedificatoria , he describes the nearest thing he knows that will fit Vitruvius ' description ? a miniature version of the Basilica of Maxentius , which , indeed , was believed throughout the Renaissance to be the remains of a temple . Unconstrained by Vitruvius ' neglect of centrally planned temples , Alberti makes his own specification for the form : such structures must , he writes , have a portico leading to a room which must be vaulted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He obviously studied buildings like the Pantheon and the Temple of Vesta at Tivoli , 130 but for the more complicated apse and chapel shapes that he prescribes Alberti must have closely examined the mausolea in and around the City of Rome . Krautheimer forges another link between temple and mausoleum by suggesting that the widespread Renaissance belief that antique gods were great men made immortal ( euhemerism ) may have made it clear to Alberti that such small buildings , precisely because they contained tombs , were in fact temples as well , raised to the glory of the newly created god . The same duality would , in Alberti 's eyes , apply to Early Christian centrally planned buildings such as the Mausoleum of Theodoric at Ravenna , or S. Costanza in Rome . Whatever the quibbles , Alberti it was who resurrected and interpreted Vitruvius for the Renaissance . He was also the first modern architect to pay thorough attention to the Orders of classical architecture , 526 ' 54o although he was never sufficiently interested in architecture as structure to conceive of the Orders as anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not essential loadbearing elements . Nevertheless , it was his interest in the Orders , combined with his study of antique remains , which led him to propose two solutions , both of which have been extensively used , to the problem of how to make a Christian building look suitably antique . His church designs are therefore of crucial importance in the history of architecture . He began with the remodelling of the old church of S. Francesco at Rimini ( begun 1450 ) , where he hit on the idea of using a triumphal arch on a high podium for the facade : the one large opening and two small openings could then correspond with the entries to the nave and aisles . Sometimes , however , the aisles of a church are very much lower than the nave ; at S. Maria Novella , Florence ( begun 1458 ) he solved the awkward connection between nave ? facade and aisle ? facade by joining them with elegant scrolls , another feature which established a tradition in church architecture . S. Francesco at Rimini is more commonly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed for the tyrant of Rimini , Sigismondo ALBERTI , ARCHITtECT AND SCHOLAR Malatesta , as a memorial to himself and his humanist court . It is indeed a temple ? almost a temple of fame.542 The imagery of the complex scheme , quite possibly worked out by Alberti himself , is replete with classical references , being a Neoplatonic monument to Sigismondo 's ' own apotheosis as a sungod ' 539,543 This pantheon has sarcophagi ( containing members of his court ) in the outside walls under arched openings which , in their articulation , derive from Roman aqueduct design , or a simplified Colosseum . The crossing was to have been completed by a dome , which would probably have resembled that of the Pantheon in Rome . The implications of the whole scheme must have shocked the Church : Pius II publicly excommunicated Sigismondo for his presumptuous vainglory . Yet the idea of the building bore fruit in future centuries , as in the Pantheon in Paris or the Walhalla at Regensburg . An alternative to the triumphal arch , conveniently used to express Christian beliefs of resurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to use in church design , in his much altered S. Sebastiano , Mantua ( begun 1460 ) . Alberti 's own design , as reconstructed by Wittkower , shows a high podium bearing a Greek-cross church , whose facade has its austerity modified by a broken pediment from CLASSICISM IN ITALIAN ARCHITECTURE . which is suspended a window . A precedent for this arrangement was the triumphal arch at Orange , in Provence. * Neither S. Sebastiano nor the facades of S. Andrea at Mantua ( begun 1470 ) , which give a better idea of Alberti 's intentions , make any use of full columns ; both use a wall architecture of pilasters . At S. Andrea , the facade motif of a massive wall pierced by a barrel vault is increased in majesty by the giant pilasters which , rising apparently through three storeys , frame the exact square of the facade , and divide it into four exact and smaller squares . Inside the church , the same facade motif is continued down the aisle-less nave in the chapels to left and right , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never before , in form or decoration , had the grandeur of ancient Rome been so potently evoked . It was works such as S. Andrea that were strongly to affect Bramante 's conception of ancient Rome , which was , for him , as much the Rome of the great baths as the Rome of the little temples and mausolea . Unlike Brunelleschi , Alberti throws over delicacy in favour of strength , and sacrifices Brunelleschi 's light arcading for the massiveness of barrel vault and pillars . It is essentially in a structure like S. Andrea that the Plato and Aristotle of Raphael 's School of Athens hold sway , when their philosophy is magnified by the very scale of the architecture . In De re aedificatoria ( VII . ii ) , Alberti prescribed the vault as an essential element of the temple : the dome , as in S. Sebastiano and as projected for the Tempio Malatestiano , is a variation on the vault . Alberti was an expatriate Florentine , and left examples of his architecture in Rome as well as in Rimini and Mantua . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he founded a type of palace facade with his Palazzo Rucellai ( begun 1446 ) , a building which applies the Orders , as pilasters , to its facade , and divides the three storeys horizontally and mathematically by bold entablatures . Later palaces owe much to this example : the Palazzo Pitti ( begun 1485 ) , unusual in its monumental scale , might even be by Alberti himself , while the Palazzo Gondi ( Giuliano da Sangallo , begun c. 1490 ) and the Palazzo Strozzi ( begun 1489 ) take the easier course of no Orders , deriving their manner from Michelozzo 's Palazzo Medici ( begun 1444 ) . The great breadth of Alberti 's ideas on architecture and townplanning545 bears fruit in the work of Bernardo Rossellino , whose ideal city of Pienza , the birthplace of Pius II ( Enea Silvio Piccolomini ) , was actually in part built ( 1460-2 ) . The Palazzo Piccolomini there is a variation on the Palazzo Rucellai , which Rossellino had in fact helped to build . The various buildings of Pienza are arranged almost as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design could be completed . Then again , Alberti also provided the first barrel vault in Florence , in the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre within the church of S. Pancrazio ( c. 1455-60 ) . Alberti was not what we would call today a ' professional ' architect , and presumably he did not take students . But the career of Giuliano da Sangallo ( 1443-1516 ) , a Florentine architect , demonstrates the spread of Alberti 's // ideas . Giuliano was apparently the first Florentine architect to receive a thorough training in Rome ; he arrived there in 1465 , and worked until at least 1472 . Some of his earlier designs ? for example , La Madonna delle Carceri , Prato ( begun 1484 ) ? are an extension of the manner of Brunelleschi , but his mature work benefits from his study of antique Roman architecture . Such is the case with his villa for Lorenzo de ' Medici at Poggio a Caiano , near Florence ( begun c. 1482 ) , and with his Palazzo della Rovere at Savona , of the next decade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his sketch-books ( including one for an immense palace for the King of Naples ) , Giuliano 's confident use of antique Roman forms becomes even clearer . Poggio , for example , is probably the first villa where a Roman temple portico is introduced , albeit recessed ; the salone displays a coffered barrel vault designed and constructed after the manner of the antique . The Naples project has a portico standing proud of the block , and is completely unlike any Florentine scheme ; its whole organization is Roman , and shows a concern for balance and mathematical division which Palladio , drawing on similar sources , used in the next century . On the Palazzo della Rovere , furthermore , Giuliano takes up the classical Orders , and applies them , as Alberti did , as pilasters to the austere facade . In the Palazzo Scala , in Rome ( 1472/80 ) , Giuliano attempted to recreate an antique palace , complete with reliefs in a totally antique manner . He might therefore be called a link between the delicate Florentine manner of Brunelleschi and , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Renaissance in Rome . // Leonardo and Bramante : the High Renaissance in architecture Another link between Alberti and the High Renaissance is forged by the extraordinary treatise of Antonio Filarete ( 1461/4 ) . This not only copies parts of Alberti 's De re aedificatoria ( which was not printed until 1485 , in Florence ) , but also adds an immense disquisition on an ideal city called Sforzinda , named after his Milanese patron Francesco Sforza ( he had arrived there from Rome by 1456 ) . The book is important because Filarete 's enthusiasm for classical antiquity and his dismissal of the ' modern ' style no doubt affected the outlook of both Leonardo and Bramante , both of whom lived for a time in Milan , the former from 1482 to 1499 , the latter from 1481 to 1499 . Leonardo is certainly a crucial figure in the development of Bramante 's art , but the extent of his actual involvement with real buildings is unclear.551553 Leonardo drew centrally planned churches in his notebooks ; these Leonardo da Vinci , drawings of central-plan churches . Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brunelleschi , particularly the cathedral dome and the S. Maria degli Angeli project , and Giuliano da Sangallo 's sacristy for S. Spirito . Furthermore , we know that Leonardo took an interest in ancient ruins : he describes an antique temple in the Codex Atlanticus ( fol. 285 ) and from the anonymous Codex Bramantinianus it is certain that he possessed a book containing drawings of ancient buildings ( which he might have drawn himself ) . Several links have been suggested between Leonardo and Bramante . They were , of course , working in Milan near each other , the one on the Last Supper , the other on the fabric of the same church and convent of S. Maria delle Grazie . Pedretti has recently shown that among Leonardo 's drawings are details of the Grazie , and he has concluded that Leonardo took an active part in the actual process of design.555 Leonardo 's proven interest in engineering problems makes the suggestion convincing , for he could have offered his friend much help in an area where subsequent events showed Bramante to be woefully inadequate ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter 's ) . The same scholar has even suggested that , because of his centrally planned church designs , Leonardo might well have had a hand in the design of the Tempietto in Rome , which is now dated as post-1510.554 The supposition is supported by the close friendship of the two men , revealed by the Antiquarie Prospetiche Romane , dedicated to Leonardo , of which Bramante seems to have been the author.547 But it is possible to argue the matter the other way , as Heydenreich does , stating that Leonardo ' derived the values of ancient monumentality through the classic style of Bramante .548 Bramante 's architectural education must have begun in his home town of Urbino , where he would have seen the marvellous and sober buildings in the frescoes and panels of Piero della Francesca . We can assume that , on his way to Milan , he would have passed through Mantua , and admired the works of Alberti . Once in Milan , his manner shows connections with the spirit of Alberti 's work . // Bramante 's only centrally planned building in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church of S. Maria presso S. Satiro ( where he also worked ) . His inspiration here was the original foundation of S. Satiro , a ninthcentury structure based on Early Christian examples , which it was his task to remodel . The ground-plan of the medieval church appealed to him , and he adapted it for his sacristy to the same church ( 1470 ? c.1482 ) . As for the exterior elevation of S. Satiro , the clarity with which he indicates the cross-within-the-circle is completely Florentine , whilst the pilasterand-niche motif probably derives from Brunelleschi 's S. Maria degli Angeli . He was to use it again when he went to Rome . Equally significant in Bramante 's search for an antique style is his interior modelling of S. Maria presso S. Satiro . The trick perspective of the apse ( he lacked the space for anything other than an illusion ) is less important than the massive barrel vault which weighs down upon it and echoes the vaulting of the nave . The articulation of S. Maria , with its use of . Rome , Cloister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilasters and great pillars , is in the tradition of Alberti 's S. Andrea at Mantua . And the architectural detailing of this beautiful church reveals a close study by Bramante of the Early Christian architecture in which Milan then abounded . But the greatest similarity with Alberti 's style is shown in the tribune of S. Maria delle Grazie , which is very close in style to S. Sebastiano at Mantua . Not only is the Milanese work in effect a centrally planned design ; a comparison may also be made with the Tempio Malatestiano at Rimini , since the tribune was intended as a mausoleum , in this case for the Sforza family . This links the building not only with Alberti and with antique prototypes , but also with Leonardo 's projects for a Sforza mausoleum.549 In 1499 Milan fell to the French , and Bramante moved to Rome where , after making the cloister of S. Maria della Pace ( finished 1504 ) , he designed the Tempietto55o55e at S. Pietro in Montorio , the original design of which is preserved in Serlio 's woodcut . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEFT Colosseum , Rome . A general and essential source for Bramante 's elements of architecture , and in particular for his cloister at S. Maria della Pace . which , also with columns and niches , echoes the structure itself , and provides a clear demonstration of Bramante 's concern with geometry . The scheme is similar in plan to the Early Christian church of S. Lorenzo , Milan , which Bramante would have known well . The columns of the Tempietto actually are antique ; Bramante combines them with detailing and forms of his own invention to make a building inspired by antique temples and , in its proportions , by a basically Greek notion of geometry . Yet in spite of these derivations it remains wholly original . The Tempietto as we see it today is not as Bramante designed it : the dome has been heightened from the original halfsphere , and the air of blank-eyed austerity would perhaps have been mitigated by statues in the niches . This small temple was to assume great significance during the Renaissance , for it was considered the equal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Quattro Libri dell'Architettura ( 1570 ) refers to Bramante as the man who was the first ' to bring back into the light of day the good and beautiful architecture that had been hidden since the time of the ancients ' . He , like Serlio before him , therefore includes the Tempietto among his accounts and illustrations of antique buildings . His ground plan is different from Serlio 's ; he makes the temple look more like the mausolea or Christian martyria from which it is derived . Palladio himself was a great sketcher of ancient ruins , so perhaps this is an example of wishful thinking . The Tempietto had presented a relatively simple problem which could be solved by recourse to the readily available formal sources , ranging from Early Christian martyria to the rooms of Roman palaces like the Domus Aurea or Hadrian 's Villa , and the numerous tombs and nymphaea scattered around the Campagna . But when , in 1503 , Bramante was asked to design a new church of St Peter to replace the Early Christian basilica , problems abounded.552 Old St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long nave , which made Bramante 's choice of a central . 137 . plan all the more likely . His idea , known from a drawing in the Uffizi , was to incorporate a Greek cross within a square , and to divide the interior symmetrically into a series of smaller , centrally planned areas . The entrances were to be through columned porticoes on each of the four sides of the square , and , as the foundation medal by Caradosso of 1506 shows , a tower at each corner would have set off the semicircular dome . It was the dome which was to cause the trouble . Bramante intended to support it on a drum decorated by columns , to build it up in ' steps ' like the Pantheon dome , and then to crown it with a lantern . But Bramante 's inexperience of work on such a huge scale necessitated his considerably enlarging and strengthening the supporting piers at the crossing . After his death in 1514 , when Raphael took over , it was suggested that the central plan should be abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Latin cross were put forward , all of which had to incorporate the great piers for the crossing , which had already been built . Had Bramante 's first project been completed , how antique would it have looked ? * The answer must lie in the relation of the dome . to the four facades , and the only evidence we have for this is the foundation medal mentioned above . This , like some of the designs by Leonardo which surely influenced Bramante 's conception , shows a set of four porticoes reaching to drum level , with the transition to the lower entrance porticoes being made by four smaller domes , each on its own drum , all providing an echo of the much larger central dome . Also , of course , the antique intention of the structure would have been made clear by its purpose : to shelter the tomb of St Peter ( let alone that of Julius II ! ) ? in other words , to act as a gigantic martyrium . It is impossible to tell whether Bramante 's facades would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls predominate , and nothing fights for attention with the dome . This was to have been a single-shell dome , like the Pantheon ; a double-shell in the Brunelleschi manner would have been much lighter . But whereas the Pantheon was supported to ground level by its thick walls , Bramante tried to maintain his dome on four piers , and misjudged his calculations . Some idea of how Bramante 's St Peter 's might have looked , but with a double-shell , not a saucer dome , can be 138 . gained from the two churches obviously modelled upon it . S. Maria della Consolazione at Todi , by Cola da Caprarola ( and others , begun 1508 ) , has similar giant pilasters on the piers supporting the dome , and looks even more like one of Leonardo 's sketches . La Madonna di S. Biagio , at Montepulciano , by Antonio da Sangallo the Elder ( begun 1518 ) , is more impressive because in it a much bolder use is made of the classical Orders and therefore the work achieves an impression of antique weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is elegant rather than strong . La Madonna di S. Biagio , although built to a Greek cross plan , is directional : two towers , only one of which was completed , were to flank the main entrance . They are similar in design to those on the Caradosso medal , fully articulated by the Orders , and welded into the facade storey by storey , which presumably would have happened at St Peter 's too . In fact , La Madonna di S. Biagio might represent a slightly later stage of work on St Peter 's , namely the period when Raphael was in charge and produced a model ( now lost ) , plans and elevations . It is interesting to note that Antonio 's son worked on the fabric from 1516 to 1520 , under Raphael . Basically , Raphael 's design changed St Peter 's permanently from a Greek-cross martyrium into a nave church adapted for processions . A drawing by Raphael shows that the facade was intended to have a two-storeyed portico , the storeys linked by a giant Order ( to echo the piers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This would have been the exact height of the barrelvaulted nave , itself graced by giant pilasters . To such elements , evidently inspired by Alberti 's S. Andrea at Mantua , Raphael added flanking towers of a festive nature , articulated by the Orders and decorated by niches and swags . // Mannerism The scale of St Peter 's is indicative of the tendency toward much larger buildings both civil and religious during the sixteenth century . A different architectural vocabulary from that perfected by Bramante in the Ternpietto was required in order to cope with the increased scale of construction . This alone , however , can not begin to account for the development of ' Mannerism ' in architecture , which can best be understood as a reaction to the elements of classicism as erected in the High Renaissance canon . Basing themselves on the example of Antiquity , architects like Alberti and Bramante had evolved a structural system which was rational , calm and dignified : columns supported entablatures , the design of window openings was consistent with antique practice , and the whole system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such men , was a pleasure for the mind , which could delight in both the calm perfection of its mathematics and the associations it evoked . By contrast the Mannerist architects , particularly Giulio Romano and Michelangelo , looked to Antiquity not as the seat of all 140 authority but rather as a vast mine of examples which could be drawn upon to satisfy an approach to art which is emotional , not rational . Nevertheless , it is obvious that Mannerism is a development of High Renaissance classicism , and in order to appreciate the effects at which the Mannerists aim , a knowledge of the syntax of classicism is essential . Giulio Romano 's buildings create an impression of emotional instability and capriciousness only because of this underlying contrast with classicism , and we can therefore say that they play on the notion of classical order and reason for their effect . All Giulio 's important architectural works ? he was also Raphael 's chief assistant in painting ? are in Mantua , where he ruled as architect , designer and painter from 1524 until his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c. 1540 ) which , like the Cortile della Cavallerizza of the Palazzo Ducale ( c. 1539 ) breaks all the rules of classicism . But the most amazing achievement was the Palazzo del Te , a villa on the outskirts of Mantua for which Giulio was almost totally responsible : it is filled with his frescoes , some of which are pseudo-antique , others shockingly illusionistic . As with all Mannerist creations , at the . Palazzo del Te the total effect is one of unease and confusion . The eye is frequently made to doubt what it is in fact seeing , and nowhere more so than in the courtyard where the deviations from the classical canon are quite deliberate . For a start , none of the four sides match , nor do they appear to be completely finished , thanks to Giulio 's startling use of heavy , rusticated blocks in contrast with expanses of smooth blocks . Occasionally , stones of the architrave have slipped and left gaps in the frieze , where the triglyphs have slipped as well . Strangest of all is the section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entablature , and a lower Order bearing the pediment over the central opening : the point of the pediment struggles for room and the supporting columns teeter in the midst of their more robust fellows . Michelangelo 's desire for emotional force is as great as Giulio 's , but his greater inventiveness assures his work of a larger impact . The work of both men was extensively imitated : Mantua , that antiquarian paradise , was much visited until the fall of the House of Gonzaga , but Michelangelo 's buildings were easily accessible in Florence and Rome . The New Sacristy of S. Lorenzo , Florence ( the Medici Chapel , begun 1519 ) and the vestibule of the Laurentian Library attached to the same church ( begun 1525 ) present the epitome of Michelangelo 's maltreatment of classicism for expressive ends . Instead of making the library vestibule a light and airy room he presents the visitor with a combination of antique elements , all altered , which are almost threatening because of the way in which they are combined . The staircase ( by Ammanati after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with steps . But it is the wall architecture which is so strange , principally because the exact level of the wall surface and the relation of the columns set within it to that surface can not be worked out by logic or by eye alone. * If the columns support the entablature , why are they recessed into the wall and themselves supported only on gigantic volutes , which never knew this task in Antiquity ? If they do not , why does the thick wall between them support nothing other than the evidently paper-thin area of the windowopenings ? This system of solid above void and void above solid is contrary to reason , particularly when everything described , except those volutes , is far above the head of the spectator , who can find nothing of human scale with which to relate . Essentially the same effect is created in the Medici Chapel : architectural elements lead a wilful life of their own , pushing and squeezing . A comparison with the Old Sacristy , by Brunelleschi , demonstrates the wilful misuse of the vocabulary of classical architecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the villain of the piece . Certainly , the attitude to the ' correct ' use of classical elements was never the same again , but it is equally true to say that Michelangelo broadened the emotional vocabulary and thereby extended the life-span of the classical language of architecture . One device he invented was widely used in succeeding generations : the giant pilaster . In his redesigning of the Capitoline Hill ( perhaps begun 1539 ) , Michelangelo wished to give a unity to the piazza , and attained this by endowing the facing Palazzo del Senatore and Palazzo dei Conservatori with identical facades . Crowned by a balustrade , and including a loggia at ground level , the two-storeyed buildings are articulated by the Corinthian Order , but , unlike any secular building hitherto erected , these palaces have their storeys united by a giant Order which supports the imposing entablature . The ground storey has its own scaled Order as well . Although some triumphal arches use a similar scheme , nothing quite like this had been built in Antiquity ; however , Alberti 's S. Andrea at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar solution . In other words , Michelangelo solved the problem of linking two or more storeys without recourse to the usual ' Colosseum ' solution of using one Order per storey , each with its own apparatus . The solution provides a new way of balancing horizontals and verticals , but represents a totally new departure in scale and monumentality . This can best be seen by comparing Bramante 's plan for the new St Peter 's with the design of Michelangelo ( 1546 ) ; while adhering to Bramante 's general scheme , Michelangelo greatly increased the size of the supports for the dome , and added a portico with giant columns , and a giant Order of Corinthian pilasters both inside and outside . It is at this point that problems of nomenclature intervene to demonstrate that ' Mannerism ' , while possibly a suitable concept in . 142 . painting , has little to recommend it in architecture , unless we understand it as simply a different approach to Antiquity . Perhaps the work of Michelangelo , Vignola and Pirro Ligorio founds a new orthodoxy in architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the architect of the Palazzo Farnese at Caprarola ( begun 1559 ) , the Villa di Papa Giulio ( begun 1551 ) and the church of the Gesu ( begun 1568 ) , but also the author of the Regola delle Cinque Ordini ( 1562 ) which , as he says in the preface to this collection of illustrations , is derived from his examination of antique architecture . Pirro Ligorio , builder of the Villa d'Este ( c. 1565 ? 72 ) and the Casino di Pio IV in the Vatican ( begun 1559 ) , would also have been outraged had anyone told him that he was mangling the very spirit of antique architecture . He would have pointed to his painstaking study of Antiquity , and shown how his own work depended on it . Nomenclature is also difficult for seventeenthcentury Italian architecture : in painting , it is easy to make a precise distinction between Mannerist and Baroque , but such is not the case with , for example , the standard comparison between the facade of Vignola 's Gesu and Carlo Maderno 's S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences are only of degree , not of type . The Gesu facade , in the ordering of its constituent parts , begins a tradition at least as important as Alberti 's Tempio Malatestiano , which we shall meet again not only in seventeenth-century Rome , but also in Paris , particularly in Francois Mansart 's Val de Grace ( begun 1645 ) . Or , to be more accurate , the Gesu restates a theme initiated by Alberti 's S. Andrea at Mantua , both in its facade and in the arrangement of the interior . Palladio Perhaps the best way of underlining the fact that the classical tradition in architecture is both more continuous and , indeed , more longlived than it is in either painting or sculpture is to study the career of Andrea Palladio . The facade of the Redentore , Venice ( begun 1576 ) , 558 a mature work , is clearly an extension of the temple-front idea of Alberti , but , equally clearly , the multiplication of pediments one behind the other produces an excitement and 144 effects of light and shade which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moulds the space of his white vaults by techniques derived from his study of the great Roman baths ; the screen of columns in the chancel , half-revealing a room beyond , are from the same source . Palladio uses walls as the Romans of the Empire used them , as elements to be gouged out by arches and niches , and decorated by columns and pilasters . Undeniably , therefore , ancient Rome is the very foundation of his architectural vocabulary , enhanced by a good knowledge of his Renaissance forebears.560 Balancing the splendour of Palladio 's forms is another quality which is the main reason for his great popularity , and for the ease and frequency with which he was imitated : mathematical clarity in both plan and elevation , stemming from the Renaissance belief that beauty could be attained through the use of geometry and measurement . His fame was spread by his textbooks . Le Antichita di Roma ( 1554 ) was to become the most popular of all guides to the antiquities of the city . His illustrations to Daniele Barbaro 's edition with commentary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Above all , his own I Quattro Libri dell ' Architettura ( 1570 ) , the most popular of all architectural treatises except Vitruvius ' , constantly reminds the reader that the author 's own buildings were largely intended as reconstructions of antique architecture , based on his reading of the Vitruvian text . Such an avowal was obviously good publicity , perhaps not to be taken too seriously ; but Palladio does find authority for his multi-pedimented facade to the Redentore in Vitruvius ' description of his own basilica design at Fano , which refers to the ' double arrangement of gables ' . His villas , the most influential part of his work , also use the temple front , because Palladio believed that this was also a feature of antique domestic architecture . As well as worshipping in antique temples , the classically minded intelligentsia of Europe could henceforth live in them as well , choosing the variation which pleased them most from the great range of alternatives illustrated in I Quattro Libri . How far Palladio based his villas on actual classical remains is not clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , well fitted to be the centre of a farm , and 145 Elevation and section , and plan BELOW of the Villa Rotonda by Palladio , from his I Quattro Libri. capable of adaptation by the landed gentry of northern Europe , particularly those of eighteenth-century England , after the emotionalism of his typically Venetian effects of light and shade had been chastened . Much of Palladio 's early manner depends on the achievements of the High Renaissance in Rome . The palace type represented by Bramante 's House of Raphael ( after 1510 ) is manifestly the source for Palladio 's Palazzo Porta Colleoni in Vicenza ( c. 1550 ) . His church facades are in the same tradition , partly because they go back to Vitruvius and to the Pantheon ( which also has intersecting pediments ) . True , he sometimes does violence to correct classical usage ( the eighteenth-century critic Francesco Milizia wrote of his work as ' bizarre ' and of ' impure taste ' ) , 557 but the exuberance of some of his motifs is less important than his general feeling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational , which obeyed rules : if a work is created according to rules , it can be imitated and taught , assuming that the same basic precepts are imparted . This I Quattro Libri did for classicizing Europe . Palladio 's feeling for clarity is boldly in evidence in some of his earlier buildings , like the Villa Godi , where he // dispenses completely with antique details , and can not therefore rely on their cosmetic qualities . With most of his structures , we can strip away the Orders and their accessories in the mind 's eye , and produce an armature very similar to some of the buildings of the Neoclassical period . That such a process is possible demonstrates the classicism of Palladio 's style . His later work , following his visit to Rome in 1554 when he would surely have learned of Michelangelo 's project for the Capitol , becomes much more monumental . the giant half-column or pilaster is now used , following Michelangelo 's example , as at Vicenza in the Palazzo Valmarana ( 1566 ) or the Loggia del Capitanio ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which Palladio covers the whole design is deliberately reminiscent of a triumphal arch , for the building was intended as a symbol of victory against the Turk . Even more powerful is the Palazzo Thiene in Vicenza ( facade 1556 ? 8 ) where he used the favourite motif of Giulio Romano ( whose work he must greatly have admired ) , namely the rusticated base pierced by plain windows . On the piano nobile , the windows are articulated by great projecting blocks of semi-hewn stone which almost mask the architectural frame of colonettes and pediment . The whole composition , held down by a powerful cornice , has much greater power than , for example , his casing of the Basilica in Vicenza ( 1546/9 ) which , with its succession of ' palladian ' windows ( actually invented by Bramante and popularized by Sansovino in Venice , and by Serlio 's book ) , is much lighter and less imposing . We might say that the Palazzo Thiene is more personal and hence less imitable , at least as far as palaces are concerned , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically urban in intention ; they have to be surrounded by other buildings to give them scale . A hundred years later , we find Bernini proposing a design for the rebuilding of the Louvre ( the ' First Design ' ) which clearly has close connections with the Loggia del Capitanio , just as his piazza for St Peter 's has touches of Palladio in its light and movement.559 With the coming of the seventeenth century and architects like Maderno , Borromini , Bernini and Rainaldi , this chapter of Italian classicism draws to a close . Classicism ? simple , measured , intellectual ? gives way in the seventeenth century to the Baroque , a style which is exuberant , expansive and sensuous . As I have already emphasized , it is not , for all that , estranged from the example of Antiquity . Antiquity is modelled by each age after its own image , and to follow the classical tradition in architecture we must pass to France ( pp. 177ff. , below ) , whose artists and architects , at the end of the sixteenth century and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the High Renaissance in Italy , and adopt and develop it into a national style of their own . 8 The Classical Revival in Seventeenth-Century Italy The Carracci Although Mannerism may have begun as an extension of elements of the High Renaissance style , it atrophied during the later sixteenth century into a repetition of formulae . Complex in composition , colour and meaning , strange in lighting and extreme in bodily contortion , in expression and psychological tenor , Mannerism was a style for courtiers and sophisticates , blatantly clever , and far removed from the naturalistic simplicity and clearheaded idealism of the Stanza della Segnatura . At the end of the sixteenth century Annibale Carracci of Bologna , aided by his brother Agostino and their cousin Lodovico , began to develop a style based on the High Renaissance achievement , and not on contemporary trends . From his own lifetime , Annibale was considered to be the man who placed painting back on the true path of the classical tradition . His works , and those of his followers , particularly Domenichino , Guido Reni and Guercino , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Roman High Renaissance , and their style was consequently a new one . Annibale visited Parma and Venice in about 1585/6 , and in Parma discovered in Correggio a master of forceful yet graceful compositions , of poses and expressions touched not by maniera but by a sweetness which made their idealism more human and hence approachable . Above all , Correggio 's forms were simple and natural , executed with an attractive sfumato derived from Leonardo , and his subject-matter was clear and inviting . Annibale had in fact been experimenting with and extracting from Correggio 's work as early as c. 1583 , at a time . when other Bolognese artists were still looking to Roman Mannerism . Annibale 's visit to Venice introduced him to nobler counterparts of Correggio , for there he studied Titian and Veronese , and saw in them a coloristic and more naturalistic alternative to the art of Raphael , all the more impressive because it was ' alive , vigorous and varied ' , His brother Agostino had already visited Venice in 1582 , and made prints after Tintoretto and Veronese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vasari , who gave it slighting treatment.561 ' 568 ' 572 During these years , Annibale was studying under his cousin Lodovico , from whom he probably took his interest in Correggio ? an interest which Lodovico 's Madonna dei Bargellini ( Bologna , 1588 ) or his Virgin and Child with St Joseph and St Francis ( Cento , 1591 ) show . But Annibale 's own visit to Venice taught him how to paint textures with a shimmering brilliance derived from the technique of Veronese and Titian of dragging a loaded brush across canvas . He learned how to adapt Veronese 's compositions and figure types , as in his Madonna of St Matthew in Dresden ( 1588 ) which is inspired by Veronese 's Marriage of St Catherine in the Accademia in Venice ( late 1570s ) . He could also paint mythologies in the manner of Titian , for example his Venus and a Satyr in the Uffizi ( c. 1588 ) . After the manner of the age , the Carracci founded a school of art in Bologna in about 1582 . This , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had set out on the road , i.e. to good art ) , largely avoided theory and the usual academic programme of instruction . Its students drew from the living model in a variety of formal and informal poses , not from casts . Teachers and students therefore never lost sight of how a body really looks and 149 . moves , and such knowledge was to be of great importance in tempering their encounters with High Renaissance examples . In 1595 , Annibale Carracci was called to Rome to work for Cardinal Odoardo Farnese , who had recently inherited the collection of antiquities formed by his uncle , Cardinal Alessandro Farnese , who had died in 1589 . He desired painted decorations for the Palazzo Farnese which would harmonize with its population of antique statues . The first room Annibale frescoed , the Camerino Farnese , 566 was given an oil painting in the centre of the vault , The Choice of Hercules ( now in Naples ; copy substituted ) , with frescoes of Ulysses , Perseus , Hercules and the Catanian Brothers , all of which illustrated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and white coffering , the interstices of which were filled with grisailles in imitation of stucco . The source for these is Mantegna 's Camera degli Sposi , and Correggio 's Camera di S. Paolo in Parma . The canvas of Hercules at the Crossroads shows the hero , his pose derived from an antique coin , choosing between Virtue and Voluptas , the one facing out of , the other into . the composition . Their poses echo each other , but whereas Virtue , dressed in deep red over blue , the garments falling in solemn folds aided by the figure 's noble contrapposto , stands firmly on the ground , Voluptas is as unsteady as her nature . Her imbalance is accentuated by the insubstantial fluttering veils which partly cover her body . The concepts which these allegories embody are clearly stated in attributes to left and right of the foreground , and echoed in the stony path against the luscious vinous grove of the background . A similar clarity of presentation is to be seen in earlier works by Annibale , but the noble monumentality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of his first-hand knowledge of Raphael . The same qualities are particularly noticeable in altarpieces painted between 1595 and 1605 , when illness forced him to stop painting . Thus his Christ in Glory with Saints ( c. 1595/7 , Florence , Pitti ) takes up the arrangement of Raphael 's Madonna di Foligno , which is also an ex-voto . However , it is a later Raphael , the maker of the Tapestry Cartoons , who provides him with a model for those eagerly gesticulating figures , 150
