Islam 's March <P> To the Editors : <P> That old refrain about the glory of Islamic contributions to world civilization during the Middle Ages April 16 is getting tiresome . What have they given the world since then ? It does n't wash ! No , the retrogression has been pronounced for 700 years , and your kindness to Islam as a civilizing faith is not warranted by recent events . <P> Myron S. Rudd Cincinnati <P> Just back from living in Egypt , I was very pleasantly surprised by your open-minded , sensitive , even courageous reporting on Islam . I was inspired by what I saw of the Islamic way , a way that allows people to live and let live , apparently secure in the knowledge that Allah is with them and with all others they meet . Suzanne Grenager <P> Lewisherry , Pa . <P> <P> These Islamic countries are still bastions of barbarism , a disgrace to all the civilized values . <P> G.J. Advani Chicago <P> Your coverage is fraught with subtle and blatant misrepresentations . The mistakes amount to heresy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Abdu-Rafiq Na'im Levy Oneonta , N. Y. <P> Edward Said 's article on Orientalism came like a breath of fresh air . It is high time that the American press stopped depicting Muslim Arabs as greedy desert bandits or cold-blooded terrorists . <P> Jim Weaver Athens , Ohio <P> Perhaps the most significant point in the resurgence of the Islamic faith is the corresponding decline in the Christian religions . While leaders of Western churches have pandered to the apparent wishes of a potential membership among its youth , Islam continues to demand strict adherence to its rigorous codes . <P> E. T. Gendron Wantagh , N. Y. <P> You say : " Muslims believe the Ka'ba is the spot where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Ishmael at God 's command . " According to Genesis 22:2 , it was Isaac whom Abraham prepared to sacrifice . Have the Muslims decided that it was Ishmael , not Isaac , whom Abraham prepared to sacrifice ? <P> Mary E. Ferguson Sandy Spring , Md . <P> Yes , according to Islamic tradition . <P> <P> Post-Mortem on Bhutto <P> Innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 will always be in the minds and hearts of the poor people of Pakistan . His positive achievements far outnumber the misdeeds he may have committed . The only popular and nationally recognized political personality ever to emerge after independence is gone . A great leader has been taken away from his people by force . <P> Shamoon S. Habib Irving , Texas <P> It is a sad , mad world all right . So much ballyhoo about the Bhutto hanging . The Pakistani judiciary established his involvement , so why all this rooftop show for Bhutto ? Anyone who will deprive another of his life forfeits the right to live . <P> P. Narendra Menon Bombay <P> That Bhutto is now a part of history is hard to accept . As a Bengali , my shock at his execution was in marked contrast to my feeling toward him during the Bangladesh struggle . Time seems to heal wounds after all . <P> Zakariya Mohyuddin Nashville <P> Raping Rapists <P> If some of our courts see it as fair and just to execute murderers April 16 , then , logically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal from thieves and rape rapists . I ca n't imagine what would be done with pot smokers or pornographers.
