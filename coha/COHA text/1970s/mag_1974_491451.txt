Richard Chamberlain 's Cape Cod cottage stands high above Coldwater Canyon in the unfashionable upper reaches of Beverly Hills . Here , formal , carefully groomed streets give way to scrubby , winding roads , modest , sometimes rundown homes , and one- instead of four-car garages . Chamberlain 's house , like his clothes and his small group of friends , is completely against his star status . Though cynical critics have some-times called him pretentious  --  citing his " British " accent , his extraordinarily ambitious range of starring roles , his appearance in highly artistic stage , screen and television productions  --  he is actually quite devoid of pretense . Subdued , shy , withdrawn , he is the most dedicated of young actors . Not for him the flamboyant emphasis on leather jackets , fast cars , deep-sea fishing , the machismo image of the all-male star , or stalking a heroine like big game . Instead , a sober and modest search for quality , a sense of the vocation of acting that is monastic in its single-mindedness . His dedication has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disparate figures as Hamlet , Cyrano de Bergerac , Richard II , Tchaikovsky , Lord Byron , Edward V111 and Scott Fitzgerald . Chamberlain greets me at the door , dressed in a polka dotted royal blue casual shirt and jeans . His brown hair is still a mass of almost Harpo-ish ringlets and his moustache still curls with a cavalier braggadocio ; he has just finished playing Cyrano de Bergerac at the Los Angeles Music Center . Extremely lean , with slender bones , he gives an impression of delicate , steely strength . His face is aquiline , the face of a natural aristocrat , with slightly slanting pale blue eyes , high hollow cheekbones , a carefully chiseled jawline . It is the face and body of a monk  --  a monk in a working order , dedicated to simple tasks . Chamberlain would he the perfect St. Francis of Assisi . We walk together into the su tail living room . A fire roaring healthily in the grate casts a welcoming glow over the British and American antiques , the polished wooden floor , and the overstuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of highly masculine , dark brown wooden furniture . Built in 1965 by an architect named Jerome Colcord. the house has been extensively remodeled by Chamberlain since he bought it from its first owners . Characteristically , he stripped all the paint off the wood , put in beautiful parquet floors , and is presently re-creating the whole front part of the building . He is making a stained glass window and will extend the rooms several feet so that they will overhang the garden . Chamberlain is putting the same enormous concentration into these reconstructions as he is putting into his acting . He sits in a harp-back chair , kicks his shoes off , and props his feet on the table . Now and again he gets up to pour tea from a silver pot and to serve some delicious home-baked cookies from a large plate . He begins by talking about his London apartment , on Bayswater Road , overlooking Hyde Park : " I 've spent much too much money on it . It 's a super flat , really nice . I have to rent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way I can afford it . My passion for fixing places up has really reached an extreme there I converted one bedroom and hallway into a very large , scrubbed pine dining room . I put a huge skylight in the roof to light the upstairs sitting room . This has a wonderful view of the park ; it was the old servants ' quarters . The whole thin , is done in ' early clutter ' but it 's kind of homey , and nice . In England you can make things cozy and casual ; nobody expects any particular style . Over here everything is ' pure decorator . ' " Chamberlain gives an almost imperceptible shudder . " How could anybody live in anybody else 's selections ? " Aside from toiling on the environments he lives in so that they express his own pure , clear-cut , cool personality , Chambeilain has to take the utmost care of that other house , his body  --  to permit the playing of his enormously taxing roles . " I do n't have a superabundance of energy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally could n't do anything else . When I came home at night I was so up ' that I could n't sleep until three or four in the morning . When 1 do n't get enough rest I have to be especially careful of my health . When I do a matinee I try to sleep in the theater for half an hour before a show . If I go to parties during a run I find I 'm giving less than my best to the performance , which drives me crazy . I hate that feeling of not having quite enough energy and concentration . I exercise very hard . When I get up in the morning I do dance movements , practicing like a ballet dancer at the barre . I stretch , bend , do calisthenics , push-ups , pull-ups . I have to train for my parts like an athlete . " I go to bed at eleven and rise at seven even when I 'm not working . But there still is n't enough time for everything , and that 's frustrating . I keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people like Peter O'Toole and Richard Harris who apparently can just ' play ' all the time , and work , too . I gave up smoking halfway through playing Tchaikovsky in The Music Lovers because I found that cigarettes made my voice kind of raw . I had given up while doing ' Dr. Kildare ' and then started again . It 's much harder to quit the second time around . I drink very rarely . I 'll admit I do occasionally enjoy a ' wet weekend . ' But not when I 'm in a play . I ca n't drink before or after a performance . " Food ? " I 'm heavy on protein . This morning I made a fabulous drink with protein powder and fruit juice . believe in eggs , steak  --  when I 'm on a film i have a steak for breakfast  --  and I like my steak quite rare . I do n't believe in vegetarianism or macrobiotic diets  --  not for me , anyway . I 'm excited by the idea of cottonseed , however . I 've heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to remove a chemical from it which used to interfere with digestion . It 'll be a wonderful thing for people to eat once it 's purified . Of course , I 'll use it all the time . " Born on March 21 , 1935 , the son of a manufacturer of supermarket fixtures , Chamberlain grew up like a typical California boy : rebellious . unscholarly , fond of the sun and the outdoors . He loved tennis , surfing , football . He can not remember exactly when his lifelong passion for romantic literature and drama really began . " I was n't a reader as a child at all . I was a very petulant , horrible child and would n't learn anything . I hated the imposition of being made to learn , by ghastly , horrible women teachers at Beverly Hills High School . Everything was imposed as a painful , necessary discipline . Nobody ever said , ' Look , wow ! If you learn these words it will open up a whole treasure chest of incredible , wonderful things ! ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decoded the secret , that I learned the excitement of Shakespeare and other great writers . " I was so bored with everything as a child I would n't even learn to tie my shoes ! It was n't until I got to Pomona College that I learned the pleasure of study . To this day I hate having discipline imposed on me from the outside . I love to impose discipline on myself . I 'll take direction easily , but it has to be a give and take situation . " Christopher Fry 's The Lady 's Not For Burning , which Chamberlain recently played at the Chichester Festival in England , had provided his first great experience of drama . " In the early 1950 's we got the records at college and prepared a reading . I was enthralled by Fry 's poetry and by the great performance of Pamela Brown . I fell in love at the outset with romantic poetry , romantic literature . " It was some time before Chamberlain could express this passion in a memorable series of romantic roles . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction : he worked sporadically in little theater , as a box boy in supermarkets , as a chauffeur for a crippled woman , and even served for a time as a G.1. in Korea . He landed , miraculously , a contract at MGM , and then got tossed away on the shoals of Secret of the Purple Reef But , wasted though he was , he never stopped training his instruments : his mind , his voice , his body . He took singing and dancing lessons , toiling for months at ballet class . When he landed the title role of " Dr. Kildare , " which made him famous , he already had the basic attributes of a great actor : perfect diction , grace in motion , a profound , searching intelligence in interpretation . " Kildare , " Chamberlain feels , was a fine experience for an actor , though ultimately limiting . " It was like repertory training . I learned to discipline my movements to the confines of sets of large and small offices . I learned every day about film technique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were all important as guides to feeling in a scene , and , incidentally , in those grueling long days , something of what it meant to be a doctor . " We worked forty-seven weeks a year , and I had classes every night . After the third year I tried to make the producers let Kildare ' grow up ' a bit more , become less belligerent and childish , but they would n't change him , and of course they were right . I tried to play the lines differently , and I could n't . Then I knew I had to get out . " Once released from the high-paying jail sentence of " Kildare , " Chamberlain was dangerously adrift . He played summer stock , appeared in the catastrophic musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany 's with Mary Tyler Moore , which closed after four previews on Broadway , and had a role in the financial failure Petulia , in which he sensitively played an angry , sexually impotent husband . Just when it looked as though he was going to sink without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England . It was the single most important act of his life , and at first he was terrified . " I had to break the mold , though . The image of ' Kildare ' was so fixed . Americans did n't want me to change , ever . I brooded over it for months . Finally , I had a hunch : ' Co ! ' And the matter was settled when Eamonn Andrews , who had a show on British TV , offered to pay my fare if I 'd go on his program as a guest . 1 accepted , and I 've never looked back . " Chamberlain 's agent managed to get him the role of the consumptive , romantic hero of Henry James'sPortrait of a Lady in a BBC television serial . He played it brilliantly , displaying the same touchy , neurotic , hypersensitive quality with which he had invested his role in Petutia . " The producer ruled me out completely at first , but I was determined to get the part . I sat down to lunch with him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British ' accent , even though the character was American , I talked him into it . " As a result of his appearance in Portrait of a Lady , Chamberlain was offered a chance to play , of all things , Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre . " Peter Dews , the director , saw me in the series and turned to his wife , saying ' That 's Hamlet . ' She thought he was insane , and so did everybody else . Kildare as Hamlet ! Peter pushed it through his board of directors . He took it on as a challenge . The preparations were an astounding ordeal . I began working with him in New York , where he was directing Hadrian VII , and then I went back to his home in Whitstable , // England , where I worked in a neighbor 's garage . You never heard such screaming , yelling and pounding ! My problem was getting up sufficient power to carry the role . We Americans have no real vocal sustaining force . I learned from Dews the inner tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was adopted by a patroness , Madame von Meek , whom he never actually met , but who was so passionately in love with his music that she would go into rooms after he had left them and taste the food he had left behind . And that at the end he deliberately drank typhus-infected water because he wanted to die the same way his mother had . " I was mesmerized , thrilled by Russell 's description of him and I said yes immediately . I just threw myself into the picture . It was pointless trying to rehearse , the whole mood was too abandoned , too passionate . I started piano lessons the moment I signed the contract . I had to match my fingering to the pianist who dubbed the track . It was rhythm . be eternally grateful . " Things went very badly once we got to Birmingham . I was whispering my way through the lines . 1 was playing it very , very safe and Peter was in despair . Finally he called me up to his office and said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I said , ' I think I can . I think it will come . I do n't know how or when or why . Give me a little longer . ' And then I worked with him in his office after rehearsals . Finally I got the part in run-throughs . ' " I 've never been so panicked in my life as I was on the first night . I was catatonic with fear . I can remember myself screeching because I had no voice . Almost unable to move , I forgot my lines in the very first scene , and then I was so frightened I became psychosomatically deaf and I could n't hear people giving me the cues . The feeling of tension in the audience was awful . I was like a piano wire . I felt everyone was saying ' Gawblimey , it 's Dr. Kildare ! ' Somehow I got through , the notices were fair , and I went on . " Chamberlain achieved more stardom in The Music Lovers , Ken Russell 's extravagantly romantic film biography of Tchaikovsky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling for avirtually complete mastery of the piano , an ability to dance  --  many scenes were balletically mimed  --  and a range which extended from innocent bucolic rapture to agonized despair , nervous breakdown , and the agony of death from typhus . " Ken Russell is a mad , inspiring genius . Mad and had and very , very dangerous . A little boy . Wild and fantastic . I first met him in my agent 's office , with his sandals and his long , gray hair , and his pudgy chest covered in a grubby T-shirt . lie told me about Tchaikovsky and he blew my mind . I had always thought Tchaikovsky was some sweet , delicate creature who wrote pretty little tunes . 1 had no idea he was a homosexual , self-destrucenormously difficult . Then I had to play on a mute piano for the actual scenes . That was weird . The greatest problem was the dialogue . It was awful , painful dialogue , full of formal expositions of the plot . Ken 's genius emerged in the non-dialogue scenes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail the letter , matched exactly to the ' Letter Song ' in Eugene Onegin , the journey of Tchaikovsky and his brother Modeste through the burning harvest fields . " After The Music Lovers Chamberlain made an even more romantic movie , Lady Caroline Lamb , directed by Robert Bolt , in which he played an even more romantic figure : George Gordon , Lord Byron , poet and lover of Lady Caroline . " I felt much closer to him than to Tchaikovsky . Byron could be a most dazzling charmer , warm and witty and wonderfully gregarious and jovial . But he could also be narcissistic , ruthless , cold . 1 remember I was sitting here in my kitchen at the house when Bolt called me from London and asked me if I 'd play the part . I said yes at once . " Bolt told me , ' Byron has a touch of genius , but he 's also a bit cheap . Ile was the first pop star . ' I went to England . I started the role , as 1 do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no reserves at all . And suddenly Robert Bolt got cold feet . He said , ' I want him insolent and hard and cold . Why do n't you play William Lamb , Caroline Lamb 's husband , instead ? ' I told him , ' 1 must do Byron . ' He said , ' All right . ' And gradually I got the savagery , the cruelty Bolt wanted . It was n't easy . " On television , Chamberlain has done " The Woman I Love , " the story of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor , with Faye Dunaway as Wallis Windsor , and " The Last of the Belles , " in which he played F. Scott Fitzgerald , with Blythe Danner as Zelda Fitzgerald . Of the two , he found " The Woman I Love " more rewarding . " The Duke was still alive when I did it , so that was a major problem . I felt a tremendous sense of responsibility to him and to everyone who knew him . I looked at him on newsreels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I would have thought possible . Of course I had always been dazzled by the image of the two of them . But what I had n't understood was that the giving up of a kingdom was n't romantic so much as an expression of discontent with being a king anyway . It seemed so unreal to believe he would give up a kingdom for a love affair . But even when I did understand him , I realized that there was an immense problem in embodying a myth . That may have made my playing a little too tense and stiff . And on top of that we had a very tense TV crew , and the schedules were very tough for me in Hollywood after the slow pace and endless tea breaks of filmmaking in England . " For Richard Chamberlain , the most taxing roles have been Richard II in Jonathan Miller 's production at the Los Angeles Music Center , and his Cyrano de Bergerac under the direction of Joseph Hardy at the same location . " We did Richard 11 first in Seattle-a warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller , who is very brilliant , took over as director , and everything was changed . It was ex-citing but disconcerting : Jonathan had Richard not as a beautiful , tragic figure but as a kind of petulant child . I felt that sort of unsympathetic treatment was n't really fair to the character or the play in the long run . I think it 's far more deeply and convincingly tragic to have a man who 's seeking growth than a man who 's defeated from the outset . " Cyrano de Bergerac , on the other hand , was an exalting experience . Chamberlain loved the thrust , the passion , the wildness of the Rostand play . " The play is Cyrano . A wonderful , fascinating , complex character-immensely lovable . I saw him as a man absolutely bursting with life , with humor , with love . But thwarted because he was so conscious of his huge nose . He could have won Roxane in a second . But he was so terrified of rejection he lost out . He was immensely sexual , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a total sense a man . I 'm crazy about him . " Most recently Chamberlain has played another dashing-if lesser-figure : Aramis in Richard Lester 's new film version of The Three Musketeers . " The new version follows the book very closely , with some added humor . Aramis is fascinating-the ultimate hypocrite , the smoothest operator at court , rather like a French nineteenth-century Milo Minderhinder . I 've known people like that . He was having an affair with the Queen 's sister , and perfectly happy to pick up money from her despite a religious facade . Whenever things go wrong he just becomes a priest for a while , then comes back . I 'm fascinated by people who are dangerous under a foppish exterior , who are n't quite what they seem . ' Operating ' is one of the things I ca n't do ; I 'm completely open , I 'm not slick . Instead , I have a tortoise 's determination . " Plans for the future ? " Well , by the time people read this , I may-at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures ! But seriously , I 'd love to do Dorian Gray . " Richard Chamberlain , looking extremely young , stands up and looks out across the sweeping browns and greens of Coldwater Canyon . " But they 'll have to hurry . Meanwhile , I 'm learning , studying every day . Disciplining myself , training myself . When the next part comes along I 'll be a complete blank . Naked , trained , waiting like an athlete at the start of ' a race , And then the adventure begins . "
