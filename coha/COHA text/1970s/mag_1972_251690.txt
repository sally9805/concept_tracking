ONCE again the earth will tremble for miles around . Once again tongues of flame will spill across Cape Kennedy 's Pad 39A . Once again a mighty rocket will lift into the sky . But , if all goes according to plan , this week 's scheduled blast-off of Apollo 17 will be remarkably different from past launches . It will take place at night , turning dark into daylight at the cape , presenting a fiery spectacle that may be seen by millions of people from Cuba to as far north as the Carolinas . The magnificent display will serve as a fitting farewell not only to the departing astronauts but to the entire Apollo program . For with the launch of Apollo 17 , the U.S. is bringing to an end its exploration of the moon . <P> Historians will have a difficult time explaining the decision to abandon the Apollo program . Having trained the men , perfected the techniques and designed the equipment to explore the earth 's own satellite , having achieved the ability to learn more about man 's place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to press on . Barely three years after the first lunar landing , the nation that made it all possible has turned its thoughts inward and away from space . <P> Three additional manned missions to the moon originally planned by NASA have been canceled for lack of congressional funding and public support . Though the U.S. spent $5.9 billion to develop the complex Apollo system of rockets , the production of Saturn boosters has been halted . The painstakingly assembled team of skilled technicians , engineers and scientists that made Apollo possible is slowly being disbanded . <P> Despite gloom at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston , there are encouraging signs that man 's ability to explore the solar system will not be completely lost . Next year NASA will use one of its surplus Saturns to launch Skylab , a primitive orbital station in which three men will remain in space for up to 56 days . In 1975 a spare Apollo will take part in the greatly publicized linkup with a Soviet Soyuz , an operation that will serve as a gesture of amity between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , in the late 1970s NASA hopes to fly its vaunted space shuttle-a hybrid of spaceship and rocket plane that could ferry men and supplies to orbital launch pads for journeys far beyond the moon . <P> In America and elsewhere , there are those who have branded the moon landings as brazen propaganda ploys or technological stunts . They are prisoners of limited vision who can not comprehend , or do not care , that Neil Armstrong 's step in the lunar dust will be well remembered when most of today 's burning issues have become mere footnotes to history . <P> Yet even those who have pressed hardest for an end to manned space flight so that funds can be diverted to social needs on earth , can not gainsay Apollo 's ultimate value . The dramatic landings on the moon won acclaim and worldwide respect for America in a decade when the U.S. garnered more disapproval and distrust than at any other time in its history .
