When Henry Ford II was feted in Moscow last month , and invited to help build a Soviet truck plant , one unknown factor was what the Nixon Administration 's ultimate attitude would be . Last week Defense Secretary Melvin Laird delivered a blunt answer : " I am against exporting American technology to the Soviet Union while they are sending trucks to North Vietnam . " Ford had already rejected a similar Laird comment as " not only highly misleading , but also a gratuitous attack upon my common sense and patriotism . " Last week , however , at the company 's annual meeting , he unhappily bowed to the Administration and announced that the deal was off . Ford is still considering " other Soviet proposals for technical cooperation " - presumably on less sensitive matters than trucks .
