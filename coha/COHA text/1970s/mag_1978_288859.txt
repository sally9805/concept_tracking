In exchange for cars , oil for the pumps of Sweden " We are leaving the defensive role Wand going on the offensive , " declared Pehr Gyllenhammar , president of Volvo , Sweden 's troubled giant ( 1977 sales : $3.6 billion ) . On that confident note , he announced last week a bold and imaginative reorganization that in one stroke will supply the automaker with urgently needed cash , give Sweden access to North Sea oilfields and bring in Norway as an energetic junior partner in a new binational corporation . The Norwegians , eager to use their oil riches to develop high-technology industries , called Gyllenhammar 's proposal " the deal of the century . " Swedish Prime Minister Thorbjorn Falldin , whose non-Socialist coalition had refused to help Volvo , endorsed the company 's plan for saving itself . <P> Volvo 's troubles are symptomatic of the ills and abuses that are rendering Swedish companies uncompetitive on the world market , yet , despite the advent of a more conservative government , Sweden remains fully committed to the welfare state .

Once noted for well-built , moderately priced autos , Volvo was forced to increase its prices until its top-of-the-line 264GL , at $10,500 , is nearly as expensive as a Cadillac Coupe De Ville . Volvo sales have slumped globally , and last year profits fell 40% , to $79 million . <P> At first Gyllenhammar hoped to beat Swedish inflation by opening an assembly plant in Chesapeake , Va . Volvo 's declining U.S. sales , off 23% since 1975 , forced an indefinite postponement of full-scale production . Next , the young ( 43 ) <P> Volvo chief sought a merger with his smaller but more profitable Swedish rival , Saab-Scania . The engagement was announced , but Saab-Scania became worried about Volvo 's decline and broke it off . After Falldin 's government refused to help , Gyllenhammar secretly turned to Norwegian Premier Odvar Nordli . <P> According to the plan , which still has to be approved by Volvo 's unions and the Norwegian parliament , the present firm will be dissolved and replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and composed of two divisions . The Swedish branch will have 60% of the shares and appoint six directors to the ten-seat board ; the Norwegian wing will own 40% and name four board members .

The Norwegian company , in turn , will take over Volvo 's Penta marine-engine business and build a plant in Norway . Further , the Norwegians will build important components for a new small Volvo for the 1980s.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
