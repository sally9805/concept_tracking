There is a biological time bomb in Maine 's north woods armed with a fuse set to explode it in a month . Awakened by the warming sun , billions of tiny spruce-budworm larvae will hatch and turn into ravenous caterpillars , ready to eat all the needles and buds on spruce and balsam fir , hemlock and tamarack . Before their appetite is sated , the budworms are expected to chew their way through some 6 million acres of conifers . For 3.5 million of those acres-an area larger than Connecticut-this will be the third straight year of defoliation , and even healthy trees can not survive such continuous attack . <P> Descending Clouds . Though the budworm infestation has been a fact of Maine 's forest life for years , it grew to epidemic proportions last July after the caterpillars became moths . In addition to Maine 's native budworms , hordes more were swept southeast on prevailing winds from Canada , where 75 million acres are also infested . " Clouds " of the insects-one measured 64 miles long by 16 miles wide-were tracked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moths landed , they clogged factory ventilators and auto radiators ; their crushed bodies coated highways with a slippery , accident-causing goo ; in some places , people shoveled the bugs off their porches like snow . But most of the moths ended up in the vast forests , where they quietly laid billions and billions of eggs in preparation for this spring 's attack , which promises to be the worst in 56 years . <P> <P> If the trees on the 3.5 million acres are killed , the U.S. will lose enough wood to have built 1.3 million houses or enough paper to have kept 92 million Americans in newspapers , tissues and wrapping for a year . That is not the only potential loss . Maine would be deprived for the 40 years needed for forest regeneration of at least $13.6 million a year in taxes from the forest-products industry . Workers and businesses serving the timber industry could lose another $106 million per year . Beyond that , Maine 's $450 million-a-year tourist industry will suffer ; no campers or hunters will want to go into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budworm , concludes Lester De-Coster , New England regional manager of the American Forest Institute , " man can not afford to lose . " <P> Trouble is , man 's prospects for winning are not very bright . Ever since the use of DDT was banned in 1967 , Maine has had few weapons in its battle against the budworm . Environmentalists have suggested gradually cutting down the spruce and balsam trees to deny the caterpillar its food and replacing them with hardwood varieties immune to attack . But that plan is not practical ; spruce and balsam are best adapted to the north woods and , says Fred Holt , director of Maine 's bureau of forestry , " they always come back when you plant something else . " Biological controls-most notably one that involves spraying the foliage with a solution containing Bacillus thuringiensus , a bacterium that kills only caterpillars-are still too expensive and difficult to apply over a wide area . <P>
