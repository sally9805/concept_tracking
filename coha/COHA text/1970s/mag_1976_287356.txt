When Jimmy Carter assumes the presidency next January , he will have the world as well as the U.S. economy to worry about . According to increasingly concerned economists on both sides of the Atlantic , the outlook for the faltering economic recovery in Europe could be determined by how fast Carter moves to quicken the pace of American business . These experts fear that unless the U.S. helps to speed up sluggish global growth by adopting a more stimulative course soon , the entire industrialized world could fall into another recession . Such a downturn could well be hastened if , as expected , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries boosts the world price of oil by 10% or more next month . <P> Last week 16 American , European and Japanese economists , meeting at Washington 's Brookings Institution , called on the world 's three economic heavyweights-the U.S. , Germany and Japan-to adopt more expansive policies , such as tax cuts and increased government spending . A failure to get the major economies moving again , the experts indicated , could dangerously increase social and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Britain , Italy and , to a lesser degree , France . Moreover , almost all economists agree that a slump in Europe would be bad news for the U.S. Says Lawrence Klein , President-elect Carter 's chief economic adviser : " What really scares me is signs of a worldwide slowdown at a time when the economies of the West have become increasingly synchronized . " <P> All this marks a sharp reversal in economic thinking . Only last June , Western politicians , led by the Ford Administration , were enthusiastically endorsing moderate growth policies aimed at beating inflation . But only the U.S. , Switzerland and West Germany have managed to wrestle down inflation rates . In most other countries , wages have continued rising so rapidly that even the moderate improvement in business that occurred sent prices up sharply too . Many European governments responded with austerity measures aimed at holding down demand . Business quickly slowed , while joblessness remained high-all without making much of a dent in the rate of price increases so far . <P> As a result , the Paris-based Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down growth forecasts for its 24 member nations , which make up most of the non-Communist industrialized world . Assuming no change in policy , and without allowing for the deadening impact of an oil-price rise , the OECD is predicting growth of 4.3% for the first six months of next year , v. its earlier forecast of 5.3% . For all of 1977 , the OECD sees the U.S. economy growing by only 4% , well below its earlier projection of 6% , while expansion in other industrial nations will be even slower . Moreover , the figures indicate that trade among the OECD members will rise only half as much next year as in 1976 , when it is expected to have increased by 10% . That would create explosive economic and political problems for nations , particularly Britain , that have been banking on an " export-led " recovery .
