 | The Facts About Microwave Ovens A compact black box perched on a counter in my kitchen is putting a bulky four-burner stove next to it out : - of business . Why ? Because the box , a microwave oven , has quartered the time needed to cook meals at my home . The oven 's phenomenal cooking speed is startling at first . Push a Thermador MC11 's ON switch : Exhaust fans whoosh , the magnetron tube buzzes with energy , and an interior light , interrupted by 140-rpm stirrer blades , flickers eerily . Microwaves @# literally shake food molecules 2,450 , - 000,000 times a second . Small food items emerge piping hot in seconds , a roast or chicken takes 15 minutes instead of one hour , a baked potato is out in four minutes . Several recent developments in the microwave-oven industry ? combined with gradually developing trends in America ? have stimulated a major boom in microwave-oven sales . Among them : ? Lower cost .

Better browning capabilities . Microwave ovens cook so fast that many items do n't really brown , but come out gray . New models solve this problem in several ingenious ways . ? Safety . Some potential customers were worried about reports that early models were a radiation hazard . Tough new government regulations have laid that problem to rest . ? New lifestyles . Microwave ovens have always been fast . But now that 's more important than ever . " Microwave cooking fits today 's lifestyles , " says Dan Gavalier , marketing vice-president for Litton Industries ' Atherton Division , " and goes with convenience foods , irregular meal preparation , the working 1 KM. wife and mother . " Whatever the reason , the boom is on . Robert Bruder , president of Litton 's oven division , pegged last year 's industry sales at 175,000 units .

Set it in the ir . wave oven when you get home : will be piping hot by the time you get your hands washed . Microwave ovens can perform t and other super-fast or off-beat c ing chores because they cook fundamentally different way from - other appliance in your kitchen . Your regular range , or convent i ( oven produces heat that is tr. mitted through the pot or air into food . In microwave cooking , on the er hand , very-high-frequency r : , . waves penetrate the food , agitate individual molecules , and cause it cook internally ( see box ) . The cooking source is not a flame or a r = tive-electric heating element , but magnetron ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in radar during WWII . Although it is an electronic appearance , do n't expect to find a maze tubes or transistors in a microwave oven . Home-use countertop oven have only one tube , the magnetron oscillator , and a high-voltage power supply for the tube . A metal waveguide feeds micro . wave energy from the magnetron into the metal-lined oven cavity . A mode stirrer , metal fan blades , is usually positioned between the cavity and way  | guide to help distribute the energy . stirrers reduce so-called hot and i spots in ovens by constantly sting peaks and nulls in the micro:x es around the cavity . Good oven ' sign minimizes hot and cold spots . The electromagnetic radiation used the microwave oven is radio ener . It 's called microwave radiation ause of the extremely short wavength ( or high frequency ) used . Acal wavelength at the 2450 freqency is about five inches ? that 's ve the UHF television freency and below infrared light in e electromagnetic spectrum ( see lustration ) . Microwaves are non-ionizing radiation ; unlike ionizing radiation such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call sufficient quantum energy to break chemical bonds . nd cause chemical changes at the molecular level . Nevertheless , federal legislation . hat went into effect Oct. 6 , 1971 , limits the amount of microwave energy leaking out of the oven to very low levels . Permissible standards now are one milliwatt per square centimeter at the factory and 5 mW/cm2 thereafter , measured two inches from the oven . Some manufacturers protested that the new standard was too strict , but all have refined their designs for the limits the amount of microwave energy leaking out of the oven to very low levels . Permissible standards now are one milliwatt per square centimeter at the factory and 5 mW/cm2 thereafter , measured two inches from the oven . Some manufacturers protested that the new standard was too strict , but all have refined their designs for the @# necessary certification label . ( Some ovens may be available yet that meet only the older standard , but will not have a certification on the label . ) Blocking leakage . Doors on microwave ovens are designed to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Door seals using metalContinued on page 161  | metal contact ( spring strips ) are common ; quarter-wave choke slots , sometimes filled with absorbing ma'ial , cancel microwave emissions . ngths of rubber tube covered with material braid are used , too . The viewing window , which lets , u monitor food cooking , is a tal screen perforated with holes . e holes are much smaller than icrowave wavelengths and block raiation . Additionally , the new regutions require two safety interlocks ovens to prevent accidental radiation when the door is opened . Some ens use three interlocks ; if one fails , e magnetron still shuts down . The basic principle of microwave eking ? electromagnetically forcing e molecules within the food to viate and create heat ? gives rise to any unique features . For example , per , china , and many plastics are ade of molecules that do not absorb icrowave energy . Thus they make xcellent cooking utensils . The food side them gets hot , but they do n't .

If they come cook in them . ( The deliberately included cules in its searing dis will get hot enough to and other foods ? later. ) @# In general , metals , which reflect energy back through the waveguide to the magnetron , were forbidden in older ovens . But new tube and oven designs now enable you to use shallow metal containers ? such as those for TV dinners . Such containers limit cooking to the top food surface . Polarized molecules . The rate at which various foods cook depends on several factors : the ability to absorb microwaves , how well heat is retained , original food temperature , size , and shape . Food molecules vary in the rate at which they flip back and forth in the changing electric field ? some are more " sluggish " than others . Forces restricting their vibration r-ay be mechanical , as with ice or solid fats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some molecules become polarized to @# a greater extent than others in the electric field . Since water molecules are polarized even outside an electric field , the presence of moisture in foods greatly influences its heating rate in a microwave oven . Moisture is not necessary for microwave heating , but most foods contain water in varying amounts . This does not mean , though , that foods with more moisture heat faster . A pound of food with 50-percent moisture heats faster than another pound of food with 75-percent moisture . All microwave cooking requires close attention to time , since oven temperature is not a factor . A food 's specific heat ? its ability to hold heat compared with water ? also plays an important role . Water has a value of 1.0 , but fats are about 0.5 . This means that water requires tw ; ce as much heat as fat to increase one degree in temperature . Try to warm a frosted pastry in an oven , and the frosting ? with a high fat and sugar content ? melts very quickly . Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually from the food surface inside . Microwaves , however , are able to penetrate foods about one inch , greatly accelerating cooking time . But waves penetrating both sides of a steak or hamburger quickly cook the meat to the same degree throughout . Since the cavity is cool , however , the meat surface is cooler ( through heat loss ) than its interior . The-resulting gray appearance of meats is not appealing to many . That 's where conventional ovens and recent microwave cooking developments come in . Owner 's manuals for microwave ovens suggest you quickly sear or broil some meats in conventional ovens ; complete the cooking in your microwave oven . New cookware . The new metalcontaining searing or burning cookware is an excellent solution to the problem . Because of their small size , however , large quantities of meats could be cooked better by other means . Litton 's Micro-Browners are preheated by microwaves : four minutes if you 're going to use them for meats , three minutes for pancakes , French toast , grilled sandwiches .

Most meats require less than two minutes ' cooking per side ; bread items take about 30 seconds a side . Browning ovens . Another solution to food browning is a resistance-heat-@#  | ing element that . emits infrared rays ? like broilers in electric stoves . Because of their wattage , these elements must be used after microwave cooking is completed . ( One exception is Thermador 's MTR 12 , which lets you use both functions simultaneously , but uses 240 volts . ) Sharp 's new R-6600 has two timers . After the microwave timer shuts off the magnetron , the browning timer begins its cycle . I 've found the searing cookware superior -- and faster ? than infrared for browning meats . Whole poultry , of course , ca n't be browned on searing cookware . But 5-10 minutes of infrared heat gives poultry a golden-brown appearance just like that of conventional cooking . As meat or poultry is browning , the interior finishes cooking . Ovens with browning elements do n't remain cool , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components . Heat buildup in a room is perceptible with the browning element on , but far less than with conventional ovens . Self browning . Larger roasts and poultry ? requiring 15 minutes or more ? brown themselves in microwave ovens . This browning is aided by surface fats that reach temperatures above 212 degrees F. There are problems with microwave cooking . For example , I observed , some toughening of roasts . Eggs , cheese , and bread have similar problems , and Cornell University 's Prof. Gertrude Armbruster explained why . The amount of heat energy applied to proteins in those foods is directly related to the formation of amino acid bonds . " The more bonds you form . the tougher the structure , " she says . Manually cycling ovens on and off to prevent excessive heat buildup has achieved excellent results at Cornell . Programed cooking . Armbruster believes programed on/off switches ? like Litton 's 402 for thawing ? " could make a lot of things possible . " The 402 's 30-second on/off duration ( a fixed program ) does not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microwave cooking is determining the correct timing for various quantities of food . Two items do n't take twice as long as a single item , and timing can be critical . Many cookbooks provided with ovens are badly inadequate in this area . One that is n't , Litton 's 168-page manual prepared with Pilsbury , is jammed with tables and microwave-based recipes .
