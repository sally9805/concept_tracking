VERONICA 'S ROOM <P> by IRA LEVIN <P> In one sort of suspense thriller , the audience is let in on a secret that the characters do not know . In another , the characters possess some piece of knowledge that the audience is in the dark about . Inadvertently , Ira Levin has written a mystery in which his characters seem to know something that has eluded him . Veronica 's Room poses a puzzle in the first act and tries to resolve it with three or four new puzzles in the second act . Result : frustration . <P> Despite its ultimate failure , the play is not badly written , and an air of expectancy , abetted by expert performances , hovers over it . A girl ( Regina Barf ) and a boy ( Kipp Osborne ) out on their first date are lured to a musty mansion in a Boston suburb by a middle-aged man and wife ( Eileen Heckart and Arthur Kennedy ) who act as caretakers of the estate . There the girl is slyly coaxed into impersonating an invalid named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to the girl is , understandably , the reviewer 's secret . One flaw that may safely be mentioned is that while the caretakers try in every way to convince the girl that the time is 1935 and not 1973 , they never succeed . If the girl plausibly believed that she was losing her mind , the play might have achieved some of the tingling suspense of Gaslight . <P> Playwright Levin develops the weirdness of his characters at the expense of their motivations . Thus incest , necrophilia and schizophrenic identity shifts enter the picture without clarifying it . This is a jigsaw puzzle with too many pieces . <P> T. E. Kalem
