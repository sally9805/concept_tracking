Ben Franklin invented bifocals . Supposedly so he could watch the lips of French diplomats ( he did n't speak French very well ) without taking his eyes off the documents they proposed in the business of the colonies . Utter nonsense , of course . He invented bifocals to watch girls . When in France do as the Frenchmen do , and they do n't watch diplomats ' lips , that is unless Bardot has been given a portfolio recently . In his own words : " I had formerly two pairs of spectacles , which I shifted occasionally , as in traveling I sometimes read , and often wanted to regard the Prospects . " When a man with Franklin 's reputation capitalizes " prospects , " he 's not talking about scenic rocks and rills . He wanted to keep the lower half of his peepers focused on a comely bosom close at hand without losing the vision of a well-turned ankle across a crowded room some enchanted evening two hundred years ago . John Adams wryly observed , " Franklin at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste for it . " Franklin , always thinking aphoristically , figured the pain and discomfort of old age were directly associated with the lack of converse with pretty girls . When he was suffering from gout , he wrote his current French flame , " When I was a young man and enjoyed more favors from the sex than at present , I never had the gout . If the ladies at Passy he was living there in 1783 had more of that Christian charity which I have so often recommended to you , in vain , I would not have the gout now . " And nobody ever observed more , or more deeply , than Franklin when ogling the fair sex . " When women cease to be handsome , they study to be good . To maintain their influence over men , they supply the diminution of beauty by augmentation of utility . They learn to do a thousand services small and great , and are the most tender and useful of all friends when you are sick . Does that include love-sick ? Thus they continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be found as an old woman who is not a good woman . " Not exactly a male chauvinist pig . The most significant aspect of the bifocal lens as it pertains to girl watching is of course the time it saves . Girl watching is girl studying , or , the proper study of mankind is woman . Women have to know they are being watched for it to be any fun . A full-length feature movie has to pass in a glance . For example : You are standing at the shopping center when a girl in a microbe skirt whizzes by . Your eyes : " Gulp ! " Her eyes : " I 'm on my way to the drugstore for Pampers and pabulum for the twins and a drum and bugle set for their younger brother and sister , the plumbing 's overflowing , the lawn is neck-high and something awful 's banging around in the car engine . Follow me if you want to . You can meet my husband who 's a star in kung fu movies . " Your eyes : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ span of a wink . ( A figurative expression ; avoid winking . It means something else . ) You have a lot to say too . Your eyes : " While there may be a recession floating around in some parts of the country the doors of my Mercedes are locked . From the inside . It 'll make 98.6 mph in 4.3 seconds from standing still . " Her eyes : " If I could just conquer this motion sickness .. . . " The fact that you do n't have to pause to whip out your long-range cheaters to snag these beauties saves precious time , and Franklin 's other inventions  --  the key on the end of a kite string , the let the lightning down to the ground through a rod , the wet your fingers and rub a series of rolling . glasses , the haul the dirt and ashes of the fireplace out in the middle of the living room floor , the insurance company and his too numerous to mention Mary Worthisms  --  pale by comparison . With Franklin 's death the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a padlock disguised as a cameo , moved toward her nose , and her hemline headed for Satan 's kingdom . Men were reduced to staring at their egg timers to pass the hours safely away . We know this from daguerreotypes  --  photographic images reproduced on tin or copper plates . Women tried to conform to this hard image by putting as much metal on their person as the traffic ( which was n't much ) would allow . Iron bustles , steel stays , mourning bracelets and parures , a lot of jewlery with locks of dead people 's hair arranged in attractive flowers probably did as much to bring about the Civil War as slavery . Rifle-bore blue was the favorite color with gun-metal gray a heavy second . We are the children of the British . And sometimes it pays to listen to Mama , because a few years before our conflagration of brotherly love , Florence Nightingale , figuring that if men are going to watch them , the girls better make themselves available , set out for the Crimea with a package of Band-aids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bosporus and proving the worth of women in medicine were secondary considerations . Chicken broth caught on in America and it was n't long before Scarlett O'Hara and her ilk were comforting the wounded ( especially the younger ones ) from Manassas to Memphis . And since you ca n't bend over to fluff a pillow if you 're dressed in a suit of armor , the portcullis rose to reveal the rose itself . About this time also , the invention of the wheel began to show its true value . Women started to cycle . Skirts got Continued on page 100 The lady plays golf and tennis well , and travels widely , but it seems in all ways that she is very much a favorite of the Muse . Undoubtedly she shall have music wherever she goes , if only in her heart and mind where such melodies flow , some written and others not yet brought to manuscript . We salute Mrs. Stewart for her musical contribution to our national patriotic literature . And we bow as well in admiration to Mr. Hoeppler and Mr. Gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . We thank all , in fact , who contributed , and trust that the joy of creative accomplishment , no less theirs than the winner 's , has brought rewards of its own . Certainly , had they been able to hear the young voices of the Butler chorus sing their works , they would have known that every note set down in this competition has had a ringing response . continued from page 16 dominant master to whom one is a mute and acquiescent appendage . The changes in attitude have been helped along not only by enlightened , mature women but by intelligent younger men  --  heterosexual , successful and attractive  --  who frankly admit they enjoy the company of adult females . Pressed , they will admit that an older woman is good for the ego , that her lack of competitiveness , her disinterest in " equality , " her genuine liking for and admiration of men are refreshing . Too many young women come on too strong today , they 'll tell you . It 's like being out with a bunch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trying to ape the tough jargon of the young , the grown-up lady has everything at hand to help her stay attractive and desirable through most of her life . She has learned about diet and exercise and rest , discovered the miracles of hairstyling and makeup , found she has a mind that can be skillfully and engagingly used . She keeps her body , her head and her brains in good condition . And she has a new sense of confidence , a lack of humiliation about having passed any age . The only time the mature woman is " over the hill " is when she 's heading for the next tee on the golf course . Armed with all this new and delicious knowledge , seeing the exampies of other women her age , enjoying the genuine admiration of younger men , watching the unwitting self-destruction of militant young women , aware of the social acceptance of men her age , the mature woman was one day bound to ask herself and the world , " What about me ? Why should I settle for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' still young ' husband has left for greener pastures ? Or why should I , a middle-aged widow , be compelled to seek only partners of ' suitable ' age , when eligible ' men in my age bracket are the rarest species of all ? If you do n't laugh at a gentleman of sixty with a chick of thirty , why do you snicker at a woman of fifty with a man of thirty-five ? Why do you accept any unattached male at your dinner table and cringe from the thought of the lone woman ? Why must I be put on the shelf because you know how old I am ? Why has the gander got all the golden eggs when I 'm the goose who laid ' em ? " Why indeed ? Whoever made up those rules about " women 's place " in the home , in the community or in the sphere of romance is no longer around to enforce them . Older women no longer can be confined or categorized . They can live as they like and love whom they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . With pleasure .
