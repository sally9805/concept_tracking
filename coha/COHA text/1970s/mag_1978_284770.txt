THE WRONG HORSE <P> by Laurence Stern <P> Times Books ; 170 pages ; $10 <P> Henry Kissinger 's triumphs have had one father . His one unmitigated debacle is an orphan . It was the Cyprus crisis of 1974 , a chain of coup , invasion , countercoup and embargo that left the southern flank of NATO in chaos and U.S. prestige in the Eastern Mediterranean at an ebb . Laurence Stern , a veteran reporter on national security for the Washington Post , has written a compact and compelling account of the affair . He traces U.S. policy from the Truman Doctrine of 1947 to Clark Clifford 's inconclusive mediation mission earlier this year , but he concentrates on the American missteps in the summer and fall of 1974 . <P> In July of that year the junta then in power in Athens conspired with extremist Greek Cypriots to topple Archbishop Makarios , President of Cyprus . Their goal was to unite the island republic with Greece . Makarios barely escaped with his life and fled into exile . His place was usurped by Nikos Sampson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkish minority on Cyprus . After a week of protests and warnings , Ankara moved unilaterally to avert Greek annexation of the island ; Turkish paratroops and landing craft invaded . Sampson fell . So , within days , did his mentors in Athens . Makarios returned to Cyprus , and democracy was restored in Greece . <P> But there was no happy ending . The Turkish invasion force dug in , occupying the northern third of the island . Congress , over the objections of the Ford Administration , responded by cutting off American military supplies to Turkey . So it has continued for three years : Cyprus remains politically divided and economically shattered ; Greece and Turkey , Politically divided , economically shattered . ostensible partners in the Atlantic Alliance , are enemies united only by their distaste for the U.S. <P> With good reason , claims Stern . Kissinger ignored U.S. intelligence predictions of the plot against Makarios , thus missing a chance to head off the crisis . Worse , he allowed the Greek junta to think it had tacit U.S. approval for its plot . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the world was condemning Sampson and his backers in Athens , the Secretary of State did not disguise his relief at the defeat of Makarios , whom he had long regarded as a mercurial , left-leaning troublemaker . By his refusal to denounce the coup , Kissinger seemed to tilt toward Sampson and the military rulers . Then , when democracy replaced dictatorship in Greece , and Turkey switched from being an aggrieved neighbor to an often brutal occupier of Cyprus , Kissinger shifted his stance in favor of Ankara . Throughout the episode , in the metaphor of Author Stern 's title , the U.S. backed " the wrong horse . " <P> The events in the Eastern Mediterranean in 1974 add up to an episode that the former Secretary would rather not remember . Stern 's lucid and convincing treatment guarantees that the world will not forget it . - Strobe Talbott
