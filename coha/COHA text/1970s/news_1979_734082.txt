txt The Middle East verdict on the Carter administration seems all but unanimous . In the words of one Beirut editorial , Washington appears fast on its way to becoming a " super nonpower " in a region that President Carter has made his top foreign policy priority . Since American influence depends on American credibility and prestige , and since power depends on perceived power , the implications for the United States of current perceptions are at best disturbing . They also tend to build pressure on President Carter to make tangible progress in his high-profile search for Middle East peace . Moderate Arab diplomats now speak of a possible superpower vacuum in the area and voice concern that the Soviet Union might eagerly fill the gap . The problem boils down to " image , " a prominent Beirut editor says . From the Middle East to Mexico some 10,000 miles away , foreign countries have been snubbing or sniping at President Carter . // From page 1 US standing sags in Mideast circles " Rightly or wrongly , American policy has taken on an outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editor asserts . " It 's a self-reinforcing process . With Washington on the defensive , more and more states seem ready to pile on . " President Carter 's Middle East foes , of course , have stepped up propaganda attacks . But even allies ? Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Israel , and embattled North Yemen ? are seen here as keeping their options open . Saudi Arabia , Washington 's billionaire oil ally , backed out of planned mid-March talks with President Carter , and then denied Washington 's explanation that Saudi Crown Prince Fand was ill . Then , in an interview published here March 3 , Saudi Foreign Minister Saudi ibn Faisal praised past Soviet support for the Arabs and hinted that trade relations could be established between his rigidly Islamic state and Moscow . The Saudi statement appears here to be less a " come hither " for Moscow than a " stay thither " for Washington , in view of a strengthened Left in the Middle East after the revolution in Iran . Caution in Egypt , too Egypt , too , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-controlled press have suggested that President Carter 's current push for an Egyptian-Israeli treaty might be something of a last chance . And an Arab League conference March 4 on the border war in Yemen gave the Egyptians their highest-level contact with hard-line Arabs since President Sadat 's controversial trip to Jerusalem nearly 16 months ago . The Cairo weekly Akhbar al-Yom , in an editorial that , it is thought here , could not have been published without official clearance , said most Egyptians were bored by the peace ef forts with Israel and , if canvassed , " would ask for suspension of the talks . " Israel , despite billions of dollars in US arms , rejected President Carter 's call for a second Camp David summit in late February and openly dismissed his insistence that a peace treaty , was close . Finally , North Yemen ? a precarious and conservative tribal state battling Marxist South Yemen ? also has joined the knock-Carter bandwagon . When the US State Department assured North Yemen of a speedup in arms deliveries , its foreign minister promptly criticized the announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gloating from the PLO A Palestine Liberation Organization official could not help gloating : " For the past few years , the Americans have seemed a crucial Middle East element , even to their adversaries . They looked like winners , even when they made mistakes . Now that appears to be changing . " A growing number of Arab and Western diplomats here believe that President Carter has appeared to react to events , rather than control them : ? In Iran , Washington first seemed unready ( or unwilling ) to admit that Shah Muhammad Reza Pahlavi was finished , Arab diplomats say . But finished he was . Interim Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar , briefly backed by Washington , also is now gone . ? On the Camp David front , the American administration , set back by Iran has had difficulty bringing either Egypt or Israel into a ? peace settlement ? let alone moderate Arabs like Jordan and Saudi Arabia . ? Finally , in a development that was front-page news in the Middle East , Mexico snubbed President Carter during the US leaders 's visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , is in trouble . Its diplomacy , the newspaper argues , has taken on the appearance of " a hesitation waltz . . . or a boat adrift on the seas of major world events . "
