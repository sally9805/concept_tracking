The Time to Rise <P> Sir / Bull's-eye ! The crisis in Congress is indeed the issue for the decade Jan. 15 . America 's survival as a democracy will . I believe , largely depend on the strength of the pressure applied by the media , and direct citizen action toward correcting congressional impotence . The federal legislature has too long been on its knees to the Chief Executive . <P> It is high time for some real eyeball to eyeball contact . <P> <P> RICHARD A. W ATKINS <P> New York City <P> Sir / Although I enjoyed your story on Congress . I found Correspondent Neil Mac Neil 's contention that what Congress needs is " some of the arrogance of past taskmasters who ran Congress with heavy hands . " a little hard to swallow . <P> In my reading of presidential history , it seems past Chief Executives such as Lincoln , both Roosevelts and Truman used strong Executive action to save the Union , restore our economy and defeat tyranny abroad . <P> Each of these Presidents had to take action where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . <P> <P> WESLEY GENE BEVERLIN <P> Los Angeles <P> Sir / Unfortunately we have elected ourselves four more years of war , favoritism to the few , administrative stranglehold on our Judicial Branch and dictatorial leadership . If Congress is to balance the lopsided Government , it will be done only when some future President exercises insight and humility enough to give Congress back its power . <P> I fail to believe that Congress has the discipline or courage to carry out the task on its own behalf . <P> LEONARD ; . RIZZO <P> Green Bay , Wis . <P> Sir / Impounding appropriated funds is a well-established and legitimate power of the President , not a tactic invented by Richard Nixon to perpetuate pollution . <P> It is necessary to have a Chief Executive who determines with his management and budget people a cohesive and coherent pattern of spending , given the enormously increased complexity of the budgetary process today . <P> To return to the era of " Uncle Joe " Cannon , the apex of House rule , is a reckless and ridiculous idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Sir / In " A Cast of Characters for the 93rd Congress " you mentioned that Senator Sam Ervin is " . . . a Democratic battler for individual rights with a blind spot for blacks . " As one who lobbied for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment , let me add from experience that the Senator has another blind spot when it comes to individual rights - women . <P> <P> DEBORAH WALTER <P> Washington , D.C. <P> <P> Sir / Here is a footnote to illustrate how in the 19th century the power of the Speaker of the House of Representatives extended into the President 's bedroom . During the Administration of President Benjamin Harrison , the Speaker of the House . " Czar " Tom Reed , refused congressional authority for Mrs. Harrison 's plan to expand the living quarters in the White House because the <P> President had refused to appoint Czar Reed 's candidate for collector of customs in Portland , Maine . <P> <P> ELLEN ROBINSON EPSTEIN DAVID EPSTEIN <P> Washington . D.C. <P> <P> Shake-Up in the FBI <P> Sir / " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI Director L. Patrick Gray .
