French President Georges Pompidou recently confided to a friend that " when people shake my hand these days , I get the impression they are really taking my pulse . " With some reason . <P> Public worry over the President 's health has mounted from the whispered rumor stage to front-page news . During the past year , Pompidou , now 61 , has gained at least 20 Ibs. , ballooning from bourgeois rotundity to sickly flabbiness . His complexion has become blotchy , and he has begun to walk stiffly and clumsily . Descending from his jet to meet with President Nixon in Iceland late last month , he stumbled and nearly fell , though he was clinging firmly to both handrails . <P> Those distressing symptoms were more than enough to touch off public concern . Speculation about Pompidou 's well-being reached new heights when the Elyse Palace announced last week that the President was canceling several social engagements over the next several weeks , " because he had not had the opportunity to take the rest needed to recover from the influenza he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt at public reassurance , an official emphasized that Pompidou would carry on his regular office routine , which this week included meeting three African heads of state , the prime ministers of Korea and Mauritius , and several high-ranking French officials . Pompidou , the Elysee Palace said , would go ahead with official visits to West Germany later this month and to China in September , and would receive Italian President Giovanni Leone in Paris in late June . <P> Behind the official explanations , however , grimmer rumors were circulating . Elyse officials blamed his puffiness on the cortisone he is said to be taking to control rheumatism . But there was considerable speculation that his flabbiness and frailty were really due to radioactive cobalt treatments for a disease thought to be cancer of the bone marrow . Lending some credence to this rumor is the fact that one of his physicians , Professor Jean Bernard , is a leading leukemia specialist . <P> Pompidou 's seven-year term of office expires in 1976 . Under the constitution he can resign or be removed from office if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , national elections would be held within 35 days . Among the possible successors : Minister of Finance Valry Giscard d'Estaing , 47 , and former Premier Jacques Chaban-Delmas , 58 . If Pompidou decided to step down , he would almost certainly attempt to hand-pick a successor . <P> For the moment , at least , that eventuality seemed distant . After a midweek Cabinet meeting , Government Spokesman Joseph Comiti , who also happens to be a surgeon , said that the President was in " very great form . " But then he added that Pompidou was leaving Paris immediately for a week 's holiday at his country home in Cajarc , near Toulouse . Was he ill ? " Well , " said Comiti , " he would not be resting at Cajarc if nothing were wrong with him . Everybody is ill from time to time . " Trailing Pompidou 's limousine on the road to Cajarc was an ambulance .
