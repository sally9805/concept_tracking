THE PEOPLE 'S WAR , BRITAIN 1939-1945 by Angus Calder . 656 pages . Pantheon. $8.95 . <P> In the Century of the Common Man , the grandeurs and miseries of war were extended to more and more of the hitherto underprivileged . The guns of August ( 1914 ) ushered in universal conscription to sustain the mass armies . The warplanes of 1939 ensured a mass distribution of war to civilians-sadly changed from keeping the home fires burning to putting them out . Such thoughts are provoked by Angus Calder 's The People 's War . <P> The title is just . For the British , this was not so much a war of pitched battles between armies as it was of ersatz eggs , smashed plumbing , maimed children and " austerity " - general misery that is orchestrated by enemy bombs and British bureaucrats . The 67 pictures that serve as illustrations to the book will be emotive to the older generation in Britain and should be informative to the young everywhere . Calder himself is young . He was born in 1942 , not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Churchill . The calculative eye of history , however , might identify it as Britain 's most miserable hour since the Black Death some 600 years earlier . <P> Sense of Community . Calder ably combines the methods of the journalist , historian , sociologist , researcher , pollster and commentator to tell how it was to be a British civilian in Hitler 's war . The cumulative effect is occasionally overwhelming . The innocent bystander ( if 25 years ' distance makes the reader innocent ) picks his way through the human rubble of five ruinous years of war and still wonders how the British managed to " take it . " The impression is clear , though , that only a people long nourished by a willingness to " put up with things " and a strong sense of community could have done so . <P> Along with everything else that he does , Calder is a part-time poet . But recreated memories of his nation under the bombs do not inspire him to poetry . Indeed , there was precious little " war poetry " from World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graves explain why : the soldier " can not feel that his rendezvous with death is more certain than that of his Aunt Fanny , the fire-watcher . " <P> The absence of poetics-and heroics - seems appropriate , but the reader is warned that Calder 's historic rehash is served up with the left hand . Tories are the villains-for Munich , for building the wrong sort of planes , for sheer Blimpishness . The fact that the Labor Party kept on thinking that it could have peace and disarmament is barely mentioned . Such partisanship ill becomes a study that ends with the Empire overseas liquidated to the tune of 4,000 million pounds sterling , 500,000 dwellings smashed , 355,000 dead ( 62,000 of them civilians ) , more rationing looming up , and " with spirit and flesh rebelling against further effort . " A more fitting and more sensible attitude was struck by the old Tory Churchill when , after the people 's war , the people voted him out of office . " Ingratitude , " suggested his physician , Lord Moran . " Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call it that . They have had a very hard time . "
