<P> East and West may talk of dtente , but along the Berlin Wall the dominant sound is still the staccato of the machine gun . Almost every night the " Grepos , " East Germany 's infamous border police , turn on their searchlights and open up at a fugitive real or imagined , who they think is trying to cross into the West . <P> When the Grepos began firing long , sustained bursts last week , several hundred residents of the French sector rushed to their windows and balconies to watch the tragic drama below . On the death strip , which at night is always illuminated with high-intensity floodlights , three people were running for their lives . One was cut down , and the other two were captured before they could get to the Wall . All three were hauled roughly away . <P> Angered by the brutal scene , several residents ran onto the soccer field separating the buildings from the Wall . Some started tearing out concrete slabs with their bare hands . Others joined them , and soon some 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming their frustration and anger at the hated Grepos . A hole six feet wide was ripped out of the barrier , and several young men prepared to assault the other side . Their impotence was quickly made clear , however , by an East German soldier , who pointedly reloaded his submachine gun and aimed it at their faces . Scattered shouts of " murderers , " " criminals " and " swine " changed to a rhythmic chant of rage and frustration . Eventually West Berlin police arrived and told the crowd to go back to bed . " Ah , they were great , these Berliners , just great , " exclaimed a French military policeman who was there . <P> The French commandant , speaking for his British and American colleagues as well , protested the incident , particularly he said , " when so many people in Europe hope for a lessening of tension . " Added the Berliner Morgenpost : " The spirit of Helsinki may wave where it wants , but it is not waving in and around Berlin . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
