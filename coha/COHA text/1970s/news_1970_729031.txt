" With those Words , delivered in a trembling Voice , President Pompidou announced on radio and television this morning that Charles de Gaulle died last night at his country retreat in Colombey-les-DeuxEglises . He would have been 80 years old Nov. 22 . Death came to the wartime leader and peacetime Premier and President while he was playing a game of solitaire on a little card table in the quiet of his living room . Stricken with a heart attack , he collapsed at 7:30 P.M. and is believed to have died of a ruptured aorta soon afterward . No State Funeral President Pompidou , who succeeded the general as chief of state on June 20 , 1969 , was immediately informed , as were other high officials , but public announcement was held up until 9:41 o'clock this morning . The Cabinet met hurriedly in a somber atmosphere , and the President made his broadcast at 1 P.M. No explanation was given for the delay overnight in the announcement of the death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Undisturbed in the hours immediately afterward . According to the general 's wishes , no state funeral will be held . General de Gaulle is to be buried Thursday morning in the churchyard of Colombeyles-Deux-Eglises in an " extremely simple " ceremony . A memorial service will be held at the same hour ? 11 A.M. ? in Notre Dame Cathedral , and it is there that President Pompidou and other French leaders are to join with some SO chiefs of foreign states or heads of government ? among them President .

Nation in Mourning Other leaders expected to attend include Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany , Emperor . Haile Selassie of Ethiopia , Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and President Giuseppe Saragat of Italy . National mourning until the end of the month has been proclaimed , and all flags have been placed at half-staff . As the mourning began , the French National Assembly adjourned its session . The regular Thursday meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genera conference of the United Na tions Educational , Scientifi and Cultural Organization me and recessed . The funeral arrangements were made in accord with what Mr. Pompidou read when he opened an envelope , on which was written " For My Funeral , " that was handed to him on Jan. 16 , 1952 . Ruling out a national funeral , the general had said that only the French armed forces could participate officially , but in modest numbers . There was to be no eulogy in Colombey or elsewhere , and no places were to be reserved except for the family , members of the Colombey Municipal Council and companions of the Order of Liberation  --  tthose who were the first to join de Gaulle in 1940 , when he called on France to continue the war against Nazi Germany . But the general added : " The men and women of France and of other countries of the world may , if they wish , do my memory the honor of accompanying my body to its last resting place , but it is in silence that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buses were to take the thousands of people expected Thursday in Colombey , and the National Federation of Road . Transport asked trucks to stay , off the- roads leading to the Haute-Marne Department , where the village of a few hundred people is situated , about 120 miles east of Paris . The body lay in the living room of the Colombey house dressed in a brigadier general 's uniform with the French tricolor draped across it . At the feet was the Cross of Lorraine , symbol of the wartime Fighting French , and in the general 's hands was a rosary given him by Pope Paul VI . Debit Is First Visitor Around him were his wife , their daughter Elizabeth , and her husband , Gen. Alain de Boissieu , and the de . Gaulles ' son , Philippe , a navy captain , and his wife . There are seven grandchildren : The first Government member to arrive was Defense Minister Michel Debra , the general 's first Premier and one of his most ardent supporters . Unable to go to the funeral because . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier Jacques Chaban-Delmas are expected to visit tomorrow . It became known today that de Gaulle lapsed into unconsciousness on his collapse . His wife , who was with him , called a physician and a Roman Catholic priest , Canon Claude Jaugey , and they arrived as he was at the point of death . Mr. Pompidou , in his television appearance , looked and talked like a man profoundly affected by the death of the man who had brought him into public life and paved his way to supreme power . After saying " France is a widow , " Mr. Pompidou declared : " In 1940 de Gaulle saved honor . In 1944 he led us to liberation and to victory . In 1958 he spared us civil war . He gave today 's France her institutions , her independence and her place in the world . " In this hour of mourning for the fatherland , let us bow before the sorrow of Mrs. de Gaulle , her children and her grandchildren . Let us measure the duties that gratitude imposes upon us . Let us promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the national soul let de Gaulle live eternally . " Theaters to be Closed As part of the national mourning , radio and television stations abandoned their regular programs in favor of those with a solemn cast . Ordinary Frenchmen went about their business as usual , however . The country is to begin dropping its normal routine tomorrow with the Armistice Day holiday . On Thursday all movie and legitimate theaters are to be closed , as are schools and government offices . In the National Assembly , many legislators heard the news only after their arrival for a budget debate , which was canceled . Marc Jaquet , head of the Gaullist group , called out to his associates " Children , Father is dead ! " After de Gaulle 's departure from power last year , the Gaullist deputies were often called " de Gaulle 's or phans . " The Communist party , in aI double-edged statement , recalled the general 's wartime role and said , " His death could leave no Frenchman indifferent . " It added that he returned to power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in accordance with " the aspirations of big capital . " While most comments of public figures were eulogies , a similar distinction between the liberator of 1944 and the statesman of 1958-69 was drawn by the Socialist Daniel Mayer . Guy Mollet , the former Premier who fought de Gaulle during the last decade , said that it was the wrong moment to discuss his place in history . , On the Avenue de Breteuil , behind Les Invalides , hundreds emorial at Notre Dame 8 of Parisians waited patiently in a light drizzle to sign a rememI brance book in the hallway of de Gaulle 's modest apartmentoffice. c The man they mourned , a t leader who in war and peace refused to ? accept defeat or sec ; and-class status for France , had been out of power and virtually out of sight since April 28 , 1969 . On the previous day , a Sunday , the French had rejected in a referendum one of the last of the great reforms he had eontemplated ; a decentralization of power by forming regions and making over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement . He had said he would resign if the proposals were rejected and toward midnight , as the result became certain , he announced that he would cease to exercize his functions as of noon the next day . First Memoir Appeared So far as the public was concerned , he was never heard from again until last month , when the first of what was to be a three-volume set of memoirs appeared . He made no public appearances , except as a tourist , and no public statements . Offices were set up for him in Paris but he refused to occupy them . When the election to choose his successor wils held , he went to Ireland . He dwelt on the past , and those who watched him work on the ? memoirs reported that he did-so with the intensity of a. man who was afraid death might catchlim before he could finish . Only two chapters of the volume are complete , it is said . The first has seven chapters .. The second volume had been awaited with at least as much curiosity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pompidou played a role of the first rank as Premier for six years . The general barely mentioned his successor in the first volume . Last Day Was a Usual One COLOMBEY - LES - DEUX - EGLISES , France , Nov. 111(AP) ? De Gaulle 's last day , according to members of his family , was a normal one  --  going through his mail and writing , in the strong penmanship that rarely needed erasure or correction . He began work at 9:30 A.M. , two chapters into the text of the work on his final presidential years . He ate lunch with his wife and they walked in the woods , part of . their routine . He worked on his manuscript again in  --  the afternoon . Around 7 P.M. he began a game of solitaire. while waiting for the evening news . Canon Jaugey related later that Mrs. de Gaulle said- her , husband put both hands below , his waist and cried out : " Oh , how it hurts ! " When the priest arrived de Gaulle . was unconscious and " was suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day before . " He seemed normal , " the priest said . " There were no signs of fatigue or apparent illness . Everyone was surprised . "
