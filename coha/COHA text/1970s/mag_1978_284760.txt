Small N.Y . college wrestles with a not so puckish problem <P> Quiet , scholarly Union College in Schenectady , N.Y. , does not give athletic scholarships . And its hockey team had disappeared early in World War II , along with Lucky Strike Green and natural rubber tires . But in 1974 a 90-year-old professor emeritus of religion named H. Lawrence Achilles gave Union $1.5 million to build a rink . Swiftly the college acquired a famous hockey coach , a winning team and a sure source of income from gate receipts and public rental . But as of last week , Union also had a rebellious faculty and a troubled president charged with selling out to the jocks . Its coach has quit despite running up a 46-7-2 record over 2% seasons , and so has his entire team . <P> The coach , and cause clebre of the Union uproar , is Ned Harkness , a tense , passionate competitor who eats poached eggs to soothe a nervous stomach and refers to hockey pucks as " black vitamins . " A leg wound as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing , but at 56 , he is legendary in hockey for building championship teams practically from scratch . He was doing just that for Union when he quit , and he did it twice before-first at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and then for Cornell . After his Cornell team won all 29 of its games , including the national college championships in 1970 , Harkness moved on to coach the Detroit Red Wings . The pros , however , took a jaundiced view of his gung-ho pep talks . Said one player : " The man 's mad . " Said New England Whalers Center Gordie Howe : " If Ned has a fault , it 's that he thinks hockey too much . " <P> The man 's genius , and his downfall , was recruiting . Harkness could scour the plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan signing up farm boys better than anyone . When asked why he switched from R.P.I. to Cornell , he used to say : " Because it 's 90 miles closer to the Canadian border . " <P> In 1974 , after Union President Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anemic athletic program , Harkness had little trouble lining up talent , not only from Canada but from Massachusetts and Michigan . But to do it , he broke strict New England Small College Athletic Conference rules forbidding a coach to visit a prospect at his home . Cited by the conference last spring , he at first denied the misdeed to Bonner . " I lied , " Harkness admits , adding , as if to explain everything , " but I lied to save my hockey program . " He was suspended by Bonner but reinstated by the college trustees . <P> The outraged faculty voted no confidence in Bonner . He offered his resignation . The trustees refused it . Not to be outdone , the faculty-run admissions committee last spring turned down four of Harkness 's new hockey recruits as academically inadequate . ( They went to Harvard , Yale , Dartmouth and Cornell. )
