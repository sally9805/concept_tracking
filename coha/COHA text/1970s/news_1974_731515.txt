Of Ecology , ' the Law and Selfishness To the Editor : I have long ' been involved in the " Environmental Law " that Professor Roberts speaks of letter Sept. 10 and have been received kindly as a kind of law reformer by university and law school students , including those in Professor Roberts ' classes . Alas ! I may now be one of the " New Hypocrites . " Professor Roberts ; in 1970 , excited the whole environmental , movement by urging that environmental , rights be recognized as having constitutional status . He now resorts to very readable but I submit unfair hyperbole to make a self-evident point , that some plaintiffs in environmental lawsuits are selfish . Come now , ? Professor ! ; Roberts , is there any rule of law , in any nonenvironmental field , : which says that only the noble  --  meaning people like you and me  --  mky sue ? Would you volunteer to ' draft-a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have the particularity necessary for enforcement by ' , the courts ? He juxtaposes the " status of trees " with " the rights of all our people to obtain for themselves a decent habitat . " How , wrong he is would be readily apparent if he would spend some time in places like Newburgh , N. Y. , where little people have fought off a wholly unnecessary jetport , or in Los Angeles , where significant victories have been achieved by environmental lawyers for Chicanos fighting expressways. s ? . Please also consider how Robert Moses , currently being reappraised for what he did to the poor , and the The Nixon Affair ' To the Editor : The inequity and abuse of the pardon power shown by President Ford 's recent act is too obvious to require more comment . There is another aspect of the Nixon affair , however , that deserves scrutiny : this is the financial emolument that is asked of the taxpayer to pay off Mr. Nixon 's expenses and provide him  --  a lifetime pension . It was never intended that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , but for his resignation , would have been impeached and , but for his pardon , would probably have been convicted of crime . Under the circumstances , it seems only fair that the entity that was most responsible for Mr. Nixon 's nomination and election pay the cost of supporting him , if the cost is to be paid at all . Why should the ordinary taxpayer be required to put up the money ? In summary , why not find a way to pay Mr. Nixon out " of ' funds from the Committee to Re-Elect the President ? The easiest way to do this would be for the Republican party , which has been most hurt but which also has some responsibility for Mr. Nixon 's election , to donate the money to the Treasury for the specific purpose . The act would be good public relations for the party and might , even ' help its recovery in future elections . EDWARD W. HEROLD Princeton , N. J. , Sept. 9 , 1974 To the Editor : As ambivalent as I was on the pros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was at least refreshing that President Ford took definitive action on the matter in his Sept. 8 pardon of the former President . We live , unfortunately , in a time when decision-making is played down and more emphasis is put on " coma mittee-think . " ' In both his action on the Nixon pardon and his reflections on leniency on the amnesty issue before a V.F.W. convention , Mr. Ford demonstrated a clear-cut capacity for leadership . I for one-applaud this characteristic of decisiveness and wish that it would Why Rents Must Rise To the Editor : The present rate of abandonment of apartments in New York City-3,000 a month as reported by Roger Starr , the Housing and Development Administrator  --  will be doubled by this time next year , unless the city supports needed rent increases and fuel and labor pass-alongs and delivers on its promise to speed up the issuance of forms in the Maximum Base Rent Program . Calling for more subsidized housing , as.Mr . Starr has done , is to avoid the issue . Owners can not afford to maintain buildings when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ridiculously low levels . powerless of New York , would have fared if in the thirties and forties citizens had had the standing which they now have ' in the Federal courts . The argument that trees should have legal status is respectable . It  --  is simply the legal application of Aldo , Leopold 's land ethic . Environmental law does not " suffer from hypocrisy . " As with all other bodies of public law , diverse groups with diverse interests use it . Vermont wants to - limit the exploitation of its hills . Ramapo does not want to become Levittown . The citizens of both are neither evil nor hypocritical for enacting laws to help themselves . Most environmentalists , including myself , feel ' as passionately as Professor Roberts the injustices of the poverty and bigotry that our system still tolerates . I feel confident that we will in a reasonable . time right those injustices . Should those who then begin to share equitably in our affluence find that concrete is everywhere , will we have served them ? Let us attack injustice directly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using the land as the frontier to which we refer our troubles and our troubled . Professor Roberts says that our society " does not possess an ethical dimension . " If by any law he can draft we can give it that dimension , I will write to my Congressman urging its passage . Until then I will keep trying to make good environmental law in courts open to the selfish as well as to him and to me . DAVID SIVE New York , Sept. 10 , 1974 rub off on a great deal of our lessthan-confident politicians and business people. , Maybe then we ? would get this country ' moving again . PETER M. HAMILTON Stony Brook , L. I. ; Sept. " 9 , 1974 ? To the Editor : When he pardoned Richard M. Nixon , President Ford , of course , had no precedent to guide him in the treatment of a President who had resigned his office rather than , face impeachment , removal and possible civil and criminal prosecution . But certain general principles should have been , in his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that he ' was acting in a dual capacity , judicial and executive . He was a judge , in effect , when he dismissed ' charges ' that had not even been formally brought , although they surely would have been . And he was also us- , ing the executive power to pardon . Herman Melville a century ago in his novel " White Jacket " put the case perfectly , although he was treating the matter . of shipboard " justice " in the 19th century Navy . He wrote : " If there are three things opposed to the genius of the American Constitution , they are these : iriesponsibility in a judge , unlimited discretionary authority in an executive , and the union- of -. an irresponsible judge and an unlimited , , executive . ih one person . "  --  ? , BLAIR CLARK ' ? Princeton ; N. J. , Sept. 10 , 1974 ? To the Editor : Our outrage at Nixon 's pardon should not lead us to let his henchmen escape trial . Excusing them would amount to accepting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could have ' questioned and refused orders and could have resigned , like terHorst . Instead ' they prepared plans and took initiatives within the over-all policy of espionage and cover-up . Trying them would also permit more of the facts to come out , which we need more than any specific vengeance . LUTHER P. CARPENTER New York , Sept. 10 , 1974 No one in ' the administration cares to point out that fuel and utilities rose nearly 80 per cent in price over this past year . Yet many owners find themselves having to apply one-third of a year 's rent to heat an apartment , not to mention having to cope with large expenses for labor and taxes . I believe it is time to stop relying on political convenience to solve the problems of housing in New York . The answer is an economically viable rent structure , not more government-subsidized housing units that do not even go on the tax rolls . If we do not act immediately , next year may be too late . . EDWARD SULZBERGER President Metropolitan Fair Rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the C.I.A . To the Editor : ? Your Sept. 16 editorial " The C.I.A . in Chile " places , major emphasis on an alleged quotation of . my use of the word " destabilization . " This word appears in Representative Harrington 's letter which discussed my testimony before the House Armed Services Committee . When this story first appeared , I reexamined the transcript of the testimony and determined that the word " destabilize , " in ' whatever grammatical form , does not ' appear . I so informed your representative , at that time , and I so stated publicly on Sept. 13 at a public meeting , attended by Representative Harrington , which was fully covered ' by your rep. , resentative . To insure that no mere difference in semantics is involved , I added that " this term especially is not a fair description of our national policy . front ' 1971 on of encouraging the continued existence of democratic forces looking toward future elections , " Your editorial views on this matter are , of course , a matter for you alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion that I said something which I had taken pains to deny say ; ing without giving any indication of such denial . W. E. CoLBY Director , Central Intelligence Agency Washington , Sept. 16 , 1974 ? Inflation ; The Action Gap To the . Editor : , The meeting of the - economists at the White House the other day ; produced a generally favorable ' com- , , , ment from the ? press , which noted : . rightly that something - Approaching a consensus existed among ? those as-1 sembled , As , a professional economist and participant , 1 found this reaction agreeable . I wonder , however , if more percipient , . reporting woifld not have examined ' the approved ' conclusion a bit more closely . The business before the . meeting was how to end inflation or , anyhow , to bring it under Control . The consensus was for easing the money supply , which , however desirable on other grounds , would , In the accepted view , do nothing to arrest ' price increases and would in fact make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be reduced . The econontiSts , with few exceptions , did ' not react " to this remedy at ' all : Most , one ' imagines , " thought it a conventionepiety . A tax increase , which would be a substitute both for tight money and ' iniaChievable budget cuts ; ? had no support . Increased productivity , reform of government regulation so that it . does not enhance prices , improved competis tion were all urge . These tou are conventional pieties with no operative effect against inflation ' whatever . ? ? There was ' agreement that costshove inflation  --  the wage-price ' Spiral major cause of inflation and some agreement ' that it could not be stopped by conventional monetary or fiscal means . But Centrals Were sternly opposed . Nearly all said there should be patience ; but no one explained how the American people , for whom inflation is very unpleasant , are ' to be persuaded to the exercige of this virtue . I believe it fair to suggest ' indeed , I do not believe that anyone ' can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of measures ( or nonmeasures ) which would do ' nothing against inflation , on balance Make it worse . Maybe inflation will recede , cure itself . But inaction is not a policy which requires high-level guidance . JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH Cambridge , Mass. , Sept. 9 , 1974 ? Ode to New York To the Editor : New York , New York ! What a city ! I 've walked from Eighth Avenue to Lexington from 38th Street to 59th ? and was n't mugged once . The theater ' is exciting . The bus driver was sorry we did n't have the " exact change " and he asked the riders if anyone had change for our dollar . One man . did . The man at the , subway suggested a different route to Forest Hills , and we had to walk only a block ' to the tennis matches. , The cab drivers were polite . The restaurants  --  marvelous . What can he bad about a city that has Bloomingdale 's and The New York Times ? We had a wonderful week ! MARJORIE and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
