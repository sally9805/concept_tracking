. HENNY 71 ' 0UNGMAN ; who may be the greatest joke teller in the world , is certainly the world 's hardest-working comedian . Last year , at the age of seventy , Henny travelled half a million miles in the United States and Canada with his famous trademark , his fiddle ( Italian , nineteenth century ) ? which he holds under one arm while he 's working , and on which he occasionally plays a few bars of " Smoke Gets in Your Eyes " ? to do more than two hundred and twenty engagements . He does engagements in top night clubs in Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Montreal , and Chicago ; talk-show guest shots with Johnny Carson , 11 ? 1ery Griffin , and Mike Douglas ; appearances on network variety shows , roasts , and specials ; performances on cruises to the West Indies and the coast of Mexico ; and scores of one-nighters and other one-shot outings  --  sales meetings , conventions , breakfasts , lunches , banquets , country clubs , colleges , hotels , synagogues , concerts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his local appearances , which include everything from taping gags for New York Telephone 's Dial-A-Joke ( one message unit gets you a minute of comedy ) to shooting thirty-second TV spots for Korvettes ' big Thanksgiving Day sale . " Nothing is too remote , " Henny says . " I can go anywhere , play any date , for any kind of people . " This yeas , Henny is working even harder , which means he is constantly on the phone to Sadie Youngman , his wife of forty-nine years , in Miami Beach , who keeps track of his schedule ( his own files are the pockets of his suit jackets ; his fiddle case is his briefcase ) , and to the Concierge answering service , in New York ( the operators have instructions to answer the phone " Henny Youngman , King of the One-Liners " ) , to see who wants HURR Y , HUR RY ! him where and when and for how much . When a phone rings in Henny 's vicinity , he 's likely to yell , " Answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's phone number is listed in the Manhattan directory ; he does n't want to be hard to get hold of . His fees are negotiable . " See what they 'll spend , " he says . " ' What 'll you take ? ' ' What can you afford ? ' You do n't turn it down if it 's within reason . If you turn it down , you do n't get it back anymore . And sometimes what they offer is more than you would have asked . " " Within reason " generally means a minimum of twenty-five hundred dollars , and that means you can hire Henny for a lot less than the minimum of twenty-Ave thousand dollars Carson and Bob Hope are said to get for a single appearance . But Henny makes a nice living ; his annual income is invariably well into six figures . " If I played the fiddle any better , " he says , " I 'd be making a hundred and twenty-five dollars a week .

Henny invests whatever he can in property . " Every time I ever bought property , I made a buck , so when somebody talks me into it I do it . " He says that the property , clomortgaged , will be his legacy to his family ; he also has a son , Gary , who , at thirty-seven , has been a successful New York film editor for the last sixteen years and has just finished directing his first feature film ?

Benny maintains a comfortable apartment in a midtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris theatrical agency are across the street ; when the agency moved in , some years ago , Henny put a sign in his living-room window that read " WELCOME WILLIAM MORRIS . BOOK THY NEIGHBOR . " He also rents an apartment in Miami Beach , and he has a ninety-nine-acre country place in Woodstock , New York , which he almost never visits . " There 's animals there , " he says . " I 'm afraid to go there . I think there 's bears . I know there 's deers . " Henny likes city settings , much preferring to spend his time in restaurants , clubs , or hotels  --  places with plenty of telephones . Henny 's other heavy investment is in his own business . " I 've got more agents than the I.R.S. , " he likes to say , but he enjoys acting as his own agent , and spends more than ten thousand dollars a year on phone calls- c ? ffing up bookers all over the country , for instance , to tell them that Youngman will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once a printer , is also the Youngman public-relations man , and himself sends out to a long list of agents , friends , columnists , and fellow-comedians frequent promotional mailings that he has designed , either announcing upcoming dates or reprinting rave reviews with gag headlines ( " A SPLASH WITH THE AQUACADE-I 'VE BEEN HELD UNDER FOR ANOTHER TWO WEEKS " ) . Ile also designs his own eye-catching stationery : yellow envelopes that say " envelope " on them in large orange sans-serif letters ; white envelopes with photos of Henny and his fiddle and the caption " If you do n't open this envelope , I 'll play in your ear .... " While most of his contemporaries in the joke-telling business  --  comedians like Milton Berle and Jackie Gleason  --  have gone into elegant semi-retirement and spend a good deal of time prowling around big houses in California or Florida , Henny , as Henny Youngman 's manager , is still actively buying jokes every week . He estimates that in forty years of buying jokes he 's laid out at least a quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : unbelievable because Henny can tell six or seven jokes a minute , which means that he knows over fifteen hundred jokes  --  and all of them guaranteed surefire , because jokes that falter are retired immediately . " Jokes cost money , " he says . " You do n't get them that easy . Two pages of special material can cost fifteen hundred dollars , and that 's only six minutes ' worth of jokes . You got ta take care of your business , or you got ta worry . When you 're on that stage , no one can help you . A stage is only thirty square feet . Any stage . So where the hell can you go ? Cheap comedians never invest a nickel in the business . Nobody 's paid his dues like I have . " Hennv works on his stock every day , testing new material on anyone who phones , and improving his delivery . He 's always working , every time he tells a joke , to eliminate even one unnecessary word though he may have told the gag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fighting trim , gives his audiences quick release at every performance , and insures that no audience of his will ever have to get angry waiting for a punch line . Which may explain why , at almost seventy-two , Henny Youngman is by his own admission a contented man and looks like the freshest face in the business . HENNY 'S a big man , of Charles de Gaullean proportions . He is six feet two inches tall , has a healthy girth he pretends to worry about , and walks with a stately , measured , slightly forward-tilted , faintly pigeon-toed gait . He is always dressed in a suit and tie , which usually means , specifically , a white shirt , black shoes and socks , a conservatively tailored business suit with an unexpectedly gaudy silk lining ( " I fell through an awning and decided to keep it " ) , a blinding tie , and a Dimeand-pin . With a dress suit , when he 's working an evening engagement , he wears silk braces embroidered with the Hebrew characters for " kosher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a street , Carnegie Hall , any telephone conversation  --  even a waiter at the Friars Club , his favorite New York lunch haunt , two and a half blocks east of his apartment . Fourteen years ago , when most comedians were heading out of town for keeps , Henny moved into Manhattan from Brooklyn . " There 's a million chances in New York , " he says . " Who wants to make it in California ? It 's so smoggy the rainbows are in black and white . " " Hurry , hurry ! This way to the Midway . " That 's Henny strolling from his place to the Friars Club for lunch . He 's working the street , even though for the moment I 'm his only audience . Con Ed is tearing up part of the street . " The Mayor 's kid lost a hall ! " Henny yells . A pigeon swoops low off a perch on St. Thomas 's Episcopal Church . " Any messages ? " Henny asks . The signboard in front of the church says " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind , " Henny tells the signboard . We pass a large hole in the ground where hardhats are laying the foundation for an office building . " You tore down the wrong building , dummkopfs ! " Henny shouts down the hole . The hardhats look up , startled , then wave , and make violin-playing motions , and one of them yells back , " Take my wife  --  please ! " ( Henny 's most famous one-liner  --  the best four-word joke in the language , a joke so compact it has a punch word instead of a punch line . ) A jogger plows by . Henny swings an arm like a checkered flag . " The winner ! " he yells . The jogger breaks stride and then continues without looking back . The New York Friars Club is a spacious collegiate-Gothic town house with a good kitchen and a mixed **25;5569;TOOLONG membership . There 's a large round table just to the right of the entrance to the dining room  --  an ideal spot for Henny to tummle the lunch crowd and the waiters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system connected to the club switchboard , and one of the messages it broadcasts most frequently is " Phone call for Friar Henny Youngman . " And there 's an extension phone on the wall next to the round table , so Henny has everything he needs . " Hurry , hurry ! " That 's Henny entering the dining room . " Cheer up ! Say hello to Joey Adams  --  he used to be somebody . Goodbye , Joey  --  we 'll talk about you as soon as you leave . You must remember this " ? he breaks into song ? " il knish is just a knish . " He spots a waiter . " Have you got a little orange juice you 're not using ; And bring me some matzos . But do n't charge me . You 've got to remind them you 're here , or they just stand around .

And fill it with orange juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals , has invited me and a couple of his old pals , Alex Rose and Fred Harris , to lunch . Alex Rose is an inventor and a former court reporter . He invented the Pocket Jester , a tape measure with sixty Henny Youngman jokes printed on it instead of inches ; he invented an ashtray with a built-in snuffer ; he invented the Typatune , a musical typewriter when you punch the keys , it plays melodies . The Japanese are interested in marketing the Typatune , but Rose says he does n't have the time to work with them an it . He is the author of several books , includ ing " Memoirs of a Heterosexual . " He 's a small man who wears a watch chain across the top of his vest . He once took accordion lessons secretly five hours a day for seven months in order to sur-prise his wife . Fred Harris is an elegant man who wears pearl-gray waistcoats . He manages the singer Cleo Laine and hooks acts . Harris has just returned from two days of trout fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Catskills , where he hooked a sixteen-incher . Back before the Second World War , Harris had a dance act , and played in every country in Europe except Russia ( Russia being strictly a circus country ) . Rose and Henny met in the early thirties . Harris and Henny go back to 1934 , when they both worked in a show called " Vaudeville , U.S.A. " " Henny was the tall , skinny kid , " Harris says . " Like he is now . " An out-of-work comedian approaches the table . " How are you , Henny Youngman ? " " A little louder , please , " Henny says . " How 's your wife ? " says the comic . " Expensive . Pal , you 're full of it . You never got more laughs on the stage than Berle or me . No regards ! ' Sotto voce to Harris : " Only way to cheer him up . He ought to go to work again . Then he wo n't feel bad . " " Phone call for Friar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks up the phone . It 's the secretary of an agent Henny called this morning when he got up . ( Henny generally gets up around ten and immediately puts in an hour on the phones . He likes to turn in around 2 A.m . ) " He 's tied up ? " Henny says into the phone . " Well , untie him .... Hello ? ... A little synagogue in Buffalo wants me September 27th ? Wait a minute ! ' Henny puts on a pair of black-rimmed glasses , pulls a handful of business cards , gag cards , encashed checks , and letters from a jacket pocket , and scribbles a note on the back of a " Pride and Joy " card . ( You ask someone " Have I shown you my pride and joy ? " and produce the card , face down . Then you turn up the card , which has a color snapshot of a bottle of Pride furniture wax and a bottle of Joy detergent . ) " Get a deposit . And I got ta have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act if I got ta cancel . " After Henny hangs up , he tells Rose , " You got ta do your homework in this business . I believe in letting people know at all times that I 'm in business , I 'm around . I 'm alive . I got a job today ! " he shouts . " We 're going to live ! " Henny is happy if he gets at least ten bookings a month . " If it 's dignified , take it , " he says to Harris . " My business is the worst  --  there are just so many jobs . Very rough . I try to talk people out of going into it . A cantor called me up this morning . Making fifteen thousand a year . Wants to get into show business . I said , ' Do n't leave the job . Hold on to the job . ' It 's very peculiar , very treacherous . If a comedian goes to a cheap place , it do n't look good . You have to turn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starving , because then they 'll see you 're desperate . It 's different for a singer  --  if he has a hot record , he can take a job in a joint in Brooklyn without looking cheap . And then Eve weeks later he 's playing a local joint on Long Island and bouncing every nickel . " A man Henny and Harris both know approaches the table and whispers urgently in Henny 's ear for a minute . " I do n't care what you say , " Henny says , picking up a butter knife and buttering his own wrist . The man laughs and walks away . " To hear him is to hug him , " Henny tells Harris . A waiter brings Henny , who is supposedly on a diet most of the time , a chef 's salad . " What kind of dressing do you want ? " he asks . " I 'm not going to tell , " Henny says . " I 'm no rat . " " Enjoy your lunch , " the waiter says . " How 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it ? " " How do jokes work ? " I ask Henny . He says , " For me , every joke is really a cartoon  --  you can see it . Like : A man says to another man , ' Can you tell me how to get to Central . Park ? ' No . ' ' All right , I 'll mug you here . ' Or : Two guys in a gym , one putting on a girdle . ' Since when have you been wearing a girdle ? ' ' Since my wife found it in the glove compartment of our car . ' If it 's too tough to visualize , or it 's not part of your life , what the hell good is it ? I picked out what I liked , because it was natural to me . I forgot about the sophisticates years ago -- I tried smart comedy ; people would n't believe it of me . I play for the masses . I tell easy jokes  --  you do n't have to think . My jokes happen to everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're plain , they make people laugh . But you got ta have a few laughs . If you ca n't get a Few laughs , what good is it ? And nobody knows these jokes . The average gun never heard them . " " Want a little grapefruit ? " Henny asks . " It 's good for you . Purifies your blood . " A half grapefruit arrives at the table . " Ca n't you get the bottom half ? " he asks the waiter . Henny orders coffee  --  he drinks a lot of coffee , rarely drinks alcohol , does n't smoke . He does n't gamble , either , for that matter . HENNY has been in show business forty-six years now . Ho got his big break forty years ago , when , without an audition , he was signed to do a six-minute spot on Kate Smith 's radio show . The first night he went on , he went over so big that Ted Collins , Kate Smith 's manager , who produced the show , let him stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henny 's delivery was even more rapid-fire then than it is now , he used up a hundred jokes  --  just about all the jokes he had managed to accumulate at the time . " My whole life is a dream world , " Benny says . " I do n't know what the hell happened unless you tell me some dates . After that first show , Ted Collins came to me with a contract to be a regular and asked me , " Where 's the rest of your material and your writers ? ' I said , ' Who ? Where ? What material ? ' I was a greenhorn . I came out of left field . I did n't even know enough to imitate anybody . I was n't trained . I was n't taught . But overnight I became a star , so I hadda learn the business . I got two hundred and fifty dollars for that first show . My mother said , ' Since when have you been funny ? ' I showed her the check . " Learning the business meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started paying made him , as it turned out much later , something like the godfather of the TV sitcom : aspiring young comedians like Red Buttons and Jan Murray glued their ears to radios to take down what Henny said and study the way he said it , and the young comedy writers who got their start writing one-liners for Benny subsequently went out to Hollywood and wrote shows like " Julia , " " My Friend Irma , " and " The Lucy Show . " One of Henny 's writers , Harry Crane , went no to become head writer on " The Dean Martin Show ; " another , Snag Verris , later wrote for Sinatra . Benny also bought jokes from Morey Amster-clam . Norman Lear , then another young writer , once sold him a comedy song . Al Schwartz , Henny 's first writer , who is now living in Los Angeles and is writing " All in the Family " scripts , maintains that Henny has " discovered and launched the careers of more comedy writers than any other comedian in the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Take my writers  --  please ! ' They went on  --  and he went on . He survived it . " Al Schwartz , who comes from a comedy-wiitipg family ( one brother , Sherwood Schwartz , created and wrote " Gilligan 's Island , " and he and a second brother , Elroy Schwartz , have written for " The Brady Bunch " ) , first went to Hollywood himself in 1937 , and he put in thirteen years as head writer for Bob Hope 's radio show . Afterward , Schwartz was hack and forth between the coasts : he spent three years writing Jackie Gleason 's " The Honeymooners , " three years on " The Lucy Show , " and another three years on Red Skelton 's show  --  where he won an Emmy  --  before becoming the story consultant for " Petticoat Junction , " in 1964 . He went to work for Benny just before " The Kate Smith Show , " when Henny was working the Yacht Club , a night spot on The Street , as it was known  --  Fiftysecond between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many night clubs it was practically a wholesale comedy district . The " 21 " Club , which now takes itself more seriously , is the only survivor of The Street 's thirties nightlife . Sch warm was fresh out of law school at the time . He gave his diploma to his mother , and Henny paid him twenty dollars a week to sit upstairs at the Yacht Club in a little office and write gags ( like " Last night I baited a mousetrap with a picture of cheese . I caught a picture of a mouse " ) , which Henny then immediately delivered downstairs . Schwartz and Henny have kept in touch ever since , and I got a chance to talk with Schwartz in the lobby of the Beverly Rodeo Hotel , in Beverly Hills , when I flew out to Hollywood with Henn ) , on the occasion of his appearing in one scene of a movie that has n't gone anywhere ? " Won Ton Ton , the Dog Who Saved Hollywood . " Henny had only about a dozen lines in the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to star in a picture someday . He 'd also like to have his own TV show , and he may get one ; he told me that Mickey Rooney wants to produce a TV pilot called " Zeli 's Deli , " a sort of Yiddish " Duffy 's Tavern , " starring Benny as a delicatessen host . And Henny would like to star in a Broadway show , either a comedy or a serious play . Henny once had a serious part in a " U.S. Steel Hour " playing a broken-down comedian , and got good reviews . Penny invariably stays at the Beverly Rodeo Hotel when he 's in Los Angeles . It 's a small , comfortable hotel about half a block away from the Beverly Wilshire  --  the hotel Henny invariably stayed at until it took out its all-night drugstore . " That was a wonderful drugstore , " he likes to say . " You could meet people there . You could meet everybody there . Then they closed it down and made it into a bookstore . Christ ! " Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his movements . " When Henny got ' The Kate Smith Show , ' my salary immediately went up from twenty dollars a week to thirty-five , " Schwartz told me as we sat in the Beverly Rodeo lobby . ( Henny had gone up to his room to make some phone calls . ) " Henny had been playing club after club before Kate Smith . Those are the learning days for young comedians . They get material , For one thing . A lot of Henny 's jokes come from trying to eat off club dates in Newark ur Paterson or outside Providence . ' I wo n't say business was had at the last place I played , but the band was playing " Tea for One . " ' And Fellow called up and said , " What time is the next show ? " I said , " Wrhat time can you make it ? " ' That overnight-success stuff is crap . When you start , you 're fighting the world to make a niche for yourself . Henny used a cigar in his act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't a comic unless you had a cigar sticking out of your face . He started making the violin important on The Kate Smith Show . ' He 'd do music for breaks . Do fast lines and play lousy  --  one phrase of ' Smoke Gets in Your Eyes ' and then : ' Folks , you wanta drive somebody crazy ? Send him a telegram that says " IGNORE FIRST WIRE . " ' From the beginning , Henny was known for his speed . Eddie Cantor had started patter comedy ; previously , comedians had worked slow , like Jolson , Bob Hope spread speed  --  while the audience is laughing at the first joke , the comedian is halfway through the second joke . This was very important for radio . If you 've got an eight-minute spot , you can only tell Eve long stories . But if you can cut an anecdote down to a three-liner , you can , like Henny , do fifty or more jokes in eight minutes . To me , this is generosity in a comedian . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , a bathing suit , your wife , your doctor , a horse race , the World Series . All the things that are already on people 's minds . Henny 's never had time , in segueing from one topic to the next , to say anything except something fast : Folks , my timing is off lately . When I sit down to eat , I get sexy . When I go to bed , I get hungry . People are crazy these days ! I saw a man lying in the street . I said , " Can I help you ? " He said , " No , I just found a parking space and sent my wife to buy a car . " Just murderous what 's going on with people today ! One fellow says , " I have n't tasted food in a week . " I said , " Do n't worry . It tastes the same . " All right , rolling along ! I love this crowd ! ' Some people in the business used to put Henny down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the outside , a natural , a Grandma Moses . Well , some of those people do n't exist anymore , and Henny 's rolling along . For a fellow on the outside , he 's doing pretty good . All performers are exhibitionists , but Henny 's not a tease . He gives value . And he 's not only generous with his material , he 's a profes-sional  --  and a professional just does n't give up on a tough audience . He knows he 'll nail ' em someplace . So if the act 's not clicking , Henny will shift material in mid-act , go with the more solid material  --  maybe the mother-in-law . ' I have a mother-in-law that 's nearsighted . Yesterday she spent twenty minutes nagging a coatrack . ' Henny knows exactly what he 's doing when he bounces around from one thing to the next . " Henny always gives a solid perfortnance  --  he 's always reliable . One comedian I worked for disappeared for two days during rehearsal once ; it turned out he was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy who ran it a hundred dollars and told him not to stop . Henry does n't do nasty material ; he never attacks people  --  only the archetypes bubbling right under the surface . He does n't do ' anti ' jokes ; he does n't get into politics . Political jokes divide an audience , get people nervous . He stays away from all X-rated material ; he stays clean . A short joke has to be very strong it ca n't he a thin , watery joke . Henny 's jokes are as compressed , as vivid as any dream material . He builds imagery . It 's there . You can picture the whole thing . ' She was bowlegged , he was knock-kneed . When they stood together , they spelled " ox . " ' That 's a great , great classic  --  another joke , like Take my wife  --  pleasel ; where the punch Line , what we call the stress , is compressed into one word . " Henny 's a natural ad-libber . ' Take my wife  --  plea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This sets him off from a great comedian like Milton Berle , who 's a good memorizer , with a mind like a computer . Milton , I think , was contrived into being a comic by his mother . Henny just wanted it by himself  --  he was determined . Know what you want to do , and give it a chance . He 's the same fellow he was forty years ago . Oh , he 's slowed down a little , so the audience could catch up to him . He kind of laughs at himself a little now ; he sometimes bows after a punch line , to show that he knows they know the joke , too  --  he 's developed a warmth . Milton became an uncle early . Henny became an uncle later . To audiences now , he 's an old friend , the way Jimmy Durance was . And others are discovering , forty years after I did , that he can be a good friend . When I came out here to the Coast to work for Hope , Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Henny , who was pretty broke himself just at that moment , bought me a suit with practically his last forty dollars . Other comedians have trademarks. jack Benny was tightfisted ; Dean Martin 's right ; Hope was always chasing girls . But Henny 's just funny . " WHILE we were in Hollywood for the shooting of Henny 's " Wen Ton Ton " scene , Jackie Glea-son was over at the Fox Studios tap-ing a rare TV appearance on a Lucille Ball comedy special . Henny took me and a friend of his , Zeke Manners Manners had the first country-andWestern show on New York radio , in the thirties and forties , and he wrote " Pennsylvania Polka "  - -  - over to say hello to the Great One , who was in the studio building , sitting in front of his dressing room , a giant Sportscoach camper with a California license plate on the back that said " GREAT ONE .

He 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't seen each other in years , sat down in a couple of lawn chairs on a green AstroTurf lawn in front of the camper and started gabbing .

" I was doing so had I was going to have a bump put in my nose , I would make up at home and then walk the eight blocks to the theatre nice and slow , so everyone would know I was an actor . Then I 'd go into Kellogg 's Cafeteria , in Manhattan , for a bite . The way to avoid the check was , you 'd finish your grapefruit and go to the front and tell the cashier , ' The who 's going to wave will pay check . ' Then you 'd wave bye-bye to your friends . Someone always waved back . " " Oh , my , " said Henny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more gullible than anyone , " said Manners . " It was a Broadway philosophy that no matter what you did , if you had a grapefruit at 4:30 A.M. you 'd be healthy . ' The conversation had begun in whispers , but as Gleason and Youngman warmed up they began to speak in their normal onstage voices . Suddenly , Lucy yelled from the set , Sltlui , t. , up ! Go outside if you want to holler . " The noise level dropped for a minute . Then the two ex-Brooklyners ( Gleason lives in Florida ) traded stores about friends who 'd had nose jobs , about gags they 'd pulled , about joints they 'd played . " Various rumors come back from New York , " Gleason said . " Henny 's doing sensational  --  he 's got a cruise . " " Jackie 's got a beautiful home , " /lenity said . " Chandeliers , a lovely game room with a beautiful blackjack table , slot machine , backgammon . " " Next time you 're down there , look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henny , I want to go back to work .

ON a second outing I made with Henny , the two of us met at seven o'clock on a Monday morning in January in Chicago , outside the Merchandise Mart , the largest wholesale marketplace in the world , and a holding of the Kennedy family . Henny was about to play an 8 A.M. date at the Mart 's M &; M Club before a breakfast audience of five hundred buyers of china , glass , giftware , and collectibles from six hundred miles or so around Chicago , who were attending a semiannual International Decorative Accessories Center show .

The ad , which Henny wrote , says " HAVE JOKES , WILL TRAVEL LET HENNY YOUNGMAN PERK UP YOUR EVENT . " Henny brought only his fiddle with him into Chicago for the I.D.A.C. job ; he 'd checked the rest of his luggage at O'Hare Airport . The previous day , he 'd worked before a thousand at a breakfast in Houston put on by Leonard Goldstein , president of the Biddle Purchasing Company , and he 'd flown from there to Los Angeles to tape a bit for an Alan King comedy special .

" Winchell , Damon Runyon , all the columnists  --  you could n't meet those guys in the daytime , so we had to go toLindy 's , where jimmy Cannon , the press agents , anyone who could n't sleep nights hung out . And after Lindy 's closed , at four , WTinchell went over to an all-night drugstore at Fifty-first and Seventh until six . The whole angle at Lindy 's was to get a mention in Winchell 's column five days in a row  --  that was like having a hit record . " Inside the M &; M Club , an enormous room , the waitresses were finishing their breakfasts ; the buyers would n't be arriving for another few minutes . " Who 's got the hot coffee ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought Henny and me coffee and asked him for his autograph , announcing , " You 're one of the most talented men in the world . " " You 're beautiful , Miss , " Henny said . " Or am I too late to call you Miss ? Got any money saved ? " " How come you 're up so early , Henny ? " the waitress said . Henny said , " Once in a while , we get one of these . You got ta get up and do it if you get no sleep , the hell with it . That way , you build a good reputation . They know you 're reliable . " To me , Henny stage-whispered , " I used to get these waitresses crazy . I 'd do a little mind reading . I 'd get to the job ahead of time , scout nut and find out things about four or five of them from another waitress , so I was always right . " Buyers began arriving  --  lots of buyers . There were over a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred , so the start of the show was delayed until , almost eight-thirty . " All man rushes in , says , " Take this watch , oil it , clean it , fix the mainspring , put a new band on , adjust the timing , clean the glass , I 'll he back in half an hour , " and slams the door . The jeweller looks up and says , " C-c-c-c-come in . " Two men are talking . One says , " I just lost my third wife . " " What happened to the first ? " " She died from eating poisoned mushrooms . " " And the second ? " " She died from eating poisoned mushrooms . " " What happened to the third ? " " Skull fracture . " " How come ? " " She would n't eat the poisoned mushrooms . " A man calls up a lawyer 's . " Good morning , Schwartz , Schwartz , Schwartz Schwartz . " " Let me speak to Mr. Schwartz . " " Mr. Schwartz is in Cleveland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , let me speak to Mr. Schwartz . " " Mr. Schwartz has retired  --  he 's no longer with us . " " Well , let me speak with Mr. Schwartz . " " I 'm sorry , Mr. Schwartz is in court  --  he 'll be out all day . " " Well , let me speak to Mr. Schwartz . " " Speaking . " All three jokes were big hits , and after that Henny clearly could have stayed on for an hour . When he did stop , after fifteen minutes , he got an ovation . Benny , in high good humor , bounced up and told me , " Ali right , break it up . Walk out quietly . Go get your coat . I 'll call Sadie . Hurry , hurry ! " A woman stopped his forward modon and said , " That was like wine , Mr. Youngman ! " " We got ta stop meeting like this , " Henny said . Mr. Wylie gave Henny a check for a thousand dollars ; the deal Henn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , air fare to and from the Coast , no expenses . Henny 's plan for the rest of the day called for relaxation . This meant : a fast tour of the Merchandise Mart ; phone calls ad lib ; lunch at his friend Eli Schulman 's steak house with Bob Dachman , executive director of the Little City Foundation , a charity Henny sponsors , which helps blind and retarded children ; a visit to Eli himself , who was laid up in the hospital recuperating from an operation ; a fast tour of Chicago ; a bus to the airport ; a plane back to New York ; dinner with some friends . We got into a crowded Merchandise Mart elevator . As soon as the doors closed , Henny said , " Everybody breathe in . Second floor , notions , sundries , accessories , ladies ' lingerie . " Upstairs , we checked out at least fifty I.D.A.C. display areas . " Let 's make a few bucks ! " Henny shouted to the exhibitors . He bowed to one booth . " A Japanese firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Any mail for me ? " " Who do you know who can write ? " said the mailman . " I 'll tell the jokes , " said Henny . At a candle display , Henny scored a clown candle for himself and a mouse candle for me . Henny likes clown artifacts . I got to carry both of them . He exchanged greetings with all the concessionai res . " Hello , Mr. Youngman , " a young woman said . " Hello , Beautiful . Got any money saved ? " Henny went into an office behind one I.D.A.C. display to make his calls . Sadie was in Miami Beach : " Hello , Sweetheart , I just did the breakfast . It turned out nice . They laughed at the jokes about you .... You should n't do that , dear . Order and have them deliver ... Who wo n't deliver ? Go to the Epicure . " On our way to the next booth , Henny looked down at his shoes and laughed . " I was in such a hurry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoelaces . " We dropped in on a Benny pal  --  Harry Finkel , leasing director of the Merchandise Mart and its adjoining Apparel Center , who sells all the space in the **34;5654;TOOLONG complex . Harry has a WATS line , so Henny called Sadie again , this time for free . " Is Mrs. Youngman there ? ... Oh , she 's still out shoplifting ? I 'll call later . " After lunch , Henny got Bob nach-man to take the two of us to North-western University Hospital to visit Eli Schulman , who was lying in bed with his legs in the air  --  a captive audience . The hook-wagon lady rolled by , and Henny asked , " Got any pornographic books ? " Eli admired a bracelet Hen-ny was wearing . " Sadie gave it to me . Of course , I keep up the pay-ments . " The phone by Eli 's bed rang . " It may he for me , Eli . " Then Rach-man drove us around town , and Benny talked about playing Chicago joints in the thirties . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customers were looking around for the tight way to end the evening and no one listened to the jokes . There was a job at the Paramount , a gambling place , where everyone laughed , and after Henny worked the first of two weeks the manager said , " I got ta let you go . " " I thought I was a hit . " " That 's just it . Everyone 's coming in to listen to you ; no one 's gambling . " Henny had a room at the Croydon , a theatrical boarding house . The Stroud twins , who had a comedy act , took two bedrooms with an adjoining bath . One of them would take a girl up to his room , and after a couple of hours would excuse himself to go to the bathroom . A couple of minutes later , his brother would come out of the bathroom and hop into bed with the girl . " There was a guy with a cane at the Croydon . Every day , I sneaked into his room and cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guy used to go around saying , ' I ca n't understand it -- I 'm getting taller . ' You do these things when you 're hard up Once , I tried to get arrested in Chicago . T wore a nature-boy outfit on Michigan Avenue . I figured it would make the front page . A cop took one look at me and said , Get the hell out of here . ' " When the stewardess folded down the tray tables in front of us to serve dinner on the plane back to New York , Henny tucked his napkin under his chin , looked back at the day so far , and sang , to the tune of " Three Blind Mice , " " Three free meals ! Three free meals ! " The next day , at the Friars Club at lunchtime , another comedian , Gene Baylos , came up to the round table and said , " Chicago was good ? " " It 's always good , " Henny said . " Gene , the idea is  --  get the job , get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did a benefit years ago in New Jersey , finished at just the right moment , got a standing ovation . Then the sponsor  --  he was drunk  --  came over and said , ' I want you to mention my wife . I 'll give you five hundred extra . ' So I went back and said , ' Wait a minute , folks , I forgot to tell you " HENNY YOUNGMAN speaks a little Norwegian . He grew up in a Norwegian and Irish section of Bay Ridge , in Brooklyn . Like Abe Beame , he was horn in London and moved to New Yolk within his first six months . His father , Yonkel Yungman , was a hatmaker who loved opera . He left Friedrichstadt , Russia , in the eighteen-nineties for Paris to avoid being drafted by the Czar . In Paris , he got a job in the claque at the Opera for two francs a night . Yungman changed his name to Jacob Youngman about 1 893 and moved to Whitechapel , in the East End of London , where lie joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had . His father was also in the hat business . Once in London , Jake Youngman decided to move to New York , and when he got here he lived in a Mills Hotel on the lower East Side for twenty-five cents a day , found a job ments . Hen attended P.S. 2 , about five blocks away from home , and was thrown out of class a lot for saying funny things . " I was a troublemaker , " he says . " But I was never funny at home . There was no reason for it . I 'd just go in and eat my meals . " The Youngmans were one of only two Jewish families on their block . One day , a big Irish kid tried to grab Hen 's violin case on the street , and Hen knocked the kid out with a lucky punch . Other big kids in the neighborhood wanted him to be a fighter , but he got knocked out in the first round of his first fight , and after that he went out for track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any city have two alternatives , " Henny says . " They can stand and fight or they can learn to run very fast . Running is safer . " Henny went to Manual Training High School for a couple of years , acted up regularly in class , was told to go to the Detention Room , and instead cut out and went to shows at four vaudeville houses near the school  --  the Orphcum , the Fox , the Flatbush , and the Prospect . Then he 'd go try out the jokes he 'd picked up there on some older neighborhood kids who hung out in a candy store . Putting together a borrowed routine , he started making appearances at political clubs and block dances . He played fiddle for a while in the pit of a movie theatre owned by his Uncle Morris , and then started playing , for three dollars a week , in a small pickup combo at the Thursday-night socials at Manua/ Training High . " One night , we had two drummers , a trumpet player , and me on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was booking contestants for amateur nights signed He up for an appearance as a comedian at the Sixteenth Street Theatre The night he went on happened to be Yom Kippur , and , although he kept his stage debut a secret from his family , he made the mistake of bragging to his friends , and Jake got wind of it and turned up at the theatre with a cop in the middle of Hen 's first stage appearance anywhere and yanked him off the stage . Jake eventually decided that Hen was n't going to turn into a Met violinist . Hen was thrown out of Manual High for foaling around , and since he liked books , Jake entered him in the Brooklyn Vocational School to learn printing . Jake 's dream now was that Hen would grow up to own his own printing plant and print magazines like The Literary Digest and St. Nicholas . Hen put together his own band- ? one of the boys was Mike Riley , who later wrote " The Music Goes ' Round and ' Round " ? variously called the Swaney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five , and the Coney Island Ramblers , depending on where they were booked . They usually practiced on the subway on their way home from a date . They got four and a half dollars an engagement . Hen took an after-school job printing business cards and letterheads with a printer who had a booth at Kresge 's ; when there was no trade , Hen printed up jokes that ran in Variety every week under the heading " Released Jokes . " Hen thought these were jokes that comedians were no longer using . What Variety meant was that the jokes were so old they should he put out to pasture . Hen developed a secret crush on a soft-spoken Irish girl who sold sheet music and records across the aisle at Kresge 's , but he did n't dare ask her out , in case his mother might hear about it . He also had a job serving summonses , at fifty cents per service . One practiced summons dodger he nabhcd had a store with a phone up front near the window . Hen called him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lewis ? I 've got some money for you . Hold the phone a minute , " and then , while the man held the phone , ran across the street and served the summons . When Hen finally got up enough nerve to ask the Irish girl at Kresge 's her name , it turned out to he Sadie Cohen , so he showed her a dance program he was going to play in Manhattan , and invited her to come along . " I was afraid of him , " Sadie said at Henry and Sadie 's New York apartment the other day . " He was so tall . And he told me I should n't have any more boyfriends except him . I thought , If he is n't nice , I can go home . Dad " ? Sadie calls Henny " Dad " ? " told to meet him at Broadway and Forty-second . I 'd never been to Manhattan before . When I got there , he greeted me with a kiss . I said , ' How can you do this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been out with a few schoolmates before Henny , and I have n't been out with many other men since . I came from a very orthodox house ; my father thought actors were burns . We lived on Chauncey Street , in Flatbush  --  the same street Jackie Gleason 's family lived on . On our block , we were the only Jewish family  --  the Protestants lived on one side of the street , the Catholics on the other . " Henny , who calls Sadie " my million-dollar baby before taxes , " said , " She was goyish . To this day , her family do n't know what I do . " Sadie was the baby girl of a family of four boys and three girls . 11 er father , who came to the United States from Austria , made men 's trousers ; he was the first man on his block to buy a crystal chandelier , and lie also had an upright piano and an Edison phonograph . He died when Sadie was eleven . After graduating from high school , Sadie went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up orders  --  the only Jew in the office . A year later , she was transferred to the sheet-music section and met Henny . And got married and raised a family and allowed Henny to tell jokes about her . Both of her children , Gary and Marilyn , are soft-spoken , like her ; her grandson , Larry Kelly ( Marilyn 's husband was Jack Kelly , Frank Sinatra 's pianist ) , is bubbly , like his grandpa . " My grandfather has only ever given me one piece of advice , " Larry says . " ' Stay on phones ' ? it 's the only way to run a business . " Henny and Sadie 's New York apartment is an unbelievable place  --  or , rather , it 's an altogether believable place with two unbelievable areas . The living room , bedroom , and kitchen are attractive and normal  --  in the living room , there 's a twenty-seven-inch color TV , a number of family pictures , a needlepoint copy of Chagall 's famous fiddler on the roof , a pineapple chandelier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raspberry-sherbet-red carpet , and half a dozen clown paintings , including one of Henny dressed as a clown ; in the kitchen , there 's a profile snapshot of Henny pasted to the refrigerator ( Sadie 's way of reminding Henny about his weight ) . Disbelief centers on Henny 's desk , in the dining alcove off the living room , which supports a gorgeous mound of letters , notes , hills , memos , records , cards , phone hooks , Sunday papers , newspaper clippings , magazines , books , printed flyers at least twenty layers deep , and Henny 's telephone , with three different trunk lines ; and on Henny 's unique tchotchke room . Tch otc h k es are stuff  --  toys , playthings , according to " Mainly for ' Goyim , ' " by Sam A. Shaw , a seventy-page Yiddish lexicon , which Henny gave me soon after we first met . Henny has , stuffed into one room , box upon box and shelf upon shelf full of attention-commanding knickknacks and gag items , most of them small enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three-quarters inches long ( " Have you seen what the Arabs have done to our money ? ' ' ) ; business cards that say " MY CARD " ( " Have I ever given you my card ? " ) ; small cards made of hard-to-rip paper which say " This Magic Card can be torn ONLY by a VIRGIN ; " paper wings that can be attached to dollar hills ; checks one and a half inches by four and a half inches ( " Can you cash a small check ? " ) ; pocket spotlights ( " Take a little how " ) ; Dime-and-pins ; red stickers for liquor bottles which say " WA RNING ! THE CONTENTS OF THIS DRINK MAY CAUSE INTERCOURSE ; " black-bordered cards that say " Very Sorry ! AT MY AGE I CA N'T TAKE Yes FOR AN ANSWER ; " a hook of one-liners ( eleven pages with one line drawn on each ) ; signs that say in tiny type " This sign is " and in huge type " FOR SALE ; " business cards printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deem it a favor if you and your party will pay the bill and quietly leave the premises . " Henny also keeps all his stationery and flyers in his tchotchke room , and eight-by-ten glossies of himself with fiddles , copies of some of the joke books he 's published ( " Henny Youngman 's Greatest One-Liners " ) , and a few copies of a couple of hard-tocome-by record albums ? " The Primitive Sounds of Henny Youngman " and " Sol Hurok Does Not Present Henny Youngman . " He 's particularly proud of the tiny ten-dollar bills : " I bought out a musician . I 'm the only guy who 's got ' em . " IN the late twenties , not long before Henny and Sadie got married , Henny and his cousin Jimmy Kaplan , who wanted to he a comedian , took the Swanee Syncopaters up to the Swan Lake Inn , a hotel in the Catskills co-owned by several of Henny 's old grade-school teachers . Lewis Kerner , a friend of Henny 's , remembers working with him in the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director and now owns The Colony , a modular mobile-home community near Palm Desert , California , which is often called the first trailer park for the affluent . Like Al Schwartz , Lew Kerner is one of the people Henny makes a point of always getting hold of when he 's in the neighborhood . I met Kerner when Henny and I were in Los Angeles for Henny 's movie and he decided to fly down to Palm Desert for a day to visit another friend , a man who 'd had a stroke , and to talk to some local developers shout a scheme of theirs to build on a lot that Henny owns in Palm Desert . Kerner was wearing white pants , white sweat socks , white tie-moccasins , and no shirt , and he was supervising half a dozen long-haired kids who were building a concrete-block foundation for one of his trailers . Kerner stuck his right hand out to Henny for a shake . Henny removed a ring from his right little finger and shook hands . " Henny , boy , " said Kerner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss a film deal with Run Run Shaw , a famous Kung Fu movie director , " you 've come home . " Ker-ner invited us to have a drink in the bar of The Colony 's clubhouse ; the bar is lined with the wood-panelled lockers of members  --  people like Los Angeles Sheriff Peter Pitchess , Joe Pasternak , and Mrs. George Randolph Hearst , Sr. " Schmooze and booze make good Jews , " Kerner said . " Mountain audi-ences were terribly demanding , " he went on . " They 'd seen everything . Tough . You learned early in life to entertain these people . You learned about business , about how to take care of yourself , about comedy , about values , about theatre . Jack Albertson , Red Buttons , Phil Silvers , Danny Kaye , Moss Hart  --  they all came from the mountains . And everyone fighting to top everyone else  --  as everyone says , it was the greatest training ground in the world for comedians . You had to have lines for all the guests at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , was that the room was too small . So we 'd tell ' em , My room 's so small it has a three-cent stamp for a rug . ' That 's where all the hotel jokes started . The idea was to get a laugh and get out of the vicinity . And you had to have something going on all day long , even if it meant build-ing a fire in the goddam lobby . They 'd come for a week , Sunday night was check-in . Monday night  --  campfire , marshmallow roast , jokes . Tuesday was vaudeville night . Wednesday night , cabaret  --  we 'd have to tell jokes . Thursday there 'd be a masquerade , and Thursday was topsy-turvy night  --  we got the guests to do the waiting and cleaning up , and the management saved money . Friday night there was a drathe subway home and print the cards , then nip hack to the eateries to make delivery . Then , to avoid the long ride back to Bay Ridge , he 'd go sleep for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , The Cohens lived in downtown Brooklyn . They were not amused . " It was n't that they did n't like me , " Henny explained in his autobiography . " How could you like a guy who was running around all night till three or four in the morning and then woke you up to ask if he could spend the night The Cohens could n't . Henny later moved his printing press to Manhattan  --  first to a booth in a penny arcade on Fourteenth Street near the Academy of Music , so he could try and persuade a faster-moving bunch of actors and musicians that they needed business cards . Henny had a sign over his booth that read " HENNY YOUNGMAN  --  PRINCE OF PRINTERS . " He always offered half off to anyone who would let him print " HENNY YOUNGMAN  --  FUNNY VIOLINIST " on the reverse of a card . As business improved , he moved to a midtown booth in the middle of a penny arcade on Sixth Avenue between Forty-fifth and Forty-sixth , right near every major theatre in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . The Sixth Avenue arcade was where Henny met Berle . Henny would throw gag lines at passersby , and one day Berle , who was already doing all right in a vaudeville show on Broadway , was the passerby . Berle stopped and said Youngman was using a Berle joke . The big change for Henny during this period was that he switched from bandleader to full-time stand-up comic ; the turning point came at the Nut Club , in Mountainside , New Jersey , when the manager needed a last-minute fill-in for his stars , the comedy dance team of Grace and Paul Hartman , one night when they did n't show up . The manager implored his bandleader  --  Henny to go on and tell some of the jokes he 'd been cracking during rehearsal . The manager actually said , as Henny remembers it , " You 've got ta save my life . " Of course , a big crowd came in that night and loved Henny , and he was on his way to the Yacht Club , the Kate Smith show , Dial-A-Joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berle started throwing whatever he did n't have time for to Henny  --  hr mitzvahs , a summer job as part-time social director and tummIer at a hotel in Lake Hopatcong , New Jersey , a booking at a five-show-a-night club called Gallagher 's  --  and , forty-odd years later , Berle still tends to think of Henny , very stubborn , he 's high-tempered , although he will listen to me . " One time , Youngman was pla ) ing a club date at the Waldorf  --  good fee , sixty-five hundred people . He finishes , gets in the elevator , presses the button , and takes it down to the wrong floor by mistake . Gets out , sees a hotel billboard that says something like ' Mr. and Mrs. Charles Levy announce the Bar Mitzvah of their son  --  Room 205 . ' Youngman goes to 205 . ' Is Mr. Levy here. ? Hello , Mr. Levy ? I 'm Henny Youngman . Want me to do about fifteen minutes ' So he picks up another hundred and fifty dollars and goes home . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " two years , and then he got the idea that if he could he released from his contract , Hollywood offers would pour in . In 1938 , he found a couple of ex-burlesque comedians , Abbott and Costello , who had a wow routine at Locw 's State called " Who 's on First ? , " to take his place on the radio program  --  a year and a half later , when they. , in their turn , left Kate Smith , they went out to Hollywood and got into pictures immediately  --  and got his release . But no offers came through for Benny , and instead of making a grand a week he was out of work and turning down offers that paid less than his radio salary . After ten weeks of this , he figured he 'd lost ten thousand dollars . Then Chuck Green , a friend of his who sold diamond rings to actors , took him to Lindy 's and told him that either he should tip the ante and tell himself he 'd lost a hundred thousand for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or he should figure . that he had lost thirty-five hundred , since there hundred and fifty a week was what he could reasonably expect to he earning in a New York club . Benny has n't set prices since . Two weeks later , he took a six-week job at Billy Rose 's Cast Mariana at three hundred and fifty a week . Rose told him that the smartest thing he could do was become a specialist in one thing  --  stand-up comedy and stick to that . After the Casa Mariana job , Henny started taking jobs all over the country . " I used to cry on the train , and kept asking myself , Where am I going ? ' Then all of a sudden I was making a grand a week again , and I started taking the whole family along  --  Mom , Lester , Sadie , Marilyn , and Gary . All the mone ) went for transportation . I was afraid to go alone , I guess . " But Benny kept moving , and he 's been peripatetic ever since travelling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play the mediator between Dorsey and his singer , Frank Sinatra ) , ranging as far afield as the London Palladium , playing Las Vegas every year ( " the only town in the world where you can have a good time without enjoying yourself " ) . He lost two Las Vegas jobs at once when he was working a club and the management asked him , as a favor , to take over Mario Lanza 's shows at another place at the same time . ( Lanza had developed a case of flop sweat , as it 's called in the business . ) The second club offered Henny an extra thousand a week to break his contract and come work for them , and he refused . Henny , who thought he ought to get paid double for working two shows at the same time , told the first club he deserved more money . The first club dared him to quit ; Henny got mad and did just that . " Do n't do business when you 're angry , " he says now . Henny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was kept off Ed Sullivan 's old TV show for five years after Sullivan insisted on cutting a few gags from Henny 's routine in dress rehearsal ; since Henny did n't dare tell Sullivan to go to hell , he omitted the gags , but he was so mad that when he went on the air his timing was off and he bombed . It was at about this time that some other comedians began to crack , " Everyone 's trying to get on TV , and Youngman 's still trying to get on the radio . " But in the last ten years , starting with Rowan and Martin 's " Laugh-In , " which was a solid hour of oncliners ( a concept that Henny says he had tried unsuccessfully to peddle to the networks ten years previously ) , Henny has really come into his own . Three years ago , he was the first comedian on Dial-A-Joke , and got three million calls , including transoceanic calls from Australia , the month he was working . ( No other comedian has topped this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great demand ; he 's even getting movie parts  --  in addition to the part in " Won Ton Ton , " he has a bit in Mel Brooks 's " Silent Movie . " Two years ago , he taped a show for Home Box Office 's hot cable-TV showcasing of comedians . Sid Garfield , a top publicity man at CBS and a longtime observer of show business , says that Henny is only just now becoming a superstar . " He 's arrived at the point of tremendous credibility , " Garfield says . " I think Henny 's long overdue . " Superstar or not , Henny will still do anything for a gag . A few years ago , he came out of ABC one night , onto Sixth Avenue , in pouring rain . No cabs in sight . A Sixth Avenue bus driver recognized him and stopped : " Hey , Henny , what are you doing here ? " " Same as you . Listen , pal , will you do me a favor and take me over to the Carnegie Deli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung off his bus route , and deposited Henny at the door , Henny 's topper ? He got off the bus and said , " Pick me up in twenty minutes . " HENNY called up the other evening  --  Sadie was down in Florida  --  and imited me over . We sat around drinking 7-L.Tp and watching " The Mery Griffin Show . " Henny was on the phone when I got there , talking to a friend who 'd just had a stroke . " It 's all right , " Henny told him . " You 're still alive . I have a good time when I 'm alive . I 'll be over tomorrow . Get some broads . Goodbye . " Linda Hopkins belted out a number on Mery Griffin 's show . " What 's she screaming for ? " Henny asked . " She got the job . " Henny fished an ice cube out of his glass and put it on the back of the fingers of his left hand , " Look , " he said " Liz Taylor ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said , " I 've been forty-six years in the business so far . All by luck . It 's a miracle career , because really I never planned it . I worry about my family and about paying bills , but I 've got no problems at all , come to think of it . Come on , let 's go get a plate of ice c ream . " Henny rang his answering service while I put on my jacket . " I 'll call in every twenty minutes , " he said .
