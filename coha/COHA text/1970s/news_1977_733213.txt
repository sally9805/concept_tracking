txt Letters Letters Power Supply : Britain 's ' Better System ' To the Editor . New York City 's second blackout in 11 years has anti-technology elements of our society calling for a change in our way of life . Our problem lies in our past , not in our technology . U. S. power systems developed wherever large populations existed in this huge country . System interconnections are affairs of convenience , virtually unregulated . Utilities are privately owned , profit-oriented , operating for the purpose of selling as much electricity as possible to the largest concentrated market . Formerly Consolidated Edison 's location was the envy of the industry . Now the tables are turned . Peter Kihss 's July 18 news article describes Con Ed 's distribution system so well that the readers should clearly understand its philosophy of operation . While it is true that it has tried to give a sufficient and growing supply . of electricity to New Yorkers , it is also apparent that profit is its only motivation . We are told that the standby reserves of power were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repair or operate . Furthermore we are told that much of Consolidated Edison 's power comes from outside the system , because it is cheaper . Then there is the matter of the circuit protection system which Consolidated Edison seems to have chosen to protect its equipment but not to prevent blackouts . Because power can be produced cheaper outside the system , Consolidated Edison will continue to buy power , and once again the producers can shed their loads , leaving Consolidated Edison at the mercy of an expensive dtandby system . A model for a better system exists in Britain 's Central Electricity Generation Board . The British have the good fortune , from an electrical distribution point of view , to have a small island with large concentrations of population , thus permitting a national grid system to have developed naturally since 1930 . Today 's Central Electricity Generation Board has 137 power plants feeding into a massive ring main . Blackouts are no threat to London or other English cities .

To cut arms because of influencepeddling is unacceptable . But giving Seoul arms just to substitute for our withdrawal is little better . Are arms a sop or a need ? The probability is they will serve less to block invasion than to scare a basically weaker North Korea into getting those most modern , powerful Soviet weapons which Moscow has so far not allowed her . Seoul will then scream anew for our best . Such buildup in an already arms-sodden penin- : sula without U.S. tactical control over R.O.K. forces means more danger , less restraint .

" A penny dug up thousands of years from now will tell a great deal about the people in the year the penny was minted . It was a civilization that believed in one God ( " In God We Trust " ) . It worked with metals ( copper ) . It had a calendar , an alphabet , a number system . It was a democracy ( " Liberty " ) with a leader ( Lincoln ) . It had a coinage system ( One Cent ) . It was made up of many small states that were able to live in harmony with one another and it was educated enough to use the ancient language of the Romans ( " E Pluribus Unum " ) . It modeled its official buildings on the architecture of the ancient Greeks . Perhaps some university thousands of years from now will have studies on an ancient civilization that existed in what was once the United States of America .

Exponents of our capitalistic freemarket concepts say Consolidated Edison acted in behalf of its stockholders in adhering to the profit motive by opting for a less expensive alternative , but in the light of the human misery and suffering that temporary losses of electrical power bring , New York Americans have a right to seek a better answer . An integrated regional system under , the firm control of a politically free authority could regulate and control the system . Unfortunately this concept could now only be installed by political action . As with other aspects of the " good life " today , technology has not broken down . Our political system is at fault . Engineers and managers have not failed , but it is the politicians who do not understand their responsibilities and duties to their constituents . A. E.

The catastrophic consequences of the blackout demand that this be a matter of highest priority . There is no need for extensive studies to prove that Con Edison 's system is neither technologically nor perception of whether the arms are legitimate need or augmented threat . Since Pyongyang will talk to us but not to Seoul , we should talk to reinstitute the arms-control provisions of the 1953 Armistice Agreement or reasonable substitutes therefor . Provision must be made for Seoul to attend in some capacity as soon as possible . But we must take responsibility for the agreement our generals , not Seoul 's , signed . Seoul-Pyongyang talks are theoretically preferable . Since they appear impossible , Washington-Pyongyang talks are better than a third or fourth round of a mindless peninsular arms race . Seoul must understand such talks will benefit her as our ally . Pyongyang must understand that if no progress is made we will reconsider our troop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENDERSON Fletcher School , Tufts University Medford , Mass. , Aug. 2 , 1977 Jaworski 's ' Rescue ' To the Editor .

Kent Compromise To the Editor : Perhaps if the new gym at Kent State would be named in honor of the students killed , the protestors would accept the building . MOLLIE TARTER Tupper Lake , N.Y. , Aug. 2 , 1977 humanly infallible . The welfare of the world 's center of activity must not depend upon the timeliness and accuracy with which Con Edison 's controller twists the dials . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed increasingly larger generators , and now Con Edison is dependent on each of its power plants to provide a significant amount of its electrical supply . A defect in the operation of any one of these generators causes operational problems . A few years ago we were exposed to the ills of Big Allis . Lately we have learned that the vaunted nuclear plants at Indian Point can produce a cheaper kilowatt but they have rarely been operable . Con Edison must , therefore , rely heavily on the purchase of power from other utilities and , in a pinch , on obsolete plants and on gas turbine generators that are expensive to operate . There is , therefore , a need for the development of supplemental and alternate sources of electricity in the city . This can best be achieved by having all major building developments include their own electric generators , whose hot water discharge would be used to provide needed heat . The City Planning Commission 's decision to permit Battery Park City to have its buildings heated by electricity from Con Edison should be reversed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans for a generator that would both provide electricity and make use of the waste heat , as proposed by President Carter . The Convention Center must have its own generator . Co-op City 's facilities for an electric generator should be utilized . These and many other similar sources of electricity would add to the total supply , help conserve energy and provide some protection from total blackouts . The city must reinstate a hot line with Con Edison and have an emergency plan to put into operation upon notice of an imminent brownout that may lead to blackouts . The city must monitor Con Edison 's available generating capacity and its programs of maintenance and improvement . This can not be left to Albany or Washington . All that is needed as a basis for action has long been known . There is no need to waste time in rhetoric .

The House vs. the ' Most Basic Human Right ' To the Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Peoples House . By its action this week in voting against abortion aid for victims of rape and incest , it has lost its right to that great title . When I was working on antirape legislation and the establishment of a rape-prevention center in the last Congress , I had occasion to talk with several young women who had been victims of rape and who became pregnant . I wish every member of the House who voted against this help would take the time to see what happens to these young people , and what will happen to them and the babies they bear as a result of rape if they can not afford abortions . This is striking at the most basic human right . Can it be that my former colleagues are willing to turn their backs on a few women who have no political punch in order to please a highly organized group ? ? It 's my hope that the House will find a way to give these unfortunate , violated young women another chance . For those of us who love the dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PETER A. PEYSER Irvington , N.Y. , Aug. 3 , 1977 Of Peddlers and Taxes To the Editor : Is n't it surprising that New York City and New York State authorities continue to ignore the sales-tax revenues they are losing when merchandise is purchased from street-corner peddlers and weekend flea markets rather than legitimate retail establishments ? It is a situation that can be corrected with either more vigorous enforcement of present regulations or new legislation that will plug up the loophole . BURTON K. ADELMAN President , M. H. Lamston , Inc . New York , Aug. 3 , 1977 Before We Give More Arms to Seoul To Identify Handguns To the Editor . Identification of handguns and rifles would be made easier if Federal and state legislation were enacted which required all manufacturers of guns to test-fire each gun and microfilm the bullet markings , which would then be sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for indexing and filing . Guns which are already in the possession of licensed persons would be required to be test-fired at the next renewal of license or permit . ROLAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
