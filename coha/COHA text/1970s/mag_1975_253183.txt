Facing a thatchwood wall in a mod African conference hall , a gathering of key Protestant and Eastern Orthodox leaders from six continents and four races last week sang and clapped to the accompaniment of a jazz combo , recited the Lord 's Prayer simultaneously in a Pentecost of languages , then paraded out into the Nairobi night for an informal session of Christmas caroling . <P> Despite those exuberant closing moments , however , the fifth septennial assembly of the World Council of Churches was a hesitant gathering at an uneasy time . Just before it opened , Founding Father W.A. Visser ' t Hooft remarked : " If the meeting does not produce a new sense of purpose and dynamism , the council will be in trouble . It is time the churches stop looking at the council as a sort of fringe phenomenon . " Last week , as the assembly ended , TIME 's Religion Editor Richard Ostling cabled from Nairobi that the World Council is in as much danger as ever of being on the fringe . Ostling 's report : <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 500 million non-Roman Catholic Christians round the world , but the ecumenical elite that runs it has only the loosest links with that increasingly restive constituency . Moreover , the council has been accused of " selective indignation , " flogging capitalists in general and the U.S. in particular while ignoring evils elsewhere . <P> The problem has intensified ever since 1961 , when the Russian Orthodox Church joined the council . There was a tacit agreement to spare the delegates from Moscow any embarrassment , and Soviet sins have gone unnoticed . One Nairobi delegate , Scottish Episcopal Priest Richard Holloway , has called the attitude a " conspiracy of silence . " <P> Smuggled Plea . The 18-day Nairobi assembly , the first held in Africa , presented an ideal opportunity to end that conspiracy . As the 2,300 churchmen poured into Nairobi , arms from the Soviet Union and the troops of its allies were pouring into Angola . But when the assembly came to making a statement against meddling in Angola , it pointed a finger of blame only at South Africa . <P> Similarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin American nations but failed to attack repression of liberties in either the Soviet Union or several nations of Black Africa . In fact , the delegates were forced to face the question of Soviet repression principally by a gutsy Nairobi-based Christian newspaper , Target , which printed a smuggled plea to the World Council from Moscow Priest Gleb Yakunin and Layman Lev Regelson . The pair complained that the council had made no protest when " the Russian Orthodox Church was half destroyed " in the early 1960s , and pleaded for a crusade against persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union . <P> For two weeks , assembly leaders kept a move to criticize the Soviet Union from getting to the floor . But then in the final days an innocuous resolution praising the Helsinki Agreement of last August rekindled the issue . Jacques Rossel of the Swiss Protestant Church Federation proposed an amendment expressing concern over religious repression , " especially in the U.S.S.R. , " and asking that country to honor its Helsinki pledges of freedom of conscience .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
