txt Joseph A. Califano Jr. , the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , told Congress today that the Carter Administration would eventually like to make a permanent part of the Social Security system the limited transfer of general revenues from the Treasury that it proposed yesterday for an experimental five-year period . Mr. Califano stressed the belief that such shifts , for years of high unemployment , were fundamentally sound . His comments were made to a skeptical House Social Security subcommittee in an apparent effort to show that the Administration was not rushing headlong into a break with tradition for temporary , expedient reasons . President Carter sent Congress a package of proposals yesterday that he said would eliminate the growing deficits in Social Security financing for the rest of this century . Stormy Course Foreseen The probing and anxious questions by members of both parties in the subcommittee and criticism emerging from the business community , plus the heavy workload facing the subcommittee 's parent body , the Ways and Means Committee , all pointed to a stormy course for the Carter package on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple expedients might he the limit of action this year , with a full-scale review in 1978 . Opposition by business was particularly strong , with some executives describing the plan as a thinly disguised surcharge on business profits . Page Dl Since it was authorized in 1936 , the Social Security system has been self-financing . It has paid benefits  --  now going to more than 33 million Americans each month  --  out of Social Security payroll taxes . Employers and employees have paid equal taxes on a limited wage base . now $16,500 a year . Each pays a rate of 5.85 percent . Mr. Carter proposed to abolish that wage-base limit for employers so that they would pay taxes on all wages and salaries , to make small increases in the wage base on which workers are taxed and to shift Treasury revenues to the Social Security system for years in which unemployment exceeds 6 percent . ' Small Company Problems Republican Representatives William M. Ketchum of California and Richard T. Schulze of Pennsylvania said that the heavier employer taxes would he most burdensome for small companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a White House briefing . " There 's no way an employer can he made to absorb the tax out of profits , " Mr. Schulze said . " His cost of business rises and he passes it on . " Mr. Califano expressed the hope that competition would " hold prices to some degree . " But Representative Al Ullman , Oregon Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , expressed profound reservations about the Adminis // tration proposals , as did a senior Republican member of the subcommittee , Bill Archer of Texas . Mr. Ullman expressed opposition to the transfer of general revenues , saying : " We do n't want to make a welfare program out of the Social Security system . That 's always the danger . " Similarly , Mr. Archer warned " of the destruction of the insurance character of the system , " although he acknowledged that it had never been run according to conventional insurance principles . Sweetening of Benefits Basically , the system has been one of payments by working persons to the elderly . Most people get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Social Security tax payments , gone to a private insurance company . This is partly because Congress has repeatedly sweetened benefits , sometimes without raising payroll taxes . Mr. Ullman , interviewed on the CBS Morning News , also expressed dislike for moving away , at least now , from the practice of equal tax payments by employer and worker . Stressing that the Ways and Means Committee had energy taxes , welfare reform and tax reform to grapple with this year , Mr. Ullman suggested that fundamental changes in the Social Security system might be better put off to 1978 . In the meantime , he said , Congress could " add a small layer of new taxes " by raising the wage base " and possibly the rates ' and by shifting money among the several Social Security trust funds . Link to Hospital Costs The Administration itself has proposed a shift from the health insurance fund , a shift Mr. Califano acknowledged was premised on enactment of the separate proposal to limit increases in hospitalcare costs . Mr. Ullman also exPessed the view that Congress had " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as an alternative to higher Social Security payroll taxes would still put the burden on " that average guy . " He suggested , instead , " some kind of a transaction tax , " in Europe called a value-added tax , " in the stream of ' industry " with , " necessities " excluded . Representative James A. Burke , Democrat of Massachusetts , the subcommittee chairman , said that the panel would be unable to start hearings on the Social Security proposals for at least two weeks . Mr. Califano made dear that the Administration did not regard its proposal as one of general contributions from the Treasury but rather one of occasional help to offset the effects of a weak economy . He said repeatedly that unemployment had averaged more than 6 percent only four times since World War H ? in 1958 , 1961 , 1975 and 1976 . With the rate in April at 7 pert t , this shapes up as a fifth such year .                  @ @ @
