txt BRASILIA  --  Twenty years ago Brazil did something no nation in the modern world has ever done  --  it sent its government into the wilderness in search of the future . President Juscelino Kubitschek 's idea was both outrageous and brilliant ? he would build a new capital from scratch . Brasilia , as the nation 's newborn seat of power was to be called , would be the genesis of a new Brazil . By relocating its political heart in the desolate , unpopulated savannah , Kubitschek and a handful of other visionaries reasoned , Brazil would sow the seeds of evolution in a previously neglected expanse of land twice the size of Western Europe . It 's been 13 years since Brasilia rose out of the red earth of the Goias plain , since the jaguars , snakes , and tapirs retreated deeper into the jungle in the face of man 's intrusion . At the time , many politicians were furious over having to abandon the seductive eleSouth America is a continent that is as diverse as it is huge . To study that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Yates and , photographer Val Mazzenga spent two months journeying through eight countries .

BUT BRASILIA . a city of - 800.000 that looks as if it belongs in another galaxy , is here to stay . Jor some the marble and glass buildings , the fountains , . concrete arches and enigmatic sculptures seem out of place in the red ' dust ' of the interior . For some the city is sterile and cold . But for most Brazilians , their Buck Rogers-type capital is a symbol of the brash imagination of which this potential super-power is capable . " Who ever heard of a modern nation simply picking up and moving every branch of government 600 mile s away onto an uninhabited plain ? " asked Geraldo Azerado , a Rio restaurateur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil will thank President Kubitschek . " Perhaps .

THERE ARE only 42,000 miles of paved roads in Brazil , less than the total miles of roads the U.S. had in 1840 , yet Sao Paulo , South America 's largest city , dwarfs Chicago 's skyline in numbers of skyscrapers .

It moves to a samba beat . Its people save their money for the annual carnival blowout , do business on the beaches and cherish the proverb , " We progress at night when politicians sleep . " It is by far the continent 's dominant nation . It is a land ruled by the military but run by civilians . Fourteen years after the coup that installed the military government , Brazil 's police still arrest political prisoners and occasionally torture them . But most Brazilians seem unaffected and untroubled by this . A housewife explained : " There 's enormous freedom . You can say and do what you want ? so long as you do n't do it in public and it does n't get into the papers .

For two of those hours , passengers look down on nothing but jungle ? the Amazon , which takes up half the country . Brazil imports 80 per cent of its oil but , has recovered from the 1973 oil embargo through a giant do-it-yourself program that has led it to produce at home many of the products that it formerly imported . Once the leading Latin American target for U.S. aid ? it received $367 million in 1966 ? it receives only $100,000 a year now and will get none at all after 1980 .

" " Of all the places I 've ever been , the one that has the most dynamic internal growth , the one that 's going to be very hard to stop , is Brazil , " says Prof. Arnold C. Harberger , chairman of the University of Chicago 's economics department . The government itself is " authoritarian , not a dictatorship , " says Oliveiros Silva Ferreira , editor of the Sao Paulo newspaper , 0 Estado , a frequent critic of the regime . " There are free elections at local levels and some freedom of the press . We have laws . But the president can change the constitution at whim .

" But democracy seems to have shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care whether we have a civilian or military government , so long as it looks after the economy . " Brazil , unlike the rest of South America , was colonized by Portugal and speaks Portuguese . The Portuguese did not plunder the country or murder its Indians , as the Spaniards did in their half of the continent . Rather , the Portuguese intermarried with the Indians and the slaves they brought from Africa . Brazil today includes every conceivable shading of skin and there is a casual , unselfconscious mixing of races perhaps unique in the world . THE PORTUGUESE also made Brazil the world 's biggest Catholic nation . The Africans brought voodoo , which , mixed with Catholicism , is alive and well here . And Geisel , the president , is a Lutheran . Economically and politically , Brazil bestrides South America . It borders on every nation except Ecuador and Chile . Its economy is mightier than those of Venezeula , Argentina , and Peru combined . With more than 100 million people , it is the seventh largest nation in the world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the fastest growing . Like most South American nations , its population is bunched along the coast , where 70 per cent live . Ninety per cent of Brazil is uninhabited or belongs to Indian tribes speaking 30 different tongues . Rio de Janeiro is probably South America 's most beautiful city . Sao Paulo is the business capital of the continent , with self-made tycoons in walled mansions . The houses can cost $1 million or more and a three-bedroom apartment along the beach in Rio 's Leblon district can rent for $2,000 a month . But in the northeast , the city of Salvador is closer to Africa  --  geographically , spiritually and economically  --  than to Florida . Near Recife are cane-cutters barely surviving on $2 a day ; their sons flee the plantations for the relative affluence of slums around Sao Paulo . This singular nation is governed by the military , which overthrew the chaotic , free-spending government of President Joao G o u l a r t in 1964 , and now ranks , with Paraguay , as the most durable regime in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to civilian rule before 1983 at the earliest . At the *start , the military government was one of the continent 's most repressive . Geisel has followed a policy of " decompression "  --  a slow , erratic lifting of repression , tolerating some criticism and political ferment . WHEN GEISEL allowed relatively free parliamentary elections in 1974 , the only legal opposition party , the Brazilian Democratic Movement MDB won a solid victory . Only the fact that just onethird of the seats were being contested kept the MDB from winning control of Parliament . This halted decompression for a while . But the next year , Vladimir Herzog , a Sao Paulo television newsman , was tortured to death while being questioned in a military prison . The ensuing outcry led to reforms in police and prison methods and no prisoner is believed to have been killed since . then . But more parliamentary elections are due this November . Another MDB victory could have left Geisel 's party , the National Renewal Alliance ARENA , in the minority . So Geisel , exercising his right of decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARENA will keep control , no matter how the people vote . ' le did this by ruling that a third of the Senate will always be elected by special colleges leaded with ARENA supporters  --  in effect , they will be appointed by Geisel . He also banned political campaigning from radio and televison . The reaction to these so-called " April Reforms " was instantaneous and negative . Students demonstrated . Newspapers editr , rialized . Even businessmen , a pillar of the regime , made critical speeches . IN THE FACE of this , Geisel resumed the uneven decompression . Bishops of the Catholic Church publicly urge reforms . Some newspapers openly criticize the government . while others are cowed into silence . Police have raided universities , while allowing protest meetings like a recent Herzog memorial to go undisturbed . Parliament . suspended in April , has resumed but makes few waves . Political arrests go on . Amnesty International estimates there are up to 300 political prisoners here . Fifteen former prisoners issued an open letter alleging torture in jail  --  and most of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last fall took what may have been the most important and liberal political step since 1964 . He fired his war minister , Gen. Silvio Frota , a spokesman for hard-liners , because of his outspoken opposition to the government 's more liberal moves and to the " Communist " tendencies he saw in the government . After the firing , Frota first attempted a coup , which Geisel thwarted . Then he issued a public statement , attacking Geisel for being soft on Communism and for abandoning the anti-Communist aims of the 1964 coup . THE ARMY remained united behind Geisel  --  a key point in a nation where military unity is considered vital to stability . Frets had been a leading candidate to succeed Geisel when Parliament selects a new president for four years in the autumn . His dismissal left the field to the " liberal " candidate , Gen. Joao de Figueiredo , head of the National Information Service , Brazil 's equivalent of the CIA . This means the military will run Brazil until at least 1983 . But although the government remains firmly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out their welcome . " I supported the revolution , " newspaperman Alberto Dinas says . " It was necessary for the military to take over . But they should have organized things and then got out . After 14 years of suffering , I 'm not supporting one more day of this revolution . " Much antigovernment sentiment focuses on " Institutional Act No. 5 "  --  the law permitting the president to act by decree , overruling the constitution at will . Critics of the government see this as an unacceptable whiff of dictatorship . But , curiously , the same critics say that " Al5 " as it is called , would be acceptable if it were formally embodied into the constitution . Thursday : Argentina . a country that lost its way . is politically repressed and economically battered .
