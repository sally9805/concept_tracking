DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY <P> Directed by JOHN HOUGH Screenplay by LEIGH CHAPMAN and ANTONIO SANTEAN <P> Greetings to Peter Fonda , the old Easy Rider himself , who has slipped back into the driver 's seat . This time around , he has four wheels instead of two and plays a heist artist with racing ambitions instead of a romantic outlaw biker . Fonda has dreams of glory on the fast track . To get himself a stake in the big time , he knocks over a large super market in a small California town . <P> Aiding him is a mechanic-pal named Deke ( Adam Roarke ) , a barely reformed rummy who could go round the bend any minute . Only a girl is required to round out this formula , and it must be said of Susan George that she rounds it out very nicely indeed . Miss George makes something of a specialty of playing pouty jailbait ( recall Straw Dogs ) , and she shows spunk-among other things-as she runs about in tight jeans and skimpy halters . <P> The movie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with this fractured gang taking it on the lam . They drive around back-country California thwarting attempts by the local constabulary to bring them to justice . Over a dozen police vehicles are put out of commission during the rigors of the pursuit , but no cop ever gets hurt . This lends the movie a trace of the fabulous , like some sort of STP fairy tale . For the trio , however , the moral is finally brutal and predictable . <P> Fonda cackles maniacally behind the wheel and seems to be enjoying himself . Director John Hough ( who engineered a good little thriller last year called The Legend of Hell House ) does not pay much attention to any of the obvious weaknesses of this rough road genre . What he depends on instead is its undeniable careless charm . J . C .
