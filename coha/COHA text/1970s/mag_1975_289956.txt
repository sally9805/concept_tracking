Despite its bloody , passion-inciting origins , the six-week trial had been surprisingly subdued . Few spectators were on hand ; until the end , the press was all but absent . Only last week did Room 303 of the Erie County courthouse in downtown Buffalo begin to fill . Representatives of the Six Nations Indian " family " occupied one row in the spectators gallery . Sketch artists and television reporters craned for a better view . Defense Attorneys Ramsey Clark and William Kunstler and their young convict clients sat at an L-shaped table scarcely five feet from Chief Prosecutor Louis Aidala . Sheriffs ' deputies and bailiffs stood poised to quell any disturbance . Outside , as many as 400 pickets marched in chilling rain and snow round the gray granite edifice . <P> Slow Judgment . The trial of John Hill ( part Mohawk Indian ) and Charley Joe Pernasilice ( part Catawba ) for murder and attempted murder was about to end , concluding a chapter of the American tragedy called Attica . But the end was slow in coming . It took three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of two blacks on the panel , finally announced the verdict on Saturday night . Hill was found guilty of murder . Pernasilice was found guilty of second degree attempted assault . The men 's lawyers promised to appeal . <P> Hill and Pernasilice had been accused of murdering Prison Guard William Quinn , who died of injuries suffered in a beating that occurred during the worst prison uprising in the nation 's history . At the time , Hill was in Attica for attempted assault , and Pernasilice was serving a sentence for possession of a stolen motorcycle . Quinn was one of 43 men ( eleven guards and 32 convicts ) who died as a result of the four-day riot in September 1971-most of them shot by state police when they stormed the maximum-security prison in upstate New York behind a fusillade of bullets . <P> By the time the trial of Hill and Pernasilice opened , Attica had become remote , if not forgotten . Few thought about this first major Attica trial , the other trials to follow and the added indictments that might yet be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell Means last year and the Chicago Seven in 1970 drew greater attention : " The case is too old . Attica is a painful subject , and most people want to stay away . " Yet Showman Kunstler could not resist the temptation to flay witnesses and have a go at State Supreme Court Justice Gilbert H. King , who presided firmly . " I 'm fed up with your telling me I have no conscience , " said King , rejecting one ill-timed Kunstler motion for dismissal . " I have as much conscience , I think , as you have . "
