MOTHER OHARE , big bosom for our hungry poets , pelvic saddle for our sexologists and Open Classroom theorists-0 houri O'Hare , who keeps her Perm-O-Pour Stoneglow thighs ajar to receive a generation of frustrated and unreadable novelists But wait a minute . It may be too early for the odes . Has it even been duly noted that O'Hare , which is an airport outside Chicago , is now the intellectual center of the United States ? Curious , but true . There at O'Hare , on any day , Monday through Friday , from September to June , they sit ... in row after Mies van der row of black vinyl and stainless-steel sling chairs ... amid soaring walls of plate glass ... from one-tenth to one-third of the literary notables of the United States . In October and April , the peak months , the figure goes up to one-half .

And if so , why ? Because writers head out into the land to give lectures . They are giving lectures at the colleges and universities of America 's heartland , which runs from Fort Lee , New Jersey , on the east to the Hollywood Freeway on the west . Giving lectures in the heartland is one of the lucrative dividends of being a noted writer in America . It is the writer 's faint approximation of , say , Joe Cocker 's $25,000 one-night stand at the West Springfield Fair . All the skyways to Lecture-land lead through O'Hare Airport . In short , up to one-half of our intellectual establishment sits outside of Chicago between planes . At a literary conference at Notre Dame , I ( no stranger to bountiful O'Hare myself ) ran into a poet who is noted for his verse celebrating the ecology , nee Nature . He lives in a dramatic house nailed together completely from uncut pieces of hickory driftwood , perched on a bluff overlooking the crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no closer than five miles to it by conventional automobile and barely within a mile-and-ahalf by Jeep .

" I would n't know , " he said . " I do all my writing in O'Hare . " And what is the message that the bards and sages of O'Hare bring to millions of college students in the vast fodderlands of the nation ? I 'm afraid I must report that it is a gloomy message ; morose , even , heading for gangrene. decline in economic growth is causing a crisis in capitalism , which will lead shortly to authoritarian rule and to a new America in which everyone waits , in horror , for the knock on the door in the dead of the night , the descent of the knout on the nape of the neck The Frisbee ion IF YOU HAPPEN TO attend a conference at which whole contingents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all its varieties in a short time .

The conference is about to begin . The students come surging in like hormones . You 've heard of rosy cheeks ? They have them ! Here they come , rosy-checked , laughing , with Shasta and 7-Up pumping through their veins , talking chipsy , flashing weatherproof smiles , bursting out of their down-filled Squaw Valley jackets and their blue jeans-0 immortal denim mons veneris ! looking , all of them , boys and girls , Jocks &; Buds &; Freaks , as if they spent the day hang-gliding and then made a Miller commercial at dusk and are now going to taper off with a little Culture before returning to the co-ed dorm . They grow quiet . The conference begins . The keynote speaker , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , informs them that the United States is " a leaden , life-denying society . " Over the next thirty-six hours , other O'Hare regulars fill in the rest : Sixty families control one-half the private wealth of America , and 200 corporations own two-thirds of the means of production . " A small group of nameless , faceless men " who avoid publicity the way a werewolf avoids the dawn now dominates American life . In America a man 's home is not his castle but merely " a gigantic listening device with a mortgage " ? a reference to eavesdropping by the FBI and the CIA . America 's foreign policy has been and continues to be based upon war , assassination , bribery , genocide , and the sabotage of democratic governments . " The new McCarthyism " ( Joe 's , not Gene 's ) is already upon us- Following a brief charade of free speech , the " gagging of the press " has resumed .

What further devastations or humiliations could possibly be in store , short of the sacking of Kansas City ? It was in that frame of mind that I attended the final panel discussion , which was entitled " The United States in the Year 2000 . " The prognosis was not good , as you can imagine . But I was totally unprepared for the astounding news brought by an ecologist . " I 'm not sure I want to be alive in the year 2000 , " he said , although he certainly looked lively enough at the moment . He was about thirty-eight , and he wore a Madras plaid cotton jacket and a Disco Magenta turtleneck jersey . It seemed that recent studies showed that , due to the rape of the atmosphere by aerosol spray users , by 2000 a certain ion would no longer be coming our way from the sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the magnesium ion , the neon ion , the gadolinium ion , the calcium ion ... the calcium ion perhaps ; in any event , it was crucial for the formation of bones , and by 2000 it would be no more . Could such a thing be ? Somehow this went beyond any of the horrors I was already imagining . I began free-associating . ... Suddenly I could see Lexington Avenue , near where I live in Manhattan . The presence of the storm troopers was the least of it . It was the look of ordinary citizens that was so horrible . Their bones were going . They were dissolving . Women who had once been . clicking and clogging down the Avenue up on five-inch platform soles , with their pants seams smartly cleaving their declivities , were now mere denim &; patent-leather blobs ... oozing and inching and suppurating along the sidewalk like amoebas or ticks ....

A blind news dealer tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their fingers run together like fettucine over a stack of New York Posts . . . . It 's horrible ... it 's obscene ... it 's the end I was so dazed , I was no longer wondering what the assembled students thought of all this . But just at that moment one of them raised his hand . He was a tall boy with a lot of curly hair and a Fu Manchu moustache . " Yes ? " said the ecologist . " There 's one thing I ca n't understand , " said the boy . " What 's that ? " said the ecologist . " Well , " said the boy . " I 'm a senior , and for four years we 've been told by people like yourself and the other gentlemen that everything 's in terrible shape , and it 's all going to hell , and I 'm willing to take your word for it , because you 're all experts in your fields .

The panelists looked at this poor turkey to try to size him up . Was he trying to be funny ? Or was this the native bray of the heartland ? The ecologist struck a note of forbearance as he said : " I 'm sure that 's true , and that illustrates one of the biggest difficulties we have in making realistic assessments . A university like this , after all , is a middle-class institution , and middle-class life is calculated precisely to create a screen ? " " I understand all that , " said the boy . " What I want to know is ? how old are you , usually , when it all hits you ? " And suddenly the situation became clear . The kid was no wiseacre ! He was genuinely perplexed ! ...

Frisbee ! How can such things be ? S-s-s-s-s-s-s-ssssssss 0 NE SATURDAY NIGHT in 1965 I found myself on a stage at Princeton University with Giinter Grass , Allen Ginsberg , Paul Krassner , and an avant-garde filmmaker named Gregory Markopoulos . We were supposed to talk about " the style of the Sixties . " The auditorium had a big balcony and a lot of moldings . It reminded me of the National Opera House in San Jose , Costa Rica . The place was packed with about twelve hundred Princeton students and their dates . Before things got started , it was hard to figure out just what they expected . Somebody up in the balcony kept making a sound like a baby crying . Somebody in the main floor always responded with a strange sound he was able to make with his mouth and his cupped hands . It sounded like a raccoon trapped in a garbage can . The baby ... the raccoon in a can .... Every time they did it the whole place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dates " ... yes ... this was back before the era of " Our eyes met , our lips met , our bodies met , and then we were introduced . " Anyway , the format was that each man on the stage would make an opening statement about the 1960s , and then the panel discussion would begin . Gunter Grass , as Germany 's new giant of the novel , the new Thomas Mann , went first . He understood English but did n't feel confident speaking in English , and so he made his statement in German . I doubt that there were ten people in the place who knew what he was saying , but he seemed to speak with gravity and passion . When he finished , there was tremendous applause . Then an interpreter named Albert Harrison ( as I recall ) delivered Mr. Grass 's remarks in English . Sure enough , they were grave and passionate . They were about the responsibility of the artist in a time of struggle and crisis . The applause was even greater than before . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dates rose , too . The moderator was Paul Krassner , editor of i he Realist magazine . I remember looking over at Krassner . He looked like one of the trolls that lives under the bridge in Norse tales and sits there stroking its molting nose and waiting for hotshots to swagger over the span . Krassner had to wait for about two minutes for the applause to die down enough to make himself heard . Then he leaned into his microphone and said quite solemnly : " Thank you , Canter Grass . And thank you , Albert Harrison , for translating ... Mr. Grass 's bar mitzvah speech . " Stunned ? like 1.200 veal calves entering the abattoir . Then came the hissing . Twelve hundred Princeton students &; dates started hissing . I had never heard such a sound before ... an entire hall consumed in hisses ... " **27;3182;TOOLONG ! " You could n't hear yourself talk . You could only hear that sibilant storm . Krassner just sat there with his manic troll look on , waiting for it to die down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subside a bit , he leaned into the microphone again and said : " For two years I 've been hearing that God is dead . I 'm very much relieved to see he only sprung a leak . " For some reason that stopped the hissing . The kid up in the balcony made a sound like a baby crying . The kid on the main floor made a sound like a raccoon in a garbage can . The crowd laughed and booed , and people tried out new noises . The gyroscope was now gone from the control panel .... Our trajectory was end over end ... The next thing I knew the discussion was unto the subject of fascism in America . Everybody was talking about police repression and the anxiety and paranoia as good folks waited for the knock on the door and thedescent of the knout on the nape of the neck . I could n't make any sense out of it . I had just made a tour of the country to write a series called " The New Life Out There " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-World War II boom had by now pumped money into every level of the population on a scale unparalleled in any nation in history . Not only that , the folks were running wilder and freer than any people in history . For that matter , Krassner himself , in one of the strokes of exuberance for which he was well known , was soon to publish a slight hoax : an account of how Lyndon Johnson was so overjoyed about becoming President that he had a necrophiliac bout with John F. Kennedy on Air Force One as Kennedy 's body was being flown hack from Dallas . Krassner presented this as a suppressed chapter from William Manchester 's book , Death of a President . Johnson , of course , was still President when it came out . Yet the merciless gestapo dragnet missed Krassner , who cleverly hid out onstage at Princeton on Saturday nights . Suddenly I heard myself blurting out over my microphone : " My God , what are you talking about ? We 're in the middle of a ... Happiness Explosion ! " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the crying baby . The kid down below did the raccoon ... Krakatoa , East of lava ... I disappeared in a tidal wave of rude sounds ... Back to the goon squads , search-and-seize and roust-a-daddy ... Support came from a quarter I had n't counted on . It was Grass , speaking in English . " For the past hour I have my eyes fixed on the doors here , " he said . " You talk about fascism and police repression . In Germany when I was a student , they come through those doors long ago . Here they must be very slow . " Grass was enjoying himself for the first time all evening . He was not simply saying , " You really do n't have so much to worry about . " He was indulging his sense of the absurd . He was saying : " You American intellectuals ? you want so desperately to feel besieged and persecuted ! " He sounded like Jean-Francois Revel , a French socialist writer who talks about one of the great unexplained phenomena of modern astronomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always descending in the United States and yet lands only in Europe . Not very nice , Ginter ! Not very nice , Jean-Francois ! A bit supercilious , would n't you say ! In fact , during the 1960s American intellectuals seldom seemed to realize just how patronizing their European brethren were being , To the Europeans , American intellectuals were struggling so hard ( yet once again ) to be correct in ideology and in attitude ... and they were being correct ... impeccable , even ? which was precisely what prompted the sniggers and the knowing looks . European intellectuals looked upon American intellectuals much the way English colonial officials used to look upon the swarthy locals who came forward with their Calcutta Toff Oxford accents or their Lagos Mayfair tailored clothes . It was so touching ( then why are you laughing ? ) to see the natives try to do it right . I happened to have been in a room in Washington in 1961 when a member of Nigeria 's first Cabinet ( after Independence ) went into a long lament about the insidious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domesticate his people . " Just look at rne ! " he said , looking clown at his own torso and flipping his hands toward his chest . " Look at this suit ! A worsted suit on an African ? and a double-breasted waistcoat ! " He said " double-breasted waistcoat " with the most shriveling self-contempt you can imagine . " This is what they 've done to me , " he said softly . " I ca n't even do the High Life anymore . " The High Life , was a Low-Rent Nigerian dance . He continued to stare down at the offending waistcoat , wondering where he 'd left his soul , or his Soul , in any event . Perhaps someday , if Mr. Bob Silvers 's Confessions are published , we will read something similar . Silvers is co-editor of The New York Review of Books . His accent arrived mysteriously one day in a box from London . Intrigued , he slapped it into his mouth like a set of teeth . It seemed . . right . He began signing up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Books that wags began calling it The London Review of Bores and Don &; Grub Street . He seemed to take this good-naturedly . But perhaps someday we will learn that Mr. Bob Silvers , too , suffered blue moods of the soul and stood in front of a mirror wiggling his knees , trying to jiggle his roots , wondering if his feet could ever re-negotiate the Lindy or the Fish or the HokeyPokey . Hell 's angels HOW FAITHFULLY our native intelligentsia has tried to . . . do it right ! The model has not always been Eng-land . Not at all . Just as frequently it has been Germany or France or Italy or even ( on the religious fringe ) the Orient . In the old days ? seventy-five-or-so years ago ? the well-brought-up young intellectual was likely to be treated to a tour of Europe ... we find Jane Acldanis recuperating from her malaise in London and Dresden ... Lincoln Steffens going to college in Heidelberg and Munich . Mabel Dodge setting up house in Florence ... Randolph Bourne discovering Germany 's " charming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Jersey ? ? which now " seemed almost too grotesquely squalid and frowsy to be true . " The business of being an intellectual and the urge to set oneself apart from provincial life began to be indistinguishable , In July 1921 Harold Stearns completed his anthology called Civilization in the United States ? a contradiction in terms , he hastened to note ? and set sail for Europe . The " Lost Generation " adventure began . But what was the Lost Generation really ? It was a post-Great War discount tour in which middle-class Americans , too , not just Bournes and Steffenses , could learn how to become European intellectuals ; preferably French . The European intellectual ! What a marvelous figure ! A brilliant cynic , dazzling , in fact , set like one of those Gustave Miklos Art Deco sculptures of polished bronze and gold against the smoking rubble of Europe after the Great War . The American intellectual did the best he could . He could position himself against a backdrop of . . . well , not exactly rubble .. but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Puritanism , Philistinism , Booster-ism , Greed , and the great Hog Wallow . It was certainly a psychological wasteland . For the next fifty years , from that time to this , with ever-increasing skill , the American intellectual would perform this difficult feat , which might be described as the Adjectival Catch Up . The European intellectuals have a real wasteland ? Well , we have a psychological wasteland . They have real fascism ? Well , we have social fascism ( a favorite phrase of the 1930s , amended to " liberal fascism " in the 1960s ) . They have real poverty ? Well , we have relative poverty ( Michael Harrington 's great Adjectival Catch Up of 1963 ) . They have real genocide ? Well , we have cultural genocide ( i.e. , what universities were guilty of in the late 1960s if they did n't have open-admissions policies for minority groups ) . Well ? all right ! They were difficult , these one-and-a-half gainers in logic . But they were worth it . What had become important above all was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetness and light in the smoking tar pit of Hell . The intellectual had become not so much an occupational type as a status type . He was like the Medieval cleric , most of whose energies were devoted to separating himself from the mob ? which in modern times , in Revel 's phrase , goes under the name of the middle class . Did he want to analyze the world systematically ? Did he want to add to the store of human knowledge ? He not only did n't want to , he belittled the notion , quoting Rosa Luxemburg 's statement that the " pot-bellied academics " and their interminable monographs and lectures , their intellectual nerve gas , were sophisticated extensions of police repression . Did he even want to change the world ? Not particularly ; it was much more elegant to back exotic , impossible causes such as the Black Panthers ' . Moral indignation was the main thing ; that , and a certain pattern of consumption . In fact , by the 1960s it was no longer necessary to produce literature , scholarship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such matters , except as a consumer in order to qualify as an intellectual . It was only necessary to live la vie intellectuelle . A little brown bread in the bread box , a lapsed pledge card to CORE , a stereo and a record rack full of Coltrane and all the Beatles albums from Revolver on , white walls , a huge Dracaena marginata plant , which is there because all the furniture is so clean-lined and spare that without this piece of frondose tropical Victoriana the room looks empty , a stack of unread New York Review of Books rising up in a surly mound of subscription guilt , the conviction that America is materialistic , repressive , bloated , and deadened by its Silent Majority , which resides in the heartland , three grocery boxes full of pop bottles wedged in behind the refrigerator and destined ( one of these days ) for the Recycling Center , a small , uncomfortable European car ? that pretty well got the job done . B Y THE LATE 1 960s it seemed as if American intellectuals had at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campuses and in the slums . The war in Vietnam had developed into a fullsized Hell . War ! Revolution ! Imperialism ! Poverty ! I can still remember the ghastly delight with which literary people in New York embraced the Four Horsemen . The dark night was about to descend . All agreed on that but there were certain ugly , troublesome facts that the native intellectuals , unlike their European mentors , had a hard time ignoring . By 1967 Lyndon Johnson may have been the very generalissimo of American imperialism in Southeast Asia ? but back here in the Blaming the messenger w ITH THE HUNGARIAN UPRISING of 1956 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 it had become clear to Mannerist Marxists such as Sartre that the Soviet Union was now an embarrassment . The fault , however , as tout le monde knew , was not with socialism but with Stalinism . Stalin was a madman and had taken socialism on a wrong turn . ( Mistakes happen . ) Solzhenitsyn began speaking out as a dissident inside the Soviet Union in 1967 . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? they merely underscored just how wrong the Stalinist turn had been . The publication of The Gulag Archipelago in 1973 , however , was a wholly unexpected blow . No one was ready for the obscene horror and grotesque scale of what Solzhenitsyn called " Our Sewage Disposal System " ? in which tens of millions were shipped in boxcars to concentration camps all over the country , in which tens of millions died , in which entire races and national groups were liquidated , insofar as they had existed in the Soviet Union . Moreover , said Solzhenitsyn , the system had not begun with Stalin but with Lenin , who had immediately exterminated non-Bolshevik opponents of the old regime and especially the student factions . It was impossible any longer to distinguish the Communist liquidation apparatus from the Nazi . Yet Solzhenitsyn went still further . He said that not only Stalinism , not only Leninism , not only Communism but socialism itself led to the concentration camps ; and not only socialism , but Marxism ; and not only Marxism but any ideology that sought to reorganize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was impossible to say that Soviet socialism was not " real socialism . " On the contrary ? it was socialism done by experts ! Intellectuals in Europe and America were willing to forgive Solzhenitsyn a great deal . After all , lie had been born and raised in the Soviet Union as a Marxist , he had fought in combat for his country , he was a great novelist , he had been in the camps for eight years , he had suffered . But for his insistence that the isms themselves led to the death camps ? for this he was not likely to be forgiven soon . And in fact the campaign of antisepsis began soon after he was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 . ( " He suffered too much ? he 's crazy . " " He 's a Christian zealot with a Christ complex . " " He 's an agrarian reactionary . " " He 's an egotist and a publicity junkie . " ) Solzhenitsyn 's tour of the United States last year was like an enormous funeral procession titat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no part of him . The New York Times sought to bury his two major speeches , and only the moral pressure of a lone Times writer , Hilton Kramer , brought them any appreciable coverage at all . The major television networks declined to run the Solzhenitsyn interview that created such a stir in England earlier this year ( it ran on some of the educational channels ) . And the literary world in general ignored him completely . In the huge unseen coffin that Solzhenitsyn towed behind him were not only the souls of the zeks who died in the Archipelago . No , the heartless bastard had also chucked in one of the last great visions : the intellectual as the Stainless Steel Socialist glistening against the bone heap of capitalism in its final , brutal , fascist phase . There was a bone heap , all right , and it was grisly beyond belief , but socialism had created it .
