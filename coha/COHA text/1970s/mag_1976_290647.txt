The story is all too familiar . A shopper buys a refrigerator , handsaw or any of hundreds of thousands of other products covered by a warranty only to have the product quickly break down . When the consumer reads the warranty 's fine print , he discovers that the document is so filled with exceptions and qualifications as to make the manufacturer 's promise to fix or replace the item almost useless . That situation is likely to become far less common in the years ahead because of the first of a series of strict new warranty regulations issued recently by the Federal Trade Commission under the Warranty Act of 1975 . <P> What Is " Full " ? The act , a kind of anti-lemon aid sponsored by Democratic Senators Warren G. Magnuson of Washington and Frank E. Moss of Utah , took effect last July . It is aimed at clearing up misunderstandings about manufacturers ' guarantees . These misunderstandings arise from such common practices as exempting certain parts of the product from the warranty or requiring the buyer to pay for shipping a defective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act requires that any manufacturer offering a " full " warranty must agree to correct or replace a defective product free within a " reasonable " time whether or not the owner is the original buyer . Anything less than such unconditional assurance must be labeled a " limited " warranty . The FTC was authorized to fill in many details of the vaguely worded law with specific regulations . <P> Now , the FTC has issued one proposal and the first three regulations that manufacturers or retailers must abide by if they offer full warranties for products costing $15 or more . The proposal that is still subject to change is aimed at the used-car business . Among other things , the FTC would require dealers to affix a sticker on each car that they sell . The sticker would have to reveal the car 's prior use , private or commercial , and a description of any major work that the dealer had done on the car . <P> These regulations would require manufacturers to : <P> 1 ) Reveal warranty information to consumers before they buy the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples , printing them on packages or displaying them on a sign near the product . At present many consumers take the product home , open the box and find the warranty inside . <P> 2 ) Fully disclose warranty terms in " simple and readily understood language . " Among the facts that must be listed : precisely when , how and by whom a product will be repaired or replaced , and who will make a refund . Currently warranties are often clotted with legalese and offer implied instead of explicit promises . <P> 3 ) Establish a procedure to handle consumer complaints . Under this rule , which takes effect July 4 ( the first two become effective next Jan. 1 ) , a manufacturer may choose to allow adjudication of disputes before the consumer business arbitration tribunals that have been created by many Better Business Bureaus or set up its own panel . But a company panel must be composed mainly of nonindustry representatives .
