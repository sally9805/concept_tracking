txt On the basis of the latest estimate of the total cost to the city of buying and rehabilitating Yankee Stadium , the Budget Bureau yesterday put the price tag at $66.4-millionor $42.4-million more than the original estimate in 1971 by Mayor John V. Lindsay and almost $10-million more than has already been went . - John T. Carroll , director of the " city 's construction pro . gram , said the increased costs for the stadium project were caused by unforeseen engineer . ing difficulties and inflation . " The actual cost of construction of the stadium based on the prices at the time of bidding are in line with our general experience in massive rehabilitation projects , " Mr. Carroll said . Called a Bargain He also declared that the over - all investment in the stadium " is a bargain at this price " when you consider the effect it will have on rehabilitating the area and the impact on the city 's economy in expanding major sport activities . " The reconstruction of the Bronx stadium " is on target , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed by March in time- for the start of next year 's baseball season . Budget Director Melvin N. Lechner said that included in Mayor Beame 's fiscal plan for spending , which will be presented next week to the State Emergency Financial Control Board , will be an allocation of $1.5-million for this year for additional stadium costs . To date , Mr. Lechner said , the city has allocated $56.5-mil // lion to rebuild the stadium and upgrade the surrounding area . Next year the city will have to appropriate $1.5-million more to build a 1,000-car parking lot on the site now used by the state while it builds a ramp from the Major Deegan Expressway to the stadium area . The city has already allocat- ' ed $4.5-million toward the pur- , chase of the stadium property . The Budget Bureau estimated that final settlement of that as-I pect'might take up three years , and that $6.9-million more , would be needed in 1977 toward the final price plus interest . Luis Neco , special assistant , corporation counsel in charge ' of the stadium condemnation , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ' time and that the city might have to start proceedings in State Supreme Court to condemn the property . Figure Called Too High Mr. Neco said that no firm figure had been put forth during negotiations but that a $9.5-million figure for both the land and the stadium structure had been mentioned . He said that both he and the office of Controller Harrison J. Goldin deemed the figure " excessive and unacceptable . " The Knights of Columbus , which owns the land , had asked for $4.5-million . But , Mr. Neco said , Rice University , which owns the structure , and the Yankees , which made improvements , were squabbling over what they were entitled to . In March , 1971 , Mayor John V. Lindsay announced that the city would buy Yankee Stadium , principally to keep the Yankees- and the football Giants here . But the Giants contracted to play in the stadium now under construction in the New Jersey meadowlands . Mr. Lindsay 's plan was to lease the renovated 48-year-old stadium back to the Yankees on the same terms on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then how ' he intended to finance his estimated $24-million project ? $3-million for land acquisition and $21-million for rehabilitation ? Mr. Lindsay said be would not take the money ' from his hard-pressed executive budget . Instead , he said , it was his intention to finance . 25 per cent with : funds from ' the capital or construction ; budget and raise 75 per cent outside the mandated debt limit with the sale of revenue anticipation nnres to be redeemed from the proceeds from parking concessions . " It will be a strain on the budget , " Mr. Lindsay said , " but we are committed to it and - we need to do it . " Under local finance law , the city has a 75 per cent exclusion from debt limit borrowing for projects that will produce revenues . City Hall sources said that Mr. Lindsay had based his estimate of ** on the cost to the city to build Shea Stadium for precisely $24-million . " This was totally unrealistic , " an informant said . " In addition , you will remember we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the take-over of the stadium palatable not only to the Board of Estimate but also to the public ? ' Although Mr. Beame , who was then Controller , went along with Mr. Lindsay 's plan , principally because it would rehabilitate the area and produce revenues , he - estimated then that the cost - would be more like S50-million. ?
