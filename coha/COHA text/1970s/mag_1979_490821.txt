THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment FF VERY once in a while , a panicky feeling of helplessness seems to sweep through the American political establishment , and the President suddenly finds himself pressured on all sides to shore up everyone 's confidence in the country 's strength by making a display of " toughness " of one sort or another . Last week was such a time . Senator Howard Baker , apparently a Republican aspirant for the Presidency , reported " a growing view that America is a patsy and we never retaliate . " David Broder , of the Washington Post , counselled the President to take a word of advice from Machiavelli and adopt measures to avoid being " rendered despicable by being thought changeable , frivolous , effeminate , timid , and irresolute . " And he advised the President to " show the flag " somewhere . Time observed , " The basic trouble seems to be that Jimmy Carter , after two years in office , is still unable to project a sense that he is in control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The elements of a nation 's strength are its tools for influencing events ... and the and skill to use the tools . The Administration lacks the last two . " Mel Elfin , of New.sweek , harking back to the famous phrase used by President Nixon when he ordered the invasion of Cambodia , in 1970 , mused about whether the United States might not be becoming a " pitiful , helpless giant . " In the past , when critics urged tough behavior on Presidents , they had a pretty clear idea of where it should take place ( some obvious crisis  --  in Berlin , Korea , Cuba , or Vietnam , for example  --  was usually in progress ) , but this time the advice lacked any definite geographical orientation . With almost a single voice , elected officials and political commentators were recommending that the President do something to somebody , somewhere , but were n't saying what , or to whom . To be sure , the instances of alleged " softness " were almost always the same . First and foremost was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shah of Iran or somehow to retaliate against the new regime in response to the attack by leftist guerrillas on our embassy there . Second was our subdued response to the kidnapping and killing of Ambassador Adolph Dubs , our representative in Afghanistan , by unidentified terrorists . Third was President Carter 's failure to respond in kind to some harsh words addressed to him by Mexico 's President Lopez Portillo about American feelings toward his country . But specific measures that President Carter might have taken in any of these situations were rarely mentioned , Against whom should we " retaliate , " and with what means In what seas should we " show the flag " ? Could the United States actually have saved the Shah ? At what cost ? And if we had tried and failed , what would the cost of failure have been ? How would our access to Iran 's oil have been affected ? Did the failure of the Afghanistan government to save an American Ambassador from terrorists really signal a decline in American power ? H so , what action on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should President Car ter have visited verbal " retaliation " on President Ldpez Pnrtilln , and if he had done so how would that affect our access to Mexican oil ? And if we got tough with both Mexico and Iran , how would this affect our oil supply as a whole ? And how is this sort of toughness related to the toughness on ourselves that a serious program to conserve energy would call for ? These questions and others like them went largely unasked by the advocates of belligerence . The curious impression was left that for many of them toughness had become an abstraction . Force , once thought of as a means of last resort to he employed regretfully for the attainment of definite ends , seemed to emerge as an end in itself  --  a sort of platonic ideal that had floated free from the messy circumstances of the actual world . student . Feynman is now a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology and was a co-winner of the Nobel Prize for physics in 19651 I had gone to see Einstein with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory when seen in this new light .... He listened to me patiently for twenty minutes until I finished . At the end he repeated that familiar remark of his . still can not believe that the good Lord plays dice . ' And then he went on to add again in his beautifully slow , clear , well-modulated , and humorous way , ' Of course I may be wrong ; but perhaps I have earned the right to make my mistakes . ' " Professor Wheeler continues , " I had to be away from Princeton for national reasons from 194-2 to 1945 and again from 1950 to 1953 ; but on my return in the fall of 1953 I gave far the first time the course in general relativity Einstein 's great theory of gravitation , published in 19161 in which I was to learn so much from my students over the years . That fall , about a year and a half before he died , Einstein was kind enough to invite me to bring the eight to ten students in the course around to his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " school " of physics , or even many students , was always receptive to the ideas of young scientists . Soon after he met Niels Bohr , at a time when Bohr was not well known , Einstein wrote to him : " I am studying your great works and  --  when I get stuck anywhere  --  now have the pleasure of seeing your friendly young face before me smiling and explaining . " Professor Wheeler goes on , " Margot Einstein his stepdaughter and Helen Dukas his secretary from 1928 to his death , in 1955 served ... as we sat around the dining room table . The students asked questions about everything from the nature of electricity and unified field theory to the expanding universe and his position on quantum theory and Einstein responded at length and fascinatingly . Finally , one student outdid the others in the boldness of his question : ' Professor Einstein , what will become of this house when you are no longer living ? ' Einstein 's face took on that humorous smile and again he spoke in that beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately into printer 's type : ' This house will never become a place of pilgrimage where the pilgrims come to look at the hones of the saint . ' And so it is today . The tourist buses drive up . The pilgrims climb out to photograph the house  --  hut they do n't go in . " The real " place of pilgrimage " that Einstein left for us is his work . Einstein was the last and greatest of the classical physicists . But although his general theory of relativity replaced Newton 's theory of gravitation , and although he took the steps that made the modern quantum theory possible , his intuitions were deeply rooted in classical geometry . He had a very visual mind . He thought in terms of **25;6134;TOOLONG , or experiments carried out in the mind . This mode of thinking went back to his childhood . In his autobiographical notes , which were written at the age of sixty-seven and were published by the Library of Living Philosophers as an introduction to a collection of essays about him called " Albert Einstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obituary , " he wrote , " At the age of 12 , I experienced a second wonder the first being his encounter with a magnetic compass when he was five of a totally different nature : in a little hook dealing with Euclidean plane geometry , which came into my hands at the beginning of a school year . Here were assertions , as for example the intersections of the three altitudes of a triangle in one point , which though by no MARCH 5 , 1 9 7 9 means evident  --  could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any doubt appeared to be out of the question . This lucidity and certainty made an indescribable impression upon me . That the axiom had to be accepted unproved did not disturb me . In any case it was quite sufficient for me if I could peg proofs upon propositions the validity of which did not seem to me to he dubious .... Also , the objects with which geometry deals seemed to be of no different type than the objects of sensory perception , ' which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the world that Einstein theorized about seems vastly oversimplified . Modern physics deals with objects quarks , gluons , and the rest  --  that can not " be seen and touched . " After laying the foundation upon which these modern theories have been built , Einstein abandoned the enterprise . He could not make himself believe that the quantum theory , with its probabilities , its remoteness from the visual , was the final answer ? " the true Jacob . " His colleagues and successors went on without him . Many people find something tragic in this . He never did , and he went about his work serenely . Indeed , one might say that since he failed to do what he set out to do in terms of classical physics , it very likely can not he done . He was acutely and painfully aware of the fragility of the human species , and more especially so after the Second World War , when it became clear that we now had the technology for self-annihilation . This fragility has clouded our times with a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e -- his warm and generous nature , his absolute honesty , and his courage  --  shows us what we are capable of at our very best . ? ? Opera D  --  but WE 'D like to tell you about Mr. and Mrs. Dominick Frank , of Oil City , Pennsylvania , who have found out the hard way that opera is one of the world 's more unpredictable professions . Mr. Frank is a short , cheerful gray-haired optician . Mrs. Frank is a thin , attractive brown-haired housewife . They are both of Italian descent  --  his name was originally Franchella , and his father came from Torrebruna , in the Abruzzi ; her maiden name was Gammen ? , and her father came from Naples  --  and they are enormously proud of their only son , Joseph , who was scheduled to make his debut at the Metropolitan Opera on Tuesday , February 13th . The opera was Richard Strauss 's " Ariadne auf Naxos , " and Joseph Frank , who calls himself a character tenor ( rather than a comprimario ) had been assigned the minor but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Monday , February 12th , Mr. and Mrs. Frank drove through a blinding snowstorm to the Pittsburgh airport ( " We passed seven accidents on the way , " said Mr. Frank ) , where they joined forces with twelve other relatives and friends , who were all flying to New York for Joseph 's data . After a five-hour trip ( " My daughter Barbara and her husband , Terry Peterson , almost did n't get on the plane , " said Mrs. Frank , " because the airline decided to take on extra fuel and limit the passengers to twenty-four . Then they de-iced the wings and let everybody on " ) , the Franks arrived in New York , only to find that the rooms they had booked at the Mayflower Hotel were still occupied . " Joe screamed a lot at the desk people , and they finally gave us a suite , " said Mrs. Frank . Other relatives arrived the following day , and when everybody assembled at Mamma Leone 's for lunch the Franks passed out fourteen tickets for the evening 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after four o'clock , a friend called and asked Mrs. Frank if she 'd heard the news . " Heard what ? " said Mrs. Frank . " The opera 's been cancelled , because Leontyne Price is sick , " replied the friend . ( In point of fact , it was not only Miss Price  --  the Ariadne  --  who was down with a virus . Teresa Kubiak , the cover Ariadne , was also ill , and Leonie Rysanek , another soprano who could sing the part , had returned unexpectedly to Germany , pleading fatigue . As a result of these misfortunes , the evening 's opera was changed to " Don Carlos . " ) " I checked with Joe a few minutes later to confirm the cancellation , " said Mrs. Frank , " and from then on it was bedlam . The boys ran around town collecting the tickets , and Joe managed ? to turn them in at the box office . My niece , Marita , a nurse from Youngstown , Ohio , got hysterical , and her mother , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so upset that she went downstairs and sat in the lobby of her hotel and would n't talk to anybody for two hours . At 7 P.M. , we sent Barbara and my other daughter 's husband , Mark Hertwick , over to the Met to find a group of cousins who were driving down from New Rochelle . Well , we rounded up twenty-two people , and then we all came back to the 111ayflower and had a party . We served wine and a small buffet , and Joe opened eighteen telegrams , including one from Sister Antoinette , his music teacher at St. Joseph 's School and then at Venango Christian High School , in Oil City . Then he sang some Neapolitan folk songs a cappella , without even a pitch pipe . For the relatives who had never heard him , it was like having their own little opera . " Most of the relatives departed the following day , but Mr. and Mrs. Frank , Barbara and Terry , and Mrs. Frank 's sister Josephine Czekalski decided to stay on for the second performance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara and ? Terry went ice-skating and toured museums ; their elders walked around New York and saw " A Chorus Line . " On Saturday morning , several relatives flew back for Joseph 's delayed debut , which , to everyone 's relief , went on as scheduled . We dropped by Joseph Frank 's dressing room an hour before curtain time on Saturday evening and found him seated in front of a lighted mirror , being made up for his role as the Dancing Master . ( The opera , which takes place in an eighteenth-century mansion , concerns a wealthy patron 's sudden decision to combine an opera seria " Ariadne " ? with the antics of a group of commedia-dell'arte players . Mr. Frank , as the Dancing Master , is responsible for getting this rather odd show on the road . ) Mr. Frank is a short , slight man of thirty , who has large brown eyes , aquiline features , curly black hair , and a no-nonsense approach to his career . As Victor Callegari , the Met 's head makeup artist , painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his real eyebrows , Mr. Frank surveyed himself critically in the mirror and told us that he 'd been singing professionally for six years . " I made my professional debut in San Francisco , as the Dancing Master in Manon Lescaut , ' " he said , " and I 've made a speciality of character roles  --  short parts that require a singer who can move well and act convincingly . My voice is basically a lyric tenor , but I can color it according to the demands of a part , which makes me a useful commodity in the theatre . " We asked Mr. Frank to tell us about Strauss 's Dancing Master . " It 's the perfect debut role , " he replied , " because it demonstrates both the voice  --  I have to sing to a top B  --  and the ability to move onstage . The character is that of a practical man . When the decision is made to combine classical opera and light entertainment , it 's the Dancing Master who insists on making the musical cuts and who takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's the kind of person who would do well on Broadway . " With the makeup completed , Mr. CaBegan produced an elaborately curled wig and glued it around Mr. Frank 's hairline , Then , as the thirty-minute warning sounded on the intercom , Mr. Frank slipped into a magnificent lilac brocade coat trimmed with silver lace , picked up a slender ebony stick , and tried out a Baroque bow , " The first performance in any house is always unnerving , " he said , " and this one is particularly so , because Dale Duesing , a baritone who was supposed to make his Metropolitan debut tonight , as Harlequin , is sick , and I have n't rehearsed with his replacement . There 's a lot of stage movement in the Prologue , and we 've got to make sure we do n't run into each other . This is going to make for a nice spontaneous performance . " As things turned out , the opera proceeded smoothly and the audience was enthusiastic . Mr. Frank , who appeared only in the Prologue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a seasoned trouper and sang his brief arietta in a clear , sweet , medium-sized tenor voice . We went backstage to congratulate him at the end of the evening and found his dressing room crowded with assorted Franks and Gammellos , who were drinking champagne and showing each other their signed programs . " Did you see me lose my shoe right after my entrance ? " said Mr. Frank , kissing his mother as flashbulbs popped and cameras clicked . " I had a new pair of tights , which were thinner than the ones I 'd been wearing , and when I first came out and did a little jete I looked down and saw that one shoe had fallen off . So I turned around and found it . " Mrs. Frank , who looked slightly dazed , said she had n't really noticed . " It 's like a long , long dream , " she said . " I do n't think I 'll wake up until we get back to Oil City . " Dominick Frank , who was sipping champagne quietly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " Ariadne " quite a hit . " I do n't understand German , of course , " he said , " but since Joe has done this role in several productions , I 've studied the plot pretty carefully . You 've got to know what they 're saying up there onstage , and then , if you 're lucky , you suddenly got the feeling that all of those characters are real people . We used to listen to Mario Lanza a lot when Joe was growing up . But I think this career of his is going to expand our horizons quite a bit . " The Malibu Rock WE 'VE received a report from Malibu on the dislodging of that hundred-and-sixteen-ton rock from its perch above the Pacific Coast Highway : Last year , the star of the Malibu winter carnival was Burgess Meredith , whose teahouse fell into the ocean during the torrential rains . This year , it was Robert Radnitz , the film producer , whose beachfront house was directly across the highway from the rock 's perch , a hundred and eighty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneakers , warmup jacket , and neckerchief , Radnitz , whose movies include " My Side of the Mountain , " functioned as host and populist hero . He had sounded the first alarm early in February , after noticing a twenty-foot slippage in the rock 's position , then goaded an unwilling bureaucracy into action with a two-week campaign of phone calls , telegrams , and appeals to the media . He gave interviews in front of his house while walking his dog , Clem , who also wore a neckerchief . Two other neighborhood dogs wore neckerchiefs . The road was closed , for what turned out to be a two-day block party . On the morning of the first day , arriving guests were greeted by a young man on roller skates , in Renaissance hat and flowing robe . He said he was an actor , looking for an agent . " I 've been doing some Shakespeare , and I had the costume in the closet , so I thought , Why not skate on down here ? There 's no rock . It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " The highway was cluttered with bulldozers , emergency vehicles , MARCH 5 , 1979 and camera vans from almost every television station in town . Media helicopters played airborne chicken as they jockeyed for closeups of the rock . A catering truck arrived with skinny sandwiches and fifty-cents-a-cup coffee . An NBC technician marched up and down with a sign that said " SAVE THE ROCK . " Radnitz said he 'd spent the previous night in his house , even though the county had posted it as unsafe , largely at his behest . Reporters asked if he 'd had any anxiety dreams . He said he could n't recall any . Most of the talk centered on the best plan of attack . The hawks were led by Jim Decker , a local demolition man of high reputation who 'd blown the big rock over the nude beach at Pirate 's Cove a few years hack . Decker , whose family has been in the area since the eighteen-sixties , thought a pound of dynamite would take care of this rock , too , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The contract had gone to the Guy F. Atkinson Company , a large firm that leaned dovishIy toward a negotiated settlement with the rock . The Atkinson plan was for three bulldozers on top of the cliff to lower the rock gently to an earthen pad on the highway by means of cables and a huge steel net . In the first step , a helicopter would lay the net over the rock . But the helicopter was three hours late getting there , because someone had forgotten to file a landing plan with the Federal Aviation Administration . With nothing to report , reporters turned their attention to a young sculptor who offered to buy the rock for a hundred dollars and carve it into a bust of Governor Jerry Brown . The reporters loved this . The sculptor embellished on the theme . He would put the words " For President " across the base . He would auction the bust off . He would give a third of the proceeds to a Los Angeles cancer clinic . Someone asked him when he thought he might actually get his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " he said giddily , " hut the tension is building up by the minute . " Once the helicopter arrived , shortly before noon , it lifted the thirty-by-thirty-foot net into place without a hitch . Cheers from below , muffled by engine noise from above . The moment the bulldozers started tightening their cables , however , one strand of the net snapped apart with a resounding thwack . The helicopter thundered off to fetch a replacement strand from Wilmington , which is near Long Beach , thirty miles away . A pall of dust from the helicopter rotors settled on the festivities , followed by a pall of boreTHE NEW YOIIIIER dom . During the four hours it took for the helicopter to return , the only reportable event was the rescue by a sheriff's-department helicopter of a local newspaper photographer who 'd climbed down to the rock from the top of the cliff , and then could n't get hack up . It was rumored that the photographer was middle-aged , that he was overweight , that he was exhausted , that he 'd given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rescue helicopter scotched the last rumor : the photographer had given blood the day before . About five o'clock , the helicopter returned with the replacement strand , but it was too late to do anything with it . Darkness fell . The rock did not . Early the next morning , the sky was thicker than ever with media helicopters , and the sea was thick with spectators in kayaks , canoes , rowboats , outboards , and yachts . As the boat people stared up at the rock , a dozen or more whales cruised northward behind them , arcing high in the bright sun . Photographers ran toward the beach to get pictures of the whales . The boat people , thinking they were on television , waved and yelled . On a breakwater near Radnitz 's house , one of Jim Decker 's demolition men , Ken Joyce , caught a halibut . He threw it hack , partly because it was under twenty-two inches and partly because he felt that the eyes and ears of the world were on him . Joyce , whose business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounced the lack of progress . " The trouble is all those movie people up there have seen ton many movies . They think dynamite blows everything sky high . They do n't realize how controllable it is , " he said . Far from conceding the need for dynamite , the Atkinson men on the cliff were just beginning to put their plan into action . They had rewoven their net . Now they would jiggle the rock loose , then lower it to the ground . Bulldozer engines roared . Cables tightened . The net swayed . The rock held fast . For several hours , the bulldozers tugged at the net , twisting and turning it , but the rock still held fast . It was clearly a time for rethinking the problem . Late that morning , the Atkinson supervisor , a friendly man named Pete Boli , acknowledged that the jiggling had failed . He revealed a new tactic . The rock would he dislodged with a fire hose . Boll said he 'd got the idea from his father-in-law . Was his father-in-law a hydraulic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours , water squirted , pebbles fell , and mud oozed , but the rock stall held fast . Boli expressed amazement . Radnitz be ? trayed surprise . The producer , who 'd slept in his house once again , talked to reporters and said what he 'd said before  --  that any rock that had moved twenty feet was a rock that could fall at any moment . A young man in a hard hat urged Radnitz to read a novel he had written . " It 's called ' Fortune Favors the Brave , ' " the young man said . " It 's the underground classic of Aspen . " An afternoon paper came out with the blood donor 's photo of the rock on the front page : it was captioned " The Culprit . " A supervisor for Cal-trans , the California Department of Transportation , insisted that Radnitz was the culprit . " This whole thing is a waste , " he said . " Hundreds of thousands of dollars for a rock that could 've stayed up there a hundred years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party was giving out , a mild-mannered reporter stepped forward , took off his glasses , unbuttoned his suit and shirt , and revealed a Superman costume underneath . Camera crews surrounded the man , who was actually a disco disc jockey . They photographed him , recorded him , then rushed into their vans to see him on their monitors . He was a great success . Finally , Pete Boll acknowledged that the fire hose , like the jiggling , was a failure . The rock seemed incapable of falling down . The fire department turned the hose off . Radnitz defended his insistence that the danger was imminent . " It 's very easy to be a Monday-morning quarterback , " he said . " Any aftershock or heavy rain , I still feel , would bring that rock down . And I 'm concerned about human life . " " So you 'd rather be safe than sorry , " an interviewer said , " even though it ? was n't quite as precarious as you thought . " " I think it was as precarious as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when all the helicopters had flown home for the night and most of the bystanders had gone off to watch themselves on TV , Pete Boll and his crew decided to give it one last try . No more jiggling . No more hosing . This time , they would yank the thing down from below . Cables were fed through pulleys on the ground , then attached to a huge wheel loader some four hundred feet down the highway . By now , it was dark . The wheel loader 's engine strained . The pulleys groaned . Little pieces of sandstone tumbled down , then bigger and bigger ones . Suddenly , the whole rock all hundred and sixteen tons of it  --  began to slide . For a few seconds , the steel net slowed its fall . Then the rock tore the net to shreds , caromed down the cliff , crashed to the highway with the sound of an exploding mortar shell , and came to rest about twenty-five feet from Radnitz 's front door . " I 'm glad to see it down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-guessers who saw it come down realize what it could have done to a busload of schoolchildren . " Later that evening , Jim Decker and his demolition men finally got their turn . They used exactly one pound of dynamite , with surgical precision . The rock broke into four pieces . One of the largest pieces was sold on the spot to the young sculptor for a hundred dollars . Workers trucked it to the side of the road and wrapped it in a white tarpaulin . Somewhere deep inside was a bust of Jerry Brown .
