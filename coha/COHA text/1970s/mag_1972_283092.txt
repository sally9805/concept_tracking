Amid glove-tight corporate security and waves of speculation , the nation 's two photography giants have been racing for months to bring out new products that will make big money out of small size . Last April Polaroid Founder Edwin Land pulled a camera the size of a cigar case from his shirt pocket for his stockholders to get a glimpse of-but no more . There are rumors that the audience at next month 's annual meeting will get a much longer look , perhaps at the finished product . Last week Eastman Kodak Co. introduced a series of five ingenious little cameras , each about as big as a wallet and only one inch thick ; they also easily fit into a man 's shirt pocket . <P> The new Pocket Instamatics are successors to the fuller-sized cameras of the same name , which have sold more than 50 million units since they were brought out by Kodak in 1963 . Although purchases of regular Instamatics will undoubtedly trickle off as a result of the smaller model 's convenience , Kodak officials are convinced that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all cameras in use in the U.S. , they contend , are older and less sophisticated than the original Instamatic . During the new camera 's first year on the market , Kodak reportedly hopes to sell 4,000,000 of them at prices ranging from $28 to $128 ( v. $10 to $145 for regular Instamatics ) . Says Van Phillips , a Kodak vice president : " People are going to find that you can carry this camera around as easily as a pack of cigarettes . " <P> The trickiest problem in developing the new camera was finding a narrow-width film that would produce color prints of sufficient sharpness-a challenge that Germany 's Minox and other manufacturers of minicameras have never quite met . Kodak scientists came up with fine-grained film that converts negatives only about a third as large ( 17 mm. by 13 mm. ) as those recorded on regular Instamatic film to 3 in. - by- 4- in. standard prints-some 30% larger than the old ones . Photographers will pay the same as before for both film and printing . Says Kodak President Gerald B. Zornow : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right film . " <P> It may be a handy key to increased profits as well . Because of the reduced film size , Kodak will save on the cost of film base , plastic and other materials . In addition , the nation 's 650 print processors must buy new equipment to develop the smaller film ; naturally , the only company that sells it is Kodak . For photographers who want to shoot transparencies , Kodak is manufacturing a new series of slide projectors sized to show the 16-mm. film . <P> To Kodak officers , the sound of clicking shutters comes through as the music of prosperity-and for the past several years the music has not been quite as sweet as it might have been . Not that the company is in trouble ; last year it posted after-tax profits of $419 million on sales of nearly $3 billion . Still , partly because the market for highly profitable Instamatics was becoming glutted , earning levels have lagged slightly behind sales increases . But in recent months , largely in anticipation of a flashgun reception for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock from 72 to an alltime high of 113 . Last week it closed at 113.
