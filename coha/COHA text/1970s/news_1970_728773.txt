txt Not since the days of former President Eisenhower has anybody in high office come down so strongly for a balanced budget , an end to deficit financing , the " puritan ethic , " and individual enterprise as Caspar Weinberger , the top budget man in the new ' Nixon management shakeup . At one end of the capital this past week some eminent economists were advocating a sizable deficit to meet America 's business slump , while at the other Mr. Weinberger , a lawyer and the first noneconomic man to head budget affairs , was talking in non-Keynesian terms that are dramatically heretical in modern parlance . Mr. Weinberger is an intense , quiet-spoken , quizzical figure , a protege of Gov . Ronald Reagan 's conservative Republican regime in California . He was elected . three times to the State Assembly and , in 1955 , picked as the most able member of the Legislature by a newspaper poll . Unorthodox views noted He acquired a Harvard magna cum laude degree back in 1938 and a law degree there in 1941 . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was tapped in 1969 to head Mr. Nixon 's Federal Trade Commission . Now he has moved up another peg . But the most significant of his manifestations are his quiet , confident , and now unorthodox views on budgetary economics in the post-Keynesian age . Reporters ' jaws dropped , here , as he quietly made them known . The essence of the Keynes teaching is that governments should use their budgets to stabilize the economy by running a surplus ( through taxes or expenditure cuts ) to cut down a boom , and to run a deficit in hard times to get the economy running again . It was President Kennedy with the assistance of Walter W. Heller , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , who first instituted a tax cut at a time of a slump , and enlarged a planned deficit to stimulate a recovery . President Eisenhower had rejected such a course and had three recessions in eight years . Mr. Kennedy was generally hailed for his innovation , and many economists felt that the system of Keynes economics had been proved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficits . He feels federal intervention in the economy should be kept to a minimum and that so-called pump priming should be eschewed . " I do n't think deficits help anybody , " he said to a group here . " The federal budget should be managed like any other budget . We should live within our income and let other forces manage our economy . " Just this past week Harvard economist Otto Eckstein , former member of the Council of Economic Advisers , told the Senate that a deficit is indicated for the national budget . " Under the forecast of 1971 economic conditions , a balanced employment budget i.e. , a budget that produced full employment would imply an actual deficit of close to $10 billion , " Mr. Eckstein said . // *It 's budget heresy ! // Mr. Weinberger , however , argues that the budget ought to be kept balanced . Asked whether he would balance it every year , he said that might be too severe , but mentioned a five-year term . Without mentioning Messrs . Kennedy or Heller , Mr. Weinberger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to influence the economy . It might work for a year or two . but in the long run you really pay the piper . You can do it for a while and hope to get out of office before you have to take a wheelbarrow full of money to the grocery store . " If surplus develops . . . Mr. Weinberger does not favor increasing taxes to balance the budget . If and when a fiscal surplus develops he believes it should be spread out in tax cuts . Here again this is heretical to followers of the Kenneth Galbraith school , who argue that a cut in graduated income taxes aids the middle and upper incomes and not the poor , and that a budget surplus , when achieved , should go to expand social-service expenditures in the public sector . Mr. Weinberger was asked if he agreed with Governor Reagan 's disapproval of the Nixon family-assistance program . This would provide the equivalent of guaranteed incomes to the poor . It now is pending in the Senate after House passage . Mr. Weinberger did not answer directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by recent revisions . Mr. Heller , in Washington to testify at a Senate hearing , expressed astonishment when told of Mr. Weinberger 's views . Mr. Heller now is a professor at the University of Minnesota . In his testimony he declared that the cost of the present business slowdown is opening a gap between potential national output and actual output of $40 billion a year . " That loss could rise to a billion dollars a week , a year from now , " he said , " if the present slump continues . "
