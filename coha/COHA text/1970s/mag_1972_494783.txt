The Nixon Watch These Four Years In a note sent to several White House assistants on December 12 , I said I was preparing a review of Mr. Nixon 's first four years in the presidency and con ? tinued ; " I wonder if you 'd be willing to think back over your time at the White House and recall for my use two or three highlights of the experience whether involving the President , yourself alone or with others , anything serious or trivial that you especially remem ? ber . " The same request was made in person to other assistants . Because Henry Kissinger was in Paris at the time , and also because Kissinger 's assistants on the National Security Council staff understand that he alone is permitted to associate and communicate in any meaningful way with reporters , the inquiry was confined to people on the President 's domestic staff . Not at all to my surprise , the request was ignored by John D. Ehrlichman , the assistant for domestic affairs ; H. R. Haldeman , the administrative chief ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ters and the President 's relations with business moguls . Special Counsel Charles Colson responded after a fashion , in a way that I thought irrelevant to my re ? quest but nonetheless understandable , considering my tendency to refer to him as the President 's dirty-tricks man and to neglect his numerous other services , which Mr. Nixon has had a spokesman say he greatly values . Colson had his secretary say by telephone , with what sounded like a couple of apologetic giggles : " He said , since you 're thoroughly convinced that he 's an s.o.b. , it would take an undue amount of time to try to convince you otherwise and it probably would n't accomplish anything . " Maybe and maybe not . But the response left me wondering , as I 've been wondering these four years , at the obtuseness of some of the smartest people in the President 's employ . They are too dumb , or perhaps too locked in the paranoia that grips the Nixon White House , to grasp the fact that reporters as a species , this reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the mo ? tions of confiding in them now and then and provid ? ing a version , however weighted it may be , of what goes on . Three points have to be made before getting to some of the slightly more productive responses that 1 did receive . The first point is that the quoted assistants were talking about a President who would soon be resuming the unrestricted bombing of North Vietnam in order to obtain a settlement of the war that he ( in Henry Kissinger 's words ) " considers just and fair " and that ( in his own words ) he can accept " without staining the honor of the United States . " The second point is that the responses typify the reluctance of Mr. Nixon 's assistants to say or tell anything about him that comes anywhere near disclosing , in any but the blandest generalities and the most innocuous anecdotes , the private man behind the public facade . The third point is that the assistants had been asked to recall highlights of their parts in a term that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at home . The Nixon version of the record is set forth in a White House paper that runs to 43 single-spaced folio pages and 20,000 words . It is un ? derstated and factual on the whole , larded with less exaggeration and evasion of unpleasant qualifying circumstances than is to be expected in such a docu DECEMBER 23 &; 30 , 1972 ment . It is true , for instance , that the turmoils that racked the country when Mr. Nixon took office have been quieted ( though one may doubt that the quietude really signifies the healing that the President promised in his 1969 inaugural address ) . The economy has been stabilized and set on an upward trend and Mr. Nixon 's wage-price controls , which he proposes to extend , have done more violence to his own past principles of unfettered enterprise than they have to national and individual well-being . Critics who marvel at the omission of any reference to the cumulative budget deficit of around $100 billion during the first Nixon years must acknowledge that Mr. Nixon never prom ? ised in 1968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficits have had the sought effect of controlled stimulus . In view of Mr. Nixon 's recent expressions of scorn for the idea that the nation 's inward ills can be cured by " throwing dollars at the problems , " the scores of boasts that this President is spending more money on education , minority needs , protection of the environ ? ment , housing , health , urban recovery , rural develop ? ment , the arts and humanities and what-have-you than any President before him has spent invite sar ? donic notice . But the claim of effort and of some suc ? cess in many domestic problem areas is justified . So , it at least may be hoped , is the claim in the discussion of foreign policy that the Cold War has been " dimin ? ished if not ended by the President 's successful Summit trips " to Peking and Moscow and the agree ? ments that resulted . This can not be said of the confident references to a ' ' prospective agreement " to end the Vietnam war and a statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement " has been " virtually completed . " In this season of frustration and expanded American attack , they serve only to document the case that Mr. Nixon and his negotiator and counsellor , Henry Kissinger , did n't know where they stood and what they were doing in this matter when the White House record of " change that works " was put together in early December . Now for the promised responses and their sparse indications of what some of the President 's assistants remember from the four years and , in some instances , from association with Mr. Nixon before he won the presidency . Henry Cashen , 33 , is a lawyer and a deputy assistant to the President . Cashen works with Charles Colson and has been involved with him in creating a re ? markably complete system of contact with trade as ? sociations , ethnic groups , organized labor , the Catholic hierarchy and many other sources of prospec ? tive and actual support for the President and his policies . Of course without describing the process in intimate detail , Cashen remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1972 reelection effort about six months before election day and 17 directed it while seeming to remain in a state of lofty detachment . The President 's appeal to usually Demo ? cratic Catholic voters with his public stand against abortion , his promises of aid to parochial schools , and his courtesies to church dignitaries is recalled with special admiration . " The way he cracked that Catholic vote , " Cashen says , " is unbelievable . " Cashen , then three years out of law school , traveled with Nixon as a volunteer advance man during the 1966 congres ? sional campaign . He remembers how the sometime Vice President , then widely marked off as a loser and not sure he was n't , took heart from the crowds he drew at airport rallies and a year later , in 1967 , showed with rising ebullience and vigor his feeling that " he was really back in the ball game . " He remembers being with Colson , John Ehrlichman , George Shultz ( now treasury secretary ) and former Postmaster Gen ? eral Winton Blount when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to deal with a strike of postal workers was to send the army into the New York City post office , and hearing the Presi ? dent say with wry amusement that he 'd come to that conclusion without their help . There are " the little things " that Cashen and other assistants recount with suffocating regularity and genuine conviction , such as the President 's courtesies to wives and visiting parents and his flair for pleasing them with the recol ? lection of small details about them . It 's one of the qualities that causes Cashen to say , " He 's a very warm person and a very tough guy " and " There 's nothing I would n't do for Richard Nixon . " Raymond K. Price , Jr. , a reformed journalist who heads the White House writing staff , remembers a long memorandum that the President dictated after he visited a group of young antiwar protesters at the Lincoln Memorial in the dawn hours of a morning in May 1970 , after he 'd ordered the invasion of Cambodia . The memorandum recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he read and heard news accounts of the episode . The youngsters had said , and the media had reported with relish , that all he could talk about was football and surfing and such . The President thought he 'd been misunderstood and misinterpreted : he said in his memo that he was just trying to reach his hearers with the sports talk and then to get across to them some sense of his anguish and of his belief , however unlikely it might seem to them , that history would prove him to have been right . Ray Price also remembers his bitterness ? his word ? over what he calls " the despicable way McGovern handled the war issue at the end . " His reference is to Senator McGovern 's doubts , now proven to have been correct , that the draft Vietnam agreement disclosed by Hanoi and confirmed by Henry Kissinger in late October was a durable agree ? ment that would bring the promised peace . " He had been briefed , he had seen the agreement , and he knew it was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the impression , widespread at the White House , that an authentic text of the October draft had been passed to McGovern through former Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Warnke , who was getting White House briefings for the senator 's benefit . Warnke says that he was briefed in some de ? tail on October 28 but was neither shown nor given a text and thus never had one to give McGovern . Its a minor point , academic now , but indicative of the feeling in the President 's vicinity that his opponent and not Richard Nixon was the tricky and devious candidate in 1972 . Edward L. Morgan , a deputy assistant to the Presi ? dent and deputy director of the Domestic Council under John Ehrlichman , never once mentioned a personal contact with the President during 40 minutes of shared remembrance . The closest he came to it was his recollection of being taken along on a visit to a navy carrier and of occasional invitations to state dinners . " I do n't want to make it sound corny , " Morgan says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it is , the President cares enough to take the little guys along . " One of Morgan 's many domestic tasks was to work on the original version , now in limbo , of the President 's welfare reform pro ? gram . He remembers the thrill he got when he and Richard Nathan , an expert on the subject and a former assistant , were with Governor Nelson Rocke ? feller in New York City and received a telephone call from John Ehrlichman in Bucharest . Ehrlichman , there with the President at the end of a round-the-i world journey in 1969 , said Mr. Nixon needed to know what Rockefeller thought of the welfare draft before approving it . Morgan told Ehrlichman that the governor thought well of it and the episode looms high in his memory of " the first really big one I was on , " Morgan is to be an assistant secretary of the treasury and he looks forward with obvious pleasure to being " part of the President 's team in the departments . " Lee Huebner , a writer on Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a speech to the President last April , in the living room of his lodge at Camp David in the Maryland mountains near Washington . It was night time and the President was sitting alone in the dark , lights off , thinking . Huebner got back his draft the next morning with a scrawl across the top of the first page : " Lee ? okay ? good job ? RN 4:30 a.m . " He surmised later that the President must have been pondering the recent North Vietnamese attack on northern South Vietnam and his decision , then in the making and soon to he announced , to intensify the bombardment of North Vietnam and mine its harbors . Mr. Nixon said on May 8 that he had to do it in order to end the war . Near the close of the first four years , he is doing it again in order to end the war . John Osborne The Misuse of Grand Juries As if to underscore the prosecutor 's point that scholars who refuse to answer questions when subpoenaed are entitled to no different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handcuffed Professor Samuel Popkin of Harvard when , in the presence of news photographers , they carted him off to jail shortly before Thanksgiving under a judge 's order that he stay there until he would answer three questions to a fed ? eral grand jury . Precisely one week later , a beaming but unyielding Dr. Popkin posed for the photogra ? phers on his release from prison ? a " surprise " devel ? opment credited to the prosecutor 's somewhat belated conclusion that the grand jury did not need Popkin 's testimony after all . The grand jury which had been investigating the unauthorized distribution of the Pentagon Papers ? would not be meeting again , it turned out , before the date on which its term is to expire . Dr. Popkin 's tribulations were contemporaneous with publicized jailings of newsmen in California and New Jersey who had refused , on " reporter 's privilege " grounds , to disclose information sought by local courts . So the issue most mooted in press coverage of Pop-kin 's case was whether a scholar is entitled to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porter enjoys . That seems a curious subject for discus ? sion in light of the Supreme Court 's ruling in the Branzburg , Caldwell and Pappas cases , decided in late June , that there is no source-protecting reporter 's privilege . And what makes that debate even more cu ? rious is that protection of sources is not really what Popkin 's claim was about . The three questions for which he went to jail did not ask him to divulge the names of anyone in government service who had given him information . The federal court of appeals in Boston ? which had ruled on Popkin 's claim before the Supreme Court decisions in Branzburg , Caldwell and Pappas ? had been far more sympathetic to the public interest in protection of sources than a majority of the Supreme Court turned out to be . It had distinctly or ? dered that Dr. Popkin could he compelled to give names only " to the extent that the persons were not government officials or other participant-sources . " In other words , Dr. Popkin went to jail rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed the Pentagon Papers and from whom he may have learned the names of participants in the study . lie also chose jail rather than answer the direct question of whether he had discussed the Pentagon Papers with Daniel Ellsberg during the six months before their publication . These questions were appar ? ently important enough to the Department of Justice that it pressed for answers even to the point of jailing
