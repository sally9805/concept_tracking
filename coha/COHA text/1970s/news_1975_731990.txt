txt UNIVERSAL Training Service , a Miami-based correspondence school , is traveling the streets of Chicago in the head of 77-year-old Louis Carpenter , . as he cruises around in a late-model Cadillac making house calls . Universal , boasting 50,000 home-study students , advertises " Eight Exciting Careers " in the Yellow Pages , and operates openly in Illinois , tho it is illegal . The school , whose Orland Park phone number turns out to be an answering service , Is unlicensed in Illinois but operates without apparent restriction , making job promises it can not fulfill , preying on young people 's dreams of a better tomorrow thru education . THE GRANDFATHERLY Carpenter . with his'promises of a glorious future ? for $30 down and X easy lessons ? was encountered repeatedly by Tribune Task Force reporters during a three-month Investigation of the $3-billion-a year correspondence and trade school industry . One reporter met him when he called at her home to pitch her on a $995 course for an airlines ground hostess job , saying : " We train for 40 or 45 airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . " AnOther met him when he called at the reporter 's apartment to tell him about Universal 's heavy equipment school . " You can put $30 down today and that will help you to get signed up right now , " he said . " There are 30,000 construction jobs opening in Illinois this spring . " AND TO ANOTHER reporter , Car-pouter pitched an insurance adjusters ' course , which he hinted would earn its taker $50,000 a year . " We place .96 per cent of our graduates , " lie said . A check with major airlines revealed that all have their own training programs , and anyone hired from a cormspondence school would have to take the airline program regardless . Construction union officials said a heavy equipment operator can not get a job with only correspondence school training . Operating Engineers ' - business manager Wilfred Dewalt of Local 649 , Peoria , said : " WE ip.vr. our own training program , and it 's state approved ? and free ! We put in a nickel ap hohr for the training , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't do a thing but take a man 's money and make him promises they ca n't keep . " Last year , before its license was dropped , Universal submitted a 1974 placement list of students to the state . Of 13 checked at random , only one said lie obtained a job thru the school . Several others were not employed where the school saki ... they were , and others said they attended the school five years ago . The Minnesota Department of Education has refused to license ' Universal because of noncompliance with Minnesota laws . Universal is no longer licensed to operate in Illinois because of failure to place the required surety bonds for itself and any agents operating in the state . CARPENTER BOASTED to reporters that he had 05 salesmen working for him in this area . However , a check uncovered only one Universal salesman in addition to Carpenter . Thomas Richardson , assistant to the director of postsecondary education in Illinois , said : " As far as I am concerned , Universal is no longer licensed to do business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are in direct violation of state law . No school can operate without that surety bond on the school and on its agents . " MAYBE YOU have some knowledge that they arc hi operation . But how would I know that ? We have to assume in these cases that the schools are complying with state law . " Charles Craig , head of Universal operations in Miami , said , " I think that 's outside the purview of the media to investigate the operations of private business like that . We have people that are always complainers . They complain about everything , and you ca n't please them . " Abuses in the correspondence and trade school industry were first brought to The Tribune 's attention by Gov . Walker 's consumer advocate 's office , after It conducted a preliminary investigation . Universal was one of the extreme cases uncovered in the Task Force 's subsequent investigation of 13 Chicago area schools . BUT EVEN with the most reliable schools , students are taking a risk in signing up for mail-order courses . Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a down payment , regardless of educational background , talent , or ability to learn . For example , of three students who took the identical mail - order auto mechanics course from Advance Schools , Inc. , 1840 W. 79th St. , one said the course was ' ' just tremendous , " another described it as " too simple , " and a third said he could not understand it . Charles Chase , assistant to the president of Advance , a school that filed for reorganization under the federal Bankruptcy Act in May , said : " WE GET complaints . You have to get complaints . You have to get complaints from some people . We sell one course in each subject , and it has been carefully prepared and geared to help most people . But there are always some who will not be able to understand it , or who will know too much to get anything out of it . " Thomas Pekras , assistant director of post-secondary education in Illinois , said there are 250 such privately owned schools based in the state ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the department has only five people to monitor them . " Quite frankly , in evaluating courses , we many times know very little about the course itself , " he said . " We 've learned a lot as time goes by . " THE UTTER frustration of trying to learn a career by mail was described by Lee Smith , 50 , an unemployed construction foreman from Alderson , W. Va. , who took Bell &; Howell 's $1,400 course on TV repairing : " Volume two of the course arrived nine days ahead of volume one . For the next several months , the lessons continued to arrive out of sequence , and parts and equipment for one lesson often came with the test for another . " When I signed up they told me there was a toll-free number in Chicago I could dial if I ever had any trouble . Sometimes I would call the school every 20 minutes , all day long , trying to get thru to them . The line was always busy . " After six months , Smith ran up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fouled up there was nothing I could do . " HE DEMANDED his money back , and after a flurry of letters to the Better Business Bureau and various consumer affairs organizations , the school agreed to settle with him for $400 . A recent study by the Veterans Administration determined that 69.8 per cent of all veterans who take radio and TV repair courses by mail do not complete them . The dropout rate runs as high as 93 per cent for other courses . A typical dropout is Dennis Loren , 25 , of Amity Harbor , N. Y. , a Viet Nam veteran who enrolled in Bell &; Howell 's TV repair course , but found himself not educationally equipped to handle it . " BY THE fifth lesson It just became too advanced , " he said . " It was all formulas . It was the math I could n't understand . I was just happy to call it quits . " William Carson , executive vice president of Bell &; Howell 's home study division , said Smith studied three times faster than normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there were a couple of problems , " including mailing and other technical difficulties . He said Loren did not complain about his difficulty with math until after the school sent him a bill . Another drawback in taking home study courses is that the same course is mailed to every student who signs up for it , even tho the material may not apply to his part of the country . COMMERCIAL Trade Institute , 1400 W. Greenleaf Av. , a division of M-W Education Corp. , a Montgomery Ward subsidiary , offers a 100-lesson course in building construction for $695 . Patrick Maddalino , 24 , of Miami , Fla. , signed up for the course , with the VA picking up $625.50 of the cost . " The salesman told me that , when I graduated , that was all I needed to start working and get a job as a contractor , " he said . " He did n't tell me anything about testing and licensing by the county . In fact , Dade County Fla. does n't even accept this as an accredited school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or central states , and nothing like we have in Florida . They tell you how to build a building with a. certain kind of block we do n't use here . That means the architecture is different , and the stress will be different . " ROBERT Nottenburg , C. T. I. education director , said , " We offer a nationwide program . This man in Miami believes the zoning information is old because the laws there have been changed , but what we teach is typical of most other areas . " C. T. I. also offers a $995 motorcycle repair course that its salesmen say will teach a student how to become a motorcycle repairman . Minnesota says the course does n't fill the bill . Illinois ca n't seem to make up its mind . The state of Minnesota refused to accept the course after three experts determined it was worthless . A Chicago offlclot of the Illinois Department of Education told The Tribune : " Actually , the engine the stu dent got in the course should not have been approved , but next thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been approved . " THE ABSOLUTE futility of some home study courses often does n't hit home until after the mailman comes and a student discovers he is paying good money for lessons he could get free elsewhere or for common-sense Information he already knew . For example , American Truck Driving Schools , 7750 S. Cicero Av. , offers 60 home study lessons for $1,6110 on how to become a truck driver , which students must complete before they can qualify for the $300 course in actual driving . Six of the lessons , at $28 each , are mere reprints of a free publication of the United States Department of Transportation . ANOTHER TWO lessons , also at $28 each , consist of a few sentences informing the student he should take the Department of Transportation 's written test , which is required of all drivers . And a not her lesson , five pages on " Importance of Driver Training to the Industry , " lists only statements of praise for the school but costs $28 just the same . H. Donald Overbey , director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well designed , and there is no way you are going to make me apologize for them . These home study tests are pretty effective . We found that people who finish home study do well in resident training . They have a good ? chance of finishing resTwo of his students take a somewhat different view of the school . Charles Vesely , 22 , of Burba nk , called the 60-lesson home study course " a joke . All Mickey Mouse . " WHEN WE got to the actual driving course , I 'll bet you I spent no more than 15 minutes a day behind the wheel of a truck . The rest of the time I would sit and watch while others took their turns . " I could n't even come to class because there was nothing to do but stand around . The owners did n't care , because they were getting their money from the VA . They would even fudge my attendance records , just so they could get their hands on the VA money . " Richard Schulz , 32 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said : " Before I signed up , I said to the salesman , ' How is it with jobs ? ' He said there were more jobs than students . I thought : ' Oh , great ! This will be tremendous . ' Richard Schultz , a graduate of American Truck Driving School . He could n't get a job with his diploma . " I signed up , and they told me I would have a job for sure . I was so happy about it . I went home and told my family I would be driving a truck and making lots of money . . " All the while we were going to school the salesmen would give us this big pep talk about how there were these jobs out there . Overbey would tell us there were n't enough students to fill all the jobs . In my opinion the school was a ripoff ! " The school could n't place me . Finally I went out on my own . I hit every trucking company south of the Eisenhower . Each time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had graduated from the school . They wanted men with at least two years ' experience . " Luckily I 'm a veteran and did n't have to pay for the course out of my own pocket . " A f or m e r instructor for American , John Davis , who quit after one month , told The Tribune : " I 've worked all my life and just could n't stand the thought of taking another man 's money and giving him nothing but dreams . That 's the only thing these schools do . They hold out a slice of pie in the sky  --  and it just ai n't there . "
