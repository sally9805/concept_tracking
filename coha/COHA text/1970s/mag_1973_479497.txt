THEY HAVE MANY NAMES for those of us who were the children of that war . They say we are " conformist as Army worms , " " the safe generation , " " the silent generation . " With the survivors ' strength of approaching middle age , we can look back over separated decades of death knowing that , once upon a time , the pejoratives applied to us were true . They had killed us with their wars of liberty : childhood lost , maturity murdered in utero . If , in the Forties , we were threatened by the holocaust on other continents , in the Sixties it was our protective land over which the flames were spread . Seeking safety , we made ourselves invisible in the darkness of our inner caves while outside the ominous fires roared . By the end of the Sixties I no longer heard the howling wind . I no longer heard anything . Through the long decade I had listened as successive reels of film unwound themselves through my viewing machine . Protest dulled . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many murders , too many deaths . And thus I wrapped film and track around myself like a celluloid winding sheet . Charred by the end of the decade , I watched and listened . But I did not see and hear . What I did bored the life out of me . Film research is a painstaking , tedious job : plowing through thousands of feet of uncut , unused news-film , searching for an event , a phrase , a segment from someone else 's tale . The producer will snip ? these out and insert them , like jagged pieces , into the jigsaw scenes of the documentary film . Everyone has somethinc , to say , and he says it . Endlessly . My hands work the manual rewinds automatically . I no longer have to listen to every word . All their whining sounds the same . Turn the reels a little faster : the voice of Donald Duck . But , by the end of the decade , there were some consolations to my job . We were devoted to high purpose : filmmakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most affecting tool of our technology . It is McLuhan 's age , and television 's children have learned to learn by seeing , young minds awash in imagery . Thus we plundered the massive archives of the Sherman Grinberg Film Libraries in New York , whose vaults contain much of the filmed history of twentieth-century man . The old Paramount newsreels were stored there , explosive nitrate stock fast disintegrating , history turning to dust . Stored there , too , was the current product of the ABC network , which poured thousands of feet of brilliant color into the library each week . Network news has time for only a brief scene here and there to keep its viewers interested ; an indication , merely , of reality . We appreciated the commercial possibilities of a series for black children , who would now study themselves as they did the people of Mexico and Japan . I was heartily sick of viewing such scenes . Still , it would sell . But what would the framework of such a series be ? " Go out and see what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said my employers . I was obedient and loyal . I took the list . I selected , listened , and made notes , searching for some theme , a cohesive direction upon which to build our success . Black . certainly . But black what ? r111-1I7S , IN VENAL INNOCENCE , were I the muted chords exposed . At first , however , all of this was , simply , just another series , one among many I had done : Churchill , Truman , CBS 's 20th Century , NBC 's Project 20 , Battleline , Survival , Protest . Entering this other world there was only a slow ? very slow ? gathering of momentum , so gently was I prepared for the journey into the agonies of Judith Trotsky is a bunter and film editor . This essay was drawn from her batik Love Songs Froth 11u Boogeymen , to be published this fail by Harper 's Magazine Press . my self . Thus , like any analysis , memory ? and its relation to events currently taking place ? is , at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Gregory , becoming an audience of one for his routine . His delivery is still superb . I am always a comic 's gourmet , and so I settle down with a sense of cultivated delectation , savoring a feast of back-country tales . " Black folks in America got a callus round their souls , and if the system do n't back up , their shoe ? it 's going to be wore out . " Amos and Raggedy Andy happily flapping their soles on Harlem streets . Skip to another routine , a more serious bit of business here . Working hard , Gregory leans into the color camera 's eye . " A free man is a man with no fears , and when white folks fear me marrying their daughter , eating in their restaurants , going to their schools , living in their neighborhood , he is my slave by the law of nature whether he like it or not ! " There was always a line of truth in Gregory 's art . But the unpunctuated rush of passion is too heavy-handed an assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But though I flinch , he continues to accuse , for I must finish off this reel . " America is the number one racist country on the face of this earth ! " Drop dead . " We got a right ? a right to hate you the same forward way you hate us .. . We are tired of you young liberal white kids corning down South getting rid of your guilt bugging our Mississippi racist crackers when you ca n't take a nigger home with you . up North in the suburbs ! " Who the hell do you think you 're talking to ? My dialogue continues with the figure on my screen . You will not use such words to inc . I am always proper , and have politely made a change in my lexicon from " Negro " to your insisted " black . " THE MILITANT MONTH CONTINUES . I encounter Carmichael . Yet , though 1 can appreciate the blocks of fact that form the foundations of his speech , it is what he builds on them ? and how ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights of Tnugaloo College 's stage , his reasoning leads to the same sort of twisted illogic he has , with much justice , vehemently exposed in us . " If I said to you that Christopher Columbus discovered America in 1492 you would say that 's correct . But now here comes this honky from Spain . There are already nonwhite people here and they 're not existent until they come and discovered them . Ai n't that something ? " Ai n't that something ! " Skillfully , the rhythms of his speech rise and fall and rise again , each time to greater height , as he sucks his audience into waters boiling into a dangerous tidal wave . Master of the technique , a mounting , arm-waving peroration that drenches the cloth of his well-cut yellow shirt . Finally thundering black fury : " America , " he screams , " can not tell the truth about herself . If she did , she would have to commit suicide . " Dramatically , he pauses , allowing the crowd to quiet itself ? seeming , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has just said . Then , softly , comes the curtain line . He smiles . " That might not be such a bad idea ! " The sea of young black people surges forward wildly . Agreed . They cheer . Death to all whites ! The leader speaks . Watching , my terrible recall vomits its own images , for I have been witness to this scene before , in black and white : the haloed figure , immersed in light , calls for death to all enemies , eliminate the alien race . Subtitled English was unnecessary . I understood then and understand once again . Should we let such swaying hatreds speak ? In pre-World War II America , Leni Riefenstahl 's extraordinary film proclaiming The Triumph of the Will was banned . Its genius was too subtle and too overpowering for the ordinary mind . Should we ban again this mastery when it is used in such a cause ? Are we stronger now ? I am not sure . But I find myself terrified at Carmichael 's obvious comprehension of the technique . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects to my person that you can explore , I think , very constructively . . . But we gather here to pay court to sensationalism , m . We gather here to pay court to negativism . . . You sit here and ask me one-dimensional questions that jail continually within the Negro-ness of my life . " I am an artist . Man . American . Contemporary . I 'm an awful lot of things . So I wish you would pay me the respect due and not simply ask me about those things ! " Behind the cameras , applause rings out . Absently I make a note of it , for I am thinking of other things . Man . Contemporary . American . Artist . Simple words , strong in their effect . Staring at the face magnified by the mirrors of the machine , 1 see a very human anger angry too . Why did he make me want to kill ? Is there a difference here ? Is there a time when anger is allowed ? Do we have a right to rage ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Brown ? The question invades with a terrible pertinence to my life . I have been the silent child , fearful and invisible . But I , too , have angers deep inside . They pay court to a paper doll on whose head is a six-pointed star . " Remember your place , " they say to me . But my life has not been a stagnant pool , dammed by a quicksand phrase . And , as I wind through the darkening reels , hidden currents begin to swirl . I am no longer what I was , the timid casualty of a war . I am grown . I have become , and now I am learning what I am . Emerging from my niggerhood , I see my reflection growing clear , and the pictures of myself I see are not how I 've been described . I am Woman . Contemporary . Perhaps I am an artist too . And my growing Poitier-pride is a defensive wall which can not be breached . It is Rap Brown who is the helpless child , drowning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull down even those who 'd rescue him . But I have joined Poitier now , forever losing my fear of H. Rap Brown . I can defend myself nonviolently simply by being what I am . I pay myself the respect due me . I have become . . . American . ONE DAY , INTF.TiriPTING my work to research a film about the march on Washington , I stumble across a man whose name , at the time , I do not even bother to note . Later , going hack , I find the cameraman 's report sheet with a scribbled note . It says , simply , " a Mr. Sharpe . " ) He is not one of the leaders , and thus of no use in our " black box . " But there is something in his voice that slows my hands from whirling through the reel : " They say we are apes , monkeys . . . less than human . But I know I am as great as any white man that ever lived and ever will live . We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creative people . " We just do n't want to be the bricklayer. k e want to be the designer , the architect . We just do n't want to be the pilot of the plane . We want to be the designer of the plane . Do you understand what I 'm trying to say ? " No . But I hear . " These are the things that we feel . These are the things that we know we have to do . . . We have to establish our identity . We have to regain back our culture . We have to get our stolen heritage . These things have been denied us too long as people .. . We are hungry . We 're starving . We 're crying inside . And white America refuses to hear . " I HEAR . I HEAR . But what does it mean ? I have been through the Long March of your people ; and I , too , have mourned . But in this land of freedom , what guilt is mine , whose family history includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , truly , understood your words , for having heard the argument too many times before , I have now heard something else . I have heard your music : a faint melody , derivative perhaps , but shaped by your recital of it into a furtherance of form , an extension of principles long since become classic : compacted , molded , reshaped in your pressure-cooked black mind until it is no longer a verbal symphony presented , once removed , upon a stage where it can be viewed with safety . I do not understand . But you have , somehow , involved me in the tragedy of your life . Black Everyman ? Sta. - olee ? had you , somewhere , heard Shylock speak ? Uneducated , inarticulate people , you have , unnoticed , brought to this deadened world a new age of oratory . It is black . UI ROM THE QUICKENING TRACK r now comes the sound of another voice . The Rev. Ralph David Abernathy preaching to his people in their native tongue : a Passion in the Black Vernacular . " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out from nowhere into Somewhere and spoke in the midst of darkness . And there was light . Oceans began to flow . Streams came into being . Plants began to bloom . I 'm talking about a God . Do you know Him ? " Shoulders heaving , he tells us all : " If you 're burdened down , He 's a burden-bearer . If your heart is wrong , He 's a heart-fixer . If your mind is disturbed , He 's a mind-regulator . " Again he asks : " Do you know Him ? " The fervor of response fills the room . Free , joyous , shouting , unrestricted : a litany of faith responsive to the combustible poetry of love . A thousand miles away in space , and months removed in time , I , too , want to join , shouting my belief . What belief ? I have been a relapsed everything . Against the deadly gases long ago I masked myself . It is impossible to separate the fumes of hate and love , death and life . Or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shepherd ; I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . . He restoreth my soul .. .55 " Black , " Adam Powell says to ire . " is not the color of your skin . Black is the way you think . " And with a burble of all-male laughter , Muhammad All concurs : " We do n't hate those of you who are white . We just want to stay black . We love our color . 1 just love my-self ! " Love . Champ . I would love to meet that man . Love is a word I do not use anymore . But now I wish to speak of love . And : Streams flow through the mists of darkness . Plants bloom on rapids ' rocks . Do you know him ? " Black is not the color of your skin . Black is the way you think . " Black is the voice of silence gone . " I just love myself .
