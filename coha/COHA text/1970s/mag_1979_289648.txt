New albums by Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles strike fire <P> Some weeks ago , during the very particular and graceful lull of an English Sunday afternoon , two American travelers stopped by a pub in the village of Blandford , Dorset . The air was thick with Player 's smoke and jollity , the sound of gentle joking , the slide and click of coins across the worn wood of the bar , and the easygoing strains of the new Eagles album . <P> Released just days before , The Long Run , an adept and insinuating work by the regents of California pop , had already crossed the ocean , penetrated cultural barriers where some resistance might have been anticipated , and found a snug home for itself . Besides being a reminder of the international power of American pop music , hearing The Long Run in Blandford helped to take the Eagles out of cultural context . It lifted them from the category of stainless-steel Los Angeles pop , in which they are usually confined on their home turf , and let their music stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballads , always a group specialty , floated free and easy . Songs like The Long Run and The Sad Cafe seemed to sink right into your memory . The current hit single Heartache Tonight , or In the City , a hard dose of metropolitan late nights , or the ironic frat-house rocker The Greeks Do n't Want No Freaks sounded rambunctious in a way that is new for the group . <P> The Eagles , one of America 's top-selling acts ( their last album , 1976 's Hotel California , sold 12 million copies worldwide ) , have been popular favorites even as they have endured some tough drubbing from the critics . The group , particularly Co-Writers Don Henley and Glenn Frey , have been taking it on the chin for such presumed transgressions as coldness , stylistic calculation and lyrical arrogance . Some of this criticism is justified . The Eagles are a motivating commercial force in rock more than a creative one . The Sad Cafe tries to shape a coda for the ' 60s by shoring up all the cliches of a generation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , " " lonely crowd " ) and firing them off like salvos . The song becomes unwieldy , but its graceful melody rescues it . Henley and Frey have better luck closer to home , in the jokey , hokey bacchanal of The Greeks Do n't Want No Freaks or the sly ironies of The Disco Strangler ( a collaboration with String Player Don Felder ) and King of Hollywood , in which a hard-hustling mogul is nailed neatly in two fleet lines : " He 's just another power junky/ Just another silk-scarf monkey . " <P> Fleetwood Mac , a band whose average lyric has the approximate weight and consistency of a summer breeze , have become the smash success story of the late ' 70s . They even outpoint the Eagles ; their last album , 1977 's Rumours , has rung up sales of something like 15 million copies . Their new album , Tusk , is two records ' worth of prime Mac material ; they may even be cueing it up in Dorset right now .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
