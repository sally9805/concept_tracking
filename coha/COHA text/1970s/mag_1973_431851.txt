 | Why Wives Cheat on Their Husbands FOR THE average woman , sexuality is a serious business . Most of what matters in her life ? her pregnancies , her moods , her menstrual problems ( or lack of them ) , her children , her happiness ? is influenced by the quality of her sexual relationship with her husband . As a result , although perhaps one in four wives commits adultery at least once in her life , it is usually only with the greatest reluctance that a woman abandons the sexual security of her husband for a new and relatively unknown partner . In fact , most women who become sexual cheats do so only when they feel that the most critical areas of their lives are slipping out of their control . Sometimes that can happen as early as the first year of marriage , as was the case with Marcia : " Even before my honeymoon was over , I felt I 'd been short-changed . I guess I wanted sex to be some psychedelic jackpot that made the whole world light up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right but I kept thinking , Is that all there is ? Is that all there really is ? ' So , after six months , I looked up one of my old boy friends . Well , it took me only one gruesome afternoon with him to realize that I was a lot better off with my husband than with anyone else . " Marcia found out the hard way what most well-adjusted married women already know ? that sexually speaking , nearly all men are created equal . There are no magic techniques . True sexual satisfaction for husband and wife is the result of cooperation , mutual dedication and a certain amount of hard work . Strangely enough , after the first  | full year of marriage , lack of sexual satisfaction is no longer the primary motivation for the wife who cheats . By then it is usually disappointment with the whole concept of marriage that drives a woman to sample the charms of another man . Karen is a good example : " In college I was Homecoming Queen and had more boys after me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was all over ? no more dates , no more expensive restaurants , no more good times . So I started going out on my own , not so much for the sexual part but because it 's like it was before I was married . " Karen , of course , is an extreme case ? the most popular girl on campus who never grew up . But even more level-headed wives from time to time are aware of the contrast between being a sweetheart and being a wife . Between the fifth and seventh years of marriage , the temptation to be unfaithful strikes women in another way . By then , many husbands have just rounded the first turn of the career rat race and are devoting more of their time and energy to their jobs ? and less to their wives ? than ever before . The wife who looks for another man while her husband works overtime may actually be more interested in conversa-@# tion than in caresses . After wrestling with children , housework , shopping , dogs and cats , door-to-door salesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eating a solitary supper ? she begins to suffer from chronic emotional malnutrition . An extramarital affair provides her with adult human companionship at the same time it makes her feel wanted as a woman again . The next surge of infidelity among wives comes after 15 or so years of marriage . This is the point where some men begin to take their wives for granted sexually and emotionally . Many males at this stage are overburdened with business worries and are gradually pushing sex into the background ? their once or twice a week performance with their wives is uninspiring , to say the least . The wife , on the other hand , has her own set of problems to face . She may be starting to put on a little weight . When she looks in the mirror , she finds new wrinkles . At the same time that she sees her husband losing interest in her as a woman , she has disturbing visions of her own physical charms receding into the sunset . This is the famous " last-call-to-dinner " infidelity ? probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere at this stage is simply paying an inflated price ? in terms of emotional hazards and potential suffering ? for what should be available to her in the privacy of her own bedroom . She is trading her sexual favors for affection , interest and attention ? precisely what her 1973 WHY WIVES CHEAT ON THEIR HUSBANDS 125  | husband should be providing . Ironically , the man she has her affair with may be the fortyish husband of another woman who has the identical problem . Consider what happened to Gina : " Fred is about my husband 's age , but he seemed so different . George , my husband , would come home at night , eat his dinner , then fall asleep in front of the TV . It was n't exactly an evening with Charles Boyer . But Fred would take me to dinner , he paid attention to my opinions ? and when it came to sex , he acted as if he really cared . I even had daydreams about divorcing George and marrying Fred ? until I found myself at the hairdresser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peg . We got to talking , and she started telling me how her husband did n't pay attention to her , how he hardly talked to her when he came home ; how he 'd lost all interest in sex . Can you imagine that ? When it came to his own wife , my glamour boy was just as stodgy as my husband was to me ! " From time to time , there are immature and insecure husbands who literally force their wives to be unfaithful . Lois tells what happened to her : " Frank would call me from work every afternoon . If I was out , he 'd keep calling until I answered . And then he 'd start interrogating me : Where was I ? Who was I with ? Sometimes he 'd come home early just to catch ' me . Finally , I said , If I was going to fool around , you 'd never know about it ! ' He said , I dare you to try it ! ' So I tried it . I certainly called my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ren-dezvous ? " Lois burst into tears . " It was awful ! I knew it was going to be awful ! Frank is the only man I care about , but I just had to get him to stop hounding me . He would never have known about what I did if I had n't told him . " " You told him ? " " Of course . That was the idea . I explained to him that if he trusted me he would never really have to worry about anything I did . And if he did n't trust me ? well , his worst fears would come true . He went out for a long walk , and when he came back , he apologized . He 's never mentioned the subject again . " Lois ' experience had several common characteristics of feminine infidelity . First , it was impulsive . She selected her " partner in crime " more for the effect he would have on her husband than out of any true emotional feeling for him . Second , she made sure her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of infidelity is to strike out at the husband . Third , Lois ' husband agreed to forgive and forget . More often than not , wives who cheat are given a second ? or even third ? chance by their husbands . There are reasons for that . Generally , the male ego recoils at the idea of publicly admitting that a wife has chosen the sexual favors of another man . In addition , much of the time the wife who cheats has  | made her point , and there is a dramatic change in the marriage from that time on . Understanding the motivation behind feminine infidelity is , of course , important ? but more vital is using the knowledge to prevent that sort of sexual double-cross from ever occurring . For example , in a way , " infidelity prevention " begins on the honeymoon . By the end of the first week of marriage even the most skeptical husband usually recognizes that his wife has sexual needs just as real as his own . The fellow who refuses to provide his wife with sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . Unfortunately the male version of the " sick headache " is more common than most men are willing to admit . Another point : Every human being needs attention ? but a wife particularly needs that special kind of attention that involves tenderness , understanding and reassurance . The moment a woman decides her husband does n't " care " about her anymore , she becomes vulnerable to the temptation of infidelity . An ounce of prevention on the part of the husband is worth years of constant worry . As Jack explains : " When I found out Ellen was going out with another man , I fell apart . Finally , I went to see our minister to ask him to take care of the kids after I left . I do n't know how he did it , but he explained to ni what was really going on . He said that Ellen 's infidelity was really desperate cry for help . He said she did n't want another man ? she just wanted the man she married . That made sense to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been home one night out of ten 1br months . We 're back together again now , and I 'm giving her all of me she can stand . That was four years ago , and so far I have n't heard any complaints . " When it comes to preventing in fidelity , " sexual disarmament " can be the best friend a man and woman ever had . All man and wife have to do is agree that sexuality should never be misused as a weapon . They can argue in the living room , throw crockery in the kitchen , but the bedroom ? and the bed ? must always be neutral territory where wounds are healed , not inflicted . If a man and woman can see each other as lovers and friends and allies ? instead of adversaries ? they will have achieved a very important goal . Their only contact with feminine infidelity is likely to be limited to watching it acted out on second-rate television soap operas ? which , after all , is where it belongs . @#    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
