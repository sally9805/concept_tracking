In 1903 a dapper little man in a stiff celluloid collar named Harry von Tilzer was the king of American popular music . He was the president of the hottest sheet music publishing company in New York City , and of all the writers he published , none was more successful than Harry von Tilzer . Hugely prolific , he sometimes wrote as many as three songs a day . He once claimed that although he had published more than three thousand of his own songs during his lifetime , he had written close to one thousand before he had his first hit . Harry could afford to be modest . Harry von Tilzer wrote more hits than anyone had ever dreamed of at that time . With the royalties from songs like " She 's Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage , " " Wait Till the Sun Shines , Nellie , " and " I Want a Girl Just Like the Girl Who Married Dear Old Dad , " he could live like the king he was , buying a dozen suits at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to celebrate his latest hit . The turf over which Harry ruled supreme was a single noisy block of Manhattan Island on 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues . It was a busy place filled with fly-by-night music publishers and fledgling composers trying to make their way . There was a florid-faced Irishman named Victor Herbert who had a flair for operettas , and George M. Cohan , a brash young vaudevillian who had left his family 's act to scare up money for a musical he had written called Little Johnny Jones . But everybody cleared the way when Harry von Tilzer stepped out on the street . He had only to hum a few bars and a dozen writers picked up their pencils to follow him . It was a natural , then , when Monroe Rosenfeld , a reporter for the New York Herald and a sometime composer himself , wanted to write a story on the local music scene , that he should go to Harry von Tilzer . Sitting in the great man 's office and listening to a dozen pianos banging away , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone pounding on tin pans . He filed his story and called the area " Tin Pan Alley . " It was one of those naturals . From that day on it had no other name . So there really was a place called Tin Pan Alley . In fact , there were several . Before getting its distinctive name , the popular music center flourished in the late 1800 's around Union Square where the sounds of music filled the air every night . There was Tony Pastor 's Musical Hall where people like Lillian Russell and Eddie Foy held forth . Across the way was the Academy of Music , America 's premier opera house which was so socially elevated that the Vanderbilts could n't get their own box seats . Nearby was the Alhambra , which housed gigantic musical extravaganzas . A bit down the road were places like the Dewey Burlesk House , where Weber and Fields knocked them dead , and the Hubert Prospect Garden where the beer flowed like  --  well , it flowed like beer . When the legitimate theaters moved uptown , Tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eventually moved with the main stem on up to the West Forties . Tin Pan Alley was always as much a spirit and idea as it was a geographic location . It went where the action was . Finally , like a herd of lemmings , the denizens of Tin Pan Alley followed the action to their deaths . But while they lived , they made a joyful noise . If Tin Pan Alley had a father , he was a banjo player from Milwaukee named Charles K. Harris . Only sixteen years old , Charles was a pretty fair player who picked up extra money working as a bellhop and clerking in a local pawnshop . One evening he went to see a touring show called The Skating Rink , starring comedian Nat Goodwin . Harris noticed that the songs in the show had nothing to do with the action of the play . Goodwin would simply hold up his hand , stop the show in its tracks , and rip off a number . Harris came up with the then unique idea that it would be more effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the action . He sat down and wrote his first song , " When Maggie Learned to Skate , " and got Goodwin to sing it in the show . Encouraged by his success , he opened a one-room office on Grand Street , and hung out his shingle : Charles K. Harris Banjoist and Songwriter Songs Written to Order Right there was what was to be the driving spirit of Tin Pan Alley . Songs written to order . Songs to fit . Songs for any occasion . Songs for any artist . If youhad a play or a dog act , Charles K. Harris would write a song for you . When he was only twenty-five , Harris hit that jackpot songwriters are always looking for . Walking by a dance hall in Chicago , he saw a young couple storming out having a raging argument . The couple separated , and Harris thought to himself , " Many a heart is aching after the ball . " Just as they do in the movies , Harris was hit by an inspiration and rushed home to compose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he had a good song , but he had also learned from experience that making money out of it was something else . The royalties from his first published song amounted to exactly eighty-five cents . A songwriter 's royalties in those days came almost entirely from the sales of sheet music and piano rolls . But before people would buy the song they had to hear it . Harris set about on another innovation that became standard practice in Tin Pan Alley for years to come . He went to musical comedy star J. Aldrich Libbey , who was appearing in an extravaganza called A Trip to Chinatown , and paid him $500 to work " After the Ball " into the show . Libbey took the money and a small percentage of the royalties and stuck it in the second act where it was the showstopper of showstoppers . The audience cheered for a good five minutes . Within a few weeks , demands for the sheet music were so heavy that Harris had to buy his own printing press to run off enough copies . He sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one week . In time , " After the Ball " sold more than five million copies and made Charles K. Harris a millionaire . He moved to New York and ran a successful publishing company for many years . He never wrote another song as popular as " After the Ball , " but on Tin Pan Alley it takes only one . More importantly , he set the Tin Pan Alley formula : " First you got to write them but then you got to sell them . " Before the turn of the century " selling " songs was unheard of . The distinguished sheet music publisher , Firth , Pond &; Co. , was delighted to reap a harvest of cash from the music of Stephen Foster but it was considered vulgar for a purveyor of the works of Mozart and Schubert to encourage sales . Tin Pan Alley changed all that . It took the art of song plugging to new highs  --  or lows , depending on your point of view . The best way to make a song known was to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accomplish this were accepted practice . There was a regular pecking order , depending on the performer . Orchestra leaders were slipped small sums of cash or a box of fine cigars . Lady singers were offered jewels , and even a man with nothing more than an animal act could expect a little something extra for playing the right song in the background while the seals did their juggling . For big stars , the sky was the limit . Al Jolson used to get expensive racehorses for introducing a new song . To encourage performers to sing particular songs , there were two other legitimate lines to attack . There were " outside pluggers " or " boomers " who would set up shop in open store fronts or out on the sidewalks where actors would be likely to pass , and strike up whenever they appeared . If there was any sign of interest , the performer was turned over to an " inside plugger " who had a small office at the publisher 's and worked with the singer on the new song . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gershwin and Vincent Youmans first learned their craft . Plants inside the theater audience were common . The plant would sit waiting for one of his publisher 's songs to be sung . When it was , he leapt to his feet , apparently stunned by the beauty of the song , and sang it back at the performer . Children were especially effective in this kind of work , and Gus Edwards , who later became a songwriter and impresario in his own right , made a youthful career out of being a plant . His forte was the sentimental ballad , and he became a fixture in the balcony of the old Hurtig and Seaman 's Burlesk Theater , where he helped make hits of such tearjerkers as " Do n't Send My Boy to Prison " and " A Mother 's Plea for Her Son . " The child labor laws were not rigidly enforced at the turn of the century , and no one was too young to plug a song . Vaudeville theaters used to have young boys bring drinking water to customers between the acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out that while the kids were bringing trays they might as well be singing a song at the same time . Eventually young boy singers were at such a premium for this kind of work that publishers took to raiding church choirs and synagogues for talent . The prize catch was a slim young boy from Baltimorenamed Asa Yoelson , who later changed his name to Al Jolson . The " singing stooge " became such a part of the theatrical scene that eventually they stopped pretending and were worked directly into the act . One of Irving Berlin 's first jobs was at the Tony Pastor 's Music Hall where he worked with an acrobat act called The Three Keatons . The youngest member of the troupe was named Buster , who went on to other things . Tin Pan Alley was made up of a lot of people : publishers and pluggers , stars and children who should have been home in bed . But most of all , it was made up of men who had come to town to write music . Some , like Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were superbly trained musicians . Others were virtually musical illiterates . George M. Cohan , the only songwriter to have a statue in his honor dedicated in New York , set a nation singing while knowing only four chords in the black keys of F sharp . Irving Berlin always bristles when people say he can only play the piano with one finger . " I can use all ten , " he replies ; " it 's just that I play badly with all ten . " But to this day Berlin ca n't write his own music . He has to dictate it to someone else who actually puts the notes down on paper . But all these men had one thing in common . They had songs to sing and we have been singing them ever since . Harry von Tilzer was known as Mr. Tin Pan Alley , and no one deserved the title more . He came to New York in 1893 , just when things were getting started , and when he died in 1946 , Tin Pan Alley was gone , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home at the age of fourteen and hooked up with the Cole Brothers Circus in a tumbling act . Somewhere along the line he decided that Gumm was n't much of a stage name , so he changed it to his mother 's maiden name of Tilzer . He rolled that around for a while and then inserted the " von " because he felt it had class . Harry had a yen to make it big as a songwriter . He hired out as a groom in a railroad car full of horses and worked his way east , arriving in New York with a suitcase full of songs and total cash assets of $1.65 . He got a job as a piano player in a saloon and set about trying to sell his songs . It was tough sledding for a while , and Harry was lucky to sell a few for $2 apiece to vaudeville and burlesque performers . He must have felt as if he swindled a neighborhood print shop owner named William Dunn into buying " My Old New 0 Hampshire Home " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $15 each . But suddenly , in the best bad movie fashion , both songs took off . " My Old New Hampshire Home " became a favorite of dramatic tenors and eventually racked up sheet music sales of more than two million copies , while young Blanche Ring took " I 'd Leave My Happy Home For You " out on the vaudeville circuit and rode it to stardom and a million-copy sale . Mr. Dunn found himself a wealthy music publisher overnight , and Harry von Tilzer had a swift thirty dollars . But he had two hits to his name , and Tin Pan Alley always rallied around a writer with a hot hand . In the early 1900 's hits seemed to pour out of Harry 's pen . Many of them , like " Wait Till the Sun Shines , Nellie , " are almost as well known today as they were when they were racking up million-copy sales seventy years ago . There was a deep sentimental streak in Harry 's songs and , like " The Mansion of Aching Hearts , " they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his most enduring ballads was " A Bird in a Gilded Cage . " According to Tin Pan Alley legend , lyricist Arthur Lamb wanted the girl in the song , " whose beauty was sold for an old man 's gold , " to be a wealthy man 's mistress , but von Tilzer was adamant that she be a legally married woman . Von Tilzer 's moral position must have struck Lamb as a little strange since his friend had composed the melody while sitting at the piano of one of New York 's more elegant brothels . Harry later said he played it for the ladies of the establishment and when they all cried he knew he had a hit , a two-millionseller , by the way . In 1925 , Harry found the parade was passing him by and he began to lapse into an unhappy retirement . He had gone many years without a hit when one day he received a letter enthusiasm but no particular promise . When he asked his father for permission to go to Europe to continue his studies , the elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the family store in Newark . Kern 's business career was spectacularly brief . Sent to New York one day to purchase a pair of pianos , Jerome so fell under the sway of the salesman that he ordered two hundred to be delivered instantly . Deciding that perhaps it was cheaper after all to let Jerome go to realization that symphonic composition was not for him . He returned to New York , got a job as an inside plugger and tried his hand at writing songs for musicals . From 1905 to 1912 he placed more than a hundred and twenty songs in some thirty different shows . This is the equivalent of writing four full musicals every season , a feat unparalleled in American music . Generally , the songs were point numbers that came and went with the season , attracting only scant attention . In 1910 , when he was from his old friend , Elizabeth Marbury , who wrote to cheer him up , saying , " Just around the corner the Sun will shine for you . " Harry had n't been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to know a good song cue when he heard one . He sat down in his hotel room and write " Just Around the Corner . " Harry von Tilzer had one more smash hit . That was an exuberant time filled with wonderful melodies , but coming along shortly was a musical revolution . Born within a few years of each other , three young songwriters were just getting started in Tin Pan Alley around 1910 . Between them they would change the face of American music and unleash a flood of melody no one had ever heard before . They were Jerome Kern , Irving Berlin and George Gershwin . Tin Pan Alley was about to come of age . Jerome Kern would seem to be the most unlikely revolutionary . Listening to his lilting melbrought in to doctor a lame little musical called Mr. W ix of Wickham , he filled the score with such happy melodies he got one of his first Broadway reviews . Alan Dale , the respected critic of the old New York American , asked , " Who is this Jerome Kern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurdy-gurdy accompaniment of the present-day musical comedy ? " For the next thirty-five years he would answer that with a flood of melody . His first huge success came in an inconsequential little musical imported from England called The Girl from Utah . On the opening night , August 24 , 1914 , petite Julia Sanderson stood on the stage with a small amber spotlight on her while she sang " They Did n't Believe Me , " and the American musical theater could never be the same . Today the song seems just a simple but lovely example of Jerome Kern at his most lyrical . It was composed in the normal thirty-two bars and of the theater with shows like Forty-five Minutes from Broadway and Little Nelly Kelly , but Cohan 's songs were really in the nineteenth-century tradition . They were glorious melodies , to be sure , but essentially Cohan 's shows were musical pageants , designed to be sung , said one historian , " out of one corner of the mouth with an American flag stuffed in the other . " " They Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music historian David Ewen points out , its apparent simplicity masked a technical tour de force . " A climax is achieved with a magical and totally unexpected change of key ; a new four-measure thought is suddenly interpolated in the recapitulation section of the chorus ; the rhythm is changed from quarter- and half-notes to triplets without warning . " It was the kind of song that forced Harry von Tilzer into retirement . From then on , neither Kern nor musical comedy could look back . A sixteen-year-old George Gershwin was mesmerized when he first heard the song and wrote later that he knew he had found a model . For Kern , the rest of his career was an almost unbroken string of successes . He wrote a series of small , stylishly sophisticated musicals known as The Princess Theater Shows , which included hits like " Oh , Boy " and " Lady ! Lady ! " that were so popular they had to be run simultaneously in two theaters to handle the crowds . In 1928 , Jerome Kern again took the musical theater by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Show Boat . According to Richard Rodgers , who should know , " That was the big one . Show Boat is where modern American musical comedy begins . " For the rest of his life , Kern wrote melodies for Broadway and Hollywood with equal facility , and the Hit Parade never went very long without a Jerome Kern song like " Smoke Gets in Your Eyes , " " Who Cares , " " All the Things You Are " and " I 've Told Every Little Star " among the top ten . When he died in 1945 , he left a legacy of music that will last as long as people still sing " Why Do I Love You ? " which according to one historian will be at least " Till the Clouds Roll By . " Some men lead lives filled with such prodigious creativity that it is all but impossible to tell their story in the usual way . As in describing an iceberg , the writer has to fall back on statistics just to give a hint of its true size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following : Berlin wrote his first hit song , the stupendously successful " Alexander 's Ragtime Band " in 1911 , and forty years later the hottest ticket in New York was to " Call Me Madam . " In between he wrote more songs , had more hits and made more money than any songwriter in America 's history . His theatrical shows were so popular that Sam Harris built a theater , the Music Box , just for them . His songs are so enduring that although he has not been active for the last twenty-five years his publishers list 899 still bringing in royalties . And what royalties . He wrote " Always " and gave the rights to his wife for their anniversary , and it has since netted her more than $500,000 . From " White Christmas " he earned $1 million in one year alone . His charity is legendary . During World War II , he wrote the successful musical , This Is the Army , and gave all profits to the Army Emergency Relief Fund . Eventually the show netted the service $9.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggled all his career against the calumny that he played the piano with only one finger . No immigrant to these shores ever believed in the American dream as completely as Irving Berlin did , and he celebrated it in song all of his life . Born Izzy Baline , he came to America as a small boy when his family fled the Jewish persecution of czarist Russia in 1892 . Life was hard for the Balines , and young Izzy ran away from home at the age of fourteen and supported himself by singing sentimental ballads on the street for whatever pennies he could collect . Harry von Tilzer heard him singing " The Mansion of Aching Hearts " and hired him as a song plugger and singing stooge for more of von Tilzer 's songs in a raspy but touching tenor . Berlin had a small success placing songs in shows and wrote a few popular Jewish comedy songs like " Good-bye Becky Cohen " for young Fanny Brice , who was just getting started in vaudeville . For the next sixteen years , Berlin had the Midas touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , not only for himself , but for everyone connected with him . In his score for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1919 , he gave Marilyn Miller one of her biggest hits in " Mandy , " and introduced Eddie Cantor to Broadway audiences singing " You 'd Be Surprised , " which was Cantor 's biggest recording hit . Almost as an afterthought , he wrote " A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody , " which served as the theme song for all the Ziegfeld shows to come . In the Music Box Revue of 1923 he wrote " All Alone " and " What 'll I Do ? " and gave them to an unknown girl from Slabtown , Tennessee , named Grace Moore . In 1927 he wrote a beautiful but strangely prophetic song called " The Song Is Ended , " and suddenly , inexplicably , the well went dry . He wrote practically nothing for five years . The Wall Street crash of 1929 wiped out the considerable fortune he had amassed , and a disconsolate Irving Berlin became convinced he was washed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them he did n't offer them for publication and shoved them into a drawer . A friend went behind his back , dug out one of the songs and persuaded Rudy Vallee to sing it . " Say It Is n't So " was a big hit and encouraged Berlin to go back to the trunk and pull out another reject . " How Deep Is the Ocean ? " was one of his biggest hits and Irving Berlin was back on top . George Gershwin said that Berlin was America 's Franz Schubert and certainly no other American composer has filled the air with so many beautiful melodies . Most composers nurture a personal style . Gershwin has a driving intensity to his music that stamps his work as typically " Gershwin , " just as Cole Porter 's playfully sophisticated way with a song is unmistakable . But for sixty years Berlin had no particular " style " or " specialty . " He simply wrote every kind of song there was : pop tune , ballad , comedy song , march , waltz and swing . Musicologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as " Heat Wave , " " What 'll I Do , " " Cheek to Cheek , " " God Bless America , " " Easter Parade " and " Oh , How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning , " and then proving that it 's musically impossible for the same man to have written them all . As Jerome Kern once said , " Irving Berlin has no place in American music . He is American music . " Of these three giants , the youngest was George Gershwin . Born in 1898 , he seemed to sense that he did n't have much time to write down all the music he had in his head . In a meteoric career , he ran faster and aimed higher than any of them . Preeminent as a Broadway songwriter , he wrote hit pop tunes by the barrelful and was the only man in Tin Pan Alley to be regarded as a really " serious " American co m poser . George Gershwin was literally consumed by music from the time he was six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " played in an automatic piano arcade . When he was twelve , his parents bought an upright piano for his brother , Ira , but George practically pushed him aside to get at the keyboard to try to pick out the popular tunes of the day and try a few of his own . A hardworking boy who wanted nothing but to be connected with music , George attracted the attention of Max Dreyfus , the head of Harms Publishing Company . " He 's the kind of boy I like to take a gamble on , " Dreyfus said , and gave him a job at $35 a week to do nothing but write tunes and show them to Dreyfus . It was a gamble that paid off handsomely for both . Gershwin had his first big success with " Swanee , " which Al Jolson put into his hit show , Sin bad , which was then running . From that day on Gershwin never looked back . Starting in 1924 , he unleashed a blitzkrieg of hit Broadway shows that is perhaps without equal in the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way he wrote them : In 1924 , there was Lady Be Good ( 330 performances ) with Fred and Adele Astaire , and songs like the title song and " Fascinating Rhythm " ; in 1925 there was Tip-Toes ( 194 performances ) with a young Jeanette MacDonald in the cast singing " Looking for a Boy " and " That Certain Feeling " ; in 1926 there was Oh , Kay ! ( 256 performances ) with Gertrude Lawrence singing " Someone to Watch Over Me . " In 1927 , there was Funny Face ( 244 performances ) with Fred Astaire doing his first number in white tie and tails and Adele singing " S'Wonderful . " The same year Marilyn Miller starred in Rosalie ( 335 performances ) singing " How Long Has This Been Going On ? " In 1928 , he leaped overto London for That 's a Good Girl ( 363 performances ) with the stylish Jack Buchanan singing " Sweet So and So . " In 1929 , Show Girl ( 111 performances ) was only a moderate hit , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Strike Up the Band ( 191 performances ) was a smash , with Bobby Clark and songs like " Soon " and " I 've Got a Crush on You . " In 1930 Ginger Rogers had her last Broadway show in Girl Crazy ( 272 performances ) which produced several hits including " Bidin ' My Time , " " But Not for Me " and " Embraceable You . " But the hit of the night was when a newcomer named Ethel Merman stepped out and sang the showstopper , " I Got Rhythm . " For theater trivia buffs , the pit band was fronted by Red Nichols and working as sidemen were Jimmy Dorsey , Gene Krupa , Jack Teagarden , Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman . In 1931 he topped it all off with Of Thee I Sing ( 441 performances ) , starring William Gaxton and Victor Moore in the first musical to win the Pulitzer Prize . In between , he also composed Rhapsody in Blue , the most successful piece of serious music ever written by an American , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris Suite . " And his masterpiece , Porgy and Bess , was still four years in the future . Gershwin was supremely self-confident about himself and his music  --  he once said that he thought his mother 's most admirable quality was that " she is so modest about me . " So when Porgy and Bess opened to indifferent reviews , he kept up a brave front . " It 's even more wonderful than I thought it was , " he said after opening night . " I 'm not worried . Its time will come . " Its time did come , and it is now acknowledged throughout the world asthe greatest American opera . Some of George 's friends were afraid he was going high-hat on them with works like Porgy , but as he wired a friend from Hollywood , " Do n't believe what you read in the papers . Am only interested in writing hits . " He went to Hollywood and did just that , including " They Ca n't Take That Away From Me , " " A Foggy Day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the height of his powers , Gershwin suddenly began to experience agonizing headaches , which after a misdiagnosis were finally discovered to be the result of a brain tumor . He was rushed to the hospital but it was too late . He died the following morning . America 's premier talent was dead at thirty-nine , and we can only guess what magnificent songs he took with him . These , then , were the three principal giants of modern Tin Pan Alley . Their magic drew others whose work holds up today as well as it ever did . They come from all over . Harold Arlen had been a piano player on the laker steamboats near Buffalo . Arlen is one of those self-effacing craftsmen who seem destined to be the most performed and least recognized of all major American composers .

As Carmichael looked up at the starry sky the theme came to him , and he rushed over to the college bookstore where he persuaded the owner to stay open for an extra half hour so he could get it down on paper .

Working with Fred Astaire in Gay Divorce , Porter sat down and wrote a song specifically designed to suit Astaire 's limited vocal range . The song was " Night and Day . " Ethel Merman was different . Her best notes were C natural and B flat so Porter incorporated them into " 1 Get a Kick Out of You .

Most Tin Pan Alley composers split their time between writing popular songs and crafting shows for Broadway and Hollywood . Rodgers , however , is almost entirely a creature of the theater , and only rarely has he ventured away from the stage . Although when he has , such as " Blue Moon " and the music for Victory at Sea , the results have been spectacular . Writing in the tradition of Jerome Kern , whom he idolized , Rodgers is today America 's best known and best loved active composer . The only question is whether the bright and spritely musicals he wrote in the Twenties and Thirties with Lorenz Hart are more memorable than the lushly sentimental ones he wrote in the Forties and Fifties with Oscar Hammerstein II .

For a while , Hollywood got most of it . Warner Brothers spent $10 million to buy up Harms , Witmark and Remmick , three of the old-line publishing houses , just to have a source of movie music . New York was no longer the country 's popular music center , and some of the Alley 's best composers , like Kern and Gershwin , packed up and moved west . Others disappeared into radio and started writing bridge music for soap operas . The small publishing house , which had been the backbone of Tin Pan Alley , could n't survive . Those that were n't bought by giant conglomerates simply went under . And with them went people like Max Dreyfus , who gave Jerome Kern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week to learn their trade .

So was the advent of radio , which could take a song out of the Alley and make it a nationwide hit overnight . But the real answer lies deeper and is actually quite simple . The songs of Tin Pan Alley were better than the songs of today , because the men who wrote them worked harder than the self-indulgent composers of today . Vincent Youmans , with his lilting melodies , like " Tea for Two " and " Time on My Hands , " seemed to be the most effortless of writers . Yet he agonized over every note . He worked so slowly and self-critically that he released only ninety-three songs which he felt were up to standard .

The choice really boils down to one between taxation and inflation . You the public can take it in the arm or the backside , but take it you must . Congress votes to spend real dollars ; they must come from either your paycheck or your savings . Since Congress has the overwhelming say on how much money is spent and on setting income tax rates , Congress decides for you . A great majority of congressmen undoubtedly believe you would prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus government operation goes ever up and income tax rates stay down . It is quite surprising that so many congressmen believe that excessive social welfare is good for us . We have gone far beyond the point of caring for the poor or supplying basic educational needs . Not owning a TV set is extreme poverty . There are places in the United States where government-supported college students are taught at government institutions although they can not read or write at the eighth-grade level . Our government is quite efficient at raising money by income tax or by inflating the dollar and depleting savings . The federal government is not nearly so efficient at spending money . The largest share of federal funds is spent on salaries for federal employees . The plush suburbs around Washington , D.C. now extend halfway to Richmond and all the way to Baltimore and Annapolis . They are made plush by federal dollars to federal employees . The zeal with which the congressional majority chooses to fund government programs by inflation ( a tax on savings ) is surprising . Over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny as they happily increased spending , lowered taxes on income and raised the inflationary tax on savings . They know better . It seems we are always waiting for an election year to be over so we can finally get around to responsible government . What is needed are more congressmen with the courage to face the issue squarely regardless of coming elections . In the hinterlands there are finally signs that the public has begun to rebel against the oppressive social cost of a lavish Congress . The fiscal responsibility of Governor Brown of California is refreshing . A far happier omen is the popularity of Governor Brown 's programs . At the other end of the land , Governor Ella Grasso of Connecticut is laying off state employees to balance her state budget . There is only one way we can round the corner and end our disastrous flirtation with socialism ; we must . turn our backs on its prophets.
