Increasing acts of terrorism round the world were bound to make travel tougher . Now the U.S. has clamped down on unwelcome visitors by requiring visas of anyone who visits the country , even in transit ; Canadians alone are exempted . On its face , the decision seems inhospitable . Up to now , anyone who felt like it could spend ten days in the U.S. without having to get a visa . <P> The American Government has reasons for changing its policy . According to U.S. officials , in the last year some 5,000 persons have entered the U.S. supposedly in transit , only to disappear . When they reappear , many have a complete set of forged papers , including birth certificates and passports . Not all are foreigners who merely wish to beat the immigration quotas . There is evidence that some have planned attacks on diplomats at the U.N . Representatives of any country with determined enemies are targeted for trouble : Israel , the Soviet Union , Egypt , Lebanon . Such is the ecumenical spirit of terrorism .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
