A popular travel book this summer is London on $500 a Day ( Macmillan ; $7.95 ) , a not-so-whimsical guide for " the well-heeled sybarite . " In a season when sybarites , and a lot of other people , are staying home in herds , the book has not notably eased Harold Wilson 's balance of payments problems . As its title suggests , however , the shoestring vacation abroad has gone the way of the Gladstone bag and $4 Mot et Chandon . <P> Zooming air fares , European inflation and the dwindling power of the dollar have combined to squeeze the annual American exodus . From all indications , fewer than 7 million Americans will go overseas this year , down about 7% from 1974 , and about 20% below halcyon 1973 .

Others have stretched shrunken dollars by taking leisurely barge trips through the English countryside or hopscotching across the Continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 Western European countries . <P> Free Champagne . More and more vacationers have whittled air fares by booking charter flights and package tours .
