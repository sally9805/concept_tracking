At the near edge of the ' 70s , Americans have a sense that they-and perhaps the rest of mankind-are approaching a future uniquely and utterly unknown , except for its dangers . Pollution succeeds nukes as the likeliest means of self-destruction . The Russians and Chinese may never attack , but what about the black and white radicals at home ? And what if such rebellions should arouse a repression presided over by ideological jackboots ? There are historical patterns of such moods , recurring cycles of hope and dread . Nearly a century ago , in the midst of the American industrial revolution , Walt Whitman wrote a kind of sermon to America on its future . Except for his rambunctious optimism-a quality that would now seem at least reckless-he might have been talking to the nation today : <P> The storm shall dash thy face , <P> the murk of war and worse <P> than war shall cover Thee all over , ( Wert capable of war , its tug <P> and trials ? be capable of <P> peace , its trials , For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in <P> prosperous peace , not war ; ) ... But thou shah face thy fortunes , <P> thy diseases and surmount them <P> all . . . The Present holds Thee not-for such vast growth as thine , For such unparallel 'd flight as <P> thine , such brood as thine , The future only holds Thee <P> and can hold Thee .                     @x At the near edge of the ' 70s , Americans have a sense that they-and perhaps the rest of mankind-are approaching a future uniquely and utterly unknown , except for its dangers .
