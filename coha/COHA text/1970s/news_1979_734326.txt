txt Political turmoil and indecision are taking a grave toll of India 's economic growth . After several months of sharp deterioration , today the nation 's economy is in a shambles . Whoever rules India in the next few months will have to fight a vigorous holding operation to avert a drift to total disaster . When Morarji Desai 's government quit on July 15 after 28 months in office , it had given the country its sixth five-year plan , submitted 15 months late . Uncertainties like increased oil-import prices made planning exceptionally difficult , and the Desai government called its annual budgets " rolling plans . " This meant , in effect , that they existed only on paper . The Charan Singh government , which succeeded Desai 's after a brief political vacuum , is concerned more with problems of its own political survival than with the economy , at least for the time being . It has to win a vote of confidence in Parliament Aug. 20 to be able to stay on , and it Will take quite some time to formulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandate . Analysts think this drift puts the clock back for economic growth about two to three years . Two of the more immediate problems before India 's rulers are : ? An alarming inflation rate ? 13.5 percent in six months . ? Critical shortages of steel , cement , and fertilizer , which are caused largely by a coal shortage that has put a crimp in power generation . Both factors add to inflation .

India 's inability to control inflation has prompted new wage demands and added industrial unrest . The Desai government had been debating a package of inflationary measures , but had not reached any conclusions when it fell . While Charan Singh 's government has identified inflation as an immediate priority problem , it has not announced any tangible measures to curb price rises . Absence of any firm action against inflation in last 10 weeks may make this situation unmanageable . There has been an 18 percent increase in money supply . The Desai government was trying to make up for shortfalls of coal , steel , and cement with imports ? though India used to be a cement exporter , and has vast untapped coal reserves and an underutilized steel capacity . The result is that the nation is importing a stiff dose of inflation . World prices are higher than Indian prices . The only redeeming factor in the economy is a comfortable foodgrain buffer stock ( about 22 million tons ) , which the government finds hard to store , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
