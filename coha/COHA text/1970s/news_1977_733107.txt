txt As the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey prepares for the replacement of its retiring chairman , William J. Ronan , and for the arrival of a new executive director , it has been hit by three legal decisions . Two were mere jabs ; the third , a haymaker . Unless it can shake off the effects of that ' last blow , the authority might as well prepare to take the count . Of relatively minor importance to its tuture was the decision of the Supreme Court to forbid the use of Port Authority bond proceeds to finance rail transit , in violation of a promise to investors . Compromises could be worked out to permit the authority t ' borrow money for rail transport as long as the investments are adequately protected . Also minor  --  though politically embarrassing ? was the Federal court ruling that the authority could not forbid a reasonable test of the Concorde at its airports . But the third decision , by an administrative judge of the Department of Transportation , in effect forces the Port Authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earns no more than 6.5 percent on the investment in that bridge . If allowed to stand , this ruling would force a drastic reduction in the tolls on its four bridges from the present $l.50 ; to avoid chaotic traffic , tunnel tolls would no doubt have to be reduced as well . The reductions , in turn , would destroy the present plan to use $40 million in annual revenues to secure a loan of $240 million for the construction of mass-transit facilities in New Jersey and New York . Indeed , unless the Secretary of Transportation sets aside the ruling , the Port Authority will lose all ability to finance anything other than more toll bridges and tunnels . And it is the income from those river crossings that has made possible the borrowings needed to build truck and bus terminals and other regional facilities that could never pay for themselves . So the new management 's first job will be to persuade Washington to let the authority continue to use tolls to fund other projects . Then will come the difficult question of which projects will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be years before the Port Authority will again want to build what it builds best  --  bridges and airports . It may never again do what it has done worst  --  construct mammoth office buildings under the name of World Trade Center . Critics have long suggested that the authority should concentrate on creating a balance between rail and highway transportation . If this means that the Port Authority should own and operate passenger rail transit facilities , the prospect is dim . The authority 's own experience in operating the PATH rail system between Manhattan and northern New Jersey is not an inspiring precedent . When it took over the bankrupt Hudson and Manhattan railroad , the line 's annual loss was $8 million . After huge investments in new equipment , the loss has reached $40 million a year . Improvements in rail freight facilities are certainly in order . The most significant of these would be a railroad tunnel between New Jersey and Long Island , but its estimated cost of $500 million could not be financed in today 's world . Indeed , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer be justified by the present low level of carloadings in the port . This drop in freight traffic underlines the drop in the region 's share of ocean commerce . It demonstrates what the Port Authority 's staff already knows  --  that it must make a heavy commitment to economic development . The Port Authority is well poised to address the challenge of development . It is able to raise large sums in the bond market . It has the legal power to override local zoning codes and building laws . It knows how to assemble land and how to design structures . It even claims to be prepared to build power stations that would burn garbage as fuel . It hopes to use these skills to create industrial facilities for rent or sale to manufacturers . Still other skills will be needed to proceed on this path . The new chairman must persuade the Governors of New York and New Jersey to support the effort . Together , they must persuade their Legislatures to let the Port Authority borrow extensively for industrial development , overcoming interstate jealousies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director will need a technical background , a practical business sense , great administrative talent and fiscal expertise . The stakes are high . The Port Authority is a proven instrument for borrowing capital and repaying it ? no small distinction in these times  --  and it has proved capable of advancing industrial development in this region . If blocked from that task , the Port Authority 's new managers will be little more than toll collectors .
