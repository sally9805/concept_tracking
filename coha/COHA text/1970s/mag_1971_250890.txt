AND now , Moscow too . Bent on becoming a Sino-Soviet summiteer , Richard Nixon accepted an invitation to visit the Soviet capital late in May for talks with Soviet leaders that will cover " all major issues " affecting the two powers . The Moscow mission will thus apparently follow by several months the President 's journey to Peking . If the world does not , in fact , move from an era of confrontation to one of negotiation , it will clearly not be because Nixon did not try . <P> Yet it was still to Peking that the President was looking first . Only a few days after the Moscow announcement , National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger and nine aides took off for China to make arrangements for the Nixon trip , now expected to take place early in January . After a two-day stopover in Hawaii so that they can arrive rested , the group will spend four days in Peking . While Kissinger and State Department China Expert Alfred Le S. Jenkins seek agreement on a general agenda , other aides will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications satellite to facilitate press coverage . <P> After the China trip , if nothing upsets his plans , Nixon will become the first sitting U.S. President to visit Moscow and only the second to meet Russian leaders in the Soviet Union . Franklin Roosevelt traveled to Yalta for a fateful wartime conference with Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill in 1945 . Despite the postwar chill between the two nations , recent Presidents have been more than willing to seek better relations with the U.S.S.R. by going to Moscow . But Dwight Eisenhower 's plans to visit the Kremlin crashed with the shooting down of a U.S. spy plane over Russia in 1960 . At the time John Kennedy was killed , talks were under way about a possible presidential visit to Moscow in the spring of 1964 . Lyndon Johnson was about to announce his acceptance of a Soviet invitation when the Russians invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 . <P> No Euphoria . Nixon was tense and solemn as he announced his latest travel plans at an unscheduled press conference . Then he accepted questions . No , the trips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip is being taken for the purpose of exploiting what differences may exist between the two nations . " Yes , Peking had been informed of the Moscow plans . So had Japan and the NATO allies . Both trips will be working trips , will include both Secretary of State William Rogers and Kissinger , and will be attended by " an absolute minimum of ceremony . " Said Nixon : " The purpose of both visits is not simply cosmetics . We are not taking a trip for the sake of taking a trip . " He still felt that summit meetings without a probability of substantive agreements ought to be avoided , since they only " create euphoria . " Added the President : " We are not making that mistake . "
