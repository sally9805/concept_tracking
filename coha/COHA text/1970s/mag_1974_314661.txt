The transcripts of Nixon 's June 23 , 1972 , talks with H.R. Haldeman contained the " smoking howitzer " of evidence that was the decisive factor in ending the Nixon presidency . But they also offered fresh insights into Nixon 's attitudes toward people and issues . Among them : <P> <P> ON MONETARY MATTERS <P> When Haldeman advised the President that Britain had decided to let the pound float , and that the Italian lira was also in serious trouble , Nixon displayed remarkable casualness : <P> H : Did you get the report that the British floated the pound ? <P> P : No , I do n't think so . <P> H : They did . <P> P : That 's devaluation ? <P> H : Yeah . Presidential Assistant Peter Flanigan 's got a report on it here . <P> P : I do n't care about it . Nothing we can do about it . <P> H : You want a rundown ? <P> P : No , I do n't . <P> H : He argues it shows the wisdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary system . <P> P : Good . I think he 's right . It 's too complicated for me to get into . <P> H : Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur F. Burns expects a 5% devaluation against the dollar . <P> P : Yeah , O.K. Fine . <P> H : Burns is concerned about speculation about the lira . <P> P : Well , I do n't give a ( expletive deleted ) about the lira . <P> <P> ON HERBERT KLEIN <P> A close personal friend of Nixon 's and a longtime political adviser , Herbert Klein , 56 , was for years editor of the San Diego Union , and is now a vice president of the Metromedia broadcasting group in Los Angeles . He served as White House Director of Communications from 1969 to June 1973 . Nixon bluntly declared himself unimpressed with Klein 's abilities in that job : <P> P : And look , you 've just not got to let Klein ever set up a meeting again . He just does n't have his head screwed on . You know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eggs on his face . He 's just not our guy at all , is he ? <P> H:No <P> P : Absolutely , totally unorganized . <P> H : He 's a very nice guy . <P> P : People love him , but damn , is he unorganized . <P> P : . . . that 's why you ca n't have Klein ( unintelligible ) . He just does n't really have his head screwed on , Bob . . . <P> H : That 's right . <P> P : He just does n't know . He just sort of blubbers around . I do n't know how he does TV so well . <P> <P> ON HIS BOOK " SIX CRISES " <P> The President made repeated reference to his book throughout the day , lauding it and urging its lessons on his campaign aides : <P> P : I want you to reread it , and I want Colson to read it , and anybody else . <P> H : O.K. <P> P : And anybody else in the campaign . Get copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say I want them to read it and have it in mind . Give it to whoever you can , O.K. ? <P> H : Sure will . <P> P : Actually , the book reads awfully well . <P> P : . . . that Six Crises is a damned good book , and the ( unintelligible ) story reads like a novel-the Hiss case-Caracas was fascinating . The book 's treatment of the 1960 campaign , of course , for anybody in politics should be a must because it had a lot in there of how politicians are like . <P> <P> ON THE ARTS <P> In planning a campaign role for his daughters , Nixon grew wary :
