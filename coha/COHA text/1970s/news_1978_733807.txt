txt GAMES PEOPLE play in the office can deal you a devastating blow . It usually hits you at age 30 or so . Even though you have done all the right things , gone to the right schools , nailed down the right job , worked overtime without complaining , devoted yourself with unswerving loyalty to the improvement of your company 's performance , one day you suddenly realize that you are not receiving your just reward . In fact , the boss does n't know you 're alive . You 're " in " with the office " outgroup . " The lazy twerp at the next desk is getting promoted faster than you are . You arrive at meetings only to discover that the really important decisions were all made informally elsewhere . In short , there is a game going on here that they did not teach you in college . THE GAME is called office politics . People may sneer at it , laugh at it , or try to ignore it , but , one way or another , it affects just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Former journalist and college dean Marilyn Moats Kennedy ran across it a few years ago , and it has since become an obsession . At 35 , Kennedy heads Career Strategies , an Evanston consulting firm . She has been researching and teaching this eyebrow-raising subject for three years . Yes , office politics can be taught , she points out , and , to prove the point , a course that she devised will be taught at Northwestern University as a day-long seminar on Nov. 11 at the Chicago campus . It is listed in the course guide ? thanks to Kennedy 's own wry wit ? as " Office Politics : Where Are You , Machiavelli , When We Need You Most ? " " A great many people make the mistake of assuming that if they play dead , office politics will swirl around them with little or no damage to them personally , " Kennedy said . " THIS IS simply not the case . There is no way to avoid becoming involved ? unless you work alone in a deserted office in the dead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics // other person works with you there will be some byplay . Therefore , since you can not avoid the game , you might as well learn the game . " The noncredit course is part of Northwestern 's Continuing Education Division , aimed at working professionals , the group most likely to have tasted office politics firsthand , Kennedy says . In an eight-month study she completed early last year , more than 100 Chicagoarea professionals were asked to describe their biggest career problems . Every one identified political problems , not skills problems , Kennedy said . " Nobody said , ' I had a hard time le arning my job , ' " she recalled . " Everybody said , ' I had a hard time learning how to meet the expectations of my boss or ' I had a hard time identifying the unspoken values of the organization ' or ' I had a hard time figuring out how to get into the in-group and stay away from the out-group . " CONVERSELY , IN interviews with department heads and other bosses , she found their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hazy idea of what the boss was really looking for . " They 're working hard , " said one office chief , " but they 're not working smart ! " So how do you pull it off ? Apple polishing ? Bribery ? Marry the boss ' first-born ? There is nothing that drastic in the Kennedy remedy , but it is nevertheless calculated . Noting that " knowledge is power , " she says you must build an information network within the organization , develop a working definition of power within the office , identify the people who have " real power , " build a " team " and " support system , " and develop good internal public relations . Internal public relations ? " Anybody who waits for recognition is criminally naive , " she says bluntly . Instead , you should always let others know , through memos or the gossip grapevine , when you have completed a project Secretaries , trade shows , community newspapers , and public speaking engagements are all called into play by the ambitious office politician who wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A LOT of people forget that office gossip is 80 per cent accurate , " she said . " A good manager knows that you ca n't stop gossip , so you might as well use it to get your own information into the grapevine . " Every office politician needs a good " mentor , " a trusted counselor or ' friend . Kennedy isolates five types : " The ' information mentor ' tells you where the bodies are buried in the company . This person might be a secretary or a clerk . It does n't matter as long 3S they slip you helpful advice . " The ' godfather mentor ' makes things happen for you , as Dashiell Hammett did for Lillian Hellman . He will grant you favors , but of course , he can always come back in the future to collect the debt . " On your own level , the ' peer mentor ' ' help you out as long as you are not avipeting for the same things . : i .. " BUT GOOD relations with the ' com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hetryou , With ' a - differ- eat Ile* On . tiM . Column 1 organization . Competitive mentors may work for a competing firm , which often enables them to know what 's going on in your firm even before you do . " The ' retiree mentor ' is best . He has either retired or is close to it and , therefore , has little stake in the organization . He can tell you precisely how the top executives got there . " It has nothing to do with currying favor , Kennedy insists . If the boss likes to go out for an informal drink after work on Fridays and you beg off because you 're a teetotaler , then you just do n't understand how things work , she says . " Those informal get-togethers may be more important to you than the regular . ly scheduled conference-room skull session , " she said . KENNEDY IS particularly concerned about the problems women and members of minority groups have now that greater numbers than ever before find themselves trying to climb the corporate ladder . Next to prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naivete ? of office politics , particularly when it comes to being a " team player . " " Blacks and women have never had access to the inside information , " she said . " They have depended on self-reliance all their lives and have little reason to believe the office team will support them the same way it supports white men  --  who seem to take it for granted that they can cooperate and rely on each other . " Until you can demonstrate to your boss that you can delegate duties , you will not be promoted , Kennedy points out . Instead , you will be written off as lacking management ability . EVEN OFFICE furniture can be a political tool . " Many offices are installing cubicles , supposedly because they offer more privacy to the employes , " she said . " Actually , cubicles isolate people and make them easier to watch . In times of turmoil , you can easily see who is talking to whom . In an open office , you know when the boss is looking . With cubicles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you 're constantly on guard . Cubicles actually decrease privacy . " Most of the people who come to Kennedy for counseling or for seminars are 25 to 40 years old and are looking for ways to succeed where they work , or to change careers , she says . But occasionally she will see an upper management executive who wants to draw more efficiency from his employes . Before she founded Career Strategies , Kennedy  --  who holds two journalism degrees from Northwestern  --  learned office politics first-hand as a reporter for the Kansas City Star and later as an instructor and assistant dean at De Paul University . Her husband , Dan Kennedy , a personnel research director at Continental Bank , supports her career but , by mutual agreement , he does not supply her with material for her research , she says .
