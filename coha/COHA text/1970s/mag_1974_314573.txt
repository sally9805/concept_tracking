Japan 's genius for adapting foreign techniques is legendary , and the career of Tsuneo Inui , 64 , illustrates why . Sent to New York City by a Tokyo bank in the 1950s , Inui studied the leasing boom then taking off in the U.S. , and in 1964 paid $40,000 for advice and guidance from United States Leasing Corp . With that , and with loans from American banks ( Japanese banks then saw no future in leasing ) , he opened Orient Leasing Co. in Japan . The dry-witted Inui proved such an apt seito ( pupil ) that last year Orient became the biggest leasing company in the world , posting profits of $10.4 million , compared with $6.7 million earned by his old sensei ( teacher ) , U.S.L . <P> Inui , a lover of tradition ( he plays the classical three-string samisen ) , did his utmost to " Japanize " what he had learned . In particular , he worked through the sprawling sales networks of the great Japanese trading houses to lease to manufacturers , shippers and retailers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now Inui is trying to repay some of his debt of gratitude to U.S.L. , of which he became a director in 1973 . Next month Orient will open an office in Manhattan to help U.S.L . lease products to other Japanese firms operating in the U.S. - for a fee , of course .
