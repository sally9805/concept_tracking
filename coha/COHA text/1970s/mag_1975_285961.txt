Few U.S. companies have been hit harder by the recession than Chrysler Corp . Its losses have mounted-$94.1 million in the first quarter of 1975-and so has the pressure on its chairman , Lynn Townsend . Vacationing in Hawaii last month , Townsend decided that at 56 he had struggled with the problems of the nation 's third largest automaker long enough . Last week he turned over the wheel to his hand-picked successor , John Riccardo , 51 . <P> Like Townsend , Riccardo is a former accountant ( both came into Chrysler from the auditing firm of Touche Ross ) who has a reputation for being a cold-blooded cost cutter . Riccardo 's replacement as president will be Executive Vice President Eugene Cafiero , 49 , an affable , up-from-the-ranks production expert and the first member of Chrysler 's top management since the early 1950s with a strong automotive background . Both men have won high marks for their performance at Chrysler so far : directors took just six minutes last week to approve their promotions . <P> Tough Decisions . Townsend 's decision to retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by surprise . At a Detroit press conference he rejected any suggestion that creditors or directors had hastened his departure . Later he expounded to TIME Correspondent Edward J. Boyer on the pressures of " 14 stress-filled years " at the top : " I ca n't remember a day or week when I was n't making decisions that would have an impact on this entire company . I never remember a period of relaxation when I was n't concerned with some element of business . I do believe we ask more of an individual than we should when we ask him to bear the brunt of these decisions for an extended period of time . Ten years is long enough for a chairman or president . " He feels able to leave now , Townsend said , because Chrysler 's outlook is brightening , and the company should make a profit by the fourth quarter . <P> Even so , Riccardo and Cafiero face some tough decisions of their own if they are to make Chrysler consistently profitable . They will need to further revamp its product line , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of cash rebates . But the company has far less money than either GM or Ford to spend on developing new models . Its share of the new-car market has fallen to 15% now from 19% five years ago , mainly because , according to critics , Chrysler has paid too much attention to engineering and bookkeeping and not enough to figuring out what car buyers really want . " We 've been criticized for being dominated by financial guys who had little feel for the market , " acknowledges one Chrysler insider . By turning over the company to Riccardo and Cafiero now , he adds , Chrysler , will have " better balance at the top . "
