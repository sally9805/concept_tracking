txt What , in practical terms , can Arab and Communist opponents of the new Egypt-Israel accord actually do to block its implementation , or to halt further U.S. moves toward Mideast peace ? Part of the answer lies in how far Moscow decides to risk its detente with the United States by encouraging Arab action against Egyptian President Sadat and the United States , diplomatic analysts here believe . Since Palestinian , Libyan , Iraqi , and Algerian political opposition is already taken for granted , Syria 's future actions will provide most of the rest of the answer , these analysts add . Moscow 's boycott of the formal signing of the agreement in Geneva Thursday has already boosted the morale of the opponents of Mr. Sadat and the United States in the Arab world . Monitor correspondent Elizabeth Pond reports from Moscow : The Soviet boycott of the Geneva signing raises two major questions among diplomats here : What has happened to the Geneva conference ? And just how negative is the Soviet Union toward the interim settlement ? ( The Geneva conference , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mideast settlement , has received practically no mention in the Soviet press following this week 's Egyptian-Israeli agreement . I In the recent past the Soviet Union had given a tacit go-ahead to partial settlements as long as they would be brought under a Geneva umbrella . But the absence of any Soviet reference to Geneva this week , and the absence of the Soviet Union from the actual Geneva signing by Israel and Egypt , would seem to indicate lessened Soviet interest in this format // * What can foes of Sinai pact do ? // On the Egyptian-Israeli agreement itself , the Western-diplomatic consensus in Moscow seems to be that Soviet reaction is cautious .

Diplomats are waiting for more authoritative Soviet press commentary to judge the tone of Soviet reaction better . Assurances offered ? Top Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) sources in Beirut assert that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains assurances to it that the Soviet bloc will not cooperate in granting the Sinai accord the international recognition it needs in United Nations bodies . Following U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger 's short ' stop in Damascus Wednesday for a final briefing of Syrian President Assad on the accord , Syria 's ruling Baath ( Arab socialist ) party published Thursday a long statement totally rejecting it . For the first time since the October , 1973 , Arab-Israeli war , thousands . of Syrians demonstrated in Damascus streets . Damascus embassies of the United States and Egypt were heavily guarded Thursday . As . Israel escalated its attacks on the Palestinian presence in Lebanon with artillery shelling , air strikes , and a seaborne raid on a refugee camp near the port of Sidon. early Thursday , PLO leaders consulted in Damascus on how to step up their own military and . political efforts , and with the Syrian leaders on the joint political command President Assad proposed last March . Observers here believe the key to how far the Palestinians can go toward provoking new large-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadat.into breaking his " no war " pledge by coming to their defense , depends largely on President Assad .
