New trends and names keep the plots boiling <P> They are the insomniac 's solace , the commuter 's opiate , everymitty 's escape from idiot box and cuckoo 's nest . Novels of crime , mystery and suspense are by far the most widely read form of literature in most of the Western world , and not infrequently the best written . Asked some 35 years ago to name the worthiest American novelist , Andre Gide replied unhesitatingly : Dashiell Hammett . ( Because , said the author of The Immoralist , Hammett " never corrupted his art with morality . " ) Yet few contemporary critics treat the mystery as anything more substantial than a mental pacifier ; the genre is accorded scantier and less prominent review space in most journals than the mindless TV special or the memoirs of unmemorable statesmen . <P> No wonder , as the redoubtable crime writer Stanley Ellin ( The Luxembourg Run ) observes , that " there 's this mystery writers ' syndrome , the feeling that we 're really not top drawer . We 've never been mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word is that Graham Greene will never be considered for a Nobel because he 's cursed with the mystery stigma . " <P> It is a truism nonetheless that future historians may get their surest handle on today 's world by studying Martin Beck 's Stockholm , the Amsterdam of Van der Valk and Grijpstra , the England of Merle Capricorn and Adam Dalgliesh , Inspector Ghote 's Bombay , Jos Da Silva 's Rio , the Manhattan of Inspector Schmidt and Detective Steve Carella , Fred Fellows ' Connecticut , Sam Spade 's San Francisco and Travis McGee 's Florida . <P> At the weeklong Second International Congress of Crime Writers , sponsored by the Mystery Writers of America* and attended by some 300 practitioners in Manhattan last month , there were clues aplenty that the literature may be headed for better days-even , as Author Edward Hoch ( The Spy and the Thief ) suggested , for a new Golden Age comparable to the period of the ' 20s and ' 30s . Among other hopeful portents , an increasing number of colleges and high schools are offering courses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego extension has embarked on an ambitious program reprinting classics , and it is assisting with a thriller series for public television . A number of mystery bookshops are flourishing , from London 's Shepherd Market to Sherman Oaks in Los Angeles . Several small presses thrive on hard-cover editions . For example , the two-year-old Mysterious Press , founded by New York 's Author-Editor Otto Penzler ( The Great Detectives ) , has already published six new hard-cover titles , including Isaac Asimov 's ingenious Sherlockian Limericks . <P> Crime and mystery authors are as devoted to their roots as Alex Haley . Among the literary influences and progenitors they mostly soberly cite are the Old Testament , Sophocles , Shakespeare , Leibniz , Spinoza , Dostoyevsky , Dickens , Voltaire , Diderot , Hugo , Conan Doyle , Vidocq , Gaboriau , Twain , Poe , Wilkie Collins , Coleridge , Melville , R.L. Stevenson and Vachel Lindsay-not to mention the modernists from Maugham to Christie to Greene , Simenon to Deighton and Le Carr . Even Nabokov.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
