// " Big " like " very " and " some " rates as one of the most overused words in the American language ; yet when you think of the Old West Trail region of the United States , " big " is the word . And " big " does n't seem so hackneyed when you consider that the Old West Trail states of Montana , Nebraska , North Dakota , South Dakota and Wyoming comprise a geographical area larger than Europe . This is a country where locals will drive 200 miles " just to neighbor , " and it 's entirely possible to cover 400 miles a day easily in this low-traffic , endless horizon country and still take in the sights . If the land mass itself is huge , consider some of the attractions  --  Yellowstone National Park , Glacier National Park , Mount Rushmore , Grand Teton National Park , the Black Hills , Scotts Bluff National Monument , the Badlands of North and South Dakota , Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park . That , my friends , is a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big parks ... big mountains ... big rivers ... big lakes and reservoirs . Cowboys and Indians are big in this part of the country . Rodeo is the Old West Trail 's own particular heritage , and there 's a rodeo every day ( and nearly every night ) somewhere in the Old West Trail during the summer . Scores of Indian reservations , any of which are gearing up to handle tourists , dot the entire region . Crow , Cheyenne , Sioux , Shoshone , Arapaho , Blackfoot  --  just some of the proud names in the Northern Plains Indian heritage . The big , wide Missouri River actually brought the first " tourist " into this area . The fur traders used it first , but it was Lewis and Clark who opened the Missouri as the great river highway to the West . The Missouri is tame today , but once the Sioux had a legend that a giant red buffalo rampaged up the river in the spring , cracking the ice with his hump and loosing the violent torrent . Now , six of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain of placid , blue-water lakes , offering superlative fishing and other water sports . Big are the heroes of the Old West Trail country . Buffalo Bill Cody , Red Cloud , Wild Bill Hickok , Theodore Roosevelt , Crazy Horse , Jim Bridger , Calamity Jane , Sitting Bull , General George Custer , Chief Joseph and a whole host of tall heroes , pretty heroines and bad hombres are the stuff of which legends are made . Nothing much has changed in the people 's attitudes toward their chosen part of the world . Buffalo Bill , et al , accepted the West for what it was  --  rugged , testing , beautiful , fulfilling , uncompromising . Residents today still believe that . Noted author Neil Morgan in his book The Westward Tilt described two of the states ( Montana and Wyoming ) : " The Mountain North still belongs to God . Its population is thin , and when one does not see a human being for a good many miles , the human seems more important . Values count more than they do where people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will not change in the Mountain North , not for a long time . " The welcome is big in Old West Trail country , where the people are proud of their country , their heritage , one another , and only too anxious to share it with a visitor . The following journey through the five states is one man 's choice . To attempt to list all the attractions , both real and manmade , would border on the ludicrous . MONTANA At the start of this article , I suggested that certain adjectives and adverbs had been overused to the point of becoming meaningless . Comes now the case where adjectives fail to do justice in any form . Glacier National Park in northwest Montana is a natural wonder defying description . This near-vertical chunk of 1,600 square miles of awesome beauty harbors 60 glaciers , 57 species of mammals , 210 species of birds , more than 1,100 different native flowers and 1,000 miles of hiking trails . Add to this 200 crystal lakes and 240 miles of roads and you get an idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has escaped the attention of most attention-givers , i.e. , travel writers , television travelogues , largely because its more famous sisters , Yellowstone , Grand Canyon , Yosemite , have grabbed off the headlines . ( All the better to enjoy a truly remarkable park . ) Smell the park 's fragrances , touch and listen . A requisite for Glacier is time . A single day wo n't do . Plan at least three days , and even then , you 'll discover it is n't enough . Glacier opens its seasonal doors from May 15 to September 15 . It is well served by excellent roads , planes , trains and buses . Two daily Amtrak trains serve the park at East and West Glacier-Airline and bus schedules , too , make for easy entry . Lake McDonald on the west side of Glacier and Glacier Park Lodge on the east are two prime jumping off points for inner-park exploration . Glacier Park , Inc. , offers twelve different scenic tours of the park by motor coach . Trips last from two to five days and include meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister park , Waterton Lakes National Park , just across the border into Canada . Many of the package tours include launch cruises on Glacier 's lakes  --  McDonald , St. Mary , Two Medicine , Swiftcurrent and Josephine among them . Excursion boats are manned by knowledgeable skippers , and some voyages are accompanied by National Park Service personnel , naturalists who provide that insight that can " make " a trip . Or you can go it alone . Both canoe and power craft are available . If you can tear yourself away from the scenery , throw out your line . No fishing license is required within the park . Perhaps the most satisfying way of all to explore Glacier National Park is by hiking . Strap on a comfortable pair of hiking boots , slip the pack on the back , and stride off . Experienced hikers can pack into hotels reachable only by trail  --  Sperry and Granite Park Chalets . Or you can make arrangement to reach the chalets by horseback . Novice hikers will probably want to confine their ventures to short outings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain goat , is everywhere . And there 's always the scenery . NEBRASKA Indians called it the Big Medicine Trail . To the white man , it was the Overland , the Oregon and Mormon Trails and the route of the Pony Express  --  but to a growing nation , it was known as the Platte River Road . The first transcontinental railroad followed its course and later the first transcontinental highway ( U.S. 30 ) . Interstate 80 follows the same historic route , and that 's the route we 're going to take . The " winning of the West " unfolds all along the Platte River Road across Nebraska . The Joslyn Art Museum ( featuring a treasure chest of Western art ) and the Union Pacific Historical Museum in Omaha , the State Historical Society Museum in Lincoln , the Stuhr Museum of the Prairie Pioneer at Grand Island and the famed Harold Warp Pioneer Village at Minden all offer fascinating insight into the great Western adventure . In fact , history has a special meaning to the Cornhuskers . The state boasts more than 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nebraskans have preserved and guarded their colorful heritage with a dedicated passion , and they take great pleasure in sharing it with others . A special delight along the Platte River Road ( 1-80 ) is the original Pony Express Station at Gothenburg in central Nebraska . The Pony Express : What other means of communications was so short-lived , yet had a more profound effect on the development of the West ? Launched on April 3 , 1860 , to the accompaniment of celebrations at both ends of the line  --  Sacramento , California , and St. Joseph , Missouri  --  the Express generally followed the route of the Oregon and California Trails . Stations of log , stone or adobe were built at intervals of about 15 miles . Gothenburg is such a station . Riders each covered 75 to 100 miles , and the entire trip usually took about ten days . The Pony Express lasted until October 24 , 1861 , less than two years . Although a financial disaster , the Pony Express was a success for a growing nation  --  it demonstrated the practicability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it blazed the path of the first transcontinental railroad and it helped tie California to the Union cause in the early difficult months of the Civil War . The Pony Express was one of the great acts in the drama of the West . // The Gothenburg Station is open to the public and the hours are 7:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m . June through August and 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. in May ' and September . You can still mail a letter from the station . Not far are two important landmarks on the old Oregon-California-Mormon Trails  --  Chimney Rock National Historic Site near Bayard and Scotts Bluff National Monument near Gering . The story of these critical pioneer guidons is told in the Oregon Trail Museum at Scotts Bluff National Monument . ( The museum is free and the summit drive $1 . ) From high atop Scotts Bluff , you can see far-distant Laramie Peak , in Wyoming , the next important guidon on the trek West . NORTH DAKOTA " I like this land because it gives me room to turn around without stepping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolation to the Badlands . " " I always said I never would have been president if it had not been for my experience in North Dakota . " The first of these two remarks about North Dakota 's Badlands was made by the Marquis de Mores , an ambitious Frenchman who arrived with grandiose plans to set up a cattle empire , raise and market beef . He named his town after his wife , Medora , a member of the Van Hoffman family of New York . The second observation was made by Theodore Roosevelt after he became President of the United States in 1916 . Roosevelt came to the Badlands when he was twenty-three years old to hunt buffalo and wild game , and ultimately pur chased a large ranch before he returned to New York to enter the political wars . Medora did n't enter into a deep , seventy-year sleep during the years after Roosevelt and de Mores . Somebody forgot to tell the local cowboys that raising hell on Saturday night was a no-no . For many years , Medora simply remained undiscovered . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved buttes and gully-ridden valleys of the Badlands attracted national attention . After years of effort by various local , state and national officials , the Theodore Roosevelt National Park was established in 1947 . The North Dakota State Historical Society operates the Ch  --  teau de Mores , a gift from the de Mores family . A history-minded Bismarck businessman , Harold Schafer , activated his long interest in Medora in 1963 when he purchased the Rough Riders Hotel . Restored by Schafer and the Gold Seal Company , the hotel is a landmark of the past , reminiscent of a bygone era . Good food , too . " There was too much here to be lost , too many important elements of America 's early frontier history to be allowed to decay , " Schafer says . Other development of tourist facilities by Gold Seal and smaller enterprises followed . Schafer opened a museum ( the Fur Trader and Wildlife Museum ) , several restaurants , the Badlands Saloon , the Joe Ferris Store , a candle shop , an old-fashioned ice cream parlor , a 120-unit luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purebred quarter horse , you can ride through the valleys and high up to the butte tops of this rough-hewn terrain . The Badlands have an unmistakable quality , and artists , historians and " just folks " from around the world come to grab the intangibles . And here 's a way to end a great day at Medora  --  see the " Medora Musical " in the Gold Seal Amiptheatre , nestled between buttes of the Badlands . The musical plays nightly in July and August . Medora is 133 miles west of the capital city , Bismarck , the nearest commercial air terminal and Amtrak station . ( Bismarck is served by three airlines and has every-otherday Amtrak service . Rental cars are available at Bismarck . ) SOUTH DAKOTA For boisterous sin , a chance to get rich quickly  --  or die just as suddenly  --  few places have ever rivaled the town of Deadwood , South Dakota , either in fact or legend . Deadwood is ninety-eight years old now and still going strong . It is n't the roaring , hell-forleather gold town it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The town , climbing the sides of a narrow gulch in South Dakota 's famed Black Hills , has kept the atmosphere and looks of a frontier boom town in the midst of the twentieth century . The present age has left its mark . There are chain stores and neon lights , but the streets are still narrow ( an understatement ) and the storefronts are those built when the Deadwood gold strike was the biggest news in America . Gold miners from the nearby Homestake Mine still stroll the streets , along with loggers from the hills and cowboys from the range country , and they ( rather than the college students , tourists or local businessmen ) give Deadwood its indelible character . It 's a delight to sit on the porch of the Franklin Hotel and " people watch . " Deadwood is fiercely proud of its raucous past . The Number Ten Saloon has sawdust on the floor and enough memorabilia of the Wild Bill Hickok-Calamity Jane days to rate as a small museum . Every night except Sunday through the summer , the townspeople stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if you close your eyes for a brief moment , Wild Bill , Calamity , et al , suddenly are there . Deadwood 's " Days of ' 76 " celebration and rodeo the first weekend in August is a joyful , sleepless three-day shootout full of rodeos , parades and festivity . Gold made ( and almost broke ) Deadwood . In 1874 Lt. Col. George A. Custer led an expedition into the southern Black Hills and discovered gold . The first rush came in what is now the town of Custer . By late fall of 1874 , some 7,000 miners had crowded into Custer . Then a prospector brought news of a new , richer strike in the northern hills , in a gulch area recently burned over by fire ( hence , the " deadwood " name ) . By the spring of 1876 , there were fewer than 100 miners left in Custer and more than 25,000 jammed into every nook and cranny of Deadwood Gulch . Other gold and silver strikes made the northern hills " the richest hundred square miles on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters of every description . In Mt . Moriah Cemetery , high above Deadwood , lie Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane  --  side by side  --  and Preacher Smith and Potato Creek Johnny are nearby . The flag at the cemetery flies day and night ; Deadwood is one of eight places in the United States permitted to fly the flag twenty-four hours a day . Rapid City is the transportation center for the Black Hills . Three airlines serve the area , and rental cars are available at the airport and downtown . Several tour companies operate tours throughout the Black Hills area . Amtrak does not serve South Dakota , however . WYOMING The very name Cody , Wyoming , conjures visions of William F. " Buffalo Bill " Cody  --  army scout , Indian fighter , buffalo hunter and Wild West showman . And well it should , for it was Colonel Cody who founded this small western town at the mouth of Shoshone Canyon , the eastern gateway to Yellowstone National Park some fifty miles to the west . The memory of the old Indian fighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he built to house the workers who were building his town . ( Today , a Holiday Inn sits smack in the middle of the village . ) You can ride a horse , visit a museum , swim , see a melodrama , eat a chuckwagon dinner , make arrangements for a whitewater float trip , play tennis , sip a sarsaparilla or stroll a boardwalk . Or enjoy yourself at the downtown Irma Hotel , which Buffalo Bill built and named for his daughter . The old back bar is still there , and the spirit of the Colonel pervades every inch of the old hotel . " Belly up " to the bar and have a brew . You may find yourself standing next to Western artist Harry Jackson . I did once . Nowhere is Buffalo Bill 's memory more pervasive than at the end of Sheridan Avenue , where the Buffalo Bill Historical Center dominates the scene . The New York Times has called this place " a magnificent documentation of pure West . There has never been a more comprehensive exhibit of Americana anywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex will come away highly impressed after viewing the original paintings and sculptures of the giants among Western artists . The Buffalo Bill Historical Center houses three of the finest museums of their kind anywhere  --  the Whitney Gallery of Western Art , the Buffalo Bill Museum and the Plains Indian Museum . Constructed of native stone , the center sits before the breathtaking backdrop of the Absaroka Mountain . The heroic statue , Buffalo Bill , the Scout , stands at the north end of the complex . The Whitney Gallery of Western Art houses roughly $3 million worth of Western American art -- accurate portrayals of life in the Old West , by the foremost artists of the period . Its exhibits are known as documentary art  --  realistic pictorial records of the western scene before photography . The exhibits in the Whitney reflect the best work of these documentary artists : Charles M. Russell , Frederic Remington , Albert Bierstadt , Edgar Paxson , George Catlin , Alfred Jacob Miller and many others . The collection of Russell 's paintings and sculptures is one of the largest and most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out is the renowned Frederic Remington . The Whitney collection includes three copies of his famous Corning Through the Rye sculpture , as well as the entire contents of his studio at the time of his death in 1909 . A painting that deserves special mention is Edgar Paxson 's Custer 's Last Stand . This haunting recollection of that fateful June day in Montana is credited by most historians with being the most accurate depiction of the Battle of the Little Bighorn . The Buffalo Bill Historical Center is open daily from May 1 to October 1 . Admission for adults is $1.50 and for children over six 50 cents . Cody is n't all Buffalo Bill , however . Rodeo buffs can enjoy the nightly ( except Sunday ) Cody Night Rodeo from mid-June to late August and the Cody Stampede over the Fourth of July . A visit to the Mormon Grigware Mural in the Latter-Day Saints Church offers a few inspiring moments , and Old Trail Town is a collection of historical buildings and relics of the frontier past . Cody is served daily by Frontier Airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nearest Amtrak service is in Billings , Montana , 100 miles northwest . 2
