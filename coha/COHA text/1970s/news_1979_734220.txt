txt Federal officials investigating the crash of an American Airlines jumbo jet in Chicago Friday focused their attention yesterday on the plane 's loss of an engine and engine mount , which fell to the ground on takeoff , and on the almost simultaneous cutoff of a device that records cockpit ' conversation . A bolt and a nut resembling those used to attach the or Pylori , to the Underside of chewing were found near the boarding gate from ' Which the plane had taxied out before its final takeoff and crash .. All 271 persons believed to be aboard the three-engine Douglas DC-10 and two persons on the ground were killed in the disaster at O'Hare ' International Airport . It was the highest death toll in an air accident in this country . Details of the plane 's last moments were made public last night at the command post near the scene by Elwood T. Driver , vice chairman of the-National Transportation Safety Board , which is in charge of the inquiry . .. looking for Possible Match Officials said the markings on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . bolt hole , of six : holes used for such connections , that had been located in the debris . But it was still possible that it would fit one of the other five . ' ? " The ' matter is still under investigation , " Mr. Driver said . The safety board official also said that some but not all of the witnesses who saw the engine and its mount fly off the wing thought they ' had flipped over the top of the wing . Although the engine-pylon combination hangs below and juts forward of the wing , it is designed to fly over the top if it comes off in flight to avoid hitting the wing . . . However , at the relatively ' slow speed of a takeoff , it was thought possible that it might hit the wing and cause serious damage . Others suggested that fatal &Magi; might have been caused to wing INQUIRY INTO CRASH FOCUSES ON ENGINE // or tail surfaces , whether the trajectory was above or below the wing .

Then Silence Examination of the crash-resistant cockpit recorder in a Washington laboratory late yesterday showed that the device stopped recording just about the time the plane 's nose-wheel lifted off the runway . and the engine flew off the left wing . The last thing on the tape was a single word : " Damn . " Everything before that was routine , the technical ' exchanges of any takeoff , according to James King , head of the National Transportation Safety Board , which is in charge of the inquiry . Earlier yesterday , Mr. Driver said in Chicago : " As best I have been able to determine , the plane shpuld have been able to fly with two engines . But we do n't want to speculate and are making no conclusiOns at this time . " The inquiry team was focusing considerable attention on two related issues : What damage did the loss of the engine do to the basic structure of the left wing and its control systems ?

While the voice recorder abruptly stopped when the left engine tore away , a companion crash-resistant recorder that keeps track of aircraft and engine performance continued - to function for another 30 seconds . But it too.went dead be fore the final impact , raising questions about the functioning of the electrical system and what pattern of failure led to the catastrophe . A pilot with considerable time in DC10 's said both recorders were designed to operate from independent battery power if the engine-driven generators providing the plane 's main electrical power failed . Six teams of specialists set up by the National Transportation Safety Board began combing through the smoldering wreckage of the DC-10 in a search for clues . There still has been no official count of the dead although the number is believed to include 258 passengers , 13 crew mem bers and two men found dead near a truck at the crash site . The authorities said identification of the victims would be difficult because most were burned beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . who died on the ground was found underneath the truck and the other in a position suggesting he may have been trying to , get out of the truck , according to Richard J. Elrod , the ? Cook County Sheriff . This , he said , raised the possibility that the two men , believed to have been working in the area , ' may have tried to take cover . The plane , American 's Flight 191 bound for Los Angeles with Memorial Day weekend travelers , had just lifted off Runway 32R when the left engine abruptly tore away . The huge craft , witnesses said , rolled toward the left , wobbled as though it was losing safe flying speed , and fmally dove into the abandoned Ravenswood Airport , just missing a mobile home court . Effectiveness of Controls It was the consensus of safety experts that the loss of the engine and pylon from the left wing should not have caused the crew to lose control of the big jet , The plane is designed so it can readily be flown with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the engine loss occurred , as it did Friday , just as the plane was lifting off the runway and had only a little more than the minimum speed necessary to remain in the air . Mr. Driver stressed , though , that at low speed the effectiveness of ailerons ; spoilers and other flight controls would be " at a minimum . " Still , the dominant view of the specialists was that the crew should have been able to keep the plane in the air even though the left engine fell off . They reasoned , therefore , that the engine probably darhaged another area of the plane as it tore from the wing . That damage , it was believed , could well have prevented the crew from stopping the roll to the left , maintaining a safe flying speed , and circling the airport to make an emergency landing . There was some confusion about exactly which runway the , plane had taken off from . The reason for the confusion was that the runway is marked differently at both ends .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
