Chile 's military junta , which quickly overthrew the late Marxist President Salvador Allende in a bloody September coup , is struggling now with an infinitely tougher task : righting an economy that three years of maladroit socialistic experiments left in a shambles . When the generals grabbed power , inflation was roaring out of control ; farm , factory and mine production were scraping bottom ; Chile 's banking and financial system had all but collapsed . <P> By last week the generals were swinging the economy toward a rigidly conservative course . To carry out its program , the junta has appointed three right-leaning foes of Allende : Raul Saez , who was made special adviser for overall economic planning ; Fernando Leniz , who became Economics Minister ; and Orlando Saenz , adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . <P> Saez , 60 , is an engineer turned economic consultant who has a reputation for hard work and cold-blooded toughness . Leniz , 46 , a feline figure who was publisher of El Mercuric , a conservative Santiago newspaper , is a shrewd businessman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a former director of a private economic-development group . " Chile , " he says , " will have to sacrifice to save itself . " <P> Though Saenz has given the highest priority to reopening Chile to foreign investors-he held at least 120 meetings with businessmen during recent visits to the U.S. and Canada-he stresses that the government will maintain tight control of its industry . Copper is , of course , Chile 's chief source of foreign income . Under Allende 's highly political management of the mines , which he seized from such U.S. firms as Kennecott and Anaconda , disastrous strikes badly hurt production . The government will continue to own the mines , but it is willing to negotiate at least partial restitution to the U.S. firms and invite them to return to help operate the mines or develop new ones , perhaps as minority owners . Says Saenz : " We will do anything necessary to have first-class advice on copper . " The junta also aims to attract new industry , for example electronics producers . <P> Painful Eating . Chileans are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allende regime had forced industry to hire unneeded workers ; many of them have been fired , adding to Chile 's high jobless rate . To blunt the inflationary impact of the artificially swollen money supply-Allende had simply printed more and more currency-the new government devalued the escudo by 58% . That action severely chopped into the buying power of all but the wealthiest consumers . In addition , the junta has largely scrapped Allende 's heavyhanded controls on prices , which were kept so low in relation to costs that farmers and businessmen let production plummet for lack of a profit incentive . <P> Now production is again growing , but retail prices are soaring . In one month , the prices of poultry and bread have rocketed about 175% , beef more than 200% ; most wages and salaries have been allowed to rise " only " 100% . Indeed , food purchases are estimated to eat up a painful 80% of the incomes of poorer Chileans.
