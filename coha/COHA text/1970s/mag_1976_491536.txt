R Post interview with JOHN WAYNE : IMAGE VS . MAN Meet the real " Duke " as he sounds off on the media , Ronald Reagan , acting , ranching , ecology , and reveals his new process for recycling old tires into new fuel . Text and Photography by David Sutton Trying to keep up with John Wayne is like trying to thread a needle while jumping on a pogo stick . I know . I have worked with him and photographed him in connection with a dozen or so films in the last ten years . We are friends  --  I 've discussed many a project with him , asked many a favor of him , had many arguments with him ( dangerous , man ! ) and faced him across a chessboard literally hundreds of times . Wayne is a ferocious and resourceful player and wins most of the time , which he enjoys with gargantuan relish . These skirmishes are an interesting exercise in discovering , almost feeling , the thrust of another man 's mind , imagination and emotions . Yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality , quite different from the familiar clean-cut , taciturn tower of strength which is his actor-image . This is part of him , of course , in a certain sense , since he is largely playing himself in most of his parts . But there is much , much more . The public image and innumerable articles about " Duke " Wayne have n't yet succeeded in getting the real man out into the open . His craggy and heroic profile , apparently chiseled from some indestructible native granite , is known all over the world . He is without doubt the most popular actor of our time . Young girls overlook the fact that he is old enough to be their grandfather and swoon over his photograph . There are automobile bumper stickers proclaiming " God Bless John Wayne . " Yet amid so much adulation he has been repeatedly ridiculed , belittled and maligned by the news media . I have seen many reporters breezing in and out of his dressing room or visiting at his home in Newport Beach , California . Brief chitchats have lasted no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour there " There 's a tendency , seemingly , to have me drop my G 's and to quote me in poor English on every occasion . I do n't mind that . . I know how well educated I am and I also know how stupid I am , so anything they might do to set the picture does n't bother my ego . " over a period of a day or two for the purpose of obtaining a so-called in-depth article . The end result has often been a complete distortion of the truth . Have we a mystery here ? Not really . Just a few facts about a fascinating man which need a little rearranging . Yes , he can ride like a centaur . Since the days when he played football for the University of Southern California , his alma mater , he has been so physically impressive  --  six feet , four inches and 230 pounds  --  that there is a tendency to overlook his intellectual qualities . He has a delicious sense of humor . He is erudite and well read . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credibility . John Wayne ? Right . The best way , I decided , to reveal such a complex and sometimes misunderstood individual is to let him speak for himself as much as possible . These are but a few personal reflections about a man I have come to know not only as an exciting subject before my cameras but also as a friend I could always turn to when I needed help or advice . I thought of these things and many more as I drove toward his home in Newport Beach , south of Los Angeles . As I entered the Wayne residence , Duke was seated at a table in an alcove of asmall study just off his living room . A large pile of mail was stacked before him and he was obviously engrossed in making his replies . I set up my tape recorder and did a testing ... one ... two ... three  --  as a ruse to attract his attention ; it did . In mock innocence he said , " That 's the damnedest camera I have ever seen  --  I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " I replied . " I 'm here to get an interview . I 'm using a tape recorder so I wo n't miss any of your mellifluous tones . Are you ready ? " " I was born ready , " he said . " Let 's have at it . " Next July 4 commemorates our 200th birthday as a nation . How do you feel about it ? It 's a bicentennial year and I 'm an American . I do n't think that I 'm any more patriotic than the average fellow who does n't write for the newspapers . Since you mention the newspapers , I 've sat in on more than a few interviews about you and have seen what was written afterward . For example , many writers have you dropping your g 's . Yet , you really do n't speak that way . How do you feel about it ? Well , on occasions ... you know  --  kiddingly , I have used sensationally bad English  --  but I 've clone it to exaggerate a point . Yet , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my g 's and to quote me in poor English on every occasion . I think that if they would go through the letters I have written  --  I write thirty or forty letters a day when I 'm not on a picture  --  I do n't think they will find the type of English they try to put in my mouth . I do n't mind that . It 's not irritating to me . I know how well educated I am and I also know how stupid I am , so anything they might do to set the picture does n't bother my ego . That is n't the image that bothers me ! The image is that Interlandi cartoon  --  it was just here  --  Pat , what did you do with that cartoon ? Duke 's secretary , Pat Stacy , comes into the room and hands him a political cartoon which had appeared in the Los Angeles Times . Here this Interlandi fellow , who is a paid political cartoonist , draws a picture of me playing the part of Rooster Cogburn , changes the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth that are pompous , opinionated and certainly not my attitude on life . I studied the cartoon carefully . The squared-off face featured the facial contours of President Ford  --  replete with eye patch similar to the character John Wayne had portrayed in True Grit , for which he won an Academy Award , and the more recently released Rooster Cog-burn . The cartoon was a play on both words and likenesses , and obviously Duke was disturbed about it . It is an insinuating cartoon . It seems to be the image that the intellectual anti-culturists want to establish about me , painting me as a caricature of a heavy in a Gene Autry Western . Of course , my movie image actually is of a fellow who  --  regardless of the color of his hat  --  has white shining through its brim . I like to think of myself as the patriarch and baron of all the domain I survey and the champion of the underdog . Somewhere in between is the character that I am . A man 's character and personality are made up by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one thing in reel life , and of probably every dramatic experience that a human being could have in real life . Somewhere in between there lies John Wayne or stands John Wayne . I seldom lie . I just ca n't understand why he thinks a statement from me on the political scene might hurt whatever it is he likes  --  and he does this to set me up . I do n't like politics and I do n't try to be part of the scene , yet I 'm sometimes forced into it as this idiot is forcing me with his pun-filled cartoon . He paused for a moment , picked it up and read it verbatim . " My name is Rooster Cogford , rugged individualism is my game , I ai n't gon na give New York City any money . Shoot  --  let them stand on their own two feet . Who do they think they are  --  Lockheed or something ? " None of those ideas are my own ideas , and this is directly alluding to my personality . Would n't you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have interviewed you ? Well , I 'll tell you what they do . They come with a set impression of what you are ; they then ask you a question . If they do n't get the answer they wish the first time , they continue asking the same question over and over and over  --  they jump from one to another and back to it until they get you irritated enough or until you say something , trying to be humorous , that will coincide with the picture that they wish to paint of you . And that 's the way they work . There are very few open-minded interviewers who come into your home prepared to accept what you are . " It should be pointed out that newsmen and television people are no longer in the business of just reporting news  --  they are selling their wares in the marketplace . Consequently , they are looking for the provocative things to say that attract a greater number of listeners and viewers in order that sponsors may sell a greater number of trucks , Toyotas , and toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from reading their cronies ' articles as to the type of personality that you are . I seem to recall one writer we were working together on a film about fiue years ago who came armed for the attack , but you charmed him so much that in the finished piece the interview ended : " There he stood in the sun , a , big hulk of a man  --  I had finally met John Wayne . " He ended on a pleasant note . The diatribes were minimal for a change . Well , actually I do remember that article . He did turn the interview around and make humor out of his own preconceived notions of the type of person I am ... which I thought was pleasant . It seldom happens that way , and so it was quite obviously a compliment and I appreciated it . You do not fault objective reporting ? Well , the way the majority of them show their objectivity  --  in a scene , if John Wayne rides down a street with . Ann-Margret , their objective reporting will read something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rather heavy paunch is riding down the street with Ann-Margret . " The objective thing only goes as far as I 'm concerned . At least they could say  --  with the beautiful Ann-Margret  --  but that 's not the way it would be written . That 's interesting but the paunch , the balding and your being old . Nonetheless , you are actively engaged in the motion picture business day in and day out . That 's true . I want to get on a picture as quickly as I can because that 's the only time I really have any definite pattern  --  when I 'm on a regular and sane daily program . I 've made it a practice when I 'm on a picture to devote all my energies to the part I am portraying and to try to avoid outside and public engagements . When I finish my work for the day all I have to do is go home , get out of my clothing , have a shower , get some hot food and think of the next day 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasion for benefits and causes  --  despite the heavy daily schedule a film he is working on might call for . I was about to ask him another question when the phone buzzed . It was a call from his agent , Jack Gordean . They talked for about five minutes concerning the merits of a few scripts that had been submitted . I thought of the next picture he is preparing called The Shootist . I asked him about the story line . Well , it 's a kind of type casting , a gunman who is dying of cancer at the turn of the century . Since I belong to the very exclusive club of fellows who have recovered from cancer , I have an understanding of the part . But the real value of the story is in the attitude of the supporting prototypes  --  the baker , the mortician , the businessmen , the different individuals in a community . These characters are well detailed in the story . We have humor , we have pathos , a dramatic appeal which I feel will make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make all the characters believable enough for the majority of moviegoers to identify with . In the story I 'm laid up in a boardinghouse and attended by a doctor . Some top young gunmen hear about it , want to make a name for themselves , and come into the town . In portraying an aging and dying gunfighter I try to show a young fellow , who might have turned out wild , that it 's not worth it . That 's the basic idea of the story so there is also a bit of moral value to it . It 's about a fellow who has a little more good than bad in him . That 's Confinuod on page 117 continued from page 117 we grow grain-17,000 acres in Stanfield , Arizona  --  irrigated acres . I have a feedlot which my partner , Louis Johnson , and I are running . It 's really a monstrous-sized project  --  we have about 80,000 head in the feedlot at the moment , aided by a computerized mill and specialists to help us with the diets and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain amount of my time even though my partner is the one responsible and in charge . We also have a purebred Hereford setup . Just last week I returned from our annual bull sale which luckily was successful  --  probably the most successful Hereford affair of the year . I understand that you have become quite involved in things of an ecological nature . Yes , I 've become very interested in ecological problems and , like any other citizen , I 'm also concerned with the fact that we face a severe oil shortage . In that regard , I have a longtime friend , Bill Chambers , an inventor who is working on a liquefaction and gasification process . We formed a company called DECO , whose initials stand for Duke Engineering Company . There are three partners , Bill Chambers , George Lavonis and myself . First we started with oil shale , then it developed into testing for coal and finally tires  --  old tires . We reclaim and process old tires which yield a really top petrochemical oil , plus a gas which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlets to the sewers , and no pipes freeing any gas into the air  --  so there are no pollution problems in our own operation . It 's so simple that it is taking a while for people to realize that this system is a fact and can be made into a very commercial project . We have been so busy in development and research that we have n't really tried any promotional activities . Is the process in fact a specific working proposition ? It is definitely out of the test-tube stage . We do not have a commercial-sized plant , but we have a plant that will handle ten tons of tires a day . To be commercial we need probably one hundred tons of tires a day , two fifty-ton plants so that if anything went wrong with one the other could remain in operation . Shredding equipment will take care of more than a hundred tons a day , so that two fifty-ton plants would be very practical and very remunerative . More important  --  it would provide oil and energy . Since the DECO process not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubbish wastes as well and since your process will meet a twofold purpose , what do you think the acceptance factor will be ? There is so much hysteria in this country about ecology that I feel this will at least calm down The Sierra Club and The Friends of the Earth . As I said , we have no pipes freeing any gas into the air nor anyoutlets pouring pollutants into sewage disposal units . What I 'm trying to say is that what all these so-called do-gooders are telling us do n't do  --  we do n't do . And Bill Chambers , George Lavonis and I want to be in a can-do operation . And we have it . Earlier in the day I had talked with Wayne 's thirteen-year-old son , Ethan . I wanted to know how he felt about some of the things that have been said about his father ... " I did n't know until recently the kinds of things they have been saying about my dad in papers and magazines . The ones that do n't know him sure irritate me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . You should see how gentle he is when he wakes up my little sister and me . " I guess what Ethan means is that his dad is not the insensitive , opinionated oaf that some writers who think they know his political feelings would have you believe . J Let 's bring to mind a piece that appeared in Playboy several years ago in which the interview ended or the tape ran out before you had a chance to qualify some of your statements . Would you comment on that ? I did n't say anything in the article that would in any way take the human dignity away from any individual . I did make a joke when they asked me if I though ( the Indians should have Alcatraz. said why not , no one who has ever been there wants to go back ... not even the guards . I said that maybe we should sell it to them for what we paid for New York  --  and I hope they 've saved their wampum . It was all said in pleasant humor , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I was belittling them . The American Indian Movement took umbrage at that and I think that before A.I.M . took aim at me they should havechecked more thoroughly to find out how careful I have always been in my pictures to make sure that none of them lost their human dignity . In fact , a few years ago while we were filming in the Seattle area I attended a premiere of Cahill which was also the occasion for the appearance of a group of protest marchers . In the film my closest friend was an Indian  --  and he was shown in a very warm light . How about the political scene of the moment ? I have vowed that I would try to stay out of it at this time . I feel that certain newsmen , not of my political segment , have established me as such a provocative character that might not be of much value to anyone for whom I vouch . If I become too involved I just do n't think that it would be helpful to my choice . I do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although I do n't think that the country wil fold up if he is defeated by Gerald Ford . I think it is magnificent that Reagan has made the statement that there should be a campaign in which no disparaging things are tossed back and forth among the proposed candidates . I feel that Ronald Reagan did a fine job for California . The liberal group has repeatedly said that he did n't . They forget that it was a bankrupt state when he took office , and that when he left there was a fund in excess of what the budget needed for his administration . He also attempted to give the people something to combat greedy and ambitious politicians who might in the future give away an even larger percentage of our money to special interests and unnecessary bureaucracy . What was your reaction when you heard that Reagan had announced his plans to run for the presidency ? When I heard that Ronnie had finally decided to toss his hat in the ring , I sent him a telegram in which I said : God Bless You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leadership Of Your Stature In This Country . I feel that Ronald Reagan would make a fine president . Whether or not the Eastern Establishment will allow such a thing to come to pass , I do n't know . I would like to think of America and what America means to all of us . I 'm certainly not , azirsvmed to be patriotic about the fact that we will be celebrating the 200th birthday of our country . I agree with you , Dave , and I think that the average American also feels that way . I think that the same can be said of our younger generation . The average young man or woman or child of today is quite a bit ahead of our generation because of the technology and improved communications which have made them so much more knowledgeable . That brings up a possible danger which leadership in the news media and television must watch out for . It can greatly affect the atittude of impressionable young minds , and 1 further think that not only should the media watch their behavior , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes , guidelines which would not preclude their right to free speech . It should be pointed out that newsmen and television people are no longer just in the business of reporting news  --  they are selling their wares in the marketplace . Consequently , they are looking for the provocative things to say that attract a greater number of listeners and viewers in order that sponsors may sell a greater number of trucks , Toyotas and toilet paper . Which is the racket they are now in. * * * The interview drew to a close , and I paused only to make mention of some of his luggage piled near the front door . I asked him where he was headed this time . " I 'm going to take a bit of a vacation aboard The Wild Goose " ( a luxuriously appointed converted minesweeper which he keeps in the harbor at Newport Beach ) . " Is this the one you have been planning on since last June ? " A slight sigh escaped him as he said , " Yes , it has been postponed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I drive back to Los Angeles of some of the many quotes that have been attributed to him . One in particular stands out in my mind  --  he had said he would like to be remembered in the words : " Feo , fuerte y formal , " which translated from Spanish means , " ugly , strong and dignified . " Well , I know that John Wayne is n't ugly  --  but he is strong and he has a tremendous amount of dignity . As a part of the scene  --  I know that from the inside  --  and the out .
