Federal Reserve Chairman Bill Miller , a take-charge Texan , fights to keep prices in check without starting a recession <P> Central bankers are by tradition an aloof bunch , awed into solemnity by their own eminence as arbiters of a nation 's money supply and guardians of the value of its currency . They immerse themselves in financial esoterica , dress somberly in three-piece blue suits , and give the impression that they speak only to one another and to God . When they do appear in public , they issue Delphian warnings , usually of impending inflationary doom . An optimistic central banker has been defined as " one who thinks the situation is deteriorating less rapidly than before . " <P> So what is one to make of G. ( for George ) William Miller ? As chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board , Miller , 53 , is the most powerful of all central bankers-but he is far outside the mold . He delights in reminiscing about his boyhood in the oil boomtown of Borger , Texas , a throwback to the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembers the day that the town 's founder , Ace Borger , was shot dead in the post office . He cheerfully relates that his last exposure to classroom economics was a basic course at the Coast Guard Academy 33 years ago . All his knowledge of money markets was picked up while he ran Textron Inc. , the $2.8 billion conglomerate based in Providence that makes thousands of products , ranging from helicopters to watchbands . <P> Far from affecting bankerly reserve , Miller roars with laughter at his own often corn-pone jokes , some directed at the august but arcane institution that he heads . He has invented a mythical poll in which 23% of the U.S. population thought the Federal Reserve was an Indian reservation , 26% judged it to be a wildlife preserve and 51% identified it as a brand of whisky . Most important , he speaks almost garrulously in tones of unabashed can-do optimism . The nation , he insists , can bring down its frightening rate of inflation without suffering another recession-indeed , while working toward a " model economy " in the 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far this year inflation has exploded . From March through May , it averaged 11.3% at an annual rate , one of the worst three-month performances ever . Though no one expects the surge to remain that bad , the Carter Administration last week forecast a 7.2% rise for the full year , and some economists expect an 8% increase . <P> A healthy economy can not tolerate that pace . It wipes away most wage and salary gains , lowers standards of living and sets poor , middle class and rich to snarling at one another . It also weakens the dollar overseas : foreign moneymen rush to dump greenbacks out of fear that inflation will steadily erode their value . Last week the dollar slipped to a record low of 201 Japanese yen , down almost 17% just since January . The dollar 's slide , in turn , makes U.S. inflation worse because it raises the prices that Americans pay for imported goods .
