There will be no federally financed day-care centers in our stockings this season . In vetoing a comprehensive child development program that had been approved by Congress , the ' resident said that he had nothing against government-sponsored day care for the poor , and that indeed his proposed welfare plan calls for spending three-quar ? ters of a billion dollars on day-care centers , thus making it possible for poor mothers to " leave the welfare rolls to go on the payrolls . " To make that service available to all mothers , however , was some ? thing else again , even if parents paid what they could afford for the service ; we ought not to commit the " vast moral authority of the na ? tional government to the side of communal approaches to child rear ? ing over against the family-centered approach . " The President wants to " enhance rather than diminish both parental authority and paren ? tal involvement with children ? particularly in those decisive early years when social attitudes and a conscience are formed , and religious and moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for wom ? en , non-poor women that is , is in the home with their youngsters . Perhaps it is , but women do n't seem to think so , or always ca n't afford to think so . The census shows that 43 percent of adult women have jobs ( 31,560,000 ) . Where are their children ? According to the Day Care and Child Development Council of America , as many as 600,000 children of working mothers are left to care for themselves ; more than 70 percent of working mothers with pre-school children leave them in unlicensed facilities or with friends , neighbors or older children . In many instances , that may be quite a congenial arrange ? ment . In many others , it is not . At any rate , the vetoed legislation would not have forced day care on anyone ; it would have made it available , along with health and nutrition services on a voluntary basis . No one has suggested wresting children from their mothers ' arms and , as in Sparta , packing them off to communal camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course he is , as are the editors of The New Republic ( see Correspondence ) . But we are all being pushed to the wall by a no longer silent majority . Thus , the National Women 's Political Caucus , which is seeking to expand women 's political consciousness , has " served notice on all Represen ? tatives in Congress " that it intends to make support of day care for children " a condition for reelection in 1972 . " That applies to presi dential politics , too , a Fact that has not gone unrecog ? nized by the candidates . Senator Muskie , for one , is making quite a point of equal rights for women . " The National Women 's Political Caucus , " he says , " must be heard and heeded by both parties . " The women 's rights movement of the seventies wants equal time . It does n't expect to get it without a fight . True , the Supreme Court a few weeks ago ruled that women are covered by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacks , Chinese laundrymen and Japanese fishermen . But the Justices ' ruling was limited to the particular case before it : all it said was that an obscure Idaho law , which favors men over women to administer es ? tates , is " arbitrary " and unreasonable . Minutes after the Chief Justice had delivered that 7-0 decision , a Senate subcommittee rejected an equal rights amendment , which the House had passed in October by a 354-23 vote . The House had said that " equality of rights under the law shall not be abridged by the US or any state on account of sex . " The Senate subcommittee thought this went too far ; discrimina ? tion " based on physiological or functional differences " is not objectionable . Then the House , after its brave , earlier stand on sex equality , defeated a proposal which would have barred widespread discrimination against women in college admissions . Well , say the militant feminists , what else do you expect when only 12 worn en sit among 422 male colleagues in the House , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it is - in business , the unions , the universities , and in politics . Only 1.3 percent of the mayors of cities over 25,000 are women , 1.7 percent of the policy-makers in the federal government , and less than five percent of the state legislators . That 's as of now , and we can be sure the ratio is going to change . Enter Rep. Bella Abzug , the outspoken activist from Manhattan . She and other women 's rights advocates , including Gloria Steinem , Betty Friedan and Ladonna Harris , are the leaders of the National Women 's Politi ? cal Caucus . Their campaign is markedly different from the more discreet efforts of such groups as the League of Women Voters or the National Organization of Women . Rep. Abzug has been barnstorming the coun ? try , speaking and organizing . " First , " she says , " we need a power base in as many states as possible , to get recognition , get elected and appointed to offices . " The caucus counts 30 states with active chapters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some , like Michigan , Florida and Kentucky , have held statewide conventions , pointing toward a national convention in Washington next April . These women are n't claiming a right , they 're using it to get power . When Abzug first came to Congress , the Vice Presi ? dent said the only thing to fear from her was the possi ? bility she might wear hot pants . The remark was not only tasteless but wrong . It was Abzug who initiated a letter , signed by all the congresswomen , asking the President to appoint a woman to the Supreme Court ( he has appointed 200 women to other " top " govern ? ment posts , largely on various museum advisory boards ) . It was she who tacked on an antisex discrim ? ination clause to the public works act of 1971 , the first such provision on a federal program . It was she , along with Mississippi black leader Fannie Lou Hamer and other caucus members , who met with National Demo ? cratic Committee chairman Lawrence O'Brien and de ? manded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next summer ; who reminded him that two women are running for the 1972 Democratic pres ? idential nomination - Shirley Chisholm and Patsy Mink - and that while women are 52 percent of the voting age population , they accounted for only 13 percent of the delegates at the ' 68 convention . O'Brien and other party leaders responded by urging state and local party officials to recruit more women delegates , so that there will be " reasonable " representation in Miami Beach . But that may not be enough for Abzug : " If we do n't feel the delegations have made a serious effort to comply , there are going to be some credential challenges . " At the very least . " Some politicians are starting to wake up , " one staff member who works for the National Women 's Political Caucus says , " we 'll give the others a kick . " We have ordered our supply of shin guards ; we recommend them to the White House and Congress . Loophole Spying Is the Defense Department still playing I Spy ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files on organizations and individuals ; that agents infil ? trated the Black Panthers and church ski clubs ; that it spied on Abbie Hoffman and former governor Otto Kerner ( presumably the army was interested in mat ? ters unrelated to Kerner 's race track activities for which he was indicted last week ) . A classified docu ? ment obtained recently by The Phoenix , a Boston weekly , reveals that army agents also kept tabs on la ? bor leaders and unions . We know that the army stored its dossiers ( crosslisted in 90 ways ) in computer banks which could instantly provide information on an individual 's financial status and sexual habits . Six months ago , Sen. Sam Ervin ( D , NC ) wrote defense officials asking for details they had failed to provide at hearings last March before his subcommit ? tee on constitutional rights . He has had no helpful answers and now realizes he wo n't get any . " They 've ' DOD officials told us , in effect , they are finished talking with us , " reports committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snooping on civilians back in the 1920 's , during the Red Scare , but the current opera ? tion dates to the early 60s , at the time of the first civil rights marches . Then in May 1968 , an Information Collection Plan was devised to cope with " civil dis ? turbances . " That plan , according to Secretary of the Army Robert Froehlke , was " so comprehensive " ' that it sanctioned " any category of information related even remotely to people or organizations active in a com ? community , " where the army thought " the potential . for a riot or disorder was present. - Agents reported pains ? takingly on churchgoers who , in Sen. Ervin 's words , " do n't seem to have done anything except worship God. - The full extent of the operation reportedly became known to then Under Secretary of the Army , David McGiffert , around December 1968 . Two months later , he issued a memorandum ordering intelligence commanders to sharply reduce spying , and prohibit ? ing any " covert " intelligence gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a detailed intelligence plan , is dated April 23 , 1969 . The reason for the delay , Mr. Froehlke explained last spring , was that the army spent all of 1969 deciding how to carry out McGiffert 's orders , so " full imple ? mentation of the memorandum ... was held in abey ? ance. - It was certainly " held in abeyance " during the November 1969 moratorium demonstration . At one rally in Washington , according to an army intelligence analyst , " there were more army people than Carter has pills . " The McGiffert order notwithstanding , by 1970 , says former intelligence officer Christopher Pyle , " army intelligence was in high gear . " Pyle made this charge in a January 1970 article in The Washington Monthly , and after its publication there was some action . In February , the army assist ? ant joint chief of staff for intelligence ordered the US Army Intelligence Command to destroy its giant computer data banks at Ft . Holabird , Md . On April 1 , the army - advised-  the Continental US Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar oper ? ation , to destroy its computer data banks at Ft . Mon ? roe , Va . Finally , on June 9 , 1970 , the army issued a grand order , which said little more than McGiffert 's order of 16 months earlier , ending not only the compu ? ter operations but future army spying as well . To make sure Congress was listening , the Defense Department issued another order on March 1 of this year ( one day before DOD officials testified before the Ervin subcommittee ) prohibiting civilian spying by every service . But have all the military computer data banks and intelligence files on civilians been destroyed ? Former army general counsel Robert Jordan told Ervin he did n't even know the Ft . Holabird computer existed until he read Pyle 's article in The Washington Monthly , after which he went to Ft . Holabird to investigate . In ? telligence officials there told him they had no such computer . Jordan later found , of course , that they did ( it was the mechanized brain of army intelligence ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed . Again , the officials said no , but Jordan later spotted the Ft . Monroe computer , and discovered that the Third Army in Ft . Hood , Texas had its own computer to keep tabs on activists in Rocky Moun ? tain states . Last spring , The New York Times got its hands on a computer printout which suggests that the army 's Pentagon-level Counterintelligence Analysis Division has a fourth computer data bank , with per ? haps the old information in different form . And Er-vin 's investigators believe the Pentagon 's domestic " war room , " Civil Disturbance Planning and Oper ? ations , has yet another . Destroying the computer data banks does n't destroy raw intelligence , filed in each of the army 's 300 local intelligence offices across the country . Ervin nagged army officials until they assured him that those files , too , would be destroyed . There is some doubt that they have been . Intelligence agents report that " patriotic " colleagues saved their files from the pyre . The army promised to destroy the Compendium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers subversive , but one agent reports that " the orders did n't say burn the information , just destroy the Compendium . " He microfilmed it . Froehlke claims that all copies of the Compendium were burned - except 12 . The Chicago intelligence unit turned over its thick SDS and Weathermen folders to the Chi ? cago police department . Actually , the army has been distributing its secret in ? telligence rather promiscuously . Ft . Holabird sent daily , even hourly reports ( 1200 a month ) over teletype to army commands in Alaska , Hawaii , Europe and Pana ? ma ; to federal agencies like the FBI and CIA ; and - un ? doubtedly to state and local agencies , " says Froehlke : " it 's impossible " to say the files were destroyed . In any event , the army has only said it was destroying files related to " civil disturbance " intelligence . The army classifies intelligence in other ways . So while the civil disturbance file on the NAACP may have been burned the same file may appear under another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ) conceivable organization somewhere , " DOD general counsel J. Fred Buzhardt told Ervin . The Pentagon 's March 1971 order forbids " col ? lecting , reporting , processing , and storing informa ? tion " on nonmilitary civilians - except for operations related to civil disturbances , which is precisely what all the army spying has been about . DOD thinks the exception contains an important safeguard , so impor ? tant that Froehlke repeated it twice : " There shall be no covert or otherwise deceptive surveillance , " he told Ervin . But Froehlke did not emphasize the . next clause : " unless specifically authorized by the Secretary of Defense or his designee " ; or the next clause , which allows any local commander to order covert spying if he decides there 's not enough time to ask for prior approval . In any case , Froehlke admitted there is " a rather obscure demarcation " between " covert " and " direct " intelligence gathering . The army 's June 1970 order said pretty much the same thing , to little effect : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Free Angela Davis rally in Madison , Wisconsin . The DOD order also prohibits computerized data banks on civilians or organizations , again , " unless 7uthorizear by the secretary or a designee . Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird says that we have nothing to fear , because under the latest DOD policy a top civilian official ( himself ) is in control . But top civilians knew about the spying operations long before McGiffert reportedly first became concerned back in December 1968 . " The highest levels of civilian officials " participated - in planning and direction of the Information Collection Plan , " Froehlke told Ervin . " Even in the detailed planning ... both the White House and the Department of Justice had representa ? tives. - Mr. Baskir , the Ervin subcommittee chief counsel , believes the army may have slowed down the opera ? tion for the time being . A Defense Investigative Re ? view Council has been flying to intelligence field of ? fices around the country to see if DOD 's new orders are being followed . But DOD spokesman Robert An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is finding , except that field performance is " uneven . " Ervin says he 'll give the Pentagon until the middle of January to tell the whole army spying story - and then he 'll send out subpoenas . Ervin could help if he published the army hearing transcripts so the public could read them . They 've gathered dust since March . C-5A , Go Away Mat can you do about an airplane that develops wing cracks , loses engines and runs $2 billion over its promised cost ? You can study it . That 's what the Air Force intends to do with its C-5A transport plane for the next 12 months , at a public expenditure of $3.5 million . The Pentagon announced in late Novem ? ber that it had decided to set 130 specialists to work on an enormous review , headed by an Air Force tech ? nical adviser and by F. A. Cleveland , former chief en ? gineer of the Lockheed plant in Marietta , Ga. , where the planes are built . If the C-5A had just begun to show problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project might seem routine . But this plane has ex ? perienced many failures and studies in the past , and none of them has produced a significant change . The C-5A is the world 's biggest airplane and the Air Force 's biggest headache since the the one that occasionally lost wings in mid-flight . Unlike that plane , the C-5A is not a classified project . It was de ? signed to carry oversize cargo and fly on " tactical mis ? sions " - if necessary , to land at night in a rough field . Yet it is one of the most studied machines the Penta ? gon has produced in recent years . Even before the Pentagon had agreed to sign on Lock ? heed for the $3.4 billion job , it bought expensive re ? search called " contract definition " to find out whether the builder would have to invent any " new science " to construct the plane . In signing the contract in Octo ? ber 1965 , the Air Force undertook a new system known as " concurrency production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly line before tests were completed . The Air Force would fol ? low closely behind each stage of production and test ? ing , with options to cancel later segments of the contract if Lockheed were n't meeting standards . Cost experts in the Pentagon soon realized there would be large overexpenditures for the C-5A , and at /east one of them , A. Ernest Fitzgerald , suspected that in cutting corners , Lockheed had " flimsied up the airplane . " Fitzgerald testified to this effect be ? fore a congressional committee in 1968 , stirring up bad publicity for the entire project . About a year later he was fired . In the meantime , the Air Force launched ' a full review of the C-5A directed by Assistant Secre ? tary of the Air Force Philip Whittaker . After three months of study , the experts concluded in July 1969 that although there had been 46 design changes , " none of these changes has degraded the mission per ? formance ... At looks as though we 'll have a good aircraft . " The optimism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later testing , however , and once again in February 1970 , the Air Force commissioned a study of the C-5A . This one , headed by MIT pro ? fessor Raymond Bissplinghoff , would last for five months and assemble reports from independent re DECEMBER 25 , 1971 searchers , Air Force inspectors and representatives of all the major aerospace corporations . They con ? cluded in June that the C-5A had " slight deficiencies of range " and minor problems with landing gear and avionics ( flight instruments ) . The wings , which had been so troublesome in tests , might require " further engineering changes ... to correct deficiencies not yet located . " That was all . They could n't offer any stronger judgment until tests had run further . Two days later another wing cracked in the laboratory . The latest major report appeared in March of this year when the Government Accounting Office released information it dug up for Sen. William Proxmire ( D , Wis . ) . Based on an examination of the first 15 planes turned over to the Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear , wings and avi ? onics " meant that " the C-5A can not perform its tacti ? cal mission . " Unless these were corrected , the plane would have to serve merely as a cargo transport ? and a risky one at that . More wing cracks have appeared in ground testing since then , and in September an en ? gine flew away from the wing of an airplane prepar ? ing for take-off . For a while , the entire fleet was grounded to check for cracks in engine pylons , which had not been a problem before . Almost all the planes are now back in operation . The Air Force has committed itself to buying 81 of these C-5As under a new contract that absolves Lock ? heed of the cost of refitting them if they fail to meet standards . Lockheed , which is about two years behind schedule and charging $2 billion more than originally promised , has finished 47 planes and is working on the 70th . When the new study comes out in 1973 , production should be over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million piece of research ? Well , it could use it to start over from the beginning , asking Congress for the hundreds of millions it would cost to reinforce the planes and bring them up to standards . More likely the report will follow its predecessors into the files , and the Air Force will make do with the C-5A as it is , hiding the cost of necessary repairs in a less controversial section of the budget . Hold Your Nose Last New Year 's Day , the President of the United States resolved that " the ' 70s absolutely must be the years when America pays its debt to the past by re ? claiming ... its waters . It is literally now or never . " Congress got around to agreeing , and last month the Senate voted 86-0 to end all water pollution by 1985 , by prohibiting industries and municipalities from dumping any wastes into waterways . The millennium would be reached in steps : municipalities would start building 85 percent-effective sewage treatment plants 9 by 1974 ; industries would use the " best practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best available " technological devices by 1981 . The House Public Works Committee will soon vote on a similar proposal . It 's the toughest anti-pollution program Congress has ever considered - and the administration is fight-ing hard to defeat it . Russell Train , director of the Council on Environmental Quality , told House com ? mittee members that under such a strict timetable , " water quality in many cases may suffer . " Angry in ? dustries , he implied , would do nothing rather than comply . Paul McCracken , Chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers , warned that an expen ? sive all-out anti-pollution effort might cripple the economy , force industries to close and move to foreign countries with weaker pollution laws . The White House had a seven-member science panel , including the President 's top science adviser , write a strong " anti " letter . Congress , Train warned , would pass the new legislation " only at the peril of wasting billions in re ? sources and losing public acceptance for environmen ? tal programs . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's water has never been worse . While William Ruckelshaus , director of the Environmental Protection Agency , was testifying against the bill , his agency was preparing a report showing that the Mississippi River threatens human health in southern Louisiana and aquatic life in the Gulf of Mexico . Administration officials say that current methods of fighting water pollution , dating to 1966 , are the most practicable : states establish water quality stand ? ards which define just how polluted a particular lake or river can be , according to its uses - swimming , drinking or cesspool . The states then regulate indus ? trial discharge factory by factory , to hold pollution to the desired level - except that only 40 states have established water quality standards and few enforce them , which is the way industry likes it . The EPA esti ? mates that at least 44,000 industries should have ap ? plied for permits to dump wastes into navigable wa ? ters by July , but less than half did . " Virtually no per ? mits have been issued , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumping wastes . Since September , EPA has asked the Justice Department to sue 35 corporations which are dumping without permits , but only three of the companies are major polluters ( EPA has classified 3000 major and 7000 significant polluters nationwide . ) Only five of the cases have gone to court . EPA is sitting on half a dozen files which show that other major corporations are dumping toxic wastes without permits , but it wo n't send them to Justice . " We could sue every industry in the country if we wanted , " Quarles says . But EPA wants to work harmoniously with industries , not an ? tagonize them . Pollution technicians know little about the precise relationship between particular types of waste and water quality , so it 's hard to regulate individual indus ? tries effectively . That 's why the Senate decided to for ? get water standards and turn off the pollution at its source : municipal and industrial waste pipes . That across-the-board approach , however , would soak up $94.5 billion in the next decade , according to Train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on current costs of the nation 's most expensive sewage treatment fa ? cility , at Lake Tahoe . Supporters of the new bills say that neither Train nor they can effectively estimate long-range costs , since pollution technology is in its infancy . The Senate would begin by spending $14 billion over the next four years ; the House committee would ask for $20 billion . The President says $6 billion for the next three years is the most the econ ? omy can stand . ( The government already owes states and cities $1.6 billion for sewage plants it promised to finance but did n't . ) We 're back to the old question of social priorities : the Defense Department easily won initial funding for the new B-1 bomber , which will cost at least $11 billion . The Money Muddle Gradually , the western world is moving toward a new system of monetary exchange rates and a more stable pattern of world trade , but following the story is not easy . In meeting with the French president last week , Mr. Nixon agreed to raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the dollar in terms of gold ) , a decision that was widely hailed as " devaluation . " ' Ac ? tually , the move was a symbolic gesture required to ap ? pease the French national ego as interpreted by Pompidou . Since August 15 , the United States has not been converting dollars into gold , for foreign banks or anyone else , and has no intention of resuming ; so the gold price change is practically without meaning . The meat of the story is what the US receives in re ? turn for this honorific concession a French agree ? ment to go along with our other trading partners in permitting their currency to rise in value in relation to ours , which is the essence of a true devaluation . As of December 13 , the day before the Nixon-Pompidou meeting , other major national currencies , except for the French franc , had been revalued upward by more than eight percent . With new French coopera ? tion , it is expected that this trend will continue toward the final goal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nixon 's advisers to im ? prove the competitiveness of US goods abroad so that our weak balance of payments can be corrected . The final adjustment , however , will have to wait upon settlement of some important side issues . On August 15 President Nixon imposed a temporary 10percent surcharge on imports . That tax was to be lifted when Japan , West Germany and the rest re ? valued their currency as we desired . Then Treasury Secretary Connally added further conditions - removal of special trade barriers against American goods and greater contributions toward our defense expenses abroad . Here 's where the hard bargaining will go on , in forthcoming meetings of the Group of Ten com ? prising the major industrial nations . Smoke Signals Some tentative observations are occasioned by India 's victory in East Pakistan ( Bangla Desh ) . First and most obvious is that the Nixon administration has egg on its face . It not only backed a loser but was pre ? sumptuous enough to lecture the victor on interna ? tional morality , as if the world were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other peoples ' civil wars in Indochina and to a lesser extent in Central America . Since it is in the long-range interest of the US and India ( we have a grain surplus , India has starva ? tion ) both nations will grope , painfully , toward some sort of accommodation . It might not even take Wash ? ington as long to recognize the new state of Bangla Desh as it took to arrange the Kissinger trip to China . Finally , the Soviet Union , by its singleminded military and diplomatic support of India , has for the moment strengthened its position in South Asia , and one can be sure that the Chinese , looking south at what has happened and looking north to a million Soviet troops on her border , will not feel reassured ; the Soviet-Chinese feud will remain at white heat . As the afternoon of December 9 wore into dusk with no sign of an expected veto message from Mr. Nixon , the joke in the White House press room was that the President must be having a hard time making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas . The bill that he had signalled his intention to veto ex ? tended the Economic Opportunity Act for two years , established a National Legal Services Corporation to help poor people , and authorized the expenditure of $2 billion a year for " comprehensive child develop ? ment programs , including a full range of health , edu ? cation and social services . " Congress had just decided
