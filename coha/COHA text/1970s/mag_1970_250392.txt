Dear Jack : <P> Your editorial on Thanksgiving hit the mark , even to your point on the Mets and the Jets . In reviewing the nation 's problems you mentioned it occurred to me that many have said we can not solve them , just as many said that the Mets and Jets could not win , hut with the kind of support you are giving us I am confident that we , too , will win the big ones . <P> With warm personal regards , <P> Sincerely , <P> R.N. <P> So reads one of several thank-you notes that President Richard Nixon has written to Francis M. ( " Jack " ) Flynn , publisher of New York 's hardhatted morning tabloid , the Daily News . It is not a new correspondence ; Nixon also wrote to the News when he was Vice President and later , when he was out of office trying to get back in . ( In those days the letters were signed " Dick . " ) So it was no big surprise when the President dropped by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Flynn and his top editors . No wonder , either , that one of those around the table was the man who writes almost all the nice Nixon editorials , Reuben Maury . <P> Now 70 , Maury has in fact been writing almost all the News editorials for the past 44 years . His sledgehammer style is better suited to knocking than building , but he and the News have had their heroes . There was , for instance , Joe McCarthy , who ( Maury once told an interviewer ) " fought Communists the way we thought they should be fought . " There was Herbert Hoover , who " came close to sainthood . " And J. Edgar Hoover . <P> Currently there is S.I . Hayakawa , " the nononsense , gutful chief of San Francisco State College . " A Maury editorial this month urged Hayakawa 's appointment as president of Harvard to " fumigate the campus Commies and anarchists . " There is Spiro Agnew , in whom Maury perhaps sees something of himself . " I admire a fella , " he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on his feet and says what he thinks in words everybody can understand . " But above all there is Richard Nixon , who , Maury feels , was " called to his exalted office by the Lord " as well as by the voters . <P> In his inimitable manner , Maury has expressed the News ' support of Nixon on every major issue . He has cheered him for not " bugging out " of Viet Nam ; he lauded the entry of U.S. troops into Cambodia " to root Reds and Red war materiel out of hidy-holes there " ; he has sympathized with Nixon over college officials who " bellyache " about campus disorders ; he has urged Congress to " quit foozling and fussing around " with proposed anticrime legislation .
