txt He received four transfer . notices  --  from Los ? Angeles to Anadarko , Okla. , from Anadarko to Chicago , from Chicago to Anadarko and back to Chicago again  --  an during 1971 . Some fancy footwork enabled him to remain in California all the while ; meanwhile , though , his $25,000-a-year salary was being taxed simultaneously in Oklahoma , Illinois and California . Or the government can simply abolish the bureaucrat 's position . The agencies are required by regulations to offer him a new position in return , but there 's a catch : it does n't always have to be at the same grade or even in the same area . And the bureaucrat becomes subject to dismissal if he turns it down . Union men assert such practites often lead to gross inequities , even absurdities . When the government slashed manpower recently at Tobyhanna Army Depot , near Scranton , Pa. , the victims included 15 white-collar women supply clerks . They were offered new slots , but in less prestigious blue-collar jobs  --  sometimes jobs that had little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing about soldering , " mutters one , who was offered a job as a helper to an electronics ' equipment repairman . " I 'm even allergic to dust . " Another , more subtle , approach is to temporarily assign the bureaucrat out of town  --  or to a different section of the same department in town  --  then bring him back to a job that had been filled or no longer exists . That 's what happened to a 54-year-old public-information specialist at the Interior Department recently . She was reassigned to the Secretary 's office on a special project : when she came back her old job was no longer open , and the only position open at her grade level was something she knew nothing about . She took that job anyway  --  and then the government eliminated it . Now she is appealing her pending dismissal on the ground that she was denied her " bumping " rights . Bumping rights are very important to federal employes . They allow a civil servant caught up in a RBI to " bump " another employe instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is working in the same " competitive area . " Thus , everything depends on how widely  --  or narrowly  --  the agency defines the competitive area for a specific task . For a routine job , it may be limited to a certain division , certainly to the city in which the job exists . But for high-level professional or executive posts , it RIFfed in Detroit , for-example , might bump a somewhat-less-senior official in San Diego , who , in turn , might bump a hapless fellow is Houston . An employe who finds it impossible to " bump " can always " retreat " That means moving down to a position from which he was once promoted . There 's a catch , of course . He must have more years of total government ser- , vice than the current occupant of his former position . The beauty of retreating is that . the employe is guaranteed a job . The bad thing about retreating is that it will almost certainly cost him a chunk of self-esteem  --  and at some point a chunk of salary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being denied normal bumping rights . Consider the plight of two assistant regional directors in the Interior Department 's Minneapolis-St Paul office . Recently , the government labolished their jobs and offered them new ones , but at lower grades . To have hung on to their old grade they would have had to bump somebody ; there was nobody to bump because their competitive area had been defined as the Mionespolisa . Paid region . - Since the men refused to accept the lower-paying jobs that were available , they were forced to retire . They 're appealing . Tire Woos also are critical of the specific actions being taken by federal agencies to lower civil servants ' average grade level , which crept up to 7.9 in 1970 from 7.4 in 1968 .

Last August , the ce of Management and Budget ordered a reduction of one-tenth point in the average for both fiscal years 1972 and 1973 . So far , most agencies have moved to comply with the instructions that many tasks be performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , ordered personnel chiefs to limit promotions severely , reorganise work so it can be accomplished with lower-grade employes , use technicians in some jobs where profensInnals have been used in the past , refill at least 50% of all professional vacancies with trainees and evaluate each position becoming vacant to determine whether it can be abolished or restructured at a lower grade . " This is unfair , " argues the union 's Mr. Wolkomir , " because , among other things , ' you end up with lower-grade people doing the same work as higher-grade people , but not getting paid anywhere near as much . " All these developments are driving bureaucrats to new depths of gloominess . " Morale is going to pot , " grumbles a 50-year-old biologist in the Interior Department 's Chicago office .
