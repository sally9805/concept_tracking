When he died in 1971 , Nikita Khrushchev was officially a nonperson . Despite his eleven years as Soviet party chief , he was denied the usual honors of burial at the Kremlin Wall and was instead allotted a plot in the far corner of the Novodyevichy Cemetery , Moscow 's second-ranking burial ground . The newspapers that had once headlined his speeches identified him in his death notice only as a " pensioner of the state . " <P> The Khrushchev family was obviously resentful of this treatment and decided on their own to erect a monument in Novodyevichy . At a cost of about $20,000 , the family hired Ernst Neizvestny , the Soviet Union 's most talented sculptor . <P> The choice was curiously appropriate . Touring a show of experimental art in 1962 , Khrushchev was startled by what he saw . He likened it to " painting done by an ass with its tail . " Neizvestny was the most prominent artist represented , and he argued forcefully against Khrushchev for an hour . Though the party chief did not change his views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense and , as he left , told the artist : " You are the kind of man I like . " Later , after his forced retirement , Khrushchev expressed regret for having argued with Neizvestny at all . " If I met him now , I would apologize , " he said . <P> Neizvestny 's monument , which will be formally unveiled this week on the third anniversary of Khrushchev 's death , is symbolically strong , a massive ( 9 ft. high , 5 ft. wide ) abstract of white marble and black granite with a bronze bust of Khrushchev in the center . The white and black blocks , says Neizvestny , represent the bright and dark periods of Khrushchev 's career , as well as the bright and dark periods of Soviet life .
