The warning signals of recession flashed more insistently than ever across the U.S. economy last week . <P> Unemployment rose to its highest level in 4 years . The February jobless rate was 4.2% , up from 3.9% in January . In human terms , the figures mean that 3,800,000 people were out of work last month , compared with only 3,400,000 a month earlier . The configuration of the increase looks even more disturbing than the totals . Labor Department officials said that about three-fifths of the unemployment rise during January and February involves workers who have lost their jobs , rather than new workers who have not yet found positions . Unemployment among nonwhites , which was surprisingly stable in the fall , jumped last month from 6.3% to 7%-a portent of social as well as economic difficulties . <P> As economists expected , the brunt of the overall increase in joblessness has hit blue-collar workers in durable-goods manufacturing , the major sinew of U.S. economic abundance . In just twelve months , the durable-goods jobless rate almost doubled-from a post-Korean War low of 2.5% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a winter of declining sales and layoffs of thousands of workers , accounted for one-third of the February rise in unemployment , Government statisticians said . <P> Automakers ' problems look almost picayune compared with those of the mighty aerospace industry , the nation 's largest manufacturing employer . Last week sixth-ranking Lockheed Aircraft Corp . announced a $32.6 million net loss for 1969 , against a profit of $44.5 million the year before . Because of a contract dispute with the Defense Department , the company wrote off $150 million against pretax income . Now it has asked the Pentagon for a $600 million cash advance . Without the money , said Lockheed Chairman Daniel J. Haughton , the company will have to stop work on four major military programs : its C-5A cargo jets , Cheyenne helicopters , missile engines and ships . All four programs involve disputes between Lockheed and the armed forces over eventual contract prices . <P> Downsigns . The Nixon Administration 's efforts to combat inflation by slowing the economy have long been expected to squeeze corporate profits . Even so , the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business fortunes . A survey last month by the New York Stock Exchange showed that the net income of 559 Big Board companies dropped 11% in 1969 from the year before . Some industries fared much worse . Earnings of the twelve largest U.S. airlines plunged 43% last year to $152 million , as operating costs soared and the growth of passenger traffic slowed . Retailers have also experienced disappointing profits , partly because they have been forced to cut prices to lure inflation-conscious customers . For example , J.C . Penney Co. ' s net income rose only 1.7% last year to $110.9 million despite a 13% sales gain to $3.75 billion . Almost all of the economic figures that wiggle watchers study now point down . The statisticians have stopped saying " Wait until next month . " Right now the price of cooling inflation is taking its toll of the nation 's labor force and much of its industry .
