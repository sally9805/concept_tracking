Behavior <P> Teen-age suicides galvanize a New Jersey community <P> Hours after the burial of Jeffrey Hunter , 16 , four of his classmates at Ridgewood High School sat talking about the death . Why had Hunter hanged himself ? Suddenly , Christopher Mathieson , also 16 , rose , said he had something to do and sped home on his moped . Sensing trouble , the other students ran to Mathieson 's house . They found him hanging in a stairway closet . <P> Jeff and Chris are the third and fourth Ridgewood , N.J. , youngsters to die by their own hands in the past 18 months . The suicides sent shock waves through the affluent suburb ( pop . 27,500 ) , only 20 miles from Manhattan . Students cried unashamedly in school halls and embraced each other . A school official broke down during an interview . Bewildered parents repeatedly asked , " Why is it happening here ? " <P> Actually , the deaths could have happened almost anywhere in the U.S. , where the rate of suicides among teen-agers has been rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community 's spirited reaction to its tragedy . Immediately after the news of Mathieson 's death , school officials worked through the night to map a strategy for dealing with the crisis . School Superintendent Samuel Stewart realized that he had two options : he could react dramatically to the community 's grief by canceling classes , holding a school assembly or undertaking some other large new program , or he could underplay the deaths for fear that such public activity might trigger more suicides . <P> Taking the muted approach , Stewart and his staff convened all 107 high school teachers at 7:15 a.m. and urged them to break the news to small groups of students during homeroom periods . " We decided not to interrupt school routine in any way , " he said . During the day , the school 's seven guidance counselors , joined by 15 Ridgewood clergymen , set up desks around the high school , offering counseling to any students who wanted it . <P> Nearly half of the 1,600 high school students immediately asked for help . Says School Psychologist Abe Matus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of helplessness and anger at the dead boys-'How could they do this to me ? ' ' But Matus feels that the healing process has already taken hold . " If a kid is in trouble , word now gets back to us . A lot of trust between faculty and students has been built up . " Many of the youngsters seemed to need assurance that they would not kill themselves . Says School Social Worker Robert Klopfer : " Even though they had no real intention of committing such an act , the boundaries between thoughts and actions are blurred under such circumstances . Many kids were frightened . " <P> Officials are attempting a " psychological autopsy " of the two dead youths , since , on the surface , there seems no satisfying explanation for the suicides . Mathieson was a moody loner , some of whose troubles were known to school counselors . Hunter 's suicide was more baffling : a gregarious athlete , he seemed to be happy and functioning well . Though they knew each other , the boys were not close friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
