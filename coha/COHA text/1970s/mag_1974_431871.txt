 | Are UFOs For Real ? @# LAST October 3 , a deputy sheriff and four National Park Serv-ice rangers watched amazed as a saucer-shaped object " the size of a two-bedroom house , " with red , green and yellow rotating lights , maneuvered over Tupelo , Miss . Two weeks later , 50 miles south of Cleveland , a U.S. Army helicopter narrowly missed a midair collision with a domed , metallic , cigar-shaped craft " exactly like those unbelievable sketches of UFOs . " According to the pilot , Capt . Lawrence J. Coyne , he was forced to take the helicopter into a rapid descent , then was mysteriously swept 2000 feet straight up toward the unidentified craft . These are just two of hundreds of apparently authentic UFO reports that jammed police and news-media switchboards during the fall of 1973 . From Georgia to California , America was in the grip of a major UFO " flap . " Saucer Sightings . Unidentified flying objects first soared into the news in this country on June 24 , 1947 , when Kenneth Arnold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington , saw nine disc-like objects skimming along at high speed and in an unconventional manner " as a saucer would if you skipped it across the water . " A newspaperman who interviewed Arnold coined the term " flying saucer , " and within a month UFOs had been reported in every state in the Union . Since then , an astonishing number of UFO reports have been accumu- lated : reports that solid , metallic craft , which defy explanation within the framework of contemporary science , are violating our air space . These unknown craft appear on radarscopes and in photographs . They disrupt TV and radio reception , cause car engines to stall , animals to panic , produce strange physiological effects ( including " sunburn , " temporary paralysis and mild radiation sickness ) on close-contact witnesses . When they " land , " they leave withered foliage , inexplicable chemical changes in the soil , and scorched circles with " tripod " marks in fields . University of Colorado psychologist David R. Saunders has collected and computerized more than 6o,000 reports by individual witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from crackpots , or even from UFO buffs , but from people who had absolutely no interest in flying saucers ? until they saw one . They are people of sound mind and reputation whose testimony on any other subject would be accepted without hesitation . As one former director of intelligence at the Pentagon , Maj. Gen. John Samford , declared : " Reports have come from credible observers of relatively incredible things . " Almost invariably , witnesses assume at first that they are seeing some familiar object ? the flashing light on an ambulance or a low-flying plane . Only when they notice that " the thing " has stopped in midair , is changing color and has no wings , do they realize that they are looking at something they have never seen before . When Coyne threw his helicopter into a quick descent , for instance , he first thought that a jet fighter was racing toward him through the night sky . " But if it was a jet , " he told me later , " the lights were completely inverted according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways . " Shortly after Coyne 's experience , Sen. Barry Goldwater , a major general in the Air Force Reserve , made this statement to the press : " I 've never seen a UFO , but when Air Force pilots , Navy pilots and airline pilots tell me they see something come up on their wing that was n't an airplane , I have to believe them . " " Gray-Skinned Creatures . " The 1973 wave of sightings began on the night of August 30 , when UFOs were reported in 22 different Georgia towns . By early October , I was working at the National Broadcasting Company in New York on a UFO television documentary . Bundles of newspaper clippings and wire-service reports overflowed my desk , and a huge map of the United States bristled with colored pins as we tracked the flap . Our chief adviser for the documentary was J. Allen Hynek , chairman of Northwestern University 's Department of Astronomy and director of the Lindheimer Astronomical Research Center . Hynek , for 17 years UFO consultant to the Air Force , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just arrived in New York when  | United Press International transmitted the following message : PASCAGOULA , MISS . TWO SHIPYARD WORKERS WHO CLAIMED THEY WERE HAULED ABOARD A UFO WERE TAKEN TO A MILITARY HOSPITAL FRIDAY TO BE CHECKED FOR RADIATION . On Thursday evening , October i t , while Charles Hickson , 45 , and Calvin Parker , 19 , were fishing on the Pascagoula River , a strange craft emitting a bluish light allegedly descended and hovered just above the ground 3o feet away . When three gray creatures emerged , Parker fainted . But Hickson later described being immobilized , " floated aboard , " and examined from head to foot by something that looked like a huge electronic eye . On Saturday morning , muttering about the quality of Southern corn liquor , I found myself on a plane with Hynek , headed for Mississippi . We went at once to Pascagoula 's F. B. Walker &; Sons , Inc. , a shipyard where Hickson and Parker were employed , to interview them . Hynek joined James Harder , professor of civil engineering at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organization , who had flown in that morning . It was now 44 hours since Hickson and Parker had allegedly been " floated aboard " the UFO . I asked Sheriff Fred Diamond , " Do you believe their story ? " Diamond looked hard at me . " First thing they wanted to do afterward was to take a lie-detector test . Charlie , he was shook bad . You do n't see a 45-year-old man cry unless something fierce happened . And Calvin ? I heard that boy pray when he thought nobody could hear . Certainly they were frightened . " Beyond Reasonable Doubt ? Diamond introduced me to Detective Tom Huntley , who described how impressed he was by a tape recording made in the sheriff 's office a few hours after the UFO encounter . While Harder was attempting to verify the two men 's experience through regression hypnosis , I went with Huntley to his office and listened to the tape . I could hear the strain in Hickson 's voice as he told his extraordinary story . Then the two men were left alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was impossible , listening to their voices , not to believe that something terrifying had happened to them . PARKER : I got to get home and get to bed or see a doctor or something . HICKSON : I 've never seen nothin ' like it . I ca n't believe it ? you ca n't make people believe it . PARKER ( his voice rising ) : My arms just froze up and I could n't move . Just like I stepped on a damn rattlesnake . HICKSON : I know , son . I know Then Hickson left the room , and Parker was alone . " It 's hard to believe , " he said softly . " 0 God , it 's awful . . . . I know there 's a God up there . . . . " His words , as he prayed , became inaudible . Later , when the hypnotic session was over , I met Hickson and Parker . They looked on the verge of col- lapse . " I just keep thinking , " Hickson said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off ? You 'd have dragged the river and then forgot about us . " He shook his head slowly . " I 've lain out on a battlefield at night , fighting North Koreans and Chinese , and I know what fear is . I lived 20 months and 16 days in combat in Korea . But I 've never seen that much terror and that much fear on a man 's face as I saw on Calvin 's . " As we entered the packed conference room , a company official said to me : " They 're just country boys . Neither of them has enough imagination to concoct such a tale or enough guile to carry it off . " Hynek opened the press conference . " There 's simply no question in my mind , " he said , " that these men have had a very real , frightening experience . " Then Harder made the strongest statement I had ever heard from a scientist : " The experience that they underwent was indeed a real one . A very strong feeling of terror is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left with the conclusion that we 're dealing with an extraterrestrial phenomenon . I can say so beyond any reasonable doubt . " On October 30 , Hickson was given a lie-detector test . Polygraph operator Scott Glasgow found that " Hickson told the truth when he stated ( 1 ) that he believed he saw a spaceship , ( 2 ) that he believed he was taken aboard a spaceship and ( 3 ) that he believed he saw three space creatures . " Of course , there may well be an explanation for this incident that does not involve extraterrestrial beings . Still , after close study , I found my initial skepticism regarding their curious tale to have been severely shaken . Worldwide Frequency . According to the latest Gallup poll on the subject , 15 million Americans now claim to have seen a UFO , and 51 percent of the adult population believe that UFOs are " real . " While a large percentage of these sightings can be attributed to misidentification of known objects , there remains a significant residue that can not be explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not meteors , not flocks of migrating geese , not weather balloons , not Venus , not space debris , not swamp gas , not temperature inversions , not multiple-witness hallucinations , and not plastic garbage bags lighted by candles . Hynek has already collected 1474 authentic UFO reports for last year in this country alone . And , according to the late James E. McDonald , who was senior physicist at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics and professor at the University of Arizona , the nature of UFO reports is roughly the same around the globe . While officials in most countries , perhaps following America 's lead , have tended to explain away UFOS whenever possible , the French have openly acknowledged the reality of the phenomenon . The Gendarmerie Nationale ( national guard ) makes a report on all witnesses ' ac- Halts of UFO cases , which it then communicates to the regional authorities . In Russia , Felix Ziegel of i he Moscow Institute of Aviation declared in 1967 at a conference on Space Civilizations : " We have welldocumented sightings from every corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optical illusions . Illusions do n't register clearly on photographic plates and radar . " On the other hand , there is the opinion of the late Edward U. Condon , formerly professor of physics at the University of Colorado and director of the Air Force-sponsored study of UFos that produced the socalled Condon Report . It was essentially because of the findings of his committee ( " further extensive study of UFOs probably can not be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby " ) that the Air Force discontinued its investigation of UFOs in 1969 . " UFOs are an absolutely dead-end street , a waste of time , " Condon once told me . " God knows how many times a genuine ' UFO report turns out to be Venus . In my opinion , all non-explained sightings are from poor observers . I admit there are some things we do n't understand , but then some people still believe in leprechauns . " " After the Condon report , " Hynek says , " the doctors of science gave the UFO a decent burial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hynek himself never quit his quiet research and has established a Center for UFO Studies at Northfield , Ill. , with a toll-free telephone number that has been distributed to law-enforcement officers and civilian and government agencies . What UFOs are and where they come from are still matters for speculation , but it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore them . There have been too many precise and detailed reports from state policemen , radar experts and professional pilots ? men trained to make accurate observations . According to astronaut Gordon Cooper , " People have seen flying saucers at close hand , and in many cases they have been verified on radar . It is ridiculous to say that they 're all completely unreal . " Since the days of Copernicus , mankind has been learning , painfully , that it is not the center of creation . In fact , we may be far out in the boondocks of space . Most scientists agree that our sun is middleaged compared to some second- and third-generation stars , and that there could be beings in many places in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours . Why , then , would n't these " beings " have means of transportation to make our spaceships look as primitive as the covered wagon ? @#
