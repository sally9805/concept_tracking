How will McDonnell Douglas Corp. , the nation 's largest defense contractor with 1978 sales of $4.13 billion , weather the troubles afflicting its DC-10 ? Investors are taking a gloomy view . Since the Chicago disaster , the company 's stock has dropped from $28.25 to $20.88 . <P> Before the accident , the planemaker was looking good . It had more than $750 million in cash and , after its slow start , its ten-year , $1 billion investment in the DC-10 was about to pay off . The company needs 400 sales of the $40 million plane to cover costs and start making profits . It has already delivered 281 , received firm orders for 49 , and taken options-which buyers could still cancel-for 50 . Last year the Douglas commercial-plane side , which McDonnell had acquired in 1967 , lost $60.3 million , mainly because of unrecovered DC-10 costs . This was more than offset by the pretax profit of $281 million earned by other departments , primarily the McDonnell military division , which makes the F-4 Phantom , F-15 Eagle and F-18A Hornet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its strength to remain healthy in face of the consequences of the Chicago crash . Its potential liabilities : <P> &gt;Most of the heirs of the 275 victims will file lawsuits against McDonnell Douglas . Estimates put its potential payout at around $100 million . The greatest part of the damages would be covered by insurers , but the company itself would have to pay any punitive awards . <P> &gt;Airlines flying the DC-10 are losing $5 million a day because of its decertification and grounding right at the start of the peak summer travel season . If the suspension goes on long enough , many may sue McDonnell Douglas , but , again , insurance would probably cover most of the bill . <P> &gt;McDonnell Douglas would have to pay for any Government-ordered repairs . Each of the 275 planes in service has two potentially troublesome pylons , holding the wing engines , that might have to be replaced . Cost : $500,000 each . But more extensive design changes , for which the company probably has no insurance , could add to that $275 million bill . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . Reason : switching to alternative models would cause a costly lack of common parts , service and training . Yet the DC-10 's troubles could cause new buyers to steer away from the plane and thus delay its break-even . Worse still , in the highly unlikely event of a permanent grounding , McDonnell Douglas would not only be sued by airlines that have paid a total of about $10 billion for DC-10s but would also have to write off the plane 's $574 million of unrecovered development costs , more than triple last year 's after-tax earnings . <P> Almost certainly , McDonnell Douglas will survive the travail of the DC-10 . At worst , James ( " Old Mac " ) McDonnell , the company 's octogenarian chairman , would close the Douglas division and face a few tough years . Alternatively , the Pentagon could step in with a Lockheed-type federal bailout to protect its No. 1 supplier , though that will probably not be necessary . Military officers who have long been dealing with the company agree on one thing : " Old Mac is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
