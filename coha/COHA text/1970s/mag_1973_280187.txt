When the Communists released the names of their prisoners-and then the prisoners themselves-the families of 1,340 men had to bear a shock : those 1,340 were still officially listed as missing in action . Legally , the M.I.A.s are still alive , but their wives and children live in a limbo of both legal and personal uncertainties . Last week a salute to veterans was held at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas . Such public celebrations serve only to intensify the anguish of M.I.A.wives , and some stayed away . One such wife , interviewed by TIME 'S Joseph J Kane , is Peggie Duggan of El Paso . <P> " I ran into the worst emotional bump when the lists of prisoners came out , " says Peggie Duggan . " I was really expecting a big list . My antenna was up . Then I watched the P.O.W.s return on television . I do n't know-I could n't stay away-it was like a bird being hypnotized by a snake . <P> " Now , whenever I see a returned P.O.W. I bite my cheek inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear certain songs , you know you 've had it . I come home and play the piano or the organ . I play a lot of Bach-oh , do I play a lot of Bach . " <P> Peggie Duggan , a handsome brunette of 34 , lives with her two children in a large house atop Mount Franklin overlooking El Paso . It is elegantly furnished with Persian rugs , brass candlesticks and French Provincial chairs . On New Year 's Eve in 1971 Peggie Duggan received an unexpected visit from an Air Force major with a grim message : the F-4D jet fighter flown by her husband , Major William Young Duggan , 38 , had been shot down that same day over the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos . It was his second combat tour in Viet Nam , his 454th combat mission-and in the 17 months since then nothing has been heard about him . <P> Harsh Reality . Talk in the Duggan household usually runs to teen-age beauty contests , minor league baseball games or a month-long visit to the family ranch near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband may never be found . At first she left everything as it was , not moving , for example , the old truck that her husband liked to drive . <P> Until last week Texas law , like the law in most other states , declared that a person had to be missing for seven years before he could be declared legally dead . But at the urging of Peggie Duggan , Governor Dolph Briscoe personally wrote an amendment , which passed the legislature just three minutes before the deadline of its final session last week . Now a man missing in action is considered dead when the Pentagon issues a death certificate . <P> With that , Peggie at last will be able to sell stock that is held in Bill 's name.The Air Force sends her two-thirds of his paycheck of about $1,800 a month ; it deposits the rest in a savings account that can not be drawn on unless a reason is given in writing . <P> " The terror needs time to heal , " she says . " I just cling to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can only hope they will find one of them in a cave somewhere . "
