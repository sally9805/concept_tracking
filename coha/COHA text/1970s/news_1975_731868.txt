txt Sen. Richard Schweiker ( R ) of Pennsylvania tells the story of the enormous appropriations item for naval " spare parts " that came to the House Armed Services Committee while he was a member . " That 's a huge sum for spare parts ! " protested Mr. Schweiker , who himself served on an aircraft carrier in World War II . In an intermission , one of the senior members took him aside . " Go easy on those spareparts , " he whispered , " that 's the appropriation for the CIA . " Suddenly Congress is deluged with controversies over questionable practices of the CIA , the FBI , and , earlier , of the White House and other executive agencies in the Watergate scandal over which Congress theoretically has purse-string control . An embarrassed Congress is discovering what political scientists have charged for years , that legislative oversight is faltering , or is in abeyance . Since this is crucial in America 's separation of powers , some wonder if it affects the whole government . Here are examples : ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay of Pigs ( Cuban ) invasion , the White House " tilt " in the India-Pakistan dispute , the operation to " unstabilize " the Allende government in Chile , and the secret bombing of Cambodia .

" Frustration voiced Spasmodic efforts to regain legislative control are currently being pushed , including those by a special Senate committee under Frank Church ( D ) of Idaho , a similar committee in the House , and by a White House group under the Vice-President . Congressional statements range from angry to helpless . Samples : Sen. Edmund S. Muskie ( D ) of Maine ? " Everyone recognizes the need for oversight but other things come along , " Rep. Philip R. Sharp ( D ) of Indiana ? " More and more of our people feel frustration about dealing with government . " Sen. Thomas F. Eagieton ( D ) of Missouri ?
