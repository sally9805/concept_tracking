It is the Year of the Tiger on the Chinese calendar , which could be prophetic for this division . The Bengals of Cincinnati won six straight games at the end of last season to edge past Pittsburgh for the division championship , and Coach Paul Brown 's troops may just keep on winning . // Evidence of the Bengals ' new stature came during the draft . In the first round Cincinnati selected Bill Kollar , a defensive tackle from Montana State . The defensive tackle spots on the Bengals are currently manned by All-Pro Mike Reid , who sang the national anthem in full uniform before one exhibition game this year , and Ron Carpenter , who led the front four in tackles and quarterback sacks last season . The message was clear : the Bengals already had first-line players at every position . Last year 's draft had filled in the two remaining pieces of the puzzle , a wide receiver and a big running back . // Critics used to say that Cincinnati 's quarterbacks could not throw deep , but then Isaac Curtis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bombing . Curtis averaged 18.7 yards on his 45 receptions last season and scored nine touchdowns , five of which were for 50 yards or more . With the new restrictions against the bump-and-run  --  referred to as " the Isaac Curtis rule "  --  he figures to do even better . // In the 12th round of that draft , Brown finally found the type of big back he had always had in Cleveland . Tight End Boobie Clark from tiny Bethune-Cookman was converted to running back and imitated Marion Motley so well that he won the AFC 's Rookie of the Year award . Clark gained 988 yards and caught 45 passes for 347 more . Now he says , " I do n't plan to take the bumps and bruises . This time I 'm going to dish it out . " It was apparent when Boobie reported to camp that he had been dishing it in all winter . Brown had to send the team trainer through the chow line with him to watchdog his calories . // The departure of Bill Bergey , traded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WFL , left the middle linebacker job open , but the spot was quickly seized by Jim LeClair , an outside linebacker who was moved to the middle after he ignored the strike and reported the first day of practice . No one questions LeClair 's strength  --  least of all Victor , the wrestling bear , whom he pinned this spring  --  but he is not as mobile as Bergey . And while Quarterback Ken Anderson played like an old pro last year , he has only three years ' experience . If he is injured , the Bengals will be vulnerable . Anderson 's backup , Wayne Clark , could n't make the grade in four years at San Diego . // In Pittsburgh , the quarterback position is worrisome , too , although here depth is not the problem . The Steelers have Terry Bradshaw , Terry Hanratty and Joe Gilliam  --  and each wants to be the starter . Bradshaw is the incumbent and has been since he arrived as a rookie in 1970 . He has had spurts of brilliance but has never shown real consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coach Chuck Noll assured him an equal shot at the No. 1 job , but he stayed out of camp during the entire strike and fell far behind his competition in the hurry-up to get ready for the regular season . That leaves Gilliam  --  Jefferson Street Joe  --  a 23-year-old black quarterback with minimal experience who passed opponents dizzy in the preseason and was named to open against Baltimore . All three could take turns starting , as they did last year , but that is likely to produce the same lack of offensive consistency that has plagued Pittsburgh . // The 1973 Steelers badly needed depth at wide receiver , and in that regard the draft was a bonanza . In the first round they chose USC 's Lynn Swann and in the fourth round they got what may be the real steal : John Stallworth from little Alabama A&amp;M . When Pittsburgh received a film on Stallworth from his school , it carried instructions to pass it on to the other teams in the BLESTO-VIII scouting combine . The Steelers took one look and conveniently lost the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth round . Pittsburgh might have used its first-round choice for him had Swann not been available . // But if Pittsburgh 's passing game appears better , its once-powerful running game seems worse . Two years ago the Steelers led the league with a rushing average of 5.1 yards a carry . Last year that figure fell to 3.9 . Franco Harris was hurt much of the year . Now that he is presumably healthy again he has not shown the verve that won him Rookie of the Year honors in 1972 . Steve Davis , a 218-pound speedster , has taken the other backfield post from the flashy Frenchy Fuqua. // The Steelers ' forte is still defense , particularly the front line , where Mean Joe Greene , Dwight ( Mad Dog ) White , Ernie Holmes and L.C. Greenwood terrorize the opposition . Pittsburgh recorded 33 sacks last year , a figure that certainly would have been higher had opposing quarterbacks not been in such a hurry to get rid of the ball . A better indicator of the defensive line 's prowess was the 37 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football . Altogether , the Steelers forced a league-high 55 turnovers . // Second-round draft choice Jack Lambert has drawn rave reviews and could replace veteran Henry Davis at middle linebacker ; the corner-back spot vacated by John Rowser , who was traded to Denver , will be filled by J.T. Thomas , the Steelers ' first-round pick in last year 's draft . // Noll should have no trouble becoming the first Pittsburgh coach to put together three consecutive winning seasons , and his Steelers probably will battle the Bengals right down to the wire . Indeed , the division title could well be decided in the final game of the season when the two teams meet in Pittsburgh . // Not that you can ever count the Cleveland Browns out of a race . In their 28-year history the Browns have had only one losing season . A decline was predicted last year , but going into the 13th week the Browns stood at 7-3-2 , right in the thick of the division race . Then Cleveland lost its last two games  --  to Cincinnati and Los Angeles  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Browns . Last year they could not score a touchdown against Miami , Minnesota and the Giants and in one of their two games with Pittsburgh . Cleveland 's offensive line just ai n't what it used to be . Old pro Gene Hickerson has retired and most of the returning veterans are coming off surgery . The pass protection last year was the poorest in the team 's history ; as a result , Cleveland averaged 3.9 yards per pass attempt , next to worst in the league . Quarterback Mike Phipps has yet to prove that he is anything more than a bundle of unrealized potential , and his receiving corps is thin . The Browns are counting on drastic improvement from last year 's No. 1 draft choice , Wide Receiver Steve Holden , who in 1973 caught only three passes for 27 yards . // Cleveland 's ground game was equally weak , averaging 3.9 yards a crack . Leroy Kelly has been waived to Oakland , and now the thrust of the Browns ' running attack rests on the shoulders of 5 ' 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class by himself in the open field and should be an enormous asset under the new punt coverage rule , but it is doubtful that he will be able to gain substantial yardage by throwing himself into the center of the line . // The Browns ' defense is strongest up the middle . Tackles Walter Johnson and Jerry Sherk are a superb tandem and Middle Linebacker Bob Babich , fully recovered from knee surgery , gives Cleveland its best performer at that position in years . The defensive backs are much better than their 12 interceptions ( second-lowest in the league ) indicate ; they need defensive ends who can put pressure on opposing quarterbacks. // Sid Gillman 's Houston Oiler reclamation project goes on ... and on . Gillman has brought organization and savvy to the team , but someone should have given him a course in human relations . " If I can win , " he says , " everybody can hate me . I 'll give them a license to despise me if I can win . " // Oiler players do n't seem to require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of winning any football games . Gillman alienated his veterans with comments he made during the strike and then cut seven of them the day they arrived in camp , including Linebacker Paul Guidry , who had driven 26 hours straight from Buffalo . That prompted Defensive End Elvin Bethea , the team 's best player , to ask to be traded . " He 's making the whole franchise go backward , " said Bethea of his coach . // Gillman continues to trade draft choices . He recently dealt a first in 1976 and a third in 1977 for San Francisco Running Back Vic Washington . In the first six rounds of this year 's draft the Oilers had only one selection left , and that for the fourth round . Their pick , Steve Manstedt , a linebacker from Nebraska , promptly signed with the WFL . And their No. 1 draft pick a year earlier , 6 ' 8 " , 290-pound Defensive Tackle John Matuszak , left the Oilers during training to join the WFL 's Houston Texans . Litigation followed , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blocking , Houston led the league with 52 turnovers . On defense , Gillman is experimenting with a permanent type of " 53 " alignment that utilizes four linebackers and three defensive linemen . That seems strange in light of his admission that " We had the worst line-backing I 've ever seen in pro football . " But with only two wins in two seasons , things have to get better , do n't they ? Well , do n't they ?
