THE CROFTER AND THE LAIRD by John McPhee , 159 pages . Farrar , Straus &; Giroux. $5.75 . <P> Until three centuries ago , before the great clans were broken and the brutal clearance policies of the late 1700s forced Highlanders to emigrate and make way for sheep , every McPhee in the world lived on a tiny island 25 miles off the western coast of Scotland . Among them were the ancestors of John McPhee , an American writer who has been responsible for several fine books of reportage , including last year 's tennis classic , Levels of the Game . All his life McPhee had heard about Colonsay . In the spring of 1967 , taking his family along , he finally went there . <P> Romantic Past . What he found was " less like a small town than a large lifeboat , " 17 sq . mi. of moor , mountain and rock supporting 138 people , where a purely feudal society had precariously survived the advent of the welfare state . Utterly interlaced through confinement and bloodlines , the islanders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ( " When Donald Garvard 's got a bucket in him , he can be a pest of hell " ) , struggling to make a living from the land and the edges of the sea , engulfed in a romantic sense of the past that curls over and around the island like a North Sea fog . McPhee settled down in a cottage sublet from a crofter named Donald Gibbie to watch and listen . The result is a small masterpiece of penetrating warmth and perception . <P> Though Colonsay boasts only one store and a pub , McPhee writes , " things amplify . It may be the light . " The mountains seem bigger than they are , the cairns like fortresses , the people like characters out of sagas , even though they are cattle farmers , shepherds , dock keepers , postmen , laborers-sometimes a little of each . The past , running easily into the present , gives it a special meaning . Donald Gibbie , for example , worked ceaselessly to earn the equivalent of $1,500 a year . Nevertheless , being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he happens to walk past a particular pinnacle of rock that juts like a bowsprit a hundred feet above the sea , he will sometimes step out on it and stand there on one foot . His ancestors did this for long periods of time , he says , " to prove to man and nature that they were superior beings . " <P> Cloudy Future . Colonsay is an anachronism , and anachronisms are nearly always costly . The owner of the island-the " laird " of the title-is an Englishman named Euan Howard , fourth Baron Strathcona . It was his mixed fortune to inherit the place in 1959 along with the responsibility to maintain at his own expense a broad range of social and economic services . At that time the island cost 10,000 a year to keep going . Through economies , the island produce , including cattle and sea kale , is now just about able to support the inhabitants . McPhee likes Strathcona ( rather better than his tenants do ) and sympathizes with his problems . But he notes that Strathcona 's cutbacks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise to reduce the population still further . Soon there may be no more than 70 living people among the countless ghosts . Other islands-Pabbay , Sandray , Taransay , Scarba , Soay , Mingulay , St. Kilda-dot the sea round Colonsay . All were inhabited . Now all are empty .
