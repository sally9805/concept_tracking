txt The Israeli Government decided today to accept a three-month-old United . States proposal to begin negotiations with Egypt aimed at a special agreement to reopen the Suez Canal . The long-awaited decision came at a hastily summoned Cabinet meeting , just a few hours before the news that the Egyptian President , Anwar elSadat , had arrived in Moscow to coordinate diplomatic and military policies with the Soviet Union . It followed weeks of intensive discussions between the Israeli Ambassador in Washington , Yitzhak Rabin , and the Assistant Secretary of State , Joseph J. Sisco . Under the United States proposal , Mr. Sisco would act as a go-between for indirect talks between Israeli and Egyptian representatives stationed in close proximity , perhaps in the same or nearby hotels in New York . The Egyptians have long refused to meet the Israelis directly . Dubbed ' Proximity Talks ' The actual start of these negotiations  --  which the diplomats call " proximity talks " ? could still he a long way off , since American diplomats have not yet tried to obtain the approval of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel 's agreement in hand , diplomatic sources said , would the United States be ready to approach Cairo . Israeli officials expect this American initiative to be an important subject of discussion between Mr. Sadat and Soviet officials . Indeed , there is reason to believe that Premier Golda Meir called the Cabinet meeting specifically to get the Government 's decision into the open before Mr. Sadat 's talks with the Russians . Greater Trust Is Seen With the Egyptian attitude to the American-sponsored peace move still highly uncertain , the Israeli-American agreement is nevertheless significant on its own , marking a new level of confidence between Washington and Jerusalem . I Foreign Ministry officials said that the last weeks of painstaking talks in Washington had produced far greater preIcision and mutual confidence between the two countries on diplomatic procedures than at any time in the last two years . A more secure relationship of military cooperation was also defined , including an open pipeline of Phantom jet aircraft and other military supplies . The substance of the pro- posed agreement with Egypt has not been discussed with the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the two Middle East neighbors themselves to decide on actual arrangements for opening the canal and separating the two front lines . What has been worked out is a set of ground rules for negotiations that , as one Israeli official put it , " will insure that we will not be surprised by any tactic or maneuver by the American intermediary . " This has been an old grievance of Mrs. Meir and her colleagues , that ever since the presentation of Secretary of State William P. Rogers 's peace plans late In 1969 , the United States has appeared to interject its own position between Israel and Egypt and thus appear to undercut the Israeli bargaining position . Now , according to a responsible Israeli diplomat , the United States representatives , as " carrier of good offices , will attempt to bring the parties together to reach agreement , and will not become a party to the negotiations . " The United States was clearly unwilling to grant Israel a virtual veto over its peacemaking efforts , but did agree to hold " very thorough discussions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try breaking the inevitable deadlocks that will develop in the negotiations , Israeli offs : dais said . These are main points of contention that are likely to come up in the talks , Whenever they are held : View far Israeli front-line troops would withdraw from the canal edge to permit resumed Egyptian operation of the waterway , blocked since the six-day war of 1967 ? Israel is already committed to the principle of withdrawal , but has never specified a distance . Would Egyptian troops be permitted to cross the waterway to occupy positions vacated by the Israelis ? Mr. Sadat has insisted on this , Mrs. Meir has repeatedly rejected it . ( Mould there have to be a new formal cease-fire as part of the agreement ? Cairo has offered a cease-fire for a limited period , six months or a year . Israeli spokesmen have insisted on receiving assurances that there would be " no more fighting " indefinitely . ( Would this agreement be tightly linked to a comprehensive future agreement providing for a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Sinai peninsula ? Mr. Sadat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commit themselves to any specific further with-. drawal . Secretary Rogers first proposed the so-called " proximity talks " last October . While accepting the desirability of reaching a canal-opening agreement with Egypt , Premier Meir resisted the American initiative on two grounds : First , as long as the United States refused to sell Israel Phantom jet aircraft , the Israelis believed they would be entering upon negotiations at a military and psychological disadvantage . Second , at the same time as Mr. Rogers suggested new negotiations , he spelled out before the United Nations General Assembly some American ideas of what a future  --  agreement should contain ? ideas notably different from some of Israel 's positions . In subsequent exchanges . between the United States and Israel , agreement was reached on the supply of additional aircraft and other military equipment , and American diplomats reassured the Israelis that Mr. Rogers had not meant to " impose " the substance of any agreement and would not do so in the future .                @ @ @ @ @
