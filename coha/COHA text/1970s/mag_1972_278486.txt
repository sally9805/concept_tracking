Abraham Treff , 19 , was watching a newscast on TV last November when an interview with Ralph Nader came on . " I said that whatever he 's doing the average American can do , " Treff recalled . " My friends said I did n't know what I was talking about . So I said I 'd investigate the stock market . So they all started laughing and said , ' What 'll you find out about the stock market ? ' " <P> Treff found out that he could put Wall Street in an uproar . The Securities and Exchange Commission , the New York Stock Exchange and half a dozen embarrassed brokerage firms are investigating his brief fling at Naderism . He has forced the whole brokerage community to question its credit and trading procedures .

At the same time , the exchange and the SEC are both trying to determine whether the brokerage salesmen involved were so hungry for commissions that they broke a Big Board rule requiring them to " use due diligence to learn the essential facts relative to every customer . " Reynolds Securities , which handled more than $100,000 of Treff 's trades , has fired the salesman who dealt with him .
