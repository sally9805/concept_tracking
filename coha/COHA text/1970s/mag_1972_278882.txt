When members of the nine-nation Asian and Pacific Council ( ASPAC ) - gathered in Seoul last week , no one needed to remind them that their organization was rapidly becoming outdated . When ASPAC was formed in 1966 , Washington had hailed it as a bulwark of anti-Communist solidarity in Asia . In the wake of President Nixon 's trip to Peking , however , many of ASPAC 's members are now going to some lengths to play down that anti-Communist line in the hope of improving their own relations with China . <P> Malaysia 's delegate pointedly arrived for the two-day meeting a full day late . Japan carefully explained that it had accepted only because it did not want to offend its South Korean hosts . Australia sent its Minister for Primary Industry as a way of showing its desire to de-emphasize ASPAC 's political aspects .

Thailand , South Viet Nam , Australia and New Zealand .
