txt  | voice " of " Wordsworth 's healing power " ) ; but this entire defense of Wordsworth rests on the concession that there are moral and existential depths ? so central to modern experience ? which Wordsworth 's sensibility was incapable of sounding , or even envisaging . Most moderns , possessed of a more illiberal imagination than Trilling 's , are less patient than he with these incapacities . It is probably our awareness of Wordsworth 's governing limitations , the attention we pay to his untragic assumptions about man 's relation to nature , that causes us to emphasize ? as we commonly do ? the monistic philosophic assumptions on which many of his poems rest . Indeed , even some dedicated Wordsworthians among us tend to reduce his poems and the claims that can be made about their greatness to the optimistic promise found in the simplism of his " philosophy of nature " as they find it embodied in what they think of as the most representative ( most properly " Wordsworthian " ) of them . This limited reading of Wordsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later became and for some time remained : the simple Wordsworth who is " Nature 's Priest " ? Wordsworth the monist , believer in man 's natural purity ( or natural piety ) ? should not have matured ( or decayed ) , with poetical elegances , into the austere , orthodox didact , at once properly Virgilian and properly Christian . Somehow the Wordsworthian pietist complains about the Laureate 's sellout to Christian affirmation while he extols nostalgically the mild fervor of the early , unchurchly affirmation of nature 's immediacy and transcendence . Our darker contemporary spirits , however , like Douglas Bush in his essay ( which is really a majority rather than a minority report on Wordsworth ) , could very well view the later sellout to easy affirmation as but a slightly changed version of the earlier sellout to just as easy an affirmation . But Wordsworth 's assumptions are , of course , not so simplistic , nor is his view of man ? either in his natural or in his humanly unnatural dimension ? so oblivious to all that darkens our vision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanness as well as his naturalness ? that is , in the fact that man is cursed by that which he does not share with nature as well as being blessed by that which he shares with her . Even so early and unsophisticated a poem as " Lines Written in Early Spring " ? in contrast to the more singleminded nature worship of poems like " The Tables Turned " ? reveals a curious wavering between man 's involvement with nature and his separation from her .  | The " thousand blended notes " the poet hears assures us of nature 's harmony , the harmony that carries through the poem in its contrast to man 's discord ( " What man has made of man " ) which causes the poet to lament . Apparently just outside the poem , beckoning but rejected by the poet , is " the still , sad music of humanity " which was the cause of the major conversion in " Tintern Abbey . " But the poet , though human , is-for the occasion ? joined to nature . To her fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran ; And much it grieved my heart to think What man has made of man . Thanks to ? or cursed by ? his human soul , the poet is outside nature , but that soul is momentarily plugged into nature 's harmonious network . Thus his very union with nature carries with it evidence of his normal separateness from her . Nevertheless , the poem issues from the moment and the perspective of his naturalization . He speaks , then , out of an awareness of both worlds . Momentarily a part of the natural community , he can comment sadly on the state of his human community . With his soul linked to nature 's fair works , the poet must view man 's disharmony with regret . With his soul so linked , he can also sense , from the inside , nature 's blended joys . The next three quatrains treat three natural objects into which the poet , from his preferred position , reads the consciousness of joy . But the poet , as the human who is momentarily naturalized , does not totally ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He refrains from claiming , uncritically , that these objects actually feel the pleasures that his mood attributes to them . He remains one crucial step short of the indulgence of the pathetic fallacy . He claims , not that " every flower / Enjoys the air it breathes , " but only that " ' t is my faith that every flower / Enjoys the air it breathes . " Similarly , he acknowledges that he " can not measure " the birds ' thoughts , though their every motion " seemed to the poet a thrill of pleasure . " Finally , watching the twigs catching the breeze , " I must think , do all I can , / That there was pleasure there . " The " must " and the " do all I can " may merely be padding in what is admittedly a weak poem ; but they may also indicate the poet 's common-sense resistance to the extravagant imputation of self-consciousness to  | natural objects ( " mute insensate things " in the third Lucy poem ) luckily deprived of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-consciousness in the poem . The poet sees his human predicament and his more than human desire : he wants both the harmony of nature and the human capacity for self-consciousness which could experience the joy of such harmony . He does not , in the poem , deny the possibility that nature may have the harmony without being able to know it and feel it and that humanity may have the capacity to know and to feel though it brings only disharmony . The poet , his human soul momentarily linked to nature 's fair work , can ? for the occasion ? both have the consciousness and feel the harmony . Even so , it can only lead him to the further sad awareness of the human disharmony that surrounds and , therefore , must follow this moment . This awareness is also his acknowledgment that man is , after all , outside nature and shut off from her harmony . Such is the price of his self-consciousness . So , moved by the dichotomy between man and nature , the poet is scrupulous not to impute joy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which his sadness has driven him ( " I must think , do all I can " ) , as having to impute such joy , whether there is any objective basis for it or not . The poem is a subjective confession , not a metaphysical claim . Only in the final quatrain , in the hypothetical " ifs " which are the consequences of his faith , does the poet dare suggest the possibility that perhaps what he has imputed to nature may really be there : perhaps nature is holy : If this belief from heaven be sent , If such be Nature 's holy plan , Have I not reason to lament What man has made of man ? The last line is converted to refrain , now newly justified by the possibilities opened up by the hypothetical hope : " What if all that I have claimed for nature 's inherent consciousness truly was there ? Then we would have the sort of teleological construct that could insist upon harmony and consciousness ( like mine , momentarily , in this poem ) . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disharmony could be seen as a serious perversion of the natural order . For all distance between the natural and the human community would  | vanish . Domesticate the natural , make it one with us , and it can become our model instead of merely remaining that insensate " other " into which , via a pathetic fallacy admitted to be fallacious , we can read our wishful thoughts as we seek to convert an alien world into our natural home . Still , the poet , in his self-consciousness , nowhere allows his " faith " to move him beyond those final " ifs . " Clearly , we are still trapped within what , from my earlier discussions , I might call the Kantian question , that central dilemma of the earlier eighteenth century which produced the rich , added dimensions I claimed to find in Pope and Johnson . The dogmatic certainty of a rational , God-structured universe rested upon the anthropomorphic assurance that objective order truly existed out there as a comforting reflection of the rational order of the human mind , that God was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as smart as Newton . And , ranged against such security , the unavoidable skepticism of the timeridden " man of flesh and bones " prompts the Hume-like fear that our claims to objective order are just such projections of mental constructs upon the elusive , sliding , alien somethings out there , in order to reduce them to the shape and dimensions needed for our comfort as we seek to live among them . We have seen Pope and Johnson covertly concerned , in their different ways , about the possibility that the rationalist 's claim to order was not really sustained in the nature of things but was a universalizing projection of his rage for order . As subject of perception , the rationalist named his world and attributed substance to his names , though in so doing he might have been telling us more about his mind than about the objects contemplated by that mind . What if the object resisted the dogmatic impositions by the subject , its substance remaining independent of his names for it ? The Kantian alternative to eighteenth-century dogmatics acknowledges such resistance by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impose its order even as it insists that such imposition not be confused with an objective , independently grounded structure . So we have seen our eighteenth-century writers attempt to persuade themselves of a universal order while they nourish the doubt that kills ? or that would kill if the human imagination did not construct substitute ways of living with this doubt . Insecurity about the cosmic architecture threatened man with exclusion from his world . If the world did not answer to his dream , if its shape did not reflect his own inward shapings , then ? whatever it  | might be that lurked out there on its own ? it held the threat of an indifference that would leave him alienated from it . The collapse of the eighteenth-century intellectual monolith left man homeless . For the anthropomorphic claim of the naive Realist , by definition , assumed a universe that was the mirror of the human mind : mind and universe were made for one another , mind tailor-made for universe if one believed the metaphysical claim of the Realist or universe tailor-made for mind if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case it was a cozy arrangement which absorbed , one way or the other , the alienating antinomy between subject and object . But in the later eighteenth century , as the minor misgivings of a Pope or a Johnson became a major disruption , man found himself ejected from his universe . The subject , no longer certain of what forces truly ruled those alien objects around him , certain only of the false confidence into which he had been lulled , keenly felt the existential loneliness of his exile . It was not only an ejection ; it was a Fall . The loss of union between self and other was indeed the loss of Eden and the beginning of solitary wanderings in search of that subjective creation which would be a justifiable substitute for all the substance of the objective which had slipped away . The opening moments of Goethe 's Faust are an allegory of the plight of man in the exile created for him by the train of thinkers of whom Goethe 's philosophical colleague Kant was the final ? if inevitable ? instrument . Faust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty word for the full spiritual flowing of action . Weary of himself , he wants to open outward . Aware ? despite his unique triumphs ? of his common limitations , he seeks unlimited creativity . So he contemplates the sign of the Macrocosm , envying the ever-creative , dynamic harmony of nature 's organic proliferation . But , however he may wish to feel himself ? his subjective self ? in this movement , at once restless and satisfying , he remains helplessly outside , and inside himself alone . Then , less transcendentally , he turns to the sign of the Earth-Spirit , to the immanent source of the life force . He summons it and it appears . But it rejects him , denying his claim to be its peer , treats him with contempt , and disappears , insisting that it is beyond his comprehension . Faust , we recall , is discovered on the stage alone ? alone and restless ? restless with his aloneness . He is man in the wake of the eighteenth century ? both its dogmatism and its insecurity created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , man who has  | been ejected from the comfortable home in nature that his imagination tried to create for himself , ejected and unable to get back in . That nature which , in his metaphysical dogmatism , he tried to make a reflection of himself ? his peer ? now is hopelessly and frighteningly other . It is totally outside him , unresponsive , answering only its own secret sources of being , whatever ( so far as he can know ) they may be . So man , isolated in his subjectivity , has no choice but to cultivate and master that subjectivity , to create within himself and from himself his own uniquely human world , now that rapport with the natural world is to be denied him . Faust , then , must roar through experience , living it in all its varieties , always creating himself anew , until finally he vies with nature and , at last creating outwardly , he wins from the sea the land which he can convert to a human future . A newly won harmony through the subjective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost harmony in the objective that was thoroughly destroyed by Hume and Kant . Man 's striving has made the Fall a fortunate one : we have lost nature but can surpass her . If the plight of eighteenth-century man led Goethe to produce such an allegory , it also led to an analogous configuration in the philosophic work of Kant . Here too man must construct out of himself in the absence of a grounded universe , whose substructure he can not know . Hence the opposed worlds of nature and of man , the world of determinate judgments and the world of freedom . It is this opposition between nature and freedom that leads to the Kantian aesthetic of Goethe 's fellow poet Schiller . Schiller 's wellknown distinction between the naive and the sentimental clearly derives from the opposition between man in nature and man in competition with nature , from outside her . Again we have an analogy to the Fall , this time placed within the psychological history of cultures and literatures . Man begins as natural man , a part of nature , partaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies immanently within him is all of him , there is no surplus remaining to make him other than nature , to allow him to transcend or see himself as distinct from nature . The naive poet , then , is neither aware of his self nor self-consciously aware of nature as other , for there is no differentiated self to be aware of since nature contains nothing which he does not share . When the civilizing process disintegrates the naive poet 's simple sensuous unity , there follow a separation of his faculties and the birth of a discrete moral consciousness . These raise the poet  | above nature and transform him from naive to sentimental . He longs nostalgically for his lost unity , except that , now endowed with his human self-consciousness , he really wants , not the sensuous natural unity , but a higher and unattainable moral unity . And nature , the only unity available to his senses or his racial memory , must now serve as a symbol ( but only a symbol ) of the perfection for which he must strive in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of senses ) . Thus , as Schiller says , either " the poet is nature or he seeks nature . " No longer a part of nature , he tries to rediscover and return to her . But since he is now a self-conscious , moral being ? human , and , as human , more than natural as well as other than natural ? his return can not be complete , so that he must rather use nature as a symbolic reflection of what he strives toward in the realm of ideas . Nature becomes mere metaphor , imbued with moral qualities which the human in him reads into it : we are ready for the " pathetic fallacy. : ' So Schiller can say , " In proportion as nature ceases to be experienced as a subject ? we see it dawn and increase in the poetical world in the guise of an idea and as an object . " Schiller could not have put it better for our purposes here . When Faust , modern Western man toward the end of the eighteenth century , recognizes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curse and blessing of his " dreadful freedom " as human , this is the consequence . Still , for the mighty humanism of Sturm and Drang , the Fall is fortunate and full of promise . After all , Schiller himself was ready to do without the " naive " perfection of the Greeks and even Shakespeare , in order to allow for the " sentimental " strivings of Goethe . Perhaps the philosophical and psychological revolutions in the eighteenth century opened the way for us to project the Fall onto man 's sudden consciousness , at a given point in his cultural development , of his eviction from his home in nature . Whether it happened once for us all ( as in the doctrinal Fall ) or once in the development of each civilization or once in the lives of each of us , the Fall is always a fall out of nature into our sole human selves ; now outside nature 's order , we are left to develop our own , although we now have become sophisticated enough not to read that order back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Renaissance and then ? with finality ? after the valiant futilities of his Rationalist impositions , encouraged cultural mythologizing of Schiller 's sort . Indeed , closer to  | our own day , we find much the same arrangement in T. S. Eliot 's reading of the history of our poetry in terms of the " unity of sensibility " and the " dissociation of sensibility , " creating the " intellectual " as opposed to the " reflective " poet . Of course , for Eliot there is a different disposition of values , Schiller 's " sentimental " having for him become a far more unequivocal term of disparagement . But then Eliot is hardly , like Schiller , a humanistic progressive , even as his day had far less promising a future . But whichever the attitude toward man 's original unified consciousness ( thought of as an un-self-consciousness ) , the sort of development of sensibility we see in Schiller or Eliot reflects their common attempt to translate the Fall into historical terms , to place it ? or some traumatic movement analogous to it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of Western culture . In such remarkable writers as William Blake , on the other hand , the Fall from Innocence to Experience is a continual part of the historical present . It is reenacted in every individual ; it is the death-dealing force in the development of single consciousness . Here we are close to where we left Wordsworth . For him too the Fall is forever occurring , or recurring ; but it occurs uniquely for each man in the act of reorienting his sensibility . As in Kierkegaard , the trauma of shock provokes the discontinuous movement we trace from the " aesthetic " to the " ethical " stage . All of these writers ? whether they see the Fall as the organizing myth of our shared cultural history or as the central fact of the psychological coming of age of each of us ? are profoundly aware of what it costs our sensibilities to be ejected from their natural and congenial home ; they must face the bankruptcy of the factitiously secure world view , a bankruptcy that , as we have seen , terrorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wordsworth seems to combine ? or to muddle ? lamentations for a most unfortunate Fall and hope for what fallen man can create out of a fortunate Fall . We have noted Schiller 's pleasure in the gains won through the transformation from the naive to the sentimental , as man , having fallen from natural grace , can raise himself to a thoroughly human and moral grace . But a more Blakean attitude sees in the Fall only a degeneration , a falling from grace that is redeemable only by a return , a regaining of the innocent sensibility . Wordsworth seems to fluctuate between both these attitudes , sometimes even seems ? ambivalently ? to want to hold both at once .  | Should man attempt to force himself back into the harmonious perfection of his original absorption in nature , or should he attempt to realize his own higher nature as man by going self-consciously beyond his earlier state into the human , and thus the moral , realm ? Has there really been a Fall ? How literally do we mean the Fall as our metaphor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirming and denying the archetypal role of the Fall . He hesitates between the monistic view which sees nature as inspirited , with God immanently within it , and the more orthodox , dualistic view which sees an opposition between nature and the spiritual principle , with the latter outside and beyond nature . Is a God-laden nature to be always available to man as his proper home , or is man , a fallen creature now cut off from nature , to bring himself toward a transcendent God who has ordered a higher , more than natural destiny for him ? Even the early Wordsworth is divided in his allegiance to nature as he contemplates his awareness of man . What we may see as Wordsworth 's philosophical indecision serves him poetically , as he uses it to illuminate ? by way of a metaphor urged and withdrawn ? the phenomenology of the Fall and man 's multiple awarenesses of its possible applicability . It is his double awareness that justifies the many poems in which Wordsworth , by double vision , views a single place from two perspectives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as his double awareness of man 's role inside and outside nature , that supports the claim with which I began this chapter : that there is in Wordsworth a far less simple and cheerful faith than the one to which the modern mind , obsessed with its own darkness and complexity , often restricts him . So often , as we have already seen in " Lines Written in Early Spring , " any suggestion of nature 's conscious harmony is accompanied by the poet 's self-conscious acknowledgment of the possibility that his own sadly human subjectivity is reading all this into an alien , " insensate " object . So often , too , the nostalgic idyll of nature as man 's lost home , always beckoning him , is accompanied or followed by the poet 's insistence on the compensatory features of man 's new human possibilities . Again we find the Fall from nature man 's curse and his blessing , author of his woe as of his weal . To his " Intimations " ode , a poem dedicated to just this balance ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sections added later ? Wordsworth finally prefixed a note that explicitly deals with his use of the Fall . It must be granted that the  | older conservative Wordsworth , embarrassed by the heterodoxy of his suggestions about Platonic pre-existence , is attempting to reduce an apparent metaphysical claim to a metaphorical suggestion . He sees it as his mythic datum , invoked as a projection of psychological delusion . But under the apologetic note that undercuts the extravagance of the poem is his appeal to our common experience of the Fall . This appeal reveals an awareness that supports what I have been claiming here . To that dream-like vividness and splendor which invest objects of sight in childhood , every one , I believe , if he would look back , could bear testimony , and I need not dwell upon it here : but having in the poem regarded it as presumptive evidence of a prior state of existence , I think it right to protest against a conclusion , which has given pain to some good and pious persons , that I meant to inculcate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion to be recommended to faith , as more than an element in our instincts of immortality . But let us bear in mind , that though the idea is not advanced in revelation , there is nothing there to contradict it , and the fall of Man presents an analogy in its favor .... Archimedes said that he could move the world if he had a point whereon to rest his machine .... I took hold of the notion of preexistence as having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorizing me to make for my purpose the best use of it I could as a poet . What we have observed even as early as " Lines Written in Early Spring " indicates that Wordsworth 's consciousness of the human aftermath of the Fall ? his consciousness of the delusions about nature which it sponsored ? was not restricted to his later years . The poet 's humanity can not afford not to read self-conscious harmony into nature ? for his sake , not nature 's . Here is man seeking nature , in the sense of Schiller , even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . And it is Wordsworth 's capacity to create this double awareness that refutes those who underestimate the fullness of his vision . Sometimes , it must be said , his control wavers as he seeks to  | balance an imaginative indulgence and an intellectual restraint , the inward movement toward identity with the object and the hesitant withdrawal from it . He can not always manage the representation that permits him both to yield and to observe himself as yielding . He senses not only his surrender but his need to surrender , though he can not always with equal mastery persuade us of these companion , and yet opposing , pulls within him . " I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud , " a poem somewhat later than " Lines Written in Early Spring , " is the sort of partial failure I am suggesting . It has the necessary ingredients : the isolation of solitary man from the natural community , the animation of nature to the point where it seems to be aware of its communal joys , and the vain attempt of man to rejoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his imaginative reunion with it and the consoling pleasures of that act . The poet is to the daffodils as the cloud is to the peopled earth : he is alone , floating without definite purpose , far above the . gathered crowd below . " Crowd " and " host " emphasize the unindividuated , collective character of what can be seen from his ( the cloud 's ) height . ( This moment is not altogether unreminiscent of Johnson 's lofty view of mankind " from China to Peru " at the outset of " The Vanity of Human Wishes . " ) But the daffodils constitute no imperfect society . The harmony of their collective movements is insisted upon in their " dance " ; and some form of the word occurs four times in this brief poem . The poet moves quickly from the literally descriptive " fluttering " to the merest suggestion of animation in the barely metaphorical " dancing " ( " Fluttering and dancing in the breeze " ) . But he presses onward to an explicitly conscious movement which fulfills the earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance . " The waves next to them join in the dance , and nothing less than " glee " is attributed to them . They have indeed become a " jocund company , " whose gaiety must infect the poet-observer , who now , apparently , joins them ( " A poet could not but be gay , / In such a jocund company " ) . Perhaps Wordsworth is here saying that only the poet can be counted on to respond in this way : only he of the imaginative power can animate his objects , can transform them into an alive and gleeful company which he can join , thus enlightening himself through natural communion . But has the poet been taken in ? Is there any awareness here of the subjective nature of his magical feat ? Or is there actually a claim of an immanent  | spirit in nature into which man must feel himself ? Is the poet claiming that the daffodils are independently gleeful , or that his human separateness has permitted him to read glee into them ? Or has he not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unalterably separate from the natural community his lonely , cloudlike singleness has left him ? The main suggestions here have been that the poet has forgotten himself , has permitted his movement toward identity with his object to put to rest the critical faculty that would lead to his withdrawal and continuing distinctness from his object . Thus he is led to the excess , the uncritical indulgence of the final line , when solitude breaks open and flows outward to a renewed identity with nature , so that the poet forgets to remember where he is and where , for all the momentary joys of imagination , he is fated to remain : " And then my heart with pleasure fills , / And dances with the daffodils . " Is it they who have danced and still dance and who call him to them , or is it he who must have them dance so as to create a community into which his sole self can merge imaginatively ? It is disappointing that there is so much less consciousness of his role and nature 's in this poem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his couch ? can unabashedly and without reservation dance with the daffodils , we find ourselves , with some embarrassment , faced with the pathetic fallacy , naked and unguarded . And we feel closer to the charges of thinness of vision and naivete which this chapter began by recording . In as successful a poem as " To the Cuckoo , " on the other hand , we discover the poet 's need both to indulge his delusion and to show himself as deluded , to represent himself within the broader framework of the poem 's drama that contains him . He at once establishes his awareness of ? indeed , his primary concern with ? the difference between the bird as limited physical object and the bird as metaphorical source of the poet 's imaginative projections . The poet freely acknowledges the trivial and finite object he has chosen to inflate ; nor does he anywhere insist that the bird actually possesses the transcendent character he chooses to attribute to it . He begins by asking explicitly , " shall I call thee Bird , / Or but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides and of the need to choose that leads him to recognize the bird 's voice as a " twofold shout . " The doubleness of its voice makes it , metaphorically as well as literally , " At once far off , and near . " Moving " from hill to hill , " its voice echoing its presence in its absence , the bird also creates echoes within the poet 's sense of  | time . The movement from hill to hill , at once far off and near , becomes the ideal action on which to base the movement in the poet 's imagination from the fact of place to the dream of identity through time , from the here-and-now to the before-now-and-always . The bird 's voice , as I have noted elsewhere , ' is a made-to-order vehicle for the willful operation of the poetic imagination . The here and the now can be blurred into the everywhere and the always by virtue of the happy ? if lamented ? fact that the poet can not find the bird , so that he has the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of its existence . As in Keats 's famous example , if this voice and earlier voices are the same , what proof is there that they all do n't emanate from one bird ? The romantic poet is thus permitted to move from identity of sound to identity of occasion , from the assumption of a mortal , fleshly creature ( seeable even if not seen ) to a transcendent , unseeable spirit whose oneness is evidenced by the oneness of his voice ( " The voice I hear this passing night was heard / In ancient days , " " the self-same song , " " The same that " ) . Thus the operation of synecdoche ? converting the voice into the thing itself , indeed into that which transcends the thing ? allows the romantic bird-poet to use the elusiveness of the bird 's body as his excuse for willful self-delusion , for lulling himself into an easy Platonism . So it is here with Wordsworth , although no other of his rival birdpoets keeps us as explicitly aware of his awareness that he is slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneous sense of distance and nearness , absence and presence , to his open admission of his " twofold " sensing of meaninglessness and of the profoundest meanings of all . He knows that the physical bird is merely " babbling , " even as , converted through the poet 's Platonism , its voice brings to him " a tale / Of visionary hours . " The transfer is ready to be made complete , as the mortal " babbling " creature is to be rejected for the voice and all that the imaginative freedom of the poet can make it mean for him . Until now he has responded to both of the " twofold " alternatives ; now he turns wholly to the unnaturalistic one and grasps it , no longer with any common-sense qualms : " thou art to me / No bird , but an invisible thing , / A voice , a mystery . " Like Keats 's speaker in his " Nightingale , " Wordsworth 's can now move across time to insist that the voice is indeed " the same " : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " Of course , for Words2 The Play and Place of Criticism , pp. 73n. , 120-21.  | worth , unlike Keats , the sameness refers only to his own personal history rather than to the history of a culture . Thus this becomes one of the poems I spoke of earlier , in which Wordsworth 's double vision permits him to collapse time by repeating an earlier experience at a later moment , converging upon the " spot of time " from a dual perspective . In Wordsworth as in Keats , the bird , in flying and in escaping human sight , soars beyond man and human time . By flying unseen through space , it somehow ( thanks to metaphor ) flies through time , passing years or centuries like hills . Thus the spatial subsumes the temporal , the bird 's ubiquity in time reflecting its resistance to being seen in a single spot even as it is heard everywhere . The conceit is just what Wordsworth needs to merge his mature present with the " golden time " of his childhood past . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability as a child to find the bird and his untiring efforts to find her . So she was then , and has been able to remain , " a hope , a love ; / Still longed for , never seen . " The beginning of the next-to-last quatrain , " And I can listen to thee yet , " follows through on his total commitment to delusion : the " thee yet " assumes the identical bird in a continuing action unbroken since the poet 's childhood . But before the quatrain is done , something is added that does indicate a break from the " golden time " of his original experience . If the bird has n't changed , he has . The poet now must actively work , under the spell of the bird 's voice , to recreate the experience which comes automatically to the child as passive recipient . He must now " listen , till I do beget / That golden time again . " The begetting is an act of imaginative creation : the golden time , an Eden of instinctive innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , having lost it , seeks the rediscovery and the reentry . He will keep listening until finally he can make it come . But even his momentary achievement of it , though a brilliant imaginative triumph , is managed only as he acknowledges ? through the " beget " ? how artificial the merger is . Indeed , it is a tribute to the mature imagination rather than to the inspirited world of childhood ; it is a tribute that is consecrated in the very act of writing this poem to that moment and as a result of it . The present tense of the poem , with the breathless joy of discovery and participation in its final quatrain , is itself the testimony and testament of that golden time recaptured . But it testifies also to the human , imaginative effort required to redeliver oneself to nature 's primitive magic . Still these final lines are spoken out of the trance , the magical land ,  | which the poet has begotten for himself . We have witnessed the process of begetting : first the poet 's skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , then the conscious choice of that impulse , and finally the avid seizing upon the ultimate , the most dreamy consequences of the choice . His final lines come to us from that golden world he has created out of his poetic temperament ; they are his rewards for his effort and his achievement . As in " Lines Written in Early Spring , " but so much more forcefully , the poet is revealed as linked to the natural harmonies while still enjoying ? as a double advantage ? the human self-consciousness that allows him now to savor the moment as well as to have it : O blessed Bird ! the earth we pace Again appears to be An unsubstantial , faery place ; That is fit home for Thee ! There are judgments here that only the mature visionary , in contrast to an innocent existent , could make . The bird as he has created it can be termed " blessed " out of his awareness of its sacred , other-thannatural virtues . Phrases like " the earth we pace " and " appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that surrounds , in time and space , this timeless world of most un-common sense . And the word " unsubstantial " admits the price of his rapture . But his sensibility is now at the stage where the unworldly is a requirement for the enchanted bird . The bird can not have its natural , substantial place , as in the poet 's youth . If the " far off " is to be brought " near " and time is to be overcome , clearly substance itself must now be yielded up . Hence the poet 's choice of the wandering voice over the bird , the visionary tale over the babble . For the mature poet , then , the only " fit home " for the bird ? the only place where it can have existence as a bird transformed , as a transcendent union of bird and vision ? is the " unsubstantial , faery place " into which he has transformed his world . But unlike Byzantium , Yeats 's fit home for golden birds , Wordsworth 's is , in effect , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollections of childhood magic that the older Wordsworth records in that prefatory note to the " Intimations " ode from which I quoted earlier : " I was often unable to think of external things as having external existence , and I communed with  | all that I saw as something not apart from , but inherent in , my own immaterial nature . Many times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality . " In " To the Cuckoo , " in the " unsubstantial , faery place " that poem finally arrives at , we find the self-conscious fabrication ? the strenuous re-creation ? of such a moment : its glory as well as its sadness results from the make-believe character of the imagination that creates it , though that creation bespeaks the fallen nature of the creation behind it . How much less self-consciousness , how much less awareness of what the speaker is revealing about his mature and thus no longer spontaneous nature , we find in " To My Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Early Spring . " And how unfortunate an exposure the poem suffers through this uncritical self-delusion by the poet . The poem strains for spontaneity , for instant response , for a summoning of natural instinct ? almost in the manner of ( or trying to match the tone of ) a poem like Herrick 's " Corinna 's Going a-Maying . " But everything about it reveals that the poet is too stiffly arguing his sister ( and himself ) into the immediacies of feeling . He is working too hard for us to believe in his repeated desire to give himself to idleness . He summons his sister as Herrick summons Corinna , except that , next to Herrick 's sweeping dynamics , Wordsworth 's call is strained : My sister ! ( ' t is a wish of mine ) Now that our morning meal is done , Make haste , your morning task resign ; Come forth and feel the sun . The awkward parenthesis , the end-stopped lines , the inversion coupled with the unforceful Latinate verb ( " resign " ) in the third line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " These difficulties are general ones throughout the poem . There is too much care here for the spirit of reckless indulgence he wants to impart to his sister . Elsewhere also the poem is too thoughtful an expression of the antibookish ( " And bring no book " ) call to instinct over thought . It is positively philosophic . Though this is a call to idleness , emphasized by the use of the refrain , the poet is imposing a weighty metaphysical task upon his listener . He is giving her a program for feeling herself into the soothing receptivity of nature . He summons her to " the hour  | of feeling " almost as if on a schedule . Rejecting the " toiling reason , " he yet speaks of their " minds " as drinking " at every pore / The spirit of the season . " Similarly , their hearts will make " silent laws " for their own obedience . Though unlike the " joyless forms " that " regulate " the lifeless calendar of man when he is not attuned to nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more-than-natural effort . This is a good deal more than the " wise passiveness " called for by the receiver of sensations in " Expostulation and Reply . " The poet and his sister are to use this hour of feeling as a means of returning to nature 's bosom , as if they can , and without human interference . Love , we are told , moves " From earth to man , from man to earth . " There is no concern here for the human community , for the movement from man to man , the very concern that introduced the complications of " Lines Written in Early Spring . " The love is to return man , without intermediary , to the heart of things : And from the blessed power that rolls About , below , above , We 'll frame the measure of our souls : They shall be tuned to love . The return seems to require a surrender of their humanity , a hardwon loss of self that the very effort of the poem leads us to doubt . It is as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fall that has elsewhere conditioned his nostalgic attempt to reverse his movement from nature to the self-consciously human . The poem itself consists of the appeals of a denaturalized man insisting on the continuing availability to him of the instinctual life in nature 's immediacy . But the poem everywhere reveals , in the strenuousness of those appeals , how factitious that insistence is , how more than natural his summons is , how much more he is calling for than a passive " idleness . " Once the innocence of the " aesthetic " stage is lost , the immediacy of rapport with nature is lost with it , so that any return to nature must depend on the human conditions of maturity : Schiller 's " sentimental " must replace his " naive " for good . All this , Wordsworth 's more successful earlier poems accept , and with a surprising self-awareness in view of the uncritical claims of an instant return to instinct in poems like " To My Sister , " " Expostulation and Reply , " and " The Tables Turned . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable to us in its display ? through rhetoric , language , and the  | argument itself ? of the earnestness of man 's high purpose . But if we see this display so clearly , its speaker apparently does not . He remains deceived by his own call for a return to instinct , one that would strip his sister and him of their human selves . The Lucy poems , especially the third and fourth , spring from this awareness of the cost as well as the glory of man 's pre-human absorption within the natural community . That is , they are obsessed by our need to fall from nature as well as by our need to know the instinctual harmony we must forgo . " Three years she grew in sun and shower " traces the process ? and points to the consequences ? of creating an eternal child of nature . The bulk of the poem is the carrying out of Nature 's promise in the first stanza to make Lucy " A Lady of my own . " And so well does Nature , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall into being human : hence her premature death . As Nature describes the process , there is nothing in Lucy that does not come from nature as its reflection . Her response to the natural forces that form her is a passiveness neither " wise " nor even willed , but instinctive : " hers are the silence and the calm / Of mute insensate things . " It is important to recognize the full force , indeed the shocking force , of the phrase " mute insensate things " applied to Lucy as a happy comparison . It is , after all , a rather extreme characterization of her passivity as a part of nature . She clearly is to have no more consciousness ( to say nothing of self-consciousness ) than the flowers , birds , and twigs into which the poet had to project pleasure in " Lines Written in Early Spring . " Most of the poem is taken up with the several stages of Nature 's making of this lady of his own , stages constituted of successive displays of the ways in which Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these reflections . She will borrow from Nature the simultaneous obedience to law and impulse , in her innocence feeling an identity between that which kindles and that which restrains ? an identity which , for those of us fallen into experience , becomes polarized into opposition . Thus the springing sportiveness of the fawn joins with the calm hush of the mute insensate thing . The next three stanzas show her literally formed by the nature which she sees and of which she partakes as she lives intimately with it ( him ) : " The floating clouds their state shall lend To her ; for her the willow bend ; Nor shall she fail to see  | Even in the motions of the Storm Grace that shall mould the Maiden 's form By silent sympathy . " The blending of nature in her ( as in her form 's being molded " by silent sympathy " ) is beautifully created in Wordsworth 's language . Similarly , in the next stanza , changing from eye to ear , she shall so sympathetically listen that " beauty born of murmuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metaphor that creates Nature ( as a speaking , acting character ) out of nature is made to work : he concludes , in the spirit of Marlowe 's passionate shepherd in the " Come live with me " tradition , " Such thoughts to Lucy I will give While she and I together live Here in this happy dell . " Nature has made a lady of his own who has come and lived with him , and with him will stay . The speaker of the poem adds , " Thus Nature spake ? The work was done ? . " For the speaker , being human , can see only that Lucy has died . There is a shocking but bitter irony in this final stanza as we are wrenched out of Nature 's perspective and forced to view Lucy 's fate from the uncomprehending perspective of man . This concluding comment is troublesome indeed and might be viewed ironically , except for the poet 's failure to place the speaker and his lamentation within a dramatic context . So we must view it as the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the unfortunate second line ( " How soon my Lucy 's race was run ! " ) refers to the speaker , who certainly is not Nature but is rather in opposition to Nature . The very line itself , so inappropriately worded , reveals the alien perspective out of which it issues . If the datum of the poem , its central metaphor , is to be taken seriously , then in what sense can Lucy be the speaker 's ? Only Nature , whom we have watched making Lucy a lady of his own , can call her " mine . " Yet the speaker refers to her as " my Lucy " and to her death as his loss of her . And the poem closes with four self-pitying lines in which the speaker laments what has been left to him out of his loss . The lines are hopelessly human and , as such , are an inappropriate conclusion to what he has narrated . If we accept the terms of the poem , how can Lucy be lost to Nature ?  | Is Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , permanently Nature 's bride ? Perhaps Nature 's refusal to permit her to grow from a natural to a human state , thus preserving her innocence and protecting her from the Fall , has the necessary consequence of making her dead in the eyes of man . So perhaps we could not expect the speaker of the last stanza ( despite the fact that he has just related Nature 's words to us ) to understand whose Lucy she was and why he would have to see her as dead before she could ever truly become his ? and ours . Though Wordsworth gives us no sense that he is aware of the violent incongruity of perspectives between the last stanza and all that precedes it , we still can find the meaning of the poem enriched by the final speaker 's poverty of understanding . We now feel fully the price of Lucy 's natural purity and perfect innocence . If these qualities are to continue forever , if she is never to fall into mere humanity , if the natural community is always to claim all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is inevitably transformed . This poem and the one which follows are early and powerful variations upon the theme Keats 's speaker stumbles upon in " Ode to a Nightingale , " when his hope for a timeless union with the bird leads to his shocked awareness that timelessness for man is not an ideal eternity but is the brute fact of death : " To thy high requiem become a sod . " It may be , however , that the poet ? or even the speaker ? is , after all , aware of his insensibility in that last stanza and aware of the total meaning of the blissful natural creation in the earlier ones . For however we may decide about the possible alternative meanings in the much-debated fourth Lucy poem ( " A slumber did my spirit seal " ) , one thing seems certain : this is a profound confession following directly upon the speaker 's blindness as revealed in the third Lucy poem and , especially , in its final stanza . It is as if shock was produced upon the speaker at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his private human sorrow , a shock that brings about the very understanding that it tried to conceal . Thus he now sees the slumber that sealed his spirit ; and he senses that he has collaborated with that force ( Nature ? ) which would not permit Lucy to be humanized in that even he himself saw her as " a thing " ( a " mute insensate thing " ) . If she seemed to be a thing not subject to human time ( " earthly years " ) , she too ? whatever she seems to his poet 's fancy ? in reality has turned into Keats 's " sod . " And the consequences of her thinghood , which the speaker 's slumbering spirit has in part conferred  | upon her , are seen in the cold negation , the passivity , the deadness , of the overinterpreted second quatrain : No motion has she now , no force ; She neither hears nor sees ; Rolled round in earth 's diurnal course , With rocks , and stones , and trees . ' Nowhere does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alienation between the natural and the human communities . Far from suggesting the possibility of the return of the human to the natural , Wordsworth seems ready to concede the impenetrability of nature once man has fallen out of it into his own realm . It is , however , in other poems that Wordsworth dwells upon the cultivation of the human community by fallen man . Until now we have seen , in his poems the uncertainty ( or we can soften our criticism by terming it ambivalence ) of his response to the fallen human state , alternating between his acceptance of it and his attempt to get back into the natural community as he refuses to accept the Fall as irrevocable . The subliminal metaphor of the Fall is both affirmed and retreated from in these poems . But even as early as " Tintern Abbey " we find Wordsworth pressing forward from the regrets over what maturing man must lose to the compensating union he can find with his fellow fallen creatures . " Tintern Abbey " is perhaps Wordsworth 's supreme poem of the double vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cuckoo " ) of a single experience or a single place viewed from two points in time . Of course , in such poems he usually concentrates doubly on a spot rather than , as in " To the Cuckoo , " on a happening . This specialness of place permits the spatial joining of " spots of time , " as it evokes dual reactions separated in time but joined by the mature poet 's bringing to the present the present-ness of the past . So the primary vision is that of maturity , with only an idyllic nostalgia operating to bring the past 's golden time to illuminate the present . In " Tintern Abbey , " however , 3 The last word , " trees , " in the dead company of rocks and stones , is , with its organic implications , either a monumental irony directed against nature or an unfortunate oversight by Wordsworth . The poet who tried to attribute pleasure to twigs either slipped here ( in a way especially strange for him ) or is emphasizing bitterly the gap between all nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic in nature .  | the poet finds the advantage of representing both past and present responses to the scene as occurring together in the present . The presence of his sister , as a re-presenting of his own youth standing side by side with his own maturity , permits an incarnation of his original vision to be companion to his current one . And to complete the possibilities , the poet looks to the future , to his sister 's return to this spot , to the second part of her own double vision , anticipated ? or prefigured ? by his own current companionship with her . The sister , then , not only links the poet to nature through being an embodiment of his own childhood attachment to it , but , in bringing the past into the present and projecting the future out of the present , she also affirms through her presence their kinship and their history , thereby linking the poet to the history of the human family , both in and out of nature , in their own natural relations to one another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's varying attachments to nature , for it is also the history of man 's mixed attachments to nature and to man . There are in this poem actually three , rather than just two , stages in the speaker 's development , probably reflecting the often-imputed influence of Hartleyan psychology . The first two are both passive responses to nature , the first to nature present and the second to nature absent . Together they suggest the empiricist 's inevitable distinction between sensations and ideas , together with the complete dependence of the second on the first . The first is the instinctual life in nature , life totally absorbed in nature . It is an animal response , not unlike Lucy 's , the response of a being formed by his relation to nature . This response is " an appetite , " a feeling and a love , That had no need of a remoter charm , By thought supplied , nor any interest Unborrowed from the eye . ( 11. 80 ? 83 ) But " through the speaker 's long absence " in alien " towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye . Still , if only in memory , he is passively subjected to sensations sweet , Felt in the blood , and felt along the heart ;  | And passing even into my purer mind , With tranquil restoration ... . ( 11. 27 ? 30 ) The speaker is still united to nature as , led into a mystical trance , he is carried into the heart of the universe : that blessed mood , In which the burthen of the mystery , In which the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world , Is lightened .. . Until , the breath of this corporeal frame And even the motion of our human blood Almost suspended , we are laid asleep In body , and become a living soul : While with an eye made quiet by the power Of harmony , and the deep power of joy , We see into the life of things . ( 11. 37 ? 49 ) The harmony and the joy which the speaker in " Lines Written in Early Spring " tried to impose upon the natural objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , even in the absence of those objects . Indeed , his response is the more profound , the more metaphysical , as their absence prompts him to move beyond them to the essential harmony and joy out of which they come and function for him . This second stage , then , is really a development , or transposition , of the first stage : threatened by the curse of individuation , by the separation from nature induced by the Fall into human singleness , the poet yet manages to sustain his passivity as ? with the loss of self ? he is returned to the soul of nature , to the pool of being . All is immanence in nature ; there is no transcendence , no surplus , in him or in nature . But the third stage , which is the present tense of the poem , does spring from his separateness , his humanness , his awareness that his Fall from the oneness in nature is irrevocable . He clearly has surrendered the naive for Schiller 's sentimental state . Immanence yields to  | transcendence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the human community . His looking upon nature is now severely modified by his " hearing oftentimes / The still , sad music of humanity , " that which must " chasten and subdue . " The lines which follow are difficult , and probably weak in their vagueness , but that they struggle toward a transcendent something beyond the indwelling soul of nature seems evident : And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts ; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused , Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns , And the round ocean and the living air , And the blue sky , and in the mind of man . ( 11. 93 ? 99 ) The endless coordination of the " and " leads at last beyond nature to " the mind of man , " generator of " the still , sad music . " Perhaps this is the addition that permits the something to be " far more deeply interfused " ? in that strangely incomplete comparative phrase ? " more deeply " than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature short of man . The poet is awakened to this " presence , " which incorporates the human into all that must be accounted for , because he ? with his earlier sense of the self-sufficiency of nature ? has been chastened and subdued by man 's still , sad music . And man , no longer passively emptied into nature , is himself creative , self-generative . It is as if Wordsworth has incorporated Kant , as well as the sorrows of the French Revolution or his own private sorrows in France . For now nature , " all the mighty world / Of eye , and ear , " is something these senses " half create " as well as perceive . The human world now lies somewhere between the receptivity of the empiricist 's senses and the spontaneity of an active , constitutive mind . No wonder that , in proper Schiller-like language , nature can be humanly transformed to become the " soul / Of all my moral being . " Man may no longer be enveloped in nature in the secure way that produced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling " From earth to man , from man to earth . " Alienated and fallen , he can attempt to achieve an imperfect , sad harmony among his fellow fallen creatures as he works to relate man to man . II . Through the Embrace of the Natural Human Community I William Wordsworth and the Felix Culpa  | Perhaps in no poem does Wordsworth more successfully combine the aloneness of man with his union with the race and its history than in " The Solitary Reaper , " a somewhat later work . The reaper 's isolation , though in nature , is emphasized from the start : " Behold her , single in the field , " a line followed by " solitary , " " by herself , " and " alone " in succeeding lines . This aloneness is linked to the melancholy of her song . Such solitude and such melancholy occur despite her complete absorption in nature and in her natural duties as reaper . Clearly , in her stark isolation , she is not of nature , nor is her song , whose melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem the human figure thus surpasses nature in its demands upon the attention of the poet-observer . In the second stanza , the poet openly confronts the challenge of nature as an alternative subject for poetry . As if turning upon his earlier self and upon romantic poets generally , he rejects such obvious subjects drawn from nature as the nightingale and the cuckoo , even though they may be associated with far-off , exotic places . The voice of neither bird could so hold him as does this homely , human voice . Humanity , though in a natural setting and so existing almost as a part of the landscape , thus replaces nature as Wordsworth 's subject . ' For it is her humanness , her human sadness , as characterized by the song she sings , that confers upon her her preferred status . The " plaintive numbers flow " ( like human tears or the stream of human history ) either for sorrows distant in time and place ( " old , unhappy , far-off things , / And battles long ago " ) or common and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of to-day " ) . It does n't matter : the human story is one story , its history generating new versions of the same suffering . The final lines of the stanza join the past to the present evidence of " the still , sad music of humanity " : " Some natural sorrow , loss , or pain , / That has been , and may be again . " The word " natural " has an ironic ring for us here if we remind ourselves of the joy and harmony that , elsewhere in Wordsworth , accompany natural workings as a model for man . Here what is " natural " for man ( but , alas , so unnatural to the Wordsworthian world ) , what is inevitable to ' A similar substitution of the human for the natural as his preferred subject occurs in the " Westminster Bridge " sonnet , where Wordsworth replaces nature with the " City " : " Never did sun more beautifully steep / In his first splendour , valley , rock , or hill . " London may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ships , towers , domes , theatres , and temples " ) that are items in the poet 's landscape .  | man 's fallen state , is the " sorrow , loss , or pain " that is one with human history . No wonder the girl sings whatever she sings as if it " could have no ending . " The proof that her song is endless ( like , but so unlike , the cuckoo 's ) is provided by the poet 's sudden shift to the past tense , so that even now , in retrospect , it exists still , extending into the future as it comes out of the past . And it is well that her song 's " theme " is no more precisely defined for , or by , the poet . Whatever it is , he knows what it must be , as he knows that it must go on forever , essentially unchanged , whatever the names and dates . In this final stanza , the girl takes on archetypal significance . The endless nature of her song is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " o'er the sickle bending . " The lamentation over inevitable loss is echoed by her autumnal function as reaper , as ? in accordance with the conventional image of time as reaper , wielder of the sickle ? she seconds the work of nature . The implied comparison of nature 's seasons and man 's generations is accompanied by an awareness of the marked differences between them in producing joy or lamentation . Nature 's cycle and man 's are both natural , but man 's , thanks to the Fall , has its sense of loss , as irrevocable , unaccompanied by the joys of incipient return . The " maiden , " so alone , not only affirms her ties to humanity ; she has become one with its entire history . For the poet , her song has converted her labor in nature 's seasonal cycles to a metaphor relating to man 's passing generations . Seen by the poet as alone ( despite the flourishing of the natural community about her ) , she is now seen to join ? indeed to become an embodiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the poem ends , as have others we have seen , with the poet recollecting the scene in tranquility and learning from it ever anew : " The music in my heart I bore , / Long after it was heard no more . " As man has replaced nature as his subject , so the reaper functions for the poet , after the experience , in the way that ? for example ? the daffodils did at the close of " I wandered lonely as a cloud . " She is there , she is always there , humanity singing still its endless , sad song . For , having fallen , humanity is involved with death ; it is the grain cut by the reaper that will not grow again . Surely this awareness requires another consolation , a consolation more relevant to our sorrow than that held out by a metaphorical return , via pathetic fallacy , to a now alien nature . If man 's Fall from the natural  | community is irrevocable and leaves him alone , then he can discover whether something may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may un-alienate them , even if , in their union , they can do little more than make their sad music together . Of course , as with the cuckoo or the daffodils , it is ? admittedlywhat the poetic sensibility has made of the solitary reaper , rather than the girl herself , that counts . She exists out there in the landscape , as the landscape , the human landscape , and as his subject . She , then , is the existent and he is the visionary who reads her as classic existent , even as this act transforms him into classic visionary . Her existence is naive , un-self-conscious , and his placement of that existence within his vision charges it with a symbolism that grows to archetype . He is not an existent himself here , but a poet-observer only , though a poet with what Henry James called a sense for the subject . He chooses her as his subject and insists , as an imperative , that we see her this way too ( " Behold her " ) and thus share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which she is related to and distinguished from nature and her song is related to and distinguished from other possible songs . And it is by way of this vision that ? despite her own unawareness ? her solitude and her reaping and singing are made to serve , as subjects , his ( and our ) need to make her the illuminating representative of man and human history . She can , of course , so serve only in her own sublime naivete , just as her song can serve only so long as we do not understand its actual words . Thus the meaningless and the routine attain extraordinary meaning . The leech-gatherer in " Resolution and Independence " does not serve very differently . Here too there is the isolated figure , far from any of his fellow creatures , appearing almost like a part of the landscape , yet ? as seen by the poet for whom he functions crucially ? utterly human in his close bonds to his kind . The poem is clearly the poet 's and not the leech-gatherer 's ? which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a wise one . The poet , as the developing protagonist-visionary , comes to the point where he has great need of a force beyond himself to bring him to make peace with his condition . As Wordsworth tells us in the well-known letter , the old man seemed to have been placed there for him , " almost as an interposition of Providence . " But the poem itself tells this to us , in at least two places : in stanza 8 ( " Now , whether it were by peculiar grace , / A leading from above , a something given " ) , and in stanza 16 ( " Or like a  | man from some far region sent , / To give me human strength , by apt admonishment " ) . He is there , then , for what he can do for the poet , or rather for what the poet can make of him . And at first , before he speaks , he indeed seems to be a natural object , there to be seen : As a huge stone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eminence ; Wonder to all who do the same espy , By what means it could thither come , and whence ; So that it seems a thing endued with sense : Like a sea-beast crawled forth , that on a shelf Of rock or sand reposeth , there to sun itself . ( 11. 57 ? 63 ) The old man thus seems to be mere existence itself , although he will be pure human existence . We are reminded of Wordsworth 's description in his letter : " A lonely place , ' a pond by which an old man was , far from all house or home : ' not stood , nor sat , but was ? the figure presented in the most naked simplicity possible . " Here is an existent awaiting his visionary to articulate all that his existence can be made to mean . And what has the development of the poet-protagonist been , that he needs the leech-gatherer ? It is reminiscent of the movement from nature to man that we have been continually observing . The poem begins with the intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first two stanzas describing with a sympathetic , even participatory , fervor the active joys of " all things that love the sun . " The poet intrudes upon this world of nature 's bliss in the third stanza ; and his entrance signals the shift to the past tense , from the " now " to the " then " ( " I was a Traveller then upon the moor " ) . For with the human subject of experience comes recollection , the transforming of the immediacy of experience into the seeds of contemplation . At first he describes himself as partaking of the joys of nature , with the instinctual carelessness of youth ( " as happy as a boy " ) . This state requires his momentary turning away from his fallen , human state ( " all the ways of men , so vain and melancholy " ) . But , as we have been witnessing in other poems , the attempt to abandon the human for the natural state is , for mature man , a momentary delusion . So " fears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | thoughts , " all come " thick " upon the poet . He berates himself for trying to live his life as " a happy Child of earth , " as one of such " blissful creatures " as the " playful hare , " walking " far from the world " " as if life 's business were a summer mood . " In effect , the poet is chiding himself for deserting the human community for the natural community , for choosing aloneness with nature ( which alienates him from other men ) instead of alienation from nature ( which might unite him with his similarly alienated fellows ) . And he despairs over the degeneration of poets , perhaps awaiting him : those who " in our youth begin in gladness ; / But thereof come in the end despondency and madness . " No longer in youthful gladness , this poet surely has become despondent . But , thanks to the " peculiar grace " that provides him with the leech-gatherer , madness does not follow . The man 's immense age ( " The oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what first strikes the speaker , whose anxieties were rooted in the poet 's incapacity to sustain the process of aging . He is struck by the man 's " extreme old age " and by his simple there-ness , his just being there , immovable and a fixed part of the landscape , like the huge stone or the sea-beast . But what counts is that this is a man , one who has carried and carries still a " more than human weight . " When the old man speaks , his language ? despite his feebleness ? is " stately , " " above the reach / Of ordinary men , " reminiscent of " grave Livers " ( " Religious men , who give to God and man their dues " ) . The poet is moved by his firmness and his dignity , his sense of purpose together with his awareness of the apparent futility which has dogged the fulfillment of that purpose . Or has it ? Can anything inhibit his dedicated , daily pursuits ? More than his speech is like the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the routine of giving " to God and man their dues . " His first statement to the poet describes his " hazardous and wearisome " employment , pursued continually and systematically " from pond to pond , " " from moor to moor , " even as he endures " many hardships . " Momentarily infused with " human strength " and feeling himself aptly admonished , the poet yet backslides into his former human fears and despair , though now these self-torturing feelings seek the comfort the old man has begun to provide . So the poet " eagerly " renews his question , in effect asking for a second and more lasting injection of strength , of admonishment . The old man obliges and tells his story again . The only direct quotation of his words we  | are given in the poem ( the final three lines of stanza 18 ) adds to the indirect recitals an emphasis upon the futility of his task and the response of human faith to that futility : " Once I could meet with them on every side ; But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persevere , and find them where I may . " The almost redundant coupling of " yet " and " still " in the last line points up the constancy with which he must " persevere . " The not very successful gathering of leeches , agents of healing , is what ties him ? despite his apparent isolation ? to the human community . Is he not , after all , a faint echo of Johnson 's Dr. Levet ? Thus mildly and routinely ? but in his own way relentlessly ? pursuing his peripheral ( and hardly self-conscious ) function in the alleviation of human suffering ( why else leeches ? ) , the old man indeed perseveres , gathering many or gathering few , or even fewer , so long as there are more than none . This is the admonishment that provides a human response to the poet 's anxieties about " Cold , pain , and labour , and all fleshly ills . " And the old man perseveres in his talk ? his narrative that carries , un-self-consciously , his self-justification ? just as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same discourse renewed , " while the poet 's imagination is awakened " to see him pace / About the weary moors continually " ? weary and continual , though unswervingly purposeful , even when the practical effects of that purpose are diminished almost to the vanishing point . The gesture , the ritual of service to man , the tie to his race , require his constancy . So the poet thanks God for the help he has sent in the old man and , like the Wordsworth we have seen indebted either to natural or to human experiences , promises to recall this moment ? its strength and its admonishment ? as it recedes into his past and he returns to moments of a poet 's weakness and a man 's strength . But , presumably , the momentary ( present tense ) , careless , hare-like natural joys with which the youthful poet opened the poem are now behind him for good . It is just such a ritual dedication to human fidelity , for its own sake , that enlightens the pathos of the earlier poem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now old / Beyond the common life of man " who provides this dedication . The sense of the routine , of labor at once neces-  | sary and ceremonial , is provided by the poem 's slow , greatly attenuated pace . Its lengthy indirections of description and action make it almost a poem of attrition , reflecting in its movement the wearying round of the shepherd 's life on the land , as it moves toward the dissolution of the family title he has worked to preserve . Yet , after an enormous number of lines is consumed in bringing us so painfully to Luke 's departure , we should be shocked to find him dispatched to his degenerate fate in less than half a dozen lines . There must be a better justification for this gross disparity in pace than the difficulty , and irrelevance , of accounting for Luke 's change . In a poem where everything is tedious process , suddenly there is no process at all ? just a flat fait accompli . Luke falls upon evil ways in the " dissolute city " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late this sad consequence is introduced , we are to accept it as an inevitable course , a given , in the prodigal son tradition . Whether it accords with what we know of Luke or expect of him after the life he has known is not at issue ( although , as we remember from " Tintern Abbey , " the city is an alien place where it is difficult even for the most sensitive of refugees from nature to hang on ) . It is enough to say that Luke is dispensed with in this precipitate way in order to assure us that , finally , he and his fate do not count , that we are rather to concentrate on the faithful , unshakable , unchanging response of Michael to that fate . Though so deeply moved , he still can not be moved from his resolution and his dedication . The fate of Luke serves to remove all normal , common-sense meaning , all practical consequence , from Michael 's perseverance , his holding onto the bond between his son and him . It makes the conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life all the more unqualified , even as it allows the pathos in us and in the poet to respond to its purest human object . The poet , of course , is very much in this poem , entering at the start as our narrator in the role of a poet , a visionary now mature and removed from nature , though still aware of nature 's special powers to purify human relations . And by repeating , from his mature and sophisticated position , this tale ? remembered from childhood ? of shepherds of old ( " For the delight of a few natural hearts " ) , he establishes , below his own role of interpreter-visionary , the role of Michael as the un-self-conscious , the totally committed existent.  | In this tale unlocked from the narrator 's history , history itself is the major value ? human history as it is consecrated in the land and in man 's working of the land . Clearly , the value of Michael is intimately related to his own intimate relation to nature and his relative isolation from man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd mainly in those " dissolute " cities ) . But we should not make the mistake of looking upon Michael simply as man in the natural community , as man before the Fall . For his fundamental ties , his primary motives , relate not to his obligations to nature as having claims of its own but to man 's rights to work nature . He is , after all , alone in nature with his family ; and there is a strong sense of the self-enclosure of that minimal natural human community represented by that family in its historical dimension . It is the routine passage of the land from generation to generation that establishes a sacred law which guides Michael throughout and to which , even at the end , he must give at least a ritual obedience . And the land passes , carrying with it the burden of having to be worked . Wordsworth may call this " a pastoral poem , " but it is far from idyllic . These are hard-working shepherds , tending a land that needs hard work when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , we are told , " their labour did not cease , " thanks to their proverbial dedication to " endless industry . " ( Michael admits , " Our lot is a hard lot ; the sun himself/Has scarcely been more diligent than I. " ) But the work is no more than Michael 's discharging of his debt to the land , or rather to those who passed it down to him for him , in turn , to pass along . Thus the threat to the family 's continued ownership of the land is the direst that could invade his existence . Only so dire a possibility could lead Michael to send Luke away despite all risks . Indeed , Michael 's attitude to the land , as it affects the passing generations who tend it , makes the magnificently simple and significant line I earlier quoted from Tennyson ' s " Tithonus " ( " Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath " ) seem an echo of this poem . Michael speaks in much these terms to Isabel of what the sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have been toiling more than seventy years , And in the open sunshine of God 's love Have we all lived ; yet , if these fields of ours  | Should pass into a stranger 's hand , I think That I could not lie quiet in my grave . " ( 11. 228 ? 32 ) Luke 's departure is intended to lead to the ransom of the land , so that it may be passed to him with the family 's title again secure : " He shall possess it , free as is the wind / That passes over it " ? even as , we are to assume , Isabel and Michael and the older generations lie under it . The sacred bond between father and son in the poem is in part the result of just this sense of the ever-rejuvenated family , rejuvenated by the unbroken march of generations . Thus all of nature has its meaning renewed for Michael by the advent of Luke , so that with the boy " the old Man 's heart seemed born again . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? which is why the dead stop at the end of the poem , symbolized by the Sheep-fold ever unfinished , reflects the profoundest dashing of Michael 's hopes and of the meaning of his life . Michael 's speech to Luke in which he justifies sending him away even more clearly anticipates the tone and the meaning of the line from " Tithonus " that I have been using as a touchstone . As he speaks to his son , so he invokes the memory of his parents , extending the chain of lives backward as well as forward : Both of them sleep together : here they lived , As all their Forefathers had done ; and , when At length their time was come , they were not loth To give their bodies to the family mould . I wished that thou shouldst live the life they lived , But ' t is a long time to look back , my Son , And see so little gain from threescore years . These fields were burthened when they came to me ; Till I was forty years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . I toiled and toiled ; God blessed me in my work , And till these three weeks past the land was free . ? It looks as if it never could endure Another Master . ( 11. 367 ? 80 )  | The past generations lie beneath the land they worked , the present generations work on the land until it is their turn to lie beneath , while the free wind , the unbound force of nature , passes freely over it now , as it has before and will again . By sending the boy away , Michael breaks the union in labor of the generations still alive . He will now do alone , as he had before Luke 's arrival , the work they have been performing together . And Luke is to depart the fields , though he is to be protected from temptation in his absence by bearing " in mind the life his Fathers lived . " He is to be protected also by remembering the Sheep-fold , which represents the bond between them . It had been originally proposed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build it himself on the cornerstone laid by Luke before his departure . But the covenant between them , for work to be done separately before they are to come together again , involves a final provision ? unexpected even from so austerely gentle a soul as Michael ? that the father 's love for the son be absolute , that it continue to the end in spite of anything the boy might do or become : " but , whatever fate Befall thee , I shall love thee to the last , And bear thy memory with me to the grave . " ( 11. 415 ? 17 ) Michael is called upon to make good this extravagant promise , and he is of course true to his word , as true as he is to his love for Luke , which remains an absolute , uncontingent value : There is a comfort in the strength of love ; ' Twill make a thing endurable , which else Would overset the brain , or break the heart . ( 11. 448 ? 50 ) It is just this strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors " for his sheep , / And for the land , his small inheritance , " even though he must know that it is doomed , after all , to go " into a stranger 's hand . " However futile his efforts may be , now that all hopes for extending the patrimony to any additional generations are gone , he must perform what the land and the sheep demand . He  | proves his endless faithfulness to their covenant by working , " from time to time , " on the Sheep-fold , however unlikely the chances of his finishing it alone before his death and however insignificant it would be if he did finish it , in view of what is to become of his land . By now the gesture is all , and he preserves the ritual of repairing to work at the Fold " from time to time . " The furthest concession Wordsworth will make to his grief and his hopelessness , as impediments to his dedication , occurs in the lines , and ' t is believed by all That many and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a single stone . ( 11. 464 ? 66 ) For this old man , such a concession to despair is significant indeed . Yet , in withdrawing from the scene , the poet again emphasizes his persistence by repeating that from time to time , He at the building of this Sheep-fold wrought , And left the work unfinished when he died . Since seven years have passed since Luke 's departure , Michael must have been ninety-one , with no hope of finishing , so that the persistence ? however intermittent ? makes the Fold a remarkable testament of his faith , his tribute to the life he and his fathers lived . Here , in so early a poem , is a magnificent expression of natural human piety . Close enough to nature to keep human relations purified , the life in " Michael " is yet contained within a thoroughly human rather than a natural community . Man lives in constant awareness of his mortal taint : both his history and his future emphasize death and the acceptance of death . It is the awareness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nature . In the innocent state suggested in some of Wordsworth 's early poetry , the child shares nature 's immediacy as if there were no death ; and the man can will the passivity that allows him to return to nature 's bosom . The pathetic fallacy is fallacious no longer , so that nature is alive and absorbs man as he shares that life . Here is the true and simple timeless metaphor of the pastoral , the naive refusal to see human life as  | apart from nature , as having fallen out of nature . On the other hand , an awareness of the separateness of the human state must carry with it an emphasis upon the difference between the single human life and the leaf on the tree . Their wintry deaths and springtime rebirths are only analogies , alas , and not true metaphors at all . The leaf that buds next year is not the one that has just died ; and if this is of little importance to those who see leaves as interchangeable , it matters greatly when we cross over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and thus irretrievably gone . The reality principle of our lost innocence reminds us to deny the magical transference of the natural metaphor and , consequently , to press the metaphor to the point of its own absurdity . ' Each death in a fallen mankind produces an individuated sorrow within a human herd that knows its individual mortality , even as a collective sense of community presses it toward a belief in a collective , generational immortality . But , driven by time , man is not like the leaf on a tree filled with untimely joys ; he is not without the individual and the special ? though shared and common ? sorrows he both suffers and produces in others . Fallen man , alienated from nature , can through his history create a crowd , though hardly like the crowd of daffodils ? even when , like Michael , he remains close to nature still . The fact that the history of Michael 's generations is a collective human history accounts for the strength of his love and his fidelity . For his response to Luke 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the covenant which binds it . There is no moral judgment in him . This is to say that the natural human community , as distinct as it is from the natural community , is distinct also from the ethical human community which rests on moral judgment . Human sin is not to be outlawed along with the sinful agent ; rather , it is to be lived with as the very foundation of those limitations which create the human as merely human and create the history of those suffering generations . Their sad music is sung in unison for what is suffered singly and yet is endured because it has all been suffered before . The sacred bond persists despite all one may do : it exists as that which verifies mortality and the history that mortality at once permits and dooms. footnote Here is an extension and transformation of the general metaphor of the Fall which , I earlier noted , Wordsworth treated both as real and as a will-o ' - the-wisp , making it ? in the manner of Archimedes ? the " point whereon to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | What remains despite all is one 's historic role , what one owes and what ? through the ritual of never-ending routine gestures ? one never stops repaying . It is this natural human community that sustains Michael and the rest ? except for Luke , who is sent away from its sustaining powers . With its historical , generational sanctions , the natural human community holds its members within itself , preventing each of them from asserting his unique rights to what is owed him because he has suffered in singleness that which man commonly suffers . To demand special treatment , or the special right of private moral judgment , is to rebel against the natural human community in behalf of the other , more self-conscious and self-righteous community I have called ( after Kierkegaard ) the ethical . From the standpoint of the ethical , Luke would have been condemned and all fidelity to him terminated , since ? ethically ? that fidelity had to rest upon just cause in his behavior . Even his memory would be cast out into the exile ( out-cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disinterested city , where there is no history to temper moral necessity . But not so Michael , whose gentle , humane , unlimited capacity for acceptance is evident as he lives " the life his Fathers lived . " The " comfort in the strength of his love " makes everything ? any action ? " endurable . " And , like the leechgatherer , like the Dilsey-like creatures in Faulkner , Michael endures , making his gesture by toiling at the Sheep-fold " from time to time , " even though there are moments of despair when he " never lifted up a single stone . " Beyond this momentary lapse he can not go , and he never fails to work yet again ( though again only " from time to time " ) at what he can now never finish . This relaxed catholicity of acceptance , this refraining from moral judgment , is a hard-won self-denial for the classic existent . It calls for an un-self-consciousness that comes hard to the visionary ? which is why Michael only partly reflects Wordsworth , why the poet-narrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and by temperament , nostalgically looks upon Michael 's world as a blissful archaism . Still , the alienated visionary , learns from the less self-conscious existences from which he is cut off but which his poet 's calling requires him to observe ? here no less than in " The Solitary Reaper " and " Resolution and Independence . " And he chronicles the " still sad music of humanity " which he hears and partly comes to understand . The visionary , as a man trapped in dialogue , has been sophisticated by other commitments , most notably the ethical . And there is always  | for him the danger that he will confound the relaxed demands for natural human commonness in the herd with the hard insistences of ethical universality . The common need to endure what one suffers is beyond the ethical in that it requires a suspension of the very moral judgment upon which the ethical thrives . Yet , to the self-conscious sophistication of moral man , commonness translates into the universality under whose aegis judgment beckons ( with what consequences The Tragic Vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Wordsworth can slip into the ethical severity of a poem like his " Ode to Duty " almost interchangeably with the other sort of conservative restraint which we found in " The Solitary Reaper , " which serves almost as a companion piece . Using as his model a poem by Gray ( the same Gray he complained about in the " Preface " to Lyrical Ballads ) , which in its turn was modeled on a poem by Horace , and using as his epigraph an aphorism from Seneca , Wordsworth clearly has established his conservative credentials both in the style and substance of " Ode to Duty . " The first word of the poem in its opening apostrophe sets the tone : " Stern . " There is explicit distrust ? and rejection ? of actions undertaken and justified by the immediacies of instinct , the claim of natural innocence , " the genial sense of youth . " Instead , the poet invokes the dread interposition of the " Stern Lawgiver , " the implacable ethical , and delivers himself to the service of " reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers Duty 's demand of " self-sacrifice " from her " Bondman . " His freedom being " unchartered " and his " desires " springing from " chance , " he feels ? as a part of " frail humanity " ? a weariness that longs only for rest and a fixed guidance . There is no doubting the unqualified nature of the ethical and propositional firmness of the poem 's singleness of didactic intent . Wordsworth even felt obliged to omit from later editions of the poem a stanza he had earlier included after stanza 5 to introduce some note of compromise and thus to moderate his choice of the polar extreme of blind obedience in response to the extreme of blind impulse . ' " The stanza , which was omitted in editions after that of 1807 , reads as follows : Yet not the less would I throughout Still act according to the voice Of my own wish ; and feel past Doubt That my submissiveness was choice : Not seeking in the school of pride  | It should be evident that Wordsworth , in this poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative to the loss of the " aesthetic . " Once innocence has abandoned the instinctual , after the Fall has occurred , only rational and universalistic repression is left to man . The kinds of endurance suggested in " The Solitary Reaper " or " Resolution and Independence " or " Michael " simply do not exist for the speaker in " Ode to Duty , " perhaps because he has lost that other sort of innocence ? human rather than natural innocence ? required to be the Highland Lass or the leech-gatherer or the simple shepherd . Instead , he seems to trace the traumatic ? and not altogether fortunate ? leap from the aesthetic to the ethical as it is made by Kierkegaard 's now universal man . Properly , the " Happy Warrior " ? " he whose law is reason " ? may follow . The stern judgment which the poet joins " the just Gods " in delivering upon Laodamia also follows upon these convictions . Her crime derives from a refusal to surrender her private desires to the common need for human suffering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has sinned against the ethical or against the classic . Clearly , through her love for Protesilaus , she claims a unique right , the right to have the law of nature and man suspended so that her dead husband can be returned to her . She is unwilling to accept the suffering that is decreed for her , even though her husband ? in the spirit of the " Happy Warrior " ? himself chose the role that brought forth such suffering . Knowing from the oracle that he would die if he were the first Greek to touch Trojan soil , he chooses to be first . " A self-devoted chief , " he must elect to honor his obligation to his kind : " A generous cause a victim did demand " ( 1 . 46 ) . Laodamia can not do as well , and misunderstands the temporary nature of his return as well as the spiritual nature of that which has temporarily returned . For " precepts over dignified , " Denial and restraint I prize No farther than they breed a second Will more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a desire to eat one 's cake and have it too ? that may have expressed Wordsworth 's embarrassment at having come so far so fast from the spirit of many other of his poems . It seems clear that , as time went by and his conservatism hardened , he felt more embarrassment at the ambiguity of this stanza and so removed it . Whatever possible doubleness of intent the poem may have had ( and , in view of what follows to conclude the poem , one must admit that there was little even at the start ) was surely removed with this stanza .  | No Platonist , she demands that the body come and that it stay with her . Rewarded by his brief and disembodied return to her as a considerable gesture from the gods for her profound fidelity , she shows her love to be as " ungovernable " as it is " fervent . " She will not accept her role , even if all nature must alter its course to appease her desires . And she is punished : as his spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in vain exhorted and reproved , She perished ; and , as for a wilful crime , By the just Gods whom no weak pity moved , Was doomed to wear out her appointed time , Apart from happy Ghosts , that gather flowers Of blissful quiet ' mid unfading bowers . ( 11. 158 ? 63 ) Here again this later version of the poem finds Wordsworth far harsher in his judgment than he was earlier . ' The early version ' Note how gently sympathetic , for example , the following early version of these lines is : Ah , judge her gently who so deeply loved ! Her , who , in reason 's spite , yet without crime , Was in a trance of passion thus removed ; Delivered from the galling yoke of time And these frail elements ? to gather flowers Of blissful quiet ' mid unfading bowers . Or , somewhat later , there seems to be an intermediate phase , an uncertainty about her guilt and about the justness of the gods : By no weak pity might the Gods be moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lovers that in Reason 's spite have loved , Was doomed to wander in a grosser clime , Apart from happy Ghosts , that gather flowers Of blissful quiet ' mid unfading bowers . Laodamia has been successively characterized as being " without crime , " as being " not without the crime , " and as committing " a wilful crime . " From being judged gently and counted among the happy flower-gathering ghosts , she comes to be judged harshly by gods who are moved by " no weak pity " and is set apart from the happy ghosts . And the poet moves from asking us to judge her gently , to watching the gods judge her harshly , to judging her as harshly as the gods have ( by referring to them as " just Gods " ) .  | ( though already as late as 1814 ) seems closer to Wordsworth 's classic moments than to his ethical ones . Whatever her failings , he seems to prefer not to judge them so much as to place them in the collection of the ways of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and their lamentable consequences . It is for this reason that the final stanza of the poem seems far more in accord with the earlier , milder judgment ? the call to pity instead of the approval of the gods for rejecting pity as " weak " ? than with the stern verdict Wordsworth at the last leaves with us . Its first line puts Laodamia 's story and its sad ending in its place : " Yet tears to human suffering are due . " By now this is a familiar response in Wordsworth , although it is in keeping more with his classic than with his ethical moments . The Laodamia story , concerned as it is with the historic human roles of warrior and of wife and with the acceptance or rejection of those roles , somehow evokes Wordsworth 's soft understanding of what leads one to demand a singularity of treatment as well as what leads another to make his peace with the common fate . The more he returned to the poem , the more he hardened toward the inflexibility of judgment that characterizes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains , in which man mourns with his tears the " mortal hopes defeated and o'erthrown . " Man mourns rather than condemns , whatever the gods may command . And more than man so mourns . In a moving reversal of those early poems , in which man moves only in response to nature 's joy , here Wordsworth concludes by having nature shape itself in a mournful response to human suffering ( or so , at least , human faith must have it ) Upon the side Of Hellespont ( such faith was entertained ) A knot of spiry trees for ages grew From out the tomb of him for whom she died ; And ever , when such stature they had gained That Ilium 's walls were subject to their view , The trees ' tall summits withered at the sight ; A constant interchange of growth and blight ! ( 11. 167 ? 74 ) The chastening and subduing of mature , sophisticated man by the ' , ( mows of ii ncan I pericnc care difficult for Wordsworth to trace  | without falling into the ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust in instinct is gone , then obedience to reason as instituted in law summons us . But the Wordsworth I have meant to show as possessing a special value for us is classic instead : he emphasizes the merger of one 's suffering with man 's common lot rather than the self-indulgence in judging others in order to preserve one 's special privileges of lamentation . It is not often , from what we have seen , that Wordsworth succeeds in creating the classic alternative , except by inventing a naive existent ? a leech-gatherer , a Michael ? with the poet the vicarious , but still alienated , onlooker who can not quite join his subject . A striking exception is one of Wordsworth 's finest poems , the " Elegiac Stanzas " inspired by Sir George Beaumont 's painting of Peele Castle in a storm . Perhaps more than any other of his poems , this one has its meaning contained in its language and its metaphor , with a tightness of structure and a manipulation of his poetic materials that are very rare in the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recapitulation and consummation of all that we have been observing about the several moments in Wordsworth 's work . All this is achieved through the use of the poet-protagonist who needs no existential surrogate . He can be both visionary and existent because his action is symbolic only : his self-consciousness has thoroughly embedded the development of his awareness in the diffuse precision of metaphor . The poem is dominated by the use of multiple reflections and what these imply about the illusory nature of the poet 's reality . We feel ourselves almost in Plato 's world . There are reflections within reflections as we follow the poet in his pursuit of a reality in which he can rest . There is the original castle of his memory , its image in the " glassy sea , " the image of that experience in the picture the poet would have painted , and the present picture by Beaumont , which , in turn , is an image of the poet 's present state of mind . Of course , his first experience of the castle , in its static @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmarred reflection . We have a cluster of the appropriate adjectives : " pure , " " quiet , " " perfect , " " calm " ( though here it is used as a substantive ) , " gentle , " " tranquil , " " peaceful , " and again " quiet " ( though this time as a substantive ) . But this language supports subtler elements that are at work . In the fourth line , as if to emphasize the Platonic quality of the secure world of peace , the poet speaks of the castle 's " Form " " sleeping on a glassy  | sea . " Of course , the utter sameness and stillness of the sleeping Form would require the utter peacefulness of the sea . The poet could look either at the castle or at its reflection in the water and see the one " Form . " In so constant a world , he need not distinguish between reality and its image . All is sameness , apparently with no threat of change : " Whene'er I looked , thy Image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never passed away . " There is no more than the slightest ruffle of the water , and that temporary , so that the " Image " is a dependable reflection of the " Form . " The lines themselves imitate the sameness of the world : " So pure the sky , so quiet was the air ! / So like , so very like , was day to day ! " We move from redundancy to repetition , as if the sameness of words can reproduce that constant sense of stasis . The second of the two quoted lines is a series of exactly reproductive mirrors : of the nine words there are fully three pairs ( " so , " " like , " " day " ) . The like-ness of the days is demonstrated most simply but surely by the second , unvaried use of the word . The " like " to " like , " the " day " to " day , " these establish the timeless assurance of the next two lines that speak of the certainty of the " Image . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm " as " perfect , " the calm of the day , the calm of the sea , the calm of the castle 's image . Thus it is that he can then create for us the verbal equivalent of the picture he would have painted of " the Poet 's dream . " It would have been a celebration of just this " lasting ease " or " Elysian quiet . " The world of the picture would be one with " silent Nature 's breathing life . " Here , then , is a vision of that joyous harmony before the Fall such as we have witnessed again and again in Wordsworth . The world of nature represented by the sea and the creation of man represented by the castle reflect one another to the point where they are beyond distinction . This " steadfast peace " is indeed " the Poet 's dream , " but ? from the perspective of his present awareness ? no more than a dream . It is now confessed to be only " the fond illusion of his heart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which appeared so constant s Or should the poet perceive in the tremblin , , , a threat that reminds him how fragile that " Image " is , and what slight disturbance of the water will be required for it to pass away altogether ? But his assurance at this point would not permit him to acknowledge any warning of what nature must have in store for him .  | but really could last only until the peace of the water was disrupted . Here is a further extension and realization of the conceit : the identity of " Form " and " Image " in the early dream world ? an identity permitted by the use of the water as mirror ? leads to the relegation of that entire world to mere unsubstantial illusion , no more real than a world without storms . As the apparently real castle , trapped in the transience of a water image , first provoked his imaginary picture of the dream , so the actual picture provokes his awareness of the state of the real castle , now out of sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must have wiped the castle 's image off the sea ? and permanently , since Beaumont 's picture , for all its dynamics , is a fixed object . The turbulence of the world is with us for good . Yet the poet himself seems almost to have painted the picture as a reflection of his own anguish . For the storm that has come to the poet is the death of his brother , destroying in him ? also for good ? the power to create " the Poet 's dream . " This is the power , now " gone , which nothing can restore . " Time and change ? the change that works destruction ? have entered to transform his static world , although the speaker must answer the challenge with a newly earned peace of his own . Thus he has " submitted to a new control . " 9 The line " A deep distress hath humanised my Soul " must describe the process I have noted so often : the Fall from the joyous natural community to the sad human community . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially if we recall the Lucy poems ? what is to be gained out of the loss that makes us human . So , though his loss will always be fresh , and the world 's calm gone forever , he acknowledges this awareness " with mind serene . " Like the castle that " labours in the deadly swell , " amid " this pageantry of fear , " he " braves " his storm with a calm that can not be undone by the turbulence that surrounds him . Edmund Burke 's awesome and dynamic " sublime " may have replaced the placid , static " beautiful " in the world , but a newly strengthened serenity can still be achieved by man . " Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time , " the castle will not lose its constancy in the unconstancy , the utter fluidity , of the ocean ; it will not submerge its reality in the images of a momentary mirror . " If this " new control " refers to the " Ode to Duty , " Wordsworth is doing himself an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes far beyond the ethical in its classic profundity.  | And the castle must be seen as man 's creation and the embodiment of his history ( his " old time " ) . In its steadfastness , like the poet 's , it now stands in contrast to the natural elements with which it earlier existed in the harmony of like reflecting like . It is to his early self , to man isolated from his fellows ? however comfortably he may relate to nature ? that the poet bids farewell : " Farewell , farewell the heart that lives alone , / Housed in a dream , at distance from the Kind ! " The " heart " that is here being rejected is the same that earlier invented " the fond illusion , " the idyllic picture , of the opening stanzas . It is the victim of its own creation , " the Poet 's dream , " " the light that never was , on sea or land . " And it was this dream that kept the poet ? like the poet who learns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from the Kind . " Sustained by the illusion of peace and timelessness , he could not hear " the still , sad music of humanity . " The blindness to the lamentably dynamic truths of nature , as man is related to it and distinct from it , leads to a false joy . The melodramatic turbulence of the sea in the painting ? the death of his brother ? becomes the challenge of extremity , the Kierkegaardian shock , to the naive and isolated " aesthetic " state in which the poet has rested . He responds not with the self-generating fury of the " ethical " but with the calm of the classic . Not judgment , not the demand for unique treatment as one who has been wronged , But welcome fortitude , and patient cheer , And frequent sights of what is to be borne ! And sights , or worse , as are before me here. ? Not without hope we suffer and we mourn . This is no pollyanna cheeriness . The speaker has in the final line transferred at last from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sign of his recognition of the need to submerge his sorrows into ours , those common to " the Kind , " sorrows as violent as the ones pictured before him and the personal one he is now celebrating , " or worse . " Our historic role is suffering , and our historic response ? one that preserves us as human and as creatures in a continuum ? is endurance , endurance " of what is to be borne . " Here is " Wordsworth 's healing power , " of which Arnold wrote . All these poems of Wordsworth 's mature classic vision cherish that natural human community in which we discover  | what is most natural to us as man : neither identity with nature nor ? in our alienation from it ? an inflation of the self-consciousness with which we are left , but an awareness of our historic dimension which helps lose us in the human whole . Attuned to the echoes of history , we hear the sounds of those about us which help us to " frame the measure " of our private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Extenuation of Extremity George Eliot lets us know at once that Adam Bede takes place in Wordsworth 's world , a world not unrelated to Michael 's . We can note the date of 1799 in her first paragraph . But I am speaking of a more profound relevance than this . Indeed , we must start before the first paragraph , with her epigraph from Wordsworth . It is precisely the Wordsworth I have been concerned with , the Wordsworth who is aware of the Fall and who responds to it not with ethical judgment , but with the understanding warmth of the natural human community : So that ye may have Clear images before your gladdened eyes Of nature 's unambitious underwood And flowers that prosper in the shade . And when I speak of such among the flock as swerved Or fell , those only shall be singled out Upon whose lapse , or error , something more Than brotherly forgiveness may attend . The naturalness of this human community is revealed by the consistently pastoral language : " nature 's unambitious underwood , " " flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flock . " The human actors are those who have been " singled out " of the herd . In their singleness they are no longer under the protection of the " canopy " that allows the natural community of flowers to " prosper in the shade . " ( We can recall the trees in Shakespeare 's Sonnet 12 " which erst from heat did canopy the herd . " Or the flowers are like Wordsworth 's crowd of daf-  | fodils , from which the lonely , cloud-like poet was singled out . ) Those who are singled out of the flock may be seen as having fallen ( " such ... as swerved / Or fell " ) . But theirs must be a fall upon which " something more / Than brotherly forgiveness may attend . " Our response is not to be within the austere sphere of ethical judgment . Clearly , what is required is for them to be reabsorbed into the flock , to be returned to the shade , under the communal , protective canopy . Of course , we have learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not nature , although by making his community more natural than ethical he can survive as part of his crowd . At the opening of the fourth book of Adam Bede ( chapter 27 , " A Crisis " ) , Eliot exaggerates the contrast between a glorious , utterly fulfilled day in nature and the sorrows about to befall her characters on just such a day : " A merry day for the children , who ran and shouted to see if they could top the wind with their voices ; and the grown-up people , too , were in good spirits , inclined to believe in yet finer days , when the wind had fallen . " But the next sentence converts to a metaphor that is a presentiment of the bastard child to come ; and as such it emphasizes the disparity between the amoral innocence of pre-fallen nature and its transfer to a moral ? and morally imperfect ? man : " If only the corn were not ripe enough to be blown out of the husk and scattered as untimely seed . " Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on which a blighting sorrow may fall upon a man ... . There are so many of us , and our lots are so different : what wonder that Nature 's mood is often in harsh contrast with the great crisis of our lives ? We are children of a large family , and must learn , as such children do , not to expect that our hurts will be made much of ? to be content with little nurture and caressing , and help each other the more . " 1 Again the call to human sympathy , " something more / Than brotherly forgiveness , " reminds us of the need to re-naturalize the human community that admittedly has lost its oneness with nature , to make that community classic rather than ethical . Thus the mild , unassuming character of the human community within " nature 's unambitious underwood " is the classic assumption of Eliot 's Wordsworthian novel . This is the assumption she reminds us of in the introductory chapter ( chapter 17 ) to the Second Book ( " In Which the Story Pauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dutch 1 Adam Bede , Rinehart ed . ( New York , 1948 ) , p. 298 . Other citations from this edition are given in the text . The textual discrepancies in the epigraph from The Excursion ( bk. 6 ) are Eliot's.  | painting " theory of the modestly realistic novel . Not only are her characters to be represented as imperfect as they are , but they are to be the commonplace , unheroic folk whose depiction Wordsworth defended in his preface to the Lyrical Ballads . Of course , Eliot 's attitude toward their moral imperfections is to be characterized by sympathy rather than by the strictures of ethical righteousness : " I find a source of delicious sympathy in these faithful pictures of a monotonous homely existence , which has been the fate of so many more among my fellow-mortals than a life of pomp or of absolute indigence , of tragic suffering or of world-stirring actions " ( p. 180 ) . Eliot here turns explicitly from the tragic to an alternative arena of human behavior , what I have been calling the classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitive richness of the center of experience : " In this world there are so many of these common coarse people , who have no picturesque sentimental wretchedness ! It is so needful we should remember their existence , else we may happen to leave them quite out of our religion and philosophy , and frame lofty theories which only fit a world of extremes " ( p. 182 ) . But Eliot 's statements about the objects of her fictional imitation are obviously thematic as well as methodological in their consequences . Her relaxed alternative to " a world of extremes " eases man 's moral burden of judgment , transforming the universal human ethical to private human sympathy . It is thus proper that we are led into and out of this digression concerning her fictional intentions by way of her apologetic discussion of Reverend Irwine and the easy , all-accepting warmth of his human response in turning aside from the stern priestly role of judgment , of firm ethical guidance . Her defense of Mr. Irwine makes necessary the defense of her sort of novel , one which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as we move , in this candidly introspective chapter of self-conscious digression by the novelist , from the " pagan " Rector of Broxton to Eliot 's modestly realistic objectives and then back again to Mr. Irwine with a newly charitable receptivity to his lack of zealousness , we discover that our charity toward him is to be a reflection of his charity toward his erring parishioners and of Eliot 's charity to them all . The sort of tale we are being told is to arouse a relaxed moral acceptance as much in contrast with the moral fervor of the heroic novel devoted to " a world of extremes " as the " wholesome " Mr. Irwine is to his more austerely Protestant successor , " the zealous Mr. Ryde . " There is , of course , this pastoral nostalgia in  | the novel ? of time as well as of place ? for the world of Hayslope in 1799 , with the inevitable advent ( after the time of the novel 's ending ) of Mr. Ryde , and , with him , the inevitable imposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible mode of existence . The stern ethical alternative to be provided by time in Mr. Ryde is an echo of the equally zealous Mr. Roe , who already exists in the time of the novel as Irwine 's more ethically conscious , ascetic alternative ? even as the forbidding Stonyshire exists as the geographical and moral alternative to the full-living ease of Loamshire . Is it not appropriate that , in her trouble , Hetty must forsake Loamshire for Stonyshire , and that she must have her trial and almost her execution in the harshness of Stoniton ? It is the quality of Loamshire living that makes Mr. Irwine its proper pastor and George Eliot its proper chronicler : 1799 and Loamshire , the time and place for a village of Michaels . Theirs is a natural human community , an " unambitious underwood , " a " flock " with a mutually sustaining power that becomes the power to contain even its most errant member , provided he does not push his separateness from them too far , so far ? that is ? as to escape that sustaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heals all private wounds . It is the human capacity to set oneself apart , together with the communal capacity to reabsorb the alien member through sympathy , that makes these creatures more than the flock or the crowd of daffodils . Such a community needs no spiritual guide more ethically zealous than Mr. Irwine , who properly secures his role as preserver of the healing power of its communal balm . His relaxed tolerance represents a flight from the ethical with its self-assertiveness , as an earlier passage describing him makes clear : " for his was one of those largehearted , sweet-blooded natures that never know a narrow or a grudging thought ; epicurean , if you will , with no enthusiasm , no selfscourging sense of duty ; but yet , as you have seen , of a sufficiently subtle moral fibre to have an unwearying tenderness for obscure and monotonous suffering . . . . He held it no virtue to frown at irremediable faults " ( pp. 66-67 ) . Eliot joins his " subtle moral fibre " with her own , using a morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus judging him humanly rather than with " the eyes of a critical neighbour who like the zealous Mr. Roe thinks of him as an embodied system or opinion rather than as a man " ( p. 67 ) . For it is precisely such a reduction of a man to " an embodied system "  | which , in the eyes of a classic visionary , the ethical persists in achieving . For his part , Mr. Irwine answers charges made against members of his flock by his more ethically earnest parishioners in a properly Loamshire manner : " We must ' live and let live , ' Joshua , in religion as well as in other things . You go on doing your duty , as parish clerk and sexton , as well as you 've always done it , and making those capital thick boots for your neighbours , and things wo n't go far wrong in Hayslope , depend upon it " ( p. 58 ) . Here is the ultimate in the minister as non-dissenter . Instead of judging , one need only fulfill his continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communal sustenance to keep within it and under its unassuming control whatever human failings occur , as they inevitably will . It is also true that such sentiments as those of Mr. Irwine recorded here accord ? too closely for comfort ? with the Victorian " doctrine of works . " But we should not permit that shabby doctrine of youthful capitalism to detract from , or distort , the essentially communal direction of Mr. Irwine 's call to perform one 's duty , or play one 's role , within a mutually sustaining , daffodil-like " crowd , " in which the only unforgivable crime is one 's claim to a separate , privileged destiny and , with it , to a superior position from which to make a moral judgment . Nevertheless , we must not rest too easily in the bland moral comforts of the Reverend 's vision , nor should we come too close to an identity with that vision . We can note that the timing of Eliot 's digression , this pause in her story in which she apologizes for the nature of her Reverend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , Eliot feels compelled to intervene because we have just witnessed a meeting between Irwine and Arthur Donnithorne ? between the pastor-confidant and his young protege ? in which the minister has scrupulously refrained from intruding himself upon the young man 's troubled spirits . He even resists the urge to press Arthur toward the confession the young man seems to want to make . Eliot is called upon to explain and excuse such niceties as springing from other causes than his un-Christian neglect of duty : hence her digressive chapter . The fact is that Irwine 's scrupulousness proves to be enormously costly : this occasion represents the last chance for Arthur to be pulled back from the action that causes the sorrows which threaten to tear the Loamshire community apart . Yet the occasion is one which Irwine fails to seize . Arthur has come to confess to his minister in order to dispel the temptation brought upon him by Hetty ( see the explicit  | statement of his intention at the close of chapter 13 ) . But Irwine fails to act upon the signs given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly . Arthur asks a general question : ought not a man be given some moral credit if he yields to temptations that spring upon him unasked and in a surprising way that throws him off guard , and if he yields only after a hard and sincere struggle ? Irwine 's answer is prophetically precise and , especially for him , shows a stern awareness of the irrevocable consequences that make an act itself irrevocable : " A man can never do anything at variance with his own nature . He carries within him the germ of his most exceptional action . . . . Consequences are unpitying . Our deeds carry their terrible consequences , quite apart from any fluctuations that went before ? consequences that are hardly ever confined to ourselves " ( p. 175 ) . Irwine is ready to apply his considerable moral insights to Arthur and wonders whether he should . " He really suspected that Arthur wanted to tell him something . " But Arthur backs off and Irwine , though he has shown us ( and Arthur ) his keen awareness of bleak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels perhaps he should : " The idea of Hetty had just crossed Mr. Irwine 's mind as he looked inquiringly at Arthur . . . . If there had been anything special on Arthur 's mind in the previous conversation , it was clear he was not inclined to enter into details , and Mr. Irwine was too delicate to imply even a friendly curiosity . He perceived a change of subject would be welcome " ( pp. 176-77 ) . This ironic use of Irwine 's lax pursuit of his role ? as the enabling action ( or inaction ) of the near-tragedy ? should put us on our guard against an uncritical acceptance of his other-than-ethical position . Eliot herself suggests Irwine 's ministerial failure : " The opportunity was gone . While Arthur was hesitating , the rope to which he might have clung had drifted away ? he must trust now to his own swimming . " Nor does Irwine turn away from condemning himself later , in retrospect : It was a bitter remembrance to him now ? that morning when Arthur breakfasted with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a confession . It was plain enough now what he had wanted to confess . And if their words had taken another turn ... if he himself had been less fastidious about intruding on another man 's secrets ... it was cruel to think how  | thin a film had shut out rescue from all this guilt and misery . He saw the whole history now by that terrible illumination which the present sheds back upon the past . ( p. 416 ) In the light of " all this guilt and misery " to come , caused in part ? if indirectly ? by Irwine 's excessive fastidiousness , by his character as minister to a congregation of classic existents , Eliot must interrupt her story , at the very moment of his failure , in order to defend him and , along with him , the kind of novel that uses him as a major one of its voices . For Irwine 's " live and let live " attitude , in contrast to ethical austerity , is the right one for Loamshire in its routine aspect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . But this attitude is sadly wanting when the routine is disrupted through a character 's " most exceptional action . " All members of the flock , who fulfill their communal roles through performance of the common routine , then close round the threat of secession introduced by the singular and the exceptional . The routine community thus reabsorbs its errant member within its loamy richness of mutual sustenance . The evil created by the irrevocable consequences endangers the community since , by spreading to other members , it can isolate them as well . The need , then , is for the evil itself to be isolated until it can be reabsorbed into the still solvent whole , as the routine seeks to re-establish itself and its hegemony . Clearly , secrecy is the enemy of the communal , which requires a continuing shared openness in its human relations , even though that openness does carry with it the menace of spreading the evil . But it is excessive secrecy that permits the nourishing of those private dreams that lead to exceptional acts which single out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air ; what is secret can only fester by being closed in upon itself . Eliot reveals just this opposition in her use of earrings as the rather obvious symbol of an errant sexuality that leads one astray from a conscientious attitude toward one 's rightful function . Both Hetty and Bessy Cranage have a weakness for these questionable ornaments . Bessy is discovered wearing her earrings by Dinah in the early preaching scene and , after being scourged in public for them , tears them from her ears and , crying aloud , throws them down . But , presumably , she is not without them for long : when we see her at the birthday games , we learn that she " had taken to her  | earrings again since Dinah 's departure " ( p. 281 ) . It is at this point that Bessy is juxtaposed to Hetty : " Anyone who could have looked into poor Bessy 's heart would have seen a striking resemblance between her little hopes and anxieties and Hetty 's . " And Hetty , we recall , also has an addiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this addiction as well . In the first ( p. 152 ) Hetty tries on the large , gaudy , glass earrings in the secrecy of her bedchamber while she dreams luxuriant dreams of gifts from her rich lover , Arthur . In the second ( pp. 254-56 ) , again in the secrecy of her bedchamber , she once more puts on her fancy earrings for a moment , but this time ? her dreams having been realized ? they are the jeweled gold earrings Arthur has bought her to gratify her desires . In both cases she can wear them only in secret , as she nourishes her forbidden , if petty , desires in secret , hiding the trinkets away before she shows herself to her community . Here , of course , is the difference between her and Bessy , despite their common love for earrings . Whatever " her little hopes and anxieties , " as symbolized in the earrings she can not resist wearing , Bessy displays them openly . She is in no danger , even if she reverts to them after having sworn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role or her place . Rather , it is precisely her role to be the somewhat laughable , if openly culpable , village flirt . She is not likely to evade or escape that role . What Hetty nourishes in secret , on the other hand , is in sharp contrast to what the Poysers expect to make of her with her own apparent ? if somewhat grudging ? compliance . Thus she can fool the heavy , sober Adam , while Bessy fools no one . Eliot herself puts it best : " You would have been inclined to box Bessy 's ears , and you would have longed to kiss Hetty " ( p. 281 ) . Indeed , Dinah , who seemed to have so moving an effect upon Bessy , however temporarily , can move Hetty ? or even reach her ? not at all . Hetty 's first scene with the earrings occurs in the chapter , " The Two Bed-Chambers , " the very title of which emphasizes the separation between Hetty and Dinah as the latter tries to reach her . Dinah , sensing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to make herself Hetty 's confidante . But Hetty petulantly refuses to confide in her , wishes to return to secret dreams of Arthur , and drives Dinah from her , so that she is left alone to enjoy the solitude of her now sealed-off chamber . The relation between the two girls is precisely the reverse of that between Arthur and Irwine in the chapter which follows immediately ? ironically entitled " Links " ? and which contains the abortive  | interview we have already traced , for it is Dinah who is the aggressor and intruder , who presses an unyielding Hetty toward a confession Hetty 's secretiveness prevents her from making . In the following chapter of another confidence that was not quite confided , Arthur 's essentially " open , generous " nature ( p. 312 ) seeks out just such an intruding spiritual adviser , only to find Irwine too reticent to receive his intended confession . Here , then , are two critical meetings that fail , when the success of either could have prevented the sorrows which follow . If Irwine played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played her role as Arthur played his , all might have been well . But instead , the combination of advisers and advisees is such that the necessary openness can not be achieved , and the truth remains to be played out , at high cost , in the shadows ? the shadows of secret bedchambers and the shadows of the wood . The portions of the novel which trace the deeds that activate the rest of it are marked by these dramatic shifts from communal openness to alienating secrecy . The warm , homey chapter " in the cottage " is followed by the chapters ( that begin at the same time the cottage chapter does ) between Arthur and Hetty " in the wood . " These , in turn , are followed by " the return home " to the open world of the Poysers , now joined by Dinah . Evening leads to the next chapter , the separated " two bed-chambers , " and then to the ironic attempt to find " links " between characters . Whether the alienating separateness is caused by the nourishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of members of the community is threatened by that isolation . The fatal function of secrecy , and the role of the wood in fostering it , are enhanced when we recognize in Adam Bede echoes of The Scarlet Letter , published almost a decade earlier . Mere coincidence can not account for even the superficial similarities . In both cases the ruined girl is named Hester ( although we normally hear of Eliot 's by her pet name , Hetty ) , and the agents of their illicit motherhood are Arthur Dimmesdale and Arthur Donnithorne . The names could hardly be closer , even if Eliot could not resist making her Arthur the giver of the thorn . The function of the wood and of sin as the isolating elements further illuminates the second work by way of the first . Of course , the two Hesters are far more unlike than are the two Arthurs , who share a strange compound of conscience and irresponsibility . Hester Prynne must with her own strength work her way toward community despite the alien Puritan world that surrounds her , while  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her away from the sustaining world , the warmly human community , that surrounds her . The strength of a member to withstand , by a transcendent dedication , a harshly ethical community in the one case is replaced in the other by the community 's strength , which fails , however , to rescue the self-severing member , who , through weakness , " swerved or fell . " It is the element of secrecy and isolation which defeats the healthy , if routine , efforts of the natural human community and which , consequently , makes Irwine no longer an adequate pastor to meet such exigencies . This is why Arthur , as Irwine 's disciple , is endangered by the private license which only communal containment can prevent from becoming a threat to that community . Arthur 's social role as above and outside the natural working community of Hayslope ( symbolized by the position of his table at the birthday party ) leaves him specially exposed . He even lives by the wrong time ( what Mrs. Poyser calls " gentle-folks 's time " p. 147 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , traceable to the fact that she has forgotten the difference between the two times , that of the working farm community and that of the leisurely " gentle-folks . " Her turning away from the daylightsaving needs of the loamy community is a turning away from a reality in nature to the artifice of a society that does not have labor as its way of life . Thus Arthur , who does not work for a living , alone with his gentleman 's time to waste , can ? without serious or ill intent ? corrupt the shallow Hetty , whose devotion to her own way of life and concept of time is inconstant . ' Thus also he can resort to semi-deceptions , contrary to his " natural " candor , when his secret actions demand contrivances to keep them hidden . ' If Arthur 's position prevents him from finding and using his " link " to the community , Irwine 's reticence to 2 The value Eliot places on work is continually demonstrated in her admiration for Adam 's sense of craft , as it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of good work , he loved also to think , ' I did it ! ' And I believe the only people who are free from that weakness are those who have no work to call their own " ( p. 300 ) . Again the intrusion of the Victorian doctrine of works ( Carlyle 's " laborare est orare " ) is evident enough . 3 " Arthur was in the wretched position of an open , generous man , who has committed an error which makes deception seem a necessity . The native impulse to give truth in return for truth , to meet trust with frank confession , must be suppressed , and duty was become a question of tactics " ( pp. 312-43 ) .  | pry ? grounded on a trustworthy communal morality ? precludes the necessary " link " between them which could rescue the young disciple . The isolation of Arthur 's position and his lack of dedication to work put him in need of a " stony " rather than a " loamy " morality , although Irwine makes only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only through the opening possibilities afforded by " meetings " that the alienating tendencies , and their disruptive consequences , can be overcome . Indeed , there have been meetings all through , so that we may see the very fortunes of the characters in the novel as structured by them . The first meeting we witness between Adam and Arthur occurs early in the chapter " Links , " while Arthur is on his way to Irwine to seek the advice that is never given . It is a preliminary attempt at linkage , coming as it does immediately after the scene between Dinah and Hetty in " the two bed-chambers . " This first meeting is filled with unknowing , veiled forebodings of things to come and ironic failures to get certain crucial things said . It thus prepares for the next scene between them , which occurs when Adam has caught Arthur kissing Hetty . This one is a meeting as unfortunate as it was unexpected . It culminates in the fight between them in which Adam , after knocking Arthur down , still refuses to forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur 's desperate , if partly disingenuous , attempts to persuade him to do so . The two can never be further apart . The third meeting between them , in the chapter appropriately entitled " Another Meeting in the Wood , " occurs after the catastrophe , with Hetty imprisoned , with Arthur about to depart and Adam threatening to do so . Adam remains unyielding : he insists on the irrevocability of the irrevocable act and will not allow any amelioration of its consequences . But there is a slight softening as he shows his awareness of the inevitability of human imperfection , even to the point of agreeing to shake hands with Arthur and to work to make whatever is to follow ? for him and the Poysers ? less rather than more painful , for them and for Arthur . Finally , the epilogue of the novel , with its leap of the years to 1807 , finds the family at the homestead awaiting Adam 's return from his ultimate meeting with the returned , the restored Arthur . They have come together : the tear has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be managed , although its existence can never be erased . The ground for this final scene has been laid by another meeting , " The Meeting on the Hill , " in which Adam and Dinah come together . Through its meetings the novel has  | moved from the secret no man 's land of the wood to the open , highland promise of the hill . So the novel closes with the openness , the mutually sustaining warmth , and the relaxed classic acceptance that are at the heart of Irwine 's attitude and performance of his function . Arthur has been returned to a community that now , even through Adam , offers to reabsorb him . And he is returning to Irwine , we are told , who jokingly threatens to keep him under his " old tutor 's thumb . " Under the new conditions , and in view of what all have learned , Irwine can now be tutor enough , even for Arthur . But in spite of the now common acknowledgment of Adam 's earlier insistence that things can never be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong that can never be made up for " ? things are considerably better than they might have been . We close , not by witnessing Arthur 's meeting with Adam , but by overhearing the narration of that meeting as we witness Adam 's homecoming , watching him being met by Dinah , Seth , the children , with the Poysers ? symbols of the loamiest aspects of Loamshirejust " coming in at the yard gate " to complete the note of homey affirmation in the communal union . Adam Bede ends , as it began , in gracious accord with Eliot 's selfconscious intention to defend the propriety of the good Reverend Irwine , as she protects the possibility of an alternative to " a world of extremes . " The rich celebration of commonplace solidarity , with its modest muddling acceptances , thus offers a moving alternative to the extremity-driven tragic vision , as I have presented it , even as Eliot 's Hetty and Arthur ? for all their woes ? collide with a more yielding , less austere society than did Hawthorne 's Hetty and Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot does n't freely open herself to the tragic possibilities of her tale , especially through the forbidding and intransigent figure of Adam . There is , indeed , an obvious but instructive paradox at the heart of the novel : this work of classic acceptance has as its protagonist ( sufficiently central for the book to wear his name as its title ) a character whose austerity leads him toward the tragic . For all her admiration for him , the novelist and her work seem at war with their hero , struggling with him to dominate not only the tone of the story but the consequences of its central catastrophe . Adam 's stony morality , planted in Loamshire , struggles to subvert Loamshire 's ( and Eliot 's ) insistence on using its classic continuity to convert even catastrophe into comedy .  | But of course the paradox is seeming only : Eliot has well arranged matters to assure the conversion of Adam and his puritanical intent rather than his subversion of Loamshire 's ( and her ) absorptive and restorative continuity . Through Adam we observe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot . Thanks to him , we see the severe threat of the fractures of dis-continuity , with the confrontation of extremity that would ensue . The elements are there in the tale , and Adam does all he can to seize upon them at their sharpest and most painful , trying to sharpen their already thin edge so that they can cut most deeply . Against this dedication to extremity Loamshire tries to apply its blunting instruments and Eliot her extenuating devices . Thanks to the latter , the former succeed : extremity sufficiently extenuated is extremity blunted . If we recall what I saw as the tragic model in The Tragic Vision , we may be strikingly reminded of it in Adam 's actions and in the situation in which he feels called upon to so act . There is the self-righteous protagonist , ready to indict all who do not measure up to his inflexible moral standards ; and there is the immoral act which increases his capacity to break the continuity of his moral universe . After Arthur 's action with Hetty , which Adam has witnessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Adam could receive no amends ; his suffering could not be cancelled " ( p. 318 ) . " He 's not the same man to me , and I ca n't feel the same towards him . God help me ! I do n't know whether I feel the same towards anybody : I seem as if I 'd been measuring my work from a false line , and had got it all to measure over again " ( p. 324 ) . So there has been a fall , as Adam 's very name should have warned us to expect . But because he acts absolutely in behalf of the ethical , he is exposed to all the destructive risks of the demoniacal , even as he is exposed to the revelation of his own failings , which undercut his self-righteous pretensions . He discovers that he has himself fallen , and can only add to his self-indictment as he contemplates the judgment he has so freely made and acted upon . Could the tragic pattern be more typically adhered to ? Adam devotes all his moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists on discontinuity , as we have seen , turning Arthur 's act into the ethical shock that converts all his thoughts to punishment ? punishment as a form of vengeance ? as he must rethink all of his relations to others and to his community . All that he retains  | is his sense of the irrevocability of the irrevocable act ; and he resists with resentment any argument for the amelioration of the consequences of that act , not only when it issues from the defensive Arthur or from Irwine ( who may be seen as Arthur 's protector ) but even when it is made by his trusted schoolmaster friend , Bartle Massey , rock of Broxton . For any suggestion that life must still go on , and that since it must it would be better for it to go on less rather than more painfully , is to suggest a continuity from life before the act to life after it . And such a continuity the traumatized sensibility of Adam must not accept . But George Eliot has been at work undermining the profundity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and return to a life and communal values disturbed but not , in the end , totally disrupted . Eliot 's primary tactic to counter Adam 's tragic impulse is her attenuation of the action . She is forever slowing the pace , pausing lovingly over details in the routine life , luxuriating in a leisure that she seems almost reluctant to interrupt in order to get her story told . True to the Wordsworthian note she has struck from the beginning , she blunts her melodrama with the rich , if unpointed , expansiveness of her lingering descriptions . Much in the way that " Michael " deserved to be called a poem of attrition , Adam Bede is a novel of attrition ? and with many of the same effects . It is probably because of this anti-melodramatic , leisurely pace that we find the arrival of Arthur with a last-minute reprieve for Hetty ? embarrassing at best ? especially unforgivable . There are also precise ways in which Eliot 's " deliberate speed " works against Adam 's reckless ardor . For example , how cunningly Eliot contrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hetty is limited to his witnessing their kiss . Upset as Adam is , insistent as he is about re-evaluating all human relations , nevertheless he still has witnessed only a kiss and suspects only an annoying flirtation . It is not until much later , when so much of his capacity for dismay has already been spent , that he learns the full extent of Arthur 's villainy . Had he learned the entire story at once ? had he discovered Hetty 's pregnancy when he first discovered anything amiss at all ? he would have responded with a violence beyond the possibility of eventual reconciliation . Instead , as Eliot has it , angry as Adam is , he can try to return to his hopes of marrying Hetty , though doubts engendered by the scene he has witnessed already exist within him . What if  | he had been engaged to marry her , and was without suspicion , when the entire truth about Hetty and Arthur broke in upon him ? What possible extenuation of his tragic response could then have been invented ? Far more useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far less likely to serve Adam 's tendency to make a total rupture out of a single action , to make every fall into the Fall . But , as I have suggested , Adam also ? in accord with the tragic pattern ? is not without guilt , a guilt that must affect his insistence on the purity of moral judgment . If Arthur falls , Adam himself ? true to his name ? has fallen in the course of the novel , indeed , even before Arthur does . But here too Eliot manages to diminish the intensity of Adam 's awareness . And again it is by attenuating the process by which he becomes aware that Eliot blunts the consequences of that awareness . It is very early in the novel that the resentfulness Adam feels toward his irresponsible father brings him close to wishing that father dead . Indeed , in retrospect he assumes the guilt of having done so . The act which later brings him remorse occurs while he is working on the coffin which his father had neglected to make before he went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place , Adam must perform ? a sacred task . There is in Loamshire a classic , ritual need to celebrate death as well as life and thus to bury the dead with propriety . So Adam insists that , despite his father 's truancy , the coffin must be ready though he may have to work through the night : " What signifies how long it takes me ? Is n't the coffin promised ? Can they bury the man without a coffin ? " ( p. 39 ) . While he works , Adam proceeds to make a self-pitying , self-righteous statement to himself about the burden his father is to him : " Nay , nay , I 'll never slip my neck out o ' the yoke , and leave the load to be drawn by the weak uns . Father 's a sore cross to me , an 's likely to be for many a long year to come " ( p. 47 ) . Just then the rap at the door ( " as if with a willow wand " ) and the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that someone is dying at the very moment when his complaint about his father 's longevity was on his lips . As Adam comes upon his father 's body the next day , on the return home after delivering the coffin , he recalls guiltily that moment of his grudging thoughts and the mysterious rap at the door : " This was what the omen meant , then ! And the grey-haired father , of whom he had thought with a sort of hardness a few hours ago , as certain to live to be a thorn in his side ,  | was perhaps even then struggling with that watery death ! This was the first thought that flashed through Adam 's conscience " ( p. 51 ) . It is as if , through the resentment he uttered the night before , it was his own father 's coffin that he had been symbolically constructing . From this point onward Adam should be disqualified from making any harsh and unyielding judgment of others , since for such judgment self-righteousness is a prerequisite . Yet this self-realization has occurred well before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer an ethical shock . Nevertheless , though it does not prevent him from pressing his rigid claim , it does undercut his right to make that claim as absolutely as he does , so that Eliot can simply call upon him to disqualify himself as a righteous judge whenever she needs him to . And so Adam does , in his own good time . In this way Eliot again has provided herself with the means to soften the hard consequences of her tale of moral villainy derived from weakness : by softening the hardness of Adam 's inflexible response . It is also true , however , that the shock and consequences of Adam 's realization of his guilt are weakened by his not making self-conscious use of them until much later , when his inflexible response to Arthur 's behavior has already been allowed to develop . Indeed , after Adam 's first instinctive reaction to his father 's death and to his sense of complicity in it , no effective use is made of this moment in what follows in the tale . Adam is no Ivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is permitted by Eliot to give full rein to his angriest reactions to what Arthur has done , while she keeps his self-knowledge in reserve to make use of when she has to soften him . During the funeral service for his father , Adam does summarize his judgment of his own austerity in a way that Eliot can allow him to return to whenever she wants him to move toward flexibility . But once the occasion of the funeral has led him to make this judgment of himself , no use is made of it that might have prevented Adam from swinging so rudely and recklessly into recriminating action . Adam 's confession to himself should condition his future actions , but even he sees that his hardness may be incurable : " Ah , I was always too hard , " Adam said to himself . " It 's a sore fault in me as I 'm so hot and out o ' patience with people when they do wrong , and my heart gets shut up against ' cm , so as I ca n't bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough there 's more pride nor love in my soul , for I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th ' hammer for my father than bring myself to say a kind word to him . And there went plenty o ' pride and temper to the strokes , as the devil will be having his finger in what we call our duties as well as our sins . Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was easiest for myself . It 's allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still , but the real tough job for me ' ud be to master my own will and temper , and go right against my own pride . It seems to me now , if I was to find father at home to-night , I should behave different ; but there 's no knowing ? perhaps nothing ' ud be a lesson to us if it did n't come too late . It 's well we should feel as life 's a reckoning we ca n't make twice over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was the key-note to which Adam 's thoughts had perpetually returned since his father 's death . " But despite the pitiless introspection of this passage , in it we are warned not to expect any change in him as a result of what his excesses have led him to see in himself . And he is as good as his word : his reactions to Arthur will be as self-indulgent , as absolute , as if there were no questioning the absoluteness of his own self-righteousness . Still , although it does not impede his actions as a would-be tragic existent , Adam 's self-consciousness is there to be tapped when Eliot is ready to start him on the road toward his healing and , with that healing , toward a partial restoration . His third meeting with Arthur , discussed above , marks the first significant change in him . Hefty 's trial is over ; she has just ( in the previous chapter ) been saved from death by the absurdly melodramatic appearance of Arthur on his horse , reprieve in hand ; and she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a continual and agonizing reminder of the irrevocability of the recent past . Consequently , in order to render a visible tribute to that irrevocability , the Poysers are to leave Hayslope , and Adam with them . Here is the way to make the disruption of the community permanent and most painful : by uprooting the most soundly rooted of the communal elements that gave Loamshire its  | meaning ( " to leave the place where they have lived so many years ? for generations " p. 477 ) . It is this horrifying prospect , destructive of the entire world of the novel as the trauma of discontinuity is erected into a final cause , that Arthur is out to prevent when he meets Adam . And they meet at the very beech tree in the wood where their traumatic meeting had occurred eight months before . Even before Arthur appears , Adam thinks of him and the beech tree and of that prior meeting , but thinks of him in a way that confirms the utter discontinuity : " at this moment , there was a stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had believed in before he had come up to this beech eight months ago . It was affection for the dead ; that Arthur existed no longer " ( p. 475 ) . The conversation that ensues between them seems a replay of quarrels that Adam has been having with Irwine , with his old teacher Bartle Massey , with anyone who tries to persuade him to lighten rather than darken the already catastrophic effects of recent events . Invariably , Adam sees such arguments as attempts to erase Arthur 's villainy and pretend it had never occurred ; and invariably his interlocutor insists that only an insatiable and irrational desire for vengeance would drain every ounce of bitterness out of the events and would turn away from even the slightest hope of sweetening the aftertaste of the admittedly poisonous draught . The same debate takes place between Adam and Arthur : the latter pleads that no one but him leave the community , that Adam not permit the Poysers and himself to be uprooted . At once Adam rejects the suggestion , seeing it as a way of deriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Adam sees in his words " that notion of compensation for irretrievable wrong , that self-soothing attempt to make evil bear the same fruits as good , which most of all roused his indignation " ( p. 477 ) . And Arthur responds , like the others , by accusing Adam of " trying to make the evil worse . " At this point something occurs which begins Adam 's turn toward the possibility of amelioration . Arthur , unknowingly , hits at Adam 's weak spot in a way that , at last , initiates the thaw : " Perhaps you 've never done anything you 've had bitterly to repent of in your life , Adam ; if you had , you would be more generous " ( p. 479 ) . Out of Arthur 's hopeless certainty about the strong Adam 's moral perfection , he has accidentally spoken the very words needed to arouse Adam 's awareness of his considerable imperfections . He has blundered into  | the sort of suggestion of common guilt that worked so successfully for the shrewdly machinating " Gentleman Brown " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And , though unintended , it works here too , as Adam 's concession reveals : " It 's true what you say , sir : I 'm hard ? it 's in my nature . I was too hard with my father , for doing wrong . . . . I 've known what it is in my life to repent and feel it 's too late : I felt I 'd been too harsh to my father when he was gone from me ? I feel it now , when I think of him . I 've no right to be hard towards them as have done wrong and repent " ( p. 480 ) . And Adam relents . There is nothing here that he has not known before ; even the terms of his confession are similar to the words hundreds of pages earlier . But now , after the lapse of time during which he has done the things he has known he had no right to do , these words belatedly begin to affect his behavior . Once again the drawing-out of the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and against Adam 's tragic impulse . He now at last offers to shake Arthur 's hand , and he acknowledges that the less painful way may after all be the more unselfish way . He is almost generous as he agrees to stay and persuade the Poysers to stay . " God forbid I should make things worse for you . I used to wish I could do it , in my passion ; but that was when I thought you did n't feel enough . I 'll stay , sir : I 'll do the best I can . It 's all I 've got to think of now ? to do my work well , and make the world a bit better place for them as can enjoy it " ( p. 482 ) . So he will allow Loamshire to work its healing powers upon him . Despite the self-pity of the passage in its suggestion that from now on his can only be the joyless service of others , Adam himself finally is one of those who can enjoy the world 's improvement which he here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironic note in the conclusion ( so often criticized for its saccharine flavor ) , since Adam , in ending up with Dinah and those splendid children they have together , is clearly far better off than he would have been with Hetty had none of the sordid events of the novel transpired . His turning toward amelioration for others certainly leads to an ultimate amelioration for himself . Of course , what makes it possible is the healing workings of Loamshire communal magic . And it works on Dinah too . Torn between her religious vocation and her desire to minister as wife to Adam , she chooses her historic role in the human community over her zealous missionary role . It can be said that she truly has moved from Stonyshire to Loamshire . It is in terms of these warmly human  | pressures to embrace all ? from Dinah through Adam to Arthur ? under the Loamshire canopy that the conclusion of the novel , despite our reservations , can be said to be earned . When Adam acknowledges to Arthur his excessive desire for vengeance while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irwine 's earlier judgment , delivered in words of warning which , prior to the third meeting with Arthur , Adam had chosen to ignore ? or , worse , to reject : " you have no right to say that the guilt of her crime lies with him , and that he ought to bear the punishment . It is not for us men to apportion the shares of moral guilt and retribution . We find it impossible to avoid mistakes even in determining who has committed a single criminal act , and the problem how far a man is to be held responsible for the unforeseen consequences of his own deed , is one that might well make us tremble to look into it .... If you were to obey your passion ? for it is passion , and you deceive yourself in calling it justice ? it might be with you precisely as it has been with Arthur ; nay , worse ; your passion might lead you yourself into a horrible crime . " ( p. 433 ) It is precisely this possibility ( so similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads Adam toward the edge of tragic existence ? and away from the compromising middle of existence represented by Loamshire classicism . And Eliot throws her weight ? the weight of the pacing and structure of her plot ? in support of the attempts of Loamshire to contain the dangerous tendencies of Adam , and thus to gain Arthur into the bargain . We can now retrace the ethical and anti-ethical modes , the tragic and anti-tragic poles , set loose and controlled in the novel . If man has fallen out of the " insensate " perfection of nature 's community , he falls either into the ethical human community ( Stonyshire ) or the natural human community ( Loamshire ) . The ethical human community sees man as opposed to nature ( and to his own nature ) , as the moral principle in self-conscious , struggling opposition to the spontaneity of the natural principle . It is the veil of universals without the  | protective canopy . The human-as-ethical is thus the antagonistic alternative to the natural : man rejects the Fall . Such a community is exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The natural human community , on the other hand , accepts all of nature in man , even his fallen nature . It is a natural human community also because it views man 's destiny through the pastoral metaphor , seeing in the life of communal man the analogy to growth and death in nature 's seasonal generations , in the manner of Ecclesiastes . Such a vision of continuity , classic or choral , can unite man with the flock , with the crowd of daffodils , without losing his special destiny as man , man who both creates and suffers his history . It is the canopy without the veil . In this way the community , in its historical depth , is at once natural and human , a community of Michaels : Loamshire . Close to nature and responsive to nature 's demands on man , Loamshire is still human and thus responsive also to man 's demands upon man , primarily upon his sympathy , a sympathy that may require the suspension of ethical judgment . Nature as nature can be joyous , while man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into sorrows that require human sympathy since they occur within nature 's indifference . For while nature as nature is perfect , man is fallen , with only his herd to sustain him and his fellows in their common fallenness . Human evil can be kept from spreading by the healing , sustaining action of the community that accepts it as necessary but works to lessen its consequences . It is only when man separates himself from that community and nurtures the consequences of the acts of fallen man that evil is compounded . There is , then , the state of nature , no longer available to man ; there is the sympathetic bond of a commonly fallen human herd that minimizes the consequences of the Fall , mitigating the inevitable suffering caused by those who fail the community ; and there is the isolated creature who secedes from the community in order to maximize those consequences . Thus it is the second fall , the fall from the community of fallen humanity , that creates the sorrows of history which the community must absorb . We have seen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Irwine 's failure to be an adequate minister to Arthur stems from his Loamshire nature and can be made up for so long as Loamshire is given time to do its healing work . On the other hand , both Arthur and Adam fail their fallen community by denying it , consciously or unconsciously , its historic rights . Arthur , insufficiently  | joined to it since he is not part of the community of labor , is free ( since Irwine refrains from binding him ) to secede from its obligations by claiming for himself unique privileges that deny his bond to his fellows . And Adam , instead of joining a communal effort to reabsorb Arthur , stands alone in claiming his own right ? as the uniquely injured party ? to set Arthur apart for special and unforgiving condemnation . Arthur 's human frailty has permitted his fall ; and the herd , understanding its commonly fallen nature , must seek to lessen the consequences of any single fall from it by preventing it from spreading among other members who can be singled out . Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethical judgment , recognizing the ethical sense of justice to be a disguised form of the fury of vengeance . But Adam must insist on the ethical , thereby creating grave danger to the entire community as well as to himself . He is willing to secede to exercise his unique right to condemn , thus seconding Arthur 's secession instead of counteracting it . Irwine is thus correct to warn that Adam is on the verge of committing a worse crime than Arthur 's . It is the sort of crime that occurs repeatedly among the protagonists in The Tragic Vision . So Adam 's crime in the novel is not the half-spoken wish that coincides with his father 's death . This only establishes him as part of a commonly fallen humanity , like the rest of us . But this act finally ( and Eliot 's purposes require that it take too long a time ) works upon him to keep him from committing the more singular , the more egregious crime against the community in its effort to sustain itself . The secession from communal sympathy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single man ? always to be expected ? can be suffered so long as the historically ordained agency for human sympathy remains intact . But the withdrawal from community to claim one 's unique rights , even ? or especially ! ? the unique right to judge and punish , can lead to those unique vices of which Plinlimmon warned Melville 's Pierre . Such ethical austerity would harden Loamshire into Stonyshire , and freeze Hayslope into Snowfield , when Dinah , by the end of the novel , is to show us that the movement ought to be the other way . But perhaps we should add that the date and archaic rural flavor of the action of the novel suggest that Eliot is only too aware , nostalgically , that classic existence is becoming an anachronism . Fortunately , Eliot has plotted to allow Adam to draw back just in time , although surely- - in defeating and subduing Adam 's tragic propensities - she has had the help of those Loamshire stalwarts the  | Poysers , Bartle Massey , and of course the steadfast Irwine . Not , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been had the events of the novel never occurred . To absorb is not to erase . To the extent that an evil act is irrevocable , Adam 's insistence on our ethical need to judge is itself justified . But to the extent that its consequences can be softened , Irwine 's insistence on communal absorption through sympathy should prompt our resistance to judgment . Despite the sweet comforts of the conclusion , clearly we are to see the suffering as continuing , even if its form has changed and its pain is somewhat covered over . Perhaps our discomfort with that conclusion is our sense that the transformed pain is not evident enough . As Arthur tells us in almost the final lines , he never was able to do anything for Hetty , who has by now been put conveniently out of the way for good ? neither he nor anyone else . Which is perhaps why there was nothing left for Eliot except to kill her off if the novel was to achieve as much reconciliation as she wanted it to . Still , the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end ? and beyond . It is for this reason that Arthur in the end acknowledges the justness of Adam 's insistence on the irrevocability of the act . But all that surrounds this final moment ( especially , as we have seen , Adam 's good fortune in Dinah ) insists on the likelihood of its consequences being ameliorated . So , as Arthur acknowledges the justness of Adam 's claim , Adam 's entire story acknowledges the justness of Irwine 's claim and , with it , Arthur 's attempt to make things less rather than more painful . By the end , as detractors of the novel have claimed , things are too close to being downright pleasurable . George Eliot has certainly beaten off the tragic alternative with a vengeance . As for Adam himself , Eliot gives us the most authoritative word on him when she describes his return to his work and to the communal routine after Hetty 's trial and Arthur 's departure : For Adam , though you see him quite master of himself , working hard and delighting in his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow ? had not felt it slip from him as a temporary burthen , and leave him the same man again . Do any of us ? God forbid . It would be a poor result of all our anguish and our wrestling , if we won nothing but our old selves at the end of it .... Let us rather be thankful that our sorrow lives in us as an indestructible force ,  | only changing its form , as forces do , and passing from pain into sympathy ? the one poor word which includes all our best insight and our best love . Not that this transformation of pain into sympathy had completely taken place in Adam yet ; there was still a great remnant of pain , and this he felt would subsist as long as her pain was not a memory , but an existing thing , which he must think of as renewed with the light of every new morning . But we get accustomed to mental as well as bodily pain , without , for all that , losing our sensibility to it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease to imagine a condition of perfect ease as possible for us . Desire is chastened into submission ; and we are contented with our day when we have been able to bear our grief in silence , and act as if we were not suffering . ( pp. 497 ? 98 ) Of course , this is his state prior to Hetty 's death ( after which her pain will be a memory and no longer an existing thing ) and prior to his marriage to Dinah and the semi-idyllic state of the epilogue . Perhaps Eliot 's desire for Adam to move further , from pain to sympathy , accounts for her finishing Hetty off as well as allowing the marriage . Nevertheless , the quoted passage indicates that Eliot does not want us to ask too much of Adam 's restoration or of Loamshire 's capacity to re-found itself . And Arthur 's final words as well as Arthur 's precarious state of health reinforce our sense of the lingering sorrow . Of course , the persistence of regret is offset by those who surround Adam upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loamshire prediction that Arthur will " soon be set right in his own country air " ( p. 550 ) . The pains of the fall persist , though some of those who have fallen manage to get up again , even if they do not quite rise . We have , after all , come through catastrophe even as we have advanced with Adam to the very edge of that destructive , tragic chasm . George Eliot has revealed her awareness of all the urgent drives that lead toward it as well as the comforts of retreat . But it is a retreat that has its modest gains , providing we can convert ourselves into choral man , whose history has earned him the right to sing sad songs with a communal joy .  | Postscript : The Naive Classic and the Merely Comic PRIDE AND PREJUDICE Before turning from works that embrace the natural human community , I should deal briefly with an example or two that take this communal sense too much for granted , that assume it as a given , never essentially challenged . These should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have seen Wordsworth and Eliot earning their way to the dream of a communal home only as they retreat from an extremity whose presence is real and whose threat is both immediate and profound . But what follows in this discussion is a mere postscript to those awarenesses we have seen fully achieved , as we now witness communal attachments that are not seriously enough questioned . It is a blessing and an unfreighted joy to have the private world at once translated into communal values that are instantly available . But we can have such a joy only as we retain a naivete which need not confront the dialogue that we have from the first seen as framing the fully aware classic vision . To retain this naive unawareness of tragic as well as classic alternatives ( as I have defined them , of course ) is to retain the comic sense unimpeded by the darker concerns that force the comic to be shaded into the comic-as-classic . And it is the latter only that should be the proper business of this book . Nevertheless , a glance just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merely comic , if only to establish it as our limiting case , may be more than a digression ; it should indeed be helpful . It is in a context thus qualified that I mean to introduce Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice . I want to emphasize those aspects of the novel that inhibit any profound challenge to the acceptance of  | community and its values . And there are a variety of effective ways in which Austen prevents her game from being an open one , susceptible of going either way . Her cards are so wonderfully stacked that we either do not recognize that they are or prefer them that way . The hope , the expectation , and the thwarting or accomplishment of marriage are the most serious problems the novel deals with . They provide the obstacles to be overcome ; they are the disturbers of tranquillity and the creators , in turn , of further tranquillity . And the moment we are persuaded to accept these as the world 's major difficulties , we are affirming the primary values of Austen 's middle-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced to manners and manners are the means for " making it " ? by way of a desirable , or at least a suitable , marriage ? is a world which precludes any serious challenge . The revolutionary impulse , momentarily alive in Wickham , is subdued before it can attain any vigor , as Wickham is revealed to be a fool as well as a cad . On the other side , the bitterness of an alldenying cynicism , keenly pointed up in Mr. Bennet , is sharply undercut by the more usefully applied intelligence of Elizabeth , who reveals the serious moral consequences ( in this world of manners ) of such unconstructive negativity . The modesty of plot is echoed in the modesty of theme . The slightness of the obstacles to be overcome for Austen 's characters to achieve their comic denouement is but another way of talking of the ease with which ? for all the apparent difficulties ? the desirable marriages can finally be accomplished and the intelligent and responsible continuance of this society assured . From the first page the major question to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it shortly becomes clear that this resolution hinges on that other question which more warmly concerns us : whether Elizabeth is to marry Darcy . Very little , if anything , occurs in the novel which is not directed to these resolutions . We observe the multiple probabilities in favor of or opposed to the happy conclusion of our hopes ( and the Bennets ' ) and see the elimination ? sometimes gradually , sometimes by pauses and leaps ? of all the probabilities but those needed to tie matters up neatly and satisfactorily . There is also the almost too proper five-act structure , as we move several times from the Bennets ' home to the visits away from home , where the two daughters can be displayed without the handicap of their undisplayable family . Austen needs to get them away from their home and she does , though they alternate  | travels with returns home , so that we can measure their gains and losses each time they re-establish their unhappy family routine . Thus Elizabeth , on whose fortunes Jane 's fortunes clearly depend , ventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , almost climactically to Rosings , and climactically to Pemberley . At each step obstacles of sentiment are cleared away and rivals are removed , each time only after affairs look darker than ever , so that the least likely becomes likely indeed . Of course , until Pemberley new obstacles and new rivals seem to arise , and even after Pemberley the short-range threat of the Lydia-Wickham affair looms over Elizabeth and Darcy , although that affairs turns out to expedite rather than prevent the desired conclusion . For a while , Pemberley seems to be another Rosings , with family ties turning a promising situation into one darker than it had been . But if Rosings turned out to be a false climax , Pemberley turns out to be a false anti-climax ? and the proper climax , happily . In this careful way , Austen works her simple structural magic , bringing always closer to realization the marriages she works to manage , even as their probability appears to diminish . There is a structural irony , close to the Aristotelian peripeteia , behind this procedure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . We have observed how Austen manages her incidents so that , while they seem to be moving in an unfortunate direction , they are actually preparing to veer around to the opposite and desired direction . This tendency is enhanced by the separate frustrations of the intentions of individual characters , so that what their actions bring about is precisely what it has been their purpose to avoid and what they fail to bring about is precisely what they have worked for . But it is to Austen 's comic purpose to use these incongruous relations between expectations and fulfillment to get her people to perform their proper social roles . The reversals of intention work against whatever would isolate the individual and , instead , work to bring him into his place in the patterned social fabric . It is as if , for all his resistance , the individual is snapped into place by the concatenation of events . Neither intellectual cynicism nor rebellious or secessionistic tendencies can withstand the pull of that fabric which has the complicity of Austen 's plot-engineering to ensure its intactness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events prior to our story ; and even the mock-sinister challenge of Wickham is turned to reinforcement as he too is snapped into place . Whether this fabric is but a  | flimsy veil fronting for an unstable psychological reality ( which events in the novel might occasionally lead us to suspect to be the case ) is , finally , not a possible question in the world of Austen ' s tale as she creates and disposes of it . There is nothing flimsy about this social fabric : it resists any tear that might reveal another , less manageable kind of reality behind or beneath it . The story is dominated by a single major reversal : Elizabeth 's desire to alienate Darcy prompts her to that behavior and those tactics which turn out to be the only way she could have won him . Similarly , her desire to escape her situation leads to those travels which are required to bring her into the midst of it and , in a way , to transform it . ( We must remember that she consents to go to Pemberley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darcy is not to be there . ) The behavior of the comic villains follows a similar pattern . We can easily observe how each effort of Miss Bingley to discredit Elizabeth and to improve her own standing in Darcy 's eyes ends by working in Elizabeth 's favor . Or there is the final , ironically enabling act of Lady Catherine , who comes indignantly to Elizabeth with an imperious demand on behalf of her own daughter 's chances ; it is this demand that tells Elizabeth what she must know about Darcy 's continuing intentions toward her in spite of the Lydia-Wickham affair . Further , Lady Catherine 's report to Darcy of Elizabeth 's attitude during their unhappy interview gives him the hope he needs . ( Austen directs us to the reversal of intention : " unluckily for her ladyship , her effect had been exactly contrariwise " from what she intended ; or , " Lady Catherine 's unjustifiable endeavors to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts " ; " Lady Catherine has been of infinite use . " ) Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidification of the marriage it seemed to threaten . Elizabeth regrets telling Darcy about the runaway couple , certain that this confidence has caused her to lose him , but this allows him to act in a way that not only saves Lydia and Wickham but permits a far more satisfactory union between the couple which is our central concern . Nor are matters different when we observe the relation between the Elizabeth-Darcy match and the other central one between Jane and Bingley . The latter involves two docile creatures to whose union the only obstacles could be external , imposed by meddlesome or malevolent or misconstruing intruders , so that only external clarification ? of the sort that could permit the Elizabeth-Darcy marriage ? can remove  | the impediments . So the match between the simple folk depends on the internal resolution of that turbulent opposition between the complex couple . This dependence of the one match on the other is so managed that the forcing of Bingley away from Jane early in the story ( which seems to doom any future for Elizabeth and Darcy as well ) clears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may blossom ? in spite of both principals ? into marriage , the very marriage required for the Jane-Bingley marriage to come to pass after all . One could look at endless details and find that the pattern is consistent . Structural ironies are everywhere , and everywhere they appear to defy the very expectation they are really fulfilling : just the combination of the surprising and the probable which Aristotle originally prescribed . Austen 's comic purpose turns everything to social advantage , so that the reversals seem both to disguise and to facilitate our subliminal awareness of a society that always claims its own in the end . There is in them a suggestion of teleological inevitability as the fabric is woven into a wholeness that permits no ripping away . So it is also that Austen 's very concern with perfection of form ? a small and modest form that arranges minor obstacles and minor victories over them ? reflects her un-self-critical classic vision . It is as if she is , in my terms , a classic existent rather than the classic visionary who is trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple awarenesses . For any major challenge , or even any possibility of profound provocation , would threaten her entire structure , thematic as well as formal . It is in this sense that I have found her special use of reversal to be the device which enables her to ensure safe management of both theme and form . The individual is not permitted to produce a crisis : consequently there can be no " either/or " except as a romantic extravagance pursued by fools or frauds and exposed by events as misleading fancies . Events work to undo the minor frailties or follies of errant individuals , and to undo them in the interest of overriding social good sense . Thus works the comic reversal , the fortunate irony that insists on setting things straight by snapping even recalcitrant characters back into their soundly functioning roles . It is the diminished sense of serious freedom in the individual , resulting from Austen 's inexorable reliance on the action of the novel to put its characters into place , that predisposes her to deal with characters whose inner life is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties of handling someone like Darcy . Thus the often-noted structural imperfections of Pride and Prejudice ? next to works like Emma , for example ? derive in large measure from Austen 's problems with Darcy and are instructive enough to justify our dealing with this novel instead of her less flawed ones . Darcy must appear to be prideful enough at the start to provoke Elizabeth 's prejudice , so that she is prepared to believe the worst of him in his relations with Wickham ; and he must be gentle enough ? indeed , must be shy almost to the point of humility ? for Elizabeth to warm to him from their meeting at Pemberley onward . Austen 's difficulty in working this transformation stems in large part from her inability ever to take us inside Darcy 's consciousness , as she freely takes us inside Elizabeth 's . We can not see him react from within , so that we find so radical a change hard to credit . There is no question about the facts when Elizabeth learns at Rosings that she has morally misjudged Darcy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but we never are sure of the facts concerning his pridefulness . Clearly , as we have already seen , the meetings at Rosings and Pemberley are the two peaks in the action , the first functioning as a false climax , while the second truly removes all the major obstacles between Elizabeth and Darcy , with only the minor seeming obstacle of the Lydia-Wickham escapade needed to resolve matters thoroughly . In the matter of Elizabeth 's judgment of Darcy , it is at Rosings that she learns of the falseness of Wickham , which eliminates all moral charges against Darcy and establishes his decency in her eyes . But his insufferable pride of manner , revealed by the nature of his proposal and his admission that he was the principal cause of Bingley 's defection from Jane , persists as a sufficient reason for Elizabeth to reject him . This objection is removed at Pemberley , but only in an unfortunately ambiguous way . At the crucial moment , before Elizabeth sees Darcy for the first time at Pemberley and in order to prepare her for the changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounters the splendid housekeeper Mrs. Reynolds , whose testimonial concerning Darcy is to be persuasive . Suddenly , here on his own princely estate , the realities are changed : it is the estate of a prince charming , which is pretty much what he will be when he shows up . Mrs. Reynolds , " much less fine , and more civil " than Elizabeth had expected to find her , maintainer of Darcy 's tasteful home ( " neither gaudy nor uselessly fine " ) , denies  | that Darcy is proud or ever has been . Indeed , speaking for all his tenants and servants , she finds him ideal in all respects , even if he is occasionally diffident . Elizabeth confesses to herself that this " commendation " " was of no trifling nature . What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant ? " 1 At this very point along comes Darcy himself to match Mrs. Reynolds ' description in all details of his behavior , however much he seems at odds with the earlier Darcy whom Elizabeth and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fairy-tale hero , utterly receptive to the Gardiners ( acting here as Elizabeth 's parent-substitutes , a more acceptable variety of her family ) , even rescues the damsel in distress , gets Lydia married off and the Bennets off the hook , all for the love of his lady fair . What , then , does Austen want us to make of Darcy ? In the context of her attempt at middle-class social realism , how are we to accept this sudden transfiguration of the priggish snob into an archetypal romantic hero ? Are we to believe in Mrs. Reynolds ' Darcy and reinterpret everything we have seen about him , or are we to believe that the events of the novel have forced him to change radically his nature as well as his behavior ? It is clear that Austen leaves ample evidence to support both hypotheses and does not herself seem to choose between them , even though they would appear to be mutually contradictory . Is it possible that Darcy has really been modest all along and that his actions have been misconstrued ? We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darcy himself has spoken of his awkwardness and shyness with strangers ( in his conversation with Elizabeth and Colonel Fitzwilliam in chapter 31 ) , as if to help Austen account for the difference between his early behavior in a new and alien company and his later behavior on his home ground . Also , Elizabeth herself corroborates Darcy 's claim that Jane did not openly show her feelings for Bingley , so that Darcy 's pressure on Bingley to withdraw had more than only snobbish motives . She corroborates also the scandalous behavior of her family as coming close to deserving Darcy 's scorn . And we have seen Darcy 's equal willingness to feel shame when his highly placed aunt , Lady Catherine , reveals her " illbreeding . " So his judgment is based on a keen and refined sensibility , not on a sense of class . Consequently , when Elizabeth shows up at Pemberley accompanied by the Gardiners , who live by trade ( though footnote ' Pride and Prejudice ( Oxford : Oxford University Press , 1929 ) , p. 239 . All text quotations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agreeable " and she is " an amiable , intelligent , elegant woman " ) , Darcy is cordial and responsive , thereby surprising Elizabeth , who had been convinced that he would treat them contemptuously . So again he seems to have reacted to the person rather than to the social position . The Gardiners , who have seen the Pemberley Darcy but not the Netherfield Darcy , of course sense no pride in him , and become trustworthy witnesses to Mrs. Reynolds ' Darcy . Perhaps Austen is putting her seal on this interpretation of Darcy when she writes of Georgiana Darcy 's behavior toward Elizabeth and Mrs. Gardiner that it was " attended with all that embarrassment which , though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong , would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved " ( p. 256 ) . Surely these words about the Miss Darcy whom we had been for so long expecting to be so forbidding are to rub off on our judgment of her brother as well . But of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job in the Netherfield portion of the novel too well for us to be able to accept Mrs. Reynolds ' notion of an unchanging , never-proud Darcy . And she knows it . Though she has sought , in the ways noted , to support Mrs. Reynolds ' version , she also permits herself to plant a chain of evidence supporting a Darcy who was indeed rather insufferable but who has changed , thanks to the power of love and Elizabeth . His own confession to Elizabeth at the end presupposes just this notion of his initial insufferability : " I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . As a child I was taught what was right ; but I was not taught to correct my temper . I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . Unfortunately an only son ( for many years an only child ) , I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves ... allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! What do 1  | not owe you ! You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous , By you , I was properly humbled . " ( p. 357 ) This confession describes just the fellow whom Elizabeth found innocent of wrongdoing but guilty of injurious pride at Rosings . So her erroneous judgment concerned only his prior actions but not his current behavior , which , to satisfy her , would have to undergo the seachange we find taking place in the magic air of Pemberley when , with Mrs. Reynolds ' introduction , he is converted into the kindly fairy prince . His confession , then , is Austen 's safeguard in case , initiated into a shrewd social realism by her steady eye and pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that Austen 's own weakness for Darcy has led her to build in occasional supporting evidence for that theory . Still , her own uncertainty about Darcy leads Austen to undercut her chain of evidence . I earlier cited the conversation among Darcy , Elizabeth , and Colonel Fitzwilliam ? in which Darcy speaks of his diffidence with strangers ? as part of Austen 's attempt to bolster what will be Mrs. Reynolds ' Darcy ; it was also a preview of our first sight of Georgiana Darcy , in whom shyness was mistaken for pride . But we must also note in this conversation that , when Elizabeth asks why Darcy , " a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers , " his cousin , the honest Fitzwilliam , says , " It is because he will not give himself the trouble " ( p. 170 ) . So Austen permits us to take the passage as we will : we can see Darcy 's words as preparation for the Pemberley Darcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or we can see Fitzwilliam 's caustic addendum as that which converts those words into an insincere rationalization for pride in a man greatly in need of being changed . Long before Darcy 's confession to her , Elizabeth herself seems to recognize a total change in Darcy with his first words to her at Pemberley , " his civil inquiries after her family " : " Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted , every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment . . . . when he spoke , his accent had none of its usual sedateness " ( p. 240 ) . It has been just this " accent " that characterized the early , stuffy Darcy . There originally was in it a  | stilted quality that at moments almost seemed a reflection of Mr. Collins ' laughable turgidity . Darcy himself implicitly defended the pompousness of his early " style of writing , " characterized by the simple Bingley as one which finds him studying " too much for words of four syllables " ( p. 44 ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austen does change Darcy 's " accent " to a directness of expression that we suspect must have seemed a change even to Mrs. Reynolds , had she been listening to him before . It seems clear the two possible Darcys ? an unchanging one whose early shyness was mistaken for pride and a prideful one whom love causes to undergo a profound change to humility ? are both left standing , each supported by some passages and disputed by others . Austen must choose to play it safe either way , though she is fully committed to neither . One might , sympathetically , claim a synthesis by asserting that , while Darcy has indeed changed as he has acknowledged , he had not really too far to come because even at the first he was less blameworthy than he appeared . But of course if this would not totally ignore either of the two Darcys , using each to qualify the other , it would not explain either of them or those elements in each which would seem to contradict the other . The passages involved rather suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes to protect herself whichever way we choose . She needs Darcy to appear as he does at the start , but she also needs the Darcy described by Mrs. Reynolds so that the Pemberley magic can transform Elizabeth 's concept of him . And she can not quite trust either one or rework her materials to eliminate either one . It is , as I began by suggesting , the unyielding complexity of Darcy that causes Austen her difficulties with him . Instead of using the reversals with which she snapped her other characters into place , she is confronted with the need to stage a character shift ? even if she momentarily denies it is a shift . And a total turnabout by a character is very different from a reversal forced upon essentially static characters by the structure of the plot . Yet such a turnabout is by far the more likely interpretation of her intention , although she is clearly uncomfortable with the weak conviction her case carries , so that she is driven to lay out an alternative set of probabilities as well . Part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dynamic , changing Darcy stems from the sort of character he would have to have been and the doubts this sort of character would have  | cast on the communal security she values most . Thus this character shift tells us a good deal about Austen 's visionary propensities and limitations . I perhaps have oversimplified the issues by asking only whether Darcy was prideful before , or only diffident , or something of each . The questions really concern the early Darcy as a brooding , somewhat anti-social , internalized being , enough of an aristocrat to contemn the petty togetherness into which Bingley 's company thrusts him ? even if his loyalty to Bingley apparently persuades him to put up with it , he does so always grudgingly . It is this brooding internality that Austen must not put up with , lest it challenge dangerously the unquestioned security with which she presents her bourgeois world , for all its failings , which she so freely mocks . The cordial good humor we find in him at Pemberley is conditioned in part by his feelings for Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please her , in part by the superior behavior of the Gardiners , in part because ? as Mrs. Reynolds has tipped us off ? he is on his home ground . But mainly he changes in order to be worthy of Elizabeth , as she has changed to be worthy of him ; and that means he changes in order to satisfy Austen 's need to break through whatever is anti-social in him , to make him one ? an acceptable and only partly exceptional one ? of her many . So , through Elizabeth , Austen domesticates him and externalizes his being . Still , she has enough misgivings to leave the possibility that perhaps he has been misunderstood and has been a proper social being all along , so that we should never have had to worry about him . Assuming that Austen has rescued Darcy for Elizabeth and for her own view of the public social order as revealed by social good sense , we must wonder how much this society is worth , with its values that she so pervasively satirizes . Are these superficial idols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or attachments ( which is to say attachments as arrangements ) , in their turn worth the sacrifice of that interiority ? that consciousness of an isolated self ? before which they would crumble ? It is in the character of Elizabeth and the somewhat more moderate change she undergoes that we can best examine these questions . Elizabeth must also change to earn her right to Darcy , since her early failings need correction as much as his do . But her change is made more credible than his because we can trace it within her consciousness , inasmuch as Austen occasionally shifts her own  | perspective as objective observer to that of her favorite , Elizabeth . In other places too , despite what is mainly a neutral , dramatic point of view consisting of speeches and stage directions , from time to time we have an awareness of a narrating presence capable of a mockery close to Elizabeth 's , even as Elizabeth 's capacity for mockery is a reflection of her father 's . As her father 's daughter , Liz ' begins primarily as a humorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her judgment ; and she clearly has a substantial supply of both . But both of these produce failings which suggest not only her imperfection but ? in the light of this imperfection ? her need to soften and humanize her responses and to temper them with a mature sense of social responsibility . Her judgment deserts her not merely in the matter of Charlotte 's cold-blooded decision to marry Mr. Collins , but far more crucially , in her weighing the respective moral capacities for decency and villainy in Darcy and Wickham . Her instincts , because of her personal involvement , turn out to mislead her ; and ? thus misled ? she even misreads considerable evidence which , as she recapitulates it too late , she should have judged differently . Such costly errors in judgment lead her to recognize the limits of her acuteness and , more than this , the limited value of mere acuteness self-indulged . This recognition leads in turn to her critique of both mere wit and the profession of the humorist which she has learned from her father . The social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfaction of wit , are an irresponsibility that can produce social disaster . Of course , this notion requires as its assumption that social disaster is to be avoided rather than laughed at after it occurs , that society as an ongoing mechanism is sufficiently acceptable for one to want to prevent disaster . This is the assumption which Liz learns to make , as her father does not . It leads to her moral rejection of her father 's posture as well as of her own earlier posture . If she recognizes that her father has arrived at this posture as his only possible response to the misery of his unfortunate marriage , she sees also that one has the duty to try to prevent further miseries of this sort for others . It is Darcy 's letter to her at Rosings that reveals to her her own inadequacy and the inadequacy of her posture . Her confidence in both her wit and her judgment is undermined by his defense of himself . She explicitly tells herself that this is a moment of utter self-discovery : footnote 2 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing Elizabeth as her father 's whimsical daughter .  | She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. ? Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think , without feeling that she had been blind , partial , prejudiced , absurd . " How despicably have I acted ! " she cried. ? " I , who have prided myself on my discernment ! ? I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! ... How humiliating is this discovery ! ? Yet , how just a humiliation ! ... vanity , not love , has been my folly .... Till this moment , I never knew myself . " ( p. 201 ) Thus she condemns her judgment . But it is her free , unattached wittiness ? like that of her father ? and the dedication of them both to wit that are more severely condemned . The condemnation of this wittiness is more gradual , but its consequences are far-reaching . It begins with her painful acknowledgment to herself that Darcy 's complaints in the letter about the unseemly behavior of her family ( all but Jane 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uttering them , are justified . But her responses here are not simply immediate and made once only ; she reverts to this charge again and again , adjusting her own behavior to meet it . She shortly sees " the folly and indecorum of her own family " as depriving Jane of her deserved happiness , and she attributes " the unhappy defects of her family " in large measure to her father , who , " contented with laughing at them , would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters " ( p. 206 ) . He freely laughs too at the mother , who reveals no more sense or more decorous behavior than they do . Liz begins to see him ? and , indirectly herself ? as a fool of wit instead of the paragon of wittiness she thought them both earlier . If they were leagued together in their disdainful contempt before , they are guilty of its consequences now . And if her father can not change , Liz can , and dedicates herself to do so . Austen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright daughter 's attitude toward it , now undergoing a profound change , is a reflection of Elizabeth 's ? or , rather , suggests the extent to which Liz serves as Austen 's mouthpiece . The exposition which opens chapter 42 brings us up to date on what is happening to Elizabeth 's sense of her family 's social appearance and her father 's responsibility for it , in the light of Darcy 's letter . In this exposition Austen corroborates the moral judgment that has just followed from Elizabeth 's self-discovery.  | Austen sees Mr. Bennet 's enormous mistake in his choice of a wife as the source of his irresponsibility , his role as a fool of wit : " To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted , than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement . This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife ; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting , the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given . " Austen slips from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her painful awareness of " the impropriety of her father 's behavior as a husband " which she had preferred not to dwell upon , in part because of the sympathy of their temperaments . Darcy 's note , however , has brought a critical component to her awareness : " But she had never felt so strongly as now , the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage , nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents ; talents which rightly used , might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters , even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife " ( p. 228 ) . Elizabeth has already acted upon this new sense of responsibility . When she hears the inane " lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house " as the regiment prepares to leave Meryton , " Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them ; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame . She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy 's objections " ( p. 221 ) . Further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquiescence when Lydia desires to go with the regiment to Brighton in the company of the Forsters ( " Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances " ) . Liz is clearly impatient with this by now familiar pattern of her father 's mockery and willingly draws some of that mockery on herself and her new-found earnestness as she speaks ( though only in general terms ) of the unfortunate consequences of the sort of behavior Mr. Bennet 's laxity indirectly condones . She even half-prophesies the imminent danger into which Lydia 's freely permitted indulgence will place the family as well as Lydia herself : Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia 's character .  | Excuse me ? for I must speak plainly . If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . ( p. 223 ) But Mr. Bennet , though more serious for a moment , persists in his permissiveness with Lydia , closing with another sardonic remark : " At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . " Though " disappointed and sorry , " Elizabeth is content with her sense " of having performed her duty " and lets it go at that . She will come to rue not being more intransigent with her father when the Brighton escapade later proves so costly . It is clear that Elizabeth finds parts of the blame for these unhappy consequences in herself as the half-willing confederate of her father . After the news about Lydia and Wickham disperses the friendly gathering at Pemberley , Liz reacts by referring again to the family 's role in Lydia 's unfortunate act : " The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now feel it " ( p. 268 ) . Indeed , it is their mutual guilt , their shared responsibility for Lydia 's plight , that helps bring Liz and Darcy together . What each has failed to do to prevent the impending domestic catastrophe results from their resistance to full social self-commitment . The embarrassing episode involving Wickham and Georgiana Darcy ( which occurred long before the events of the novel ) had given Darcy information about the potential dangers in Wickham , information which might have been used to protect Lydia from the similar fate Wickham creates for her . In the end , Darcy sees himself as having failed to have sufficient interest in affairs or people outside his immediate circle to forestall Wickham 's further villainy . We are told that Darcy feels that it was owing to himself that Wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him . He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before  | thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world . His character was to speak for itself . He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . ( pp. 309 ? 10 ) If Darcy 's lack of social involvement has allowed Wickham the unblemished reputation that made him available to Lydia ( or , earlier , to Liz herself ! ) , Liz ? as we have observed ? failed to provide for Lydia those conditions that would have prevented her from being his willing victim . And Liz 's failure is related to her own earlier resistance to personal involvement , which springs in her case from the objectivity and detachment that wit requires , as Mr. Bennet 's example had taught her . We have noted that her failures of judgment occur when her personal concerns lead to a subjectivity that blurs her normal clarity of perception . It is this discovery of herself , of her imperfect humanity , that brings her down from the transcendent perch she used to share with her father ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making herself and those about her fitter for their social roles . She can from this time on indulge her solicitude and , in doing so , earns her right to Darcy , who in turn has earned his right to her by also taking up the responsibility of commitment . In this way the crisis over Lydia , in part attributed by each of them to his own failings , leads them to move from a mutual sense of guilt to a mutual responsibility for the helpful social role which , together in marriage , they can play . At the close , the suggested improvement of Kitty under their guidance ( " by proper attention and management " ) is to serve as impressive evidence of their functioning within this new role . But we must ask again about the value of that society and its niches , for the service of which Liz and Darcy feel so much responsibility that they undertake to shed the excess individuality , which can have antisocial consequences . Can the flimsy values which Austen so honestly ? and often satirically ? shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ignore the obvious fact that , from the standpoint of what happens to Elizabeth , this is a novel about " making it " ? much in the British novelistic tradition of Pamela and Joseph Andrews ? But Wickham is not permitted to make it : it is as if , in Tom Jones , Blifil turned out to be the good guy . For it is Darcy , the wealthiest and most  | highly placed character in the novel , who is its hero and who gets the girl . The girl also gets him and in a bound vaults to the top of this social world . Wickham does not , like Tom Jones , make the discovery which makes him the worthy hero ; rather , the discovery is made about him to make him the worthless villain . He stays poor , as befits his original low-born status , while Darcy retains his desirable status intact . And Austen , here a defender of her society , gives to each the character whose moral worth matches the worth attached to his social position . By not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( rich boy makes good ) , Austen forgoes her opportunity for a satire truly directed against the appearances that dominate her society 's petty structure . And by allowing Liz to " make it " with Darcy , Austen further supports that structure by allowing her most intelligent ( and , finally , her most morally aware ) character to achieve a hoped-for escalation within it , but only by underwriting it . It must be noted that Austen shrewdly refuses to force Liz to choose between a marriage of convenience and a marriage of inclination . This stacking of the cards is in accordance with Austen 's naively classic avoidance of the " either/or , " as if there were no possibility except the " both/and . " ( Here is a further thematic reflection of her persistent use of the peripety in order to ensure the wholeness of the social fabric . ) But what if it were Wickham rather than Darcy , the poor rather than the wealthy , whom Liz loved ? Though Austen can not permit this either/or , she is too honest not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if her dedication to her society precludes her seeing the problem as more than a hypothetical one . But she does allow it to become at least hypothetical by having Liz consider Wickham as a potential husband early in the novel . And in two dialogues between Liz and Mrs. Gardiner she freely exhibits the dilemma that even the most intelligent can feel when confronted by this society 's values . By inserting these dialogues and permitting the hypothetical problem , she candidly opens herself and the values her best characters espouse to the most damaging casuistic assault , and by providing this assault herself , she disarms us . In chapter 26 Mrs. Gardiner openly advises Liz not to become involved " in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent " ? whatever Wickham 's charms and however strong her feelings for him . In response , Liz acknowledges the imprudence of any serious relationship between them , so that it would be better for  | Wickham not to become " attached " to her . Still , she can not promise to be prudent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurry , " even not to wish to have won him : " In short , I will do my best . " But she can not guarantee that her best will be good enough , that her affections might not force her to throw prudence to the winds . Her aunt seems satisfied , and Elizabeth is not resentful of this apparently coldblooded intrusion . Her own response has been anything but irrationally hotblooded ; she clearly has the good sense her aunt has attributed to her . Indeed , there is a large measure of agreement between them . Austen has been most shrewd to have given this role and these words to Mrs. Gardiner , whose intelligence and taste we are to respect and who is by no means a representative of the more objectionable features or values of this society . In the next chapter , however , there is a second round to this discussion , one in which Elizabeth somewhat bitterly and sharply takes the offensive , getting a measure of revenge with a mock-worldliness of her own which is more extreme than her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Miss King , who has recently become wealthy . In accordance with her conversation with her aunt , Elizabeth finds this a prudent and acceptable act on his part . Austen has warned us , however ? in words that anticipate what Mrs. Gardiner 's position will be ? that in approving his act , Liz is being " less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte 's " ( since she had rejected Charlotte 's marriage to Collins as a shabby compromise with convenience ) . When Mrs. Gardiner accuses Wickham of being mercenary , Elizabeth , recalling their prior conversation , asks , " Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary " ( p. 149 ) . If her aunt thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Rather , she proceeds to distinguish carefully among shades of indelicacy that move certain acts over the boundary separating the prudent from the mercenary , discretion from avarice . Clearly , this excellent woman is resorting to discriminations based , not on principle , but on a worldly though not amoral compromise with principle , on ad hoc considerations that ? morally speaking ? may seem shabby , pragmatic , mere trimming . But she presents them with a firmness that makes them  | Austen 's last and authoritative word . Neither Elizabeth nor we need to worry about testing them by means of our story , of course , since Wickham is removed from consideration by his author , who has arranged for him to have a villainous character and for Elizabeth soon to discover it . It is in conformity with her comic sense and her Mrs.-Gardiner-like worldliness that Austen prudently arranges for Elizabeth to join inclination and convenience in her marriage to Darcy . Any extremity that might arise from Liz having to make a choice between the two is neatly avoided . Again , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those forces that work for social affirmation . We have seen that the question of convenience is closely tied to the Charlotte-Collins marriage . What Elizabeth sees as Charlotte 's sell-out of herself is to be distinguished from the prudence and caution Mrs. Gardiner urges upon Elizabeth in her relations with Wickham ; but it is to be seen as similar to Wickham 's sudden interest in the newly rich Miss King . So the marriage of convenience ( without inclination ) is to be avoided , as is the marriage of inclination ( without convenience ) . How to choose , then ? The answer , of course , is to be guided by an author like Jane Austen so as not to permit the dilemma to arise , to avoid the either/or by having convenience accompany inclination , as it does for Elizabeth with Darcy . Out of these attitudes toward marriage emerges one 's possible attitude toward the social structure : acceptance and submission , or rejection and rebellion , or a withdrawn satiric transcendence . Certainly total , uncritical submission is represented by Charlotte 's marriage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not for a moment contemplate seriously and which she sadly , disappointedly condemns ( seeing Charlotte as having " sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage " pp. 123-24 ) . At the other end of the spectrum of attitudes , Wickham would seem to represent the extreme of rebellion , a reckless willingness to violate the most sacred taboos of the society ( among other things , seeking twice to undo young virgins ) . But , as we have seen , he is a pseudo-romantic fraud : behind his dashing appearance of willful daring , he is a crass schemer who works to beat this money-ridden society at its own game , demonstrating as he goes his deep obeisance to its values . If Austen has arranged for Darcy to give up the internality that isolates him , she does not permit Wickham any inner life at all . He is no rebel , no dedicated outlaw , only a  | cheaply ambitious ne'er-do-well . He therefore presents no alternative but is just another less honest exemplar of the total subordination to this society 's shabby values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with would-be rebels in Austen 's tight , circumscribed world . He may appear to be at the other end of the spectrum from Charlotte , but in Austen 's world such apparent opposition is a deceptive mask for similarity . It is no accident that , as Austen herself intrusively reminds us , Wickham 's pursuit of Miss King is reminiscent of Charlotte 's acceptance of Collins , so that it is only Elizabeth 's blindness which keeps her from making the comparison . No , a true rebellion against these values can not take place within the context created by our shrewd , deck-stacking novelist . But in Mr. Bennet we find that intelligence can provide an alternative response , an unwillingness to affirm and support society , to submit to values based on stupidities such as intelligence must scorn . But his alternative is no more than a hands-off satiric withdrawal from action , whether for or against the society , whether inside or outside society . Though hardly rebellion , it is a critical rejection of society , sponsored by the habit of derision , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejecting the very possibilities of social life because of the folly it inevitably entails . But the costliness of this attitude leads to a clear condemnation of it , even on the part of Elizabeth , who has in part shared its spirit . This notion of costliness assumes that there are consequences to be avoided ; it assumes there is something to be lost which is worth trying to save ; it assumes the need to preserve social values as a framework within which social relationships are to be made to serve the pleasures and satisfactions of man as a social animal . This is a great deal to assume , as her father seems to be reminding Liz when he sees her allegiance slipping away from him and her disapproval focusing on him . But Liz , like her aunt , puts aside the clean distinctions among positions in order to make life in society ( and where else can it take place ? ) less rather than more painful and more rather than less honest ; she must work for the ad hoc compromises that deny the purity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by improving the attitude of those who partake of them . Even marriages as unfortunate as that of the elder Bennets can not be used to justify withdrawal or rejection . And those marriages which take place during the course of the novel between Charlotte and Collins or Lydia and Wickham are found at the end to be still part of the world within  | which Liz and Darcy operate helpfully . Of course , they also ( together with Jane and Bingley ) work with Kitty to try to prevent more such marriages from taking place . One does what one can with what one has . The key to all this , of course , is the critical intelligence , intelligence used not to indulge the cruelly dissociated purposes of wit but to encourage the less unsatisfactory performance of the human function by persons forced to operate within a most deficient social structure ? deficient , but the only one available at the moment and probably not much worse than most others , given the predominantly silly nature of man . But this acceptance is not to be confounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely the point of the two dialogues between Elizabeth and her aunt . For Elizabeth 's is the highly critical acceptance of the mature intelligence . She does not totally forgo her wit , though human sympathy has softened it into a graceful humor . Intelligence like hers sees through to the silliest of society 's follies , the most offensive of its absurdities , while continuing to accept it and its need to extend its domination into the future . This acceptance is dictated by the demands of social , human sympathy which , as subjective , exacts this price of intelligence : to see the truth about the social structure while still leaving that structure standing , even fortified . In this way , involvement forces intelligence to reject withdrawal for critical commitment , which is a sort of submission also , though a submission that has its hold-out sense of incompleteness . Still , intelligence is given its value by the human act of involvement and the mature responsibility that is its consequence ; intelligence is thus converted into a social virtue , in Austen as later in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bingley is yet another thing , different from the knowing , willfully uncritical submission of Charlotte and the knowing , willfully critical half-submission of Elizabeth . Jane 's compliance grows out of her utter innocence , a lack of self-consciousness that has kept her from the first an inoffensive , because unwillful , almost automatic , part of the ongoing social structure . There may be in Jane or Bingley little intelligence ( either to separate themselves from that structure or , having separated , to reunite themselves with it ) , but neither is there the unkindness that could turn them into those who pursue society 's values selfishly , knowingly manipulating its worse public tendencies for private ends . The failure of someone as bright as Charlotte is not a failure of discernment but a failure to make an adequate moral assessment of the possibilities re-  | maining for her to fulfill her social function . As a comic novelist , of course , Austen must take creatures like Jane and Bingley under her protection by weaving the pattern of their fortunes into her social fabric , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain her central and problematic concern . In them the problems of choice , of decision about one 's personal and social destiny , present themselves to the rational and moral intelligence , which is to recognize that , in public structure and in private character , society will smile upon those who commit themselves ? however critically ? to it with the combined virtues of responsibility and involvement . Here too , then , the deck has been stacked in favor of the moderate victory of this hardly impressive set of social values , which Austen at once sees through and cherishes . Everything has been put into the service of this always managed , inevitable victory : plot with its comic pattern of reversals , the positioning of heroes and villains on appropriate levels in the social hierarchy , and even intelligence itself , which at first , in Mr. Bennet , was seen as the potential enemy ? or at least as the agent provocateur ? poised to thwart the realization of society 's aims . Whatever the seeming obstacles , all comes out right-side-up for those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There may be no challenge to the formality of this world , with every potential obstacle discovered to be an aid , every potential villain discovered to be either a hero or a more or less innocuous fool . It may not be a very natural community , but in its own way it is a human one . As if created by a classic existent rather than a classic visionary , Austen 's is a precious world , preserved by the a priori exclusion of what she dares not allow to disturb it . It precludes , rather than rejects , extremity . Here is a tight little island of a book , formally and thematically , formally because thematically . The trim security of the little world 's closed values ' is joined to Austen 's trimness of structure , in footnote a Austen shows us she is conscious of the narrow round of her concern . She explicitly limits herself to the bourgeois closet within which she has enclosed her interest . Thus , when her characters travel beyond their immediate ambience toward Pemberley , she is careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outward : " It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire , nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay ; Oxford , Blenheim , Warwick , Kenelworth , Birmingham , &c.; are sufficiently known . A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern " ( p. 232 ) .  | which all elements are manipulated so as to support this small , modest unity in a society ( and a novel ) whose form is its meaning as well as its value . BARCHESTER TOWERS From Pride and Prejudice we have learned the limitations upon the classic vision that are imposed by too hasty and uncritical an acceptance of the human community as a conventional human community . We see life only as life in society , without the challenge of private human presumption or even very much assumption that there is a private human realm . In my own terminology , I might say that the naively classic must prefer to see the veil as the canopy and thus to sense no distinction between a shabbily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that extremity which threatens to confront us once we have challenged the simplistic universality of the ethical . If he need not either confront or retreat from the threat of the vision yielded by a private awareness , the classic existent ( insufficiently challenged by that which would convert him to visionary ) must accept communal life as a good , as his major value , always to be asserted , always to be reimposed , whatever the weaknesses that sustain it in its social dimension . Thus it is that we have seen Austen 's dominant metaphor to be one in which the overriding demands of society always are satisfied , in which everything and everyone ? however they are thrown up into the air ? find themselves resettled into the dominant patterns society requires of them . Their chance to stray permanently is precluded , even as extremity is . Yet the utterly closed structure , as it is imposed upon this tight little closet of a world and a plot , need not be the only way to assure the dominance of the accepted ? if admittedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in Barchester Towers ; it is enough of a variation within what I think of as the naively classic for me to pause briefly on it . Trollope 's , by comparison with Austen 's , is an open form , even though he too manages to stack the deck almost totally in favor of the victory of a relaxed communal consciousness . There is , let it be granted , more of what seems like a challenge to the reigning values of the novel 's world than Austen permits , but here too the author has worked to undercut the seriousness of any threat that looms .  | The opposition raised by puritanical austerity to the modest relaxedness of the Church of England , Barchester-style , creates a conflict that is hardly new to the dominant English novelistic tradition . Indeed , we can recall it from the dawn of the English novel in Thomas Nashe 's The Unfortunate Traveller , where Jack Wilton reserves his severest contempt and his best tricks for the moralistic puritan gravity that would undermine his essentially classic levity . Trollope himself confesses his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of his overly Protestant villain , Obadiah Slope , to two embattled if ineffectual characters in Tristram Shandy , even suggesting that infamous malpractitioner Dr. Slop as an actual ( though of course fictional ) ancestor . This conflict between the ascetically moralistic ( represented here , as so often in English fiction , by an " enthusiastic " Protestantism ) and the relaxed classic ( represented by the Church of England spirit of Barchester ) is surely a more serious clash ? threatening the fortunes of all our favorites among the characters ? than Austen allows ; but Trollope remains as surely in control of the inevitable happy resolution as Austen was . His devices for ensuring the victory of Barchesterian values are , as I have noted , not those which grow out of a tightly manipulated structure of action , like Austen s . Trollope has an apparent openness of plot that would seem to be receptive to all possible threats . Yet this relaxed form echoes , as it secures , the dominant vision , equally relaxed , so that our anxieties are constantly allayed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his always reassuring tone , can accomplish what Austen leaves to her plot to do . Trollope is more willing than Austen to remind us of what his novel is not . While Austen will never permit a glance at any other sort of world or novel than what her tight social order and form enclose , Trollope can cozy us into a humorous awareness of the heroic and romantic world which he and the world of his novel deliberately eschew . Thus he continually ? though gently ? prods us with his mock-heroic or even downright anti-heroic reminders , which reduce our sense of any threat either to the characters or to the values which their good fortune would reinforce and secure . Whether he is comparing Mrs. Quiverful to the lioness ( chapter 25 ) , Eleanor or Mr. Slope to figures within the scope of the " tragic muse " ( chapters 29 , 40 , 51 ) , or Mrs. Proudie to Medea ( chapter 33 ) , the mild and good-humored Trollope is reminding us of the relatively insignificant consequences of actions undertaken in " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author tries to deliver his proper Barchesterians from Slopean evils with a " melodramatic denouement , " he finds that Dr. Gwynne , his would-be deus ex machina , can not come to Barchester as the " avenging god " because he is " laid up with the gout " ( chapter 34 ) . There is a similar light-hearted mockery in the story itself , insofar as it is a constructed fable . With his easy openness of form , Trollope is anxious to speak for his story ( and before his story ) rather than allowing it to speak for him , as the manipulating Jane Austen did . The complications of his plot are false complications in that he wants us not to worry about them as he assures us that all will come out well . Announcing the arrival of Mr. Arabin on the scene with the promising chapter title " The New Champion " ( chapter 14 ) , Trollope follows with the chapter " The Widow 's Suitors , " in which he guarantees to keep the reader in his confidence and urges that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will not permit Eleanor to marry either Slope or Bertie Stanhope . Thus , whatever misunderstandings follow are not to concern us , for we have the author 's word for it that they are to be of no consequence . Yet a good number of what might have been serious misunderstandings do follow , so that the complications of plot would seem to be intricate ones ? they would seem to be , except that we have been guaranteed by our honest , cheerful author that they will , finally , be insignificant , that they are really make-believe complications . In this sense , unlike Austen s , this plot is explicitly paraded as a fake plot , not meant to work itself out but to be subjected to the author 's willful offstage intrusions . Trollope 's care to belittle any possibilities that would undermine the dominance of his Barchesterians and their values forces him to curtail the very appearance of a drama even momentarily unresolved . Such a drama would reveal itself by means of a brilliance of structure that would produce a thematic intensity out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require . So , as the misunderstandings , cross-purposes , near-misses , and looming catastrophes occur , they do not alarm us , especially as they are accompanied by our author 's constant and constantly soothing voice . Nothing can come of anything ? except what we want to come and what we have been promised all along will come . In the meantime , the game that " befits the low-heeled buskin of modern fiction " is permitted to be played for our amusement . In the masquerades of feelings and mis-  | taken identities of the long " middle " of the plot , we have partly a use and partly a mock-use of the Elizabethan formula for comedy . Finally , the conspiratorial comic villain ? he who would gull others ? is himself gulled and hooted off the stage . And , as we have noted , the pretext for his masquerade ? his apparent motive ? is an excessive sobriety , a fraudulent moralism which the good folk , in their less self-consciously moral way , unmask as fraudulent . As so often occurs in Renaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nglish tradition rightly distrusts the self-righteousness which refuses to distrust itself . A central feature of Trollope 's mock-seriousness , whether of plot or of vision , is his invention of Slope as his villain . Nothing undercuts any possible melodramatic challenge more than the fact that Slope , for all his shrewdness , turns out to be half inept ? and that the crucial half . Indeed , as a villain he is incomplete in every direction . He is clearly inadequate even in his apparent austerity of vision : because he uses his puritan guise only to serve his self-interest , he can not represent a true challenge to Barchesterian values . He is equally inadequate as a threat to the fortunes of his antagonists because even his selfinterest is undercut , undercut surprisingly , by his daring , almost admirable recklessness . This curious audacity tempts him to the pursuit of Signora Neroni , which must lead to the defeat of his hopes ; ' and it tempts him to the open defiance of Mrs. Proudie , which must destroy him utterly in Barchester . Hardly capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a creature of enormous resilience : he bobs up again , a successful , " eloquent " preacher and " pious " clergyman somewhere else ( " it is well known that the family of the Slopes never starve : they always fall on their feet like cats " ) . This enrichment of Slope beyond what Trollope would appear to need or want to have in a spiritually impoverished villain actually serves his purposes well both structurally and thematically . Besides providing us additional assurances about how the story is to come out , Trollope 's Slope also guarantees that we will not have to consider the possibility that Barchesterian values may be in need of correction , that Barchester 's vision may be incomplete . For if Slope and Mrs. Proudie represent the major alternative to those values , then Barchester is not really being challenged at all . This is not another version of the con- footnote A strange Machiavel this is , who , in his infatuation , " could not bring himself to be commonly prudent , " as Trollope admits in chapter 32.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel the moral position of Mr. Irwine betrayed its inadequacy when confronted by a dilemma to which a more austere ethic seemed appropriate : Irwine 's very laxness opened him to the attack of Adam , opened Loamshire to the threat of Stonyshire . To this extent the classic vision , as it was achieved in Adam Bede , had to be profoundly earned . The world of Slope and Mrs. Proudie presents no such challenge to Messrs . Harding and Arabin . For Trollope , Slope represents a moralism which is inherently impossible because it makes too great demands upon man and encourages a self-righteousness which our actions ? in our common weakness ? can never justify . What easier device is there for the novelist who is anxious to preclude any serious challenge to Barchesterian values than to make his would-be puritans hypocrites ? But the claim to righteousness must , for Trollope , be self-deceptive , thus opening the way to hypocrisy . And the most demandingly moral character turns out to be the most patently immoral , the most ruthlessly selfinterested . Ethical severity , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the cover for the basest worldly ambition , for money-grubbing and even lechery . By contrast , the more traditional Church of England spirit , which demands so little of man and understands so much about his incapacities , produces the good souls whose behavior belies their insistent acknowledgment of their imperfections . The beneficent power of the church , of the spirit of Barchester , is shown at the very start of the novel as it operates upon the archdeacon , the younger Dr. Grantly . Here is a " proud , wishful , worldly man , " indeed , a potential Slope . In the opening scene , one of the most delicate and sensitive in the novel , Grantly confronts the sinful consequence of his ambition : at his father 's bedside during his final hours , Grantly finds himself , involuntarily , wishing that the old bishop 's death can occur soon enough for the son to inherit his title . The father is dying " as he had lived , peaceably , slowly , without pain and without excitement . The breath ebbed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , it was a question whether he were alive or dead . " Here is a death like that of Dr. Johnson 's Levet , or like the undramatic , routine death we have seen as the least vain of vain wishes ( " An age that melts with unperceive 'd decay , / And glides in modest Innocence away " ) . Truly a Barchesterian death . But there is an urgency and timeliness to the younger Grantly 's desire , since an  | impending change in the government could doom his chances for succeeding his father as bishop . Though the " proud , wishful , worldly man " is powerless to keep himself from wishing the death to occur in time , both Trollope and he are able to face and to accept his wishing it . We witness his embarrassment as he " at last dared to ask himself whether he really longed for his father 's death , " and we witness his confession as he falls to his knees " and taking the bishop 's hand within his own , prayed eagerly that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies , and the son , not knowing it is already too late , engages in the comedy of haste with Mr. Harding , who in his innocence utters to Grantly the piety expressed for a peaceful death after a long illness , a piety that we must take ironically ( and almost outrageously ) once we hear it as Grantly must hear it : " You can not but rejoice that it is over . " Indeed the son can rejoice : " He had brought himself to pray for his father 's life , but now that life was done , minutes were too precious to be lost . " The crass worldliness of his futile connivings ? even to his calculated misuse of the unknowing Harding ? is more painful for Trollope to contemplate than it is for Grantly . But Trollope deals openly with the archdeacon 's behavior , denies that such worldliness is " wicked " since it is inevitably human , and confesses that the nolo episcopari is " at variance with the tendency of all human wishes . " " If we look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably teach ourselves to think that they are less . " Thus for Trollope ( as it has been for Grantly ) man can accept ? by first acknowledging ? what he is capable of . First there is the willingness not to rationalize one 's actions but rather to confess the worst of one 's human tendencies ; then there is the prayerful hope that one may not be as wicked as one seems ; finally there is the acceptance of what one is , as human , and this is the enabling act permitting one to carry on ? about as before , if slightly chastened . So even the Grantlys of Barchester are tolerable so long as they remain within the churchly shelter of Barchester . The habit of expecting and looking for the worst of secret motives in oneself characterizes even the utterly innocent Mr. Harding and the half-innocent half-warrior Mr. Arabin . They are full of self-distrust , always suspicious of a worldly , selfish motive for the best of their actions . They are , as Trollope admits , imperfect characters because of a weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a willingness " to look for impure motives " for their con-  | duct . This is Barchesterian weakness , the reverse side of Barchesterian virtue , for they find such unworthy motives even where they clearly do not exist , so that they often cut themselves off from the firmness needed to be proper fighters for their " church militant . " Surely this weakness is a less dangerous failing than others we see in the novel . Indeed , our author has arranged for such good people as these to be saved by the errors of their less self-distrustful enemies whose selfdeceptions lead to fatal blunders . In this novel too much self-distrust is better ? and more successful ? than not enough . The religion of the Hardings and Arabins can thus be preserved in its humanness by the failures of any harsher religion to keep its defender from blunders of too much self-indulgence . The extreme Protestantism professed by Slope must leave him exposed to such failures . And here the author must beg it to be remembered that Mr. Slope was not in all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most men , were mixed ; and though his conduct was generally very different from that which we would wish to praise , it was actuated perhaps as often as that of the majority of the world by a desire to do his duty . He believed in the religion which he taught , harsh , unpalatable , uncharitable as that religion was . He believed those whom he wished to get under his hoof , the Grantlys and Gwynnes of the church , to be the enemies of that religion . He believed himself to be a pillar of strength , destined to do great things ; and with that subtle , selfish , ambiguous sophistry to which the minds of all men are so subject , he had taught himself to think that in doing much for the promotion of his own interests he was doing much also for the promotion of religion . An incomplete religion produces an incomplete man , who makes use of it to mask his incompleteness . Slope turns out to be a not much more efficient villain than Wickham : in short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say a semi-villain who is not allowed to pose a major threat to the comedy . True , in his proclaimed moralism he does seem to represent an alternative vision and way of life , as Wickham does not . So if the victory were to be Slope 's , it would carry certain
