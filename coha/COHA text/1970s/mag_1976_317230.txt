Black Americans , one of the last solid voting blocs hi the nation , gave almost 90% of their ballots to George McGovern in 1972 . That translated into an estimated 6 million votes , or 20% of his total at the polls . For all their potential muscle , however , blacks have felt themselves out in the political cold for years - ignored since 1968 by Republican Washington and slighted in Democratic councils since McGovern 's defeat . <P> With 14 million blacks eligible to vote ( about half of them are registered ) , black leaders this year are determined to barter their influence with this sizable bloc for increased influence on Democratic Party policy . That task has been made considerably more difficult by the fact that , at an unexpectedly early date , Georgia 's Jimmy Carter is virtually the only Democratic candidate left with whom to strike a bargain . Many blacks who had counted on Hubert Humphrey to serve as a rallying point were left stunned by his refusal to join the race . California Congressman Ron Dellums said : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got to the point where we ran out of alternatives . " <P> Still , blacks are organizing to make Carter-or whoever eventually gets the Democratic nomination-take notice of them . In a three-day meeting that ended last week in Charlotte , N.C. , more than 1,000 members of the Caucus of Black Democrats brandished what is at least their negative power-withholding black votes from a candidate they consider insufficiently responsive . Said Gary , Ind. , Mayor Richard Hatcher : " Any candidate running for President who feels that black people have no other option , no place to go , is in for a rude awakening . If we choose not to support any of the candidates , we could just stay home . " Putting it more affirmatively , Caucus Chairman Basil Paterson , who is also a vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee , remarked : " We can frame the issues hi such a way that blacks will be turned on . " <P> The conference drew up a " survival agenda " of demands . Among them : passage and quick federal action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national health-care program , strong enforcement of affirmative-action programs for black employment , a guaranteed national income plan , more money for impoverished areas . <P> Cabinet Posts . The pre-eminence of Jimmy Carter left the conference in some confusion and uneasiness . Much of the Georgian 's black support in the early primaries was rooted in the desire to eliminate George Wallace from the race . But , said Jesse Jackson , head of Chicago 's Operation PUSH ( for People United to Save Humanity ) : " The absence of Wallace is not the presence of justice . " According to Jackson , there is no candidate running who inspires the black community .
