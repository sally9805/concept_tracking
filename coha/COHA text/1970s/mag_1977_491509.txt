And what kind of tournament was it ? Well , there were burro races , egg-and-spoon races , tent-pegging , sack races , tugs-of-war and a lot of activ-ities that would n't even make the agenda of a company picnic today . Then after a dozen years of athletic trivia , Pasadena made a New Year 's date with destiny by open-ing 1902 with a football game so successful that there were eight fans for every seat in the stadium . On that miserably hot and dusty California afternoon , twenty-two rough-and-tumble combatants bullied each other from Pasa-dena right into the pages of history , giving birth to the great-great-granddaddy of all football bowl games ... the Rose Bowl . Three quarters of a century later the annual classic is as much an American institution as hot dogs , fireworks or the Sears catalog . It is run by an army of Tournament of Roses volunteers , NBC functionaries and conference officials to a pre cision that Cape Kennedy would envy . It 's one of the few things that would get that much of hung-over America out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so recently suffered . Perhaps the greatest testimony to its success is the long list of post-season imitators : The Orange Bowl , the Sugar Bowl , the Cotton Bowl , the Gator Bowl , the You-Name-ItA **28;3925;TOOLONG . Among those who tried and did n't make the cut were the Rhumba Bowl , Delta Bowl , Salad Bowl , Raisin Bowl , Gotham Bowl and Oil Bowl . Wherever there are enough able-bodied Americans to choose up sides on New Year 's Day , there 'll be a some-kind-of Bowl . G.I. 's in World War II staged the Tea Bowl in London , the Spaghetti Bowl in Florence and the Lilly Bowl in the Bahamas . The bowl craze has literally reached the end of the earth , where each January first , civilian scientists oppose Navy support personnel in the annual South Pole classic , the Ice Bowl . The Ice Bowl is played with 9,184 feet of ice covering the playing field , and with a doctor standing by to call off the game if the 50-degree-below-zero playing climate becomes too much for competitors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its heavily bearded players and certainly no restrictions against drinking while playing . The football bowl phenomenon is a monument to Americans ' longing for a play-off of champions . It is collegiate football 's Heavyweight Title Bout/World Series/U.S . Open/Stanley Cup/ Wimbledon . It was inevitable that this pitting of giant against giant would lead the pro football world to its own version , the Super Bowl , 11 .. . h iricic. ; en tally will be played in the Rose Bowl in January few days after the Big Ten and Pacific Eight have settled their accounts . The Rose Bowl was the Bowl for the first third of the twentieth century . Then after several decades of exclusivity , the Rose was joined by the Sugar , Orange , Cotton and Sun Bowls which popped up in the mid-Thirties to cash in on the play-off mania of the American football nut . They were masterminded by warm-climate chamber-of-commerce types who saw the immense benefit of national attention being focused on their good weather while much of the country was cursing its cold . And that , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tournament of Roses founders in 1889 ! But all of the competition has strengthened  --  not weakened ? the original Rose Bowl . It is still the largest ( in terms of spec-tators ) , most popular ( in terms of nationwide audience ) , and most famous of all the bowls . Roy Riegels might have run the wrong way in anybody else 's bowl , but his name would have been forgotten with the final gun if he had . The Four Horse-men could have finished their career anywhere , but it just happened to be in Pasadena . Ernie Nevers did n't play a one-man game with two broken ankles just anywhere . . . he chose the Rose Bowl ... against the above-named Horse-men . The T-Formation would probably have gained popu-larity anywhere but the Rose Bowl made it an overnight na-tional fetish . Ask O.J. Simpson , Jim Plunkett , Bob Griese or any number of today 's greats if they 'd trade their Rose Bowl fame for time in any other bowl . Ask them . . . then duck ! The Tournament of Roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equally well-known football game , staged in the morning and afternoon of the first day of the year . The tradition dates back to 1890 when zoologist Charles Holder suggested to fellow members of the Valley Hunt Club of Pasadena that a festival of flowers would be a perfect attraction to lure Easterners to Pasadena to fill the city 's hotel rooms . Pasa dena was the Palm Springs of the late 1800 's , profiting from midwinter visitors who came there to escape eastern winters . " Let 's have a festival and tell the world about our paradise , " said Holder , clutching newspaper clippings of the 1888 New York blizzard . The original , 1890 , Tournament of Roses parade featured flower-decorated carriages driven by members of the Valley Hunt Club . After the parade , there was athletic competition , if you want to call it that . There were foot races ( 111/4 seconds won the 100-yard dash ! ) , pony races , burro races and a " tourney of rings " in which horsemen carrying twelve-foot lances tried to spear three rings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flower-covered " tourney of rings " came the name for the celebration : Tournament of Roses . A wagonload of ripe oranges was distributed and youngsters Continued on page 82 // scattered rose petals along the dusty main drag of Pasadena . Three thousand showed up , with a thousand bringing along picnic lunches for the event , The Tournament was a huge success , and it even made money : $229.30 . Over the next twelve years , the Tournament grew out of the hands of the Valley Hunt Club into an event with its own organization . It survived its early controversies ( whether women should be allowed to straddle horses in the 1893 parade rather than riding sidesaddle and whether automobiles should be allowed in the 1901 event ) and hung onto its " Tournament of Roses " name in the face of pressure to change the name to Orange Tournament when roses were scarce in 1892 . January 1 , 1977 , will be the first day of America 's third century year . On that Saturday afternoon , the best of the West and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense minutes of collegiate football play that will be watched by over 104,000 , televised to another seventy million , and shared with sports history forever after . The original Rose Bowl contenders were Stanford and Michigan . Stanford could n't convince enough of its players to come to Pasadena for the holidays , so it filled out its team with five high school players from the Los Angeles area that day . Those five schoolboys plus the ten suited-up Indians were n't enough to make up for injuries , so Stanford did n't have enough able-bodied men to finish the game . No matter . Darkness was already setting in so the game was called with a few minutes left and the score already 49 to 0 in Michigan 's favor . W.K. Roosevelt ( second cousin of TR ) was one of the Stanford players hurt during the game . He finished it out though , playing with a broken leg and several fractured ribs . The Rose Bowl difference was already beginning to show ! Michigan played with the confidence that had earned them fame throughout the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yost did n't even make a substitution . On New Year 's Day , both teams rode in the Tournament of Roses parade ballyhooing their macho slogans to a curious crowd . So the crowd headed for Tournament Park a mile away . They walked . They rode bikes . There was an occasional horseless carriage . They waited , eight thousand hot and restless folk in front of locked gates at Tournament Park where the seating capacity was only one thousand . Then a small boy scurried to the top of the fence and over . Another followed his successful example . Then another . Soon an ocean of humanity was flowing over that fence and into the stadium . The first gate-crashers got the best seats , while those with legitimate tickets had to stand . The memory of those hordes of people elbowing their way into a stadium that could only seat one out of eight of them haunted the Tournament of Roses committee so much that it was fourteen years before football was invited back into the Tournament of Roses . The Tournament of Roses is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer labor . The 1,450 volunteers are set apart by their white suits on New Year 's Day and by their rolled-up shirt-sleeves during the other 364 days . Each year 's Tournament is run by an autocrat who worked his way up through yeoman service on various committees , committee chairmanships and finally through nine years on the executive committee . This year 's president is Carl E. Wopschall , whose father was mayor of Pasadena during the War . The most exclusive committee of the twenty-nine in the Tournament is the Football Committee , five men who deliver the Rose Bowl game to NBC , which in turn delivers it to the world . Only five men ! William H. Nicholas , a former Tournament president ( 1953 ) , is chairman and has served on the committee since 1947 ; but he 's a newcomer compared to Lathrop K. Leishman , one of his committee members . Leishman has been on the committee since 1938 and ran it as its chairman for three decades before passing the reins to Nicholas three years ago . Leishman ran the Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large sense it was and is . His father had the stadium built , back in 1923 , when the elder Leishman headed the football interests of the Tournament of Roses . It was Tournament money that built the Rose Bowl , made additions and improvements to it over the decades , and turned it over to the City of Pasadena with the understanding that the Tournament has first call on the facilities during thirty-one days of the month of December , plus January first . The Tournament of Roses runs the Rose Bowl through its chosen five : Nicholas , Leishman , Fred W. Soldwedel , Robert I , Cheney and Arthur D. Welsh . Listen to Leishman 's philosophy on the Rose Bowl . He speaks with a cautious traditionalism that is the watchword of the Tournament : " We 're really stuffy about being noninnovative . Our friends like it that way . We do n't want to be the laughingstock of the country . " Thi , kind of " innovation " Leishman and the committee intend to avoid at all costs covers all variations from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political statements during halftime shows  --  just good ol ' American music . And there are n't going to be any fools flying over the Bowl for publicity purposes . Or movie crews coming in to take advantage of the crowd . Or doctors having themselves paged . Or any stunts of any sort that would attract television coverage . " This is one game in the year we want to keep clean ! " Leishman vows , almost daring any troublemaker to stand in the way of the white suit army 's organized program . The Tournament had met its mate-to-be in 1902 , but the intensity of that first affair scared the Pasadenans away from any relationship that was so meant to be . In the thirteen years while absence made the heart grow fonder , Tournament officials turned from one fickle flame to another . They tried chariot racing because of the current Ben Hur rage . For a while , it seemed true love . The crowds increased to 20,000 , and the event made news back east . But if you 've seen one chariot race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the papers to report year after year ? Also , getting chariots and their chargers ready was costly business , leaving the participants $5,000 poorer with a chance at only $1,000 prize money . The Tournament even staged an ostrich race , complete with mounted riders , and a race between a camel and an elephant . ( On the off chance you 're interested , the elephant won . ) It staged a contest that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would have loved : a horse race between a cowboy , a Mexican , an Indian and a cowgirl . The EEOC would have approved of the winner , too . It was the cowgirl ! By 1915 the passion was too much for the Tournament to ignore . " We 'd better go back to football , " admitted Dr. F.F . Rowland , one of the co-founders of the Tournament of Roses in 1890 , Tournament president Lewis H. Turner agreed and set out to produce a game on January 1 , 1916 , significant enough to " give the newspapermen from coast to coast something exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football for ostriches , elephants , camels or chariots . With that decision to make football a major part of the Tournament of Roses , Pasadena would never be the same . And never would collegiate football . The year 1916 proved to be no great homecoming for the game that had been absent for fourteen years : 1902 had been hot and dusty ; 1916 was cold and waterlogged . Only 7,000 die-hards showed up to watch the Washington State Cougars take on Ivy League Brown with its All-American halfback , Fritz Pollard , one of the first exceptional black football stars . Washington State did n't practice for the New Year 's game . Instead they played football for a Hollywood film , Tom Brown of Harvard . They were paid $100 a day for their movie performances , and rumor was that they pooled their earnings to bet on themselves in the Tournament of Roses game . Evidently they went home wet but very rich since they won the game 14 to 0 . In 1917 , the weather warmed up to eighty-six , the crowd swelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oregon might not have been the best team in the West but they were $250 closer by railroad than Washington which had the same record , so Oregon got the nod to face Pennsylvania , with its quarterback Bert Bell ( later NFL president ) and tackle Lou Little ( who later coached a Columbia team in the Rose Bowl ) . Oregon won 14 to 0 . The 1922 game saw mighty Cal and its superhuman ( though ailing ) Brick Muller take on tiny Washington and Jefferson , a school with only 450 enrolled . " All I know about Washington and Jefferson is that they are both dead , " quipped one sportswriter . No one laughed after the game , though . Washington and Jefferson made no substitutions and held the incredulous University of California to a 0 to 0 tie . Of such stuff are Rose Bowl contenders made ! The Rose Bowl began making football history from the beginning and within only a few years was enough of a classic to warrant a stadium befitting its role in the American football tradition . When 41,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , Lay Leishman 's father W.L. told the incoming Tournament president that work had to begin on a new stadium because there would n't be enough lumber in the city to seat the crowds otherwise . Leishman would know . He was both the Tournament 's football expert and the city 's lumber dealer . The elder Leish man took his son Lay back east on a business trip to look over the Yale Bowl as " the kind of stadium we should have here someday for our football games . " So the Tournament built itself a stadium , horseshoe in shape and seating 57,000 . You could n't build a good-sized house today for what the original Rose Bowl cost . Ready ? $272,198.26 . Five years later , the circle was closed with another 19,000 seats bringing the total to 76,000 . In 1937 , 4,000 more seats were added ; and in 1949 the Rose Bowl was enlarged to its present size : 104,697 . It was a newspaperman , Harlan " Dusty " Hall , who dubbed the new stadium the " Rose Bowl " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tournament to help with publicity . USC won the first game in the new stadium in 1923 , beating Penn State 14 to 3 . The game had other claims to fame . Cal had been the Tournament 's first choice but had refused to play Penn State and its coach , Hugo Bezdek ( who was returning to Pasadena for his third time ) . Bezdek barred photographers from his practices , but the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner sneaked photos which they spread across their sports page the next day . Then Bezdek arrived late with his team , and LISC 's coach Elmer // " Gloomy Gus " Henderson was so angry that only bystanders prevented a fist fight between the two coaches . Henderson claimed Bezdek had stalled to let his players have the advantage of cooler temperatures . That first game in the Rose Bowl stadium finished by the light of the moon , with sportswriters and telegraph operators striking matches to finish their stories . Every Rose Bowl game has made history in its own way . Draw a huge circle around the 1925 Rose Bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game called football , perhaps the all-time classic . Undefeated Stanford faced undefeated Notre Dame . Stanford had the celebrated coach Glenn Scobie " Pop " Warner and a Six-Million-Dollar Man named Ernie Nevers . Notre Dame had the great , great coach Knute Rockne and a backfield that sportswriter Grantland Rice immortalized in the most famous of all football leads . . . the Four Horsemen : Stuhldreher , Miller , Crowley and Layden . They were no longer " outlined against a blue-grey October sky , " but against the post-season twilight of their brilliant careers , in their final game together . Pop Warner versus Knute Rockne . Ernie Nevers versus the Four Horsemen . What scalpers would n't get for those kinds of tickets today ! What they did n't get for them then ! Would you believe $50 for a $3 seat ? And one Hollywood director bragged of getting a block of eight $5 seats for $500 ( from a Notre Dame player , no less ) . The score went to Notre Dame 27 to 10 but Ernie Nevers chalked up one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other  --  series . It was n't just that he out-gained all four horsemen combined , carrying thirty-four times for 114 yards and a new Tournament record . It was n't that he handled the ball during every Stanford play in those pre-T days . It was n't even that he intercepted one of the eight Irish passes , or even that he was in on three out of four of his team 's tackles . It was that he wrote that unbelievable performance into the record books with two broken ankles and his legs taped so tightly that he had no feeling from his knees down ! There have n't been many Rocknes , Pop Warners , Horsemen or Ernie Neverses . There may never be another game like that 1925 Rose Bowl ! The Thirties had its moments . Pittsburgh brought four ( count ' em ) All-Americans to the Rose Bowl in 1930 , yet the University of Southern California set them back 47 to 14 in one of the worst drubbings in Rose Bowl history . In 1934 one of the most successful hidden ball plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barabas in a seventeen-yard scamper that left him completely untouched . One sportswriter quipped : " When he reached the fifteen-yard line , he stopped to chat with the little old lady who was sell-ing red apples . " Columbia won over Stanford that year 7 to 0 , on the soggiest of turfs . Seven fire departments had pumped a half million gallons out of the stadium after three days ' rain had inundated the Bowl and Arroyo Seco where it stands ( Arroyo Seco means dry wash ) . Stanford tried two more years in the mid-Thirties to win a Rose Bowl , becoming known as the " Vow Boys . " After losing to Columbia in the wet 1934 game , they lost to Alabama 29 to 13 in 1935 ( Tama 's future coach " Bear " Bryant played in that one ) , then finally won against Southern Methodist University 7 to 0 in 1936 . Stanford 's left tackle , Bob Reynolds , played all sixty minutes of all three vow games , for a Rose Bowl record that will probably never be broken in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game against Southern Methodist marked the only appearance of a Texas team in the Rose Bowl , and Texans of 1936 seemed to sense that it would be their only chance . Over 200,000 requests from Texans for tickets were turned down . Texas Governor James V. Allred was the Rose Parade 's grand marshal that year as Texas mania overtook Southern California . A hundred years after Texans lost the Alamo in 1836 to Mexicans , it lost the Rose Bowl in 1936 to Indians . In 1941 Stanford coach Clark Shaughnessy brought " T " to the Rose Bowl and the Rose Bowl infected the football world overnight . Shaughnessy later looked back on his 1941 backfield as one of football 's greatest : Frankie Albert , Pete Kmetovic , Hugh Gallarneau and Norm Standlee . Their greatness , coupled with their coach 's screwball gimmick for a football formation , pushed aside Nebraska 21 to 13 , and pushed aside the long snap from center , perhaps forever . The following year , 1942 , saw the nation at war , and a United States Army which saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close at hand . " Could they play a game just for 5,000 fans ? " The Army 's defense held : " No ! " " How about playing it just for the press ? Surely that would n't weaken our war effort . Just for the press ? How about it , Army ? " " No ! No ! No ! " The Army brass of 1942 played the most decisive defense in the history of the bowl . There would be no Rose Bowl game on a blacked-out West Coast . So , along with a lot of able-bodied Americans , the Rose Bowl packed up and left home because of the war . It moved to Duke Stadium , home of the Blue Devil team that had already been picked to meet Oregon State . The stadium was expanded from 35,000 to 56,000 in just over two weeks , and the programs for the game were rushed by train , arriving just as the gates opened for the game . Duke won 20 to 16 , as the only " home team " ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game has been played outside of Pasadena . During the rest of the war years , the Rose Bowl overcame the Army 's defense , and played the game to focus attention on the theme " Parade of War Bonds . " With the end of the war came the beginning of Western-Midwestern romance that has grown stronger with every tally of gate receipts . Actually , the Tournament people leaned toward Army for the 1946 game , and West Point wanted to come , but the Big Ten Conference was in session and they got Lay Leishman on the phone and told him it was now or never if he wanted a contract with their conference . Put up or shut up , and he had only a few hours to decide . In typical committee czar fashion he committed the Tournament to a deal with the West Coast and Midwest collegiate football conferences . In a way , it was retribution for the U.S. Army 's total defeat of the 1942 Rose Bowl , but many West Pointers bear a grudge to this day . Army had one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Outside , Davis and Blanchard . Had a commitment been broken by the Tournament ? Leishman says no . " Love had been made to Army , but no commitment . " So the West and Midwest married on January 1,1946 , with Army protesting from the pews , but the marriage has weathered thirty years and seems healthier today than ever . It 's not just inertia that keeps the Pac-Eight and Big Ten together . Southern Californians , for the most part , are immigrants from the heat and monotony of the Midwest . It was Indiana Hoosiers who founded the city of Pasadena and a Michigan team which had traveled to Pasadena in 1902 to play Stanford in the first Tournament of Roses classic . Leishman defends the arrangement vigorously . " The Midwest is the geographic center of the nation . The Mississippi River is the middle of the country . " He 's out to defend the shotgun wedding he committed himself to three.decades ago . No sooner had the contract been signed when the Big Ten slipped into the habit of trouncing whomever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to matter who came from the Midwest or who represented the West in Pasadena . For the rest of the Forties and all of the Fifties , the West won only one game , a 7 to 0 squeaker with U.S.C. over Wisconsin in 1953 . Before the 1940 's were over , many Westerners thought the Tournament had made a big , big mistake . In 1947 it was Illinois 45 to U.C.L.A. 14 . " The boys from Westwood went too far , " quipped one sportswriter . " They should have stopped off at Forest Lawn ! " The year 1948 was even worse for the West : Michigan humiliated U.S.C. 49 to 0 , in the worst defeat in the history of that football-obsessed school One newspaper observed , " A terrible thing happened here this afternoon . They threw the Trojans to .
