Takes Crack at Asked why the AFL-CIO chose to remain neutral after more than three years of villification of the Nixon administration , Meany replied , " because a man by the name of George got the nomination and we do n't think this man is good for labor . " Altho individual unions were given the go-ahead to back their Presidential choic e s , Meany made it clear that all state and city organizations such as the Illinois Federation of Labor and Chicago Federation of Labor must follow the AFL-CIO policy of neutrality .
