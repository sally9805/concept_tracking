" I feel like Orson Welles when he first came to Hollywood and cried , ' This is the most beautiful toy in the world . ' " So said French Theater Director Patrice Chreau , 31 , as he contemplated the prospect of staging the centennial celebration of the Bayreuth Festival with a new production of Der Ring des Nibelungen , Wagner 's longest , densest and most puzzling creation . The results were on display last week at the somber brick Festspielhaus , which Wagner himself designed , and they brought on a storm of booing deep and raw . A few people both booed and clapped at once . Shouting matches broke out between husbands and wives in splendid evening clothes . Some of the crowd had brought old-fashioned trainmen 's whistles , shrill enough to make a hound bay . Nonetheless , Chreau came out to take curtain calls , wearing blue jeans , a shiny mod belt and a patient smile . Said he later : " I was very amused at the booing . " <P> Bayreuth has known-and absorbed-protest before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wieland introduced the stark , abstract productions that have remained influential ever since . Wieland 's brother and successor , Wolfgang , knows his conservative local constituency very well-he staged an undistinguished Ring cycle of his own in 1971-but for the big five-week-long birthday he went out to hire men who would shake things up the way they must be shaken periodically if an opera house is to command international attention . <P> To conduct he chose Pierre Boulez , known for his readings of modern works but not particularly for his Wagner . He then approached Berlin 's Peter Stein to be director , and the word around Bayreuth is that the irreverent Stein proposed a Ring cycle without music . Wagner 's next pick , suggested by Boulez , was Chreau , the current enfant terrible of the Paris stage , whose only previous ventures into opera were an iconoclastic Tales of Hoffmann in Paris and Rossini 's L'ltaliana in Algeri at Spoleto . ( " You should watch this young man , " said Luchino Visconti , director of The Damned and Death in Venice , in 1969 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ) <P> Painful Fun . Chreau obviously does not want to be confined to either a realistic Ring or a symbolic one . Says he : " I do n't believe in pat solutions . What interests me in Wagner are the contradictions . " So he has staged the Ring largely in the " modern dress " of 1876 , the year of its first full performance . To that basic idea he has added touches of surrealistic humor . For example , the giants Fasolt and Fafner , who gain the magic ring in Das Rheingold in payment for building Valhalla , lumber around on the sagging shoulders of two local weight lifters hidden beneath their cloaks . This joke is painful fun , since Bass Bengt Rundgren , who plays Fafner , is 6 ft. 4 in. tall and weighs 300 lbs .
