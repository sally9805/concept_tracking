txt  | the use of antibiotics and hormones in commercially produced chickens and beef . They have sought to bypass these problems by buying organic chickens and meats , usually at very high prices such as $1 a pound for the chickens and $1.69 a pound for frankfurters . The proprietor of one organic farm , Wenger 's in Pennsylvania , advised us that the high prices are due to the additional care required ; the chickens are fed " no drugs , no antibiotics , no hormones . " Similarly , organic frankfurters have " no color added , no phosphates . " But even at their high prices they still are 26 percent fat , a little less than the shockingly high national average of 28 percent added fat in franks . While the other ingredients are listed as " pure beef , " there is no assurance that this is entirely from the more desirable parts of the animal or that the beef is organically produced . Carleton Fredericks testified at the New York City hearings on health foods that the problems of raising truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both exaggeration and undue alarm-raising are visible in the promotion of " organic " beef with such claims as the " animals are grazed on poison-free pastures . " Much of the fear of commercial beef stems from the use of DES to spur growth , and should be allayed now that the use of this hormone in cattle production has been curtailed , as explained in chapter 10 . All meat and poultry sold in interstate commerce , whether organic or commercial , must be inspected by the USDA and carry the U.S. inspection stamp . Despite flaws in U.S. inspection , and recent improvements in some state inspection standards , it may be safer to look for the U.S. inspection stamp . Raw Foods from Rational to Cultist Beliefs concerning the beneficial effects of raw foods are one of the most persistent strains in the health food movement , and range from mere misunderstanding of the usefulness of raw vegetable juices to extreme cults . The Hippocrates Health Institute in Boston , one of a number of rational raw food cults , asserts that up to 83 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , all food at the Institute , consisting of vegetables , fruits , sprouts , and seeds , is eaten raw .  | Another claim on behalf of raw foods by the Institute is that this is a way of reducing " inner pollution , " thus helping to " keep the environment clean on a very personal level . " The Institute also sends lecturers to health food stores to promote its " wheatgrass diet , " which is a commentary on either the integrity or nutritional knowledge of some of the proprietors . Such claims of almost total loss of nutrients in cooking are , of course , greatly exaggerated for the purposes of the cult promoters . Losses can be large in extreme cases of overlong cooking in too much water and with the use of inadequate utensils . Losses can be kept small using little water and so-called waterless cookers ( heavy-gauge ) with tight-fitting covers . The USDA 's Handbook No. 8 , Composition of Foods , shows , for example , 11,000 units of vitamin A in 3.5 ounces of raw carrots compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in raw cauliflower compared to 55 in cooked ; 240 units of vitamin A in raw celery compared to 230 in cooked . The difference in vitamin retention between cooking in small and large amounts of water is demonstrated by cabbage . Shredded cabbage cooked in little water has 33 milligrams of vitamin C for 3.5 ounces compared to 25 for wedges cooked in a large amount of water . Thus , while raw vegetables have an advantage in nutrient retention , it is not as great as sometimes claimed . Dr. William A. Sawyer , Medical Consultant for the Machinists ' Union , advised that a certain amount of raw fruits and vegetables is desirable , but cooked foods are more easily digested and less irritating to the stomach and the intestines . Too , in some foods carrots , for example cooking makes available more of the nutrients ( the carotene or vitamin A in this case ) . Less extreme but more pervasive than the raw food cults is the use of raw vegetable juices . The belief that the raw juices contain " life-giving " properties while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the New York Medical Society has said . Moreover , consuming only the juices loses some of the minerals and carotene and also the fiber , which is beneficial to bowel function . Another claim is made that consuming raw fruits and vegetables , especially raw vegetable juices , has some sort of restorative effect on the body because of the enzymes in the raw foods . Eleanor Williams , adjunct associate professor of nutrition at Co-  | lumbia and Mount Sinai Medical Schools , observed that this notion represents a basic misunderstanding about enzymes . She tes-tified : Enzymes are proteins which do , indeed , occur in raw foods . They are responsible for the aging of meat , for the ripening of fruit , for the flavor and texture of cheese , for the browning of an apple when ( cut ) , and for many other reactions in foods . The human body also needs enzymes , and uses them for all sorts of very important processes . We could not digest food without enzymes , nor could we obtain energy from the nutrients in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enzymes it needs ; it is not dependent on enzymes in foods . As a matter of fact , the human body can not utilize the enzymes in foods as such . The body treats enzymes in foods as it does any other protein ; it digests them . By that I mean it breaks the enzymes into the amino acids that make up the protein . The body then absorbs the amino acids and they are then indistinguishable from the same amino acids from any other protein source , be it meat , eggs , cereals , or beans . Therefore , the contention that raw vegetables or fruits , or their juices have health-giving properties because they provide the body with needed enzymes is entirely erroneous . Raw vegetables and fruits should be included in the diet because the vitamins are not subject to loss through cooking ; thus , the virtue in raw fruits and vegetables has to do with their vitamin and mineral content and not with the enzyme content , Dr. Williams advised . As far as the relative quality of protein in raw versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PER ) is much the same ( see chapter 5 for further discussion of the PER in various foods ) . Dr. Jean Mayer also has warned that some raw food fads may expose eaters to a greater degree of bacterial contamination , as in the case of raw eggs which may have salmonella organisms , or raw ground meat used in " Tartar sandwiches " which may have beef tapeworm or , in the case of pork , trichinosis . As noted in chapter 3 , apple juice with " no sugar or preservative added " has become widely used among many young people . Some also use it as a breakfast beverage , perhaps in the erroneous belief that it has as much nutrition as citrus and tomato juices . This is a risky notion . One hundred grams ( 3.5 ounces ) of orange juice provides 45 milligrams of vitamin C ; of grapefruit juice , 34% rams ; of tomato juice , 16 ; of apple juice , I. In fact ,  | apple juice has little nutritional value except for potassium and a small amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Cheek , Inc. , said it does not use organic apples . It had tried some but was not satisfied with the quality of the juice . Sprouts ? The New Manna Sprouts , grown from beans and seeds , have become the new wonder food of the food revolution . They have been called everything from " manna from heaven " to " the only food that we can consume humanely while the life force is still vibrant . " Some of the expanding interest in sprouts stems from the fact that seeds or grains can be sprouted at home either in special seed sprouters or even in jars . It is true , even discounting the claims for " life force , " that some of the vitamins in beans are increased by sprouting . Here is a comparative table supplied by Ruth Le-figure The results of sprouting certainly are not sensational . There even is a reduction in protein , the costlier nutrient , and in iron , often a nutrient in short supply . Soybean sprouts do have more protein and vitamin value than mung sprouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as iron , calcium , vitamins A  | and C , and some of the B vitamins , as do spinach , kale , broccoli , and several other green and yellow vegetables . Compare , for example , the 2 milligrams of iron , 5,100 units of vitamin A , and the 111 milligrams of ascorbic acid in a cup of cooked broccoli spears with the same vitamins in the sprouted mung beans . Alfalfa ? Cows Pay Less Some of the most imaginative prices for supplements are those charged for alfalfa tablets . At $1.30 a bottle of 250 tablets , I calculated that this is the equivalent of paying approximately $1.30 a pound for dried alfalfa . Cows get it for much less . But then , they need it more . Eleanor Williams offered a special criticism of extract of alfalfa sold to aid the body in " combating toxic substances related to system illnesses . " She noted that one manufacturer claims that the fat-soluble vitamins in this product ( vitamins A and K ) are the factors of greatest value in " combating toxic factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would support such a claim , and such claims are in my opinion grossly misleading to the consumer , " Dr. Williams testified . Alfalfa is considered a " superfood " by some of its fans . Robert Rodale , a leading enthusiast , says that " millions of fragrant green alfalfa tablets are turned out monthly and sold in health food stores . " He lauds alfalfa as having " spectacular mineral and vitamin values , " and for being high in protein too . Alfalfa has a protein content of 15 to 20 percent ; " better than wheat " which has only 13 percent on average , Rodale notes . But what he neglects to also say is that vegetable protein in general is incomplete protein ( lacking in some essential amino acids ) , and does not have either the nutritional or economic value of protein from animal sources . Moreover , if alfalfa provides only a little more incomplete protein than wheat , there seems no rational reason to pay the high prices for alfalfa tablets . It seems even more ridiculous to pay more for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete protein foods .  | VEGANS AND PROTEIN-EATERS FROM SENSE TO LENS THE SURPRISINGLY STRONG STRAIN of vegetarianism today among young people , especially , does have some useful economic and social values , if not necessarily health benefits , but in extreme cases poses proven dangers . Some young people have become partial vegetarians or vegans ( complete , strict vegetarians ) , because of revulsion against red meat or the idea of slaughter . Candice Bergen , the actress , explained , " I want to be able to look a cow in the eye . " 44 Others , with no wish or even opportunity to look a cow in the eye , have become " vegans " for spiritual reasons , as in the macrobiotic cult , for ecological reasons , or simply to lose weight . For many the inducement has been exaggerated claims for curative powers , and a misconception that " whole " grains actually can provide a whole diet . The word " whole " can be a fooler . Only foods from animal sources are complete in all the essential amino acids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is the food of muscles , blood , skin , and hair . There are twenty-two amino acids . Eight are considered essential since the body can synthesize the others . But the eight " essential " ones must be provided by your food . The names of the amino acids often are bandied about by health foodists so you may as well know what they are talking about . They are : leucine and isoleucine ( which influence the function of digestive enzymes ) ; lysine ( which aids in the assimilation of the other amino acids ) ; methionine ( associated with fat metabolism ) ; phenylalanine ( associated ss  | with utilization of vitamin C and production of thyroxin , a hormone ) ; tryptophane ( associated with utilization of B vitamins ) ; threonine ( aids in building body tissues and in utilization of nutrients ) ; valine ( associated with the nervous system ) . Two others considered semiessential by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) are cystine and tryosine . As the table of comparative protein facts in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds , and legumes are high in amino acids ? even almost complete . Soybeans and its derived products are the most complete of the plant foods . Because of the varying amino acid content and the varying protein utilization determined by the digestibility and biological value of the food , different protein foods vary in what is called their " protein efficiency ratio ( PER ) . " This ratio is based on the weight gain per gram of protein intake as determined in tests on rats by various researchers . In the table of comparative protein facts in this chapter , we have extracted from a landmark FAO report the PER for various animal foods and grains . A protein-rich food does not necessarily have a high PER . Thus , gelatine is almost entirely protein , but it is low-quality protein because it is low in amino acids . So gelatine has a very low PER . White flour also has low-quality protein . Eggs have the highest PER and often are used as the standard or reference quality protein against which the other foods are measured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some researchers . Not only do the foods from animal sources and fish usually have the highest PER , but they also provide the most protein in relation to the amount of calories you have to take on board to get protein . Fish and chicken have the highest ratio of protein to calories . Several plant foods also have high ratios , including soybean products , lentils , mung and lima beans , chick peas , sunflower seeds , and some of the ground nuts . The protein to calorie ratio is not listed for all foods . In what is one of the more realistic and thorough books on almost-vegetarianism , Diet for a Small Planet , Frances Moore Lappe points out that some legumes and grains are high in protein , and even if the amino acids are incomplete , they can complement each other . Mrs. Lappe provides a calculation method for  | the conversion of nonmeat protein into beef equivalent by combining , for example , beans and rice , which complement each other.45 There are sound personal and social reasons for reducing our huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Henry C. Sherman of Columbia University , probably our broadest thinking nutritionist of the 1940 's and ' 50 's , we devote a great deal of money and labor growing grains , which we feed to animals , and we then eat the animals . We also devote vast areas and additional labor to maintain the animals . In other countries , people mostly eat grains supplemented by small amounts of animal food . The use of a little meat , chicken , fish , eggs , or milk products with a lot of vegetables and grain products is noticeable in the much-admired Oriental and Italian cuisines , and in some French dishes . Heavy use of animal products also increases pollution . The meat hunger of Americans has been a prime factor in successive inflations with such phenomena as housewives ' picketlines , labor demands for higher pay , Congressional inquiries , and White House economic game plans . ( When President Nixon went to China in 1972 my own suspicion was that he really was looking for low-meat Chinese recipes to get off the inflation hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's analysis with her own impressively documented plea to get off " the top of the food chain . " The conversion and complementary methods she offers are somewhat complicated although they can be learned . But her own approach is not wholly vegetarian . Her recipes also provide for the use of milk and eggs , two foods from animal sources complete in amino acids . Other partial vegetarians also use fish . In general , a vegetarian diet can be safe if it includes some complete protein such as fish , cheese , milk , and eggs . From the viewpoint of economics and conservation , a largely vegetarian diet that includes chicken is economically rational , if you are not worried about looking a chicken in the eye . Chickens are the most efficient grain converters , yielding a pound of gran , for two and a half pounds of feed . ; j What has concerned doctors and almost all nutritionists is the well-publicized tendency of some groups , mainly young people , to  | rely mainly on such foods as brown rice . Very strict vegetarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as brown rice , are likely to lack B vitamins , especially B12 . Also , these diets are usually deficient in protein , although a mixed diet consisting of several plant foods such as grains , legumes , and nuts with complementary amino acid patterns is safe . Whether brown or not , rice is a relatively low-protein food , as the table of nutrients in the appendix shows . Almost two pounds of rice in dry weight , or about sixteen cups cooked , are needed to fill the normal adult need of about 60 grams of protein a day . Even then , this copious intake would be incomplete protein , lacking in some of the essential amino acids . As one of many possible examples , cheddar cheese provides almost four times as much complete protein for the same weight . Nor will chewing each mouthful of brown rice thirty times put any more protein in it . Whole grain diets also are likely to be seriously deficient in vitamins A and C and in iron , although some of the latter-day macrobiotic followers say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits , and other grains than just rice . Some now even include seafood and cheese in their diet . Thus , Gerald Cook reported , macrobiotic restaurants like the Paradox in New York City also provide fish dishes as well as brown rice , miso soup , and other Yin and Yang dishes . Other dishes often served by vegetarian restaurants include eggplant fried in sesame seeds and spun soy " chicken " breasts . The mystical brown rice is not as high in nutrition as many other grains and legumes . Among the more nutritionally useful plant foods , both because they are higher in protein and its utilization by the body , are soybean products , wheat germ , white beans , lima beans , mung beans , peas , lentils , chick peas , and nuts . Oatmeal , while it has less protein than the foregoing , still is among the relatively high protein cereals and is exceptionally high in PER , exceeded only by wheat germ in this group . Noodles , spaghetti , and barley also are higher in protein than rice . Enriched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several other nutrients than ordinary polished rice . Parboiled or " converted " rice is rice that has been steamed or heated and dried in the hull before milling . Some of the vitamins and minerals in the bran and hull thus permeate the endosperm ,  | giving the parboiled rice more vitamin content than white milled rice . This kind of rice has a yellow color . Some of the natural antioxidants , however , are destroyed in the parboiling or converting so that unless antioxidants are added parboiled rice tends to become rancid more quickly . Most rice bought is the milled white rice produced by rubbing off the outer layers of the grain which also , unfortunately , rubs off some of the nutrients in the whole grain . Thus , much white rice is enriched to restore some of the niacin , thiamin , and iron lost in processing . Some milled white rice is coated with talc and glucose to give it a polished appearance . This talc must be washed off before using the rice . But then some nutrients are washed off too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edible coating that adds nutrients and does not need to be washed off . Another problem associated with talc-coated polished rice is that asbestos particles have been found in the talc . In late 1972 the FDA had proposed a rule that talc used in food must be free of asbestos . Lentils are a favored food of vegetarians as a meat substitute and of health foodists in general . As the table shows they are high in protein , but not high in the efficiency with which the body uses it Ohsawa made incredible claims for the therapeutic value of macrobiotic diets and for their ability to prolong life . He divided foods into two groups ? Yin , for female , and Yang , for masculine . These , he advised , should be kept in balance . Men should avoid too much Yin food like eggplant and yogurt ; women should avoid too much Yang food like eggs and apples . The real danger arises from the various levels of diets Ohsawa prescribes for his followers in their search for a state of well-being and a clear mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cereal diet , consisting mostly of brown rice . As was widely reported at the time , a twenty-fouryear-old New Jersey woman who was subsisting on the all-cereal level actually starved to death in 1965 . She weighed seventy pounds when she died . Some publications have mentioned " several deaths " but without specific details . Ruth Leverton cited cases of scurvy , anemia , emaciation , and loss of kidney function due to restricted fluid intake among zealous followers of extreme macrobiotic diets. "  | Too , Boston pediatrician Dr. Gerald Hass reported that children being brought up on macrobiotic diets , whom he has treated at the South End Community Health Center , were small in height and weight compared to nonmacrobiotic middle-class children of the same age.47 Such diets are considered to be especially risky for teen-agers whose tissue is still developing . Yogi diets , too , exclude meat on the theory that it is not pure spirit and clouds the mind , a theory I have tried to test on myself with no tangible results . One of the largest groups of vegetarians is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompatible with maintaining " health and physical purity . " 48 Their Loma Linda packaged soybeans and other products now are widely bought by other vegetarians . They claim that their life span and cardiovascular health exceeds that of other groups , but it should be noted that they also abstain from tobacco and liquor . Ohsawa and some of his followers promised fantastic health cures for his diets . In 1966 , quantities of foods used in Zen macrobiotic diets were seized by the Food and Drug Administration together with promotional books and pamphlets . The FDA considered the foods illegally labeled by virtue of " false and misleading claims " in the promotional literature . The claims included representations that the foods , mostly grain products , were effective in preventing and treating more than eight diseases and conditions when used in macrobiotic diets . The conditions listed in the pamphlets included anemia , arthritis , appendicitis , cancer , cataracts , tuberculosis , diabetes , epilepsy , heart disease , hernia , leprosy , polio , and schizophrenia . In his widely sold book , Zen Macrobiotics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) be cured in ten days or a few weeks . " 49 He further explained that baldness is caused by too much Yin ( feminine ) food ; that no macrobiotic person can be affected by gonorrhea or any other venereal disease ; that aspirin is suicidal , and that even the microbe is his own doctor . But the FDA seizure has merely served to make macrobiotic promoters more careful about what they commit to print . Five years later , Reva T. Frankle testified at the New York City health foods hearings that she enrolled in a macrobiotic cooking class and heard many curative claims  --  for example , that macrobiotic diets could cure arthritis.  | On the other hand , there is no virtue in overconsuming protein . Home economist Mary Ruth Nelson pointed out that with adequate caloric intake and more protein than the body needs , any excess nitrogen will be excreted but the body will save the non-nitrogen part ( carbon ) and store it as extra fat.50 Comparative Protein Facts* figure  | figure  | foods listed . FAO data are averages . Different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meats is greater as between lean and fat cuts . For example , bacon ( raw ) may have only 7 to 9 grams of protein per 100 grams , but trimmed lean cuts of ham , loin , shoulder may have 15 to 16 grams ( medium-fat class , raw ) . After cooking , the protein content of pork have 15 to 16 grams ( medium-fat class , raw ) . After cooking , the protein content of pork per 100 grams is usually about 50 percent higher , and a little under 50 percent higher for beef . This is not gelatine dessert powder , which has less protein : 9.4 grams per 100 grams as purchased , or 1.5 when made with water into dessert . " ? ' When protein content is listed for raw or dry items , the protein content when cooked usually is about one-third the amount . Thus for mature soybean seeds , the FAO and USDA handbooks list 34 to 38 grams in the raw form but 11 grams cooked , because of the increase in water content .  | FATS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern ove heart conditions haunting the American public has spurred pur chases of various " health " food oils and other products such a lecithin and linoleic acid . The claims made for these products are as large as the profs margins on them . Lecithin ( pronounced les-i-thin ) has been rec ommended by health writers and sellers not only to protec against heart disease by combating cholesterol deposits , bu sometimes also for arthritis , high blood pressure , gall bladde complications associated with diet , coronary thrombosis , and H improve brain power and stamina . Jane Kinderlehrer , a Rodal editor who recommends a number of products to increase virility including halvah , also suggests lecithin for this purpose . But the principal reason people have been buying lecithin it every form ( oil , capsules , chewable wafers , tablets ) , by itself am in combination with other food supplements and vitamins , is be cause of cholesterol fears . Lecithin is one of a group of fatlike substances called phospho lipids ( see Glossary ) . It is an emulsifying agent occurring natural ly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fron soybeans . When manufactured in liquid form , lecithin usually i combined with fish oils providing vitamins A and D , with soy of as the carrier . In tablet form , the base usually is bone meal flout and nonfat dry milk solids . Since lecithin is water soluble and can function to put fats into 65  | solution , it often is used as an emulsifying additive in many foods such as mayonnaise , salad dressings , chocolate candies , and margarine to maintain the stability of the oil ingredient . Lecithin also is an emulsifier and so is used by food processors as an additive . The theory of the sellers and users of lecithin as a food supplement is that lecithin breaks up and disperses cholesterol in the blood so that the cholesterol does not become attached to artery walls . But many doctors and nutritionists do not believe that is necessary to consume additional supplies , or that lecithin will function as the lecithin users believe . Glen Shue has explained the reasons for these doubts : ( 1 ) fats almost universally are found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecithin will further affect their sol-ubility ; ( 2 ) lecithin is a normal metabolizing factor in the body , and the body makes its own lecithin ( in the liver ) so there is no reason to believe that additional intake is necessary . Eating more is like feeding more vitamin C to a rat . The rat does not need it . Dr. Eleanor Williams , at the New York City health food hearings , strongly criticized the sale of lecithin products . She testified that " controlled studies " have indicated that lecithin itself has no effect in lowering the blood cholesterol level . The exact mechanism by which cholesterol becomes deposited in arteries is not known , and therefore it is " misleading " to assert that eating lecithin will prevent such deposits . Other heart specialists also have confirmed that lecithin has not been found to prevent atherosclerosis . Roger J. Williams , often quoted by the health food disciples in support of some of their beliefs , says researchers have found that consuming more lecithin " is a useful preventive measure . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent " can be promoted ( through lipotropic agents such as methionine , choline , and inositol ) .51 Is there any harm in eating additional lecithin ? Nutritionists in general do not have any evidence of risk . " There is no evidence that lecithin is healthful or harmful , or that lecithin is effective in dispersing cholesterol , " Betty Laif , Nutritionist for the Chicago Board of Health reported.52 The trend of current medical thinking is to encourage use of  | unsaturated fats such as liquid vegetable oil rather than saturated ( hardened ) fats like butter , solid margarine , shortening , and coconut oil , in order to maintain a low cholesterol level . For example , Dr. Helen Brown of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation has said that the substitution of unsaturated for saturated fats is the principal treatment that can be safely used for reduction of blood lipids ( although drugs may be of additional help in some conditions ) . She cites the reduced incidence of coronary artery disease in persons who have maintained a low cholesterol level with fat controlled diets for five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blood cholesterol level , and cardiovascular disease remains a matter of debate , the Intersociety Commission for Heart Disease Resources has recommended , on the basis of available data , that Americans should reduce their current consumption of cholesterol and saturated fats by 50 percent and should substantially lower their intake of all fats . The medical encouragement to use unsaturated fats in place of saturated has led to the promotion of special " cold pressed " and other oils of plant origin in health food stores . There are now a wide variety of these , including avocado , safflower , soy , sunflower , sesame , almond , apricot kernel , as well as the more common corn , olive , and cottonseed oils . They usually cost two or three times as much as similar oils in supermarkets ; for example , 98 cents a pint for corn oil ; $1.40 for sesame ; $4.50 for avocado ; $1.25 for sunflower . Especially prized are the oils high in linoleic acid , an essential unsaturated fatty acid . ( A fatty acid is part of a fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vital functions in the body , such as maintaining the skin in healthy condition , Ruth Leverton explained . Moreover , linoleic acid appears to be the only acid that the body can not synthesize and must be obtained from food sources . Many ordinary cooking or salad oils , however , have useful amounts of linoleic acid , including corn , cottonseed , and soy oils . Wheat germ , too , is a good source . Safflower and sesame oils also are rich in linoleic acid but are more expensive and not as widely available at supermarket prices . Peanut oil and olive oils , poultry fat and fish oil have lower contents of linoleic acid . Margarines and shortenings differ in  | their content , depending on the raw materials used and the extent to which they are hydrogenated ( hardened ) . Is it possible to use too much of these oils ? Certainly from the viewpoint of calorie control it may be . While replacing saturated fats with unsaturated has been shown to reduce cholesterol in the blood , another factor in cholesterol levels is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exercise , the late Dr. Norman Jolliffe advised . Some preliminary investigations also have raised some very tentative questions about heavy use . One research project on rats at the University of Nebraska Medical School found that rats fed diets high in unsaturated fats did not learn as rapidly as those fed diets lower in unsaturated fat . The U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1971 awarded the school a grant for a more extended study , now in progress , on the effect of unsaturated fats on reproduction , physical development of the young , intelligence , and the aging process . Nutritionists at the USDA Human Nutrition Research Division have said that under certain conditions increasing the unsaturated fat in the diet can even raise , rather than reduce , blood cholesterol levels . A vitamin E deficiency also may contribute to deleterious effects of unsaturated fats , Roger J. Williams noted54 ( further discussed in chapter 7 ) . Thus , and even though Adelle Davis generalizes , " from cases I have seen . . . deficiencies of essential fatty acids are widespread , " and suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , you may wish to proceed judiciously and perhaps in consultation with your doctor.5S The Bureau of Nutrition of the New York City Department of Health , a pioneer in developing low-fat diets , notes that a fat is never exclusively one type but a combination of saturated , polyunsaturated , and monounsaturated . All three are found in foods in varying amounts and proportions . Monounsaturated fats have little effect on cholesterol . This is how the Bureau classifies fats in its pamphlet , The Prudent Diet ( see References ) :  | figure  | NATURAL VITAMINS AND UNNATURAL KIDDING IN ALMOST EVERY STORE nowadays , and in many publications , you are confronted by pressures to buy vitamin products , especially the high-priced " natural " ones which often really are only partially made from natural substances . Fear tactics and part truths are widely used . One working man wrote to me : " I was visited by a vitamin supplement salesman who supported his claims with government reports on poor soil , cooking of foods , storage , organic vs. inorganic farming , etc . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , I could n't see spending twenty dollars a month on vitamins . " Can we get all we need out of foods ? Should we all eat raw instead of cooked vegetables ? What about white sugar and white flour ? Are they harmful ? " Some of these questions are discussed in other chapters . But , in general , people who have no abnormality and do eat a balanced diet should be able to get their needed nutrients without taking additional vitamins . Anyone who does have a physical condition should consult a doctor . He would determine what vitamins , if any , are needed . Many vitamin sellers also exploit guilt feelings especially those of young mothers who fear the meals they give their families are not balanced . As one young mother told researcher Evelyn Spindler : 71  | . . . I know there are times when their meals are n't balanced , then I give all five of us vitamins because I know they are not getting all they should for that day . Another mother said : We take them sporadically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will give them some vitamins , but there is no routine to it.56 This nutritional " insurance " idea is , of course , one of the main promotional drives of the vitamin industry and of the popular health food writers such as Adelle Davis , Carleton Fredericks , and Linda Clark . Judging from her own recital , Adelle Davis takes about ten different vitamin supplement pills a day ( some of them combinations ) .57 These include some substances which are widely present in ordinary foods or are of unverified significance . Her rationale for her extraordinarily strong pitch for vitamin supplements is that " even when junk foods are avoided , it is difficult to meet all body requirements unless one can obtain produce grown organically on fertile soils . " Most nutritionists and soil scientists dispute such sweeping generalizations . Nor , in fact , is produce " grown organically on fertile soil " any insurance of adequate nutrition , as discussed in chapter 11 . The only logical insurance is a balanced , varied diet providing the needed nutrients and including foods which come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one area would be compensated for . What really is a " balanced " diet ? The USDA advises using some foods every day from four basic groups . Some nutritionists think the USDA has oversimplified the seven basic groups it used to recommend . Marcella Katz , nutrition consultant for the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York , in the Public Affairs pamphlet , Vitamins , Food , and Your Health , recommends using some foods each day from these six groups : 1 . Meat , fish , eggs , poultry , legumes , supply high-quality protein that contains an adequate amount of amino acids. 2 . Breads and cereals , whole grain and enriched , supply sugar and starch , vitamins , and minerals . ( The protein in grain cereals is not complete and should he used in combination with the complete proteins in Groups 1 and 3. ) 3 . Milk and milk products such as cheese supply high-quality  | protein , minerals , and vitamins . 4 . Dark-green leafy and yellow vegetables are important sources of vitamin A. 5 . Other vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , potatoes ? are important sources of vitamin C. 6 . Fats and oils , especially liquid vegetable oils and margarine made from them , rather than the so-called " saturated " or hard fats . It is true that some vitamins are lost in food processing and in home cooking , although vitamin sellers sometimes exaggerate these losses . Vegetables washed in too much water or left in the pot too long before serving " make vitamin-rich water and vitamin-poor food , " Ms. Katz warns . She points out that many families rarely use the cooking water . They should . Vegetables should be cooked in as little water as possible and for as short a time as feasible . Any remaining water can be used in gravies , sauces , and soups . It also is true , as discussed in other chapters , that many grains and cereals lose some of their nutrients in processing ? including white rice , white bread , noodles and cereals . Enrichment of some of these products ( not all are enriched ) does restore some of the nutrients sometimes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over white bread , for one example , shows how the consumer can protect himself against excessive loss of nutrients in processing . With care in planning and cooking , most people should not need vitamin supplements . Those who do or feel they do , need not choose the high-priced products being promoted . For example , in a survey we found prices for a bottle of 100 tablets of 100 milligrams of vitamin C varied from 45 cents to as much as $1.75 for so-called " natural " vitamin C ( often partly i synthetic ) . The high prices are unnecessary , especially for synthetic is vitamin C. The factory cost of 100 tablets of 100 milligrams actually is only 4 cents . Similarly , different brands of multivitamins with minerals sell for anywhere from $2.65 to $4.50 . They have somewhat varying formulas , which makes it hard for consumers to compare values precisely , but are basically analogous products . For B vitamins , although with varying formulas , you can pay anywhere from 79 cents to $3.79 for 100 tablets . For more price comparisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter . As shown in chapter 2 , there are big profits in vitamins , especially the natural kind . For example , a large basic supplier like General Mills sells vitamin E ( the current fad vitamin ) to packagers for 50 to 78 cents for 100 tablets or capsules of 100 International Units . Assuming a cost of 78 cents per 100 , the packager adds on 12 cents for transportation , overhead , and profit , and another 20 cents for bottling . He then sells the bottle of 100 vitamin E tablets to a jobber for $1.10 . The jobber may take as much as 25 percent of the suggested retail price . If , for example , the suggested retail price is $3 , the jobber 's margin would be 75 cents and he sells the vitamin E to the retailer for $1.85 . In the case of health food stores the retailer 's margin usually is 40 percent of the suggested retail price , or about $1.20 , unless he decides to add on a little more than the normal 40 percent , as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the retail counters they have price tags of anywhere from $1.95 for private brands sold by large retailers , to as much as $3.50 for nationally known brands . A large food manufacturer like General Mills enjoys the best of all possible business worlds . General Mills sells many of the highly processed and " fun foods " often overloaded with empty calories and/or additives , such as Kaboom , Count Chocula , Betty Crocker 's Noodles Romanoff , and Hamburger Helper , as well as the much-criticized white flour . Having milled out some of the vitamin value from the grains they process , General Mills then sells it back to the public in the form of vitamin E concentrates , wheat germ oil , and multivitamins . There is an excellent chance that many of the natural vitamins health foodists buy , no matter what the brand name , really come from your friendly giant miller . Health foodists are being gulled from one side as much as empty-calorie chewers are from the other . Vitamin packagers nowadays use a number of ways to build up prices : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 250 and even 500 milligram tablets , in order to command higher prices . For example , someone convinced he needs vitamin E might pay $3.30 per 100 tablets for the basic potency of 100 International Units . But if he comes to believe that if a little is  | good , a lot must be better ( which can be fallacious ) , he may be led to buy potencies of as much as 500 I.U. 's at $12 per 100 tablets . And that 's for just one kind of vitamin . In early 1973 , as this was written , the FDA proposed limited restraints on the sale of vitamin products as dietary supplements . Certain products exceeding 150 percent of the RDA may now have to be sold as drugs , depending on the final form of the proposed legislation . ? They package these higher potencies in smaller counts such as 50 or 60 or even only 30 tablets in a bottle instead of the traditional 100 , in order to make the higher prices seem lower . ? They try to influence people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy not only specific vitamins to supplement their supposedly " impoverished " food supply , but also other supplements to balance the nutrients in the first supplement . Dr. Eleanor Williams testified at the New York City hearings on health foods in 1972 : One manufacturer has a B-Complex supplement in one bottle , and in another there is something called Choline-Plus which contains factors that can also be classified as belonging to the BComplex vitamins . The B-Complex consists of all those water soluble vitamins found in yeast . In this case , the manufacturer recommends that the consumer buy both bottles of vitamins . . .. This same advertiser shows many combinations in his advertising : liver extract along with a protein-digesting enzyme he calls " peptain " ; crude oils from germs of cereals along with vitamin E ; bioflavonoids along with vitamin C ; vitamin A along with lecithin . By the advertising the consumer is led to believe that the two belong together in some way and that he should buy both , not just one . They push the higher-priced " natural " vitamins instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same in function , and the supposedly natural ones are partly synthetic in any case . ( If they were not they would be too big to swallow . ) ? They lead the consumer to believe he is getting higher potencies than he actually is . Traditionally , vitamin potencies are indicated in terms of the minimum daily requirement of each nutrient per tablet . But some of the natural brands now list the amounts for several tablets ; for example , the relative MDR potencies per three tablets ( one for each meal ) .  | The need for the bigger dosages is highly controversial even within the health food movement , and has drawn fire from one of the largest natural-vitamin manufacturers Schiff . This company charged that " huge dosages " are " for the sake of promotion . . . the body can not absorb them and therefore ( they ) are not utilized . " Adelle Davis wrote that she takes 200 or 300 units of vitamin E , 500 milligrams or more of vitamin C , 25,000 units of vitamin A and 2,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily dietary allowance ( RDA ) as shown in Appendix C is 5,000 units of vitamin A even for teen-agers and adults ( except pregnant and lactating women ) , and even less for children . There are dangers in overconsumption of some vitamins . Taking excess amounts of A and D is " unwarranted and potentially dangerous , " 59 as the American Medical Association puts it . ( Nor is there any point to arguing that the AMA must be in the pay of non-vitamin manufacturers . ) The problem is that the body ca n't excrete vitamins A and D as it can others such as vitamin C. The AMA warned : Chronic vitamin A intoxication occurs more frequently in children than in adults . Depending upon the severity of the intoxication , children may develop loss of appetite , weight loss , irritability , fissuring at the corners of the mouth , and cracking and bleeding of the lips . . . . Later signs include liver enlargement , loss of hair , and severe bone and joint pains . There is great variation in individual tolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continued ingestion of excessive quantities ( including ) age , exposure to ultraviolet light , dietary calcium , and hormone excretion . With excessive intakes of vitamin D , nausea , polyuria , and diarrhea are early symptoms of toxicity . Later symptoms include weakness , the deposition of calcium in soft tissues , and depression . As the result of expressions of concern , the FDA late in 1972 proposed limiting the amount of vitamins A and D that manufacturers could put in over-the-counter vitamin products to 10,000 and 400 International Units . The government agency pointed out that some vitamin A products then on the market had ten times the recommended daily allowance and some vitamin D products had sixty times the RDA . The regulation , expected to go into effect in 1973 as this was written , would not affect physicians ' prescriptions of high dosages for specific patients .  | Nutritional authorities became especially concerned when Dr. Robert E. Cooke , chief pediatrician at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the mid-1960s , made public reports linking certain types of mental retardation in children with excessive intake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical authorities have also stated that excess vitamin D can produce mental confusion and other distresses in adults.60 Some authorities believe that incidents of illnesses from-excessive intakes of vitamins A and D over a period of time are due to use of concentrated sources of the vitamins . Not enough occurs naturally in foods to be toxic , pointed out Thelma J. McMillan , Professor of Food and Nutrition at Iowa State University.61 At least so far . Getting the proper amount of vitamins A and D can be a problem . You can easily not get enough , and you can also get too much . Most recently nutritionists have become concerned that so much vitamin A and D is being added to processed foods , often as a promotional device , that an excess may be possible even without taking vitamin pills . Food manufacturers now are adding A and D to breakfast cereals , various beverages and beverage powders such as synthetic breakfast drinks and chocolate powder . As I. pointed out in The Great American Food Hoax , many ready-to-eat cereals now are little more than sugarcoated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief risks of overconsumption . However , some warnings against very high consumption of vitamin C have appeared in the wake of Linus Pauling 's widely publicized claim that massive doses of this vitamin could prevent or minimize colds . One such warning has come from Charles Glen King , who led the team that isolated vitamin C in 1932 . Dr. King , who certainly should know at least as much about his discovery as anyone else , advised that ( 1 ) we do not know the effects on the human system of massive doses of vitamin C , for no one has done any definitive experiments with a large controlled group , but ( 2 ) we do know that excessive C causes the body to form oxalic acid , an ingredient in some kidney stones , especially those associated with gout.6z FDA also has warned that too much vitamin C may be dangerous and cause diarrhea . Some concern also has been expressed about overconsumption of vitamin B , 2 . An official of the New York State Health Depart-  | ment reported in 1962 that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been discovered in one county and stopped by the county medical society , and that " excessive " injections by doctors were dangerous because they could mask certain neurological systems . Because of the popularity of large amounts of vitamin E , concern has been voiced over the possibility of harm from such megadoses . Most authorities say to date there have been no known instances of harm . For example , Dr. Orrea Pye told me : " I do n't think it is necessary to take additional vitamin E , and I have always been concerned about people taking too much of it . But it seems to be so unstable in the system that we do n't have any evidence at the present time of any danger . " Vitamin K has been reported to be toxic in large amounts and also riboflavin in very high doses . Nicotinic acid , another of the B vitamins , can be toxic , Seelig noted.63 In recent years , Adelle Davis has come under an increasing and often angry backlash from most other nutritionists and doctors for her recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Allan Forbes of FDA demanded to know why she recommended taking up to 50,000 units of vitamin A for visual problems when excessive amounts are stored and can cause disorders . He pointed out that a teen-ager might undergo a brain operation for a suspected tumor when it was really " a vitamin A high . " According to Washington Star writer Carol Weissert , and confirmed by others in attendance , Ms. Davis , as was the case in a number of criticisms , did not attempt to defend her recommendation . She said : " I will accept your criticism and watch carefully and take it seriously . " 64 ( In proposing , late in 1972 , limitations on dosages of vitamins A and D in over-the-counter products the FDA itself warned that excessive amounts of vitamin A taken over long periods can increase pressure within the skull and " may mimic a brain tumor . " ) Some minerals also may be toxic in very large amounts , notably . As with vitamins A and D , the consumer needs to walk a cautious path between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most often in short supply , especially in the diets of young children and menstruating females , but overconsumption over long periods can be harmful . According to government nutritionists , the allowance of 18 mil-  | ligrams of iron per day recommended for women is almost impossible to obtain through ordinary foods . Thus , supplementation is often required . Many foods for example , breakfast cereals ? are being fortified with iron at increasingly higher levels to meet a woman 's needs.65 One reason given for a shortage of iron is that most Americans no longer use iron cooking utensils . Increased use of snack foods and carbonated beverages instead of fruit juices also is cited . In testing infant foods for their content of trace elements essential to human health , the FDA noted in its 1971 annual report that some were found to be deficient in copper , others in zinc , but most of them in iron . Vitamin and mineral sellers have seized upon the publicity concerning the rising incidence of anemia to promote iron pills on television and other hard-sell advertising media . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But use of iron pills should be approached cautiously , especially in the case of high dosages . It is safer and more economical to get your iron through foods . The table of recommended daily allowances in Appendix C shows the typical needs of different individuals . The list of foods rich in iron in this chapter , and the list of nutrients in Appendix D , show the amount of iron provided by various foods . As an example of how a balanced diet can correct irondeficiency anemia , the army reported that personnel in basic training in 1970-71 showed " surprisingly high prevalence of anemia " of an iron-deficient nature among both young men and women . But after a year of the " well-balanced military diet , " the army data revealed a significant decrease in the anemia prevalence rates . Some sellers of iron preparations have made especially broad claims about " tired blood " and tiredness symptoms . The Federal Trade Commission carried on a running battle all through the 1960 's against claims by the J. B. Williams Company for Geritol , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge that these iron and vitamin syrups were ineffective for treating iron-deficiency anemia , but that the ads implied that fatigue symptoms usually stem from iron deficiency . In most cases they do not , FTC stated . As an example , although an extreme one , of the effects of large doses over long periods , Taylor and Pye noted that the South Af-  | rican Bantus brew their Kaffir beer and cook their food in iron pots and may ingest from 100-200 milligrams daily ? far in excess of amounts the body can excrete . The iron gradually accumulates in the tissues of the liver , spleen , and pancreas , and eventually in the heart muscle . The excess " precipitates cirrhosis of the liver , diabetes , and heart damage . " 66 While there are dangers in too much iron , the burden of evidence is that some Americans get too little . That is why the FDA proposed in 1972 that the amount of iron in white bread and flour be doubled from , in the case of bread , the present maximum of 12.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proposal was opposed by some hematologists and other physicians , especially Dr. William Crosby , Chief of Hematology at Tufts University . But most hematologists , doctors , and nutritionists supported the proposal , as did the AMA . Not surprisingly in an era of much nutritional neuroticism , some people who had read articles against adding iron , wrote angry letters to FDA with such comments as , " Who do you think you are , God ? " Dr. Crosby argued that adding iron to help women may harm men . But even for a big bread eater such as a teen-age boy , the added iron would be only the equivalent of that in an ounce of cooked hamburger , Donald Miller , FDA nutritionist , told me . Iron from bread has an absorption rate of only 5 percent com-pared ? to about 20 percent for that from meat . Women typically need 18 milligrams a day but have been getting only about 6 per 1,000 calories , or about 12 a day from a 2,000 calorie diet . Miller estimated that 40 percent of menstruating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average intake for males would still be in the low 20 's . Miller advised that even a high intake of 50 milligrams a day could be easily tolerated by a normal man . And as a matter of fact , there is more iron-deficiency among men , too , than was earlier realized . The expected implementation in 1973 of the FDA proposal should help reassure people that it is not necessary to buy additional iron pills unless advised by a doctor . A deficiency of folacin or folic acid also can cause anemia , especially among pregnant women and heavy drinkers . But the problem can be solved more economically by correct cooking methods than by vitamin supplements . Folic acid is available in  | many foods , including meats , green vegetables , whole grains , citrus fruits , and nuts . However , prolonged cooking in water can destroy folic acid . Anemias due to lack of iron do not respond to folic acid treatment , Taylor and Pye point out.67 A lack of vitamin B12 as in a vegetarian diet also can cause anemia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tendency toward pernicious anemia also can be inherited . These are additional reasons why self-medication to correct self-diagnosed anemia or " tiredness " is foolhardy without consulting a doctor . Even if you do need iron , medical supervision is still necessary . Not all iron preparations are equally effective , FDA advisory committees reported in 1972 . ( Among those reported effective were Fergon , Difuron , Ferrolip Tablets , and Ferrous Fumarate . Some others were rated effective with qualifications. ) figure  | Trace minerals or microelements such as chromium , cobalt , manganese , molybdenum , and zinc also are essential in diets . The public is asking questions especially about chromium and zinc , Ruth Leverton reported at the 1971 National Nutritional Conference in Washington . She advised : Chromium has recently joined the family of essential nutrients . It has been shown to be needed for normal glucose metabolism and may act in tandem with insulin . There is fragmentary evidence that marginal chromium states may exist related to old age , pregnancy , and protein-calorie malnutrition . It is too soon to establish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplementation ( emphasis added ) . The availability of chromium in different foods varies greatly but in general animal proteins ( except fish ) and whole grain cereals are good sources of available chromium . Zinc has been recognized as an essential nutrient for some time . . . . Its availability from different foods varies . No recommended amounts of animal protein seem to supply dietary needs of zinc . It is important to note , however , that Dr. Leverton specifically advised that people need not be concerned about getting enough of the trace minerals , including chromium and zinc , if they are eating " a variety of foods . " Magnesium also has come in for particular discussion , and has been recommended by two nutritionists often on opposing sides : Adelle Davis and Dr. Frederick J. Stare , Harvard nutritionist who frequently is attacked by health foodists and others for his steady defense of sugar . Ms. Davis has said that magnesium " is absolutely essential to keep blood cholesterol down to prevent heart attacks . " Dr. Stare cited a study by medical teams from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cardiac health of brothers who had emigrated to America and those who had remained in Ireland . The main finding , delightedly publicized by the American Dairy Association , was that even though the stay-at-homes ate more saturated fats than their American siblings , their cholesterol levels were lower and their hearts better.68 Their greater physical activity burned up the additional cholesterol , according to Dr. Stare . But there were other factors : the Irish diet contained 50 to 100 percent more magnesium ? from greater usage of brown bread , whole grain cereals , and potatoes .  | Laboratory animals whose diets are low in magnesium tend to form calcium deposits in their soft tissue , and arteries are soft tissue . Dr. Stare also pointed out that the Irish drink tea , which contains fluoride ? another element which minimizes calcium deposits in the arteries . Here , too , it should be noted that ( 1 ) many ordinary foods provide the various microelements , and ( 2 ) all the trace elements " are known to cause injury at high levels of intake emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements , " as noted in the Recommended Dietary Allowances developed by the National Academy of Sciences . For example , tests on laboratory animals at Calcutta University , India , found that while zinc , copper , cobalt , and manganese are essential for good health and low amounts stimulated ascorbic acid metabolism , higher-than-normal levels decreased ascorbic acid content and lowered enzyme activity . Also , excessive intake of one trace element or vitamin may create problems with utilization of others . Thus , excessive molybdenum has been found in laboratory tests to interfere with utilization of copper . Vitamin A in large quantities appears to be an antagonist of vitamin K , causing hemorrhages in rats , the Food Protection Committee of the National Academy of Sciences reported in Toxicants Occurring Naturally in Foods . This condition can be prevented by taking additional vitamin K. So you are now on a merry-go-round of balancing one possibly excessive supplement by taking another . Similarly , the highly unsaturated fish oils such as cod liver oil are destructive of vitamin E. If you use a lot of polyunsaturated fats you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Financial Miracle Worker Vitamin E , as noted in chapter 2 , has become the big moneymaker for vitamin manufacturers , and the big dilemma for people who want to stay healthy . As the sales representative for one of the largest health food and vitamin conglomerates told me : Vitamin E is the rage vitamin . One book extols it for virility . The other book recommends it for heart conditions . Both have been questioned . But the fact that books have been written on this vitamin is enough to cause a run on it .  | The " run " has , in fact , more than doubled vitamin E sales in five years . Vitamin manufacturers themselves do not claim that vitamin E or other products containing it are necessary to treat or prevent any identifiable nutritional deficiency . If they did , they might be liable for legal action . In years past , FDA took action against vitamin E products promoted for treating sterility , heart disease , and muscular dystrophy . FDA said the vitamin is of no value for such purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin E will cure diabetes , leg cramps , aching feet , impotence , and also heal burns and wounds . Most of these claims have been disputed as based on uncontrolled trials or on extrapolation of studies on animals . But when you walk into a health food store you are likely to be confronted by literature announcing , " Vitamin E ? The Miracle Worker , " or even more dramatically , " Doctor says vitamin E prevents heart attacks . . . . Every year more than a million people die of heart disease in the U.S. alone ? and coronary thrombosis is the main culprit . . . . Can anything be done to stop this stupid slaughter ? Yes ! There is one simple substance that can completely wipe out the scourge of coronary thrombosis ! And that substance is vitamin E ! " How can such sweeping claims be made ? Usually they are made in what purports to be a reprint of an article ( from where , is not stated ) . To understand the connection between the current outpouring of health food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need to understand that while the government can seize products advertised or labeled with false or unverified claims , the right to publish these claims is protected by the Constitution . In some instances , when books making unproved or disputed medical claims were sold with the products , as in the case of the book Calories Do n't Count sold with safflower capsules , the government contended that the book was in the nature of a label , and did seize the books and capsules . Among several other cases of this type , FDA also seized stocks of honey sold in a Detroit store with an article reprint entitled Eat Honey and Increase Your Vitality . A whole publishing industry has grown up around health food  | and vitamin claims , and the health food stores and vitamin manufacturers can point to these books as the source of therapeutic promises without any need to commit themselves to any claims . As one revealing example , researcher Ruth Stoecker wrote to Radiance Products Company as an ordinary consumer asking about the usefulness of vitamin E. This large manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special ones for children , answered : We have no specific literature on vitamin E , but we feel you can obtain a good deal of information on this subject from the periodicals and books found in your health food store . Also , Dr. Wilfrid E. Shute , M.D. , has written several books on this subject and is wellknown for his studies on vitamin E. I might also suggest books written by Adelle Davis . You can see how it works . The company mentioned no literature doubtful of the value of vitamin E as a supplement by people in normal health . The Dr. Shute whose writings are the basis for the claims in leaflets found in health food stores , is a Canadian cardiac specialist and author of Vitamin E for Ailing and Healthy Hearts . His main thesis is that modern milling methods have robbed us of the vitamin E in the wheat germ removed to produce white flour , and that one form of vitamin E called alpha tocopherol or atocopherol especially has the ability to dissolve blood clots and keep them from forming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Originally vitamin E was proclaimed to be the fertility vitamin , in fact , tocopherol means " promoter of childbirth . " So , before much more was learned about it , vitamin E fell into the same disreputable class of phony aphrodisiacs and rejuvenators as Voronoff 's monkey glands , Moneys worth observed.69 Vitamin E sometimes still is sold with such claims , either openly or insinuated . But the lack of documentation of this effect in humans , and of most other claims , has made the claimed heart benefit currently the main issue . Adelle Davis is one of the most enthusiastic proponents of vitamin E not only for heart care but for many other illnesses including muscular dystrophy , fertility , pregnancy difficulties , burns , diabetes , varicose veins , bee stings , phlebitis , and cancer prevention . Her description of how vitamin E works to protect  | body cells is thorough and lucid . But her conclusions that vitamin E has " near-miracle " power ( her words for one reported recovery ) to cure or prevent some of the many medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences of her own or of one or another unnamed doctor . In a 1972 speech , although she denied any claim that vitamins will cure cancer , Ms. Davis publically stated that vitamin E " has been shown to help prevent cancer , " Helen Wilber reported in the Providence Evening Bulletin . Perhaps one of the most objective summaries of the verified findings so far was made by Barbara Premo , a spokesman ( or spokesperson ) for the New York City Health Department 's Bureau of Nutrition : We do know that vitamin E is essential to man . In 1968 , the National Research Council set a Recommended Dietary Allowance of 25 to 30 units of vitamin E for adults . It is also generally agreed that the needs for vitamin E are related to the amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet and in tissues . Studies indicate that as the intake of polyunsaturated fat rises , so should the intake of vitamin E. Fortunately , the polyunsaturated vegetable oils we use such as soybean , cottonseed , and wheat germ are also among our best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reassess vitamin E 's potential role in preventing and treating various forms of heart disease . Many have wisely chosen not to report their results until conclusive data have been collected . Evidence published to date does not support the extravagant claims that massive doses of vitamin E will cure muscular dystrophy , prevent heart disease , or accomplish many other alleged cures . At a conference sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences , F. C. Jager , a Netherlands researcher , reported that dietary linoleic acid of up to 7 percent of calories did not increase the vitamin E requirement in laboratory animals . But linoleic acid intakes over 20 percent of calories , " did cause an increased vitamin E requirement of 50 percent in rats and of 100 percent in ducklings. " 70 If your intake of polyunsaturated fats is not unusual , your vitamin E needs should be met by the amounts provided by a reasonably balanced diet . Two British researchers , Losowsky and Kelleher , found that while the intake of tocopherol ( vitamin E ) is very marginal in some Britons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably were above the accepted lower limit . They also found that subjects with a low intake of vitamin E appeared to require less , because of concomitant low intake of polyunsaturated fats . This may explain why they did not show signs of deficiency . " Interestingly , the British researchers also found that the percentages of a-tocopherol actually absorbed by the body progressively fell as the size of the dose increased . The recommended daily allowance for vitamin E , as developed by the Food and Nutrition Board , ranges from 5 I.U. for infants to 30 for adult males and pregnant and lactating women . But vitamin E preparations on the market range from 30 I.U. to as much as 1,000 , and most often , 100 to 400 . This is three to twelve times the normal recognized need . As another example of overload , General Mills adds additional vitamin E to wheat germ and sells it as X-TRA-E Wheat Germ even though wheat germ already is a rich source . Some manufacturers also have added vitamin E to multivitamin preparations in amounts ranging from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily dose , " The Medical Letter noted in a critical report of vitamin E promotions.72 In evaluating one manufacturer 's capsules containing mixed tocopherols , an FDA advisory panel in 1972 observed that the recommended dose probably represented an excessive supplement for an individual , and pointed out that the label did not even state what the supplement should be used for . The company responded that it was preparing a new label to " cover the drug for vitamin E deficiency . " In turn the panel tartly commented , " Obviously vitamin E will cure and prevent vitamin E deficiency . Undeniably there would be only a rare need but it may exist . " ( The panel also commented that it disagreed with three of the references cited by the manufacturer since " there is no evidence that vitamin E is helpful in any muscular disorders of man or in treating menopausal symptoms . " ) Vitamin E is widely found in ordinary foods , including vegetables ( especially those high in linoleic acid ) ; oils , butter , margarine ; whole grains ; wheat germ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leafy vegetables , Taylor and Pye point out.73 For those who may use extra amounts of polyunsaturated fats , one researcher noted at the New York conference on vitamin E  | that a critical ratio is 0.6 milligrams for each gram of polyunsaturated fatty acids.74 The literature on vitamin E also usually indicates that supplements may be needed in certain types of anemia occurring in small premature babies , and in cases of fat malabsorption in both children and adults . At least one scientist has suggested that vitamin E may have other nutritional significance , beyond its antioxidant effect , requiring further investigation.75 Pauling , too , has said that there is " some evidence ( not completely convincing at the present time but certainly suggestive ) " that increased intake of vitamin E may be effective for preventing heart disease.76 To further give vitamin E all possible due , a team of researchers reported that vitamin E supplements doubled the survival time of rats exposed to smogassociated pollutants . The researchers attributed the protective action to vitamin E 's antioxidant effect since oxidation of unsaturated fats otherwise would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her late husband isolated vitamin E , also thinks that it may protect against manifestations of aging such as brown pigment spots . Many of the writers associated with health foods seem to take advantage of the lack of definite knowledge to make sweeping claims for vitamin E , or come to firm conclusions on the basis of mere impressions , even when contrary evidence becomes known . A revealing exchange was reported at the Washington , D.C. , conference between Adelle Davis and a number of nutritionists . Dr. Arnold Schaefer of the Pan American Health Organization questioned her about the value of vitamin E in dissolving blood clots . According to the Washington Star , she replied : " I 'm not saying it always dissolves blood clots . But there is no proof that it doesn't. " 78 As an example of extrapolated conclusions , Rodale 's Prevention magazine published an article titled , " How Vitamin E Can Help Your Feet . " It reported that two researchers had found most older people had foot problems , including a poor circulation condition called arterial insufficiency . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your best friend " in problems involving peripheral circulation , a conclusion based mainly on Dr. Shute 's writings . We asked one of the authors of the original report , Robert B.  | Rakow , attending podiatrist at Maimonides Hospital of Brooklyn , whether he agreed with the recommendation added by Rodale that foot problems involving peripheral circulation can be alleviated by taking vitamin E. Rakow pointed out that the original report prepared by him and Dr. Sandor A. Friedman , Chief of the Chronic Disease Unit , mentioned no therapeutic aid . Furthermore , he said he did not agree that vitamin E would alleviate the problem . A St. Louis University medical professor , Dr. Robert E. Olson , did say at 1972 meetings of the American Heart Association that a cardiovascular illness ( emphasis supplied ) known as intermittent claudication , in which the circulation of leg arteries is impaired making walking difficult , has been found to benefit from large doses of vitamin E. In fact , he said it was the only type of illness that has been found to be helped by vitamin E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are featured in health food stores , says in Get Well Naturally that she " personally " takes " several hundred units of a vitamin E supplement each day " for " heart protection . " But no one can scold her for giving medical advice even though she is not a physician . She does n't say you should . In fact , in her preface she carefully disavows " responsibility for the remedies " she tells about ; she is " merely passing on what others have learned . " Rodale editor Jane Kinderlehrer also makes sweeping claims for vitamin E. She writes that it is " absolutely essential for smooth functioning of all reproductive processes , for heart and muscle health , and is a superb preventative of internal blood clots. " 79 ( Rodale editor Harold Taub collaborated with Dr. Shute in writing his book about vitamin E. ) While the panacea claims seem exaggerated , certainly there is justification for further research on vitamin E , and much is going on . A. L. Tappel of the University of California , one of the most active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antioxidant hypothesis , has said that further knowledge of the interactions of biological antioxidants and how they affect dietary requirements is needed . He , too , believes that air pollution may increase the need for vitamin E to protect body tissue . But he does not think large amounts are required . He has advised keeping up to the RDA ( 30 I.U. a day for an adult male ) but also has  | said that this much is sufficient.8 ? Any excess over ordinary needs is soon excreted . Vitamin C : Rage 2 Like vitamin E , the real boom in use of vitamin C was caused by a book ? in this instance , Linus Pauling 's Vitamin C and the Common Cold , which claims that massive doses of vitamin C can ward off or cure colds . Vitamin C , of course , has long been used in moderate potencies in an effort to help relieve colds , and sometimes to try to cure other infections . The 100-milligram tablets were the most popular and the doctor usually recommended citrus juices . But Pauling advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3,000 to 5,000 to cure them . The result is that the 250-milligram and even 500-milligram tablets have become widely sold . Pauling , a Nobel prize-winning chemist , can never be taken lightly . While he is not a physician neither is he a knee-reflex food faddist and has not , for example , been taken in by the health food industry 's claims for raw sugar , brown sugar , unrefined sugar , and honey . ( He has warned that such products have only minor nutritional advantages over white sugar , and that their sucrose , fructose , and glucose can have equally harmful heart effects . ) But in the case of vitamin C , many nutritional and medical authorities , including Charles G. King , the chief discoverer of vitamin C , feel Pauling did not substantiate his claims . One of the firmest rebuttals to Pauling 's recommendations came from Dr. William A. McColl , head of Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound . Dr. McColl is a long-time consumer advocate and pioneer in health-maintenance medical groups , and can hardly be considered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound co-op has many patients who are following Pauling 's advice and are still getting colds . He pointed out that Pauling accused the medical profession of refusing to adopt a cold remedy because it would lose them patients . But Group Health , which charges its members an annual fee for all care whether they get sick or not , does not have that financial interest in treating colds ; in fact , quite the opposite . McColl commented in the Midwinter , 1972 , issue of the co-op 's magazine , View , " I feel that taking two or three times as much of a vitamin as the body uses makes as much sense as putting five , ten , fifteen times  | as much gas in your tank as your car will hold . It simply runs out . " The warnings of King and others against possible risks such as kidney stones , severe diarrhea , harm to diabetics , and other known and unknown potential problems from excessive intake , were noted earlier in this chapter . While Pauling 's recommendations were widely criticized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and individual experiences , nevertheless sales of vitamin C in many areas doubled and tripled and some suppliers ran out of stock altogether after his book came out in 1970 . A controlled but limited experiment by three doctors at the University of Maryland found that giving eleven of the subjects 3,000 milligrams a day had no more effect on relieving colds than the placebos given to the other ten . ( Pauling rebutted that the dose of cold virus given to the subjects was " likely " to have been very large compared with ordinary exposure.81 ) One of the sources of Pauling 's recommendations was a study . by Drs . Diehl , Cowan , and Baker which observed a 15 percent decrease in incidence of colds among 360 University of Minnesota students who were given 200 milligrams a day compared to those given a placebo . Pauling considered this result more significant than did the three doctors who felt there might be a slight advantage but also said " one may well question its practical importance . " 82 Two researchers at a Scottish University late in 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-seven people , and a placebo on forty-three . Those who got the vitamin C were said to have had almost 50 percent fewer colds than the control group . The researchers felt that these results supported Pauling 's recommendations . The question of the effect of megadoses of vitamin C on viral colds is not fully resolved , and is difficult to resolve because of the great variety of viruses involved and the problem of constructing large-scale experiments in which the subjects must be given colds . By 1973 , of five tests of varying doses on varying numbers of subjects , in the U.S. , Canada and Europe , two were interpreted as in favor and three against the thesis that vitamin C is useful therapy for colds , Dr. R. M. Preshaw of the University of Toronto reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal . Accord-  | ing to the Medical Tribune , a double blind test ( not even the doctors know what they are giving ) at the University of Toronto did find that 26 percent of the 407 volunteers taking 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 411 on placebo . Some research has indicated that vitamin C is utilized more readily if taken with food in moderate amounts at a time.83 Other potential benefits or claims for benefits from abundant if not massive intake have been reported . Seelig cited studies which also indicated that vitamin C enhances iron absorption and calcium retention . Large doses are said to promote healing of wounds . Studies of rats demonstrated that calcium and ascorbic acid effect quicker healing of fractures.84 Dr. Williams suggested that vitamin C " may " delay old age because , like vitamin E , it has strong antioxidant properties , and because it builds healthy collagen and alters the blood composition in such a way as to help to decrease atherosclerosis . But , he complains , crucial experiments to determine the effect of different levels of vitamin C on aging have never been performed.85 Thus , this , like several other hypotheses of special benefits from vitamin C , remains unverified . There is no doubt of the critical importance of getting at least an " adequate " supply of vitamin C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking in American diets along with calcium and iron . While calcium deficiencies were frequent in high- as well as moderate-income families , the vitamin C lack was most noticeable in lower-income brackets . An orange or a glass of orange or grapefruit juice supplies what is ordinarily considered to be a day 's vitamin C need . Less rich but still good sources are kale , collards , cantaloupe , strawberries , raw cabbage , salad greens , and if cooked briefly in very little water ? cabbage , broccoli , and greens . A daily requirement , as shown in Appendix C , is considered to be 60 milligrams . However , it is noteworthy that King and others have suggested 100 to 200 milligrams " for optimum health . " 86 People who eat a great deal of protein also may need more vitamin C. When casein intake of laboratory animals was increased to 60 percent , ascorbic acid concentrations decreased , tests found . "  | As far as the issue of cancer prevention is concerned , there have been claims both ways , including at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumors in mice.88 Bioflavonoids are a related product energetically promoted by the health food industry . These compounds occur in the pulp and white membrane of citrus fruits . Roger J. Williams cited studies , mostly of the in vitro or laboratory type , showing that the flavonoids themselves exert " some protective effect against thrombosis and atherosclerosis . " 89 Adelle Davis , who would also have been a great success in the insurance business , advises her followers that " until more is known , it would seem wise to include bioflavonoids in the diet . " She cited experiments indicating that these substances , by making vitamin C more effective , increased the strength of capillary walls and decreased the seepage of blood and proteins . But she also noted that some investigators believe some unidentified nutrient associated with the bioflavonoids may be responsible for this improvement.90 Some other nutritional authorities consider the claims for bioflavonoids to be exaggerated . Eleanor Williams noted at the New York City hearings that these compounds were first described in 1936 as aiding in the decrease of capillary bleeding . She emphasized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bioflavonoids , either in animals or in man : " Claims that bioflavonoids are helpful in cases of hemorrhaging , or in such diseases as rheumatic fever , rheumatoid arthritis , arteriosclerosis , etc. , have not been proved by sound , controlled studies . If the bioflavonoids have any value to the body we do not know what it is . The bioflavonoids are consumed whenever you eat raw citrus fruits , and my advice is to get them that way , and not from expensive tablets sold in health food stores . " Vitamin manufacturers usually are careful not to make special health claims for bioflavonoids . When they do , they collide with the FDA . Thus , in 1971 , The Dwarfies Corp . of St. Joseph , Missouri , had a shipment of " thirteen vitamins with lemon bioflavonoids " seized on charges of " false and misleading labeling " suggesting that lemon bioflavonoids are nutrients with special dietary properties . But if the natural-vitamin sellers make no therapeutic claims , the certainly advertise bioflavonoids prominently with such  | carefully worded lines as , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food supplement , " or " Widely publicized in the press and prescribed by many physicians . " While some formulations provide a moderate 25 to 100 milligrams , others are packed with as much as 1,000 milligrams , with correspondingly potent prices . Thus , 100-milligram natural vitamin C tablets , which can cost as little as $1.50 or less with little or no bioflavonoid content , are sold for as much as $5.00 with large additions of bioflavonoids . The FDA itself would like to ban altogether any nutritional claims for rutin and other bioflavonoids , and early in 1973 made a proposal to that effect . Do You Need A Daily Multivitamin ? While E and C are the rage vitamins , and vitamin A also is popular , the main drive of the vitamin industry year in and year out is to get people to use a daily multivitamin . Many anxietyprovoking tactics are used , especially , ( 1 ) constant insinuations of deficiencies in ordinary foods because of soil impoverishment and ( 2 ) the threat that you may be suffering from a " subclinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " deficiency is supposed to be a condition in which it is not possible to actually detect a vitamin deficiency but one is suspected because of a tired feeling or undiagnosed aches and pains . In that case , according to the vitamin sellers , you should take a vitamin supplement to make sure . Some health foodists claim that " subclinical vitamin deficiencies are widespread and dangerous to health . " As one Long Island woman said , " By the time growers are through spraying , dusting , and forcing fruits and vegetables to ripen off the vines , there is very little of any vitamin left . " While spraying and dusting may pose other problems , obviously they have nothing to do with vitamin content . Obviously , too , fatigue , aches , and pains may arise from many causes other than nutritional deficiencies , including a number of illnesses , insufficient rest , and even emotional stress . The health food industry is aware itself of the contradiction in promoting organic and natural foods that are supposed to be healthier or more nutritious than commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vitamins . Thus , Mother Na  | ture 's Nutrition Centers coyly explains : " Would that all this natural food were enough . Nutritional scientists tell us that for many of us there 's a need to supplement even the most natural foods . " Other sellers are even more relentless . The U.S. Health Club , Inc. , which sells Naturella vitamins , points to smog , pesticides , detergents polluting our water and rivers , and man 's chemicalized environment " threatening to destroy the ecology , " and warns that " the human body has an ecology of its own that 's worth protecting with good natural foods and good natural vitamins . " " Nutritional insurance " is a key sales message that vitamin manufacturers constantly hammer at an already worried public . Wm . T. Thompson Co. even headlines its ads " Insurance Policy " and says it is " difficult " to maintain a balanced diet on a day-today basis . Besides people who tend to be nutritionally neurotic or overanxious , two special targets of vitamin sellers , are children and older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early 1970 's over high-pressure advertising for children 's vitamins on Saturday-morning television ? prime viewing time for children . A Boston parents ' organization , called Action for Children 's Television , filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission about the outpouring of ads for candy-coated vitamins with no warnings against overconsumption . A special concern of doctors who complained about the promotion of vitamin pills directly to children has been their iron content . A four-year-old boy in Kansas City , Kansas , one day swallowed forty candy-covered multivitamin pills shaped like tiny fish , owls , etc. , in different colors . He became seriously sick , of both vitamin A and iron poisoning , and had to spend two days in intensive care , Norman Mark reported in Today 's Health . The little boy said he ate the pills because Captain Kangaroo told him vitamins would make him big and strong , and he wanted to grow big and strong fast . The network that presents " Captain Kangaroo " denied that Captain Kangaroo ever said these words , but the child believed he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisoning each year , 3,200 involve children under five . Advertisers fail to warn parents of the danger of such medication , Dr. Jay Arena , director of the Duke University Poison Con-  | trol Center , pointed out . Dr. Frederick Lovejoy of the Boston Poison Information Center , warned that vitamins combined with iron may be especially dangerous since a large intake of iron can cause diarrhea , blood in the stools , vomiting and , if enough has been taken , possibly shock and coma . Since 1,000 milligrams of ferrous sulfate may cause symptoms in a two- to three-year-old , and since vitamin preparations with iron contain 40 milligrams , twenty-five tablets or fifteen cc. of liquid preparations could be harmful . Aside from such toxic risks , teaching children to rely on vitamin pills for adequate nutrition itself is poor nutritional education . A number of medical authorities , including Drs . Arena and Lovejoy , have said that children who eat a balanced diet have no need for vitamin supplements after the first year or two of life . If there is no genuine nutritional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or accelerate growth . In any case , the decision to take vitamin pills should be made by parents and a doctor , not by the child . As a result of the outcry , in 1972 three large vitamin manufacturers agreed to stop their commercials directed at children . However , this by no means assures that children are no longer a target for vitamin promotion . Parents are still the target , and sometimes they do n't know much more than the children . Radiance Products Co. , for example , has developed natural vitamins for children . Instead of being sweetened with ordinary sugar and chocolate , these vitamins are " naturally sweetened " with date sugar , honey , fructose , and lactose . The lure is , " Bring your children in for samples so they can see for themselves how things that are good for them can also taste good . " But as we have seen in other products , there is no advantage in such natural sweetening , and the potential enticement to overconsumption of these candylike vitamins is no less . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are relentless . One pediatrician , Dr. George G. Graham , who helped develop a candy-type vitamin pill for Miles Laboratories ( makers of One-A-Day ) told a Senate committee that the goal of making school lunch a vehicle for nutritional education using traditional foods is " an impossible dream . " He deprecated the hope of community nutritionists that the problem of nutri-  | tional education can be solved by going back to " the good old days of natural foods , bought fresh , carefully prepared and served with careful attention to the basic food groups . " 92 A Miles Laboratories vice-president showed the senators chewable tablets in five flavors that could be fed to children at the cost of a penny a day and would provide the RDA for twelve micronutrients and one-fourth of the RDA for calcium . ( Let alone the obvious self-seeking effort to discourage genuine nutritional education based on balanced , attractive meals , it is significant that parents are charged three or four times more than " a penny a day " for children 's multivitamins bought in stores . ) Older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , surveys by USDA nutritionists sometimes have found oldsters spending as much on vitamins as they would have to pay for well-balanced meals . From time to time FDA has seized vitamin products with added protein , safflower oil , dried yeast and liver , which are sold with literature falsely claiming that nutritional requirements of people over forty are different from adults generally . Other false assertions have been made for geriatric supplements , including their use as a treatment and prevention for degenerative , cardiovascular , and rheumatic diseases ; diabetes ; and diminished sexual ability . A persistent promotion directed to older people is the so-called " negative option " plan . This plan obligates consumers who sign up to pay for monthly shipments of vitamins unless they notify the company not to send them . One large seller , the Golden Fifty Pharmaceutical Co. of Chicago , was the subject of complaints from both the Federal Trade Commission and the Illinois Attorney General who charged that people who responded to a free offer were enrolled without their knowledge in a negative option plan . In any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy of Sciences-National Research Council in 1972 gave only partial confirmation to claims made for most of the twentytwo vitamin or vitamin-mineral preparations it had surveyed . Most significantly , the committee stated that it did not recognize " the need for vitamin supplements for healthy individuals eating an adequate diet , " and there was no precise data on which " rational formulation " of such supplements can be based .  | The committee did say it recognized the need for supplementation with single-vitamin preparations in some people . But any large or long-term medication of that kind , should , of course , be supervised by a doctor . Without doubt many people are confused about the usefulness of vitamin supplements . In a survey made for FDA , National Analysts , Inc. , found that most Americans hold at least one " inflated idea " of the benefits of such supplements . The most common misconception is that extra vitamins will provide more energy , and that people who feel tired and run down probably need more vitamins and minerals 93 But at the same time , large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foods will supply all the nutrition needed . This inconsistency seems to indicate that many of those questioned do not believe that most people normally eat balanced meals . The study of health beliefs had been initiated at the suggestion of the Senate Committee on Aging following hearings dealing with misrepresentations made to elderly consumers . But the investigation found that older people were less likely than middleaged people to expect vitamins and other food supplements to give them pep and energy , or to prevent colds . Women and lesseducated and lower-income people were more likely to expect such benefits.94 In general , the investigators felt , the huge consumption of vitamin and other supplements has become a " mass placebo . " Some nutritional experts feel that supplements may be useful for people who have random eating habits . Teen-agers and older people sometimes are cited as such faulty eaters . People experiencing temporary physiological stress or those unwilling to eat because of allergy , illness , or emotional upset may also be candidates for supplements . Since excesses of vitamins A and D and folacin can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing the B complex and C vitamins is safe and " may provide the extra protection that some individuals may really need . " 95 Facts and Fads in B Vitamins Some past surveys have found that sometimes diets are short of B vitamins . One reason may be that they are soluble in water and  | may be lost in cooking . Another possible reason is that some women skimp on protein a common source of B vitamins and necessary in adequate supply at every meal for repair of body tissue and to help the system utilize nutrients in other foods . But the occasional shortage by no means justifies the hard sell of B complex preparations and other supplements . " One of the natural nutritional wonders of the world . " " B complex and mineral values are stupendous . " " One of nature 's richest foods in B vitamins . " These are some of the promotional claims by sellers for brewer 's yeast . Undeniably brewer 's yeast and wheat germ are worthwhile supplements to any diet , if not actually wonder foods . Brewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; wheat germ has B vitamins and is also high in protein . But the logic of the situation is that ordinary protein foods , whole grains , and enriched cereals are well stocked with B vitamins , even if not to the extent of brewer 's yeast , and it is simpler and less expensive to get what you need this way than from the yeast at $1.75 a pound . There also is the question of how much your body needs ; in fact , how much it can absorb . As with the other water-soluble vitamins vitamin C and folic acid ? B vitamins do not accumulate in the body to any great extent and excess amounts are merely excreted , Marcella Katz points out.96 I f brewer 's yeast is available at reasonable prices it does provide a useful supplement to diets low in protein foods from animal sources . The B complex vitamins are thiamin ( B , ) ; riboflavin ( B2 ) ; niacin ( niacinamide ) ; pyridoxine ( B6 ) ; B12 ; folacin ( folic acid ) ; pantothenic acid ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nutrition and ordinary food sources is provided in appendix A. It is necessary to get some of the first three every day : thiamin , riboflavin , and niacin . If you eat foods providing these three , normally you will get the other B vitamins . As noted , the amounts of the other B vitamins needed usually are not large . While recommended allowances have not been established for all of them , the RDA for the much-promoted Biz is 1 to 2 micrograms for infants , 5 for adults , and 6 for the elderly . Many protein foods provide B , 2 in significant amounts ; for examplc , a cup of milk , a half cup of cottage cheese , three ounces of cheddar , or an egg , all provide about I microgram . Other sources  | are meat , fish , and shellfish . Yet vitamin sellers incessantly promote products containing B12 . Often there seems to be no particular rhyme or reason for the amount added . Some multivitamin products have merely 1 microgram ; others , as much as 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ micrograms ? fifty times the RDA . Even the Vitamin Information Bureau , the public relations arm of the vitamin industry , has said that people who eat protein-rich foods generally get enough B12 ; populations with low protein intake " probably harbor many individuals with a relative Biz deficiency but even in such groups clinical symptoms of the deficiency are rare except among strict vegetarians. " 97 Vitamin B6 , pyridoxine , also is often heavily promoted , and also with widely varying , no-rhyme-or-reason potencies . The recommended allowance is 2 milligrams a day for males . One study of the needs of women indicated that the dietary requirement for a young woman consuming a moderate protein diet is 1.5 milligrams.98 Yet some commercial combination products on the market provide as little as one-sixth of a milligram a day , while some individual B6 preparations provide as much as 50 milligrams " to help prevent isolated deficiencies . " The random nature of many formulations was demonstrated by the 1972 report of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council committee . It noted that a number of brands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparations did not make much medical sense . They had excessive amounts of some B vitamins for use as a dietary supplement but too little of others for the treatment of actual deficiencies.99 At least one reason for the less-than-rational variations is that the manufacturers put in large amounts of inexpensive ingredients such as vitamins A and C , and smaller amounts ( relative to standards of daily requirements ) of some of the costlier vitamins and minerals . Several widely sold preparations have as much as 40,000 units of vitamin A. Some of the shotgun preparations on the market have twenty-eight to thirty-seven ingredients even though such authorities as the FDA and American Medical Association have said that twelve to seventeen vitamins and minerals recognized as needed from outside sources are all that are needed in a supplement . ( Other writers have reported supplements on the market with as many as seventy-five ingredients. )  | Another effect of the variations in amount and number of ingredients is to make price comparisons extremely difficult for the already confused consumers . The whole point is that despite the blatant scare selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are rare in this country today . The health food literature insinuates rather than cites specific cases , as in this statement about B vitamins distributed in health food stores by the " American Health Education Foundation " : A shortage of one or more of any of these precious elements ( Bcomplex vitamins and minerals ) may cause serious physical and mental defects . That is why a vitamin-mineral all purpose multiple food supplement taken three times daily is indispensable for overall body vigor and mental health . The words " minimum daily requirement " ( MDR ) themselves have tended to mislead the vitamin-popping public . Sellers have played on these words to boast that the various vitamins in their capsules , tablets , or liquids provide , for example , twice the minimum requirements for vitamin D , five times the MDR for vitamin B1 , and so on . The implication seemed to be that more than the minimum was beneficial to health , the FDA itself complained in 1966 . ( That was some twenty-five years after the FDA had coined the ill-fated phrase and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The FDA first announced in 1962 that it would seek to regulate vitamin formulations and promotional tactics more closely . " It is virtually impossible for the consumer to make a rational choice based on the relative merits of these shotgun ' formulas , " Wallace F. Janssen , an FDA information officer , pointed out at the time . n 1966 , then Food and Drug Commissioner James L. Goddard proposed restrictions on multivitamin preparations to help both the public and doctors know more accurately what they are buying or recommending , whether the buyer really needs the product , and how to compare values more knowledgeably . To this end , Dr. Goddard proposed to ( 1 ) eliminate the words " minimum daily requirement " or at least the word " minimum , " ( 2 ) restrict vitamin supplements to eleven vitamins and six minerals , and ( 3 ) require labels to carry a statement to the effect that usually vitamins and minerals are supplied in abundant amounts by ordinary foods and except for people with particular medical  | needs there is no scientific basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a somewhat-diluted regulation was proposed and is pending at this writing . The proposal has been fought furiously not only by the natural vitamin sellers but by the older and much larger and influential commercial drug and vitamin manufacturers , and even by food manufacturers and canners . They , too , often add vitamins to their products and promote them on the basis of the " minimum daily requirements . " Unfortunately for consumers , the FDA proposal was also opposed by the Federation of Homemakers , a Virginia-based organization with obvious health-foodist and antifluoridation bias . Dr. Goddard explained , when he made his try , that the regulations would not bar the sale of vitamin products and other dietary supplements . But the vitamin manufacturers are running scared . For example , in 1972 , Plus Products , Inc. reported that if the FDA prevailed in enforcing its proposed new regulations , the company would be required to reformulate and relabel products comprising about 60 percent of its sales . The government , in fact , that year did bring a court action against this company asserting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegedly representing that some benefit would be derived from supplementing one 's diet with certain listed ingredients . The government claimed that either there was no need in human nutrition for these ingredients , or that need as a supplement had not been established . Natural vs . Synthetic Vitamins As well as persistently promoting the idea that virtually everybody needs to take vitamin supplements regularly , the health food industry insists that these must be " natural " vitamins supposedly from natural food sources . There are two fallacies : One is that natural vitamins are superior to those from synthetic sources . The other is that vitamin products sold as natural really do not contain any synthetic ingredients . The natural vitamin products usually are much the highest priced of those we surveyed , as shown in the price chart at the end of this chapter . Vitamin C " from Pure Rose Hips " may sell for $1.75 for a bottle of 100 tablets ( 100 milligrams ) . Some formula-  | tions of vitamin C combined with honey or other ungermane ingredients may be priced as high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C sells for as little as fifty cents per 100 in chain and department store sales . The big drive of the natural vitamin packagers is to take the vitamin business away from the brands such as One-A-Day which have always been excessively priced but have been the big sellers by virtue of heavy national advertising . One young manufacturer said " The natural vitamins are the vitamins of our generation . Theragran and One-A-Day belong to the older generation . " Many of the claims on behalf of the high-priced natural vitamins by users and sellers range from the emotional to the speculative . One man told me : My family has been taking the natural vitamins ( most of which one can make oneself ) for about fifteen years . The money we save in doctor bills more than pays for the vitamins many times over . Anybody in his right mind knows that the best is n't too good for one 's stomach the motor of everyone . The proprietor of a Long Island health food center asserted : People eating natural foods can get vitamins from food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the loss of complete nourishment in cooking , exposure to air , and all sorts of things . You have to read a lot and believe in the natural way of life . The vice-president of a large vitamin-packing company said : We do n't know that natural or organic vitamins have any advantage . But to say they do n't is as wrong as it is to say they do . Both Adelle Davis and Carleton Fredericks , perhaps the leading proponents of using lots of vitamins , have said that they use synthetic vitamins although they believe natural ones have added benefits . Fredericks said at the New York City hearings : " There is evidence that natural vitamins are clinically more beneficial although I take synthetic vitamins myself . " Adelle Davis told James Trager : " Most of the health food stores make a great to-do about natural vitamin C being superior , but they have no proof of that . It 's perfectly true that if you drink a glass of orange juice it 's better than a 100 milligram tablet of vitamin C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 00 In Let 's Eat Right to Keep Fit , she wrote : " ln general it seems  | wise to use natural sources whenever you can , but be willing to use synthetic ones whenever you need to . " Some of the health food writers try to make a case for natural vitamins on the basis , most often , of laboratory experiments . Beatrice Trum Hunter , author of Consumer Beware , cites several experimental reports and tests mainly on laboratory animals to support her thesis that there are " subtle but vital biological differences " between vitamins from natural and synthetic sources.101 An extensive effort by Rodale 's Prevention magazine to ' support the use of natural vitamins similarly relied largely on experimental reports and also made much of one doctor 's report of an allergic reaction by one patient to synthetic B vitamins . ' 02 Often in such one-sided defenses of the higher-priced natural vitamins , the writers cite reports comparing results from synthetic vitamins with those from whole natural foods . This is somewhat different from comparing synthetic vitamins with vitamins isolated from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional vitamins and nutrients , and presumably a more natural balance of them ( although Mother Nature often is as whimsical in the varying amounts she provides as are the natural vitamin manufacturers ) . In one such comparison , Prevention stated that minks " fed all known B vitamins in synthetic form . . . would eventually die but fed yeast , however , they stay healthy and beautifully furred on its natural B complex . " The magazine omitted the fact that the yeast is also very rich in protein ; iron , calcium , and other minerals ; and also provides other vitamins . The actual fact is , vitamin products sold as natural are often partly synthetic . Thus , one manufacturer said , in preparing vitamin B2 tablets of 5-milligram potency , 2 1 /2 milligrams or more might be synthetic and 2 1/2 or less might be from yeast . Similarly , a product that says Vitamin C " with rose hips " rather than " from rose hips " is really part synthetic ascorbic acid and part rose hip powder : A leading private-brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted to claim 100 percent of high potencies . Such tablets " would be too big to swallow . " As an example of the varying proportions of natural substances in natural vitamin products , Plus Products advertises in its catalog " Vitamin C Complex . . . with the entire vitamin C from  | imported rose hips , " but also offers on the same page , " Higher potency vitamin C with rose hips ( from ascorbic acid with rose hips added ) . " The percentage of rose hips is not indicated , although any sizable reduction in rose hip content would be more of an economic than nutritional loss , from all accounts . In processing tablets and capsules , vitamin manufacturers also must use synthetic excipients and binders , such as ethyl cellulose , Polysorbate 80 ( a synthetic emulsifier ) , as well as gum acacia or avaluc . Adolph Kamill , Berkeley co-op pharmacist , also found in a visit to two California manufacturers of natural vitamins that their so-called " Rose Hips Vitamin C Tablets " were really made from natural rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 percent . Similarly , their B vitamins consisted of synthetic chemicals added to yeast and other natural bases . The vitamin E products indeed were derived from natural sources mainly vegetable oils . But to concentrate the vitamin in a capsule , various chemicals must be used for extraction and separation , Kamill noted . Furthermore , the vegetable material is grown with the use of the usual insecticides and chemical fertilizers . Ironically , even the capsule must contain a preservative so it wo n't turn rancid . ' o3 Perhaps the most ironic incident occurred during the 1970-71 boom in vitamin C which followed the publication of Linus Pauling 's book on vitamin C and colds . FDA required the recall of millions of vitamin C pills because they contained sodium ascorbate , a substitute for ascorbic acid , which was not declared on the labels . The tablets actually had such evocative labels as Vitamin C Rose Hips Supplement , Acerola-Flavored Vitamin C , OrangeFlavored Vitamin C , Blueberry-Flavored Vitamin C , and so on . Not only were buyers not getting the prized acerola , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health hazard to people who needed to restrict their sodium intake . Revealingly , these pills were distributed mostly to health food stores to be resold under their own labels , showing that health food stores themselves do not always know what they are selling . The Pauling-inspired demand had created a shortage of ascorbic acid , so some vitamin manufacturers switched to the sodium salt of ascorbic acid , which has nearly the same vitamin C activity , the FDA said at the time .  | Health foodists distrust synthetic vitamins because some are manufactured from toxic products such as coal tars . But even Prevention has granted that : " Of course , the toxic substances do not remain in the purified product ? unless there 's some slip-up in chemical reactions and inspection . " ' " Orthodox medical authorities and nutritionists who emphasize that the molecular structure of a synthetic vitamin is exactly the same as that of the natural vitamin , stress that both perform the same biological activity . " The body can not tell the difference between a molecule of vitamin C in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C synthesized in the laboratories , " Hilda S. White observed . ' 05 In fact , at the New York City hearings , Charles G. King charged that it is " clearly misleading " to claim special values for a vitamin that has been isolated from rose hips , acerola cherries , or citrus , " as if there was some magic in their origin as an organic vitamin compared to a synthetic vitamin . " Linus Pauling too has said there is no difference between the natural and synthetic vitamins . Natural vitamin advocates also claim that the additional natural ingredients in such products are beneficial in themselves and provide a nutritional balance with the natural vitamin . While much of the validity of this belief may depend on the actual formulation and manufacturing method , the orthodox experts tend to consider any naturally associated vitamins and minerals usually to be nutritionally insignificant . Some of the highest prices and most sweeping claims for natural vitamins come from door-to-door salesmen . There have been a long line of such products sold door-to-door including Nutrilite and Nutri-Bio . Often they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a percentage of the sales price . A recent episode involving vitamin products sold by a multilevel organization resulted in the California State Attorney bringing suit against Bob Cummings , Inc. , a company headed by the movie and TV star who is also famous as a health food advocate . Cummings previously was connected with Nutri-Bio Corp . Its products were seized several times during the 1960 's for allegedly exaggerated claims by salesmen . The government complained that salesmen claimed the vitamin products could be used to prevent or treat a long list of illnesses from pyorrhea to diarrhea ,  | and , most dangerously , heart disease and cancer . The main thrust of the Attorney General 's complaint was that the Cummings company had lured investors into buying franchises by claims that they could earn up to $200,000 a year recruiting others to sell the vitamins . But one investor complained that he found himself unable to sell the vitamins because they were so high priced in comparison with similar products . figure  | BREAD VS . THE STUFF YOU EAT WHILE THE HARD SELL for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food industry , bread has become the banner of the consumer battalions that march in today 's food revolution . They complain that modern white bread is denuded of much of its nutrition ; that it is a plastic loaf loaded with additives to keep it soft ; that it is tasteless , even lifeless ; that rats fed it as their only food could not survive , perhaps did not want to survive ; that it lacks the vitamin E which maintained earlier generations without heart disease while they crossed plains and broke prairies . A bread cult has developed in some communes . A well-known Los Angeles commune is called Bread for Life . The Yoga Society sells its bread all over the country . Another bread is called Mannafood . The complaints , although sometimes exaggerated , have some justification . Apparently many people do not realize the difference in nutrients between white and whole grain breads . In 1972 when the Giant Food supermarkets in the Washington , U.C. , area labeled white and whole wheat breads with their respective nutrients , thus revealing that the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sales increased from 400 to 1,400 loaves a day , Gerson Barnett , the chain 's grocery vice-president , reported . The criticism of white bread and other products baked from white flour is one issue that finds orthodox nutritionists and I Di )  | health foodists in agreement . Their criticism is achieving some results . Some of the more nutritious grains such as buckwheat are enjoying a revival . State authorities are insisting on enrichment of specialty breads and other baked products as well as standard white bread . Federal authorities are currently increasing standards of enrichment the higher iron content discussed in chapter 7 is an example . There was a huge increase just from 1970 to 1971 in the voluntary use of enriched flours in commercially manufactured cookies and crackers sold in stores.106 There also is a trend to increase the protein and other nutrients in macaroni and similar products by adding soy flour and whole grains . Too , some families have taken to baking their own bread although this seems more a creative interest or a personal declaration of safe rebellion than an underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial production even of cookies and cakes . But more commercial bakers themselves are offering whole grain products . On the other hand , some of the criticisms are almost paranoiac . " White sugar and white flour are poisons to all people and especially to a certain segment , " a California woman told me in a comment not unusual among health foodists . In other instances , health bread bakers quite obviously exploit some of the unproven and even disproven fetishes of the health foodists , promoting such ingredients as honey , brown sugar , soybean oil , sprouted kernels , sea salt , and spring water , as well as such unproven items of health food folklore as stone-ground flour . The promoters also play on current fears with such lines as " no artificial preservatives " and " only ingredients that come from nature . " Nor are the special health breads really available to the poor who might benefit most from them . They often cost two to three times the typical 26 to 30 cents per pound of the much-criticized standard enriched white bread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the health breads often only provide still more protein and a few more vitamins for the relatively affluent whose diets are already sufficient in these nutrients . The growing interest in whole grains has produced a number of special whole grain products such as muffin mixes and even mixtures of ' flours from seven or eight whole grains , no less , as though such mixtures might pyramid their healthfulness . If one  | whole-grain is healthy , eight must be much better . The main criticism of white bread is that the milling process for white flour removes the outer covering , the bran , and the germ . The remainder , called the endosperm , is the portion which is ground into white flour . But it is the bran layer and germ that contain most of the essential vitamins and minerals in the whole grain . In " enriched bread , " some of the most important nutrients of the lost nutrients are restored . These are thiamin , riboflavin , niacin , and iron . The levels of enrichment of these three B vitamins and iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat actually is enriched depends on where you live and what type you buy . While the federal government sets the standards of enrichment , it is up to the states to require enrichment , and to specify the type . By 1972 , about thirty-five states did require enrichment of white bread although not necessarily specialty breads , such as French , Italian and rolls , or cakes and crackers . At 1972 enrichment levels ( before the new increase in iron became effective ) about four slices of enriched bread ( close to four ounces ) provided a young woman with all of her daily calcium needs ; about 15 percent of protein needs ; 24 percent of thiamin ; 19 percent of niacin ; and 13 percent of riboflavin and iron . Even in states that do not require enrichment of white bread , it usually is enriched voluntarily by commercial bakers . ( The label will say . ) But enrichment does not stop the argument . Four major nutrients are restored but not others . Enriched white bread usually has less calcium and less of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a little less protein . In terms of cost of nutrients , the standard white enriched bread is the best comparative value followed by standard whole wheat and rye breads . Because it is mass-produced and usually is the price leader of the large supermarkets and bakeries , enriched white bread provides nearly as much basic nutrition at a lower cost than the special health breads . As one example , eight ounces of one of the special whole grain breads made with natural ingredients provides one-third of a day 's adult protein needs or about 22 grams at an extra cost of about 12 cents for the eight ounces . Ordinary enriched white bread has about 20 grams of protein for  | eight ounces . So you pay 12 cents more for about two grams of protein plus a little more calcium , B vitamins , some vitamin E , and several other vitamins of small amount and sometimes even undetermined need . In terms of egg , cheese , hamburger , or other protein foods of even more complete quality than the protein in bread , two grams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economic value of about one and one-half to two cents . Another special bread , a " protein " bread marketed by a leading national chain , boasts on its label that it provides 50 percent more protein than the same chain 's standard enriched white bread . But when you figure out the relative cost per pound you see that you are paying 100 percent more for the special bread . Next to enriched white bread , the standard whole grain breads ? whole wheat and rye provide the most nourishment at the lowest cost . Questions of personal taste aside , whole wheat bread does provide about 20 percent more protein than enriched white and rye , more calcium and more of the B vitamins than does the typical rye bread made of one-third rye flour . ( For a comparison of nutrients in various types of bread , see appendix D. ) Why do millers remove useful nutrients to make white flour and then return some ? For one reason , the resultant white flour has or had prestige , although its earlier status now is apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical reason is that whole grains have a greater tendency to turn rancid , which is why such breads need refrigeration . Whole grains also are more likely to harbor insects and other contaminants than sifted white flour . One other advantage of white flour , cited by Dr. Leo Lutwak , a clinical nutritionist at Cornell University , is that the milling removes certain chemical substances such as phytates , which may interfere with utilization of some nutrients such as iron , calcium , and magnesium.107 Now that the logjam to additional enrichment of white bread has been broken by the 1972 requirement for additional iron , thiamin , and niacin , the nutritional quality of enriched white bread probably will be further improved . The addition of vitamin B , , ( pyrodoxine ) also has been suggested , since B6 is especially affected by processing ( white bread has only 15 percent of the Br6 in whole wheat ) . Additional calcium may he useful since this is one of the nutrients found to he relatively short in the diets of some  | Americans . Enriched white breads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent added nonfat milk . Those with 5 to 6 percent have much the same relatively high calcium of whole wheat bread and also have added protein ? all accomplished at small cost . USDA scientists have developed a way to increase the protein in white bread from the 1972 level of 8.7 percent to as much as 15 percent , by adding soy flour . The new process also triples the concentration of lysine , one of the essential amino acids . Certainly enrichment of bread is a more sensible and less costly approach to supplying additional nutrients than the proposals of Robert Choate to add more vitamins to expensive ready-to-eat sugared cereals or of Ralph Nader to add more vitamins to cakes , cookies , and soda pop . Where whole wheat and other whole grain bread is available at a moderate price ? for example , within 25 percent of the cost of enriched white bread it may make both economic and nutritional sense to use it . This is especially true for people who feel that their eating habits are haphazard and who otherwise may buy vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasible for economic or other reasons , you need not be frightened into thinking you are starving , like Roger J. Williams ' rats ( he fed them only enriched white bread until they died ) . Most people do not eat bread alone for any sustained period . The peanut butter , meats , fish , poultry , eggs , cheese , milk and other whole-protein foods usually eaten with bread supply additional B , E , and other vitamins and often calcium . Too , as noted , enriched white breads made with 5 to 6 percent nonfat milk powder have additional protein , calcium , and other nutrients . But the more dedicated health foodists are hardly satisfied even with commercial whole wheat bread , let alone enriched white with added nonfat milk . They object that these breads are still not made with organically grown grains ; they have additives ; the flour k not stone ground and often is bleached . It is true that many commercial ' breads and cakes are loaded with additives to maintain freshness , softness , and to enhance their flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated by the fact that there are competitive brands with fewer additives . If you read the labels , you do have some choice , as indicated in chapter 10 , between baked goods with  | many additives , even eye- and tongue-fooling artificial colorings and flavors , and those with few or even no synthetic or chemical additives . Thus , Consumer Action Now gave a " Good Earth Award " in 1971 to Chock Full O'Nuts for marketing additivefree cakes at a reasonable price . ( There also are other additivefree brands . ) CAN also recommended that consumers never trust a word that ends in " y " such as " buttery " or " chocolatey " nor the word " real " as in " real banana flavor. " 108 On the other hand , as noted in chapter 10 , some additives do have an economic and even health-protecting function , as in the case of calcium or sodium propionate and other mold inhibitors . Some molds are known to be toxic . Bread made without preservatives usually will get moldy in three or four days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetish of the health food movement with uncertain documentation.109 The sellers and users have two theories . One is that the stone mills are cooler ; that the heat generated by steel mills or rollers removes some of the nutritional properties of the grain . Another is that the stone mills crush and distribute the wheat germ more evenly into the flour , while the steel mills scrape the wheat germ from the grain . But even some of the bakers who use stone-ground flour in breads and other products are uncertain of the benefits . Stanley C. Roy , vice president of Elam 's , a mill producing stone-ground flour , wrote to Mrs. Stoecker ( who had inquired " as an ordinary consumer " ) : Provided that all of the wheat grain is ground into flour , I doubt that there is any difference in the nutritional value of stone-ground whole wheat flour vs. whole wheat flour that is ground some other way . Where methods other than stone grinding are used , I believe there is a stronger possibility that part of the grain is taken away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand that boasts on its label , " Stone Ground Flour . " But Gordon McGovern , President of Pepperidge Farm , explained : Stone grinding the flour is much slower than grinding it on highspeed roller mills and less heat is produced during the milling . This is alleged to result in a superior retention of the natural vitamins from the grain . However . . . there is very little data to support  | this claim although it is probably advantageous to use the cooler process . There is more certain documentation of vitamin loss from bleaching flour to make it whiter than white . McGovern believes that " there is no indication that the present bleaching agents have any adverse effect on the flour except for a small reduction in the vitamin E content , " which in any case is very low in white flour . But a continuing research project by the USDA , Purdue Research Foundation , and American Institute of Baking has found that only about 10 percent of vitamin E survived milling and bleaching in most types of wheat.10 Vitamin E was particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable shortening the vitamin E came mainly from the shortening . In general , bleaching caused greater loss of some nutrients than did the milling process itself . Unbleached flours and commercially baked breads made with unbleached flour are available in stores . Unfortunately , at present , the agents often used for bleaching also provide the aging function . As noted in Appendix B , freshly milled wheat flour lacks the qualities needed for an elastic , stable dough . Breads and cakes made with unbleached flour have less volume and more open grain , especially if the protein level of the flour is relatively low , as in all-purpose flour . High protein blends tend to compensate for the absence of maturing-bleaching agents . While whole grain products in general are desirable when not overpriced , sometimes cultists fool themselves . Thus , " A Natural Peasant Bread " sold with the slogan , " Back to the Good Earth for Your Daily Bread , " actually was made with bleached and bromated flour . Buyers would have to be well-to-do peasants indeed , since this bread cost almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the adjoining shelf . People who try to buy whole grains at farm feed stores to bypass high prices at health food stores court contamination . In fact , in 1972 Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Jon Wefald had to ask livestock and poultry feed dealers to put up signs warning that their feeds were intended for animal consumption only . Where are two risks . One , which may be more aesthetic than nutritional , is that the field-run grains used in livestock and  | poultry rations often have bugs , worms , " and parts thereof , " as Wefald put it . Much higher standards of cleanliness are required for human foods . Insects are high in protein but American consumers are loathe to feed on them . Wefald reports that one couple who had bought bran at a suburban feed store to use as a nutritional supplement for breakfast cereal , was shocked to find half-inch worms in it . The other and more dangerous risk is that some grains sold in feed stores are labeled " treated seed " and have a poisonous chemical coating to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to humans , animals , and birds . In one incident , Wefald reported , a complaint of illness was traced back to a health food store that had obtained a sack of treated seed and had sold it in small packages to consumers .  | MILK VS . THE STUFF THEY DRINK ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME BASIS for the suspicion that white bread is not all it can be , there is less justification for the health foodist folklore surrounding milk . While some of the prevalent notions may be merely self-deluding or money-wasting , others may be dangerous , not only to the health foodists but to the general public , as in the attacks on milk pasteurization . Pasteurization consists of heating the milk to specified temperatures in order to prevent the spread of harmful bacteria from cattle to humans . Some health foodists feel this process destroys food values . It is true that it does reduce the vitamin C and thiamin values in milk . However , milk is not rich in these vitamins in any case . Certainly few people depend on milk for vitamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dairy distributors to seek repeal of state pasteurization laws , Under Secretary of Agriculture J. Phil Campbell reported in 1972 . The distributors would benefit in two ways ; by saving the cost of pasteurization and by getting a higher price for raw milk as an organic product . In Georgia , Campbell said , pasteurization was nearly repealed in 1972 as a result of such pressures . Even if raw milk is " certified " ( meaning that it meets specific limits for bacterial count and freshness ) , it still is not as safe as pasteurized , various food authorities testify . Charles G. King pointed out that statistics indicated more outbreaks of septic sore 117  | throat from raw certified milk than from pasteurized . " ' As well as eliminating the spread through milk of TB , typhoid , and other pathogenic diseases , pasteurization serves the less urgent but still desirable function of keeping milk palatable in a home refrigerator for several days . Raw milk advocates believe that bacteria multiply faster in pasteurized milk than in raw because heating kills the lactic-acidproducing bacteria that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pasteurized milk stays sweet longer than raw milk because the lactic-acid-producing bacteria are killed . As for multiplication rates , experiments showed that bacteria added to both kinds multiplied at the same rate , the USDA reported . Nor is there any evidence that pasteurization renders inactive any enzyme that human beings must get from milk . You ca n't buy raw milk in most large cities . It is sold in some rural areas . It would be less safe to buy it there , too , even if " certified , " meaning that the farm meets specified high standards for cleanliness . Yet Adelle Davis appearing on the Dick Cavett Show in 1972 recommended raw milk to a national audience ( also " raw butter , " whatever that is ) . Other milk fetishes of the health foodists are less dangerous except , sometimes , to your pocketbook . A cult has developed around goat 's milk . It started with the fact that goat 's milk is more easily digested than cow 's milk due to its smaller fat globules . However , when cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globules , this advantage basically disappears . But from there the notion has developed that " goat 's milk is richer . " Actually the nutrients in both kinds of milk are the same , as shown on the chart in this chapter . Cow 's milk has a little more protein and a little less fat . Goat 's milk has a little more calcium and vitamin A. I would hesitate to tell this to a dedicated health foodist because of its scarcity , but buffalo 's milk has about 12 percent more protein than cow 's and the same high protein efficiency rating ( PER ) . Camel 's milk has no fat at all but is even harder to come by in the U.S. Yogurt has become another legendary food with almost every health food writer and propagandist repeating the same partly mythical testimonials .  | Yogurt is a fermented milk food usually made from partially skimmed milk , or sometimes whole milk , and bacterial cultures which give it a smooth , custardlike consistency and a slightly acid flavor . Different producers use varying ingredients and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various additives to add consistency . Thus , actual nutritional values of various brands may vary somewhat from the sample data given at the end of this chapter and in appendix D. Yogurt is not a miracle food . It is a highly nutritious food with ? usually ? much the same nutrients as whole and low-fat milks but , in some brands , with more calcium , somewhat more protein and B vitamins , although less vitamin A , as shown in the table in this chapter . Economically , it should be noted that at 50 to 80 cents a quart , yogurt buys only a moderate additional amount of protein and several other nutrients compared to ordinary whole milk at 30 cents a quart or less ; 2 percent fat milk with additional solids at 20 cents ; or nonfat dry milk at 10 to 15 cents a quart reconstituted . Yogurt does provide a more nutritious dessert than is usually consumed , and can be used as a dressing in place of high-fat , lowprotein sour cream , and even as a cheese spread , by draining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( On the other hand , cottage cheese has even more protein at much the same cost . ) Another claim made for yogurt , besides its high nutritional quality , is that it produces beneficial changes in intestinal flora . While some authorities have said that yogurt is helpful in replacing bacterial flora after taking antibiotics , in most people the intestinal flora are considered to be normal . Yogurt also is associated with the reputed long life of Bulgarians . Even one of the standard nutritional texts , Never Knowledge of Nutrition , by McCollum and Simonds , said that " Wherever ( yogurt ) is used in liberal amounts as human food the people are of exceptional physical perfection . " But the late Henry C. Sherman pointed out that this may be due to the same nutritive properties of milk . Sherman agreed that fermented milk products may be more digestible because the casein is provided in a finely divided condition . He also felt it was possible that the fermentation products ( lactic acid , alcohol , carbonic acid ) may have a slight stimulating or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Food Science and Technology , University of Nebraska , who is currently investigating the nutritional values of yogurt and other milk products , indicates that there is a need for further research before firm conclusions can be drawn . He told us : Considerably more systematic research work should be done to study in detail their nutritional and other beneficial qualities . We have done some research work with yogurt and yogurt cultures . Last year we isolated a natural antibiotic produced by Lactobacillus bulgaricus , one of the two organisms used in the manufacture of yogurt . The thought here is that through yogurt the consumer may ingest the natural antibiotic-type constituents which may provide him with a sort of natural resistance against infections . However , here again more research work needs to be done . He further commented that his group has observed that yogurt culture synthesizes several B vitamins during growth , while another study ( on mice ) indicated the possibility that yogurt may partially inhibit the proliferation of certain tumor cells . Another high-priced legend has grown up around various nutrition boosters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast . " Virtually all of these products are based on nonfat dry milk . But with the addition of sweetening , flavorings , thickeners , and sometimes additional nutrients , the branded formulations can cost 150 to 300 percent more than the parent skim milk powder . The table of prices for such products shows how the addition of various ingredients or sometimes just sweetening and/or additives can run the price of 64 cents worth of nonfat milk powder ( 1 pound ) all the way up to $2.54 . Tiger 's Milk has become one of the best-known names in Healthfoodland . Actually " Tiger 's Milk " is a brand name applied to several products made by Plus Products , Inc. , including four powdered products and also cookies and high-protein candy bars . But in practice sometimes the name is used loosely by other sellers . I even have bought at a health food bar skim milk flavored with honey and crushed banana , called " Tiger 's Milk , " at 60 cents a glass , no less . Plus Products advertises : " Once upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave them to a small boy . The boy said they made him feel like a Tiger . . . . So the nutritionist called her concoction Tiger 's Milk . As it turns out , we  | use the same nutrients . " The nutritionist is reported to be Adelle Davis but Plus Products did not respond to our inquiries on this question . In any case , the ingredients for Tiger 's Milk Nutrition Booster are basically nonfat milk powder , soybean protein concentrates , brewer 's yeast , additional milk protein , sodium caseinate , and sugar . While the company did not respond to questions about the percentage of sugar , a spokesman did say that 20 to 25 percent of its Instant Shake Mix " is devoted to the improved taste ? sugar . . . would certainly fall into this category along with other ingredients . " Ironically , this product of Healthfoodland not only has a large percentage of that dreaded sugar , but not even the other ingredients are organic . The company said that " because of the volume of Tiger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain enough soybeans and milk from organically grown farms sic and organic dairies to supply all our needs . Rest assured , however , that our products are tested for residual pesticides , and there are none . " As examples of the kind of claims made for such products , Plus Products boasts that Tiger 's Milk is 50 percent protein . But ordinary nonfat milk powder at a fraction of the price is 36 percent protein . The company also says that its product " is a source of vitamin B complex , the vitamins most likely depleted in times of stress " and " is rich in calcium , phosphorus , iron , and potassium all essential minerals . " So , of course , are other milk products and other foods , many providing more economical ways of obtaining these nutrients . One of the most troubling aspects of the mail-order sale of products such as Tiger 's Milk " nutrition boosters " and Sears ' Minit-Meal and Protein Boosters is that the catalogs do n't tell their ingredients . They merely list the nutritional analysis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumer who buys by mail can compare the nutrients in Tiger 's Milk products with Sears ' products , but before buying ? you ca n't compare the ingredients with ordinary foods such as nonfat milk powder . But many national-brand " nonorganic " dry milk products of the same type certainly are no better value . Perhaps the most curious phenomenon is Carnation Slender . As the table of cornparative costs of milk products shows , Carnation Slender costs  | more than twice as much as Carnation Instant Breakfast , though it has much the same ingredients , and almost five times as much as Carnation nonfat milk powder , the major ingredient of both products . Many of these special milk products contain thickeners such as carrageen , sweeteners , and artificial flavors . The second leading ingredient usually is sugar , legally but confusingly called " sucrose . " The most expensive products as well as the cheapest contain the additives and extra sugar . But plain nonfat milk powder does not , thus actually provides even more milk powder at its lower price . In comparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of similar liquid products , note that sixteen ounces of nonfat milk powder makes five quarts of reconstituted nonfat milk . Nonfat milk , of course , has all the nutrients of whole milk except for vitamin A , which is in the missing butterfat . As this is written in the fall of 1972 , FDA has proposed fortification of low-fat and skim milk with vitamin A. In general , too , consumers should be aware that calcium is one of several ingredients previously mentioned that sometimes are lacking in American diets . USDA surveys have shown that the deficiency tends to increase during the summer , probably because children do not have access to milk provided by the school lunch program , and because of higher consumption of iced drinks and soft drinks , the New York State Extension Service has reported . Cheese has become another area of controversy . Adelle Davis wrote : Processed cheeses are made solid largely by the hydrogenation of the butterfat , and have the glossy surface of hydrogenated cooking fats ; they can not be recommended . Natural cheeses are solid because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Natural cheeses are markedly superior to processed cheeses , and uncolored ones are to be preferred to yellow cheeses.12 In almost the same vein Marjorie Miller , another stalwart of the health food movement , wrote that " Processed cheeses should he avoided . They contain hydrogenated fats . Old-fashioned cheeses do not . " 13 This is confused advice indeed . All the authorities we consulted in the cheese-making industry and government replied that hydro-  | genation of the butterfat ( 1 ) does not take place and never has , and ( 2 ) is completely forbidden by government regulation in any case . One cheese industry official , Norman E. Toft , pointed out : Process cheese is manufactured by blending several lots of natural cheese which have been ground to a fairly small-sized particle and heated to probably 165 ? F . . . a small amount ( about 1 1/2% ) of an approved emulsifier is added to prevent the butterfat from separating from the protein of the cheese . . . . During the cooking operation approximately 1 1/2 to 2 percent of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; otherwise , the composition of natural and process cheese is identical . The " glossy surface " that worried Adelle Davis really results from the fact that process cheese is melted and poured into its container in a hot state . The federal standard for pasteurized process cheese verifies that the moisture content may not be " more than 1 percent greater " than the maximum moisture allowed for the parent variety . In the case of American processed cheese , the most widely used cheese , the moisture content may not be more than 40 percent . The moisture limit of the parent cheddar is 39 percent . As I noted in The Great American Food Hoax , American cheese has 105.2 grams of protein per pound ; natural cheddar ( mild ) has 113.4.14 Or , as one industry quality-control manager , L. G. Siapantas , put it , the protein content of natural cheddar is 25 percent and of the process cheese , 23 percent . There is a greater difference in nutrients between these two types and process cheese spreads and cheese foods . Cheeses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lowvalue ingredients ; sometimes nutritionally useful ones such as nonfat dry milk and whey , but also sometimes just vegetable gum to make them more spreadable . Thus , a cheese food may have up to 44 percent moisture ( a euphemism for water ) , and a spread , from 44 to 60 percent depending on the type . An imitation cheese spread may have even more than 60 percent . However , sometimes even these products are useful food values if low priced , despite the high water content , because their added nonfat milk does increase their protein content and other nutrients , and they may he lower in calories than the natural and process versions of the sane varieties .  | figure  | THE WAR OVER ADDITIVES THE PUBLIC IS CAUGHT between two fears today . One is the specter of foods contaminated by additives and pesticides . The other is the threat evoked by chemical manufacturers and agricultural interests that food will cost us more even more , that is , than the high prices we already pay ? if these preservatives and production-stimulating substances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score valid points in their attack on additives : what they dramatically call " the poisons in your food . " No doubt they have often exaggerated the extent of the danger and made sweeping generalizations that do not always stand up . Some additives have a genuine usefulness and proven safety record . In some cases the elimination of additives would present a health danger . For example , there are additives that help protect against the natural toxins in some foods . As noted in chapter 3 , some additives also protect against microbiological risks such as salmonella and botulism ? a more certain danger than any possible " poisoning " from additives . Still , many consumers who have no commitment to an organic ideology are worried when they see the long lists of additives on packages . In all , some 3,000 additives are now in use . Some modern pseudo-convenience foods are virtually sugar , additives , and svnthetic vitamins , as in Awake imitation orange juice which has these ingredients : 12s  | Sugar , syrup , water , corn syrup , orange pulp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , potassium citrate , calcium phosphate , vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) , cellulose gum , natural and artificial flavors , artificial color , vitamin A and vitamin B. Or such invented products may be merely oil , sugar , and additives , as in these ingredients for Lucky Whip topping : Hydrogenated vegetable oil ( containing BHA and BHT added as preservatives ) , sugar , sodium caseinate , glyceryl , lactopalmitate , mono- and di-glycerides , lecithin , glyceryl lacto-oleate , monosodium phosphate derivative or mono- and di-glycerides , artificially flavored and colored . Similarly , many of today 's heat-and-eat foods have numerous additives not only for preservative purposes , but for flavor , to thicken basically cheap ingredients , and even to fool the eye . Here , for example , are the ingredients in a Morton frozen beef dinner : Water , cooked beef , peas , carrots , dehydrated potato flakes , margarine , cornstarch , vegetable oil , flour , salt , malto-dextrin , hydrolyzed vegetable protein , whey solids , monosodium glutamate , caramel color , sugar , sodium caseinate , flavoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor , cysteine and thiamine hydrochloride , and gum arabic . It is exactly such lavish use of additives that has influenced many young people today to become at least part-time health - foodists . While health foodists sometimes unnecessarily alarm themselves since some chemical-sounding additives are merely natural substances such as lecithin ( which they themselves prize ) or sodium caseinate ( a high-protein concentrate from milk ) , still the use of additives has ballooned to the point where they are often needlessly used . Sometimes they are used to delude consumers about the quality and value of products , as in the case of thickeners used to make " diet drinks , " canned milk , baby formula , preserves , and moderate-quality ice cream seem thick and smooth . One certainly needless use of additives is for coloring . Even if the health danger is slight , color additives represent a risk without real benefit . Processors argue that consumers wo n't buy certain products if they are n't a customary color ; maraschino cherries , for example , should he red . But the Giant Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimented with selling  | their own brand of maraschino cherries without the usual but controversial red dye . The true color was a golden yellow . The label said plainly , " no color added . " Consumers had no hesitation in buying the yellow cherries , Esther Peterson , the firm 's adviser reported . ( Ironically , the undyed cherries did not meet the FDA definition for maraschino cherries . ) One of the most controversial substances has been the use of DES ( diethylstilbestrol ) , a female hormone used as a growth stimulant for cattle . The Food and Drug Administration came under heavy fire from the livestock industry in 1972 for banning the use of DES in feed . The hormone had been used in the feed of cattle and sheep for nearly two decades without a known instance of human harm from this use . But DES had been shown to induce cancer in laboratory test animals . Too , several cases of a rare cancer of the vagina were found among young women whose mothers had been treated with DES during pregnancy to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DES by requiring that the hormone not be fed to livestock forty-eight hours before slaughter . When residues still showed up , FDA increased the restriction to seven days before slaughter in the hope of encouraging small feeders to withdraw at least a few days early . But , as the critics of DES and especially the Environmental Defense and National Resources Defense Council had correctly predicted , it was hard to control all the feeders . Residues of DES were found in about 2 percent of cattle livers tested , enough to indicate a problem . Revealingly , FDA changed its mind about permitting the use of DES in feed after it adopted new radioactive-tracer testing techniques . With its earlier , less sensitive test methods FDA had found no measurable traces of DES . As probably happened to other writers , public relations men for the manufacturers of DES for some time had urged me to write articles defending DES . They argued that a ban would push up beef prices . But the USDA , even in supporting the use of DES , had estimated the potential increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry could save at least part of that 3.5 cents through various merchandising economies . The modest price advantage to consumers did not seem to justify even a remote health risk . As a matter of fact , beef prices went up 12  | cents a pound from 1971 to 1972 even with the use of DES . Nor is DES wholly eliminated . As of this writing it can still be used as an implant with a much lower dosage than when used in feed . The following sequence of events in relation to DES shows why many consumers have come to distrust government utterances about the safety of additives in general , and especially of certain specific groups of additives ( discussed later in this chapter ) : March , 1971 : In justifying an increase in the amount of DES to 20 milligrams a day for larger cattle FDA Commissioner Edwards said that " we do not have a good control method for detecting DES residues " but " we do have reasonable assurance from a large number of assays that residues are not occurring with any frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Lyng declared that consumers need not worry that the beef they buy may contain DES . " No residues have been found in any samples checked in 1971 , " he said . October , 1971 : USDA announced that it had found ten " positive " samples in beef livers . June , 1972 : The FDA announced that new monitoring methods adopted by the USDA have found an increase in illegal residues of DES in beef livers to the extent of 2 percent of samples compared to one-half of 1 percent under the previous testing system . July , 1972 : USDA revealed that the rate of illegal residues of DES had increased to 2.3 percent . August , 1972 : FDA announced a ban on the use of DES in feed . Commissioner Edwards now said the " new scientific data " casts " serious doubt on our ability to set rules " that will insure against residues remaining in animal livers at time of slaughter . Certainly the doubts were widespread enough before this reluctant sequence was played out . In a foresighted article in Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while experts she consulted disagreed , many felt that any decision should be on the side of caution . Some twenty-one countries by that time had banned DES from feed.15 An argument over the quality of beef from cattle fed DES also developed , Frances Cerra reported.16 Critics claimed that such beef was too fatty , " mushy , " watery , and did not taste the way beef used to taste . But Dr. Edwards told a congressional committee that the actual scientific data showed that DES causes an  | increase of 7 percent in the amount of protein and " moisture " while causing a decrease in the percentage of fat . " 7 Keep in mind that the actual amounts of the residues were small . In fact , in announcing the ban Dr. Edwards noted that there were no known hazards from the amounts of residues discovered or known instances of harm to human health in seventeen years of use . But under the Delaney Amendment to the Food and Drug Law any substances found carcinogenic in tests on laboratory animals must be banned from food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One result of the ban on DES has been an intensified attack on the Delaney Amendment , by other food manufacturers as well as by cattle feeders , as being too strict , " arbitrary , " and " unrealistic . " The argument of those who want the law modified is that the amount of substances that provoked cancer in laboratory animals was many times larger than humans would ingest . One food industry source quoted by Supermarket News even said that " Americans ' preoccupation with ecological purity of foods may set back agriculture one hundred years and may bring up problems of impurity from the environment that existed a century ago . " ' " s Leading Nixon Administration officials at times also have indicated that they want Congress to modify the Delaney Amendment . In 1969 , after he was forced by the Delaney Amendment to bar cyclamates because they were found to cause bladder cancer in rats , Robert Finch , then Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , said he wanted the law changed . In 1972 , FDA Commissioner Edwards also proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle over the safety additives is centered on the Delaney Amendment . This section of the pure food laws is admittedly strict . But in the judgment of various organizations and institutions working on behalf of safety , the Delaney Amendment provides an extra margin of safety . It also gives FDA personnel a clear reference point for deciding whether to permit the use of an additive , rather than trying to rely on controversial scientific judgments of safety and level of use . If the substance is found to produce cancer in humans or laboratory animals it is simply banned . The government does not have to decide between differing scientific opinions or wait for bodies to be stacked up to prove danger .  | In their efforts to repeal the Delaney Amendment , its opponents have seized on the withering " single rat " argument . As observed by Nicholas Wade in Science , opponents of the present law argue " that if a chemical causes one tumor in a single rat , even when fed in massive doses and by an unusual route ( such as implantation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole industry wiped out . . . . " Thus , the argument goes , scientific judgment about safety is eliminated.19 Another argument aimed at the Delaney Amendment 's jugular is that many ordinary foods can be poisonous if fed in massive amounts ? what has come to be known as the " universal toxin " argument . Sugar , salt , even for a while eggs , have been cited as possible toxins in huge amounts . So have vitamins A and D and K , and iron and copper , in large amounts ; also solanine in potatoes , tannin in tea , oxalic acid found in spinach and rhubarb , and aflotoxins which have been found in peanut meal and in barley used in making beer . Obviously , however , such potential in ordinary foods is no argument for adding additional risks especially when they often are unnecessary as in the case of food dyes , some of the thickeners , and even some of the preservatives , or when there are less worrisome alternate additives . While the critics of the Delaney Amendment stress the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federation of America has rebutted by pointing out that the National Cancer Institute said even very small doses of a carcinogen can cause cancer . Not everyone or even many may develop cancer but it is not possible to identify who can or will , even many years later . It may take fifteen to twenty-five years for cancer to develop , various authorities say . Thus , no one can establish the amount of a cancer-inducing substance that any person can safely tolerate . Dr. Samuel Epstein , of Case Western Reserve Medical School , testified before a Senate Committee in 1972 . The political dynamite inherent in this battle , with scientists and large corporations on one side , and scientists and consumer organizations on the other , was shown by the departure from the FDA of former Commissioner Herbert Ley in 1969.120 Dr. Ley was eased out after banning cyclamates even though his action was legally required by the Delaney Amendment . More than a billion dollars ' worth of food was affected by the cyclamates  | decision alone . Many more billions are involved in other food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other battleground is the GRAS list . GRAS stands for " Generally Regarded as Safe . " This is a list of substances that have been used for some time , and in the opinion of the scientific community are considered safe . Or at least at the time the list was established , no one said they were not safe . The substances in this list are not considered to be additives and so are exempt from the Delaney Amendment . But substances not on the list are additives under the law and so must be tested for safety by the wouldbe user and approved by the FDA for the intended use . What has happened is that at least some of the 674 substances on the original GRAS list formulated in 1960 have turned out to be NARAGRAS ( not all really are generally regarded as safe ) . Thus , cyclamates were on the original GRAS list but now have been removed . Saccharin is among other substances under further study . In fact , in 1969 , because of the continuing criticisms of the GRAS list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This work was expected to take until 1975 to complete . When the job is done , FDA officials expect , there very likely will be a much shorter GRAS list.12 ' Significantly , and as with DES , one reason why the GRAS list has become suspect is that more sophisticated tests for toxicity have been developed . And as FDA Commissioner Edwards told a congressional committee , " we have recognized the inadequacy of relying on the lack of reported human adverse effects as the sole measure of safety . " ' 22 Again , as in the case of DES , FDA in 1965 had said in response to questions that " A review of recent studies on artificial sweeteners shows they are safe as presently used . " But by 1972 , cyclamates were banned altogether and saccharin had been removed from the GRAS list , with its safety under review as this is written , and interim limits put on its use . Showing the futility of trying to escape the additives problem through the products sold in health food stores , at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are among those on the GRAS list under review . One is carob gum ; the other , carrageen , also called Irish Moss . Carrageen , really an extract of seaweed , is much like fruit pectin and is widely used as an emulsifier and thickener for nonfat  | milk products such as Instant Breakfast , Tiger 's Milk Shake , and similar products ? ice cream , custards , canned baby formulas , imitation dessert toppings , cottage cheese , some of the imitation orange drinks , and scores of other products that manufacturers try to make seem thicker than they are . Carrageen was tested as part of the GRAS review . The tests indicated that birth defects can be created when the substance is fed to various species of mammals in extremely high doses . Note the emphasis on " extremely . " Using the traditional hundred-fold safety factor in extrapolating animal results to humans , these findings indicated no evidence of human health hazard based on present levels of usage . Thus , the FDA has concluded that an adequate safety margin exists but announced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regulated . ( No similar results or regulatory action has developed in relation to carob or locust bean gum . Michael Jacobson has suggested that the gum 's laxative action indicated it is not absorbed to any great extent by the body but " impurities that may be present " in this natural substance should be studied.123 While some of the regulated additives and nonregulated substances on the GRAS list are natural food substances , the majority are not . They are chemicals . There is no reason to believe that most are not safe . But since questions have been raised about some , what 's a consumer to do ? The most-immediate consumer needs are to defend the Delaney Amendment , encourage a thorough GRAS review , and demand more consistent , closer inspection , and surveillance of short cuts in processing by both federal and state agencies to avoid such disasters as the 1971 botulism incidents . It should be realized that there are unending political and industry pressures on the FDA . For example , in 1959 when FDA banned cranberries tainted by aminotriazole , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education and Welfare Secretary , Arthur S. Flemming , suffered damaging attacks from farm organizations , many congressmen , the Journal of the American Medical Association , and Barron 's , a financial weekly , which called the FDA officials " health zealots . " ( Congress subsequently compensated the cranberry growers for their misdeeds to the tune of $K.5 million , just as in the proposals pending in 1973 to corn-  | pensate beverage bottlers and food manufacturers for losses from the ban on cyclamates . ) Even in less dramatic actions , FDA is under constant pressure from the numerous lawyers and Washington lobbyists for the food industry . As has been documented in many instances , there also is a frequent personnel interchange between the FDA and the industry it regulates . There also are numerous instances on the record of FDA 's own laxity and tardiness in inspections and warnings . In one of the most ironic incidents , FDA did not know that a Long Island , New York , food manufacturer had produced 120,000 pounds of breading material contaminated with bits of rubber gasket until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The informant had learned of the problem from memos the U.S. Commerce Department had sent to its field inspectors to alert them to the situation.124 Apparently the FDA and Commerce Department do not talk to each other directly . Ruth Jordan , Washington labor press writer , reported that the Agriculture Department had failed to heed a warning from its own inspectors that federal inspection was inadequate at the Parris , Texas , Campbell soup plant . It was from this plant that botulism-tainted chicken-vegetable soup was shipped . According to the union representing meat and poultry inspectors , the U.S. Department of Agriculture had turned over quality control to the plant management with only limited inspection by the government . This , of course , is the worst side of the picture of government supervision . There are many public-minded FDA employees whose efforts can be strengthened through consumer support countervailing the ceaseless and often arrogant industry pressures . Another self-defense , while the GRAS review is proceeding , is to restrain your own consumption of highly processed foods that contain many chemical substances . One reason for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additives as literally thousands of processed " convenience " foods have come on the market in recent years . A modern supermarket now stocks 8,000 to 10,000 products compared to 1,500 and 2,000 in the late 1940s . The result is lower turnover with increased need for preservatives . You also have to evaluate your own trade-off ? the benefits of  | processed foods containing additives vs. the risk . Thus , for some people saccharin may be useful enough to offset any remote risk . ( On the other hand , some , although not all , of the scientists studying the results of the cyclamates tests on rats concluded that the advantages from using this sweetener did not warrant the risks . ) Calcium propionate and sodium propionate , used as mold inhibitors in cakes and bread , have been well-investigated by both consumer and industry experts and are harmless and preferable to the dubious molds which develop in bread and cake . Also , of course , by reading labels you can choose among the processed foods , selecting those with the fewest , and least controversial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may allay the often-voiced fear that even though chemical additives are used in tiny amounts , the cumulative or synergistic effect of consuming them in many foods may be serious . Reduced sales of additive-laced products also may encourage processors to be more conservative in their use . In a survey of alternatives of the same foods , Mrs. Margolius found many examples . You can buy cottage cheese with or without carrageen or vegetable gums ( which under FDA regulations can be carob or many other gums without specific identification ) . Yogurts are available with or without preservatives and emulsifiers . Some ready-to-eat cereals are available without additives even though many have such controversial additives as BHT and BHA . Among the popular dry and prepared sauces , some have additives , others none . Some imitation products have many additives . A diet-type imitation salad dressing proclaims on the front panel NO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS . But the list of ingredients in smaller type on the side includes sodium benzoate , potassium sorbate , calcium disodium EDTA , and BHT . One low-calorie French dressing includes polysorbate 60 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing has potassium sorbate , calcium disodium EDTA , BHA and BHT , as well as artificial colors . You may feel it is worth trading calories for additives without the effort of mixing your own " diet " dressings of vinegars , lemon juice , small amounts of vegetable oils , tomato paste , and spices . If you do mix your own , you wo n't have to worry about the addit ives .  | Unfortunately , processed foods are not required to be labeled with their ingredients when government standards of identity have been established and the products meet the standards . The lack of labeling on modern ice cream comes under particular attack since not even artificial colors , flavors , and chemical preservatives need be labeled . Commissioner Bess Myerson pointed out that ice cream is no longer a simple milk product . At present more than one hundred ingredients including many chemical and mineral substances can be legally added . She especially attacked an FDA proposal to excuse manufacturers from listing calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate as ingredients . Even without these further exceptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label , artificial flavors , carrageen , tetrasodium hexametaphosphate , polysorbate 80 , carob or locust bean gum , propylene glycol , and many other substances that you do n't usually think of as frozen desserts . Many other standardized foods also do not need to list on labels their ingredients , or only certain optional ingredients . Frances Cerra pointed out that the FDA standard for readyprepared French dressing ( which , like that for mayonnaise , need not be shown on the label ) specifies olive oil , vinegar , sugar , catsup , mustard , egg yolks , or ( in lieu of egg yolks ) , gum acacia , or carob bean gum , or extract of Irish moss , or pectin , or propylene glycol ester of alginic acid.125 Thus , you may think you still are getting egg yolk in your salad dressing as in the old days , when you are really getting extract of seaweed . James Turner , author of The Chemical Feast , has urged that full listings be required while the GRAS review proceeds ; among other reasons because people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances they need to avoid . The Virginia-based Federation of Homemakers in urging complete listing of ingredients , and not just such euphemisms as " sweeteners " or " freshness preservers , " cited the case of a tenyear-old boy who died in 1972 after he had eaten ice cream containing peanut material to which he was extremely sensitive . Some of the scientists associated with industry oppose these requests with a Big Daddy argument that too much information would he confusing . Fven a scientist of the stature of Dr. Bernard I .. Oser , chairman of the Food and Drug Research Laboratories ,  | a private company , told a seminar for food editors sponsored by the Manufacturing Chemists Association : Does it inform the consumer , to list chemicals whose identity and purpose are rarely understood , even by informed consumers ? On the contrary , I believe that such excessive scientific gobbledegook only serves to create doubt and confusion in the minds of those who bother to read labels . Instead of burdening the consumer with technical descriptions of contents and of nutritional values . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any , are present . In any case , none but common foods should be declared . . . and only in special cases should chemicals be named and then only if their functions are also stated in simple terms.126 While Dr. Oser 's recommendation for stating the functions of added chemicals certainly have merit , consumers do have a right to know what 's in their food even if only some will use the information . Full , frank declaration would be educational , especially if functions are stated . A further effect would be to encourage manufacturers to avoid the less necessary additives , especially those under question . A full declaration also has economic value to consumers in telling them whether they are paying for egg yolks or vegetable gum . While this chapter is by no means a complete guide to additives ? several comprehensive guides are listed under References ? it may be useful to summarize which additives and GRAS-list substances have become a matter of inquiry or concern in addition to those mentioned earlier such as carrageen . BHT and BHA You probably have often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many oil-containing processed foods such as potato chips , dry cereals , candies , and vegetable oils . These letters are shorthand for Butylated Hydroxytoluene and Butylated Hydroxyanisole , chemicals used primarily as antioxidants to retard rancidity . While no damage to laboratory animals has been observed at low levels , liver damage was observed at high levels of consumption . Large quantities of BHA and BHT fed to pregnant mice also were found to produce changes in brain chemistry and result in abnormal behavior patterns in their offspring , in tests by scientists at Loyola University.127 It should be noted that the amounts  | used in the test were much larger than those normally consumed by humans . Still , BHT has been banned in Britain . While most defenders of the wide use of additives , such as Dr. Oser , claim as a main benefit the thousands of new food products available to us today , the fact is many of these products serve no useful financial or nutritional purpose . Some even are financially damaging and nutritionally inferior . Thus , to market packaged Noodles Romanoff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cheese , sour cream solids , and other flavorings and fillers , the manufacturer must add BHA and other additives to preserve the sour cream solids , plus artificial flavors , artificial color , and still more additives for the other ingredients . Preparing a similar casserole at home would avoid not only needless ingestion of at least some of these additives but would save the excessive price of such premixed products . The true cost of the noodles in this product comes to $1.36 a pound or more than the price of steak . Nor is there any genuine convenience . This product still must be cooked just like ordinary noodles . As this example shows , it may be true that controversial additives like BHA do preserve , but often they preserve products which we do not really need , such as the small amount of sour cream solids in premixed Noodles Romanoff . Bleaching Agents As noted in Appendix B , Why They Use Additives , flour millers accelerate the whitening of wheat flour with chemical bleaches . While bleached flours do not have the nutrients of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some authorities believe further testing may be needed , as discussed in chapter 8 . Nitrates and Nitrites That pink color in your frankfurters , bologna , corned beef , bacon , and other cured meats is not really the color of red meat but is supplied by the controversial sodium nitrate and nitrite . These additives also are used in smoked , cured fish such as smoked salmon , smoked sablefish , and smoked shad . Sodium nitrate may be used with sodium nitrite , although nowadays the nitrite form is mostly used . In any case , under some conditions nitrate can be converted into nitrite in the stomach . Only nitrite  | reacts " with some amines to form nitrosamine , which may be carcinogenic , " points out Steven R. Tannenbaum , associate professor of Food Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Genetic mutations in laboratory animals also have been reported . Nitrites in large amounts can be especially harmful to small children . As well as the tumor-causing potential found in laboratory tests on animals , nitrites " fix " or tie up hemoglobin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small children , of course , have a relatively small amount of hemoglobin . In addition , nitrites can combine with amines which occur in processed meats and in other foods such as cereals and beer , and also in some medicines such as antihistamines . In 1971 , USDA scientists found traces of dimethyl nitrosamine in three meat products ( two dried beef , one cured pork ) out of forty-eight samples tested . While some scientists consider the production of nitrosamines in the stomach of humans to be " unlikely , " R. C. Shank , of Massachusetts Institute of Technology , told a 1972 symposium of the American Chemical Society that tumors had been produced in a variety of laboratory animals including dogs , and the evidence indicated man would not be resistant . Shank listed findings of nitrosamines in smoked herring , smoked haddock , smoked sausage and ham , edible mushrooms , and fried bacon.128 In one notorious mishap in 1970 , a man died from consuming a relatively large amount of sodium nitrite , which had been bottled by error as Spice of Life meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. H. Fountain , of North Carolina , called attention to an FDA report of a three-year-old boy 's death after eating a frankfurter with 600 to 1,000 parts per million nitrite concentration ( much greater than the legal level ) . There is reason to believe that the cosmetic purpose of nitrites is unnecessary . For example , sales tests by the Berkeley Co-ops showed that consumers apparently will accept franks with their natural cooked color ( a light tan like that of bratwurst ) . There is another , more rational purpose for nitrites than merely the cosmetic , fast-cure , or flavor effects . Nitrates and nitrites are preservatives and help prevent botulism . No cases of botulism have ever been traced to commercially prepared foods treated with nitrates and nitrites , the FDA has said . Scientists from  | Union Carbide Corp . and other chemical manufacturers and meat processors at this writing are running scared because of the fear that these compounds may be banned altogether . So they are pushing the botulism argument hard . But testimony before congressional committees by Dr. William Lijinski , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged that FDA forbid the use of nitrite as a color fixative , but permit its use as a preservative , at lower levels , until a substitute is found . Use as a preservative only could enable reduction of the present permissible levels of these substances in food substantially , Dr. Lijinski testified . Even for color , the House intergovernmental relations subcommittee reported in 1972 , a British study found some twenty-five years ago that one-twentieth of the amount of nitrite allowed in this country is adequate to fix the color of bacon . Even the flavor effects of nitrites can be obtained by levels lower than now permitted , government scientists have said . Uncured franks do become rancid sooner than those containing nitrates as these substances slow down the oxidation of fatty acids , according to Mary Ruth Nelson , a former Berkeley Co-op home economist . ' 29 Mary Gullberg reported that while the Berkeley Co-ops were able to market nitrate-free frankfurters , a California meat packer had tried to produce nitrate-free lunch meats and bologna with less success . Unlike franks , these are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in lunch bags . The lunch-meat formulas were checked by the University of California at Davis , to see which bacteria might grow in them when unrefrigerated for two days . Unfortunately , one strain of salmonella did thrive in these tests.130 Bess Myerson urged support for a 1972 proposal by the USDA which would require the labeling of packaged meats to indicate the ingredients in curing solutions . In general , increasing concern has developed over the possible greater effect on preweaning infants of nitrate and nitrite and even of additives which may otherwise have had a long safety record , as monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) , a flavor enhancer . The cells and organs of very young infants may be particularly susceptible to the influence of poor nutrition and to toxic factors , according to Leo Friedman , director of the FDA Division of Toxicology . " ' ( This may explain the considerable difference in  | findings obtained with preweaning infant animals compared with those with more mature animals in tests of MSG . After public protests following reports of brain damage to infant laboratory animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although there was no evidence of harm to human infants , the National Research Council concluded that there was no benefit to infants either . ) Nitrite and nitrate also have been used increasingly in cured fish , both as a color fixative and a preservative , especially after three major outbreaks of botulism were recorded in the 1960 's from smoked fish of Great Lakes origin . The FDA has found that some fish-processing plants have exceeded the permitted level of 200 parts per million . The FDA has felt that the added nitrite in smoked fish is necessary because of the potential for botulism ; " The benefit-risk ratio in this situation appears to weigh in favor of nitrite addition , " Commissioner Charles C. Edwards has said . In late 1972 , as this was written , the FDA did propose to ban the use of nitrate in smoked salmon and shad , and nitrite in smoked tuna . Revealingly , one processor was denied permission to add nitrites and nitrates to hamburger . No additives are permitted in fresh meat ( or poultry ) , since color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the amount of lean meat in hamburger ) . However , the permitted use of nitrates to give a pink color to franks facilitates an economic deception . The pink color helps to conceal the fact that modern franks contain an average of 28 percent added fat with a corresponding reduction in the amount of protein ( now about 12 percent ) . Vacuum-packed cured meats such as canned hams may be a particular hazard without nitrates . FDA scientists believe that in vacuum-packaged foods the growth of aerobic ( oxygen-using ) organisms is curtailed and shelf life appears to be extended because visible spoilage has not occurred . But the additional shelf life may be long enough for an organism such as botulinum to grow and produce toxin. ' 32 In tests run in conjunction with FDA , the American Meat Institute also has reported that preliminary findings indicate a need for nitrites to prevent botulism in canned meat products . In 1972 , and despite protests from consumer organizations , the I ISl ) A decided to allow still another chemical to the nitrates , so-  | dium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is sodium acid pyrophosphate ( SAPP ) , an acidulant which reduces by twenty minutes the time it takes other chemicals to turn franks pink . An industry expert , F. Willard Griffith of Griffith Laboratories , advised me that the use of SAPP provides " slightly more acidity , " thus allowing higher temperatures , which externally kills bacteria quicker , and the shorter time permits higher internal temperature . Mr. Griffith also maintained that the higher temperatures do insure that less bacteria is carried over to the finished product , and the use of SAPP also reduces the residual nitrite . The SAPP itself is safe , he noted ; it is neutralized by the natural buffering agents in the meat before the product is finished . SAPP has been used in curing hams for some ten to fifteen years and is also widely used in baking powders . Nor will processors who do n't have the needed high-speed , high-temperature automatic equipment use SAPP , Griffith reassured . But there is no nutritional benefit . In fact , there may be an economic disadvantage to consumers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cooking out . But these juices are mainly added fat and water . ( Franks are permitted to have up to 30 percent added fat and 10 percent added water . ) The controversy over SAPP had an ironic sidelight . For some time political leaders have been urging consumers to write to government agencies and make known their views about proposals for regulations affecting them . In this case , 447 comments were submitted to the USDA on its proposal to allow use of the cure accelerator , the federal Office of Consumer Affairs reported . Most were from worried consumers opposing the use of SAPP . However , USDA officials noted that most of the consumer comments " consisted of opinions without supportive data or information . " They went ahead and approved the proposal despite the unusual mail turnout against it . Obviously , the ordinary consumer is not a scientist and ca n't provide " supportive data . " Nor do most housewives have secretaries to prepare lengthy documents . Apparently government officials are happy to hear from the public . But do n't expect them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data . In general it seems advisable to make sure that franks and other cured meats are cooked thoroughly at home , for bacterial  | protection . Until further research on the toxic effects of nitrites is accomplished , another safeguard is to avoid unusually heavy use of franks and other cured meats , especially by young children . But , as with many other foods , it is difficult to escape nitrates simply by buying " health food " franks and other additive-free cured meats at approximately twice the price . ( In economic terms , a leading brand of additive-free franks sold in health food stores , the Shiloh brand , and other moderate-fat franks about 22 percent fat are worth about 17 percent more than the commercial franks since the moderate-fat brands are about 14 percent protein . ) There is no place to hide from nitrates since they enter your foods from vegetables or , in some areas , water supplies , especially from wells , point out Dr. I. A. Wolff and Dr. A. E. Wasserman , of the USDA Eastern Regional Research Laboratory.133 Nitrates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many vegetables including spinach , beets , radishes , eggplant , celery , lettuce , collards , and turnip greens . A high level of nitrates in vegetables may be caused especially by high levels of fertilization ( particularly during the ripening period ) , and by other growing conditions such as plant nutrient deficiencies , lack of water , and plant damage from chemical treatments . High nitrate levels of some water supplies , especially from wells , comes from a number of sources , Wolff and Wasserman advise . These include agricultural use of fertilizers , nitrogen fixation by microorganism and plants , and especially decomposition of plant and sewage wastes followed by the leaching of nitrates into groundwater . As with nitrates and nitrites in cured meats , the lesser stomach acidity of young infants under four months is the age cited by Wolff and Wasserman may permit growth of microorganisms , which can reduce nitrate to nitrite . Thus , water of high nitrate content is " a real hazard " to infants . Oscar Lorenz , a University of California researcher , has reported increasingly high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I asked Wasserman whether heavy use of commercial fertilizer was responsible for the large accumulations of nitrates in vegetables , which he and Wolff had cited . If so , the organic gardening and farming adherents would have a point in their favor . Wasserman pointed out that organic material is decomposed to ammonia or ammonium compounds , which are then oxidized to  | nitrates . It is the nitrate , whether from organic matter or chemically prepared fertilizers , that is taken up from the soil by the plant . Moreover , Dr. Wasserman advised : Records are available from the period before the extensive use of chemical fertilizers that show problems with grain and forage containing high nitrate after growth in soils with naturally high nitrate content or after heavy fertilization with natural fertilizers . Dr. Wasserman noted that these data also have been confirmed by scientists at the USDA Plant Industry Station in Beltsville , Maryland . ( For a further discussion of organic vs. chemical fertilizers , see chapter 11 . ) Artificial Colors Most of the evidence indicates that the food industry is on shaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial colors and dyes , and so is the government in its frequent hesitancy to take stronger action against them . Not all food colors are artificial . Some natural ones even have nutritional value , like carotene which converts to vitamin A in the body . Nor need the phrase " coal tar dyes " be as frightening as it sounds . Coal tar dyes are not coal tar any more than some of the synthetic fibers you wear are coal , air , and water . But as noted earlier in this chapter there is no real benefit to the public in the wide use of artificial dyes today in many products including ice cream , gelatine desserts , sausage , breakfast cereals , cakes , candies , carbonated , and other beverages , Florida oranges and tangelos , sweet and red potatoes , and other foods . About 10 to 12 percent of all food products nowadays have some added coloring . Some wear as much dye and other cosmetics as an aging movie star . One consumer-trained journalist , Gerald Blank , reported that it has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificially colored " or " artificially flavored " any more , including pumpernickel bread ( many brands of which have caramel coloring to enhance that dark whole grain look ) . Even the food industry 's claim that the public would not buy these products if they were not a customary color has been contradicted by consumer acceptance of the yellow cherries and tan franks previously cited . Furthermore , consumers do not insist on dyed cereals . Oats are not normally orange , cherry , and lemon  | color as in Froot Loops , nor blue , purple , and green as in Kaboom . Nor is corn flour normally orange as in Quangaroos . Almost every dry cereal I checked lists artificial colors , although sometimes under the euphemism of " certified color . " This contradictory use of artificial colors to attract the attention of children to overpriced oversugared cereals exposes the self-serving nature of the industry 's arguments for the use of artificial colors in general . Consumer organizations have been especially resentful of the use of artificial colors without notice to the public , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and red potatoes , even though the law requires such notice . ( It is not considered advisable to eat , suck , or use in marmalade the peel of winter-harvested Florida oranges whether or not the skin is stamped " color added . " ) As the result of many outcries , late in 1972 FDA did institute a reduction of about 30 percent in the general use of Red No. 2 , the most widely used artificial color , and a reduction of about 50 percent in its use in beverages ( where about half of all current production of this coloring agent is used ) . The FDA itself had become concerned because tests by Russian and FDA scientists indicated that Red No. 2 , even though in wide use for some seventy years " without any reported health hazard , " did interfere with reproduction in animals when used extensively . The consumer groups , however , have considered the 30 percent reduction to be insufficient . An especially strong criticism of inadequate testing of colors was made in congressional testimony by Michael F. Jacobson , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Interest . He warned that not only is Red No. 2 a cause of concern , but if banned , industry would " probably replace it " with a mixture of Violet 1 and Red 40 . Violet 1 ( used in the inspection stamps on meats and also in cereals ) , he warned , has been inadequately tested , but one study indicated it might cause cancer . The data on Red 40 needed further study , and Yellow 5 , also used in large quantity in cereals , needed further long-term testing for carcinogenicity , in Jacobson 's estimate.134 ( Yellow dyes also are used in commercial cakes to make them look " buttery , " Consumer Action Now pointed out . ) Until the FDA responds to pressures to further reduce color-  | ing , the consumer should weigh the alternatives in the products available in the supermarkets . While all commercial cereals have some additives , some have relatively few , including no artificial coloring , or a lesser amount as shown by the position of this item in the list of ingredients ( arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Vitaman , have many . Here is the list of ingredients in Kaboom , which proclaims itself the " vitamin and iron cereal " : Sugar , oat flour , degermed yellow cornmeal , corn syrup , wheat starch , dextrose , cornstarch , salt , gelatin , iron phosphate , monosodium phosphate , natural and artificial flavors , niacinamide , gum arabic , artificial colors , citric acid , vitamin A palmitrate , riboflavin , pyridoxine , thiamine , sodium benzoate , vitamin D , vitamin Biz . Freshness preserved by BHT . Brominated Vegetable Oils The Expert Committee on Food Additives of the Food and Agricultural Organization and World Health Organization recommended that brominated vegetable oils ( a dispersant added to soft drinks and processed fruit juices ) should not be used because short-term studies with animals demonstrated that high doses led to degenerative cardiac lesions. ' 3s In 1972 , FDA considered deleting the clearance for optional use of BVO but instead issued an interim order reducing the level permitted in soft drinks . ' 36 Note that soft drinks , or carbonated beverages if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artificial flavorings . Here , obviously , is another area where alternatives are available to concerned consumers . BVO is a revealing example of how the use of one additive may lead to another . A main use of l3VO is to keep the orange color dispersed in orange drinks . Sulfur dioxide , and sulfite ( a powder ) are often used as a preservative for dried fruits , other dried foods , and some dry wines and other beverages . Sulfur dioxide is under fire from some critics of additives because it destroys part of thiamine ( vitamin B , ) . This particular point should not be too great a concern because the use of sulfur dioxide is barred in foods rich in thiamine . On the other hand , some countries where wine consumption is generally high have become concerned about the risks to people who drink a great deal of wine.1 '  | Amino Acids Amino acids ( see chapter 5 for list ) sometimes are added to processed foods as nutritional supplements and sometimes as a preservative . You would think that with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of amino acids that such additives might be highly desirable . But as in many other food situations discussed in this book , you can get too much of a good thing . In 1972 the FDA moved to take off the GRAS list the amino acids previously included . Significantly , the agency pointed out that the mere natural presence of an amino acid in unprocessed form does not qualify it as safe for addition in pure form as a component of a formulated or unprocessed food . FDA observed : A risk to health exists when a free amino acid produces toxic or other adverse effects . A potential risk to health also exists when a free amino acid is added at a level that produces an " unbalanced " protein ( one used inefficiently for growth ) , or that produces an amino acid-imbalanced diet . Experimental animal studies have shown that the adverse effects of these imbalances are suboptimal food intake , growth retardation , and degeneration of certain organs . Excessive intakes of most of the nutritionally essential amino acids ( for example , histidine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( for example , tyrosine and glycine ) will produce undesirable biochemical and pathological effects in animals . This indicates a potential health risk for man . ' " As discussed in chapter 5 , the amino acids in egg protein are in such quantity and proportion that nutritionists use them as the standard for high-quality protein . Thus , the FDA feels that the limit for safe addition of an amino acid should be the difference between the amount present in egg protein and the amount present in the original protein to which the amino is being added . Nor does FDA want processors to add amino acids to food products if , in most cases , the original protein has a protein efficiency ratio ( PER ) of 2.50 or more . So that is how a GRAS substance becomes an " additive " and subject to regulation when removed from the GRAS list . Antibiotics in Feed As well as DES , concern has been voiced over the use of antibi ( flies in livestock , and poultry feed . This fear appears to be at least partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used to stimulate growth , but also to prevent disease . This creates concern that some of the antibiotics may cause bacteria in the animals to become resistant to these and other antibiotics , and that the resistant bacteria may then be transmitted to humans and establish resistant bacteria.139 As a result of findings of low levels of antibiotic residues in meats , milk , and eggs , in 1972 FDA moved to further limit antibiotics used in animal feed , especially those antibiotics also used to treat humans . Some antibiotics most critically needed for treatment of humans , such as chloramphenicol and semisynthetic penicillins , always have been barred . Many combination products are being eliminated because of insufficient safety and efficacy data . Depending on whether the pharmaceutical companies themselves began adequate safety and efficacy tests , by mid-1973 the FDA plan was to ban antibiotics for poultry and livestock unless prescribed by a veterinarian . While antibiotic treatments appear to be more genuinely useful than does DES , the risks appear even more certain . Thus , the FDA surveillance of the feed and livestock industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that poultry may be dipped in antibiotic solutions to preserve freshness . Such use is prohibited by federal law although there is not complete certainty that small local growers and sellers are violating this law . There have also been complaints about the use of arsenic preparations . These have been used in the feed and drinking water of chickens , turkeys , and swine for over twenty-five years , FDA Commissioner Edwards reported in 1971 . Arsenic is present naturally in the tissues of all animals and plants in varying concentrations ( lowest in milk , highest in fish and shellfish ) . FDA had established what it considered to be safe tolerances for residues for chicken and turkeys . However , in 1968 a startling 28 percent of the samples of poultry tested exceeded the tolerance . Fortunately , when the poultry industry was alerted to the problem , the figure dropped thereafter and by 1970 was down to 7 percent . " ? This summary has spotlighted some of the substances which have been of special concern and attention in the early 1970s . It  | by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered but inconclusive fears have been voiced about carboxymethyl cellulose , a thickening agent widely used in many beverages , ice cream , baby foods , and other products . Calcium propionate , used to inhibit mold and " rope " in bread , has come under question , although with no substantial evidence of hazard so far , and is being reviewed in the FDA GRAS review . Criticisms also have been made of benzoic acid , Moneysworth newsletter pointed out in a 1971 interview with Commissioner Edwards . Too , certain compounds such as EDTA ( ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid ) , which you have noticed in many ingredients lists , are able to tie up metals such as iron and manganese so that they can not be utilized by the body . In other instances , additional nutrients may be desirable to protect against harmful elements . Thus , iron , vitamin C , copper , and the amino acid L-cysteine help protect against the toxic effects of cadmium , which is naturally present in food , water , and air . Appendix E provides a list of often-used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which synthetic . These can not be taken too literally as guides to safety . A few of the natural additives such as carrageen have been questioned , and some of the synthetic have a long record of safe use , despite occasional expressions of suspicion . While all of us can control to some extent our intake of the more suspect additives , by reading the labels and avoiding the growing parade of " convenience " foods that lean heavily on additives , still , government regulation remains our final defense . The most thorough regulatory effort yet suggested is provided for in a bill that was introduced into Congress in 1972 by Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin . If enacted , it would require a showing of need as well as safety for all food additives . FDA officials , too are coming to feel that additives should be shown to be useful as well as safe . " If the additive has no definite benefit , why use it at all ? " Ogden Johnson , head of the FDA Division of Nutrition , commented.14 '  | ORGANIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health food movement is for socalled organic agriculture . There certainly are useful environmental benefits from some aspects of organic farming techniques . But any claimed nutritional benefits are more speculative or mythical than documented , and there may be more health dangers than benefits . The term " organic " has come to mean different things to different people . Originally emphasis was placed on the use of manure and plant wastes instead of chemical fertilizers . But Robert Rodale now defines " organically grown " as also including nonuse of " toxic pesticides " and avoidance of weed killers.142 Other health foodists also tend to lump together fertilizers with other targets of criticism . Thus , Adelle Davis wrote in Let 's Cook It Right : " Since fish are not given hormones and tranquilizers nor fed on commercial fertilized soils covered with poison sprays , as are our meat animals , their flesh is far more wholesome as food than most of our meat . " 143 That is a large statement indeed , even without the more-recent concerns over mercury and other contaminants found in fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need to separate the fertilizer issue from the pesticide problem , which is discussed in chapter 12 . Chemical fertilizers may pose no actual health dangers to your food . But some pesticides and chemical additives may pose such dangers . When weighing organic vs. chemical fertilizers , both the claimed effect on food  | nutrients and the effect on the environment must be considered . The constant and often illogical attempt of the organic advocates to lump together all agricultural chemicals as a threat to you is in neither your nor the public interest . Organic advocates claim that crops grown with organic fertilizer are more nutritious than crops grown with chemical fertilizers on " depleted " soils . Some organic advocates go much further and claim that chemical fertilizers " poison " the soil . Chemical fertilizers also are called inorganic , synthetic , commercial , and , most bitterly , " artificial " fertilizers . They have been charged with ruining our soil and our health , and causing a great many illnesses including heart disease , arthritis , ulcers , and even cancer . Thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : from the commercial organic food and vitamin industry on the one hand , and the agricultural chemicals industry on the other . The overwhelming scientific testimony and data indicates there is no significant nutritional difference between crops grown with organic and chemical fertilizers . Any organic matter must first be broken down by the microorganisms in the soil into its chemical components before a plant can use them . Government , university , and other scientists , including some who are the heroes of the environmentalists , have said that usually there is no way to distinguish between crops grown with organic or inorganic fertilizers , other factors being equal . Biologist Barry Commoner , a leader of the ecology movement , points out that humus ( so-called organic matter ) is broken down by bacteria to release inorganic forms of nitrogen . Then this " is taken up by the plant roots and reconverted to organic matter , such as the plant 's protein . " ' " A number of actual growing experiments have been conducted to determine if there is any difference between crops produced with organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown that fertilization increases yield but does not affect the nutrients significantly . One such experiment was made in Michigan on a long-unused farm , for a period of ten years , with some fields fertilized in different ways and some not fertilized at all . Neither the nutrients in the crops nor the farm animals fed from the different fields were affected , although the yields were much greater from the fertilized fields . at Cornell University . One experiment compared levels of certain vitamins and minerals in plants grown on different plots of a Long Island soil . Some of these plots had a history of organic fertilization . Other plots had received only inorganic fertilizers . The levels of some of the vitamins and essential trace minerals were essentially the same in plants grown on plots receiving the two different kinds of fertilizer , W. H. Allaway , director of the laboratory , . reported at the New York City health food hearings in 1971 . This is not to say that it is unnecessary to add organic matter to the soil . As Allaway and all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make soils easier to till and absorb and hold water for use by plants . The organic advocates sound many alarms about deficient soils . In some cases organic materials can benefit deficient soils but in others an inorganic fertilizer may be more effective . For example , Allaway pointed out that there are many areas , especially in the western states , where crop growth is limited , and plants are yellow and low in carotene ( provitamin A ) , because the soil is deficient in forms of iron that can be used by plants . Adding animal manures to these areas increases the level of available iron in the soil , and results in higher yields of plants and higher carotene levels . This is a very practical and widely used way of correcting the iron deficiency in these soils . On the other hand , many soils in the southeast were in their native state very deficient in phosphorus , essential for all plant , animal , and human life . Plants from these soils were low in phosphorus . So farmers there used inorganic phosphorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. Williams , who discovered vitamin K and is a hero of the organic movement on other issues , also has indicated support for the use of chemical fertilizers . He told about experiments which showed that when three varieties of plants were grown on soil fertilized with manure only , the nutritional was lower than when the organic fertilizer was supplemented with a **25;252;TOOLONG mixture . Williams also cited experiments in Germany in which a similar fertilizer formula not only increased the yield of oats over twenty times but also doubled the level of thiamine in the oats , and increased it 37 percent in millet . ' 45  | One of the most recent experiments ( 1971 ) in organic vs. commercial-type gardening was by the Virginia Polytechnic Institute Extension Division . The results were a disaster for the garden fertilized with organic fertilizer and using no pesticides , R. C. Lambe , Extension Specialist in plant pathology , told me . Insects and soil-borne disease organisms completely wiped out some of the crops while causing low yields on others . Five rows of tomatoes , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chemically fertilized and protected plot . Five rows of cucumbers yielded only 29 pounds in the organic plot compared to 205 pounds in the chemically protected plot . One row of squash , grown under chemical protection , yielded 157 pounds compared to 3 pounds under organic methods . The organic plot produced no eggplant at all due to flea beetles , which attacked the young plants . But 155 pounds came from the chemically protected plot . In all , the chemically protected plot yielded about 800 percent more produce . The organic garden was fertilized with 1,000 pounds of dehydrated cow manure , at a cost of $50 . The chemically protected plot received 100 pounds of 10-10-10 fertilizer . It cost $3.15 . In this way , both gardens received the same amounts ( and properly applied ) of nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium , Lambe said . Before planting , the chemically protected garden was treated with methyl bromide , a fumigant applied to eradicate weeds , soil insects , nematodes , and soil diseases . Total cost was $37.08 . The organic garden was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $18.00 . The costs of the chemically fertilized and protected plot actually were about 35 percent higher . But the yields were much greater . In all fairness , these results were obtained after just one year of testing . Longer tests , of course , might provide more certain conclusions since it does take a few years to build up the humus level in organically fertilized soils . A test in South Dakota directly compared results from organic and inorganic fertilizers . During a three-year period a comparable investment in organic fertilizer returned twelve bushels per acre less corn annually than conventionally fertilized corn , reported Earl P. Adams , agronomist at South Dakota University . Interestingly , the organically fertilized corn had lower nitrogen and phos-  | phorus content , and contained less protein than corn receiving conventional fertilizers . The facts are that using only or even mostly organic fertilizer from the immediate area is bound to perpetuate or even aggravate the deficiencies present in that soil . Organic fertilizers can only return to the soil the elements the soil provides , Ruth Leverton observed . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide sufficient nutrients . As any home gardener who has bought dried cow manure must know , it has only 1 percent nitrogen , zero phosphate , and 1 percent potash ( 1-0-1 ) . In comparison , chemical or synthetic plant foods usually are 5-10-5 or 10-6-4 and sometimes 20-10-10 . Even the prized and expensive organic bone meal is not balanced in its nutrients , providing , as my wife found in comparing such fertilizers , only 1-21-0 . The highest nitrogen organic fertilizers she found available for home gardeners in our area was 7-0-0 , although others , such as dried blood , may be available elsewhere with as much as 8 to 12 percent nitrogen . Too , if we seek to get off the top of the food chain ( eating more grains and fewer animal products ) as the food revolutionists also suggest , we wo n't even have much manure to use as organic fertilizer . Thus the semivegetarians and the organicists really are working contrary to each other without realizing it . What about the trace minerals said to be lacking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the mineral quality of the soil determines the mineral quality of the food . Even a frequent critic of organic food fetishes , Dr. Doris Calloway of the University of California , Berkeley , has said that trace minerals are more likely to be present in a natural fertilizer , noting that some ( selenium and chromium , for example ) even have been identified only relatively recently.146 But the Rodales may not have considered all the factors in arriving at their conclusions . Farmlands that are chemically fertilized almost always also have organic materials introduced by the plowing under of green crops and because soils intensively fertilized with commercial fertilizers leave more abundant residues and roots in the soil . A leading agricultural scientist , Dr. Firman Bear , pointed out that chemical fertilizers really are " the most fruitful means " of adding  | organic matter to the soils.147 Certainly this fact of life should calm some of the fears that chemical fertilizers eventually will make our soil " dead " and crops " nutritionless . " Moreover , chemical fertilizers can be ( and often are ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and particular crops . In one area , the soil may be deficient in phosphorus . In others , iron , manganese and zinc may be needed , usually due to their insolubility rather than to a small total amount in the soil . Newly-reclaimed acid peat and muck soils may require copper.148 But organic materials are harder to tailor to specific needs , in fact , are not dependable in what they do provide . The composition of manure may vary from one animal to another and even from the same animal at different times . Organicists often claim that chemical fertilizers inhibit the microbial content in the soil . But the Farm Journal reported that an Iowa State University agronomist , L. R. Frederick , applied inorganic fertilizers at the rate of 100,000 pounds per acre . Even at this deliberately excessive rate , the numbers and activity of soil microbes were seldom reduced . ' 49 Also , the fact that plants can be grown in liquid solutions with no soil at all ( hydroponics ) should calm fears that crops are not fully nutritious if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fruits have the same protein , carbohydrate , vitamin , and mineral content as the same strains growing in the ground with lots of manure . ' ' ' ' As dedicated an advocate of organic materials as Edward Faulkner , author of the famous Plowman 's Folly , recognized the role of chemical fertilizers . Organic advocates fear that soil becomes worn out through overuse . But , " with surprising suddenness it recovers , " Faulkner said . Moreover , " we would almost never find in the soil any organic solution entirely devoid of inorganic compounds . . . the water which assists in the decay of organic tissues already carries a load of inorganic compounds when it is absorbed into the organic material . " 151 People attracted to the idea of protecting the ecosystem may start an organic garden by working compost into the soil . For the first year or two they find they have a soggy mess , with poor drainage . So they resort to fertilizer to help out the " natural " - method during the five to seven years it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some types of organic materials , such as leaves , commercial nitrogen fertilizer must be added or else the organic matter , as it breaks down , will take up nitrogen from the soil . Organic advocates frequently argue that the same crops vary in their vitamin content in different areas . But the facts are that climatic differences and genetic characteristics are more influential than soil differences . In one of the early experiments at the U.S. Plant , Soil and Nutrition Laboratory , the quantity and intensity of sunlight falling on tomato fruit had much more influence on the concentration of vitamin C than any variation in the amount or type of nutrients applied to the plant , Kenneth C. Beeson , retired director of the laboratory , reported . High radiation meant high vitamin C but low iron ; high humidity produced high carotene ; high soil temperature resulted in high concentration of the B vitamins and minerals ; high organic matter produced high concentrations of carotene , thiamin , and iron but low riboflavin , magnesium , and sodium . Similarly , high rainfall increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported.152 Next to weather , a plant 's genetic makeup probably is the most important variable in nutritional value , points out Leonard D. Topoleski , associate professor at the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences . Some varieties of carrots , for example , contain more carotene than others " no matter what cultural method is used . " This expert on vegetable crops pointed out that nitrogen , phosphorus , and potassium are used in greater quantities than any of the other essential elements . These three elements usually are applied to the soil as inorganic fertilizer . As an example of the impracticality of supplying these elements in organic form , it would take ten tons of farm manure per acre , and one pound of bone meal per 100 square feet to provide the 140 pounds of nitrogen , 140 pounds of phosphorus , and 110 of potassium usually needed per acre to produce a satisfactory crop.153 Various experiments also have shown that organic fertilizers may be especially deficient in their ability to supply nutrients to plants early in the season during relatively cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extensive root system , and the microorganisms are not active in decomposing the fertilizer . ' S0  | Large grain farmers and grain experts have reported that a combination of chemical fertilizer and burying excess stubble is necessary for maximum production and high protein quality of grain . Without adequate fertilization , especially in sandy soils , " low proteins " appear , the Farm Journal has reported . ' ss Thus , while soil conditions apparently are not as vital as climatic and genetic characteristics in determining nutritional values in crops , certainly sometimes the nutritional advantage may be on the side of inorganic fertilizers . The angriest reaction to the refusal of the organic advocates to take into account all the scientific testimony has come from Norman E. Borlaug , famous wheat expert and Nobel prize winner . Borlaug accused organic advocates of clouding the basic problem in the use of chemical fertilizers . " They refuse , " he said , " to believe that the plant is unable to distinguish between nitrate , phosphate , or potassium or any essential element derived from the decomposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertilizer produced in a factory . " Heaping scorn on the environmentalists ' position , he said : " . . . organic gardeners using heavy applications of organic fertilizers but without using insecticides or fungicides , grow three beautiful tomato plants in their garden or patio and with this success claim they have found the solution to the world food production problem . " Borlaug 's resentment of city-dwelling " environmentalists " aside , his main concern was for " the underprivileged billions in the forgotten world . " For them , " . . . hunger has been a constant companion . " In Borlaug 's experience , the heavy and efficient use of chemical fertilizers is a vital part of the Green Revolution that is helping increase yields of wheat , rice , and other grains in the underdeveloped countries . Despite attempts of organic advocates to downgrade his views , Borlaug 's great contribution and experience in enlarging crop yields in hungry nations must be taken into account . He reported : If the high-yielding dwarf wheat and rice varieties were the catalysts that ignited the Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powered its forward thrust . The responsiveness of the high-yielding varieties has greatly increased fertilizer consumplion.156 What about the claims made by the Rodales and other organic  | advocates that an " overdose " of one nutrient from chemical fertilizer may block absorption of other nutrients ? Actually , soil nutrients can be unbalanced through the use of organic as well as with inorganic fertilizers , Warren Battle , soil scientist at Rutgers University , noted . In fact , most organic materials are unbalanced in themselves , and analysis is always needed . In extreme cases , chemical fertilizers can kill microorganisms . But usually this only happens when it 's done intentionally to suppress soil disease , microbiologist Richard Bartha advised . At Rutgers , too , soil scientists grew plants with organic and inorganic fertilizers ; then analyzed them for nutrients , vitamins , and so on , and could measure no differences.157 The example of imbalance that is often cited is the lack of iodine in the soils and waters of some areas , such as the Great Lakes and Pacific Northwest states . Allaway pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial control of goiter and cretinism is one of the great accomplishments of science achieved by adding inorganic iodine compounds to table salt . This progress could not have been accomplished organically unless organic fertilizers from seaweeds had been transported hundreds of miles to inland areas . ( Many health foodists , incidentally , oppose measures to encourage use of iodized salt , on the grounds that , like fluoridation of water , this is mass medication . To give Adelle Davis all possible credit , she has recommended that all salt be iodized . ) Sometimes there may be more dangers than benefits from organic materials if suitable caution in preparing composts and other safeguards are not observed . A number of warnings have been sounded about the dangers of transmitting salmonella infection , an intestinal disease , through organic materials . Some of these warnings were based on an incident in Holland , where salmonella was reported to be present in vegetables grown with the organic benefits of sewage effluent.158 I asked government microbiologists whether similar incidents had been reported in the U.S. R. B. Read , deputy director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , replied that he could not cite any data showing that organic gardening techniques may increase microbial hazard . But , he said , his own observations and some of the microbiological data from composting tend to support the possibility of greater dangers from crops from farms  | using manure and compost . " Before any definitive conclusions could be drawn , a great deal of study would have to be done , " Read advised . In general , the evidence is that both organic and chemical fertilizers are needed ; that organic fertilizers of themselves are not likely to improve the nutritional value or yield of crops but do enhance the effectiveness of inorganic fertilizers . Many nutritional experts have pointed out that if you got all your food from one small plot of land that was mineral-deficient , as a farm animal often does , you might possibly develop mineral deficiencies . But that chance is remote , since your food comes from all over . Against the evidence of actual experiments , the organic advocates often offer only sweeping statements , part truths , cursory and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even mystical explanations . Adelle Davis , for example , has made such generalizations as . . a family that can raise some or much of its food is far healthier than those that must depend on city markets . " She also tells about an anonymous school where all the vegetables and many of the fruits used are organically grown , the bread is made from stone-ground flour , etc. , and relates that she saw movies of the youngsters enjoying all sorts of activities including skiing , mountain climbing , " and playing football in the pouring rain . " She further refers to foods grown on soils built up " with natural minerals , composts , and mulches " as " vastly more delicious than the freshest produce forced with commercial fertilizers . " ' " You can , of course , visit any school where youngsters eat nonorganic foods and see similar activities , and if they do n't play football in pouring rain , that might even be evidence that nonorganic foods increase intelligence . The Rodale organization says flatly , " Organic foods have food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are grown in naturally balanced and fertilized soils . They have higher protein content , generally more minerals , trace elements , and vitamins . " There is no documentation of this blanket claim . As we have seen in the various experiments reported in this chapter , often there is no difference nutritionally between crops from organically or chemically fertilized soils . When there is , it is more likely to be  | on the side of the chemical or inorganic fertilizers . But if undocumented there is no lack of drama in Rodale claims : Organically fertilized soils , this organization declares , " are not subjected to strong synthetic fertilizers that wring the last bit of life from the soil , that spell death to essential microorganisms and earthworms , and that lead ultimately to worn-out land , erosion , dust storms and foodless foods . " ' 160 This , of course , is a half truth , or a mixture of fact and fancy , especially the threat of " foodless foods . " It is true that many soils throughout the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic matter following too much cultivation , observed L. H. Mac Daniels , emeritus professor at the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences . With the loss of organic matter , water-holding capacity and penetration is reduced , resulting in runoff and erosion . But it is only half true that using composted materials without also using chemical fertilizers is adequate to build up the organic matter in soils over large areas or to solve the problems of crop nutrition , Mac Daniels points out . Obviously it is impossible to accumulate enough compost materials to increase the organic matter in the soil adequately . On the other hand , as we have seen , chemical fertilizers immediately increase plant growth with the results that more organic matter is returned to the soil , especially when cover crops are used.161 Adelle Davis 's generalization that organically grown foods are healthier , and the frequent claims of organic advocates that such foods prevent disease , is not borne out by fact . In all the developed countries , chemical fertilizers are used extensively . Those countries where the per-acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life expectancy than those where fertilizer use is low . ' 62 Such use of fertilizers quite apparently makes possible a greater amount and variety of foods . A simple correlation between use of fertilizer and life expectancy is not possible since standards of sanitation , medical care , and so on , must be taken into account . Still , the use of chemical fertilizers obviously has not reduced life expectancy . When organic advocates do concede that soils may need additional fertilizers besides such organic materials as compost , they  | then urge the use of natural minerals and soil conditioners . Tests were made of one leading " Natural Organic Fertilizer " by the Cooperative Extension Service at South Dakota State University College of Agriculture . Dealers selling the so-called organic fertilizer claimed that it had an analysis of 6-2-1 ( 6 percent nitrogen , 2 percent phosphate , 1 percent potash ) . The research team , directed by Fred Shubeck of the college staff , used the organic conditioner on corn and oat fields at the recommended rate of 200 pounds per acre . The average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural organic fertilizer was 15 bushels less for oats and 14 bushels less for corn than from the equivalent investments in conventional commercial fertilizer . Moreover ? and of special interest to people who believe organically grown foods are more nutritious ? the crude protein in the corn grain grown with the organic fertilizer was 1.4 percent lower on average than that from the conventionally fertilized crop , Earl P. Adams , extension agronomist , told me . The levels of those nutrients analyzed were lower for the organically grown crops in every case except sulfur . The nutrients analyzed included protein and a number of minerals important in diets such as iron , calcium and magnesium . Organic gardeners often use as their ultimate argument the fact that they produce fine-tasting tomatoes or enough cucumbers to feed the whole neighborhood . This is a child's-eye view of the nation 's food needs . Our real subsistence comes mainly from the big midwest farms that produce the basic grains . These grains provide the bread , much of the meat , poultry , eggs , milk , and other basic foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 287 million harvested acres of crops including 168 million in the north central states . The superior flavor often attributed to organically grown produce is , from all the expert testimony , really due to the fact that these fruits and vegetables are allowed to vine or tree-ripen , are harvested at the peak of quality , and used promptly . The same advantages would occur in these circumstances even if chemical fertilizer were used despite the claim by Rodale Press that " Organic foods taste better ? taste as they were meant to . They 're natural foods , not foods grown and processed in an attempt to circumvent or outwit nature . " Scientifically , of course , this is mere sales propaganda . If man  | had not been able to improve upon if not actually fool mother nature we would not be here today . It is not even true that all foods picked at the peak of best-tasting ripeness are nutritionally superior . Some are . Others may not be . Tomatoes picked when still slightly immature may have a higher vitamin C concentration than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , flavor seems to be in the eye of the beholder . Florence Fisher , who assisted with the research for this book , happened to be in a store where two women were murmuring with delight over the taste of some organically grown fruit . They stuffed some in her mouth and demanded to know if it was n't delicious . She could not tell the difference but agreed it was . Although there are no significant nutritional , health , or taste advantages , there are , of course , sound ecological reasons for returning organic materials to the soil where possible . Many home gardeners maintain compost heaps to dispose of leaves and garden refuse while eventually making humus to add to soil . Large-scale composting on a community-wide basis offers some hope as a partial alternative to traditional waste disposal methods . While paying a lot more for organic foods will hardly solve the waste problem , many experiments now going forward can make progress toward this end . These range from modest attempts by local municipalities to compost leaves instead of using them for landfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities to convert sewage into organic fertilizer . For many years Milwaukee has dried its sludge and sold it as " Milorganite " fertilizer . Some of these efforts even have saved communities expenses in trucking leaves to dumps . Others , involving converting sewage to fertilizer , sometimes have proved costly and were abandoned . Disposal of organic wastes is an enormous problem in farming areas too . Like the garbage and sewage of the cities , farm wastes contribute to water pollution . The farm-level organic wastes are mainly animal manure and bedding , dead animals , and leaves , stalks , stubble , and culls from crops . Similar waste-disposal problems also occur at food-processing plants . ' 64 There are many efforts , even though fragmented , to recycle these farm and plant wastes . As one example , the New Jersey Agriculture Station at Rutgers University with USDA help is experimenting with composting swine waste with garbage solids . Some  | poultry-processing plants collect blood and other residues to convert into poultry rations . Sophisticated methods of decomposing manures for use as fertilizers are also being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil rather than burning it , Keith Barrons , an industry agricultural scientist , notes . Another valid concern in relation to fertilizers is the runoff of nitrates and phosphates to surrounding streams and lakes . In Suffolk County , New York , authorities are considering restricting commercial fertilizers used for lawns and crops because of the effect on ground water . As well as the danger to infants , William Morton of the University of Oregon Medical School warns of increased risk of high blood pressure from high nitrate levels in drinking water . He told the American Chemical Society that Selective Service and other data from Oregon and Colorado showed an increase in certain locations , which could be correlated with increased organic nitrate levels in municipal water supplies . ' 65 While commercial fertilizers are usually indicted for increased nitrates , Morton 's report also implicated organic materials . As noted in chapter 10 , heavy fertilization with natural fertilizers has resulted in high nitrate content of soils and plants , especially if there is a rapid breakdown of soil organic matter and/or heavy applications of animal manures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables such as several varieties of beets , radishes , and lettuce grown in highly fertilized soil have even more nitrate than the much-criticized limits set by FDA for use in cured meat products discussed in chapter 10. ' 66 The use of organic matter also does help to prevent leaching of nitrate from the soil , Barry Commoner pointed out . This happens because , with reduced humus content , " roots do not efficiently absorb the added fertilizer . " 167 Encouraging and educating farmers to use grass terraces and settling basins will also help trap topsoil and fertilizers that otherwise may run off into streams , with pollution damage to these waters and economic loss of their fertilizer soil to the farmers . Certainly it seems unnecessary to throw out the baby with the polluted water by fighting the efficient and controlled use of chemical fertilizers in conjunction with organic materials .  | PESTICIDES AND PROBLEMS THE THIRD MAJOR CONTROVERSY , along with those over additives and fertilizers , has raged over the use of pesticides and herbicides , or " poison sprays " as health food advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods contaminated by DDT and other pesticides may well be the most significant reason why many people have turned to health food stores . It is not unusual to see young women come in and buy large sacks of carrots as their main purchase . ( Carrots have become a special concern . ) The effort to limit or even ban chemical pesticides and herbicides has drawn support far beyond the health food group . Such influential ecological and environmental organizations as the National Audubon Society , Sierra Club , Environmental Defense Fund , and others took up the crusade launched by Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring . But of special concern to worried eaters she wrote : We must not only be concerned with what is happening to the soil , we must wonder to what extent insecticides are absorbed from contaminated soils and introduced into plant tissues . Much depends on the type of soil , the crop , and the nature and concentration of the insecticide . Soil high in organic matter releases smaller quantities of poisons than others . Carrots absorb more insecticide than any other crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal use of the killer image set the stage for the bitterness of the controversy over chemical pesticides and herbicides . Referring to the use of arsenic in pesticide dusts ,  | she wrote , " . . . it has been a favorite agent of homicide from long before the time of the Borgias to the present . " 169 Users of such long-lasting pesticides as DDT helped tie the noose of government control around their own neck by such heedless practices as spraying or dusting large areas by air . As a result the use of DDT , which already had been dwindling during the previous ten years , has been banned completely for most uses after January 1 , 1973 . A revealing example related by Ruth Harmer involved the 1969 courtroom proceedings in California at which the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee sought access to pesticide spraying records . Workers charged that they were being sent into sprayed fields before the legal waiting period had elapsed and sometimes fields were sprayed while they were working with crops . In rebuttal , the crop-dusting industry marshalled an array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their crop-dusting records were " trade secrets . " State agricultural officials sided with industry ; state health officials , with the farm workers ; university scientists with both . Finally the state agriculture department did prohibit 91 pesticides for use on farm crops and issued new restrictions on 120 others.10 The record of misuse of DDT was so blatant that the agricultural chemical industries yielded to the ban with relatively little opposition . Most of the larger manufacturers already had given up production of DDT by 1971 anyway and the main remaining use had been in cotton farming . . The most stubborn opposition to any ban on DDT came , revealingly enough , from the World Health Organization , the U.N . Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) , and Norman Borlaug , noted plant geneticist who developed the high-yield grains described in chapter 11 . In his much-discussed 1971 speech to the FAO , Borlaug made the sweeping claim that no chemical " has ever done as much as DDT to improve the health , economic and social benefits of the people of the developing nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the successful worldwide campaign against malaria launched in 1955 by the World Health Organization . He deplored the success of the attacks on DDT which saw a decline in U.S. use from 79 million pounds in 1959 to 12 million pounds in 1970 . Borlaug argued that if the use of DDT and other pesticides were to be completely banned , crop losses  | would probably rise 50 percent and food prices would increase drastically . The health organization 's concern over possible loss of one of their most effective disease-control weapons is understandable . In their concern for wildlife and purity of foods some of the environmentalists and organic advocates seemed to overlook these valid humanitarian concerns . One writer even attacked the World Health Organization as having " a vested interest in pesticides because of public health programs . " This is hardly a " vested interest " but an overriding public interest . There are bigger issues at stake than wormy apples . ( Even housewives who call in exterminators have been accused of being so indoctrinated that they have developed pest hallucinations and seek to rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might , I have never been able to render any insect infestation invisible , nor convince my wife that she is suffering from an hallucination . ) While Borlaug 's fears of reduced crops and sharp price rises may have been exaggerated , since DDT has been used less and less since 1964 for food crops , without doubt costs will rise if effective insecticides are not available on at least a limited and controlled basis . DDT has not , of course , been the only pesticide under attack . As this is written in late 1972 , the Environmental Defense Fund , a citizens ' organization which had successfully sought the elimination of DDT , was also seeking to compel the Environmental Protection Agency to ban remaining uses of aldrin and dieldrin . These are chlorinated hydrocarbons chemically related to DDT . Aldrin is used primarily against corn pests . Dieldrin , with many insecticide uses , is a weapon against termites . Another insecticide , malathion , an organophosphate now widely used as a substitute for DDT in mosquito control , has been charged with causing deformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down quickly in the soil . Sevin , used against gypsy moths , is suspected to have a birth-defect potential . The use of lindane for both agricultural and home use has also been criticized . For the purposes of evaluating the fears about contamination of foods , it is necessary to separate the impact of pesticides on wildlife from the possible harmful effect on foods . Even the effect on wildlife of the chemical insecticides , including DDT , is not en-  | tirely clear cut . In some instances , as in the 1970 deaths of sea lions on the Pacific Coast and of some Florida alligators and fish in 1971 , high levels of DDT were found in the carcasses . But subsequent investigations indicated that contagious infections may have been at least the primary cause . Still there is no doubt that DDT , dieldrin , and other persistent pesticides do move into the food chain and accumulate in the bodies of various animal species , birds , and fish . Nor do you have to be a wildlife lover to become anxious about insecticides accumulating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to demand that no chemicals of any kind be used . Or they try to avoid them by paying high prices for organic produce claimed to be free of pesticide residues . However , by 1972 the residues appeared to be under better control . First of all , federal and some state laws set limits for the residual amounts of pesticides or herbicides in foods . These are usually set on the basis of what the World Health Organization and the U.N . Food and Agriculture Organization consider to be acceptable daily intake levels . Then these levels are monitored by the FDA by analyzing market baskets of foods ( about eighty items ) collected in twenty-eight cities . During the late 1960s , DDT was the chlorinated residue found most frequently . It was detected in all diet samples and all classes of foods . Breakdown products of DDT were the next most frequent residues . In general DDT accounted for about one-third of the total dietary intake of chlorinated residues . The ban on DDT effective in 1973 thus is an important reassurance that a major cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban , monitoring results showed that " daily intake of DDT analogs declined significantly . " ' 7 ' The decline has been especially sharp in such midwest localities as Kansas City , which previously had unusually high residues , but has occurred in almost all areas , even those with previously relatively low levels such as Baltimore . Next to DDT , residues of dieldrin , lindane , and heptachlor epoxide usually have followed DDT and its analogs in frequency of occurrence . Herbicide levels have been relatively rare and low .  | Residues of aldrin and dieldrin were those usually the highest in level to the maximum that the government has considered to be acceptable , although still below the accepted level . Moreover , the government monitors reported in 1972 that unlike the decline in DDT " there is no significant change from year to year in the intake of aldrin and dieldrin. " 12 Thus , the Environmental Defense Fund appeared to be justified in raising the question about the need for a review of continuing uses of aldrin and dieldrin . The EDF , Conservation Fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to reduce the residue problem than the entire health food industry put together , and this regulatory approach is the real need . The futility of depending on foods sold as natural or organic was further demonstrated in a comment by a representative of a large health food and vitamin manufacturer whom I had approached as a potential jobber . He volunteered that the word " organic " is misleading in relation to pesticides " There might be a blight and the organic ' crops might have to be sprayed . " In fact , the New York State Agriculture and Markets Department found that of fifty-five products sold as organic , which it had tested , 30 percent showed pesticide residues compared to a usual rate of 20 percent among ordinary foods . At 1972 hearings conducted by State Attorney General Louis Lefkowitz , Food Laboratories Director Elmer George testified that , for example , an " absolutely guaranteed organic " macaroni contained 0.19 parts per million ( ppm ) of a phosphor-related compound ; a " 100 percent organic imported orange-flower tea " had 4 ppm of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereal had 0.21 ppm malathion residue.13 These examples were as high and sometimes higher than those found nationally on ordinary foods . For example , the maximum values found in the June 1969-April 1970 period for grain and cereal products were 0.077 ppm for DDT ; 0.014 for dieldrin , and 0.096 for malathion.14 These levels , however , are not considered harmful . It also should be noted for the record that Mark Schwartz , science adviser for Rodale Press , rebutted these findings , claiming the California laboratory his firm uses found that organic foods had 30 percent lower pesticide levels than ordinary foods , Grace Lichtenstein reported . ' "  | Whether the residues in foods sold as organic occur through deliberate use to protect against blight or because they are " in the air and soil , " as organicists tend to say , they are there . Certainly it would be especially difficult for the health food industry to control pesticides on imported ingredients and products . Carrots , as noted , are a frequent worry to people concerned about residues . For example , leaflets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that carrots absorbed more insecticides than the other vegetables analyzed . But my own examination of the monitoring reports for 1968-70 shows that root vegetables , which include carrots , in general were lowest in total chlorinated organic pesticides and DDT and its analogs . The danger of the accumulation has long been recognized by both federal and state governments , Kenneth Walker , a USDA specialist in insecticide problems , told me . The label on insecticide warns , " Do Not Use in Soil Expected to Be Used for Root Vegetables in the Next Two Years . " The problem is that carrots contain oil , and most of the agricultural pesticides used are soluble in oil . ( Since the bulk of the residue is in and immediately under the skin , peeling or scraping the carrot will remove most of any possible residue . ) Any residue on potatoes is in the skin . For that reason , the registration of dieldrin and aldrin was canceled for potatoes and most root crops . While there have been mistakes and some growers have deliberately breached the warnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restriction has been observed , Walker maintained . If not , the penalties are costly . The FDA may seize the commodities , and there have even been some jail sentences . While some organic advocates maintain that the permitted residues are still higher than is safe , Walker considered them to be low ? only one part per million in some cases . The Agriculture Department , which obviously represents the interests of farmers and farm-related industries , does not , however , control the residue tolerances . They are established by the Environmental Protection Agency and monitored by the FDA . Meat really is the largest source of pesticide residues in our foods , with dairy products second . Meat residues are below permitted tolerances , and they tend to be concentrated in the fat .  | Trimming fat removes some of the residues and cooking removes still more . One study of pork loins at Michigan State University found that cooked samples showed lower levels of dieldrin residues than uncooked , and that residues were present in the cooking juices.16 Similarly , consumers concerned about residues may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other sausage meats ( in addition to the added nitrites ) . Roasting and broiling did tend to remove somewhat more of the cooking drippings than braising and microwave cooking , although the pattern was not consistent . An often-voiced fear is that chlorinated hydrocarbons such as DDT accumulate in body fat . One anxiety is that under conditions of stress or in case of sudden weight loss , the DDT stored in the fat is released into the blood . Some of the so-called orthodox doctors , or " establishment " doctors if you really want to put them down , have conceded this fact but have said that symptoms of toxicity have occurred only in cases of large , sudden weight loss . Vivian Schulte , a medical college adjunct professor of nutrition , testified at the New York City health food hearings that there is no completely cumulative effect of chemicals in the body : " You do n't go on storing indefinitely , you gain a little and you lose a little . " Thomas Jukes , of the Donner Laboratory of the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is stored in the fat but is steadily broken down and excreted in the urine . If the daily intake goes down , the level in the fat goes down . The average amount of DDT in the fat of the general American public has dropped in recent years as the amount of DDT used in agriculture was reduced . Above 16 milligrams per kilogram a day , poisoning symptoms may develop . In 1953-4 , the general dosage of the population of the U.S. was .0025 milligrams , and the 1970 dosage was .0004. ' 77 This is a reduction of 80 percent . The issue of benefits vs. risks has come up in every argument over agricultural chemicals and additives , but especially in relation to pesticides and herbicides . There is no question that the benefits of these chemicals are more certain than those of many of the additives discussed in chapter 10 . But the risks also seem greater . The answer would seem to be in the selective , controlled use of the safest possible insecticides . An example of the food supply problems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of chemicals was pointed out by Arleen Arnold , Detroit District Extension Information Agent : " In 1972 bad weather throughout the country has had an adverse effect on fruits and vegetables generally . It would have been complete disaster if we had had crops ravaged by insects and diseases plus bad weather . " Gordon Ropp , director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture , estimated that even now pests cause losses of about $20 billion a year in plants and livestock the equivalent of 75 million acres of food , or one-fourth the harvested crop acres.178 Even in mosquito control , a matter of controversy in 1972 because of an increase in their numbers in some areas after sprayings were discontinued , it is possible to continue to use insecticides selectively and with minimum threat to bird and aquatic life . Otherwise malaria may again become a problem in this country . While aerial spraying has been discontinued , intertidal zones where mosquitoes lay eggs are still being treated . ( DDT , of course , has been strongly implicated in the thinning of bird eggshells . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this effect . Measurements of older shells in museums demonstrated their greater thickness . ) For suburban and rural dwellers , the gypsy moth represents a real concern . The caterpillars defoliated almost a million and a half acres of woodland in nine northeastern states alone in the summer of 1972 , the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service reported . In the Newark , New Jersey , watershed , more than a million trees were killed as the direct result of a three-year infestation . USDA scientists have become especially concerned about the damage that may be done to the huge Appalachian , Ozark Mountain southern oak-pine forests . Connecticut residents were thrown into a near panic when the leaf-eating caterpillars and other pests defoliated over half a million acres . But it is revealing to note that more Connecticut families were worried about the effects of spray than about the caterpillars . Of fifty towns that voted on whether or not to spray , thirty-two voted no , Joan Lee Faust , New York Times garden editor , reported . In the face of such real-life problems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives suggested such as mulching to keep down weeds , removing bugs by hand , and putting out saucers of beer to attract slugs , may work for a small home gar-  | den but obviously are not feasible for large-scale farming . To provide the beer to catch the slugs , grains must be grown , which puts the organic gardeners right back at the top of the food chain . They would serve the ecology better by eating the grains , or at least drinking the beer . Ducks sometimes are used to get rid of snails . At the same time they fertilize . For home gardeners , if not for large farmers , various plants and herbs that repel specific insects sometimes are suggested . These include garlic , marigolds , basil , thyme , and painted daisy ( pyrethrum ) . In fact , pyrethrum and rotenone are insecticides from natural plant sources , which are also used in larger-scale farming . For home gardeners , the Hanover , New llampshire , co-op noted , " symbiotic or companion planting " is thought to discourage pests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peas repel aphids ; tomatoes planted with asparagus repel asparagus beetle , and beans placed with or near potatoes discourage Mexican bean beetles and Colorado potato beetles . Some organic gardeners have expressed desperation over trying to control bugs . " I have tried every suggestion . . . to eliminate these potato bugs , " a harassed reader wrote to Organic Gardening and Farming . She even " hand-picked bugs by the hour , all to no avail . " 19 One of the most controversial and almost mystical claims of organic advocates is that " plants grown on rich organic soil , without use of chemical fertilizers , and without being sprayed , will not he attacked by insects because insects wo n't like their taste , " said Robert Rodale , the now head organic gardener . He wrote : Down through the decades , organic gardeners and farmers have made that claim because they saw with their own eyes that their plants often enjoyed an almost mysterious immunity to insect attack . Rodale also pointed to the reduction of insect damage reported by gardeners who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kodak ! tries to prove this contention by citing professors who speculated that ( 1 ) pesticides actually make plants taste better to insects , and/or ( 2 ) insects are attracted to the purportedly nutritionally inferior or imbalanced chemically fertilized plants . The explanation advanced for this unusual theory is that , unlike man  | and the higher mammals , insects may " thrive and reproduce better on unbalanced or inferior diets as we think of them . " 18 ? The claim that the presence of organic materials will control plant disease and insect pests is a " half truth , " horticulturist L. H. Mac Daniels charged . Under some conditions crops growing rapidly as the result of adequate fertilization , either organic or inorganic , appear to be less subject to insect and disease damage . Often this is apparent rather than real ; the larger amount of foliage on the healthier plant tends to hide some of the insect damage . But with many diseases , the opposite is true ; a plant growing rapidly with adequate nitrogen supply is likely to be more susceptible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly bulbs , tubers , and roots , are more likely to be damaged in soils high in organic matter.181 While the taste-test and faith theories of repelling insects are more mythical than magical , alternatives such as the use of " natural enemies " and other biological methods do have potential usefulness in integrated programs . No less a respected but nonestablishment scientist as Eugene Rabinowitch wrote in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists : The answer to dangers raised by the unthinking , massive use of chemical insecticides lies not in prohibiting their use . ( Most American state governments were forced to do so by overenthusiastic conservationists . ) It does not lie in depending on mysterious " natural " forces which , according to some , protect members of " natural " ecological systems from destruction by biological enemies . It can be found only in rational limitation of the use of presently known insecticides and their gradual replacement by less dangerous ones , and in the development of biological control methods , such as introduction of predators feeding on the noxious insects , interference with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ males by irradiation or chemical treatment ) and other such procedures . ' 82 Actually more work has been done to try to develop biological controls than many may realize . But biological controls at best are still haphazard , at worst are almost as unpleasant as the target pests . Sometimes they are futile , like the electronic black light trap sold to homeowners , which my wife observed also attracted insects from neighbors ' homes . Furthermore , Kenneth Walker noted , the mechanical traps , yellow lights , and similar devices often are indiscriminate . They eliminate not only destructive but beneficial insects . Eventually  | effective traps may be developed . So far they do not exist . The so-called natural method of controlling insects through predators or parasites definitely can contribute to control but also poses problems . One is that the predators are always a day or two late . As the graphed curve on pest population rises , so does the parasite curve but it always trails , Walker noted . Now the Agriculture Department is trying to develop methods of anticipating the movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , the green peach aphid overwinters on peach trees . Then it goes to alfalfa fields and eventually to sugar beets . It carries disease into the sugar beets . The department has developed small portable greenhouses to set in the alfalfa fields . These build up millions of parasites , which can be released to take care of the pests . Another problem is that many of the-pests are not indigenous to this country . So if you look for a parasite for the European corn borer , you have to look for it in Europe , Walker pointed out . Then again , the parasites of the European corn borer may work well in Iowa but not in Nebraska because of differences in the climate . Use of predators and parasites is an expensive program . Farmers can not turn such control programs on and off like a light switch . They may generate millions of the parasites every day and not use them just to have them for the day they are needed . Aphids develop in some crops overnight . However , all biological controls now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insect population to manageable proportions . Furthermore , such integrated controls ( chemicals plus biological ) require large areas ; for example , about 20,000 square miles to control pests on cotton . Since sprays move , one farmer using integrated controls can be defeated by a farmer who sprays , Walker pointed out . Over the past 80 years some 520 species and predators of about 80 pests have been imported . But only 115 have become established and only some 20 have provided important control of some of our worst pests , Herbert Kastl , Long Island , New York , extension pest-control specialist , reported . Introduction of beneficial insects has proved effective against several types of scale insects , alfalfa weevil , and other pests , and has even provided selective control of some noxious weeds . ' " The sterile male is another useful means of controlling insects ,  | but again , in combination with chemicals . The classic example of this technique was the eradication of the screwworm in the southeast . Scientists working to develop sex attractants and mass trapping of male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , is probably limited to relatively low populations of the moths . ' 84 Microbial insecticides are another alternative to indiscriminate synthetic chemicals with their tendency to destroy beneficial insects . The microbial insecticides are pathogens such as bacteria and viruses , which attack specific larvae and insects.185 Some such products are already available to farmers and have the added advantage of effectiveness against insects that have become resistant to chemical insecticides . There is no residue problem and no toxicity for natural predators , birds , or animals . There are , however , only limited applications so far , and cost problems . Plant-breeding to provide genetic resistance to many diseases also helps to reduce reliance on chemicals . Among insect-resistant varieties that already have been developed are strains of wheat that resist the Hessian fly , and an alfalfa that resists the spotted alfalfa aphid . Research to develop resistant varieties of vegetables has been accelerated . Breeding resistant crops takes many years from fifteen to twenty in the case of the wheat varieties resistant to the Hessian fly . But a number of vegetable varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available , including varieties of tomatoes , cucumbers , melons , snap beans , spinach , strawberries , and others . In general , progress is being made toward correcting the misuse of chemical pesticides with its harmful effects on the environment , and toxic residues in food . The present trend is to stricter and limited use with some chemicals available only to professional applicators who can be regulated more readily and are skilled in application techniques . At the same time the developing biological controls will become an increasing part of integrated pest-control programs . But if the public really wants protection against heavy use of chemical pesticides it must expect to pay the bill for the necessary regulation and research . Right now Americans are spending much more on health foods than on such research .  | Another aspect of commercial produce that organic advocates have criticized , and that has worried many other consumers , is the wax used to coat apples , cucumbers and other products . Ruth Leverton advises that this film is a water emulsion of waxes in formulations approved by the FDA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients may be carnauba ( derived from the leaves of the carnauba tree ) , mineral oil , or oleic acid ( an unsaturated fatty acid ) . These are harmless . But in any case fruits and vegetables usually are washed before eating or , as in the case of cucumbers , peeled . It should be understood that much produce such as apples has a natural wax exudation . The fruit is washed before marketing to remove this rather soft natural wax which traps dirt and bacteria . The replacement wax is a little harder , Arleen Arnold , Michigan extension agent , points out .
