The sirens began to wail while all Israel was observing Yom Kippur , the holiest and also the quietest day of the Jewish year . By tradition , tens of thousands of servicemen were home on leave ; Israeli Broadcasting had shut down for the day ; and just about the only vehicles on the highways were ambulances . <P> As crowds of worshipers emerged from synagogues at the end of the five-hour-long morning services of atonement , they found the streets filled with speeding trucks , buses and Jeeps . The Israeli radio was back on the air . All afternoon its broadcasts of news bulletins and classical music were interrupted by such incongruous phrases as " meat pie , " " sea wolf " and " wool string " - military codes calling reservists to duty . By late afternoon , virtually every Israeli-and much of the rest of the world as well-knew that what Defense Minister Moshe Dayan defiantly called " all-out war " had begun again . <P> Blue Point . The fighting erupted when Egyptian troops surged across the Suez Canal and Syrian soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces swept through Israel 's front lines and punched their way into Israeli-held territory under the glare of an afternoon sun . Backed by heavy artillery and strafing jets , they maneuvered with tanks and armored vehicles . Helicopters carried some Arab troops into battle . United Nations observers reported seeing Egyptians crossing into the Sinai Desert at five points along the 103-mile canal front ; Syrian troops were spotted moving into Israel over the central section of the Golan Heights cease-fire line by other U.N . teams . The Syrians were soon stopped , but the Egyptians claimed that within hours they occupied nearly all of the east bank of the canal-a claim quickly denied by the Israelis . Though both Egypt and Syria insisted that invading Israeli troops had started the war , the evidence clearly indicated that the fourth Arab-Israeli war in 25 years had been launched by a massive Arab invasion . Within 24 hours , Israeli troops had stemmed the Arab thrust and were delivering a brutal counterattack . <P> News of the invasion sent Israeli civilians cleaning out their bomb shelters , filling their bathtubs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several synagogues , services were interrupted as the sextons stood up and called out the names of young men who were being summoned to duty ; other worshipers , on hearing the news , quickly folded their prayer shawls and buzzed Israel 's principal cities , perhaps as a signal for air force call-ups ; but it was a curious occurrence , because planes had never flown over Israel during Yom Kippur before .
