Communist troops were at Saigon 's gate last April and shells were exploding everywhere , but a small band of doctors continued to treat patients at battered Gia Dinh Hospital . During a recent lull in Lebanon 's civil war , a medical team entered Beirut and set up an emergency clinic in an isolated Moslem enclave which had been blockaded for nine months . In Guatemala last February , the ground was still trembling when a special task force of doctors arrived to care for victims of that country 's disastrous earthquake . <P> These courageous doctors were all volunteers and members of an extraordinary Paris-based medical organization called Mdecins Sans Frontires-literally , doctors without borders . Created in 1971 by a handful of idealistic young French physicians who had served as volunteers in Biafra during the Nigerian civil war , M.S.F. membership has since grown to nearly 750 physicians and paramedics of more than a dozen nationalities , including Americans . Their basic credo : to offer medicine 's healing hand to any part of the world where it may suddenly be needed . <P> Operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Gare de Lyon railroad station , M.S.F. has sent medical teams flying off to the most remote corners of the world . Almost as soon as it gets word of a medical emergency , M.S.F. responds . A duty officer at the cramped headquarters scans his file cards and quickly puts together an appropriate team that usually consists of a doctor , a surgeon and an anaesthetist , as well as nurses or paramedics . By telephone or telegraph , the volunteers are found wherever they happen to be in the world ; travel and expense money to the site of the mission is provided by relief agencies , airlines or private donors . Special equipment , including surgical tools , resuscitation apparatus , vaccines and about 30 basic drugs-often contributed by pharmaceutical manufacturers-are packaged in advance and ready to go . <P> M.S.F. doctors are not paid unless they stay for more than three months ( after which they usually get only about $100 a week ) , and receive no personal publicity ; they are bound to the organization 's code of anonymity . Nonetheless , leaving their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same doctors have responded repeatedly in crises . <P> Ironclad Rule . The teams live and eat with their patients , and often have to rough it in hostile terrain . When Peru 's mountain dwellers showed reluctance to come to M.S.F. 's field hospitals after the 1974 quake , the doctors climbed the Andes by mule and horseback to reach the injured . By ironclad rule , they are scrupulously nonpartisan ; no nation has ever rejected them for political reasons . In the Viet Nam , October and Angolan wars , M.S.F. offered help to all ; the doctors themselves have so far sustained no casualties . They are also unfazed by the unexpected ; after Nicaragua 's 1972 quake , they found that their first duty was obstetrical : the tremors had induced premature labor in countless pregnant women .
