She sprawls-giggling and gangly-in a Waldorf-Astoria suite , looking as out of place as a cheerleader at a debutante ball . Her shaggy haircut springs out from her head . Her nails are bitten to the quick , her black boot heels are run over . She sprays words and sounds . She is having a frantic kind of fun , like a kid rolling down a hill , dizzy and excited at the same time . But who cares ? Certainly not Liza Minnelli . <P> She has wound up a successful engagement at the Waldorf 's Empire Room , a knockout , nonstop show that had everybody-including Liza-gasping for breath . She opens at Puerto Rico 's El San Juan Hotel this week . She has just been nominated for an Academy Award for her first starring role in The Sterile Cuckoo . She will soon be seen in the title role in Otto Preminger 's Tell Me That You Love Me , Junie Moon , in which she has to be convincing as a facially scarred girl in love . And in the talk stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> TIME Contributing Editor Katie Kelly reports how Liza feels about it all : <P> Liza folds her mouth around those sugar-lump teeth and winds up into a giggle that moves from the top of her head right straight down to her toes . " Yeah-I 'm happy , " she says , the big smile looped securely in place . " But then , if I 'm feeling anything , I figure-WHEW ! -I 'm here ! I exist ! I am ! " <P> This from the kid who gave her first public performance at age seven on the stage of the Palace . She remembers . " My mother called me up on the stage and I danced while she sang Swanee . " There are worse ways to start . " I thought it was terrific-just terrific-to be able to kick up your legs that way . I remember hearing the waves and waves of applause washing over us . I also remember wondering whether my pants showed while I was dancing . " <P> In the Night . It was a childhood to be reckoned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , " says Liza , by this time lying on the floor alternately bumming cigarettes and hugging her dog , Ocho . " We started moving around a lot from one house to another . Usually we moved in the night . That was probably because Mama was so broke and maybe she owed money to landlords . Anyway , every time we moved I 'd find myself in a different school . Private if we could afford it , public if we could n't . " As a result , " I hated school . It annoyed me . Oh , I went through the whole bit when I was nine-you know , wanting to be a teacher and all that . I used to line my dolls up and give lectures . Hah ! But that passed . "
