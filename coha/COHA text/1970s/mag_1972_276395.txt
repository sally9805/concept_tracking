Dancer Isadora Duncan died as dramatically as she lived , when her long scarf became caught in the wheel of a moving car and strangled her . A one-in-a-million fluke ? Not quite . Flowing neckwear has been in style recently , and according to an article in the A.M.A. Journal , so have freakish-and often fatal-injuries . In one of eleven cases studied , a teen-age girl suffered severe facial cuts and bruises when her scarf snagged in the wheel of her boy friend 's motorcycle . An eleven-year-old boy whose scarf caught in the engine of his snowmobile was saved only by prompt mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . Other victims of the Isadora syndrome were even less fortunate . Five of the eleven victims died , but none as gruesomely as a young mother who wore a long scarf on a ski lift . Riding to the top of a mountain , she was yanked from her seat and hanged when her scarf caught on a descending chair .                    @
