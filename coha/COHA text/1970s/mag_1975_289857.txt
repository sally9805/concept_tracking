When Tanzanian Miler Filbert Bayi first appeared in international meets three years ago , other runners viewed his style with disdain . Instead of pacing himself and saving a kick for the last quarter-mile , Bayi sprinted from the gun . His opponents , recalls Hurdler Tom Hill , " used to sit back at their old pace and say , ' Wow , this fool is going to drop dead on the third lap . ' " Trouble was , Bayi never did . He began to make a habit of leaving astonished stars behind him . Last year at the Commonwealth Games in New Zealand , Bayi atomized Jim Ryun 's seven-year-old 1,500-meter world record with a time of 3:32.2-equivalent to a 3:49.2 mile . This winter , in his debut on the U.S. indoor circuit , he has kept up the pressure . Although the smaller indoor ovals have forced him to run more cautiously , Bayi has swept all his races , including last week 's AAU championships in New York City . <P> Bayi is not the first East African to run into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold medal in the 1968 Olympics , Fellow Countryman Ben Jipcho is history 's second fastest miler , and Ugandan John Akii-bua holds the world record in the 400-meter hurdles . Now a veritable army of runners from East Africa is readying for the Montreal Olympics next year . <P> Bayi is the prototype . A streamlined 5 ft. 9 in. , 135 Ibs. , he glides along with the grace of a gazelle and the stamina of a steer . Unlike most long-distance runners , whose faces are studies in agony after the first lap , Bayi , 21 , almost looks as if he is out for a leisurely Sunday lope ; occasionally , he can be seen smiling faintly when his lead turns insurmountable . His only concessions to strain are frequent glances over his shoulder to see if anyone has kept up . <P> For other milers , his speed can be frightening . Outdoors , where he does not have to trim his pace , Bayi regularly runs the first half-mile in the low 1:50s . When Ryun broke the world record , he made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bayi has changed the entire strategy of the mile . " We have to get up and go from the start now , " says New Zealander Rod Dixon , who placed third in the 1,500 meters in Munich . Says Bayi modestly : " It 's just my style . I 'm not trying to psych anyone . " Except himself . Last year , when he tried running with the pack , he was so rattled by the traffic that he fell and was spiked . Now he looks at the scar and says : " I am training only as a front runner . " <P> Running for Fun . Back home , that training involves running twice a day in Dar es Salaam , where Bachelor Bayi is an air force lieutenant and flight mechanic . Mornings he runs cross-country , covering about ten miles . After working on the cargo planes , he heads out for two hours of sprints , ranging from 100 to 1,000 meters . His program was the suggestion of an East German track coach who advised Bayi during a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayi , like most East African runners , had no formal coaching . He learned to run long distances in the fields around Karatu , his home town , located about 130 miles from the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro . For added sport , he dodged the leopards that hunted in the same area ( " I had to throw stones at one once , " says Bayi coolly . " He went his way , and I went mine " ) . In those days , he had " no program . I was just running for fun . "
