His staff is grooming him as a middle-of-the-roader <P> At his palatial home on Point Loma in San Diego , Savings and Loan King Kim Fletcher had gathered 150 real estate developers , oil contractors and other members of the local gentry to meet former Governor Ronald Reagan . For $200 each , the guests sipped drinks , munched on roast beef and chicken , and listened to the man who is universally considered to be the G.O.P. 's front-running candidate . <P> He did n't disappoint them . " I feel just fine . " he chuckled , waving aside the unmentioned fact that he is 68 . Holding out his glass of tonic water , he said , " Look , not even a ripple " ; and sure enough , the surface of the drink was as tranquil as the candidate 's mood . He told a questioner that he had just spent his August vacation at his Santa Barbara ranch putting in 400 ft. of fence posts the size of telephone poles . " Age is not a major question , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maturity - someone who remembers the Great Depression . " <P> Reagan dwelt upon a favorite theme from the past : the size and waste of Big Government . " The energy crisis is the doing of Government , " he said , and Washington should " turn the oil industry loose in the marketplace . " But then , as he neared the end of his remarks , he gave the party faithful a glimpse of the " new " candidate that his staff aides have been promising . Instead of urging an arms buildup against the Soviets , he called for a mutual cutback on strategic nuclear weapons . <P> He took the same line at the state Republican convention when he said SALT II was " fatally flawed " and should be renegotiated . But he opposed SALT II , said Reagan , because it does not " fairly and genuinely reduce " the number of nuclear weapons , and he would support a treaty that would diminish " nuclear armaments to the point that neither country represents a threat to the other . " Just three years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not come from weakness or retreat , it comes from restoration of American military superiority . " <P> The new strategy of moving toward the center is based on an assessment by his advisers that the former California Governor has the Republican nomination just about sewed up , and that he should begin courting middle-of-the-road voters for next fall 's election . Certainly he is far ahead in the polls . The Harris survey shows him leading Jimmy Carter , 51-44 ( while Reagan 's principal Republican opponent , John Connally , trails the President , 44-52 ) . Therefore his staff is creating what it calls an " expanded " or &; " more reflective " version of the old Reagan . Says his national political director Charles Black : " We must demonstrate that this guy is practical and has the ability to run the country . We will be offering solutions , not just criticisms .
