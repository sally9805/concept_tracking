txt National Assembly Deputy Tran Ngoc Chau has de ? cided that no recourse is left him in the South Vietnamese courts . Now he is making a moral and political appeal outside the legal system . " When I came here I already knew I would be sentenced , whether I had a lawyer or not , " the defendant said to the court at the end of his first full day of trial . " I came only to defend my human dignity . " Mr. Chau is charged by the government prosecutor with flagrant liaison with Communist cadres from November , 1965 , through April , 1969 . Mr. Chau has publicly acknowledged meeting his brother , Tran Ngoc Hien , a convicted North Vietnamese agent , in this period . Monday 's trial was a trial de novo following his sentencing in absentia last week to 20 years ' hard labor . The defendant appeared in court in the black pajamas of the Revolutionary Development cadres whom he once headed . In Mr. Chau 's case the charge is only that he met his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities to the South Vietnamese Government , although he did do so to the American Government . Last week 's in absentia judgment was automatically nullified by Mr. Chau 's arrest and appearance before the court . He had not appeared voluntarily before , claiming parliamentary immunity to prosecution . He was forcibly arrested Feb. 26 . The defense based its case on , jurisdictional and constitutional issues . The court denied all such issues , however , and it was after this denial that Mr. Chau decided to refuse to argument , e his case further . The legal issues raised in the trial were ( 1 ) parliamentary immunity and the legal process required to revoke it and ( 2 ) constitutionality of the Third Mobile Military Field Court , which has been conducting the trial . // *No recourse in Chau trial ? South Vietnamese case a major political issue // There are two constitutional provisions under which a senator or deputy can be tried . The first , Article 37 Paragraph 2 , re . quires the " approval " of three-fourths of the Senate or lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arrested , or judged . " The second , which requires no three-fourths majority , but only the " request of the House concerned , " occurs in cases of " flagrente delicto , " according to Article 37 , Paragraph 3 . This is a French legal concept which translates roughly into English as " caught in the act . " Government prosecution was undertaken first on the basis of a petition with 102 signatures of deputies  --  that is , exactly threeaourths of the lower house . The signatures were collected privately , individually , and with no time limit , rather than in plenary session of the House with open recorded debate . . Signatures repudiated Subsequently , the number of acknowledged signatures fell below the three-fourths minimum . Three of the deputies repudiated their signatures , alleging that their names ' had been forged , or that they had signed a different petition , one not calling for Mr. ' Chau 's prosecution . ? They contended that there were two pieces . of paper carried around during the campaign for signatures , one with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was no guarantee that the signatories knew what they were signing . , These points were raised by the defense in the trial but were not treated by the prosecutor . At the trial the defense did not raise the charges that some deputies have made ( out of court ) of extensive bribes and blackmail by the executive branch in the course of securing the 102 signatures . Perhaps because of the allegations of irregularities , the petition of the 102 deputies was not made the basis of the prosecution in the first , in absentia , trial . Instead , the indictment case was labelled as flagrente delicto , based on public statements Mr. Chau made in 1969 saying that he had met with his brother . In the full trial March 2 the defense lawyers asked for clarification as to which paragraph of the Constitution formed the basis of the trial . The prosecutor would not be pinned down to one or the other paragraph , but argued both that the 102 signatures sufficed to prosecute Mr. Chau and that this was in any case an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contested the jurisdiction of the court on the basis of separation of judicial , executive , and legislative branches . Judges in military courts are nominated by the President and the Minister of Defense . The defense argued that the miltary court , a residue from a previous era , does not conform to the new Constitution and its guarantee of the independence of judges . Legality argued The prosecutor argued that the military court retained its legality by virtue of having been established by decree law and never having been canceled by decree law or by legislative action . After deliberating , the court : ? Rejected the defense contention that the prosecution of Mr. Chau was illegal under Arcticle 37 . ? Rejected the defense request to refer the constitutional and legal issues to the supreme court for a ruling . ? Rejected the defense argument that the Third Mobile Military Field Court was itself unconstitutional . It declared the Chau case one of flagrente delicto in which a three-fourths majority of the House was'not required to strip the defendant of his parliamentary immunity . The defense lawyers then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supreme court could consider the constitutional issues raised . No appeal permitted Instead of allowing this request by the defenSe , however , the judge granted the prosecutor 's request that no appeal whatsoever be permitted to the supreme court . The prosecutor explained his position by saying that the Third Mobile Military Field Court was set up under special conditions and that after more than two years of the new Constitution , the Legislature still had not closed the military court . Thus the court automatically continues to have full power to judge special cases . The procedures of the court are therefore also special , he continued , But if the judge granted the defense appeal , then this court would lose its special character . Following the Monday trial , Mr , Chau asked his lawyers to withdraw and the following morning a new lawyer was nominated by the Lawyers ' Association on the condition that the nominee , Vo Van Quan , could have 15 days to study documents relating to the case . The judge , Lt. Col. Trieu Khac Huynh , gave Mr. Vo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent to argue the case Wednesday morning , the court was to follow its own rules for emergency cases and ask the prosecutor to nominate not a lawyer but a citizen with a law degree to act as lawyer for Mr. Chau . Swift trial sought The tactics of Mr. Chau 's supporters , then , are to make a political case if at all possible . They have been trying to draw out the court proceedings past the three-day strike of Vietnamese newspapers , which ends Wednesday night . ( The newspapers have been on strike over the government 's doubling the price of newsprint . There is some indication that government provocateurs encouraged the defiant editors and publishers to strike just at the time of the Chau trial . ) Government sources have told journalists that government instructions were that the trial be completed swiftly , on the first day of the trial de novo . The cause now may be taken up by President Thieu 's vocal opponent , Sen. Tran Van Don , who has just returned from a trip abroad . He is presently taking political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Army and his ties with some American politicians , Senator Don is relatively immune to any arrest or harassment by President Thieu . In the past he always has seized upon any issue that might embarrass Mr. Thieu . If the Chau case does become a major . political football , it will have the exact opposite result from Mr. Thieu 's intention in pressing the case . He clearly intended to damp down political opposition , not to stir it up .
